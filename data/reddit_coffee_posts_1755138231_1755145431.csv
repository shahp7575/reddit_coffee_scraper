1mpqfxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sankto/comments/1mpqfxx/lesson_1_sankto_leciono_1_sankto/,Lesson 1 Sankto | Leciono 1 Sankto,"I guess this would be basic sentence building! Like i stated before things are pretty similar to esperanto and it's mutually intelligible.

Word order:

The word order in Sankto is stricter than esperanto, it is strictly SVO (e.g. I am a human = Mi estas un homo)


Articles | Artikoloj:

 * la - The definite article, meaning 'the' (e.g. the dog = la hundo)

 * un - The indefinite article, meaning 'a' or 'an' (e.g. an apple or a coffee? = un pomo aŭ un kafo?)


Pronouns | Pronomoj:

 * ri/ria - functions similarly to they/them/theirs pronouns in English, ri = they/them (singular), ria = their/theirs (singular

 * li/lia - li = he/him, lia = his

 * ŝi/ŝia - ŝi = she/her, ŝia = hers

 * ĝi/ĝia - ĝi = it, ĝia = its

* mi/mia - mi = I/me, mia = my/mine

 * vi/via - vi = you, via = yours

 * ni/nia - ni = we/us, nia = our/ours

 * ili/ilia - ili = they/them (plural), ilia = their/theirs (plural)


Some simple nouns | Kelka simpla substantivoj:

Nouns in Sankto end in -o same as Esperanto!

 * viriĉo - man

 * virino - woman

 * viro - nonbinary/genderless person

 * knabo - nonbinary/ genderless child

 * knabiĉo - boy

 * knabino - girl

 * hundo - dog

 * kato - cat

 * birdo - bird

 * pomo - apple

 * kafo - coffee

 * domo - house

 * libro - book

 * tablo - table

The difference of base nouns like viro and knabo is that they can be used in two ways, one is how we use words in english like ""The person at the table"" ""La viro ĉe la tablo"" where we don't use  male or female words to describe them, and it can also be used deliberately for nonbinary people like ""My friend is ___"" ""Mia amiko estas viro"". 

The opposite is true for male or female animals like hundo or kato if I wanted to say a male cat and a female dog it would be ""un katiĉo kaj un hundino"" or ""un viriĉa kato kaj un virina hundo."" 


Plurals | Pluraloj:
The plural ending is -j for things like dogs = hundoj men = viriĉoj 


Adjectives | Adjektivoj:

Adjectives in sankto and esperanto end with -a and some nouns can be turned into adjectives! Like viriĉo which means man can be turned into viriĉa and mean manly!

Note that the plural ending does not affect adjectives like in esperanto, in sankto it would be beautiful birds = bela birdoj, but in esperanto it would be beautiful birds = belaj birdoj. 

 * bela - beautiful

 * malbela - ugly

 * granda - big

 * malgranda - small

 * bona - good

 * malbona - bad

 * juna - young

 * maljuna - old

 * peza - heavy

 * malpeza - light


The verb esti and its simple variations | La verbo esti kaj ĝia simpla variaĵoj:

 * esti - to be (infinitive) (e.g. esti aŭ ne esti = to be or not to be)

 * estas - am, is, are (present tense) (e.g. Mi estas feliĉa = I am happy)

 * estis - was, were (past tense) (e.g. Ili estis tie = They were there)

 * estos - will be (future tense) (e.g. Mi estos tie = I will be there)

 * estu - be! Should be (volitive, commanding) (e.g. Estu silenta! = Be quiet!

 * estus - would be, were (conditional) (e.g. Se mi estus vi = If I were you)

1mpqfxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mpqfxl/aita_for_reconnecting_with_a_friend_that_my/,aita for reconnecting with a friend that my partner doesn't like?,"I (23f) had a falling out with a friend (25f) about a year ago, and we have recently reconnected and decided that we miss each other and want to work on rebuilding our friendship. We'll call her Sarah. Sarah used to be my roommate. My partner (25m) has never liked Sarah, and Sarah has never liked my partner (we'll call him Luke). 

Luke and I have been dating for almost two years and we currently live together. We moved into together fairly recently, but I haven't lived with Sarah for a little over a year now. After I moved out from the house I shared with Sarah, Luke was furious at her because he had seen how torn up I was about losing our friendship, and he admitted to me that he had never liked her. I told him that it was okay because Sarah had admitted to me that she had never liked Luke. This really set Luke off, and it pushed him into this full on hatred for Sarah. 

Well, last week I invited Sarah out to go on a hike with a mutual friend of ours, Claire. She agreed, and I mentioned that I missed being friends and wanted to work on rebuilding our friendship. She said she felt the same way, and we made plans to hang out this week. When I got home from the hike, I told Luke that Sarah had joined me and Claire on our hike and that Sarah and I wanted to rebuild the friendship. He was furious, and he said that I lied to him by not mentioning that Sarah was going to be joining me and Claire. I agreed that I had omitted that part from him originally but only because I knew that he didn't like her and only because I wasn't sure that Sarah wanted to be friends again. I did tell him the same day after I got home from the hike. He left the apartment and went to his mom's to talk it over with her, saying to me that he knows Sarah is going to hurt me again and that he couldn't trust me for lying to him. 

We eventually sorted that out, though i'm still not sure if either of us were completely in the wrong in that situation as I know that I intentionally omitted the truth, but I think that he kind of blew the situation up way larger than it had to be. I agreed that I wouldn't keep things from him, even if I thought they were to protect him, even if they were only temporary secrets. But that is not the point of this post. 

He says that he understands why I miss Sarah as he has been in a similar situation with some of his friends and has reached out to them to try and mend things. He couldn't stand when I mentioned that she and i are going to catch up, and got really mad when I recently told him that Sarah and I have plans to meet for coffee this week. He grew quiet and his voice got kind of steely. I noticed this change, and I asked him what was wrong. He said that he didn't want to talk about it, so I asked if it was about Sarah, and he said yes. I left it at that, but he started getting up and saying things like ""she's not even going to apologize to me for what she said about me"" and ""she doesn't like me"" kind of all moody and stuff. 

I love Luke, but Sarah was my best friend. I don't want to have to choose between them. I honestly dont even want to necessarily talk to Sarah about Luke anymore because I don't really want her advice about Luke or Luke's advice about Sarah, but I already promised to not keep any sort of secrets from Luke, and I'm nervous that he's going to try and push me to get Sarah to apologize to him. I don't know. I don't even know if this situation makes sense. I hate drama and I fear that Luke and Sarah are both a bit dramatic at times and that they both can have intense emotions.

Have you ever forgotten your phone?


When did you realise you’d forgotten it? I’m guessing you didn’t just smack your forehead and exclaim ‘damn’ apropos of nothing. The realisation probably didn’t dawn on you spontaneously. More likely, you reached for your phone, pawing open your pocket or handbag, and were momentarily confused by it not being there. Then you did a mental restep of the morning’s events. 


Shit.


In my case, my phone’s alarm woke me up as normal but I realised the battery was lower than I expected. It was a new phone and it had this annoying habit of leaving applications running that drain the battery overnight. So, I put it on to charge while I showered instead of into my bag like normal. It was a momentary slip from the routine but that was all it took. Once in the shower, my brain got back into ‘the routine’ it follows every morning and that was it. 


Forgotten.


This wasn’t just me being clumsy, as I later researched, this is a recognised brain function. Your brain doesn’t just work on one level, it works on many. Like, when you’re walking somewhere, you think about your destination and avoiding hazards, but you don’t need to think about keeping your legs moving properly. If you did, the entire world would turn into one massive hilarious QWOP cosplay. I wasn’t thinking about regulating my breathing, I was thinking whether I should grab a coffee on the drive to work (I did). I wasn’t thinking about moving my breakfast through my intestines, I was wondering whether I’d finish on time to pick up my daughter Emily from nursery after work or get stuck with another late fee. This is the thing; there’s a level of your brain that just deals with routine, so that the rest of the brain can think about other things.


Think about it. Think about your last commute. What do you actually remember? Little, if anything, probably. Most common journeys blur into one, and recalling any one in particular is scientifically proven to be difficult. Do something often enough and it becomes routine. Keep doing it and it stops being processed by the thinking bit of the brain and gets relegated to a part of the brain dedicated to dealing with routine. Your brain keeps doing it, without you thinking about it. Soon, you think about your route to work as much as you do keeping your legs moving when you walk. As in, not at all.


Most people call it autopilot. But there’s danger there. If you have a break in your routine, your ability to remember and account for the break is only as good as your ability to stop your brain going into routine mode. My ability to remember my phone being on the counter is only as reliable as my ability to stop my brain entering ‘morning routine mode’ which would dictate that my phone is actually in my bag. But I didn’t stop my brain entering routine mode. I got in the shower as normal. Routine started. Exception forgotten.


Autopilot engaged.


My brain was back in the routine. I showered, I shaved, the radio forecast amazing weather, I gave Emily her breakfast and loaded her into the car (she was so adorable that morning, she complained about the ‘bad sun’ in the morning blinding her, saying it stopped her having a little sleep on the way to nursery) and left. That was the routine.  It didn’t matter that my phone was on the counter, charging silently. My brain was in the routine and in the routine my phone was in my bag. This is why I forgot my phone. Not clumsiness. Not negligence. Nothing more my brain entering routine mode and over-writing the exception.


Autopilot engaged.


I left for work. It’s a swelteringly hot day already. The bad sun had been burning since before my traitorously absent phone woke me. The steering wheel was burning hot to the touch when I sat down. I think I heard Emily shift over behind my driver’s seat to get out of the glare. But I got to work. Submitted the report. Attended the morning meeting. It’s not until I took a quick coffee break and reached for my phone that the illusion shattered. I did a mental restep. I remembered the dying battery. I remembered putting it on to charge. I remembered leaving it there. 


My phone was on the counter.


Autopilot disengaged.


Again, therein lies the danger. Until you have that moment, the moment you reach for your phone and shatter the illusion, that part of the brain is still in routine mode. It has no reason to question the facts of the routine; that’s why it’s a routine. Attrition of repetition. It’s not as if anyone could say ‘why didn’t you remember your phone? Didn’t it occur to you? How could you forget? You must be negligent’; this is to miss the point. My brain was telling me the routine was completed as normal, despite the fact that it wasn’t. It wasn’t that I forgot my phone. According to my brain, according to the routine, my phone was in my bag. Why would I think to question it? Why would I check? Why would I suddenly remember, out of nowhere, that my phone was on the counter? My brain was wired into the routine and the routine was that my phone was in my bag.


The day continued to bake. The morning haze gave way to the relentless fever heat of the afternoon. Tarmac bubbled. The direct beams of heat threatened to crack the pavement. People swapped coffees for iced smoothies. Jackets discarded, sleeves rolled up, ties loosened, brows mopped. The parks slowly filled with sunbathers and BBQ’s. Window frames threatened to warp. The thermometer continued to swell. Thank fuck the offices were air conditioned.


But, as ever, the furnace of the day gave way to a cooler evening. Another day, another dollar. Still cursing myself for forgetting my phone, I drove home. The days heat had baked the inside of the car, releasing a horrible smell from somewhere. When I arrived on the driveway, the stones crunching comfortingly under my tyres, my wife greeted me at the door.


“Where’s Emily?”


Fuck.


As if the phone wasn’t bad enough. After everything I’d left Emily at the fucking nursery after all. I immediately sped back to the nursery. I got to the door and started practising my excuses, wondering vainly if I could charm my way out of a late fee. I saw a piece of paper stuck to the door.


“Due to vandalism overnight, please use side door. Today only.”


Overnight? What? The door was fine this morni-.


I froze. My knees shook.

Vandals. A change in the routine.


My phone was on the counter.


I hadn’t been here this morning.


My phone was on the counter.


I’d driven past because I was drinking my coffee. I’d not dropped off Emily.


My phone was on the counter.


She’d moved her seat. I hadn’t seen her in the mirror.


My phone was on the counter.


She’d fallen asleep out of the bad sun. She didn’t speak when I drove past her nursery. 


My phone was on the counter.


She’d changed the routine.


My phone was on the counter.


She’d changed the routine and I’d forgotten to drop her off.


My phone was on the counter.


9 hours. That car. That baking sun. No air. No water. No power. No help. That heat. A steering wheel too hot to touch.


That smell.


I walked to the car door. Numb. Shock. 


I opened the door.


My phone was on the counter and my daughter was dead.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern tree rug market boasts a diverse range of features designed to cater to various tastes and needs. From material composition to construction techniques, each element plays a crucial role in the rug's overall quality, durability, and aesthetic appeal.

**Material Composition**

The materials used in tree rugs vary significantly.These range from natural fibers like wool, cotton, and jute, to synthetic options such as acrylic, polyester, and nylon. Wool rugs are prized for their durability, softness, and natural stain resistance. Cotton rugs offer a softer, more breathable option, while jute rugs provide a rustic, textured feel. Synthetic options offer cost-effectiveness and enhanced stain resistance, making them suitable for high-traffic areas or households with pets and children. The choice of material significantly impacts the rug's longevity, maintenance requirements, and overall comfort.

**Construction and Weave**

Tree rugs are available in various construction styles, including hand-knotted, hand-tufted, machine-made, and flatweave. Hand-knotted rugs are the most labour-intensive and expensive,known for their remarkable quality and intricate designs. Hand-tufted rugs offer a more affordable alternative, providing a similar aesthetic with a quicker manufacturing process. Machine-made rugs are the most budget-friendly option, offering consistent quality and a wide range of designs. Flatweave rugs, like kilims, are lightweight and reversible, perfect for layering or adding a textural element to a space. The construction method affects the rug's durability, texture, and overall value.

**Design and Pattern**

Tree rugs come in a variety of tree-inspired designs, from realistic depictions of individual trees to abstract, artistic interpretations of forests and woodlands. Some rugs feature detailed illustrations of leaves, branches, and tree trunks, while others incorporate subtle, geometric patterns inspired by nature. The color palettes range from earthy tones like greens, browns, and beiges, to more vibrant hues that add a pop of color to the room. The design and pattern significantly contribute to the rug's aesthetic impact and its ability to complement the existing décor.

**Size and Shape**

Tree rugs are available in a variety of sizes and shapes to suit different spaces and needs. Common shapes include rectangular, round, oval, and runner rugs. Rectangular rugs are versatile and can be used in living rooms, bedrooms, and dining rooms. Round rugs can add a focal point to a room and soften the lines of square or rectangular furniture. Runner rugs are ideal for hallways and entryways, adding warmth and visual interest. the size of a tree rug should be proportionate to the room and the furniture around it, ensuring a balanced and harmonious aesthetic.

**Pile Height and Texture**

The pile height of a tree rug refers to the length of the fibers,which influences its texture and overall feel. High-pile rugs are plush and luxurious, providing a soft and agreeable surface underfoot. Low-pile rugs are more durable and easier to clean, making them suitable for high-traffic areas. Some tree rugs feature a combination of high and low piles to create a textured, dimensional effect that enhances their visual appeal. The texture of a tree rug can also be influenced by the materials used and the construction method, adding another layer of sensory interest to the design.**Sustainability and Ethical Production**

Increasingly, consumers are seeking eco-friendly and ethically produced tree rugs. Rugs made from enduring materials like recycled fibers, organic cotton, or responsibly harvested wool are gaining popularity. Fair trade practices ensure that artisans and workers involved in the production process are treated fairly and compensated adequately. Certifications such as Oeko-Tex and GoodWeave provide assurance that the rug is free from harmful chemicals and produced in a safe and ethical manner. The sustainability and ethical production of tree rugs reflect a growing commitment to environmental and social obligation.

## Core Benefits

Tree rugs offer a multitude of benefits that extend beyond their aesthetic appeal, enhancing the comfort, functionality, and overall ambiance of a living space.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** Tree rugs bring a touch of nature's beauty indoors,adding a unique and visually appealing element to any room.

Its ability to insulate the floor also helps to retain heat, especially during colder months, leading to potential energy savings.

**Noise Reduction and Sound Absorption:** Tree rugs help to absorb sound and reduce noise levels in a room. Their dense fibers act as a natural sound barrier, dampening echoes and minimizing the transmission of sound thru the floor. This is notably beneficial in apartments or homes with hardwood floors, where noise can be a notable issue.By adding a tree rug to your space, you can create a more peaceful and relaxing surroundings, free from distracting noises and unwanted reverberations.

**Protection of Flooring:** Tree rugs provide a protective layer for your flooring, preventing scratches, scuffs, and other damage.

This is especially important for delicate or expensive flooring materials like hardwood, tile, or marble. By investing in a tree rug, you can extend the life of your flooring and save money on future repairs or replacements.

**Defining Spaces:** Tree rugs can effectively define and delineate different areas within an open-concept living space. By strategically placing a tree rug under a seating area, dining table, or workstation, you can create a visual boundary that separates these zones and establishes a sense of order and organization. This is particularly useful in small apartments or homes with limited square footage, where every space needs to be used efficiently. A well-placed tree rug can transform an open space into a series of distinct and functional areas, enhancing its overall usability and appeal.

Aqua of the Seas – sails through Lan Ha Bay, known for its calm, crystal-clear waters and secluded beaches. The ship features elegant design, a spacious sundeck, an outdoor Jacuzzi, and a glass-walled dining room with panoramic views.



Aqua Elegance – cruises through Halong Bay, taking guests past iconic sights such as the Fighting Cocks Islet and Sung Sot Cave. With a modern style and plenty of open spaces, it’s perfect for those who love natural light and photography.



Both ships offer 5-star service, spacious cabins, refined cuisine combining fresh seafood with Asian and Western dishes, and a warm, professional crew. My favorite moment was sipping hot coffee on the deck at sunrise, watching the limestone peaks emerge from the morning mist – simply unforgettable.



If you prefer tranquility, Aqua of the Seas is ideal. If you want to see Halong’s world-famous landmarks, Aqua Elegance is the perfect choice. 🌊⛴

1mpq8l7,https://i.redd.it/ine8dtfbtwif1.png,[Comic Excerpt] My favorite subtle moment from (The New Gods #8),"This is a moment spread between two pages that I just kinda LOVE for Orion's characterization. The fact that in the middle of this important speech from the High Father, he was playing with his little niece, and his face is still caught in the duck lips he was making at her to get her to laugh as everyone turns to him.

I've discovered it's the small moments in comics that win me over, the difference between if something is just Good to me or Absolute Peak. (I knew I was gonna love the Superboy: Man of Tomorrow comic run for example when they had the little detail of the single fallen coffee cup and it being Superboy's that had spilled.) Because they aren't needed for the plot, but do SUCH heavy lifting in communicating about the characters and why we should care about them.

And as someone who has been a lowkey fan of Orion's for \*ages\* but kinda gave up on him having good characterization again. Well. I am FEASTING. Because they could've just had him Symbolically Holding The Baby in a calm standard way, but no. Duck lips. Him realizing halfway through something serious is going on and awkwardly holding Liv. Urgh it's perfection.

After my last post about going NC, he reached out and we started up again and “stronger”. This morning I missed his call and so I called back on my way to work. He asks me where I am, where this and that, what street sign I think. I’m driving, 10 cars are all trying to go different ways, I barely had sleep because of my puppy, I can’t concentrate and I get very anxious from cars after a few serious accidents I’ve been in so I was focusing. Once I got out of that mess I said “what’re you trying to ask?” And he mumbled something and hung up and I haven’t heard from him since.

My guess is based on our history he thinks I’m lying. Tbh I don’t care today. I don’t care to reach out because I’m tired. I mean, honestly in the morning trying to get up and function is hard for me I just didn’t care to answer all the questions he was bombarding me with today, I just wanted to focus on driving and drinking my coffee. 

I think I’m okay if he doesn’t reach out to me and stays mad about something like this. Why? One reason is I honestly am annoyed with how many celebrity crushes he has. It’s to a point I feel like he doesn’t actually have a type. I just don’t like the whole easy to fall for everyone type. Petty of me, I know. Secondly, I’m tired of how I feel and stress about him and his W And family. And lastly, I just have a lot on my plate atm.

to begin with the most recent things, i wanted to have a chat with him about something i was facing that was affecting my comfort at bible study but he insisted to catch up and have a chat privately just the two of us instead on a different day. on the same day, he bought me a coffee and drove me to a chemist to get period pain relief meds (i guess he overheard me saying i had cramps with my girl friends from bible study). for a bit more context, i bought him lunch this one time because he forgot to take his wallet (he’s old school and doesn’t have his card on his phone). during bible study, i realised he has been saying a lot of slang/lingo and even doing gestures that i often do. also during this, we were doing an activity requiring drawing and i happen to be standing up (everyone else was sitting) in which i didn’t even notice myself, but he pointed it out laughing “i like how you’re standing up just to draw lines”. i felt embarrassed and sat down and he proceeded to say something along the lines with “no no i find it funny and like how you’re being yourself”. 

those all are just things that happened within the span of like 3 days ago. there are other moments like these where he would notice and point out that i’m wearing a different hairstyle etc or dragging me out of group conversations/settings to just talk to me. to bring more context of his character though, he is very much friendly. he’s like a ball of sunshine, energy of a puppy almost. he gets along well with everyone, no matter who it is or how long he has known you. he’s also a med student so i figured with the whole situation where he bought me period meds was just an act out of interest from his course idk. whenever he would talk to me, he would kind of soften his tone of his voice, kind of lean down a bit to hear me and the eye contact is kept like throughout the entire conversation. oh and i forgot to mention he’s one of the leaders of the bible study group, along with another girl where he would have private chats with her.

all my friends say he likes me but idk maybe the signs are crystal clear i just choose not to believe them. he also has like other girl friends and he would like side hug them too and get along with them as well. i mean he’s a leader, it’s expected for him to be kind to everyone and be welcoming so i figured that might just be who he is. 

oh and one other instance i think i should include is that as a group, we would have random chats and this one time we were talking about our past relationships. we all took turns sharing if we felt comfortable and i shared that i was previously in one relationship that i recently broken up with. he would ask questions like “are you still talking to him?” and “how long were you together?”, which are normal questions sparking curiousity but mind you he was the only person really asking questions and everyone else was just tuning in. 

oh yeah and if you know me from my previous post about that one guy (let’s call him tim) trying to pursue me but the feelings weren’t mutual, well after tim offered to “carry me” because my feet hurt, he (m24) was actually there hearing all this and he got suddenly quiet and didn’t talk much which wasn’t like him at all. when questioned, he said he was tired but he kept fidgeting with a giftcard he had in his hands and avoided conversation with anyone else. just before tim said that, he was being his normal bubbly and witty self.

sorry for the long essay of a reddit post but idk let me know what you think. tbh it’s probably painfully obviously but knowing me i won’t get it until the day i hear him actually confess to my face. ",1,1755144058.0,ChristianDating,0,1.0,False
1mpq4bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1mpq4bl/trying_to_import_green_coffee_for_first_time/,Trying to Import Green Coffee for First Time,"Hey all,

I’m coordinating my first shipment of green coffee from a farm in Colombia to a roaster in the U.S., and I’d love advice from anyone who’s done this before.

The setup:
	•	Buyer is a U.S.-based coffee shop and roaster.
	•	First time importing coffee — they’re concerned about the shipment being held or seized at customs.
	•	The farm connected us with a freight forwarder in Colombia who came recommended.
	•	We’ve been quoted DDP (Delivered Duty Paid), and the forwarder says all costs and clearance are included.
	•	Exporter will handle Colombian paperwork (commercial invoice, packing list, export declaration).
	•	We do not have a U.S.-based customs broker lined up.

Questions I’m trying to get clarity on:
	1.	Even with a DDP shipment, does the U.S. buyer need any specific license, registration, or importer number to receive green coffee?
	2.	Will a Colombian forwarder’s DDP arrangement fully cover FDA prior notice, customs bond, and CBP entry on the U.S. side?
	3. Have you seen DDP coffee shipments still get delayed or seized? If so, why?
      4. For first-timers, what’s the biggest “gotcha” to watch for in green coffee imports?

We just want to make sure nothing slips through the cracks before we ship. Any tips, checklists, or broker recommendations would be hugely appreciated.

Thanks!

**RECAP / TL,DRs**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/ylqkgTrIT4): **July 14, 2025**

OOP has frustrations with her in-laws, whom she and her husband are no-contact for over nine years due to repeated boundary violations. In-laws have been attempting to solicit money and gifts from people, including OOP, her family, and acquaintances, under the guise of ""dorm shower"" for their granddaughter. Request includes a staggering $100,000 for dorm fees and expensive items from a registry with high prices. Despite the in-laws' well-off financial situation, they target OOP’s elderly relatives for contributions. After receiving series of unwanted communications, including unsolicited calls and voicemails demanding money, OOP reaffirms her commitment on her no contact with in-laws, even with harassment going on.

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/iNLBIi1oc3): **July 22, 2025 (eight days later)**

OOP updated on the ongoing no-contact stance with in-laws, particularly regarding absurd $100,000 request for her niece's dorm fees and gifts. Despite blocking calls and Google Voice, OOP still received dozens of calls from unfamiliar numbers, which she suspects from her MIL's supporters. She consulted with a lawyer, but legally, there's not much that can be done to stop the harassment. In-laws attempt to rent a church banquet room for a dorm shower, despite not being current members or ""stewards"" of the church. MIL is trying to bend rules, from requesting discounts based on outdated membership to attempting to bring her own food and liquor, and even planning to charge entry and run a cash bar for profit. The church is firm on its policies.

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/Q8JHborbsM): **August 3, 2025 (almost two weeks later)**

***I am not a FUCKING bot, AI, or farming --- please DON'T vote if that's what you think is happening because it genuinely makes no difference to me!***

**Background:** My in-laws, both MILs and FILs sides, are incredibly large, conservative, and really don't like progress or change. They believe in keeping people in ""their place"" and how things ""should be"". They also operate like a hive, if one hates you then most of them will hate you and they will come after you with a Bible thumping vengeance.

MIL's wealthiest brother has/had (hasn't been heard from since the early 90's) a son who they discovered was gay. They disowned him. Same wealthy brother has another son who got secretly married to a woman who had a child from a previous relationship, and they disowned him as well because he married someone who had a child (oh the scandal and the IRONY --- Mary/Joseph/Jesus, ringing any bells?). I remember MIL was fully supporting her brother and his stupidity as far as I know, the second son hasn't been seen or heard from since the mid 90's.

All that to say, they will not accept or open their hearts to anything that they disagree with, regardless of relationship or familial bond. Mil is her brothers biggest supporter or instigating enabler depending on how you look at it.

**Guests and registries:** A longtime friend was invited to the ""dorm shower"". She is a friend of mine and my husbands and an acquaintance of SIL and my in-laws, we all went to grade and highschool together and she shares the same culture and speaks the same language as my husband/in-laws. She was also one of the many people the inlaws harassed trying to get our phone numbers. She and a few other invitees were debating on going to the ""dorm shower"" because on more than one occasion SIL and her family have shown up to their events empty handed, with extra not invited people, and often without RSVP'ing.

So they decided to return the favor by bringing uninvited guests, eating and drinking their fill, and only giving niece a dollar store, NOT HALLMARK, card (signed by all of them) filled with nothing but their well wishes (which is still far more than what SIL had brought them to their traditional gift-giving events).

Being the good and exceptionally thorough friend that she is, she said that more stuff had been added to the registries, some even at slightly lower price points (but still very pricey in her opinion like a $40 single spatula) and  SHOCKINGLY most of the stuff requested on the registry had been bought the last time she checked.

I guess this dorm shower is now a ""thing."" I just can't even wrap my mind around crap like that!

**Leading up to the party:** They were scrambling (I'm guessing) to find tables, chairs, tents and catering --- everything is very last minute with them 

Party rental places exist for EXACTLY THIS REASON!

They even had the nerve to leave a message on my parents answering machine asking if they could ""borrow"" their tables, chairs, and pop-up tents?

Uhhhhh... My parents haven't had contact with any of you for over 8 years. So, no! No, you may not borrow their stuff!!!! 

They couldn't be bothered to call and check on my mom when she was diagnosed with cancer and going through treatment, but for niece's party they remembered their phone number, priorities I guess. 😕🖕

did I mention 🖕

My parents ignored them.

My dad also started (very intentional timing) doing some minor repairs on the church hall, as well as setting up the HVAC cleaning, carpet cleaning, and dance floor polishing during and after the week of niece's party. 

The church hall will be unavailable till mid August

**Catering:** My brother has been in the restaurant business for over 30 years. He currently owns a few food trucks that have a popular following as well as a catering/commercial kitchen.

I don't think my in-laws know about my brother owning the food trucks/catering business because they left a message and wanted to inquire about them for a party without mentioning him directly. 

Knowing them, If they knew, they'd try and get it for free because faaaaamily 

MIL has a very distinct voice -- there is no mistaking it and my brother knew right away it was her. 

***Just to paint a picture of MIL: Do you remember Herman Munster from the show The Munsters? Picture a tall, permanently surprised looking (bad plastic surgery, probably used a coupon), female version (with the same hairstyle) of Herman Munster who acts and talks like a ditzy helpless confused baby while using a weird baby voice and tries to manipulate everyone around her. She has a master's degree in education!***

My brother is not only uncle to my children but he's also their godfather --- he's very protective of them and is fully aware of the fuckery we've been put through. 

So my brother calls me and asks me, what do I want him to do? 

I tell him to do whatever he wants, I'm not going to take money out of his pocket but I warn him that she will delay paying the bill and complain constantly, so make sure she pays upfront (before you remove a single tray from the truck) and she specifically signs verifying full delivery (so she doesn't pretend she was shorted food) pictures and video would be a MUST ***(and as a bonus, I would get a peak at the ""dorm shower"". What?! I'm curious and reporting for Reddit 🧐 totally justifiable)***

My brother had his partner return the call on speaker phone and I'm muted but listening in on my brother's phone.

MIL wants the food truck(s) to show up at SILs house, park on the street or the lawn and have the invited guests BUY their food. 

***(I mean what could POSSIBLY go wrong with a plan like that?! Surely all the other people living on the block would be thrilled to have their neighborhood packed with people, noise, and overrun by cars and food trucks in a very limited parking area on a weekend with no prior warning)*** 

Not to mention, they're throwing a party with the expectation of EXPENSIVE gifts and they can't be bothered to ACTUALLY properly host. 

I can't even begin to understand how to tell your INVITED GUESTS that they need to BUY their own food at YOUR party

***Like, thanks for the $400 coffee maker that you purchased for a completely made-up ""dorm shower"" and if you're hungry, you can BUY YOURSELF a kabob dinner from the food truck on the corner for 15 bucks, drink sold separately -- don't forget to tip because I don't want it to look like I invited a bunch of cheapskates to my party*** 

Okie dokie 👌 

Super terrific plan there sparky!
 
***IDIOTS!*** My brother's partner says they can't do that but they could cater and drop off pans of food either all at once or in intervals depending on the size of the order.

The partner asks about how many people, what they're looking at in terms of menu, if they want them to provide cutlery and plates, basic stuff. 

***BTW -- When they were trying to book the church (last post) they said over 200 people were expected. They only wanted to order enough food for 50 people.*** 

***So what's the plan if EVERYONE you invited shows up? Do you make them wrestle for their dinner --- last-man standing gets a drumstick? Do you go around taking food off of people's plates? How do they make this, make sense in their brains and how can they NOT be embarrassed --- I would be mortified?! For real, what's the fucking plan? This type of stupidity makes my brain twitch***

Moving on...

They go over the terms, deposit amount, remainder due prior to them unloading and delivering the food. And just for funsies, he quoted them a price 25% more than what he would typically charge

MIL balks at the fact that they expect deposit upon signing the contract and payment before they handover the prepared catered food (she wanted to be ""billed"" after the fact)--- uhhhh....  lady (and I use that term loosely) you have a reputation and they know you're an entitled grifting mooching clown ***(🎶BECAUSE I TOLD THEM🎶)*** and I've seen your scam in action, so yeah -- you need to pay in full.

My brother made sure to call his MANY friends in the business, give MILs and SILs names and warn them to get payment upfront, upcharge because they're going to demand a discount, and to expect issues if they cater to them.

MIL said she'll call them back. She didn't, hmmmmm... I wonder why

**Change of location:** According to both my friend and my husband's Aunt, a few days before the party was supposed to happen, they sent out a text update on the location:

***Due to everyone wanting to support and celebrate (niece) we are moving the location to (Forest preserve) enter off of (Street name) and follow the signs and balloons.***

My friend made a comment about them ACTUALLY having some common sense for once and at least there will be plenty of parking. Not a horrible plan.... Until it was 🤣

**Day of party:** ***(This is what my friend told me, I wasn't actually there. I took notes as we were talking)***

Party was supposed to start at around 3pm and go until sundown when the preserve closes 

My friend arrives at around 4ish. She sees tents, tables, chairs, smells BBQ, music is bumping, tons of people, porta potties available and discreetly off to the side. It's so unexpectedly classy and put together --- she's legitimately impressed. She parks, and starts walking towards the party area. 

***Too bad that's NOT the ""dorm shower"" party.*** 

She realizes her mistake and finally finds the ""dorm shower"". As she's walking into the actual ""dorm shower"" area, she sees other friends/acquaintances already leaving --- they say hi/bye and everyone keeps it rolling. She said that it looked like Niece's ""dorm shower"" was set-up with all the stuff that the other party rejected. 

There are multiple mismatched tables set up for the gifts and cards. What looked like a younger teen/tween acting as a DJ and playing a variety of music that you could barely hear (both cultural and American) on a Bluetooth speaker. There is one much smaller uneven square table set up with a few bowls of uncovered chips and pretzels (being circled by flies and gnats), plastic cups, napkins, and nothing else.

My friend said that it looked like some people went out and bought their own food (McDonald's & Taco Bell) and were eating as she went around to say hello but no actual buffet or BBQ or any type of indication that they would be setting up for one. There were multiple kegs sitting under a tree in buckets of ice. There was no covered enclosures, tables, or available chairs. 

No bathrooms available except for the porta potties that had been rented and paid for by the other group and apparently they made it crystal clear that they weren't going to share 🤣. My friend had gone to the party straight after work and was told to go elsewhere. My friend said that it looked like SIL just brought some chairs from her home for the older relatives and everyone else was either standing or sitting directly on the grass 

Yup, sounds about right! 

No real food, no coverage from the blazing sun, no place to sit, no place to piss --- but plenty of booze (hydration is important --- especially for the teens) and a place to collect presents.  (My friend didn't see nor was she offered any other food or drinks when she arrived)

The in-law ""clan"" was there in full force and people had come in for this event.

My friend said there was a decently large turnout (she didn't do an actual headcount but thought it was about 150 people more-or-less with people coming and going) of family, adult/parent friends, lots of school friends, and it looked like niece got a TON of gifts. My friend was waiting on the rest of her friends to make an appearance, say their hellos, and then they were going to probably leave because there wasn't food and they're not huge into drinking.

In the meantime, SILs husband shows up with the cake. 

They cut the cake and place teeny tiny one-bite squares on napkins and hand those out (nobody is getting diabetes on their watch 🤣)

 Then my in-laws grab a megaphone and made a speech of how proud they are (yada yada), then niece's parents made a speech and told her how proud they are, (yada yada), deserved the world, (yada yada), and that they bought her a house....

***YA'LL, THEY BOUGHT HER A FUCKIN HOUSE*** (I think we just solved the mystery request for $100,000 in ""dorm fees"" and the luxurious dorm shower registry)

and some of you called it!

***(Don't I feel stupid now! I worked and actually earned every property I've ever owned. I didn't realize that all I had to do was call multiple people up, lie and ask for hundreds of thousands of dollars ---  tell them that I would be disappointed if they didn't cough up their life savings and they ""owed"" it to me... Welp, live and learn! I'll be sure to pass that bit of genius mixed with entitlement and a little spattering of narcissistic extortion onto my own children 🙄 Seriously, WTF!? PLUS --- on what planet is getting money from other people and buying your kid a house YOU buying them a house?)***

According to my friend, multiple people are recording this --- pretty sure video of this is circulating somewhere. Niece didn't seem surprised about the house. And they now want niece to make a speech. Niece says some stuff about her life and future, thanked everyone for coming, and she wants to introduce the love of her life --- her girlfriend, and she proceeded to hug and kiss her girlfriend in front of everyone. 

My friend said that my in-laws and the clan just sat there silent (she said they looked frozen) while the school friends and some other guests clapped and cheered. Then something started happening with the clan and MIL's rich brother got up along with his wife and adult children, they snatched stuff off the gift table and he started yelling at MIL in a mix of English and their native language, that he wants his money (or all his money) back or he's going to take the house (or houses). 

My friend was trying to make it look like she wasn't paying attention, but she TOTALLY was 😳😲👀. Something about him being a fool or being made a fool and something about lying ---- my friend caught parts of the conversation. 

Then in their native language he was saying something about (using a vulgar descriptive slur word in their language) the lesbians were coming, the lesbians were coming (over and over) as they were heading away from the party (directly in front of my friend) on their way towards the parking lot (I guess MIL got her parade of idiots after all)

***My friend is telling me what went down and all I could think about was Paul Revere's midnight ride --- which shouldn't be funny but... I could just picture a sour faced miserable old man grabbing gifts away from the table and warning anyone who would listen that the lesbians were coming, the lesbians were coming.***

My friend said that Mil and SIL went chasing after him, but friend couldn't hear what was being said. It looked like uncle's son was also yelling at MIL and SIL. There was lots of yelling and pointing going on. The rest of the clan looked to be leaving, some took their gifts back while others just left. The other guests were just standing around awkwardly not really knowing what to do. Niece and her girlfriend just went back to their group of friends. My friend said that niece didn't seem to care about what happened -- she wasn't crying or visibly upset. My friend has no idea where FIL and niece's dad went. She didn't see them again after they gave their speeches. My friend was like WTF JUST HAPPENED -- she went to her car and called the group she was waiting on --- not to come, drove home, and called me with a full report. 

***TLDR: To be clear --- my perspective is,  love is love. Niece is living her truth and good for her. MIL, however, instigated and supported her brother cutting off his own children --- and now her money train is PISSED and I'm guessing there will be hell to pay. I don't think niece's parents or my in-laws knew that niece is a lesbian because I don't think they'd want it advertised and I don't think they would have thrown a party that included very conservative relatives who they had gotten money from if they knew.***

**Aunt:** I called my husbands Aunt and filled her in on what went down. She hadn't heard anything yet but she said that MIL's brother and his son are control freaks that you don't want to piss off. Aunt wasn't surprised at their reactions. 

***Context for the comment below***

Aunt is a staunch LGBTQ+ supporter --- her sibling and two of her children identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. This comment stems from a conversation she had with Uncle/in-laws in the 90s. Take it as pure sarcasm. This conversation is one of the many reasons why her family went very low superficial contact with the inlaws. Aunt's husband (MILs other brother) refused to go completely no contact. 

Direct quote from Aunt and picture it being said in a very New York accent: 

Aunt (in a very serious voice trying to suppress her laughter) said that he must uh been so scared that young lesbians are stronger and more powerful than the regular ones --- he must uh thunk that they were gonna wrap him and his precious family up in flannel, take um to Home Depot and teach um how to build sometin, not for nuthin, that's how they get youz, youz know? And before youz know it, youz ""THE GAY"" (I told her about this post and sent her a link.) 

Aunt (also married into this hot mess) is a quick witted hoot and has been living with this stupidity for way longer than I have --- she gets it!

Love you Auntie 🩷. you're now on ""The Reddit""

Aunt has promised a full report if she hears anything. She couldn't stop laughing over, ""the lesbians are coming, the lesbians are coming""  --- she said: I betz they are!

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/jwDDQ1EgcS): **August 5, 2025 (two days later)**

**The NYC Aunt chronicles** 

**Favorite NYC Aunt got the scoop:** Favorite NYC Aunt is married to one of MILs brothers (her husband has medical issues and requires extra care, so NYC Aunt facilitates contact for her husband with the in-law clan when it's necessary and relays information to her husband when requested)

Rich Uncle's wife called to ""give NYC Aunt and her family the news"" 

***To be clear, I didn't speak to anyone except NYC Aunt and I'm just relaying the information she was given along with my brain fart commentary***

Rich Uncle landed in the hospital on Saturday (late) night, following the ""dorm shower"" and is still admitted as of Tuesday mid morning. Rich Uncle's wife said that her husband had a ""stroke"" and he's doing very bad. They just wanted NYC Aunt and her husband to know and to ""pray for them"". Rich Uncle's son (a lawyer who works for his dad's company) said his father had a ""medical episode"" with severe dehydration, high blood pressure, and some issue with his insulin.

***I wonder if shade from the blazing sun, food, water and no lesbians coming would have helped with that?*** 

***A mystery I shall ponder till the end of my days***

**What we didn't know:** According to rich Uncle's wife ((who likes to gossip and apparently really LOATHES my MIL & SIL (who knew), but played nice because of her husband)) said... Rich Uncle paid for/gave/loaned SIL $500,000 USD  to buy a townhouse near where niece was going to go to college (NYC Aunt is unsure of the specifics and wanted to play it cool without asking too many questions). Rich Uncle's wife said that SIL needed money for extensive renovations and MIL put the screws on rich Uncle for more money. Rich Uncle refused to give anything more and that prompted MIL/SIL to try and extract money from other relatives for ""dorm fees""

NYC Aunt confirmed to rich Uncle's wife that they (MIL/SIL) had asked her for $100,000 for dorm fees and she (NYC Aunt) said no, absolutely not!  Rich Uncle's wife said that NYC Aunt was smart and she should save her money 👍

The money they were trying to get out of my husband and NYC Aunt was **SUPPOSEDLY** going to go towards renovations and turning the basement of the townhouse into a built-in bunk (dormitory type) big bedroom with 2 extra bathrooms and a center lounge for the rest of SIL's kids (for when they visit Niece every weekend). Rich Uncle's wife said that they (MIL/SIL) were just wasting other people's money.

***EXACTLY!.... Why is that ANYBODY else's responsibility to fix-up Niece's/SIL's house? Your house, your kids, your responsibility.*** 

MIL was supposed to stay with niece ""to get her settled in"", in the beginning and rich uncle's wife ""thinks"" they closed on the townhouse in late June or early July.

***Exactly what niece was hoping for I'm sure --- a deranged, geriatric, permanently surprised roommate and a house full of her siblings***

***Really sets the mood*** 😏

**Rich Uncle's wife then goes on to give her version of the ""dorm shower"":** Rich Uncle and his family weren't planning on going to the ""dorm shower"" but for whatever reason MIL told rich Uncle and his wife that the ""dorm shower"" was actually a cover for a ""surprise party"" meant to honor rich Uncle. So everyone had to ""act"" like they were there for the ""dorm shower"" and then the big reveal was that everyone was really there to honor rich Uncle and all that he does for the clan, that's probably why so many other (further away living) members of the clan came in for the ""dorm shower"" 

***So... to recap, they're obligating everyone to show up with EXPENSIVE registry presents for niece but really the party is for rich Uncle*** 

***MAKES PERFECT LOGICAL SENSE AND THE GENIUS CONTINUES***

Rich Uncle's wife said that she and her family drove over 5 hrs to get to the party (I guess they took the long way --- the trip should only have taken about 3 hours). They pull up to the forest preserve and thought that the fancy tent and food set-up was for his ""surprise party""

They were pleased ... Until they weren't 🤣. When they figured out that it wasn't for him and they saw the ""dorm shower"" set-up, rich Uncle and his family were FUMING at the disrespect 😡🤬 ESPECIALLY when they can look over and see how classy the other party was and what MIL/SIL could have done if they put forth ANY effort. They waited for the speeches to see if he would be ""honored"" then, but he definitely wasn't!

According to rich Uncle's wife, they didn't even mention him or even thank him for making the ""house purchase"" possible. 

***NGL, that would piss ANYBODY off.***

Rich Uncle's wife then said that niece gave a speech and Niece said she is ""one of those"" and that goes against the will of God and she WILL be punished.

***I didn't realize that God outsourced the judgement position. I wonder if he found the inlaws on LinkedIn or did he post on Indeed? The benefit package and perks must be out-of-this-world! These are the questions and thoughts that keep me up at night!***

Rich Uncle's wife is also very, very upset!  Apparently, in their haste to leave the ""dorm shower"" and warn the world that the lesbians were coming, rich Uncle's wife said that they (accidentally) took the wrong gifts back when they were leaving and what they took was ""garbage""! 

***So, in essence, they robbed the ""dorm shower"", I can't even with these people - and they stole stuff they can't even return. Even when they're trying to make a ""statement"" they manage to fuck it up - idiots on EVERY level***

NYC Aunt had to pretend that her husband was calling her in order to get off the phone and laugh her ass off at their stupidity. NYC Aunt said she'll call her back later to see how rich Uncle is doing.

NYC AUNT thinks that rich Uncle's tantrum (from the last post) was ALL the shit hitting the fan at once with the end result being that rich Uncle ended up in the hospital.

**And the cat plays with the mouse**

***NYC Aunt called Rich Uncle's son (who was at the hospital with his dad) to express ""concern"" and offer support  if they need it*** 

(According to NYC AUNT, rich Uncle's son is a very - I'm better and smarter than you type person.) 

He said that his dad will be ""fine"" but needs to be ""watched"" so as not to have any more issues. Rich Uncle's son will be ""running things"" at the company for the foreseeable future. NYC Aunt casually mentioned that she spoke to his mom and his mom mentioned the ""dorm shower"" and what MIL and SIL did. NYC Aunt said she was so sorry that they were put through all that and his dad ended up in the hospital as a result. NYC Aunt said she could only imagine how incredibly embarrassing and disrespectful everything must have felt! NYC Aunt told him that she understands how horrible they (my MIL and SIL) are. And after ALL the money he (rich Uncle) has given them throughout the years, it's just horrible! Tsk, tsk they're (MIL and SIL) SO ungrateful and they shouldn't bite the hand that feeds them (rich Uncle's favorite saying) 

***NYC Aunt said she purposely laid it on thick!*** 

Rich Uncle's son said that they (MIL and SIL) aren't  dealing with Rich Uncle anymore, they're going to be dealing with him and it's all going to STOP. NYC Aunt said that he (rich Uncle's son) is now the head of the family and she (NYC Aunt) has always known him to be a fair and logical man (more like a know-it-all power hungry douche bag, but she's not sharing that) and he should do whatever is best to protect his sick father and family. His poor parents shouldn't be suffering like this.

NYC Aunt said that she's ""always there for them"" if they need anything. NYC Aunt asked if rich Uncle was up to talking --- unfortunately (for us), he wasn't because he was eating breakfast  

***Thank you Auntie*** 🩷.

TLDR: NYC Aunt was able to fill in some blanks in terms of the ""dorm shower"" and showed her ""support"" to the assholes so they feel comfortable and supported talking to her. Thankfully, rich Uncle has never given NYC Aunt any type of money or help --- so, they have nothing to hold over NYC Aunt and her family

**Relevant Comment**

**OOP on if she has met her husband's family prior to going NC**

> **OOP:** I have only met uncle a handful of times --- he was an asshole and his wife was very cliquey with the woman in the family and I'm a different culture so they excluded me from the jump.
> 
> My husband didn't grow up with them because Uncle and family were jet setting around the world building his business.
> 
> My husband tolerates his uncle and can't stand his cousin.
> 
> We didn't ""kiss the ring"" and we didn't want anything from them so they kept it cool/rude to hostile.
> 
> He has no real reason to not go scorched earth, given what they did --- and from what I hear he's given them millions.
> 
> What MIL/SIL pulled with the party was a slap in the face. There's no excusing the lack of effort. There's no excusing or explaining or even spinning what went down.
> 
> Auntie thinks that the fallout will be very bad.

[Update #4](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/IJlcAwSdfd): **August 7, 2025**

**NYC Aunt chronicles part 2**

***This post will not make sense without the context of the other (very long) posts. Just an FYI to not waste anyone's time***

**Apparently, my Mother-in-law is cruising for a bruisin that NYC Aunt is going to happily supply**

***Background:*** MIL is an entitled, narcissistic, mooching grifter. She along with FIL and the rest of their children (aside from my husband) have this idea that the world MUST cater to them and bend to them because they so demand it.

MIL was ""the baby"" in her wealthy family and she definitely shows it! She has wealthy older brothers who spoiled her (they continued to be very  generous with her into their adult years, even more so than my father in-law ever was or could even dream to be) and she knows that if she provides enough pressure, she'll end up getting whatever she's requesting.

Example: If MIL's brothers were to buy jewelry for their wives or daughters --- Mil would pitch a passive aggressive fit until she and SIL were given comparable.

I'm low-key surprised her brothers wives haven't murdered her with all her requests, demands, and stupidity throughout the years.

MIL is that level of demanding and annoying.

MILs brother (AKA rich Uncle) paid for a high-end kitchen remodel for MIL because my incompetent idiotic BIL doesn't have the common sense that God gave a goat. 

My husband's brother (30s at the time and living at home) thought that because he watched a few HGTV shows that he was HANDY ANDY and he would totally know how to do a gut ""to the studs"" remodel on MIL's kitchen. 

***I mean, who wouldn't be an expert after a couple of shows? I hear that the training and book learnin is nothing but a scam anyways --- it's all about the ""on-the-job"" training. To his credit though --- they were the hour long episodes, so that made him a super duper expert!*** 

So the idiot, in the middle of winter, started tearing out walls and beams ""guessing"" at what was load bearing causing the roof to shift in several areas. Let's not even mention the electrical fire. Long story short --- he got tiiiiiiired (poor wittle 30 year old baby) and couldn't go on. 

So his mommy whined to her rich brother and 3 months later she has a new roof, vaulted ceilings, a showroom kitchen, and high-end appliances. I had to actually give her a tutorial on how to use her fancy new professional quality stove because she's not much of a cook and couldn't figure out all the knobs and doohickeys.  

All that to say, MIL is used to getting what she wants and all she has to do to get it, is whine and apply enough pressure.

***So a bunch of things happened that brings us to now:*** Thursday early afternoon I get a phone call from NYC Aunt and she says: YO (my name), Immaz gonna needz youz to get this down. Getz some paper I'll waitz. (She's very New York, lovingly direct, and I adore her.)

(NYC Aunt is married to one MIL's brothers. NYC Aunt's husband has medical issues that have led to NYC Aunt having complete LEGAL control over her husband's health and his finances.)

((MIL was made aware of that (first post) when she attempted to extract $100,000 from her brother (via NYC Aunt) for ""dorm fees"" and she was promptly DENIED.))

Thursday morning NYC Aunt gets a call from MIL. Hmmm 🤔... (Aunt thinks) THIS WILL BE INTERESTING and grabs her tablet and hits record and then picks up the call.

***People, she recorded and played me the whole fucking conversation! I heard EVERYTHING!*** 

First off, MIL's voice still makes my nerves tighten and the hair on my arms and the back of my neck stand-up, I CAN NOT STAND THAT BITCH!

***SORRY, back to the conversation:*** Typically, Aunt will say hello and MIL will say, I want to talk to (her brothers name). No niceties, chitchat, or common courtesy. MIL's MO is to be cold and dismissive. Like you don't have value to her and therefore are unworthy. I've been on the receiving end of her attitude on more than one occasion in the past and know it well. MIL is being suspiciously nice and using her baby voice.  (**A** -- grow the fuck up because you ain't fooling ANYBODY and **B** -- WTF is wrong with you, were you dropped on your head as a child? Act normal, it's not that fucking hard!)  

Alarm bells are going off in NYC Aunt's head and clearly MIL is fishing for something --- Aunt just doesn't know for what! MIL is inquiring about NYC Aunt's children and their growing families (which she NEVER does), asking how Aunt is holding up taking care of uncle, asking how her summer is going, if they got Niece's invitation to the dorm shower?  (and there it is). NYC Aunt keeps it cool, said fine, fine to all the questions, and then asked how the ""dorm shower"" went? 

MIL said how WONDERFUL it was and how much NYC Aunt and her family were missed. She went on to describe how the weather couldn't have been more perfect. Everyone and everything was perfect! 

***Ummm.. I guess we have VERY DIFFERENT ideas about what constitutes something to be classified as ""perfect"", because my friend who was actually there said,  that there was no real food, no coverage from the blazing sun, no place to sit, no place to piss --- but plenty of booze (hydration is important --- especially for the teens) and a place to collect presents. So... your word of ""perfect"" is MASSIVELY misleading there princess***

She then went on to say that Niece and her friends put on a play for everyone and how talented niece and her friends are 😳🧐👌🖕

***What in the fuckity fuck?! Niece's HUGE life announcement and the introduction of her partner were a ""play"" that they put on for entertainment?! Bitch, are you fucking serious*** 

***How disrespectful, dismissive, delusional, insanely psychotic --- I'm running out of adjectives here --- WHAT IN THE THE ACTUAL FUCKING HELL is she trying to sell?*** 

***That bitch is insane and needs to be throttled --- there's no other way! UN FUCKING BELIEVABLE! Ridiculous on EVERY level.***

Aunt said, Oh really?! How was the play? I bet everyone LOVED it. Who showed up from the family? MIL ignored the question about how the play went, but said sooooo many people showed up and MIL preceded to name them ALL off (yup, Auntie really needed to know that your hairdresser who she's never met, and BTW should be fired given how you look, attended). 

Then she said how generous EVERYONE was towards niece (Rich Uncle's wife admitted to jacking a bunch of gifts, so not as generous as it COULD have been, you stupid idiot). Then MIL casually drops in the fact that they haven't received NYC Aunt and Uncle's gift yet. NYC Aunt said that's to be expected, because **Aunt** didn't send anything. (Wait for it, wait for it)

MIL in her surprised accusatory voice said: WHY NOT, you were invited?

(And here it is) 

Aunt (in the calmest, most even and basic, no accent, voice I've ever heard her use -- she's usually very animated when she talks) said: (MIL's name) remind me what you sent  ***MY CHILDREN***  when they were going off to university? How about when they graduated? How about when they got married? Or when they had their children? (Then she just waited for what felt like FOREVER until MIL spoke, I thought that we got disconnected, that's how long she waited)

MIL (in her normal bitch voice) said, can I talk to my brother? Aunt said he's not available but I'll tell him you called. Oh, and BTW....

How is your brother (rich Uncle) doing? I heard he landed in the hospital and his son was going to be taking over the business. 

**A parade of fuck you**

***That's right bitch, NYC Aunt knows ALL about what went down. She not only fucking played you, she ALSO very much put you in your place!***

MIL disconnected the call. It took me a minute to process!  Holy moly! I was laughing and screaming at the NERVE of my idiot MIL!

I had to have Auntie replay the whole conversation because I forgot that I was supposed to be writing it down. Thank you Auntie 🩷.

Had Covid (for the 3rd time) about 4 months ago and since then, sort of had stereotypical post viral lingering symptoms, without actually being sick (i.e. weakness, chills etc.), perhaps typical of the ‘long Covid’ prognosis. I played futsal a bit under a month ago and I seem to have overexerted myself (one of my triggers for a Migraine) as I have had a migraine since then, sadly though, it has not broken. Normally, my migraines in the past have broken after about a week, so this is new territory for me. 

My neurologist prescribed prednisolone for 5 days to break up the migraine, however sadly it has not worked (finished last day 9 days ago). He suggested taking more to break it up, but I am skeptical of whether it will help or jot since it did not the first time around. 

Triptan meds are off the table due to the Serotonin of it all. 

I’ve been managing and basically functional (working, sleeping, socialising ) via Panadol, coffee, eating regularly etc. but it’s a bit difficult for me at the moment because of the pain. Main neurological symptoms are sensitivity to sound, light and mild nausea (occasionally)

I'm building a simple, brand-facing website for my girlfriend of 2 years who's a content creator. She's gaining traction, but her linktree will only do so much/get her so far. This is her birthday present that she doesn't know I'm working on. It's hard to get her something that she can't get herself through an email, so I'm improvising. I've always had an interest in building websites, so I figured I'd take a crack at it. 

I'm looking for someone that's experienced to answer my stupid questions. I just started my Framer journey, and I've been watching videos to learn more. I've been relying on GPT o3 (now 5) to help, but honestly it's a bit of a let down. I gave it 20+ transcripts of youtube videos to pull from, to not much avail. Mind you, 99% of my questions are rudimentary. Majority of people here could answer in a heartbeat, but if someone feels like doing some charity work and helping a brother out, I'd appreciate it more than you'd know.

For more context and a glimpse of what I'm talking about, see the attached image. The desktop and tablet breakpoints are fine, but the phone breakpoint is flawed. The conclusion I've come to is to ultimately do what's in the sh\*tty sketch. How do I do it? No clue whatsoever. I feel like I've tried everything and I'm spinning my wheels, but I know one of you guys can do it in the blink of an eye.

Anyways, if you're interested in lending a helping hand, feel free to PM me. I truly would appreciate any help I could get. Thank you Framer Fam.

1mppxgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowingCoffee/comments/1mppxgb/m/,M,"Hey all,

I’m coordinating my first shipment of green coffee from a farm in Colombia to a roaster in the U.S., and I’d love advice from anyone who’s done this before.

The setup:
	•	Buyer is a U.S.-based coffee shop and roaster.
	•	First time importing coffee — they’re concerned about the shipment being held or seized at customs.
	•	The farm connected us with a freight forwarder in Colombia who came recommended.
	•	We’ve been quoted DDP (Delivered Duty Paid), and the forwarder says all costs and clearance are included.
	•	Exporter will handle Colombian paperwork (commercial invoice, packing list, export declaration).
	•	We do not have a U.S.-based customs broker lined up.

Questions I’m trying to get clarity on:
	1.	Even with a DDP shipment, does the U.S. buyer need any specific license, registration, or some kind of importer documentation to receive green coffee?
	2.	Will a Colombian forwarder’s DDP arrangement fully cover FDA prior notice, customs bond, and CBP entry on the U.S. side?
	3. Have you seen DDP coffee shipments still get delayed or seized? If so, why?
	4. For first-timers, what’s the biggest “gotcha” to watch for in green coffee imports?

We just want to make sure nothing slips through the cracks before we ship. Any tips, checklists, or broker recommendations would be hugely appreciated.

Thanks!

[[Explore Top Rated black and gold hello kitty stanley on Amazon.]](https://site.animetalent.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=black and gold hello kitty stanley)

## Key Features Analysis

The 2025 Black and Gold hello Kitty‍ Stanley builds upon‌ the already extraordinary⁢ foundation of the classic Stanley Quencher, incorporating unique design‌ elements.**Stainless Steel Construction**

The core of the Stanley's appeal lies in its⁢ high-quality ​18/8 stainless steel construction. This material choice ensures that‌ the bottle is incredibly durable, resistant ​to rust and corrosion, and free from harmful chemicals like BPA. Stainless steel also contributes to the bottle's ability to ⁤maintain the temperature of its contents for extended periods, whether it's icy cold water or a steaming hot beverage. The rugged construction ensures it can withstand daily wear and tear, making it a reliable ‍companion for any adventure.

**Vacuum Insulation Technology**

Stanley's vacuum insulation technology is a ‍hallmark of the brand, and ‍it's prominently featured in this hello ⁤Kitty⁢ edition. This⁢ technology creates a vacuum between the inner and outer walls of the bottle, effectively minimizing heat⁤ transfer. As a‌ result, the Stanley can keep drinks ​cold for up ⁤to 40 hours and hot for up to 7 hours. This makes it ideal for long days at work, outdoor activities, or simply keeping your favorite beverages at the perfect temperature throughout ⁢the day.

**Signature quencher Design with ‍handle**

The Black and Gold Hello ⁢Kitty Stanley retains​ the​ classic Quencher design that has ⁢made‌ the Stanley tumbler‌ so popular.

The tapered design ⁤ensures the bottle stays secure⁤ in your vehicle,preventing spills and accidents.

**Flowstate Lid ⁤Functionality**

The Flowstate lid is an innovative feature that offers multiple drinking options.‍ Users can choose between a straw opening, a wide-mouth ‍opening, or a fully ⁣closed position to prevent leaks. ‍The straw opening ​is perfect for⁤ sipping on cold beverages throughout the day, while the wide-mouth opening allows for quick gulps. The leak-proof closure ensures‌ that you can confidently carry‍ the bottle in ‍your bag without worrying about spills. The versatility of the lid adds to the overall convenience and usability ⁣of the Stanley.

**Exclusive Black and⁣ Gold Hello Kitty Design**

The most defining feature of this edition is, of course, the⁣ exclusive Black ⁣and Gold Hello ​Kitty design. The sleek black finish ⁢provides‌ a sophisticated backdrop for ⁢the gold Hello Kitty accents, creating ‌a stylish and eye-catching​ aesthetic. The⁣ design⁢ typically includes Hello Kitty's signature bow and iconic silhouette, adding a‍ touch of whimsy to the rugged stanley design. The combination of black and gold⁤ gives the bottle a premium look, making‌ it a desirable item for collectors and Hello Kitty fans alike. The design is usually applied with high-quality printing techniques to ensure long-lasting ⁣vibrancy and prevent fading or peeling.

The vacuum ⁣insulation technology ‍ensures that your⁣ beverages stay at⁢ the‍ desired temperature ⁤for hours on end.Whether you're sipping on ⁣ice water in the summer or enjoying a ‌hot cup of coffee in⁢ the winter, the Stanley keeps your⁢ drinks at the perfect temperature for maximum enjoyment.

## faqs Section

**Is the⁢ Black and Gold‍ Hello Kitty Stanley dishwasher safe?**
Yes, the Black and Gold Hello Kitty Stanley is generally dishwasher safe, ​although it's recommended to place it on the top rack to protect⁤ the‌ finish.

**What is ⁤the capacity of the Black and Gold Hello ‌Kitty Stanley?**
The capacity of the Black and Gold Hello Kitty stanley ⁣typically mirrors the popular Stanley Quencher ⁣size, which is around 40 ounces. This size strikes a good balance between portability and ⁢capacity, making it suitable for⁣ a variety​ of activities.Be sure to verify with the product description from⁤ where you buy it.

**Is the⁢ Black and ⁣gold Hello Kitty Stanley leak-proof?**
The Stanley features a Flowstate lid designed⁢ to minimize leaks.While‌ not entirely‍ leak-proof in all situations⁤ (such as being turned upside down when open),it offers a significant betterment over customary water bottle designs. The tight seal on the lid helps prevent spills and leaks during normal use, making it a reliable ⁤choice for carrying in bags⁣ or vehicles.

A few days ago I saw a very attractive women walking along the boulevard, I decided to approach her and told her what I thought: that she was pretty. Of course in derija, she thanked me and I asked her afterwards for her Instagram. We talked and exchanged info, I told her I'm on holidays here and that I wanted to go on a date with her. We agreed up on a time and got s coffee and ice tea. Afterwards I asked her if it was okay if I hugged her goodbye. She seemed very shocked and reserved and said no. After our second date, we talked much longer and got to know eachother better despite my bad derija. I got a her s flower too, she told be if I got her a flower that I would get a hug. She gave me a very light hug after the date and she told me I shouldn't use my own hands to hug her (so basically just stand still like a robot). Maybe I should not not that she is top heavy. 

I was attracted to her and I liked her, in the heat of the moment I told her that I would love to hug her tighter. She kept mentioning that she is super aware of our surroundings (we were standing in her neighbourhood and felt watched by everyone outside). I really that honestly, there is much more communal ""supervision"", and everyone seems to gossip about everyone here. I also told her that, before leaving to Europe, that I would love to kiss her. She said she was going to think about it and we would meet tomorrow. 

After that I thanked her on Instagram and told her again how attractive I thought she was. She said the same about me. Two hours later I saw that she completely deactivated her Instagram account and I can't message her anymore.

I feel so stupid and also upset about this. I feel like things that are more normal in Europe are just not the norms in Morocco. And that I was totally oblivious of her situation. I don't know who saw us together on the streetand how much it would impact her in a negative way. How far I went and that I probably already crossed many lines of her. 

Can someone give their perspective and analyses of this situation? I really want to do better and learn. I feel so stupid. If you have additional questions also just ask. Thank you so much. ",2,1755143210.0,Morocco,4,1.0,False

I've been doing okay. I've had to be present for our 4 year old after all. In all actuality, I've been feeling better and better. Yet today happened. The crushing, unbearable guilt and anxiety of being the ""survivor."" It comes in, nameless and unidentifiable sometimes. No idea why it feels like my heart is being squeezed like an orange for fresh, delicious juice. Why I feel like a lecherous asshole for being upset my physical and emotional needs aren't being met and I really have no hope of addressing the former for probably a very long time, and I'm having trouble knowing how to get help for the latter. Maybe it was because last night my kid, who gets older and smarter every day, asked what God does to people who die. And when I told him, He said he would wait for Mommy.

I've been lucky. My family is supportive, and now lives nearby since we had to move back. I've got one or two close friends. I even met some people here that have a similar story and have even been gracious enough to give me a place to open up, if maybe just a little too much. I overshare my life a lot, haha.

But spending 90% of today screaming at the walls and pacing the house while my little guy was in daycare? Not how I wanted to spend it. Neglecting my job search because I'm fighting demons and tilting at windmills? Not ideal.

In a way, I'm sitting here typing this as a way of screaming into the void. But the truth is, I think I'm finally remembering how to take a chance and reach out after years of isolation and emotional/psychological abuse. I wanna be OK. I know that I'm not. But I feel like I'm gonna be.

I still loved her. Miss the sound of her breathing, as we laid in the dark side by side. I really miss making her a cup of coffee every morning on the Keurig, even though I can't stand the stuff. French Roast. Black. Tiny girl drank rocket fuel every morning. Fuck.

Wednesday night at the kitchen table was pure comfort: coffee rings on the cutting board, craft paints everywhere, and our little one orbiting the action like a happy satellite. Gabby jumped back into the Medieval Cottage she started earlier this month and wrapped up the last big blocks of color while I drafted posts for Gator Social.

# What we worked on

* **Walls & beams:** She finished the limewash on the wall panels—soft white glazed with warm tan—and picked out the timbers in a light natural brown to sharpen the half-timber look.
* **Wattle fencing:** Layered drybrush sequence—**English Mustard** base → a light pass of **Metallic Red** → **Mud Brown + Metallic Red** to land a weathered reed tone.
* **Thatched roof & lean-to:** **Nutmeg + Golden Brown** for depth, then a whisper of ivory on the ridges to keep the straw feel.

# Why this session felt good

Terrain has the best payoff curve—you see progress fast. Big surfaces, forgiving textures, and plenty of room for drybrushing and stippling. Our daughter loved the “pretty paints,” asked a hundred questions, and proudly claimed the tiny gate as *hers*. It’s never too early to hand them a safe brush and a spare fence panel.

# Paint notes (for fellow hobbyists)

* **Half-timber walls:** off-white/ivory → thin tan glaze to age → light ivory edge drybrush.
* **Timbers:** light wood brown → subtle grey-green aging glaze.
* **Wattle fences:** English Mustard → light Metallic Red filter → Mud Brown + Metallic Red. *(We’re testing how metallics behave under a later drybrush—update coming.)*
* **Thatch:** Nutmeg + Golden Brown → very gentle ivory drybrush on the high points.

We’re about **two-thirds finished**. Next up: targeted weathering and grime, a little pigment around doors and posts, and basing with texture, tufts, and weeds for that “lived-in” feel.

F*****g do it then, easier said than done right? Yeah it is, but the only way you can get to where you wanna be is if you put the effort in, I know this from personal experience of going from 92kg to 58kg in 2 months from a 5/700 calorie deficit and hard workouts (and I’m not talking lifting weights, I went to the local gym ONCE A WEEK on a guest pass to run as much and as hard as possible between speed walking and the odd casual jog and the other days of the week I worked out at home either doing 3 sets of as many pushups, burpees (these hit so good), leg raises (hell yes), mountain climbers and V sits as I could. If you don’t believe me, I have picture proof, I was so obese I looked like a fat Asian kid, then I had a 6 pack.)

What’d I eat? No breakfast, just coffee (mocha obvs, not personally a coffee fan but it grew on me) to burn those calories and start the mind in the morning. Lunch: Ham (or any meat) Sandwich/1 sausage roll/small meat and potato pie. Dinner: Red pesto pasta and a cup of tea with the odd biscuit for supper. (WHICH IS NOT A LOT OF CALS AT ALL BTW BUT LEFT ME FEELING FUELLED FOR THE FULL DAY) Did I have takeouts, yes! My dad loved getting us both one. But.. I also ate in proportion to maintain my calories and sometimes that meant I could split that delicious takeout up into multiple days worth of food. I counted my calories (I personally ate 1200ish cals but I know it’s different for everyone) I didn’t have no bs fitness advice, I ate relatively well with the odd “cheat day” (that being the segmented takeouts) 

What good is all this advice, you either take it and go change your life or you keep scrolling, I just hope this helps or inspires somebody even if it’s just you, to take control. I love you all. ❤️

And no, I didn't get hired for the job like most rangers do, I sort of... inherited it from my uncle, the crazy old coot. Still, nothing quite explains my job than telling the story of my first week on it. Here is my story.



\---------------------------------------------------- 

My cousin, Amy, someone who I hadn't spoken to in maybe three years, just showed up at my apartment in Chicago the day after I turned twenty-six. I remember opening the door that late rainy September evening, not even recognizing her at first. She had a haggard and worn-out expression, as if she'd been crying on the way over and hadn't had a minute of sleep. Where before she was just slim, now she looked bone thin, almost malnourished. Red hair like her mother's that used to be so vibrant and full, now looked stringy and uncared for. Behind Amy, I could see her husband Dan standing across the street, leaning next to their car, barely illuminated by the weak street lamps. They must've driven all day. He had a completely deadpanned expression; I couldn't read him. He just sort of stared out onto the street in front of him, not really there, not really present in the moment.

I returned my attention to Amy. I was so surprised and sort of weirded out by the situation that I forgot to invite them both in, or asked why they were here, or react in any real way. We all sort of just stood there, trapped in the moment. Amy was the first one to recover, she took in a deep breath then said ""James. I'm so sorry. But..."" It was then I noticed that she had a couple items clutched in her narrow arms. One was a manila envelope and other was a box that was over three feet long. She half dropped half shoved them into my arms, as I tried to come up with some sort of reply. ""Dad's dead."" she continued in a halting, pained voice. ""He left...He left these for you. You're the only one who’s supposed to open them. He said they were important."" Then she turned around and ran back to the car. As they were climbing back into the car, she called out, ""Don't be late! He said you can't be late!"" Then flashed me an expression that so full of pain and regret that it floored me. While I didn't always get along with my uncle, she loved her dad fiercely. Without another word, she closed the door and I watched them drive off.

I must've stood there for a couple of minutes, just trying to process what I just experienced. Frowning deeply, I shook my head and went back inside, putting the items down on the dinner table. I couldn't shake the cold feeling that was snaking its way down my spine as I looked at them.

My family... has always been weird. My Dad worked exactly three days a week at some government office he couldn't talk about, and Mom would lock herself in the basement for a couple nights a month where she'd scream for hours. One day when I was 11, my dad sent me off to boarding school, and by the end of that summer both my parents had died from a car accident. Mom's brother took me in... Well, it was more like his wife and kid took me in, Uncle Ray was gone for a small chunk of the year and every time he was home, he barely spoke to me. Though whenever he did pay any attention to me at home, a haunted expression would sometimes flash across his face. I thought he was in the military or something, deployed to a base for half a year, but it turned out he was a park ranger. 

My cousin, Amy, was my only friend, but we drifted apart over the years as my uncle became more and more withdrawn. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore, I couldn't take my uncle's guilty silence, the odd looks I'd get from my aunt when she thought I wasn't looking, and the distance that I knew Amy was putting between her and me. I couldn't take it, so I up and joined the army when I turned 18.

I lost myself in my duty for my country and fighting the good fight overseas, and watching a few of my friends die in front of me. Still, I couldn't shake this strange feeling that time was running out, that I was supposed to be somewhere, waiting for something. I moved around after I got out of the service. Moving from odd job to odd job trying to make ends-meet. Finally, last year, I landed a steady low-paying job as security guard in Chicago. 

Now, after all this time, Amy shows up out of the blue, saying that Uncle Ray had left a few things for me before he died even though he didn't speak ten words to me in the years I lived with them. I stared at the items; the envelope and the long rectangular box. The box had been heavy, like it had some kind of metal weight inside. I think knew what was in it. The rifle. My mind zipped back to all those autumns when Uncle Ray would prepare to go back to the park service and he'd sling some kind of old-fashioned rifle on his back. I leaned over and finally opened the box.

Sure enough, I was right. An old lever-action rifle; my Uncle's old rifle, exquisitely made and maintained. Absolutely beautiful, but also eerie. A darkwood stock, a long black iron barrel, with strange etchings on the side. Looking at the etchings on the barrel kind of made my head hurt, it was like I couldn't focus on them for too long. That in and of itself sent another cold chill down my spine. Lifting it up, I noticed the empty cartridge belt underneath, meant to hold forty-five more rounds. I didn't know much about old guns, but a friend of mine in the army was a big wild west buff, he'd talk my ear off about them all the time. My eyes roamed the weapon, and noticed the words roughly scrolled on the side of the stock; ""All souls hold"", as if scratched in desperation.

I got out my phone and looked up a few things about the lever-action rifles and shotguns, giving the venerable weapon a thorough checking. I found out that this was probably some kind of customized Winchester Model 1886, fully loaded with nine 45-70 Government rounds. I chuckled darkly at the fact that Amy just shoved a loaded gun into my hands like a forgotten birthday gift. I shook my head again. I began unloading all eight rounds from the tubular magazine and ejecting the one in the chamber, making sure it was completely empty before putting it back down.

Next, I picked up the envelope. It was surprisingly heavy. Inside, I found two sheets of paper with writing on them and five large silver coins. One of the sheets was obviously written by my uncle, his crisp handwriting precise but apparently hurried. The other, looked older. Yellowed with age, the paper had frayed and torn edges, wrinkles from rough handling, and what appeared to be dark stains on one corner that I didn't want to think about too much. The words on the old paper seemed to have been written on an old typewriter, it said this:

 

**TEN RULES FOR THE RANGER ON WATCH**

**1)         Before entering the watch tower on your first day, walk a circle around its base counter clockwise five times, while loudly chanting the words, ""I am the ranger, land and air. I am the ranger, river and bear. I am the ranger, away with you. I am the ranger, until I'm through."" Finish the chant even when you end up circling a sixth time.**

**2)         After entering, throw a handful of salt behind you, do not turn around even if you hear voices outside, then lock the door and hang an iron horseshoe on the door handle.**

**3)         Each time you climb the stairway to the top of the tower, you must count out loud the number of steps. There must be 45 steps and three landings, with the final one having the door to the lookout. If the number is different when you reach the top, sprinkle salt on the last landing and touch a silver coin to the door handle before opening the door to the lookout.**

**4)         Each time you exit and re-enter the lookout, please verify if any of following items are present:**

o  **An old two-way radio;**

o  **A wooden chair;**

o  **One to three crudely carved wooden dolls;**

o  **A plate of fresh food;**

o  **An aged leatherbound book;**

o  **A coil of old rope;**

o  **A vase filled with flowers,**

o  **An obsidian stone knife, and;**

o  **A bottle of dark wine;**

**None of these items are supposed to be in the room, touch them only with the gloves from your pack and immediately toss all these off the lookout terrace.**

**5)         Every Monday at 6am, check the glass jars containing salt in the corners of the lookout. If they have lessened in quantity, add more. If they have darkened, dump the darkened salt out on the terrace and pour in new salt.**

**6)       After checking the salt jars, dial the number on the satellite phone, wait for it to connect, then speak the following phrase: ""Four Echo Nine Two, the Pass is closed and I am Charlie on Halo. Five Ten Five."" Do not wait for a reply, simply hang up afterwards.**

**7)         You may only leave the Watch Tower from 10am to 2pm and must patrol the path as indicated in the map provided to you as quickly as possible.**

**8)         Check each of the five totems. If one or more of the totems have been disturbed or destroyed, return to the watch tower immediately and call the number on the satellite phone. Begin by saying this phrase: ""I know Six has seen Eight Thirteen and Two are there."" Wait for the confirmation then proceed to report what you saw.**

**9)         If you come upon a lost person during your patrol, whether they be an adult or child, ask them what day it is? If they do not provide you with the correct answer, drop an iron nail before you and immediately run back to the watch tower. If they provide you with the correct day, give them one of your iron nails, then direct them east to the closest Ranger Station. Do not follow them, do not offer to guide them out, even if they appear desperate and insistent.**

**10)      If the birds or surrounding ambient noise go suddenly quiet, quickly take note of the area you are in and make your way directly back to watch tower. Do not run, and do not deviate from your path. Once inside, use the Satellite phone, starting the code phrase in Rule 8, and report on where the lull in sound occurred.**



The second were a crisp pieces of white bond paper written with in my uncle's chicken scratch handwriting. 

I didn’t bother opening the manila envelope just yet. The weight of the rifle in my hands, and the strange, uneasy feeling it stirred inside me, kept me from thinking about anything else. Something about the rifle felt wrong—like it had a history I couldn’t fathom, one that wanted to remain buried, and the old words scratched into the wood, “All souls hold,” gnawed at my thoughts like a bad memory I couldn’t shake. I placed the gun carefully on the kitchen table, making sure the barrel didn’t point toward me, and focused on the envelope instead.

The paper inside was thick, heavy, almost like parchment. I pulled it out, unfolded it, and read through the messy scrawl that was four pages long. It was shaky, frantic even, and the words were almost unreadable in places. I had to squint to make sense of them:

 

*“James, I don't have much time left. It’s coming. I’m so sorry. They’ll come for you next. The things in the woods—they never stop. Remember the rules. They will try to test you. Don’t let them. It’s too late for me, but I have to tell you a few things. Things the rules overlook. Things nobody is going to tell you over there even if you ask…*

*…The rules aren't foolproof. Use the rifle. It's been passed down our family for four generations. A weapon that was used to save a life and was never used take one. It's the only thing that'll hurt them. You have to carry your own ammo, since the gun isn't part of the rules. Make sure you buy plenty; specialized bullets with iron-cores…*

*…The items on Rule 4 aren't the only ones you're supposed to be looking for. Don't trust anything in the Watch Tower that isn't bolted down with iron bolts or sprinkled with salt…*

*…The five totems are essentially logs sticking out of the ground carved by Seneca shamans a long time ago. They've stood there longer than the United States has had laws, and they are very very hard to damage even with explosives, so if they've been destroyed, it's already too late. If not, replace the silver coin at the foot of each totem with one of the five in this letter. When you get back to the Tower, plunge the recovered silver coins into a jar of salt. Not in the same ones in the corners. Remember to replace the salt jars every week…*

*…Radios can be compromised, too easy to mimic, too easy to home-in on the carrier waves and hijack them. It's also the reason why you have to arrive on foot, why ground vehicles can't reach that spot, and why you can only be extracted by air. They'll screw with the engines or cut wires, puncture tires, do anything they can to stop cars from moving. Cellphones are a different issue; they don't work too well. You see, these things don't understand digital technology. Sure, they know enough to block signals and confuse our perception, but intercepting text messages or trying to screw around internet chats are beyond them. So, they just knock out nearby cell towers or generate some sort of interference. It's why you'll lose signal if they're close. Only ever use the Satellite phone. As far as anybody can tell, these thing's influence doesn’t extend to space, so the government has a satellite permanently dedicated to bounce comms off your area…*

*…Rule 9 is full of shit, if you turn your back on whatever that thing is, you're dead. There's more than one, if you turn, chances are another is gonna show up in front to distract you while the other one comes up from behind, waiting for you to flinch. Too dangerous. None of that nonsense, take the rifle and pump it full of iron-core rounds until it goes away. Iron doesn't kill them, but it does hurt them. Hurt them enough and they'll stop and reconsider messing with you, at least for a little while. Finish your patrol, don't go back to the tower until you're done…”*



The rest of the letter was a blur of more warnings, and “*I’m sorry I couldn’t be there*” that made it hurt to think about. As for the rest, I could hardly read it without feeling the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I set the letter aside, my heart pounding in my chest as my thoughts spun in a dozen directions. What the hell was this all about? Creatures? Totems? My uncle had always been strange, but this felt like something way darker.

I didn't realize how long I had been sitting there, picking up the letter then putting it down again, until the clock on the wall snapped me out of my trance. It was late, nearly midnight. I glanced over at the window; the city lights of Chicago outside were blurry through the fogged glass. I hadn't realized how much the darkness was pulling me in, the quiet pressing in on my mind, until it felt almost suffocating.

*What the hell was I going to do?* This didn’t seem like it had anything to do with me, but my Uncle named me to succeed him in this… clusterfuck of weirdness.

I looked back at the box and the rifle, half-expecting to see them somehow... different. A tremor of fear ran through me, but I couldn't explain why. I told myself it was all nonsense—just my uncle's crazy ramblings. Maybe I wasn’t as unaffected by his death as I thought.

The man wasn’t the best father-figure in any sense of the word. Heck, he was barely even there. But, he was kind to me, treated me like I was a member of the family—as loose as that was. His family took me in when I had no one, so I guess I owe him something for that.

I spent the next few hours scanning the contents of the manila envelope more carefully, finding old maps and handwritten notes. They all seemed to point to the same place: an isolated firewatch tower deep in the Appalachian Mountains. My uncle’s last known station before he disappeared during his last “stint.”

I didn’t sleep that night.

The next morning, I left the apartment with a backpack full of stuff and the old lever-action rifle firmly secured in an old leather rifle bag I found in the box, then I began to drive.

As I neared the mountains, the roads became narrower, twisting like the dark veins of the earth. My phone had no signal for miles, the trees pressing in like a wall on either side of me. I was starting to wonder if this whole thing was just a mistake—an old man's final delusions that I had somehow inherited—but something in the back of my mind told me I couldn’t ignore it. Not with Amy’s last words hanging over me.

My uncle's letter directed me to a Ranger Station deeper in the mountains. I thought back to the instructions:

*Go to the Ranger station on the map. Say the following phrase: ""Hello, I'm Frank Romeo and I was wondering if you have brochures for the Northeastern pass.""*

I understood a good ol' fashioned challenge phrase when I read it, and this one couldn't be more obvious. The question is, why would a Ranger Station need a challenge code phrase? I put the mystery from my head as I pulled my old sedan into the largely empty parking lot. It was late afternoon when I walked into the station, which sort of resembled a large two-storey log cabin. A couple hiker types were talking to a ranger over by a corner, taking casual sips of coffee. Another ranger seemed to be looking introspectively at a big map of the territory taped to a wall.

I walked up to the guy looking at the map, he noticed me approaching and gave me an easy smile.

""Hey, going hunting?"" He said, indicating the rifle and my pack. I mumbled an awkward affirmative, not sure what to do now that I was here. With no further thought on the matter, I decided to just whisper the code phase to the guy. ""Um, hey, I'm Frank Romeo and I was wondering if you have brochures for the Northeastern pass.""

The Ranger's expression slowly shifted from welcoming, to surprised, to grave. Then, he seemed to force a smile and incline his head at me to follow him. We passed the other ranger talking to the hiker couple, he gave them a brief wave and as he led me down a short hallway, and opened a backroom. It contained a simple desk and three chairs, with a bunch of cabinets. The old ranger gestured for me to take a seat as he unlocked and opened a drawer that was directly behind him.

When he turned around, he was carrying a small stack of papers. The ranger slid a eleven-page contract in front of me brimming with legalese. ""Read these, and then sign,"" he drawled, then he got up and left, closing the door behind him. I was alone in the small, dimly lit room now. I looked at the stack of papers on the desk in front of me—thick, yellowed, and filled with bureaucratic language that seemed both foreign and... urgent. Employer-employee relationship this, insurance that. I read it carefully, and it was pretty straight-forward. As I flipped through the pages, I realized none of the text made sense. Words like ""guardianship"" and ""boundaries"" appeared often, but they were jumbled in ways that made it hard to follow any logical sequence. Every page felt like a puzzle—nothing was straightforward. 

When I reached the last page, my jaw practically dropped with I saw the pay. For the price of four months being stationed out in the Appalachian wilderness alone with no contact to the outside world except a satellite phone, I would be paid 400,000 dollars. 

*A little under half-a-million bucks just to serve as a glorified fire watch ranger!* 

Almost immediately, alarm bells started going off in my head. Nobody paid this much for a job like that. No way. If I was still on the threshold about believing any of my uncle’s rabblings in the letter before, the Ranger's abrupt change in attitude and this weird contract effectively slammed that door closed. I was being played. The question was, whose game this was.

I read it more carefully. They were in an official-looking format, with a thick black stamp of approval at the top, but it wasn’t the government logo I expected. It was a symbol—a twisting knot of lines that almost looked like an eye within a diamond with two arrows crossed behind it. The air in the room felt heavier, somehow, but oddly enough, looking at the symbol actually made me breathe easier. As if it was some kind of stabilizing influence in the midst of the quiet unnamed chaos around me.

I didn’t know what to do. But since I was already here, I gingerly picked up the pen the old ranger left with the documents and signed my name four times on the blanks provided. Pausing only briefly to wonder why the ink was red instead of the more common blue or black.

Almost as if he was waiting for me to do so, the ranger walked back in just as I was putting down the pen. He was carrying a large backpack which he deposited on the desk before me as he collected the paperwork and shoved it all back into the drawer behind him. He bore a serious expression as he turned back to me: 

""Mr. Romeo, in this combo-backpack you will find the following items: a camelback filled with 2-liters of water, food stocks enough for four days, a small bag of iron horseshoes, a small bag iron nails, and a large pouch of salt. Refresh supplies get dropped in by helicopter, every week on Saturdays. You must enter the forest on foot and carry nothing more than this backpack of possessions. You may bring that rifle and ammunition with you too. You must arrive at your watch tower no later than midnight of September 30th. If you don't, you'll die.""

I frowned. That kind of gallows humor was common in the military, and the declaration was delivered so casually that I nearly smirked at the mistimed attempt at a joke. But the old ranger was looking me dead in the eyes with all the seriousness of a funeral. What the hell? After waiting an uncomfortable minute for him to let me in on the joke or even for his expression to change, I gave up and I took the pack in silence.

There was no ceremony. No handshake. The old ranger gave me a nod—half approval, half pity—and turned back toward the hallway, leaving me alone with my gear and my growing sense of dread.

“Hey!” he called as I was halfway down the hall. I turned just in time to see him toss something small and shiny into the air at me. I barely managed to catch it. When I looked down to examine what I held, my eyes widened to see a small gold-plated badge emblazoned with the bison insignia of the U.S. National Park Rangers. The badge looked old and scratched but well-polished, differing slightly from the badges all the others had. It felt a little heavy too, like it was actually made of gold.

“Welcome to the woods, Ranger.” He said with a smirk, as he turned and walked back into the office.

The sun was starting to dip behind the trees as I stepped outside the station, the mountains casting long, cold shadows over the gravel lot. I slung the pack over my shoulders, feeling the weight of it settle between my shoulder blades. Then I opened the rifle case and checked it one more time. Oddly, its presence was comforting. I slid the weapon back into its sheath, and strapped on the cartridge belt now filled with forty-five brand new iron-core rounds, with almost two hundred more in my pack.

By the time I reached the trailhead marked on the map, dusk had settled in, the dense fog swallowing the road behind me. The fire watch tower was another three hours’ hike into the woods, but something gnawed at my gut. I looked down at the trailhead where a small, rusted sign hung from an iron chain that simply read: “AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.” To assume that the chain would stop anyone from simply skipping over it was laughable, but I now suspected that the chain was to hold things in rather than to stop people from entry. Light glinted off the Ranger Badge I had pined to my jacket.

I took a deep breath.

Then I crossed the threshold.

The first four miles were uneventful. I kept myself in decent shape even after I got out of the army and I easily stepped over trails that twisted through heavy pine and birch forest, the air clean but thin with elevation. I passed a few abandoned trail markers, faded with age, and one overturned bench that had been swallowed by moss and roots. Around the fifth mile, things began to change. In some areas of the trail, the forest grew quiet, too quiet. The trees didn’t sway, no rustling underbrush or scurrying animals. It was as if the forest itself was holding its breath. I followed the path, but the further I went, the more I felt... watched.

The woods grew darker, even though the sun hadn't yet set. The trees began to grow taller, their trunks oddly smooth, barkless in places. I saw scars in the dirt—lines gouged into the trail like something had been dragged, or maybe crawled. Still, I pressed on, unconsciously picking up my pace despite already feeling a little winded. The rules were clear: arrive before midnight, or die.

I made great time and it was still dusk when I crested a hill and saw the tower loomed in the distance, standing like forgotten sentinel just a couple more miles away.

I took a few minutes to catch my breath and drink some water. That's when I noticed the woods around me were still again, and a low, uneasy hum seemed to vibrate in the air. There was a strange humming in the air—just at the edge of hearing. Like cicadas, but too steady. It was as if something was watching me—no, waiting for me. I knelt and quick unstrapped my uncle's old rifle. I had practiced loading and unloading the thing the night before, and I did so now with mechanical precision. With each round I pushed in, I felt the humming deepen, until it was all I could do to keep breathing as the vibrations almost constricted my chest.

But as soon as I loaded the nineth and last round into the rifle then racked the lever, the humming abruptly stopped. The oppressive silence was also gone. The normal sounds of a forest preparing for the coming night surrounded me. I took a couple slow breaths and then started walking again, the rifle held in low-ready.

As I neared the tower, I noticed the subtle signs of decay all around——faded etchings were carved into the bark of the trees, as if someone had tried to marked their way, like they were afraid of getting lost. It loomed above the tree line like a skeletal lighthouse, metal bones rusted but intact. That’s what I noticed the most, the damn thing was almost completely made of metal, where every online search I ran on what fire watch towers looked like revealed sturdy wooden construction. This thing more resembled a oil-rig floating on a sea of dirt, only without the drill tube in the middle.

The top room—the lookout itself—was encased in windows, catching the last light like empty eyes. A narrow spiral staircase wound around the support beams, stretching up at least four stories. It looked far taller than the 45 steps I was told to expect.

I stopped just at the edge of the clearing, the air around the tower seemed thick and humid. I felt more sweat trickle down my shirt. I slung the rifle again and pulled out the instructions.

 

**Rule 1: Walk a circle around the base five times, counterclockwise. Chant the words. Finish even if it’s six times.**

 

I still felt that this whole thing was insane, but I stepped into the clearing anyway.

Clutching a small bag of salt in one hand and the strap of the rifle in the other, I began the ritual. One circle. Two. Three. Four. By the fifth lap, I was breathless, the pack digging into my shoulders. I said the words aloud each time, with more confidence than I felt:

 

“I am the ranger, land and air.

I am the ranger, river and bear.

I am the ranger, away with you.

I am the ranger, until I'm through.”

 

On the sixth circle—because it always ended on six—I stumbled, something cold brushing against my leg like an invisible cat. I didn’t look down. I didn’t break stride.

At the end of the chant, the atmosphere changed. The heaviness in the air eased. The tower seemed somehow... clearer, even in the deepening darkness.

I climbed the stairs slowly, counting each one aloud. “One… two… three… four…”, the old metal groaning under my boots as I ascended.

At step thirty-nine, my boot hit something wet. I looked down.

A streak of red, smeared across two steps. Not fresh, but not old either.

“Forty-two… forty-three… forty-four…”

The sun was now just a red line on the horizon. The shadows around me stretched long. I reached the third landing. My hand hovered over the lookout’s iron handle. The rules said if the steps didn’t add up, sprinkle salt and use a coin. But they did add up. Still, I hesitated.

Almost as if sensing my hesitation, I heard the whispering. I felt sweat bead my brow that wasn't from the humidity. Dozens of them. Men, women, children—voices right somewhere behind me, pressing in from the darkness. I didn't turn around, I just threw half-a-handful of salt over my shoulder behind me, and the whispers seemed to fade out.

I gripped the door handle and pushed. I immediately felt the weight of the place—cold, heavy, like it had been waiting for me. The room was dark and close-quarters training kicked in from some long-forgotten corner of my mind and I quickly swung the rifle up again and brought the butt of the weapon to my shoulder.

I stepped further inside, checking the corners and angles. Only after I had assured my psyche that I was completely alone did I finally allow myself to relax. I completed my check and closed the door.

I set my gear down and turned around, through wide windows I took in the view of the endless darkening forest surrounding my new home. The air was stale, thick with the scent of wood smoke, damp pine, and something older—earthy and bitter. There was something hauntingly beautiful about the isolation. The trees stretched for miles in every direction, their skeletal branches swaying gently in the breeze. It was pretty dim, but I suspected the moon would be rising soon. I found the light switch within easy reach of the door. I knew the watch tower had solar panels on the roof and I had sufficient power to run the whole place all night.

Gingerly, I pulled out the rules and rechecked them. With the entire room now illuminated, my eyes zeroed on **Rule 4 - Each time you exit and re-enter the lookout, please verify if any of following items are present:**

**\* An old two-way radio;                                                         \* A coil of old rope;**

**\* A wooden chair;                                                                   \* A vase filled with flowers,**

**\* One to three crudely carved wooden dolls;                      \* An obsidian stone knife, and;**

**\* A plate of fresh food;                                                          \* A bottle of dark wine;**

**\* An aged leatherbound book;**

None of these items are supposed to be in the room, touch them only with the gloves from your pack and immediately toss all these off the lookout terrace.

I looked up from the page and scanned the large room. Nothing seemed to jump out as strange, then I saw them. A bowl of fruit was on the table, the items in it looked freshly picked, next to the metal table was an old wooden chair. A chill ran down my spine at seeing the two items. 

Nightfall came quickly. The forest grew darker, more oppressive. The wind picked up, causing the trees to whisper, their voices carrying on the wind. As the light faded, I felt it—a presence, moving just outside the range of my vision. It was subtle, like the rustling of leaves in the distance, but it was enough to send a chill down my spine.

I reached for my gloves.

They were deep in the front pocket of the issued backpack, rolled tightly together beside the spare salt bag and the iron nails. My hands trembled slightly as I pulled them on—not from fear, exactly, but from the overwhelming sense that I had just stepped into something ancient, something aware.

The chair creaked.

Just once.

A long, dry groan of wood shifting underweight.

I hadn’t touched it.

I froze, rifle raised again, my eyes fixed on the wooden chair beside the table. It was now angled ever so slightly toward the center of the room, like someone had just stood up from it. The bowl of fruit sat undisturbed on the table, its contents almost too perfect—bright red apples, deep purple grapes, a yellow pear without a blemish. There was no dust on them. No flies.

Swallowing hard, I stepped forward, took the bowl in both hands, and carried it carefully to the open terrace door. I dumped it over the railing without ceremony.

The fruit didn’t make a sound when it hit the ground below.

I turned and grabbed the chair next.

It was heavier than it looked, and colder. The wood was smooth and dark, with carvings along the back legs—unreadable, almost fungal-looking grooves that pulsed with damp. The moment I picked it up, the light in the room flickered. The old fluorescent tubes hanging from the ceiling buzzed with static electricity.

“Just a chair,” I muttered under my breath, more to myself than anything else.

I dumped it over the railing too.

The moment it vanished into the trees the flickering stopped. The lights steadied. The oppressive weight that had settled in my chest eased… slightly.

I took a deep breath, turned back to the room, and immediately stopped.

There was a third item.

On the cot, where I'd just tossed my pack, now sat a small leather-bound book. Old, warped by water, its cover cracked and flaking at the edges. I hadn't seen it there before—I was sure of it.

I backed toward the terrace again, slipped the gloves back on, picked up the book, and flung it as far as I could.

This time, something screeched from the forest.

A sound like metal tearing. Animalistic, guttural—but not alive. My heart slammed against my ribs. I didn't wait. I slammed the terrace door shut, threw the bolt, and backed into the center of the room.

“I did it,” I whispered aloud, forcing the words out. “I followed Rule 4.”

The silence that followed was complete.

For the rest of the night, I didn't sleep. I sat in the far corner of the tower with my back to the cold wall, the rifle across my lap, the rules in my pocket. Every hour or so, I swore I saw a shadow move outside the glass. I stood by the window of the tower, watching the forest below. I didn't see anything. The cold creeping dread that had been sitting in my stomach now began to tighten, knotting around my chest. I couldn’t help but feel something was out there.

But nothing came up.

Nothing knocked.

And eventually, the dark turned blue. Then gray. Then pale gold.

I'm a 32 year old Black woman and New York City native who loves the city, and likely will never leave. I'm looking for someone local (or someone who is planning to move here) who also loves all the city has to offer. 

About me:

Most importantly, I am an ambivert and a cat person. I love to parallel play with my loved ones on a quiet afternoon, but I also like to go out a few times a week to a nice restaurant, my local dive, or a coffee shop. 

I love live music and have been to one or two shows a month since the beginning of this year. Some of my favorite genres are indie rock, Midwest emo, and pop. 

I like to read, craft, and bake in my free time. I'm getting back into writing, too. 

About you:

A creative, funny, and also a cat person. I want someone who is empathetic and politically progressive left. I get along best with people who are quick-witted, independent thinkers, and open to learning new things. 

My usual type is tall & brown-haired, but I am open if you can make me laugh, are a great cook, or can send me good book recommendations. A nice smile doesn't hurt either.

Nice but not necessary:

-Niche hobby
-Plays an instrument
-Studied humanities
-Has tattoos

About us:

I am ideally looking for someone who is ready for a long term relationship. I am in a place in life where I have everything I need and am very happy. I love my career, my friendships, have hobbies that interest and excite me, and am content spending time alone. 

I want someone who feels the same about their life, who wants to find ways to add to each other's lives.
 
If any of that piqued your interest, I'd love to hear from you! Please send a SFW picture and a little about you and say hi :)",2,1755141956.0,r4r,1,0.75,False

DARK ROMANCE
So I decided to finally jump into writing again after years of not. I used to write fanfic and short stories when I was a teen until I had my son at 16. Im 20 now and decided why not? I love reading (although I don’t often) and always create scenarios in my head for books I wish I would write! I just finished my portfolios and I’d love to see how others feel about them! It’s giving me a sense of who they truly are, I plan to add more as I begin to write though! 


Characters.
Name: Lilienne Ivy Glass
Age: 21
Birthdate: Oct 18 2004
Gender: F

Profile Characteristics 

Personality:  Shy, Quiet, Socially awkward, paranoid, creative (artsy), romantic daydreamer, stubborn

Likes: Lilacs, rainy nights, storms, bunnies, reading, painting, soft music, punk rock music, loyalty

Dislikes: dishonesty, artificial lighting, the smell of gasoline, crowded areas, silence so deep its heavy, sudden changes with no time to prepare

Quirks/Habits: twirls a strand of hair when lost in thought/ daydreaming, avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks, keeps her tea half full for hours as she tends to get distracted easily.

Hobbies: collecting flowers/ pressing them in books, baking simple recipes, journaling, going to thrift stores/ book stores and or flea markets.

Backstory:
Lilienne grew up in a small apartment above a laundromat, the hum of machines and the scent of detergent was her constant. Her father, a mechanic with a tired smile, raised her and her three siblings alone after their mother died giving birth to the youngest. In the chaos of the city, their home was heaven. mismatched mugs on the table, the crackle of an old radio, the sound of rain tapping against the kitchen window.
She was quiet but stubborn, a romantic daydreamer who filled sketchbooks with the colors and shapes she wished the world would see. School was a place she excelled at with little to no effort. By the time she stood at the podium as valedictorian, her voice trembling, she believed the path ahead was hers to shape. Art galleries, travel, a name whispered in admiration.
College was only an hour’s drive away, just across the city, but it might as well have been in another world. That’s where she met him. The boy who called her “his little artist,” who at first made her laugh, then made her flinch. His disapproval arrived in quiet doses.. a raised eyebrow at her paintings, a sigh when she stayed up sketching all night. Over time, it became sharper. Louder. His hands, once warm, turned into something that left marks she hid under sweaters, even in the summer heat.
The night she left, she didn’t tell him. She didn’t tell anyone. She packed her brushes and canvases first, clothes second, and caught the earliest bus west. She told herself she wasn’t running, just.. starting over. A smaller neighborhood, quiet streets, an old house with peeling paint. She didn’t know yet who might be watching from the shadows of those streets. She didn’t know yet how often she’d find the same man at the coffee shop, in the corner of a bookstore, or across the produce aisle…

Name: Silas Draven Vale
Age: 25
Birthdate: March 28 2000
Gender: M

Backstory: 
Silas grew up in a small quiet town, where appearance mattered more than truth. His father was around, but he was cold, distant and very strict. His mother was timid, fragile and very frail. The kind of woman to put on a smile even through the roughest terrain. Growing up he was like every other young boy. Happy and playful, a real jokester. But into his teen hood he began to change, he wouldn't say for the worse but definitely not for the better if you asked others around him. He began to blend into the background, remembering people's routines without realizing. Who took which bus after school, where they liked to sit, their habits during breaks or lunch. What made them smile. He began to feel off from his peers, not having the biggest emotions towards friends or family. Besides his mother of course. He had his first love at the age of 16. But that ended after only a few short months. She was scared of him, the things he'd say or do. She told him he knew more about her than she knew herself. So she broke things off which caused him to spiral. He got into fights in and out of school constantly when he noticed someone getting close to his love. To the point he got expelled, the only high school in Silverbriar BC, he decided to move out after his fathers constant drinking and torment. Leaving his mother behind yet he still regrets not bringing her with him. One rainy night Silas was sitting outside on the steps of “Ivory & Ash” his knuckles split and bleeding. Silas was found by Evie Macken, the widowed owner. She brought him inside, offered him tea and a job carrying heavy things in and out of the store. The quiet shop gave him peace at last. Ivory & Ash became more than just a job. Through Evie's connections, some clients brought in rare and even unregistered antiques tied to the darker corners of the town and beyond. When jobs needed to be done, Evie would give Silas a signal by leaving an ivory horse figurine on the top of the cash register, allowing him to ‘handle things’ others wouldn't dare to deal with or even want to be associated with. The shop's locked back room doubled as a safe haven for Silas, to store tools, or stash items collected on the ‘job’. The second hand goods provided a perfect cover to move stolen valuables through Evie's network.

Profile Appearance

Appearance: Silas has pale ghostly skin as he barely sees the light of day. Thick dark brown almost black hair that slightly drapes into his face, his hairstyle like a modern greaser without any product. He has a neck tattoo of a raven flying, its head wrapped around his neck and its wings/ body on his shoulder. He has an eyebrow slit on his left eye which he decided to do the day he memorized Lilienne's face seeing her beauty mark. Deep brown eyes narrow and animalistic with a sense of calm in his face. A little scary on his upper lip causing his lips to always be a tiny bit parted.

Build: Silas is 6 '2 and relatively fit. A muscular natural build with patchwork tattoos ranging from his chest, back, waist and his right arm and hands.

Clothing Style: Prefers dark, well-fitted clothing; black wool coats, worn leather jackets, cuffed sleeves showing forearm tattoos. Crisp, button-down shirts. Heavy boots, even in the rain. Always dresses with intention.. ‘nothing is careless.’

Favourite Color: Lilac purple, black, deep blue

Aesthetic: Dim streetlamps in the rain, cigarette smoke curling in cold air, rough hands resting on old wood, pressed lilac petals between the pages of an antique book.

Materialistic likes: Ivory chess pieces, old pocket watches, fountain pens, vintage revolvers, leather-bound journals, rare pressed flowers.

Voice and mannerisms: Speaks in a low, even tone. rarely raises his voice. Often tilts his head slightly when studying someone, as if dissecting every detail. Holds prolonged eye contact, rarely blinking until the other person looks away. Moves deliberately, never rushed even when others might hurry.",2,1755141772.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False
1mppcsc,https://youtu.be/0-zx73lBTHc,4 Very Scary TRUE Solo Survival Trip Horror Stories,"# ""The Self-Serve Camp"":

I started from the east coast and headed west, stopping at different spots each night. By the time I reached Oregon, I felt free, but tired from all the driving.

One evening, I drove into a small town with not much around. My gas tank was low, almost empty. I needed to fill up, but it was already dark, and I saw no stations open. I pulled over at what looked like an old logging site turned into a campground. It was quiet, with trees all around and gravel roads leading to spots for tents or RVs. A sign said it was self-serve, pay in a box. I figured I could camp here, ask someone about gas in the morning.

I drove in and saw a fire at the first site. A man and a woman sat there, maybe in their late twenties. He had a beard, she had long hair tied back. They looked up as I stopped. I rolled down my window.

""Hi,"" I said. ""Is this place okay to camp? I'm low on gas and need a spot for the night.""

The man nodded. ""Sure is. Nearest gas is two miles down the road, but it's closed now. Opens early.""

""Thanks,"" I said. ""I'll set up then.""

The next site was empty, so I parked there. It was close to theirs, but not too close. I got out my tent and started putting it up. The ground was hard, so I used a rock to hammer in the stakes. That's when the man walked over, holding a small ax.

""Need help?"" he asked. ""This ax works better than a rock.""

I paused. It felt odd, him coming over with an ax, but he seemed helpful. ""Okay, thanks.""

He hammered the stakes in quick. When he finished, I offered him a beer from my cooler. ""Want one? For the help.""

He took it. ""Sure. Name's Tom.""

""I'm Alex,"" I said. We sat by my fire pit, though I hadn't lit it yet. His woman walked over then.

""You got any pills?"" she asked straight out. ""Like for pain or something?""

I shook my head. ""Just ibuprofen. Why?""

She shrugged. ""Headache. But hey, you got weed? I heard Washington's got good stuff.""

""I picked some up there,"" I said, trying to be friendly. ""Want to share?""

We smoked a bit. They kept talking about the campground rules. ""Make sure you pay at the box,"" the man said. ""Rangers check.""

""Yeah, put money in the envelope,"" the woman added.

I nodded. ""I will.""

They said it again a few minutes later. ""Don't forget to pay.""

It started to bother me. Why repeat it? And then the woman said, ""If you got no cash, just write your card number on the paper. They take that.""

No way. That sounded wrong. Who writes card info in a box? I said, ""I think I have cash.""

The woman stood up. ""Come meet the neighbors. They're nice.""

I didn't want to, but I followed her to an RV two sites over. It looked old, parked there for months. Cardboard covered the wheels, and it was dirty. A dog lay outside. She knocked, and a man opened the door. He was over sixty, eyes red from drinking. A woman inside waved me in.

""Come eat,"" she said. ""I made tacos.""

I sat on a worn couch. The old man started talking, long story about his life, jobs he had. It dragged on. Then he ended with, ""You know Jeffrey Dahmer? He ate people. Funny, right?""

I forced a laugh, but my skin crawled. Who jokes about that? The woman pushed a taco at me. ""Eat it.""

I took it, but didn't bite. ""Thanks, but I'm full.""

When I left, I tossed the taco to the dog. Back at my site, the young couple was gone. I sat by my unlit fire, thinking. This place felt off. Why the ax? The pill question? The card thing? That joke?

Then I heard yelling from the RV. The old woman screamed, ""That's it! I've had it!""

She stormed out, walking toward my site. The young woman followed. The old one looked at me. ""I need a ride to town tomorrow. You going?""

""Uh, maybe,"" I said.

The young woman smiled. ""I'll come too. We can all go.""

My mind raced. Three strangers wanting in my car? No. I said, ""Actually, I might leave early. Real early.""

The old woman frowned. ""You sure? I need out of here.""

""Yeah, sorry.""

They walked away, but I heard whispering. I went into my tent, zipped it tight. Lay there, listening. Footsteps? Or just wind? I thought about the ax, the joke about eating people. What if they weren't just weird? What if they hurt people out here, where no one sees?

I waited an hour, heart racing quiet. Then I packed fast. Threw the tent in the car, didn't fold it right. Drove out slow, lights off at first so they wouldn't see. On the main road, I breathed easier. Less than a mile away, I saw a B&B with lights on. I knocked.

A clerk opened. ""Need a room?""

I told him about the campground, the people, the weird stuff. He listened. ""Sounds creepy. Stay here. Coffee in the morning.""

I slept in a real bed, safe. Next day, I got gas. The station guy asked where I camped. I told him.

""Those folks? Stay away. Heard stories. People go missing sometimes.""

I drove on, but I checked my mirrors all day. What if they followed? I changed my route, avoided small towns. That night changed me. Now, when I camp solo, I pick busy places. No more remote spots.





# ""Mount Rogers, Midnight"":

I started in Georgia and had been on the trail for weeks, making good progress into Virginia. I felt strong, even though my legs ached from the constant up and down.

One afternoon, I came across a man sitting by the path, strumming a guitar. He looked rough, with a beard and dirty clothes, and he had a dog with him. The dog seemed friendly, wagging its tail as I approached. ""Nice day for a hike,"" I said, trying to be polite. He looked up, his eyes distant, and muttered something about being the captain of some squad. I nodded and kept walking, not thinking much of it. Hikers come in all types.

Later that evening, I set up my tent in a small clearing near Mount Rogers. I had passed a few other people earlier, but now it was quiet. I boiled water for dinner and ate my noodles, listening to the birds settle in. As darkness came, I zipped into my sleeping bag, tired but content.

A noise woke me sometime in the night. Footsteps crunching leaves. I sat up, grabbing my headlamp. ""Who's there?"" I called out. No answer at first, then a voice, low and angry. ""This is my trail"" It was the man from earlier. I could see his outline through the tent fabric, the dog sniffing around.

""I don't want trouble,"" I said, my voice steady but my hands shaking as I searched for my knife in my pack. ""Just passing through.""

He laughed, a sharp sound. ""Passing through? I'll burn you out. Pour gasoline and watch it go up."" He kicked at the ground near my tent. I smelled something chemical, like lighter fluid maybe. Panic rose in me. I had to get out.

I unzipped the tent fast and stood up, facing him. He had a large knife in his hand, the blade catching the light from my lamp. ""Back off,"" I warned. ""Leave me alone.""

""You think you can tell me what to do?"" He stepped closer, waving the knife. The dog whined and backed away. ""I own this place""

I tried to reason. ""Look, I have food. Take it if you want. Just go.""

He lunged then, faster than I expected. The knife sliced my arm, hot pain shooting through. I screamed and swung my backpack at him, hitting his shoulder. He stumbled, but came back, slashing again. This time it caught my side, deep. Blood soaked my shirt. I fell to the ground, gasping.

He stood over me, breathing heavy. ""See what happens?"" he said. ""You shouldn't have come here.""

I lay still, eyes half-closed, holding my breath as best I could. The pain burned, but I forced myself not to move. He poked me with his foot, then turned away, muttering to himself. The dog followed him as he walked off into the trees.

Minutes passed. I counted in my head to stay calm. When I couldn't hear him anymore, I rolled over slowly. Blood everywhere. I pressed my hand to the wound on my side, wincing. My phone— I grabbed it from the tent. No signal here, deep in the valley. I had to move.

I stuffed a shirt against the cuts and tied it tight with my belt. Every step hurt, but I started walking south, back the way I came, where I knew a road crossed the trail miles away. The path was narrow, roots tripping me. Blood dripped down my leg. I whispered to myself, ""Keep going. Just keep going.""

After a while, I heard voices ahead. Two hikers, a man and a woman, at their camp. I stumbled into their light. ""Help,"" I croaked. ""A man attacked me. Knife.""

The woman jumped up. ""Oh no, sit down. You're bleeding bad."" She grabbed her first aid kit while the man tried his phone. ""No bars here,"" he said. ""We need to get to the road.""

They helped me stand. ""What did he look like?"" the man asked as we walked.

""Beard, dog, called himself John,” I said through gritted teeth. ""Threatened to burn me.""

The woman nodded. ""We heard warnings about a guy like that on the trail forums. Crazy stuff.""

We pushed on, them supporting me when I weakened. The cuts throbbed, and I felt dizzy from blood loss. ""Tell me about yourself,"" the woman said, trying to distract me. ""Where you from?""

""Canada,"" I answered. ""Started this hike alone, thought it would be good for me. Master's in biology, love the outdoors.""

""Sounds nice,"" she replied. ""Hang in there. Road's not far.""

Finally, we reached the crossing. The man got a signal and dialed emergency. ""We have a stabbed hiker,"" he told the operator. ""Appalachian Trail, Davis Hollow area. She's hurt bad.""

Sirens came soon after. Paramedics loaded me into the ambulance, starting IVs and bandaging. ""You walked miles like this?"" one asked. ""Tough lady.""

In the hospital, doctors stitched me up—multiple wounds, but nothing vital hit. Police came, and I told them everything. They found the man later, following his dog right to him.

I recovered over time, scars reminding me. That trip was supposed to heal me, but it almost ended me.





# ""Night Visitors on the Trail"":

I wanted to push my limits, spend a few days hiking and camping by myself to clear my head. I packed light: a small tent, sleeping bag, some food, water filter, and a pocket knife for cutting rope or food. I started early one morning from a quiet trailhead, feeling ready for the challenge.

The first day went fine. I covered about ten miles, passing a couple of other hikers who nodded hello but kept to themselves. By afternoon, I reached a spot near a stream where I could set up camp. As I pitched my tent, a man walked by on the trail. He looked rough, with a dirty backpack and clothes that seemed worn out. He stopped and stared at me for a moment.

""You hiking alone?"" he asked, his voice flat.

""Yes,"" I said, trying to sound casual. ""Just a short trip.""

He lingered a bit, looking around my campsite, then walked on. I watched him disappear down the path, but something about him made me uneasy. I shook it off and finished setting up, eating a quick meal of dried fruit and nuts before crawling into my tent as the light faded.

That night, I woke to footsteps crunching leaves outside. At first, I thought it might be an animal, but then I heard whispers. Two voices. I stayed still, listening. The zipper on my tent started to move slowly. I grabbed my knife from beside my sleeping bag, holding it tight.

The flap opened, and a face peered in—the same man from earlier, with a woman beside him. ""Give us the pack,"" he said, reaching for my backpack at the foot of the tent.

""What are you doing?"" I yelled, sitting up. ""Get away!""

The woman pushed in, grabbing at the bag. ""Shut up. We need this stuff.""

I slashed out with the knife, catching the man's arm. He yelped and pulled back. ""She's got a blade!""

They both lunged then, the man pinning my legs while the woman tried to wrench the knife from my hand. I kicked hard, my boot connecting with his side. He grunted and loosened his grip. I twisted free and stabbed toward the woman's foot, feeling it sink in. She screamed and stumbled back.

""Let's go!"" she hissed at him, clutching her shoe.

The man glared at me, blood dripping from his arm. ""You'll regret this.""

They scrambled out, grabbing what they could—a water bottle and some food from my pack—before running into the darkness. I zipped the tent shut, my hands trembling as I held the knife ready. I could hear them crashing through the brush, arguing in low voices as they fled.

I didn't sleep after that. I sat up, knife in hand, listening for any sound of them coming back. Every rustle made me flinch. I thought about packing up and hiking out right then, but it was too dark, and I didn't know if they were waiting nearby. So I waited, counting the minutes until dawn.

As soon as the sky lightened, I broke camp fast, stuffing everything into my pack. My legs felt weak, but I pushed on, hiking hard toward the next shelter. About two miles down, I spotted another hiker—a older guy with a full beard, resting on a log.

""Hey, you okay?"" he asked, seeing my face.

I told him what happened, my voice shaky. ""Two people attacked me last night. Tried to steal my stuff. I fought them off with my knife.""

His eyes widened. ""That's serious. Let me help. I have a satellite phone—I'll call for help.""

He dialed, explaining the situation to someone on the other end. ""Yes, a hiker was assaulted at the campsite near mile marker 45. She's safe now, but the attackers might still be around.""

While we waited, he shared his water and a snack. 

Rangers arrived an hour later, two of them on foot. I described the man and woman—their clothes, the man's cut arm, the woman's limp. ""We'll search the area,"" one ranger said.

They escorted me to a nearby town, where I got checked at a clinic. No broken bones, just bruises. Later, I found out the police caught the pair at a local hospital, treating their wounds. They had other stolen gear in their car—backpacks, tents from other hikers.

I ended my trip early, driving home with a mix of relief and fear. Now, when I think about solo hikes, I remember how quickly things turned bad. I still love the trail, but next time, I'll carry more than just a knife.





# ""Six Days on the North Face"":

I had just reached the top of Mount Goddard, standing there at over 13,000 feet, looking out at the endless rocks and distant valleys. It was my reward after months of finishing school and working nonstop. I signed the register, noting I was only the third person up here that year. My plan was simple: a few days out from Florence Lake, up the mountain, then back. I told my dad the route before I left, figuring I'd be home soon.

Descending the north side felt tricky with all the loose stones. I moved carefully, bracing against the slope. Then a small rock came free in my hand. Before I could react, a bigger one—about the size of a large backpack—tumbled down and slammed into my right calf. The crack echoed in my ears as pain exploded through my leg. I fell backward onto a patch of snow and started sliding fast, out of control, blood trailing behind me.

I dug my left heel and hand into the snow, slowing myself just before hitting sharp rocks below. When I stopped, I looked down. My tibia bone poked out through the skin, jagged and white, blood soaking everything. The sight made my head spin, but I pushed it aside. I had to act. No one knew exactly where I was, and cell service didn't exist here.

I pulled off my shorts and used my long underwear to cover the wound temporarily. With my pocketknife, I cut a piece from my sleeping pad and wrapped it around the break. I took apart my walking sticks, using the shafts as splints, and tied them tight with my belt and some straps. It hurt bad, but the pressure stopped most of the bleeding. I knew I couldn't walk, so crawling to safety was my only shot, but with my full pack, it was impossible.

I left the food and most gear behind, thinking rescue would come before I starved. I grabbed my bivy sack for shelter, a rain poncho, my knife, a whistle I tied around my neck, gloves, and hats. If things got worse, the knife could help... in a desperate way. I crab-walked to another snow patch and slid down to a flat rocky area, maybe 100 yards away. It took forever, every move sending fire up my leg. I cleared some stones to make a spot for my body, propping my leg up best I could.

Night came, and the quiet pressed in. I blew the whistle sharp and loud, yelling ""Help!"" over and over. My voice bounced off the mountains, coming back empty. No answer. I wiggled into the bivy sack, trying to stay warm, but the pain kept me awake in waves. What if no one came? My parents expected me Monday; they'd wait a day or two before worrying. I had to hold on.

By morning, a bad smell hit me—my leg. The wound looked puffy and red, infection already starting. I crawled to the snow, using a flat rock to scrape off the dirty top layer. I packed clean snow into the break, letting it melt and flush out the mess. With the knife, I gently scraped at the sticky parts, massaging my foot to keep blood moving. It was gross, yellow goo coming out, but I had no choice. I did this routine a few times that day, sipping water from melted snow in my hands.

Hunger gnawed at me. I spotted ants crawling on rocks nearby and scooped some up, crunching them down. They tasted bitter, but it was something. Later, a moth fluttered close; I grabbed it and ate that too. Small things to keep energy up. I blew the whistle again, shouting until my throat hurt. Still nothing. The loneliness crept in deeper—miles from any trail, no hikers around. What if animals smelled the blood? I pushed the thought away, focusing on my leg, keeping it elevated.

The next day blurred into more of the same. The infection spread, my calf swelling hot and tight. Pain throbbed constant now, like a hammer inside. I talked to myself to stay sharp. ""Come on, Gregg, you've fought fires, guided rafts—this is just another challenge."" But inside, fear built. What if the infection reached my blood? I knew sepsis could kill fast. I cleaned the wound again, packing more snow, but the bone looked wrong, edges turning dark. I blew the whistle in bursts, three short, three long, three short—SOS. Echoes mocked me.

On the third day, weakness hit hard. No real food, just bugs and snow water. My body shook from the effort of crawling even a little. I imagined hearing voices in the wind, but it was nothing. ""Stay calm,"" I muttered. ""Rescue's coming."" I checked my leg; the smell was worse, pus oozing steady. I scraped deeper with the knife, biting my lip against the agony. Blood mixed with the mess, but I had to clear it. Hours passed staring at the sky, willing a plane or chopper to appear. Night brought chills, even in the bivy. I whispered to myself about home, picturing my dad's face when I got back. ""I'll make it, Dad. Just hold on.""

By day four, despair snuck in. My leg felt like dead weight, numb in places but burning in others. The swelling pushed against the splint, and I loosened it a bit, scared of cutting off circulation. I ate more ants, forcing them down. Thirst wasn't bad with the snow, but hunger made me dizzy. I shouted less, saving strength, but blew the whistle every hour. The vast emptiness terrified me—rocks and sky, no life. What if I died here, alone? I shook my head. ""No. Fight."" I massaged my toes, willing them to move, but they barely twitched.

Rain came that afternoon, soaking through my poncho. I shivered hard, water pooling around me. The cold made everything worse, infection flaring up. I huddled tighter, talking aloud. ""You're strong. You've survived worse scrapes."" But doubt whispered back. Night was endless, pain spiking with every shiver. I thought of amputating—knife in hand, staring at the leg—but couldn't do it yet. Not unless death stared closer.

Day five, exhaustion weighed me down. I barely moved, just cleaned the wound weakly. The goo was thicker, smell choking. My whole body ached from infection spreading. I blew the whistle faintly, voice gone. Hope faded; maybe no one was looking. ""Please, someone find me,"" I croaked to the empty air. Bugs crawled over me, and I ate what I could catch. The isolation clawed at my mind—every rustle in the rocks made me tense, imagining predators drawn to the scent.

Then, on day six, a distant thump. A helicopter! My pulse raced. I grabbed the poncho, waving it wild despite the pain. The chopper circled closer, rotors loud. I blew the whistle nonstop, yelling hoarsely. It hovered above, a ranger leaning out. ""We see you!"" he shouted over the noise. Relief flooded me, tears mixing with sweat.

They lowered a basket, and two rescuers dropped down. One was a medic named John. ""Hang in there, buddy,"" he said, checking my leg. ""That's nasty, but you're alive."" I nodded, words failing. ""How'd you find me?"" I managed. ""Your dad reported you missing. We searched the area."" They stabilized my leg better, gave me fluids. ""You did good splinting this,"" the other said. ""Saved your life."" They hoisted me up, chopper air blasting.

In the hospital, doctors said the break was compound, infection severe, but I'd keep the leg after surgery and antibiotics. Six days alone, broken and fighting—that fear still lingers. But I made it.",1,1755141719.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

But those same environmental qualities can be tough on furniture. Humidity, airborne salt, and fluctuating temperatures can all affect the look and longevity of your interiors.

[Bontempi Casa](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/bontempi-casa) furniture is crafted with premium materials, but even the best pieces benefit from a targeted care plan. By understanding the environmental factors at play and taking consistent preventative steps, you can preserve both style and durability.

# Understanding the Challenges of Coastal and Humid Climates

Moisture in the air is a constant presence in these regions. It can cause wood to swell, joints to loosen, and upholstery to feel damp. Salt carried in sea air has a corrosive effect on metal frames and hardware. Even ceramic or glass surfaces can develop a residue film if not cleaned regularly.

Homes near the coast often have an open, indoor-outdoor flow, which means sand, water droplets, and salt spray can be introduced to your living spaces without you noticing. If your home connects directly to a patio furnished with [Vincent Sheppard](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/vincent-sheppard-outdoor) seating or **outdoor dining chairs**, those same conditions can gradually affect your Bontempi Casa indoor pieces.

# Selecting the Right Materials from the Start

If you’re purchasing Bontempi Casa furniture for a humid or coastal property, lean towards materials that naturally resist environmental stress.

* **Ceramic tops** are non-porous and unaffected by moisture.
* **Tempered glass** resists warping and swelling.
* **Powder-coated metals** are more resistant to corrosion than untreated finishes.
* **Sealed wood** offers warmth while preventing moisture absorption.

Matching these materials to the surrounding environment is key. For example, if your outdoor area is shaded by a [Glatz Parasol](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/glatz-parasols), the reduced direct UV exposure also benefits any Bontempi Casa furniture positioned near windows or doors.

# Establishing a Regular Cleaning Routine

A consistent cleaning routine is your first line of defence. In coastal homes, airborne salt can settle quickly on surfaces. For best results:

* Wipe all surfaces weekly with a slightly damp, soft cloth, followed by a dry cloth to remove moisture.
* For metal frames, this routine helps prevent rust formation.
* For ceramic or glass, it maintains a clear, streak-free surface.
* Upholstered areas should be vacuumed with an upholstery attachment to remove dust, sand, and allergens.

If you own **Vincent Sheppard** or other high-quality **outdoor dining chairs**, applying the same cleaning principles helps keep both indoor and outdoor furnishings in sync visually and structurally.

# Preventing Moisture Damage in Upholstery

Humidity can lead to mildew growth inside fabrics. To counter this:

* Use moisture-resistant upholstery sprays on fabric-covered chairs and sofas.
* Position furniture slightly away from exterior walls, which can be cooler and more prone to condensation.
* Consider removable, washable covers during the dampest months.

If you often keep patio doors open to enjoy views of your **Glatz Parasols** and outdoor seating, be aware that moisture-laden air enters freely. Using a discreet indoor mat can reduce the transfer of damp air and debris into living spaces.

# Indoor Humidity Control

Dehumidifiers can make a dramatic difference in coastal homes. Place one in the main living area where your Bontempi Casa pieces are most exposed. Ventilation is also essential—but be strategic. On very damp or misty days, limit open windows to avoid drawing in excess moisture.

Consider an extractor fan in connected dining or kitchen areas, especially if you regularly entertain and use spaces that lead to outdoor terraces with **outdoor dining chairs** and **Glatz Parasols**.

# Caring for Metal and Wood Finishes

Metal frames benefit from a twice-yearly application of a corrosion-resistant wax or spray. This protective layer helps prevent the salt in coastal air from pitting or discolouring the surface. For wood finishes, an occasional application of high-quality furniture oil will nourish the surface and maintain its natural sheen.

If your living space overlooks a garden with **Vincent Sheppard** seating, think about harmonising finishes—polishing both your indoor and outdoor wood to a similar tone enhances visual flow between areas.

# Seasonal Maintenance Strategy

A detailed seasonal plan keeps wear and tear under control:

* **Spring:** Clean thoroughly after winter condensation. Check metal parts for early rust spots and treat immediately.
* **Summer:** Protect against strong sunlight—use blinds or reposition furniture away from direct rays.
* **Autumn:** Perform a deep clean before humidity peaks in late autumn and winter.
* **Winter:** Cover lesser-used items with breathable dust covers and maintain stable indoor humidity.

# Managing Indoor-Outdoor Transitions

Many coastal UK homes blur the boundary between inside and outside living. If you have sliding doors opening to a terrace with **outdoor dining chairs**, coordinate your care routine across both spaces. For example, cleaning your Bontempi Casa coffee table and your Vincent Sheppard outdoor seating at the same time ensures neither is neglected.

A large **Glatz Parasol** outside not only shades the patio but can also block direct sun from entering through glass doors, protecting your interior furniture from fading.

# Storage and Rotation

When possible, rotate furniture positions every few months to distribute environmental exposure evenly. If you own smaller accent pieces, store them during the dampest months. This prevents gradual deterioration and helps maintain a fresh appearance when reintroduced.

# Final Thought

The sea air and gentle breezes of the UK’s coastal regions are part of their charm, but they demand extra care for fine furniture. By choosing resilient materials, cleaning regularly, managing humidity, and taking cues from durable outdoor elements like **Vincent Sheppard** seating and **Glatz Parasols**, your Bontempi Casa pieces can stay beautiful and functional for decades.",1,1755141700.0,u_Business_Refuse_9579,0,1.0,False

The other day, it was my birthday. Invited her with 2 of my other friends. Gave 3k for the 4.7k bill and asked them to just split the remaining. She didn’t flinch at all! Now my 2 friends were asking for her share. I apologize on her behalf and asked that I’ll cover her share na lang.

Me and my 2 close friends have a mutual understanding of splitting the bills. Doesn’t matter if there’s an occasion or wtvr. Kase we’re not that well off ‘yet’ so sharing is caring talaga.

1mppbyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BFS/comments/1mppbyb/positive_update/,Positive update,"I know everyone is different but I wanted to share a positive update on symptoms.  

Background:

I started getting twitches about 5 months ago, first in my ear which freaked me out thinking it was a brain tumor may have been the primary trigger.  After a brain MRI and health exam coming back fine, quitting coffee for a week, fasting, trying various supplements, nothing seemed to change.  I was getting daily twitching all over, some days with hot spots that wouldn't stop for 10s of minutes to hours.

Finally I went to an actual neurologist and after doing muscle tests he told me essentially what we already know in some sense, that:

 ""this happens a lot in perfectly healthy people, thinking and worrying about it makes it worse, so try not to think about it, you're ok""

At first I felt slightly disappointed because I kind of already knew that from this forum and I wanted even more thorough tests, but for whatever reason ever since that appointment the twitching has significantly reduced.  It's still happens a few times during the day but the amount of times I think ""wow it hasn't happened in awhile, this is unusual"" is increasing.  Baseline normality would probably be like a few times a week, back when we didn't even think it was weird.

When they do happen I just breath and ignore, continue doing what I'm doing, or I might repeat that Dr's words in my head like ""healthy people get this, it's normal"" and move on.

Anyway it's only been about a week since that appointment so I'll monitor things, but definitely a significant improvement. 

Also somewhat unrelated, I happened to see an interview from Andrew Huberman with a guy that studies ear tinnitus.  There's actually a part where he says tinnitus sufferers exacerbate them problem by their anxiety with it.  It sounds very similar to BFS, maybe check that out.",2,1755141651.0,BFS,0,1.0,False

1mppadw,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1mppadw/unneeded_construction_because_of_a_burger_and/,Un-needed construction because of a burger and shake.,"This story start when I was 20 then there is a time jump! When I was 20 I had gastric by pass surgery. A side effect of the surgery is called dumping syndrome. Basically if I eat high fat or sugar my foods I start to feel ill and I take some really bad smelling bowel movements. 

Jump to 28 and I had to have my gall bladder removed. Also a son on side effect of gastric bypass pass. This made it so deep fried foods also give me dumping syndrome. 

This event happed right after the pandemic so I’m in my late 30’s and we had just gotten back to office for the engineering company I worked for. I had fallen into eating like crap again during the stay at home phase of the pandemic and quite frequently would get strong bad gas. The smell was bad but the worst part was it would linger… for quite a while. The fact that I drank a lot at night because I had gotten divorced during the pandemic and was pretty depressed didn’t help my gut health. My drink of choice was dark coffee beers and they really didn’t help my gut. 

Some co workers I had gone out for lunch and I went ham as I had some extra cash this restraint by us had these killer burgers where they would deep fry the Pattie’s and stuff them with cheese and they were amazing. I tend to stay away from such things as I know how it will end but I said fuck it and I got a deep fried burger with home made onion rings and a Vanilla milk shake for the local lunch place and they did not skip on anything. High fat lots of sugar and tasty as hell! I knew better but I really didn’t care at this point in my life. We ate and want back to the office and all was fine for about an hour then my stomach started to gurgle. 

Now with the tri-fecta of dumping syndrome, drinking my self stupid the night before and greasy high fat food. I knew it was going to be bad. I stood up and walked to the bathrooms which were across the floor of the building we worked on. Now our desks were still arranged that none of us were sitting close together because it was the pre-pandemic, seating chart where everyone was social distancing.. as I walked I could no longer hold in some of the gas. So I squeaked out small gas bombs the entire way to the bathroom, but luckily because of the pandemic seating situation, I didn’t have to walk by any of my coworkers. 

I got to the bathroom did my business wash my hands and started my walk back to my desk. 

When I opened the bathroom door and turned the corner, I noticed the hallway still smelled like the bathroom, and as I walked back to my desk, the entire way smelled like ungodly sewage. It was horrifying the hallway from the bathroom to my desk, which were a pretty good distance all smelled horrific. 

Those little bombs I was dropping were little nuclear warheads of bad decisions and dark beer. 

I made it back to my desk without running into anyone which is probably good as I’m pretty sure anyone would’ve pinned that on me had they had to walk through it after I walk through the hall

I sat at my desk for a good 10 minutes, and the smell never dissipated. It was so thick in the air you could almost taste it.

Now the building we worked and it was old, but it wasn’t old old. Even though it still had gargoyles on the top of it, most of it had been refurbished and we worked on two floors.

Well, sitting at my desk, wondering when someone was going to say something the CFO of the company wandered in to my cubicle area from the hall way.

This was the conversation.

Him: do you smell sewage…

Me: no

Him: you can’t smell that. When were you last tested? (For Covid)

Me: Actually yesterday funny enough. 

Him: well I smell sewage.

Guy from 6 cubicles down: do you guys smell that?

Me: well I smell it now that you pointed it out (Lie)

What ensued was an hour long find the source of the smell hit with 5 adults trying to pinpoint the source of the smell. 

Now I titles this unneeded construction for my final part.

The CFO was convinced there was a burst pipe somewhere in Thai building and he was smelling it. it didn’t help that an hour later you could still smell it. He call in every contractor we worked with and with in 2 days there were holes in the walls and blue prints spread across unused desks a construction area with a remodel of the bathroom in progress. It was chaos and with as fast as they did all their tear down and build up it must have cost a pretty penny when all was said and done as a week later the office looked like it was never touched and we have brand new bathrooms. 

All becuase I wanted a deep fried cheese burger. S a vanilla shake…

I guess I feel less bad about it because we ended our working relationship on bad terms… this is also the first and only times I ever told that story. ",4,1755141521.0,confession,1,1.0,False

It's one of those modern white stone countertops and you can see what it looks like if you google *white stone kitchen countertop*. The problem is that my father's girlfriend seems to have this problem where she thinks anything will ruin and stain the countertop. 

She spreads out a bunch of little cleaning cloths all over it permanently that covers like 50% of the counter  and if she wants to place anything down she places it on the cloth. If you place anything down not on a cloth she gets mad; even if it's something benign like an empty clean piece of tupperware. 

She bought a chair to sit down while washing dishes and she has banned using the tap with high pressure ( as in you can't open the tap more than \~25% of the way) as she thinks the dish water will get out and damage the counter. She tries to convince me to use the chair as well because she thinks it reduces the chance of water getting out. I'm a foot taller than her so that would be uncomfortable but she's not too bothered about the chair thing. She isn't happy if put my coffee cup on the counter when I'm making my coffee; I usually make a coffee when she's not in the kitchen to avoid the drama. 

She got upset at me recently because I left the blade sharpener out to dry by placing it down on the counter. I feel like I get told off every few days for something extremely benign. She wasn't like this with the previous kitchen and she has no reason to think I'd damage anything; in fact she's damaged multiple things like the wooden table by placing a hot pot on it and the recent cooktop is already damaged with bubbles under the glass (i don't use it). I'm usually the one that cleans and maintains a lot of the kitchen as I have higher standards for how often things should be cleaned. 

I'm thinking she's like this maybe because her job involves dealing with people with intellectual and emotional disabilities so maybe she's dealing with people who damage things constantly and is just bringing that anxiety home with her?

Is she overreacting or am I in the wrong? There's no real solution here I just wanna know if I'm the asshole. ",3,1755141446.0,AmItheAsshole,10,1.0,False

A year of constant motion, barely one step ahead of the Venators hunting her. A flight to Buenos Aires followed by one to Dubai. A sleepless night in a youth hostel in Amsterdam followed by another in a bunk bed in an auditorium in Bruges.  
  
  She had marked her sixteenth birthday aboard the Trans-Siberian Railway, celebrating with a cup of watery Nescaf¨  
  
  coffee and several crumbly Russian tea cookies. Somehow, her best friend, Oliver Hazard-Perry, had found a candle to light in one of the suharkies.

They had arrived to find most of the city a ghost town: bakeries, boutiques, and bistros shuttered while their proprietors absconded to three-week vacations in the beaches up north. The only people around were American and Japanese tourists, who mobbed every museum gallery, every garden in every public square, inescapable and ubiquitous in their white sneakers and baseball caps. But Schuyler welcomed their presence. She hoped the slow-moving crowds would make it easier for her and Oliver to spot their Venator pursuers. Schuyler had been able to disguise herself by changing her physical features, but performing the mutatio was taking a toll on her. She didn't say anything to Oliver, but lately she couldn't even do so much as change the color of her eyes.  
  
  And now, after almost a year of hiding, they were coming out into the open. It was a gamble, but they were desperate. Living without the protection and wisdom of the secret society of vampires and their select group of trusted humans had taken its toll. And while neither of them would ever admit it, they were both tired of running.  
  
  So for now Schuyler was seated in the back of a bus, wearing a pressed white shirt buttoned to the neck over slim black pants and flat black shoes with rubber soles. Her dark hair was pulled back in a ponytail, and except for a hint of lip gloss, she wore no makeup. She meant to blend in with the rest of the catering staff who had been hired for the evening. But surely someone would notice. Surely someone would hear how hard her heart was beating, would remark on how her breathing was shallow and quick. She had to calm down. She had to clear her mind and become the blas¨  
  
  contract caterer she was pretending to be. For so many years Schuyler had excelled at being invisible. This time, her life depended on it. The bus was taking them over a bridge to the H'tel Lambert on the isle Saint-Louis, a small island on the Seine River. The Lambert was the most beautiful house in the most beautiful city in the world. At least, she had always thought so. Although ""house"" was putting it mildly. ""Castle"" was more like it, something out of a fairy tale, its massive river walls and gray mansard roofs rising from the surrounding mist. As a child she had played hide-and-seek in the formal gardens, where the conical sculpted trees reminded her of figures on a chessboard. She remembered staging imaginary productions inside the grand courtyard and throwing bread crumbs to the geese from the terrace overlooking the Seine. How she had taken that life for granted! Tonight she would not enter the hotel's exclusive, exalted domain as an invited guest, but rather as a humble servant. Like a mouse creeping into a hole. Schuyler was anxious by nature, and she needed almost all her self-control to keep it together. At any moment she feared she might scream, she was already so nervous she couldn't stop her hands from trembling. They vibrated, fluttering in her lap like trapped birds.  
  
  Next to her, Oliver was handsome in a bartender's uniform, a tuxedo with a black silk bow tie and silver shirt studs. But he was pale beneath his butterfly collar, his shoulders tense under a jacket that was a little too big. His clear hazel eyes were clouded, looking more gray than green. Oliver's face did not display the same blank, bored look as the others. He was alert, ready for a fight or flight. Anyone who looked at him long enough could see it.  
  
  We shouldn't be here, Schuyler thought. What were we thinking? The risk is too great. They're going to find us and separate us. . . and then. . . well, the rest was too horrible to contemplate.  
  
  She was sweating under her starched shirt. The air-conditioning wasn't working, and the bus was packed. She leaned her head against the windowpane. Lawrence had been dead for over a year now. Four hundred forty-five days. Schuyler kept count, thinking that maybe once she hit a magical number, it would stop hurting.  
  
  This was no game, although sometimes it felt like a horrid, surreal version of cat and mouse. Oliver put a hand on top of hers to try and stop her hands from shaking. The tremors had begun a few months ago, just a slight twitching, but soon she realized she had to concentrate whenever she did something as simple as pick up a fork or open an envelope. She knew what it was, and there was nothing she could do about it. Dr. Pat had told her the first time she visited her office: she was the only one of her kind, Dimidium Cognato, the first half-blood, and there was no telling how her human body would react to the transformation into immortal; there would be side effects, obstacles particular to her case. Still, she felt better once Oliver held her hand in his. He always knew what to do. She depended on him for so much, and her love for him had only deepened in the year they had spent together. She squeezed his hand, intertwined her fingers around his. It was his blood that ran through her veins, his quick thinking that had secured her freedom.  
  
  As for everyone and everything they had left behind in New York, Schuyler did not dwell on it anymore. All of that was in the past. She had made her choice and was at peace with it. She had accepted her life for what it was. Once in a while she missed her friend Bliss very keenly, and more than once wanted to get in touch with her, but that was out of the question. No one could know where they were. No one. Not even Bliss.  
  
  Maybe they would be lucky tonight. Their luck had held so far. Oh, there had been a few close calls here and there, that one evening in Cologne when she'd abruptly run from a woman who had asked for directions to the cathedral. Illuminata had given the agent away. Schuyler had caught that soft imperceptible glow in the twilight before booking as fast as she could. Disguises only went so far. At some point, your true nature revealed itself.  
  
  Wasn't that what the Inquisitor had argued during the official investigation into the events in Rio? That maybe Schuyler wasn't who she was supposed to be?  
  
  Outlaw. Fugitive. That's what she was now. Certainly not Lawrence Van Alen's grieving granddaughter.  
  
  No.  
  
  According to the Conclave, she was his killer.  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  Mimi  
  
  Oh, gross! She'd stepped in something icky. Beyond icky. It squished beneath her foot, a wet, gasping sound. Whatever it was, it was sure to ruin her pony-hair boots. What was she doing wearing pony-hair boots to a reconnaissance mission anyway? Mimi Force lifted her heel and assessed the damage. The zebra pattern was stained with something brown and leaky.  
  
  Beer? Whiskey? A combination of all the bottom-shelf alcohol they served in this place? Who knew? For the umpteenth time this year, she wondered why on earth she'd ever signed up for this assignment. It was the last week of August. By all rights she should be on a beach in Capri, working on her tan and her fifth limoncello. Not creeping around some honky-tonk bar in the middle of the country. Somewhere between the dust bowl and the rust belt, or was it the rust bowl and the dust belt? Wherever they were, it was a sleepy, sad little place, and Mimi couldn't wait to leave it.  
  
  ""What's wrong?"" Kingsley Martin nudged her. 'shoes too tight again?""  
  
  ""Will you leave me alone?"" she sighed, moving away from him, making it clear she found the alcove they were hiding in too close quarters. She was tired of his teasing. Especially since, to her com  
plete and utter horror, she discovered she was starting to like it. That was simply unacceptable. She hated Kingsley Martin. After everything that he'd done to her, she couldn't see how she could feel otherwise.  
  
  ""But where's the fun in that?"" He winked. The most infuriating thing about Kingsley, other than the fact that he had once tried to bring about her demise, was that somewhere between chasing down leads on the beaches of Punta del Este or through the skyscrapers of Hong Kong, Mimi had started to find him. . . attractive. It was enough to make her stomach turn.  
  
  ""C'mon, Force, lighten up. You know you want me,"" he said with a smug smile.  
  
  ""Oh my god!"" she huffed, turning around so that her long blond hair whipped over her shoulder and hit him square in the face. ""As if!""  
  
  He might be faster and stronger than she was, the big man on the Venator team, and for all intents and purposes her boss, but really she should be the one leading them, as she outranked him in the Conclave hierarchy. If you could call that sorry group of cowards a Conclave.  
  
  Kingsley Martin had another think coming if he thought he had any chance with her. He might be too cute for words (damn those rock-star looks), but it didn't matter one iota. She was not interested, no matter how much her pulse quickened whenever he was near. She was bound to another.  
  
  ""Mmm. Nice. You don't use the hotel shampoo from the airport Hilton, do you? This is the good stuff,"" he purred. ""But is it the conditioner that makes it so soft and silky?""  
  
  ""Shut up. . . just?""  
  
  ""Hold on. Save your speech for the after-party. I see our guy. You ready?"" Kingsley interrupted, his voice serious now, controlled.  
  
  ""Like a shot. "" Mimi nodded, all business as well. She saw their witness, the reason they were a few miles outside of Lincoln, Nebraska (that was it! She remembered now) in the first place. A former frat boy, probably just shy of thirty, with a baby beer gut and the beginnings of middle-age ""carb face"" He was the type of guy who looked like he'd played cornerback in high school, but whose pounds of muscle had turned to fat after a few years behind a desk.  
  
  ""Good, because this is not going to be easy,"" Kingsley warned. ""Okay, the boys will bring him to that corner booth and we'll follow. Square him off and then go. No one will notice as long as we don't get up. Waitress won't even bother to come around. ""  
  
  It was easier and more painless to enter the mind of another during REM sleep, but they didn't have the luxury of waiting until their suspect had drifted off to la-la land.  
  
  Instead they planned to barge into his subconscious with no warning and no consideration. Better that way: there would be no place for him to hide. No time to prepare. They wanted the unadulterated truth, and this time they were going to get it.  
  
  The Venators were truth-tellers, skilled in the ability to decipher dreams and access memories. While only a bloodletting would allow them to tell true memory from false, there were other, quicker ways to discriminate fact from fiction without having to resort to the Sacred Kiss. Mimi learned that the Committee only consented to the blood trial when a most grievous charge had been levied, as in her case. Otherwise, the practice of memory hunting, venatio, while not infallible, was acceptable for their purposes. Mimi had been given a crash course in Venator training before joining up. It helped that she had been one in previous lifetimes. Once she had relearned the basics, it was just like riding a bike, her core memories kicked in and the whole exercise became second nature.  
  
  Mimi watched as Sam and Ted Lennox, the twin brothers who rounded out their Venator team, led their witness to a dark corner booth. They had been plying him with pitcher after pitcher of beer at the bar. Mr. Glory Days probably thought he'd just made a couple of new friends. As soon as they sat down, Kingsley slipped into the opposite bench, Mimi right next to him.  
  
  ""Hey, buddy, remember us?"" he asked.  
  
  ""Huh?"" The guy was awake, but drunk and drowsy. Mimi felt a twinge of pity. He had no idea what was about to happen.  
  
  ""I'm sure you remember her,"" Kingsley said, guiding the witness to lock eyes with Mimi.  
  
  Mimi held Frat Boy with her shoulder, and for all anyone in the real world knew, the dude was just entranced with the pretty blonde, staring deep into her green eyes.  
  
  ""Now,"" Kingsley ordered.  
  
  Without a moment to spare, the four Venators stepped into the glom, taking the witness with them. It was as easy as slipping down the rabbit hole.  
CHAPTER 3  
  
  Bliss  
  
  When she woke up that morning, the first thing that came to mind was that the bright white shutters looked familiar. Why did they look familiar? No. That wasn't right. That wasn't the right question to ask. She was getting ahead of herself again. It happened. But now she had to concentrate. Every day she had to ask herself three very important questions, and that wasn't one of them.  
  
  The first question she had to ask herself was, What is my name? She couldn't remember.  
  
  It was like trying to decipher a scribble on a sheet of paper. She knew what it was supposed to say, but she couldn't make out the handwriting. Like having something just out of reach, behind a closed door, and she had lost the key. Or like waking up blind. She groped wildly in the dark and tried not to panic.  
  
  ""What is my name?""  
  
  Her name. She had to remember her name. Otherwise. . . otherwise. . . she didn't want to think about it.  
  
  Once upon a time there was a girl named. . . ""  
  
  Once upon a time there was a girl named. . .  
  
  She had an unusual name. She knew that much. It wasn't the kind of name that you found on ceramic coffee mugs at airport gift shops or emblazoned on mini-license plate souvenirs you could hang on your bedroom door after you returned from Disneyland. Her name was pretty and unusual and had meaning. Something that meant snow or breath or joy or happiness or. . .  
  
  Bliss. Yes. That was it. Bliss Llewellyn. That was her name! She'd remembered! She hugged it to herself as tight as she could. Her name. Her self. As long as she could remember who she was, she was okay. She wouldn't go crazy. At least not today.  
  
  But it was hard. It was so, so hard because now there was the Visitor to consider. The Visitor who was in her, who was her, for all intents and purposes. The Visitor who answered to her name. She called him the Visitor because it made it easier for her to believe that her situation would be temporary. What did visitors do, after all? They left.  
  
  Bliss wondered, were you still you if someone else made the decisions? Spoke in your voice? Walked with your legs? Used your hands to bring death to the person you loved the most?  
  
  She shuddered. A sudden unbidden memory came to her. A black-haired boy lying limp in her arms. Who was that? The answer was somewhere, but she would have to dig for it. The image faded. Hopefully she would remember later. Right now she had to move on to the second question. Where am I?  
  
  The shutters. The shutters were a clue. It was enough that she was able to see something. It happened so rarely now. Most of the time she woke up in darkness. She concentrated on the shutters. They were wooden and painted white. Charming in a way, something that recalled a farmhouse or an English cottage, except they were too bright, too shiny and perfect. More like Martha Stewart's idea of an English cottage than a real one. Ah. No wonder they looked familiar.  
  
  Bliss knew where she was now. If she could still smile, she would have. The Hamptons. She was in her Hamptons house. They were in Cotswold. Bobi Anne had named the house. Bobi Anne? Bliss saw an image of a tall, lanky woman wearing too much makeup and gargantuan jewelry. She could even smell her stepmother's noxious perfume. Everything was coming back now, and coming back fast.  
  
  One summer during a dinner party at a famous designer's house, Bobi Anne had learned that all the great houses in the area had names. Owners dubbed their homes ""Mandalay? or ""Oak Valley? according to how pretentious they were. Bliss had suggested they name theirs Dune House for the large sand dune at the beachfront edge of the property. But Bobi Anne had other ideas. ""Cotswold. "" The woman had never even been to England.  
  
  Okay. Bliss was relieved. She'd figured out where she was, but it didn't make sense.  
  
  What was she doing in the Hamptons?  
  
  She was a stranger in her own life, a tourist in her own body. If someone had asked her what it was like, Bliss would have explained it this way: it's like you're driving a car, but you're sitting in the backseat. The car is driving itself, and you're not in control. But it's your car, at least you think it is. It used to be yours, anyway.  
  
  Or like being in a movie. The movie is your life, but you don't star in it anymore. Someone else is kissing the handsome lead and making the dramatic monologues. You're just watching. Bliss was an observer of her own life. She was not Bliss anymore, but simply the memory of the Bliss that had been.  
  
  Sometimes she wasn't even sure that she had ever really existed.  
  
  CHAPTER 4  
  
  Schuyler  
  
  The bus pulled to a stop up past the gates, and the group silently filed out. Schuyler noticed that even the most jaded of her coworkers, a rather haughty collection of moonlighting actors and actresses along with a smug culinary student or two, were looking around in amazement. The building and its immaculate grounds were as opulent and intimidating as the Louvre, except someone still lived here. It was a home, not a national monument. The H'tel Lambert had been closed to the public for much of its history. Only a vaunted few had been welcomed inside its massive doors. The rest of the world could leaf through pictures of it in books. Or enter as catering staff .  
  
  As they walked past the burbling fountains, Oliver nudged her. ""All right?"" he asked in French. One more reason to be thankful for the Duchesne School. Years of mandatory foreign language requirements meant they had been able to pass for two restaurant workers from Marseille at the job interview, although their textbook accents were in danger of giving them away at any time.  
  
  ""You look worried. What's wrong?""  
  
  ""Nothing. I was just thinking about the investigation again,, Schuyler said as they made their way toward the service entrance located at the back of the house. She remembered that terrible day at the Repository, when she'd been accused so unjustly. ""How could they have believed that of me?""  
  
  ""Don't waste any more time on it. It's not going to change anything,"" Oliver said firmly. ""What happened on Corcovado was terrible, and it wasn't your fault. ""  
  
  Schuyler nodded, blinking back the tears that came whenever she thought of that day. Oliver was right as always. She was wasting energy wishing for another outcome. What was past was past. They had to focus on the present.  
  
  ""Isn't this place beautiful?"" she said. Then, whispering so no one would hear, ""Cordelia brought me here a couple of times, when she came for meetings with Prince Henri. We stayed in the guest apartments in the east wing. Remind me to show you the Hercules galleries and the Polish library. They have Chopin's piano. ""  
  
  She felt a mixture of awe and sadness as she followed the hushed crowd through the gleaming marble halls. Awe at the beauty of the place, which had been built by the same architect who had designed the Palace of Versailles, and displayed the same gilded moldings and baroque flourishes, and sadness because the building reminded her of Cordelia. She could sure use some of her grandmother's brusque tenacity right then. Cordelia Van Alen wouldn't think twice about crashing a party to get what she wanted, whereas Schuyler had too many doubts.  
  
  The party that evening was called A Thousand and One Nights, in homage to the extravagant Oriental Ball thrown at the residence in 1969. Like that party, tonight's would feature dancing slave girls, half-naked torchbearers, zither players, and Hindu musicians. Of course, there would also be a few modern additions: the entire cast from a Bollywood musical would perform at midnight, and instead of having papier-mache elephants at the entrance, a pair of real Indian elephants had been borrowed from a traveling Thai circus. The pachyderms would be carrying riders under golden canopies.  
  
  The newspapers had already nicknamed it The Last Party. The party to end all parties. The party that would mark the end of an era. The last night that the fabled building would house royalty.  
  
  Because the H'tel Lambert had been sold. Tomorrow it would no longer be home to the surviving family of Louis- Philippe, the last king of France. Tomorrow the property would belong to a foreign conglomerate. Tomorrow the chateau would fall into the hands of developers who were ri  
ch enough to have met its steep asking price. Tomorrow it would be divided up, or renovated, or made into a museum, or whatever the conglomerate had planned for it.  
  
  But tonight it was the scene of one last grand Bal des Vampires: Parisian Blue Blood society gathering together one final time in a celebration worthy of Scheherazade.  
  
  ""Cordelia told me Balzac made a pass at her once, during a ball here. She was a deb then, in an earlier cycle, before she became my grandmother,"" she told Oliver as they made their way down into the vast basement kitchens, where modern stainless-steel appliances were installed next to medieval hearths.  
  
  ""She said he was pretty drunk. Can you imagine?""  
  
  ""One of France's leading lights hitting on an eighteen-year-old girl?"" He smirked, pushing open a swinging door. ""Totally. ""  
  
  The party was in two hours, and they found the cooks angrily yelling at each other, the whole kitchen in a flurry of hurried preparation. Steam was billowing from giant industrial- size vats, and the place smelled of sizzling butter, smoky and delicious.  
  
  ""What are you doing here?"" the head chef demanded when the wait staff arrived. ""Allez, allez, upstairs with you?""  
  
  The chef had a brief argument with the staff director, but in the end they agreed that the servers could help the grounds crew, and Schuyler and Oliver were separated.  
  
  Schuyler was sent outside, where she found the elephant trainers explaining to the actor and actress playing the King and Queen of Siam how to manage the beasts. Looking to be useful, she set about lighting candles, smoothing down tablecloths, and arranging the floral centerpieces just so. All around her, the courtyard was a cacophony of noise, with performers and acrobats jumping off the roofs, musicians tuning up, and dancing slave girls giggling at the half-naked male models. Finally all the candles were lit. The tables were set. Every thing was ready. One thing was for sure. This was going to be some party.  
  
  She found Oliver polishing glassware at his station.  
  
  ""Remember, meet me at the bottom of the staircase after your first round,"" Oliver whispered, trying not to attract too much attention from the other servers. ""I'll look out for you. "" They had been ordered by their superiors to turn off their cell phones, not that it mattered since neither of them was able to get a signal. No cell phone towers were allowed on the exclusive part of the island.  
  
  Schuyler nodded. They had their assignments: she would be part of the team responsible for welcoming guests with trays of champagne the minute they alighted from the boats. Oliver would be upstairs, working the back bar.  
  
  ""And, Sky? It'll be all right. She'll have to see you. "" He smiled. ""I'll make sure of it. "" His bravado endeared him to her even more. Dear, sweet, kind Oliver, who had left everything he loved in New York to save and protect her. She knew he was just as afraid as she was, but he wasn't going to show it.  
  
  Tonight's plan was a long shot at best. She didn't even know if the Countess of Paris, the evening's hostess and the soon-to-be-former owner of the H'tel Lambert, would remember her. Much less offer them the refuge they so desperately sought. But she had to ask, for her sake and for Oliver's. And if she ever wanted vengeance on the demon who had killed her grandfather, she had to try.  
  
  The European Conclave was her last and only hope.

Either I've met my future wife, or I'll never see her again. But life is short either way.","Today, I (25M) met an attractive young woman (mid-20's?) after work in my apartment building's elevator. While I was waiting for the elevator after arriving from work, she entered the building and immediately caught my eye. She went to grab her mail and a package, and I waited for the elevator, glancing at her a few times. The elevator arrived about a minute later, and in that moving box, we struck up probably a minute-long conversation (about what was inside the package she was holding in her hands) as we rode up to our floors. She was wearing scrubs, and I noticed she was a vet school student. But because I'm kind of a schmuck, I didn't actually get her name. I have a tendency to do that. But she appeared to be flirting back at me as I was to her, and I think she's pretty damn cute. So I've taken the liberty of doing a thing.

I'm about to put a bright yellow post-it note in the elevator saying essentially what I just told you. The note will read:

""To the cute \[her school's name\] vet student I met in this very elevator yesterday--I enjoyed our brief chat, but I'm disappointed I never got your name. Guess I was too flustered to think straight, since you koala-fied as the highlight of my day. I'd love to grab coffee, and I'm turtle-y hoping you say yes.""

I added my phone number (NOT my apartment number, so as to prevent unprecedented embarrassment in my building) and a smile face.

I don't see people to often in my building, partly because it's new, but partly because I'm out and about due to work, the gym, and other shenanigans. People also tend to move, so there's that. Point is, she'll likely see the note, but whether she will text/call me (or whether I'll bump into her again) is another question entirely.

But I live for these moments. Life is short, so take advantage of opportunities like these. Have an ""F it"" mentality. Shoot your shot. Live.",2,1755140781.0,dating_advice,6,0.63,False

1mpp07r,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1mpp07r/managing_mental_tiredness_after_work/,Managing mental tiredness after work,"I’m looking for some support on how other people with highly mentally demanding jobs manage productivity and engagement in personal life after work. I am a mental health therapist and almost all of my paid hours during my work day are person facing- unless I am providing therapy I am not likely getting paid. My typical routine is wake up, go to the gym, come back have coffee and have 20 min on my phone, get ready for work and if I have an extra 20 min do something like straighten up or put away dishes, then head to work and do admin work for 1 hour, then have 3 clients, hour lunch break that I need to fully use for admin, then another three clients, write those notes, and go home. I really don’t get any breaks during my day but I do that because I need that hour for admin responsibilities. I used to have another session after the later three but I would be so brain dead it’s not worth offering anymore. My problem is that my time in the morning when I am most mentally available I don’t have enough time to finish dishes/laundry/etc or handle personal emails or just basic personal life maintenance, so it gets pushed to after work and I just can’t complete any task after work I’m so drained. In an ideal world after work I would have SOME capacity to go for a walk, bike ride, or any other hobby I have or take care of whatever small responsibility I need to. I know there isn’t any great solutions to this but I’d love to hear how other people manage this. I do all the other things: regular workout routine, meal prep, sleep 8-9 hrs (9 is best for me), see friends on the weekend, etc.",5,1755140672.0,productivity,2,1.0,False

Story: I never thought I would be in this position—asking strangers for help.

Three years ago, I was scammed in a fake investment scheme, losing almost $100,000—including money saved for my son with autism. I also lost my job, and now my home is under mortgage with the threat of eviction.

I am just a father trying to protect and provide for my child. Right now, I feel powerless.

If you can help—even with $1—it would mean the world to us. Your kindness could keep a roof over our heads and give us hope for tomorrow.

While that spring was pointless, I was able to self-level with a similar spring design. The two main pieces of feedback I received on my last post revolved around self-leveling and food safety. I will explain those issues below.

  
Food Safety:

This spring can be printed in PLA (the most common 3D Printed Material) and does not, as some have suggested, break right away. While PLA is great for cheap printing, it is not food safe, so I have switched to using PETG for the bottom. You can buy food-safe PETG or any other food-safe material online and use it for just the bottom of the tamper. While my PETG is not certified food-safe, I have decided it is good enough for me. Of course, use non-food-safe materials at your own risk.

Self-Leveling:

The spring now only connects to an outer ring that sits on the edge of your puck and moves independently from the tamper. It works pretty well, and I believe the current version is pretty accurately level, but if you decide to print, please let me know how it works for you!

## Key Features Analysis

the best iPhone 14 Pro cases with card holders boast a range of extraordinary features designed to protect your phone and simplify your life.

**Material and Construction:** Strong and durable materials like TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane),PC (polycarbonate),or a combination of both are critical for protection against drops,scratches,and everyday wear and tear. The construction should also offer precise cutouts for easy access to ports and buttons.A Good case should provide a raised lip around the screen and camera to protect these sensitive areas from direct contact with surfaces. The interior lining should be soft to prevent scratches on the iPhone's surface. High-quality construction ensures that the case can withstand daily use and offer long-lasting protection.

**Card Capacity and Security:** The card holder should be able to securely hold at least 2-3 cards, accommodating essential IDs and credit cards. The design should prevent cards from easily falling out, even when the case is dropped or shaken. Some cases offer RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) blocking to protect against electronic theft.

The mechanism for accessing the cards should be smooth and reliable, allowing for swift and easy retrieval when needed. The card holder should not add excessive bulk to the case, maintaining a relatively slim profile. Diffrent card holder designs exist, including sliding compartments, snap-on covers, and wallet-style flaps, each offering varying levels of security and convenience.

**Design and Aesthetics:** While functionality is vital, the case should also complement the iPhone 14 Pro's design. Slim and sleek profiles are preferred, avoiding unnecessary bulk. A variety of colors and finishes should be available to match individual preferences.

The design should also consider ergonomics,ensuring a pleasant grip and easy access to all phone features. Some cases offer textured surfaces for enhanced grip, reducing the risk of accidental drops. The overall aesthetic should be clean and professional, suitable for both casual and formal settings.

**Wireless Charging Compatibility:** Many users rely on wireless charging, so the case should be compatible with Qi wireless charging technology.The case thickness and material should not interfere with the charging signal.

Cases that are not compatible with wireless charging can be inconvenient, requiring users to remove the case every time they want to charge wirelessly. Wireless charging compatibility is a crucial feature for seamless integration with modern charging habits. Some cases are specifically designed to optimize wireless charging efficiency, ensuring faster charging times.

1mpotq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mpotq7/aita_for_expecting_my_future_bil_to_apologize_and/,AITA for expecting my future BIL to apologize and respect my boundaries?,"I, 30 F and 32 M boyfriend of about a year and a half now live together with his mom and brother. His twin brother recently moved back in after being gone for a little over a year, so we did not live together when he was still at the house. When he moved back in, there was a slight adjustment since my bf and I basically had our own space for a while. I mostly do the cooking for the house and cleaning duties - my bf helps whenever I ask. 

Since his brother moved back in, I have continued to do all those things. I clean our shared bathroom, wash the towels for our bathroom and cook/ clean most of the time due to my bf and I having different work schedules. I somewhat expected the brother to help or take some of the responsibilities off of us, considering he was not currently working. I began to stop expecting anything from him and my bf and I continued to do things ourselves, despite my bf asking him to occasionally help out, to which his response most of the time was that he was busy (aka gaming or sleeping). 

He then started to do things that made me actually mad - he ignored texts from his mom asking him to do things, which then had to be taken care of by my bf or myself. 

He started coming into our room and taking clothes from our closet bc he was too lazy to wash his or just wanted to wear my bfs clothes - without asking most times. (This mainly bothered me bc I have purchased some of the clothes he was taking and didn’t really care if he was taking things my bf no longer wore / I didn’t buy). 

Mf bf also had set up a mini fridge where I keep my coffee set up and other drinks. He started drinking some of the sodas / waters I would buy and by the time I would go to get one, there would be only 1-2 left from the pack of 6+. My bf nicely asked him if he had been drinking them to which he defensively responded that he had a couple/ few and if they were “off limits”? All my bf asked was for him to ask if he could have one before just taking them or assuming I wouldn’t mind, considering I was the one who purchased them. He then proceeded to go off on a rant about purchasing his own groceries and not letting us have any. (His mom and my bf and I purchase all of the groceries & he currently doesn’t help financially, which I understand isn’t possible.) 

Just a couple of weeks ago, I went to dinner with my bf’s mom and stopped to pick up food for both him and his brother on the way home. I brought my leftovers from the restaurant home and after he ate the food I brought for him, he also ate my left overs without asking and saw nothing wrong with it. He ended up apologizing the next morning after my bf had to explain why that wasn’t cool. 

To put the cherry on top, he just did what I believe is his FIRST load of laundry since moving back in, back in May (due to him getting a new job.) He had left his clothes in the dryer the night before, to which I politely put back in his basket the next day so I could do our own laundry. I washed one of my fav shirts that I purchased for my bf (to which he’s previously borrowed, once asking, and then again w/o asking and then not returning and what sparked my bf to ask him to not take clothes that I’ve purchased). I hung the shirt on a hanger to air dry and this morning I woke up to him walking out the door wearing said shirt (without asking AGAIN). I immediately told my bf something bc I couldn’t believe that he would do that, considering that same shirt is what had been previously talked about. 

* to clarify, I have always funneled my complaints about his brother directly to my bf and then he’s told him to not do those things or why I was annoyed or upset, bc he’s told me that he would rather handle any conflict to ensure that his brother did not speak out of line to me. (I prefer this as well, bc I’m not one to try to start something or cause a fight) 

My bf let him know what I was upset about the shirt, to which he responded “yeah I know lol” 

Back and forth happened between my bf and him, to which he basically just made excuses for wearing the shirt bc he didn’t want to come in our room and wake up my bf. I was awake for 20 min before he left, to which he could’ve asked me to either borrow the shirt or wear another one of my bfs shirts instead. He also had just done laundry 2 days prior and had only gone to work 1 day, so he had other shirts to wear rather than the one hanging in the laundry room that wasn’t his. 

He decided to text me to air things out but never apologized. He also essentially claims our difference in household upbringings being the reason I’m not used to “sharing” and has told my bf previously that me being an only child is the reason I think the way I do and complain about the things he does. AITA for expecting him to respect my boundaries and not do things that have already been communicated? 

*I also just want to mention that my bf has done his absolute best at trying to mediate and has always stood up for me and my feelings. 

I’ve included a text script of the text messages he sent me directly - Theo is my bf’s name. 

“I wanna address this since it’s become an issue and I think maybe it’s gone a little too far recently. And I’m in no way saying your opinion isn’t valid but this needs to be brought up. I only have two polos or shirts that can be worn in an office setting. You know this, Theo knows this. This training is only two weeks long. I actually was going to wake up Theo and ask even though he’s SLEEPING for work but I happened to find a shirt hanging in the laundry room so I figured hey waking up someone resting for work is unnecessary in this situation, especially since my brother whom we’ve shared clothes with for over 30 years with no issue would never not say yes to me regarding borrowing a shirt. Theo and I have never liked being woken up prematurely. He knows this and I know this and it’s become a mutual understanding between us. I understand though why you feel the way you do about the clothes because you purchased them for him. But I am starting to think your concern goes beyond a place of mutual respect and consideration for convenience. I know you have no issues waking theo up even though he’s asleep but between him and I it’s just something we don’t do. So I guess the only solution to make you happy would be for me to barge in. Wake him up and ask him EVERY TIME I need a shirt? I just want to make sure that’s clear and that’s what you want.

Because just frankly I think that’s pretty ridiculous but you know we come from different households. We’re siblings and even beyond that we’re twins which is a different ball game, you grew up not sharing with anyone. I feel like I just want a little empathy in that regard. 

But if there’s no way around it and you want me to barge in every time I need something I will. You know you can talk to me you don’t have to send all of your issues through my brother. 

I’m a person, and we’re gonna be in laws one day. 

Make me understand what exactly you expect and want from your own words. 

Because apparently you think everything I do is simply to piss you off and that’s just ridiculous and completely un true. “

So please let me know if I’m the ass hole or being over dramatic. Yes, I know moving out is an option - that’s not the point of the post lol. ",1,1755140154.0,AITAH,5,0.67,False

I feel rude barging into the discord like hey help!! 

Preface: My anxiety has been thru the roof. I have chronic ptsd (who doesn’t lol) and my landlord has issues w me but attacked my boyfriend over them, and almost barged into my home and I had to move back in w my bf. my social anxiety has been thru the roof. I have been going thru it for 2 years straight. I’m not what happens to me but I’m still barely functioning right now and thank God for streaming no funny shit. I’m still camming on SM thankfully. 

I sought help a few posts ago and building a routine for Sm has helped me. I wake up, shower, stream, break. But this week I’ve been struggling with my routine. 

My issues for help/advice: 

CB is high energy so I’ve been doing it less lately. SM brings me more hourly compared to CB where sometimes it’s hit/miss unless I grind for 4 hours and it’s way more than I expect to earn sometimes.

 The thing is, realistically my boyfriend has a job with long hours and physical labor. He’s reassured me it’s ok if I cam but I literally see him unable to sleep until I end stream. In good conscience I can’t stream that late on CB which were my golden hours. Do I just shelf CB until I get my own housing, or try different hours at least for a little bit? It used to be my bread and butter but lately it’s been SM. 

I built a following on CB and I feel so bad not following thru the schedule I WANT TO DO because of restrictions beyond my control. I know I could stream still and disturb my bf’s sleep but idk. What would you do? I have 25k followers on CB and I feel so stupid just slowing the momentum but I don’t know how to proceed with scheduling. Meanwhile I’ve maintained a schedule of sorts on streammate for the past few weeks since the incident with my landlord and it’s been working. 

I’m so stressed out. I loveeee camming and what I do, being unable to have my own space and my own hours where I feel free enough to yap and jump around, create content on a fast pace and upload— its getting to me. I barely have space in my bf’s room, my tripod is downstairs in the basement god knows where. I’m sucking up being uncomfortable and trying to do what I can, how I can. 

 Should I try to build on top of CB with a morning schedule or in between my SM? (I try to stream 2x/day) 

Another piece of advice if anyone has: been adjusting to psych meds for 2 months now!!! Don’t want to specify in case it’s against rules (bipolar med). Still so sleepy without coffee. I feel so anxious since everything happened, we have coffee in the house I’m free and invited to make which would help. But I don’t feel comfortable around his family. I’ve asked my bf to have dinner with them sometime. How do I just rip the bandaid off and get myself food and coffee when I need???? How do i function because my therapist is quite literally no help and my psych says she’s better than a waiting list with no specific time guarantee.  ",1,1755140075.0,CamGirlProblems,5,1.0,False

About me:

Most importantly, I am an ambivert and a cat person. I love to parallel play with my loved ones on a quiet afternoon, but I also like to go out a few times a week to a nice restaurant, my local dive, or a coffee shop. 

I love live music and have been to one or two shows a month since the beginning of this year. Some of my favorite genres are indie rock, Midwest emo, and pop. 

I like to read, craft, and bake in my free time. I'm getting back into writing, too. 

About you:

A creative, funny, and also a cat person. I want someone who is empathetic and politically progressive left. I get along best with people who are quick-witted, independent thinkers, and open to learning new things. 

My usual type is tall & brown-haired, but I am open if you can make me laugh, are a great cook, or can send me good book recommendations. A nice smile doesn't hurt either.

Nice but not necessary:

-Niche hobby
-Plays an instrument
-Studied humanities
-Has tattoos

About us:

I am ideally looking for someone who is ready for a long term relationship. I am in a place in life where I have everything I need and am very happy. I love my career, my friendships, have hobbies that interest and excite me, and am content spending time alone. 

I want someone who feels the same about their life, who wants to find ways to add to each other's lives.

Characters.
Name: Lilienne Ivy Glass
Age: 21
Birthdate: Oct 18 2004
Gender: F

Profile Characteristics 

Personality:  Shy, Quiet, Socially awkward, paranoid, creative (artsy), romantic daydreamer, stubborn

Likes: Lilacs, rainy nights, storms, bunnies, reading, painting, soft music, punk rock music, loyalty

Dislikes: dishonesty, artificial lighting, the smell of gasoline, crowded areas, silence so deep its heavy, sudden changes with no time to prepare

Hobbies: collecting flowers/ pressing them in books, baking simple recipes, journaling, going to thrift stores/ book stores and or flea markets.

Backstory:
Lilienne grew up in a small apartment above a laundromat, the hum of machines and the scent of detergent was her constant. Her father, a mechanic with a tired smile, raised her and her three siblings alone after their mother died giving birth to the youngest. In the chaos of the city, their home was heaven. mismatched mugs on the table, the crackle of an old radio, the sound of rain tapping against the kitchen window.
She was quiet but stubborn, a romantic daydreamer who filled sketchbooks with the colors and shapes she wished the world would see. School was a place she excelled at with little to no effort. By the time she stood at the podium as valedictorian, her voice trembling, she believed the path ahead was hers to shape. Art galleries, travel, a name whispered in admiration.
College was only an hour’s drive away, just across the city, but it might as well have been in another world. That’s where she met him. The boy who called her “his little artist,” who at first made her laugh, then made her flinch. His disapproval arrived in quiet doses.. a raised eyebrow at her paintings, a sigh when she stayed up sketching all night. Over time, it became sharper. Louder. His hands, once warm, turned into something that left marks she hid under sweaters, even in the summer heat.
The night she left, she didn’t tell him. She didn’t tell anyone. She packed her brushes and canvases first, clothes second, and caught the earliest bus west. She told herself she wasn’t running, just.. starting over. A smaller neighborhood, quiet streets, an old house with peeling paint. She didn’t know yet who might be watching from the shadows of those streets. She didn’t know yet how often she’d find the same man at the coffee shop, in the corner of a bookstore, or across the produce aisle…

Gender: M

Backstory: 
Silas grew up in a small quiet town, where appearance mattered more than truth. His father was around, but he was cold, distant and very strict. His mother was timid, fragile and very frail. The kind of woman to put on a smile even through the roughest terrain. Growing up he was like every other young boy. Happy and playful, a real jokester. But into his teen hood he began to change, he wouldn't say for the worse but definitely not for the better if you asked others around him. He began to blend into the background, remembering people's routines without realizing. Who took which bus after school, where they liked to sit, their habits during breaks or lunch. What made them smile. He began to feel off from his peers, not having the biggest emotions towards friends or family. Besides his mother of course. He had his first love at the age of 16. But that ended after only a few short months. She was scared of him, the things he'd say or do. She told him he knew more about her than she knew herself. So she broke things off which caused him to spiral. He got into fights in and out of school constantly when he noticed someone getting close to his love. To the point he got expelled, the only high school in Silverbriar BC, he decided to move out after his fathers constant drinking and torment. Leaving his mother behind yet he still regrets not bringing her with him. One rainy night Silas was sitting outside on the steps of “Ivory & Ash” his knuckles split and bleeding. Silas was found by Evie Macken, the widowed owner. She brought him inside, offered him tea and a job carrying heavy things in and out of the store. The quiet shop gave him peace at last. Ivory & Ash became more than just a job. Through Evie's connections, some clients brought in rare and even unregistered antiques tied to the darker corners of the town and beyond. When jobs needed to be done, Evie would give Silas a signal by leaving an ivory horse figurine on the top of the cash register, allowing him to ‘handle things’ others wouldn't dare to deal with or even want to be associated with. The shop's locked back room doubled as a safe haven for Silas, to store tools, or stash items collected on the ‘job’. The second hand goods provided a perfect cover to move stolen valuables through Evie's network.

Profile Appearance

Appearance: Silas has pale ghostly skin as he barely sees the light of day. Thick dark brown almost black hair that slightly drapes into his face, his hairstyle like a modern greaser without any product. He has a neck tattoo of a raven flying, its head wrapped around his neck and its wings/ body on his shoulder. He has an eyebrow slit on his left eye which he decided to do the day he memorized Lilienne's face seeing her beauty mark. Deep brown eyes narrow and animalistic with a sense of calm in his face. A little scary on his upper lip causing his lips to always be a tiny bit parted.

Build: Silas is 6 '2 and relatively fit. A muscular natural build with patchwork tattoos ranging from his chest, back, waist and his right arm and hands.

Clothing Style: Prefers dark, well-fitted clothing; black wool coats, worn leather jackets, cuffed sleeves showing forearm tattoos. Crisp, button-down shirts. Heavy boots, even in the rain. Always dresses with intention.. ‘nothing is careless.’

Favourite Color: Lilac purple, black, deep blue

Aesthetic: Dim streetlamps in the rain, cigarette smoke curling in cold air, rough hands resting on old wood, pressed lilac petals between the pages of an antique book.

Materialistic likes: Ivory chess pieces, old pocket watches, fountain pens, vintage revolvers, leather-bound journals, rare pressed flowers.

Voice and mannerisms: Speaks in a low, even tone. rarely raises his voice. Often tilts his head slightly when studying someone, as if dissecting every detail.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

So what should I do now? Any way to make this less bad? Do you think the box store will take back half a set? Idk I love the couch but it feels like a lot. Still need to put our end tables, coffee table, and a console table back in this room. 

I’m worried about Xmas and where to put a tree plus accessing the window is more difficult now. My wife loves to read tho and I know she likes the idea of sitting by this window. But I think we could do better.

My mom and I have had a rocky relationship for most of my life. She's rude, narcissistic, mentally and emotionally abusive, fights over absolutely everything, and just kind of a bad person? I don't know, I feel bad thinking it and worse typing it. This is gonna be long, but here we go Reddit!

I told my mother recently that I was planning on moving out to live with my boyfriend in about a year/year and a half. This will give me time to save from my current job and him time to save as well. 

For some reason, I genuinely don't know why, she thinks she'll be moving with us. Ask me 6 months ago and I would have been fine with it, ask me now, and I'm very hesitant. (I would also like to mention my boyfriend said he'd prefer the two of us but would back me up no matter my choice about her living with us) She's disabled (she still has full motion, can walk, do basic chores, that sort of thing) and doesn't have an income outside of SSI benefits. She doesn't do anything around the house, despite being able to at least help a little bit every day. She has baskets of clothes everywhere, moldy dishes in her room, papers, bottles, and a bunch of other shit all over the place. She's told me she will hit my children (when I have them, currently childless) told me I can't wear white to my wedding, told me what to name my children, has told me she wants to hurt me physically but won't, tells me how to spend my money, yells at me daily, has told me what people and pets I'm allowed to have in my home, she makes fun of my boyfriend, she tells me what I can and can't do with my cat, she took pictures of me in short shorts and a sports bra freshman year of high school so she could see how my body changed as I aged, she has said if we weren't related she would want to have sex with me, and she ditched me at work because she ""just sat down to eat"" when I was 16 (it was dark, cold, and scary) then did the same thing when was 18 and there was literally snow and ice everywhere. This isn't everything she's done, but I'm trying to give context. 

The breaking point was a few days ago. We got into a fight about politics. She asked why democrats only vote for democrats (and vise versa for republicans) and when I explained why that usually was, she flipped the fuck out screaming that it didn't make any sense and was stupid and shouldn't be that way. Preach I guess but I have no control over American politics. Then she said my boyfriend's cat couldn't live with us because her cats wouldn't like him. I said ""his cat will never be here don't worry"" and she looked confused, saying she thought his cat would go with him when we moved. I said ""his cat will but I don't have time in my life for this, for you acting like this"" and she went off saying I was a horrible person and I wanted to watch her fail. I don't, but if thats what it takes for her to realize that this is wrong and I won't tolerate it, I guess I'll pour myself some coffee and watch. 

I donate blood, I work 16 hour days, I help in soup kitchens for the homeless, I help out at animal shelters, I pay over half the rent and everything else. I'm not a bad person, I'm just wondering if I'm out of line for what I said, for not allowing her in my future home, or around my future children without supervision.

I’ve been diving headfirst into starting my own specialty coffee roasting business. So far I’ve got my **LLC**, **EIN**, a **business bank account**, and a pretty amazing setup for testing — including an Aillio Bullet R2 Pro.

The deeper I get into this, the more daunting it feels. I’m doing this solo, and while I’ve gotten plenty of criticism, I haven’t gotten much guidance. I’m *not* chasing big money — my motivation is to share my love of specialty coffee with others. It truly changed my life, and I want to be able to share that with my community.

My plan is to **operate out of my garage** for now, roasting small batches for friends, family, coworkers, and local connections. Long term, I’d love to make it a community thing — getting local roasters involved, offering package deals for coffee retailers, and building a website where people can find local coffee in one place or discover new coffee spots.

The local specialty coffee scene here is *quiet* — but I think it has real potential.

**Here’s where I’m stuck:**  
I’m new to business ownership and have no idea exactly what permits, licenses, or other requirements I need here (Fairfax County, VA). I’d also love to hear if anyone has advice on running a micro-roastery from home.

If anyone here is familiar with coffee roasting in Virginia — or just small business in general — I’d really appreciate your advice, experiences, or even just encouragement.

Thanks in advance!

Name: Lilienne Ivy Glass
Age: 21
Birthdate: Oct 18 2004
Gender: F

Profile Characteristics 

Personality:  Shy, Quiet, Socially awkward, paranoid, creative (artsy), romantic daydreamer, stubborn

Likes: Lilacs, rainy nights, storms, bunnies, reading, painting, soft music, punk rock music, loyalty

Dislikes: dishonesty, artificial lighting, the smell of gasoline, crowded areas, silence so deep its heavy, sudden changes with no time to prepare

Quirks/Habits: twirls a strand of hair when lost in thought/ daydreaming, avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks, keeps her tea half full for hours as she tends to get distracted easily.

Hobbies: collecting flowers/ pressing them in books, baking simple recipes, journaling, going to thrift stores/ book stores and or flea markets.

Backstory:
Lilienne grew up in a small apartment above a laundromat, the hum of machines and the scent of detergent was her constant. Her father, a mechanic with a tired smile, raised her and her three siblings alone after their mother died giving birth to the youngest. In the chaos of the city, their home was heaven. mismatched mugs on the table, the crackle of an old radio, the sound of rain tapping against the kitchen window.
She was quiet but stubborn, a romantic daydreamer who filled sketchbooks with the colors and shapes she wished the world would see. School was a place she excelled at with little to no effort. By the time she stood at the podium as valedictorian, her voice trembling, she believed the path ahead was hers to shape. Art galleries, travel, a name whispered in admiration.
College was only an hour’s drive away, just across the city, but it might as well have been in another world. That’s where she met him. The boy who called her “his little artist,” who at first made her laugh, then made her flinch. His disapproval arrived in quiet doses.. a raised eyebrow at her paintings, a sigh when she stayed up sketching all night. Over time, it became sharper. Louder. His hands, once warm, turned into something that left marks she hid under sweaters, even in the summer heat.
The night she left, she didn’t tell him. She didn’t tell anyone. She packed her brushes and canvases first, clothes second, and caught the earliest bus west. She told herself she wasn’t running, just.. starting over. A smaller neighborhood, quiet streets, an old house with peeling paint.

1mpomtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/1mpomtr/automate_espresso_machine_but_which/,Automate espresso machine… but which?,"There’s various posts, in this sub and elsewhere, about automating coffee machines. The idea is simple:
• Connect the coffee machine to a smart plug.
• Leave the machine’s power switch on.
• When your automation runs — for example, after you dismiss your wake-up alarm — the smart plug turns on and coffee is served.

I did just that for my Moccamaster, a drip coffee machine usually recommended by these posts for automation, and it works great!

Of course, at the end of the automation, the coffee machine has to then *stop* making coffee. This is not a problem for most drip coffee machines (including the Moccamaster) since they’ll stop on their own. But I’m thinking of switching from drip coffee to espresso. So I’m wondering which espresso machine both (1) is switch-based, not button-based, so I can automate it using a smart plug; and (2) will stop pouring coffee on its own. 

My possibly incorrect understanding is that most switch-based espresso machines will make espresso until the switch is flipped off. Or, at least, that’s what I gathered from the instruction video for the Gaggia Classic Pro.

Most videos of automated espresso machines I’ve seen so far use a button-based espresso machine and a SwitchBot button pusher. So if I go this alternate route I’d have to get a SwitchBot button busher + the hub so I can use it through HomeKit. Which also works, of course, it just might not be the ideal solution.

Anyway, has anyone had any success automating an espresso machine? Any tips are appreciated. Thanks!!",0,1755139591.0,HomeKit,0,0.5,False

My go-to recipe is the 210ml-15g-2min one, and I just tweak the steep time (either 3, 5, or 8) if I want different notes/profiles (eg 8mins give me more nuance, 3 and 5 for more kick and body). 

That said - I usually have two of those.

- Does it make sense to use 30g with 210ml while brewing, then just add the 210ml after brewing?
- Won't the smaller water column (proportion-wise) mean there's less extraction happening (and/or I'm just wasting beans since there's less water per gram of coffee)? 
- with these amounts, does it mean I have to steep for 5mins minimum to get the same amount of extraction? 

Thanks!

Selling my **Varia VS6** grinder plus the Supernova Gold flat burrs, and the Kilonova DLC flat burrs. Stock flat burrs are also included.

Looking to get **$700** for all items together, with local pickup preferable since it’s a bulky and heavy item. 

Condition is great - about 25lbs of coffee total, with no operation issues. Makes great filter coffee, and cleaning/burr swap is a breeze. Selling due to upgrading my grinder (hopefully my last upgrade). 

Feel free to PM with questions or offers!

Why do people do this...","For the past few years I've been looking for a multi-unit property in Chicago's Logan Square neighborhood. It's a neighborhood full of historic buildings, deep rooted cultures, vibrant restaurants and independent coffee shops. On the flip side, however, this also means its attracted hoards of real estate development and 'luxury' seeking clientele. I've seen flip after flip of architecturally significant buildings turned into tasteless white and grey boxes. These ""developers"" will rip out all of the original wood trim, stained glass, built-ins, mosaic tiles, wood doors, hardware, etc. The list goes on...

Today, I stumbled across this landmark 'two-flat', Chicago slang for a multi-unit building with two units. It was put on the market for the the first time in over 50 years (in 2017) and sold for $950K. Low and behold, just like the thousands of others before it, it was listed this week for $1.875M without any of its original character and charm. Literally every original aspect of it has been thoughtlessly ripped out and replaced with 'x, y, and z' from aisle 12 at Home Depot. I don't understand how anyone with the slightest bit of critical thinking skills would buy this building back in 2017 and decide to follow through with destroying it.

I’ve been diving headfirst into starting my own specialty coffee roasting business. So far I’ve got my **LLC**, **EIN**, a **business bank account**, and a pretty amazing setup for testing — including an Aillio Bullet R2 Pro.

The deeper I get into this, the more daunting it feels. I’m doing this solo, and while I’ve gotten plenty of criticism, I haven’t gotten much guidance. I’m *not* chasing big money — my motivation is to share my love of specialty coffee with others. It truly changed my life, and I want to be able to share that with my community.

My plan is to **operate out of my garage** for now, roasting small batches for friends, family, coworkers, and local connections. Long term, I’d love to make it a community thing — getting local roasters involved, offering package deals for coffee retailers, and building a website where people can find local coffee in one place or discover new coffee spots.

The local specialty coffee scene here is *quiet* — but I think it has real potential.

**Here’s where I’m stuck:**  
I’m new to business ownership and have no idea exactly what permits, licenses, or other requirements I need here (Fairfax County, VA). I’d also love to hear if anyone has advice on running a micro-roastery from home.

If anyone here is familiar with coffee roasting in Virginia — or just small business in general — I’d really appreciate your advice, experiences, or even just encouragement.

Shortly after they split she moved on with someone else and they've been together since as well. 

The reason for this post is that she will not stop stalking us. We've moved 3 times and every time she finds out where we live. From mutual acquaintances we find out that she knows all sorts of life events, even though my husband never posts on his social media (His last post was 2 years ago and it was a general meme share) and I don't even have any social media accounts. She makes comments to people about how she misses him and regrets breaking up with him, specifically to people who she knows will tell us about it. It's like she wants to find a way to reach out in hopes of rekindling the relationship. It's this part specifically that is so desperate and sad to me, as she has a long term partner and according to these mutual acquaintances, she has made these comments in front of him. It's also sad for her boyfriend to be with someone who is openly pining for their ex. 

Neither of us have confronted her or asked her to stop being a creep, because it will only fuel the fire. According to mutual acquaintances, former friends of hers, and my husband she would love knowing that she is creeping us out and buckle down ever harder, like a child seeing they got a reaction so they continue the behavior.  But it's just becoming so annoying, I have no fear of her, she's not dangerous, just pathetic and obsessive, as she's been doing this for 4 years now. There are no grounds for a restraining order, as she doesn't do anything with the information, just makes it known that she knows about our lives to people she knows will tell us. For example, running into my husbands ex coworker, telling him that she knows about A,B,&C because she knows that he will then call my husband and tell him about the weird stuff she said. 

I'm shocked that this is even happening at our age, this is middle school level drama. 

Any advice on how to deal with this situation is much appreciated. We've kept our heads down for years, stayed quiet, been careful who and what we shared with, and honestly shrunk our lives in an effort to get away from her, but she will not let up. I don't understand her obsession, or ways to get her to leave us alone. We're honestly quiet, keep to ourselves, work, schools, daily routines type of people.

1mpoeeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1mpoeeg/la_fortunamonteverde_itinerary_tips_during_rainy/,La Fortuna/Monteverde itinerary + tips during rainy season!,"hi all, my husband and i just got back from a 8 day trip to CR - we loved it! Here's what we ended up doing, where we stayed, and some tips.

**1. Day 1: Arrive in San Jose -> La Fortuna**

\- Our hotel helped us arrange a pickup from the SJO airport. Unfortunately, it took over an hour to get through customs so our driver was waiting for quite a while! He was awesome and we were sure to give him a big tip.

\- We stayed at [Hotel Kokoro](https://kokoro.hotelsinalajuela.com/en/?from=2025-08-14&to=2025-08-15&adults=2&children=0&clirder=1), which was gorgeous. The grounds are so lush and there's a lot to explore - there's mineral springs on site, a pool, a frog pond, and a small hiking trail. We loved just walking around. Their breakfast offering was really tasty, I looked forward to it every morning. They also offered a dinner buffet for an additional cost, which we did when we arrived because we were so tired and hungry. The hotel staff is really kind and helpful. Its a family run place. The cabins have an old-school rustic feel (all wood interiors) and I thought they were very charming! We ended up with a beautiful view of the Arenal volcano from our front step.

**2. Day 2: La Fortuna**

\- We started the day with a coffee/cacao tour at [North Fields,](https://www.northfieldscr.com/tour/) which was great! The tour lasted about 2.5-3 hours in total. The tour takes you throughout their entire facility and there are different 'stations' along the way where they'll demonstrate things or pass around samples. We sampled multiple different kinds of coffee, cacao fruit, sugarcane juice, and chocolates of all different levels (60-90% cocoa). Our tour guide was really informative and friendly. It was very sunny for our tour but there's coverage in the huts and some of the activities are indoors, so you could do it on a rainier day.

\- We visited the [La Fortuna Waterfall](https://www.cataratalafortuna.com/) in the afternoon and it was POURING. We got completely drenched, but it was still fun. It takes about 15 mins to hike down to the viewpoint and 30 mins to hike back up. We bought tickets day-of.

\- We had dinner in town at Organico which was pretty tasty! We capped off the day with an impromptu couples massage at Kinereth. We were able to walk in and be seen quickly, but if you're after a particular time, I'd call in advance.

**3. Day 3: La Fortuna**

**-** We started the day with a hike on the Las Coladas trail on the [Arenal 1968](https://arenalvolcanopark.com/parks/arenal-volcano-park/) paths. The weather held and we got there and back without getting rained on! We also saw a coati in the parking lot and an eyelash pit viper on our walk back.

\- Since the weather was holding up, we beelined it to [Mistico Hanging Bridges ](https://misticopark.com/)and also felt lucky to make it through the whole thing without drizzles! We managed to see a poison dart frog on the way out, but otherwise didn't catch much wildlife. The bridges are pretty cool.

\- We booked a night reservation + dinner at [EcoTermales.](https://arenalvolcanopark.com/tours/eco-termales-hot-springs-2/) We were warned at our hotel not to dunk our heads underwater at any hot spring, especially not a mineral spring, so we didn't, but we ran into someone the next day who was freaking out because she was doing handstands underwater and stuff. so...don't do that! It was busy, but not packed, so we were able to go between pools without having to wait. Dinner has a ton of different types of food available and it's buffet style as well. It wasn't my favorite, but it was convenient. The watermelon and pineapple juice was pretty solid. The facility is nice, the waterfalls in the super hot pools are pretty relaxing, and its a good time if you wanna just chill out and soak with a cocktail in your hand.

**4. Day 4: La Fortuna -> Monteverde**

\- We booked a Jeep/Boat/Jeep ride to Monteverde through [Arenal Rides](https://arenalrides.com/). A lot of people here recommend Carlos and I could see why! He was awesome and really responsive. One person asked 'wait, its not a jeep?' so again, feels worth noting that it's more like van/boat/van, but that's not really important. All three rides were efficient and quick. I was impressed with how well our driver navigated the craggy roads in Monteverde. They also stopped for a break so people could get a snack/use the bathroom.

\- We stayed at [Natura hotel](https://naturahotelmonteverde.com/) which was great for our needs. Initially we were like 'oh no there's no AC!' but we didn't miss it. There was a fan in our room which was helpful. The hotel staff and I communicated on Whatsapp if/when we needed something and they were great with helping us get rides to some of our activities. We had breakfast there every day, which they sent us options for the night before and asked us to choose.

\- We ate at Orchid Cafe which was AWESOME. Would totally go back. We stopped by Cafe Monteverde afterwards for coffee and it was delicious. We hailed a cab at the taxi depot out front and it was very quick and painless.

\- We got a couples massage at the [Monteverde Massage Center](https://monteverdemassagecenter.com/about-massage-center), booked through Whatsapp. It was sooooo good. My legs were so sore from all the hikes and the two massage therapists were incredible. Yolanda found every single knot and was an absolute sweetheart.

**5. Day 5: Monteverde**

\- We started the day with a guided tour of [Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve](https://cloudforestmonteverde.com/home/). We booked directly through the preserve, so we were assigned a guide at random. It's crazy how knowledgeable the guides are and how they can sense whether wildlife is nearby. We were lucky to see a coati, lots of birds, a cool millipede, an agouti, and a walking stick bug.

\- We had lunch at Soda Shangri-la, which was SO good. The black bean empanada will haunt me forever. The casado was fantastic and the whole meal was super affordable.

\- We ended the day with a night walk at the [Wildlife Refuge](https://refugiomonteverdecr.com/) (also booked through the preserve). There was a shuttle that took us there and back included in the price. Our guide was great and so determined to find all different kinds of creatures. He also offered to take photos through his scope and our group shared them with each other so we all got kickass high res pics. We saw a sloth feeding her baby, a porcupine, a walking stick bug, a leaf mimic katydid, a snail eater snake, a green pit viper, some wolf spiders (nope), a toucan, a green parrot, a few other birds, a meadow tree frog, and a red eyed frog. It ruled.

**6. Day 6: Monteverde**

\- We intentionally left the day open to just explore as we saw fit. We had brunch at Orchid Cafe again, coffee at Cafe Monteverde, and just took it easy.

\- We had a later dinner reservation booked at [San Lucas ](https://sanlucas.cr/menusanlucas/ingles.pdf)so we tried to stay hungry until we arrived. It was a 9 course menu, definitely the fanciest and most involved 'dining experience' we've ever had. Each course is themed around one of the provinces (with 2 courses themed around Monteverde, first and last). You can tell that everyone working there is really passionate about what they do and wants to make sure you have a great meal. The setting is beautiful, you get an amazing view of the city, and the meal was really tasty. They took our photo and gave us a copy as well as a 'passport', a copy of our menu, and a little bag of coffee from a local vendor.

**7. Day 7: Monteverde -> San Jose**

\- We had breakfast at the hotel and then it was time to go back to San Jose! We booked a private transfer through Arenal Rides (Carlos is the best!!!) and our driver was such a nice guy. He pointed out lots of lovely views along the way and was a very smooth, skilled driver. I was sure to give him a big tip when we arrived in San Jose.

\- We picked a hotel by the airport just for convenience and stayed at the Marriott. The hotel restaurant was surprisingly great?? I ordered a casado and asked for it without meat and they took extra care with my meal to add some falafel bites and tofu in addition to the usual offerings. It was really good! Breakfast was also solid.

\- We met a friend in town in San Jose for dinner at a vegan restaurant, Sokko Happy Food - it was a little tricky to get an Uber but we managed to find one! Dinner was decent and well priced.

**8. Day 8: Leave San Jose**

\- Our hotel offered a free shuttle to the airport every 15 minutes, which we took advantage of. I have to say, the San Jose airport is INCREDIBLY efficient on the departures end. We went from front door to our gate in 20 minutes. A pretty smooth trip all things considered.

Rainy season tips:

* If you're traveling in the rainy season, bring a dry bag!!!!! You won't need it on the lighter drizzle times, but when the rain is hard, it is HARD and your devices/valuables WILL get wet.
* If you have a waterproof bag - not water resistant - I'd bring it as well. I used this [Osprey day pack](https://www.osprey.com/ultralight-dry-stuff-pack-drypkul20ls23-550?size=O%2FS&color=Waterfront+Blue&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=2024-03-01_kw_na_travel_na_multi_osp_travel_na_na_na_multi_na_na_na_na_dtc_na_na&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20554262788&gbraid=0AAAAADDMh1qzGpb95Xg6xcLxCwdW90_YA&gclid=CjwKCAjw7_DEBhAeEiwAWKiCC9ccyYxuqYLNEDuQkbrKcXY5eRVG396D52y6EvY04Ss-B8e-ohb88xoCLmwQAvD_BwE) and put the dry bag inside. Everything stayed dry!
* A waterproof - again, not water resistant - rainjacket is a must. We put our rain jackets in our backpacks every time we left the house.
* Bring a backup pair of closed toe shoes in case yours get drenched. We didn't have a great way for my husband to dry his first pair out and it took all week for them to finally dry. I brought Tevas and my running shoes, and I made it out ok!
* Pack something for wet clothes - whether its just a plastic bag, a ziploc, etc - its worth it to have on hand for going between destinations.

General tips:

* If you're not renting a car, you can get around La Fortuna with Ubers. There is no Lyft, only Uber. There were plenty of Ubers and they were not very expensive.
* In Monteverde, you cannot use Uber. However, there is a local taxi service (dark red cars) that you can use to get around. There is a taxi depot in downtown Santa Elena (across the street from Cafe Monteverde) but if you need to get a ride, you can ask your hotel/establishment to help you get a taxi.
* In San Jose, you CAN use Ubers. Some areas might take a bit longer than others, but we were able to make it work.
* If you're going to Monteverde pack a sweater/sweatshirt/long sleeve or something and a pair of long pants. It's definitely cooler!
* If you're vegan/can't have dairy, I noticed a lot of places were more likely to carry almond milk than any other type of non dairy milk. If you were lucky, there would be oat or soy, but it seemed less frequent.
* While we didn't get bit by anything, if you're going on a deep hike and bugs tend to like you, I'd definitely pack bug spray. I picked up the OFF! wipes with Deet and they worked great. We didn't get bit once!
* When your tours say 'wear long pants' or 'wear closed toed shoes' - please heed their advice! We saw a couple of people show up in shorts and get bit by some insect or another. Our guide also was clear that we should let him hike ahead and follow behind so he could scout ahead for any animals on the trail or anything dangerous. Don't go off script!
* If there's a particular animal or sight you want to see - do some research ahead of time to find out when or where you might be able to spot it. Showing up on a daytime tour expecting to see a nocturnal animal is kind of a dick move.
* Eat at sodas if and when you can! They're super awesome and great value for money!
* If you're planning to use cash I'd carry around a mix of dollars and colones. Some places only took one or the other. We used cards if/when we could, but between my husband and I we always made sure one of us had at least 5000 colones on hand.
* I saw/see a lot of posts on here about safety - never once did I feel unsafe. I've lived in New York my whole life, so I have a pretty good idea of how to conduct myself and not get my shit rocked, but nobody approached us or tried anything shady. We stowed our valuables in our hotel rooms like we do on all of our trips, and it was totally fine. 
* I had a very silly preconceived notion that in the deeper areas there would be bugs everywhere and spiders galore - I only saw them at night, and sparingly. I'm very arachnophobic so I was nervous about this, but there was nothing to fear. When we spotted wolf spiders on our night tour, I just steered clear and pulled up the hood of my jacket. They're not gonna mess with you. And there were no critters in any of our hotel rooms, save for one or two geckos which were actually kind of cute and funny. You'll be okay! 

It was a fantastic trip. I can't wait to go back and see more, maybe visit Limon and some of the other provinces!",6,1755138916.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False
1mpoe2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1mpoe2s/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_keep_my_relationship/,AITAH for not wanting to keep my relationship with my bf?,"Hello potato family. I have been watching Charlotte's videos for years, but never have I thought to be the one writing. I'm sorry in advance if I don't make perfect sense that English is not my first language nor my second. And buckle up this will be a looooong one. 

First some context:

I (35f) am from an Asian country and work in a government organization for 5 years. At work I am kinda famous for the girl who never date coworkers. It is one of my principals. (important for later) Well, fast forward 3 years ago I met a guy (50m) at work who is 100% my type. I was speechless and I was sure that my heart skipped beat when I saw him. I have never seen a guy like him instead of in my dreams. But I figured he is married due to our age gap. Since then we communicated only professionally. Never out of work hour or anything more than work related subjects. Even though I had a huge crush on him after a year I have stopped having a crush on him. I just respected him professionally and looked up to him. 

Then Last Christmas happened something strange. He texted me wishing a merry Christmas and happy new year. That was so unordinary for him to do. We have never exchanged any wishes for any holidays before. I replied him wishing the same but kept my words short and professional. After new year we worked on the project together. After the team meeting a friend of mine slipped that he divorced his wife due to infidelity. (his wife cheated) I didn't know what I should do with that information. So I just brushed it off. Then one day he asked me to go out with him for a coffee. I said no. I said we are colleagues and that's all. He said it's work related and not a date. And I told him then we should grab a coffee at work, during work hours. He agreed. Couple of days passed and we met up for a coffee at work café. He confessed. He said he saw me before we met. And he just fell in love with me. He said that I was his dream for years. But he never could have made a move on me because of my ""no dating coworker"" thing. He said he was just looking after me from a distance for all these years without my knowledge. But since we started working on this project together he could not maintain the professional communication any longer and he had to confess. I was shocked. And TBH bit happy to know my ex-crush has a crush on me. I told him I appreciate his honesty but I will not engage in any further communication not work related. He told me he understands. And respects my wish. I was crashed to reject him. For the love of god, he is the perfect guy IMO. After that meeting things seemed normal. He was just normal with me at work. Then something started. I started receiving gifts at work via delivery. When I asked the delivery driver who is this gift from the driver always says it’s anonymous. I suspected it could be him but he was just normal just like before. So I was confused. Then the barista of the work café started delivering me my favorite coffee to my office. When I asked her who is it from she just shrugged and said it was from someone who adores you. After second coffee I told her thank you and please do not bring me anymore again. She assured me to not bring coffee again. And it stopped. But the flower and gifts did not stop. Over a month I received so many gifts without knowing the sender. It was exhausting.

And then one Friday when I was leaving work he was outside. He politely told me have a nice weekend. I told him the same. He then asked if I could give him a ride. It was strange that he never asked me such thing before. I asked if it was normal he said yes just a ride. I agreed. He said he was going to one place near my place. Mind you my place is one and half hour away from work. In the beginning of the ride he was just asking my work related questions. And then he slipped “how I liked his gifts? And is wondering why I rejected coffee offers due to I drink a lot of coffee during a day?” I was honest with him. I told him that I suspected that was from him. That’s why I told the barista to not bring me coffee anymore. For the gifts I have no power to reject due to delivery system. He said he just wanted to make sure I drink my favorite coffee and have cute gifts to get me through my tough work day. Then we talked sincerely for the whole ride. It was nice. When we arrived at his destination he asked me out for a proper date. I said yes. During the first date I asked him about his marriage situation. He said he is divorced. And he has a 9 year old boy. I told him to be truly honest with me regarding his marriage. And I asked him to be professional with me at work and separating our relationship from work. He agreed. After two months into our relationship it was just perfect. We were professional colleagues at work. And had a great relationship. We were so similar and compatible that once I thought he might be my soulmate.

He was so careful and thoughtful of me throughout our relationship. He is kind of tough guy at work but well respected. But when he is with me he is so kind and soft with me. He always told me that he is obsessed with me. And he thinks that I am his soulmate. And at that time I thought that’s kinda cute. But after a half year things started to escalate. He started to talk about future. He was really good to me. I told him I feel the same as him and I am seeing a future with him. Then he dropped the bomb. He said he is still in the divorce situation with his wife. I was shocked. I told him that he said he already divorced! He said well he isn’t living with his wife more than a year now. And they have a boy who is 9 now. So they constantly connect with each other regarding of their child. I told him I understand that he has to keep the communication with his wife regarding his child. But if he is not fully divorced yet I don’t feel comfortable to be with him. I told him we should take a break and stay no contact until everything settles. He was crashed but he said he understood where I stand. So we separated. After two weeks he reached out to me saying no contact is killing him. And he already made his decision to divorce his wife long before we started seeing each other. So there is no problem to us continuing our relationship. I told him I feel like an affair partner for him during his divorce. That’s why we need to have a time-out. He said he understands my feeling but wants to have a normal communication with me during this time-out. I told him no. Because if we stayed in contact and not seeing each other feels like a torture for me. He said he will keep our conversation professionally and friendly. Not anything more. I told him we could try. And for another two weeks his messages were normal. Friendly and professional. Occasionally taking care of me. But his work performance drastically dropped. And started to look worn out all the time at work. Then one day he just bombarded me with messages. That he misses me, losing his mind over time-out, cannot concentrate without me. Long story short he was losing it. And I told him if he doesn’t stop texting me more than what we discussed prior I will cut any further contact with him and break up with him then and there. After that text he told me he will try low contact again. Then few days later same thing happened. And now I am not sure anymore. I feel like he is keeping me in hook for feeling guilty for his poor performance at work, and distracting behaver. I am not saying that I am feeling great either. I feel unlucky, less loved, self-doubt after the break. I miss him a lot too. But I am trying to maintain my principle to not to be his side during his divorce procedure.

I am writing this hoping to see any advice what should I do in this circumstance. Also as I was writing this he sent me a voice message of him singing a song about lost love and crying. And he told me I am being too harsh on him and on us. So AITAH for giving not wanting to keep our relationship?",1,1755138891.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False
1mpod7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mpod7p/my_husbands_ex_wont_stop_stalking_us/,My Husbands Ex Won't Stop Stalking Us,"So as in the title me (39F) and my husband (45M) got married earlier this year and have 2 children together. Prior to our relationship he was with this woman (45 ish? F) who I'll refer to as Mary. They were together for 10 years, then we met about a year after they split and we are really happy together. Shortly after they split she moved on with someone else and they've been together since as well. 

The reason for this post is that she will not stop stalking us. We've moved 4 times and every time she finds out where we live. From mutual acquaintances we find out that she knows all sorts of life events, even though my husband never posts on his social media (His last post was 2 years ago and it was a general meme share) and I don't even have any social media accounts. She makes comments to people about how she misses him and regrets breaking up with him, specifically to people who she knows will tell us about it. It's like she wants to find a way to reach out in hopes of rekindling the relationship. It's this part specifically that is so desperate and sad to me, as she has a long term partner and according to these mutual acquaintances, she has made these comments in front of him. It's also sad for her boyfriend to be with someone who is openly pining for their ex. 

Neither of us have confronted her or asked her to stop being a creep, because it will only fuel the fire. According to mutual acquaintances, former friends of hers, and my husband she would love knowing that she is creeping us out and buckle down ever harder, like a child seeing they got a reaction so they continue the behavior.  But it's just becoming so annoying, I have no fear of her, she's not dangerous, just pathetic and obsessive, as she's been doing this for 4 years now. There are no grounds for a restraining order, as she doesn't do anything with the information, just makes it known that she knows about our lives to people she knows will tell us. For example, running into my husbands ex coworker, telling him that she knows about A,B,&C because she knows that he will then call my husband and tell him about the weird stuff she said. 

I'm shocked that this is even happening at our age, this is middle school level drama. 

Any advice on how to deal with this situation is much appreciated. We've kept our heads down for years, stayed quiet, been careful who and what we shared with, and honestly shrunk our lives in an effort to get away from her, but she will not let up. I don't understand her obsession, or ways to get her to leave us alone. We're honestly quiet, keep to ourselves, work, schools, daily routines type of people. There's not even juicy drama to gossip about, big news in our family is finding a new favorite coffee creamer. 

  
Any advice or insight on how to deal with this person and ideally get her to leave us alone would be so so appreciated. ",2,1755138824.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I’m hoping to stick to it for the whole month of September to be able to continue it in my way of life. 

I’ve created a food list and would really appreciate some feedback and if this is a sustainable way to live for at least a month:

Had joint pain and stomach issues since I was 10. Over the years developed multiple food intolerances (now can’t eat wheat, dairy, corn, tomatoes, coffee, chocolate, soy, peanuts). Multiple doctors, normal tests except gastritis. SIBO breath test negative but have all symptoms. Antibiotics once made me feel great temporarily. Now dealing with reflux, bloating, rashes, fatigue, nutrient deficiencies, and joint pain. Insurance won’t cover rifaximin. Looking for others who’ve been through this or found solutions.

-----------------------------------

When I was around 10, I had really bad joint pain (to the point where I could barely walk) and bad stomach problems. My mom took me to a chiropractor who did that weird muscle test where you hold bottles in one hand (with wheat, corn, etc.) and they push down on your arm. If they can push it down, you “react” to that food. After that, I stopped eating wheat and dairy, and my problems went away.

That worked for a while, but as I got older more foods started to bother me again. At 16, a new doctor ran stool tests, parasite checks, autoimmune panels, and thyroid tests — all normal. She gave me antibiotics and for a short time I felt amazing (clear skin, no stomach pain), but at the end of taking them I started getting rashes.

Now I can’t eat wheat, dairy, corn, tomatoes, coffee, chocolate, soy, peanuts, or anything derived from those without feeling awful. Recently, I went to a GI doctor who did a colonoscopy and endoscopy, and the only finding was gastritis. SIBO breath test was negative (even though I have all the symptoms). She wants to try rifaximin, but my insurance rejected it and it’s $2000 out of pocket.

My current symptoms:

Acid reflux & heartburn Gas, bloating, burping Food intolerances/sensitivities Stomach pain, cramping, nausea Diarrhea & constipation Itchy rashes & acne Fatigue Slight weight gain Joint pain Headaches Nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin D, B12, magnesium, etc.)

I feel like I’m slowly losing the ability to eat almost anything without a reaction, and no one can tell me why. I'm starting to get desperate, and pretty much only eat chicken, rice, and potatoes at this point. And they have to be completely plain or it bothers my gastritis or one of my food intolerances. I don't even want to eat at this point, and it feels like I'm starting to feel these symptoms worse and worse for eating even just one bite of chicken that has a slight dot of ketchup or something.

The lab hummed like a throat clearing. Emergency lights washed the benches in a dim green, and the smell of cold metal and coffee lingered over the glassware. Lina twenty-eight, tired from the week but electric tonight clicked the door shut behind her and lifted the roll-down blind. Rain rattled the windows. On the far bench, Tomas turned, the edge of his grin caught by the glow.

“You kept the key,” he said.

“You kept the playlist,” she answered, nodding at the small speaker buried between a stack of lab notebooks. A soft piano looped, warm and low.

They hadn’t seen each other in a year, not really. Conferences had turned into different cities, ambition into different time zones. But the alumni weekend had pulled them back to the same campus—and, somehow, to this room where they’d once argued over solvents and futures with equal heat.

Lina tugged off her coat and draped it over a stool. “One hour before security does rounds,” she said, glancing at the clock. “What do we do with it?”

Tomas lifted a beaker as if toasting her. “We stop pretending we don’t know how to measure what matters.”

She tried to hide a smile, failed, and walked the length of the bench, fingertips skimming labels she could still recite from memory. He watched her the way he used to watch data stabilize—careful, patient, a little amazed as it settled into clarity.

“Do you ever miss it?” he asked.

“The lab?” She shrugged. “Sometimes. The precision. The clean borders. Life outside doesn’t have many.”

He nodded. “Out there feels like guesswork.” His voice softened. “Us, too.”

The hood fan ticked. Somewhere, a drip from a drying rack counted seconds. Lina stopped at the gap in the bench where he stood and reached for his sleeve. It was damp from the rain. He didn’t move away.

“I thought about calling,” she said. “I didn’t know if I’d be a detour.”

He laughed under his breath. “You were the destination.”

The sentence landed between them like a light being switched on. She felt it in her stomach, warm and a little dizzying. Tomas set the beaker down and folded the distance. When he touched her face, it wasn’t a question so much as a confirmation of something both of them had already chosen.

The first kiss was quiet, steady as a baseline. The second was not. She felt the week drain out of her shoulders; he tasted like mint and rain. The green light made their skin look like a secret. She slid her hands under his jacket, and he drew her closer until the lab coats on the hooks swung and whispered. The piano on the speaker found a pulse; the night outside pressed its ear to the glass.

“Tell me we’re not inventing this,” he murmured against her temple.

“We’re replicating a result,” she said, and he laughed, and she loved that she could make him do that—still.

They broke apart just enough to look at each other, to take stock the way they would before a big run. His brow was softer than she remembered; her hair was a little shorter; both of them were none of the things they’d feared they’d become. Grown, yes. Hardened, not quite.

“Stay,” he said. It wasn’t a command. It was a line on a whiteboard she could erase or circle.

“For tonight,” she said. Then, after a breath, “And then…we’ll see.”

He nodded like a promise. The rain picked up, a hush turning into applause. Tomas reached past her to flick off the overhead strip. The room fell almost dark except for the emergency glow and the city smudge beyond the windows. The world narrowed to breath and heartbeat and the small geography of two people who remembered exactly where the other’s gravity lay.

They kissed again, slower, as if savoring a familiar experiment with a better protocol. Her hands found his shoulders; his found the small of her back. A rack of empty vials chimed as their hips nudged the bench. She laughed into his mouth; he caught it like something precious.

The rest of it belonged to the closed door and the rain: the way they moved by touch and instinct, how the music thinned and rose, how they learned again the map they’d drawn years ago. When the piano finally faded, the room held only their breathing and the soft clink of settling glass.

Later, the clock would surprise them. The rain would ease. They would step back into their coats, out into the corridor, and the future would be waiting like a long, unmarked page.

For now, the green light hummed, and they stood together in its quiet, two constants in a world of variables, holding on just long enough for the moment to stabilize before they left it to its own beautiful half-life.",1,1755138621.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

When you're doing work that doesn't align with who you are, your inner self starts protesting. It's like your spirit is constantly swimming upstream while your body goes through the motions.

I've been there. Dragging myself to a job that paid well but made me feel hollow inside. Checking all the boxes society told me to check, but feeling more drained every single day.

The crazy thing is, once I started pursuing something that actually excited me, my energy completely shifted. Suddenly I had stamina for things that mattered. I stopped needing three alarms to get out of bed.

1mpo7af,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodbuilding/comments/1mpo7af/lystran_cuisine/,Lystran cuisine,"*Set in a small fictional Southern Iberian nation called Lystra, after bolstered support for the anarchists and a partial Soviet invasion of Spain have defeated Franco, divided the peninsula, and sparked off a significantly warmer cold war.*

Lystra is known for its hearty seafood and meat dishes, and for novel combinations of local and international cuisines, as well as unique fusions of rustic and sophisticated ingredients and flavors.

Sweet radish, garlic, and lime (fresh, juiced, dried, candied) are the holy trinity of Lystran aromatics, though fresh and dried oranges, fresh and pickled onions, pine nuts, black pepper, cinnamon, marjoram, oregano, paprika, and saffron are all heavily used across the country.

Breakfast is usually a light affair of fresh or toasted bread, nuts, and fruit with goat or sheep's cheese and dried pork or beef often taken with milky coffee or tea.

Reflecting Lystra's agricultural legacy, the most important meal of the day is a communal midday lunch, often eaten outdoors, which might include a hearty roast or casserole as well as many shared side dishes. In the cities, lighter fare is more popular, including street food. British afternoon tea has become more popular with the upper set since independence, and wine is commonly consumed at lunchtime, especially the tart and bitter blue wine.

Although a simple vegetable soup with bread and tea, wine, or brandy is traditional for evening meal, gourmands have been excited by a wave of new dinner restaurant openings in the capital reflecting influences from around Iberia and the Continent and beyond, in part to serve the country's burgeoning immigrant and transitory population.

Internationally, in addition to seafood Lystra is strongly associated with lamb and goat meat, cheese, and milk, and the shepherd's crook is a treasured national symbol.

**Paizoso** \- a simple flatbread of wheat flour, milk, and honey, baked in traditional kazkor (crab) ovens

## Key Features Analysis

The best round tables of 2025 showcase a blend of innovative design, durable materials, and functional features.

**material Durability:** Round tables are constructed from a variety of materials, including solid wood, engineered wood, metal, glass, and composites. Solid wood tables, such as those made from oak or walnut, offer extraordinary durability and a classic aesthetic. Engineered wood tables, such as those with a laminate or veneer finish, provide a cost-effective alternative while maintaining a stylish appearance. Metal tables, often made from steel or aluminum, offer a modern and industrial look, while glass tables provide a sleek and minimalist design. The most durable options feature scratch-resistant and heat-resistant finishes, ensuring longevity and ease of maintenance.

The selection of material plays a pivotal role in the longevity and aesthetic appeal of the table,aligning with the intended application and surroundings.

**Extendable Design:** Many modern round tables feature an extendable design, allowing them to accommodate additional guests when needed. Extension mechanisms vary, including butterfly leaf extensions, drop-leaf extensions, and self-storing leaf extensions. Butterfly leaf extensions are hinged leaves that fold out from beneath the table's surface, while drop-leaf extensions are hinged leaves that fold down to reduce the table's size. Self-storing leaf extensions are separate leaves that can be stored within the table when not in use. The extendable design enhances the versatility of the round table, making it suitable for both intimate gatherings and larger events.

The ease of extending the table and the stability of the extended surface are crucial factors to consider when evaluating this feature.

**Base Stability and Design:** The base of a round table is critical for stability and aesthetic appeal. common base designs include pedestal bases, four-legged bases, and trestle bases.Pedestal bases, often made from metal or wood, provide a central support point, maximizing legroom and creating a clean and elegant look. Four-legged bases offer a customary and stable design, while trestle bases provide a rustic and industrial aesthetic. The base construction should be robust and well-balanced, ensuring that the table remains stable even when fully loaded.

The base should complement the overall design of the table and provide adequate support for the table top.**Surface Finish and Texture:** The surface finish of a round table affects its durability, appearance, and ease of maintenance. Finishes include lacquer, varnish, oil, and stain. Lacquer finishes provide a glossy and durable surface, while varnish finishes offer a more natural and matte look. Oil finishes penetrate the wood, enhancing its natural grain and providing a soft and warm feel. Stain finishes add color and depth to the wood, while protecting it from moisture and scratches. The texture of the table surface can range from smooth to textured, depending on the desired aesthetic and functionality.

The ideal surface finish offers a balance of durability, aesthetic appeal, and ease of cleaning.

Key features of the best round tables include:

* robust construction

## FAQs Section

Addressing common inquiries provides clarity and enhances consumer confidence in their purchasing decisions.

**What is the ideal size round table for my dining room?**

The ideal size depends on the size of your dining room and the number of people you typically accommodate. A 48-inch round table comfortably seats four people, while a 60-inch round table can seat six. For larger gatherings, consider an extendable round table or a larger diameter table, ensuring there is ample space for diners and comfortable movement around the table. Consider leaving at least 36 inches between the table and any walls or other furniture to allow for easy passage.

The ideal size directly correlates with the intended occupancy and spatial dimensions of the room.**How do I care for a round table made of solid wood?**

Solid wood round tables require regular cleaning and maintenance to preserve their beauty and longevity. Dust the table regularly with a soft cloth and avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. Protect the surface from heat and moisture by using coasters and placemats. Apply a wood polish or conditioner periodically to nourish the wood and prevent it from drying out or cracking. Address spills instantly to prevent staining or water damage.

Routine maintenance is essential to uphold the aesthetic integrity and structural soundness of solid wood round tables.

**Are glass round tables safe for families with young children?**

Glass round tables can be safe for families with young children if they are made with tempered glass and have rounded edges. tempered glass is much stronger than regular glass and is less likely to shatter. Rounded edges prevent sharp corners,reducing the risk of injury. Consider adding a table protector or tablecloth for extra safety and to minimize the risk of scratches or fingerprints.

Preemptive measures and material consideration ensure glass round tables are functionally safe in family environments.

1mpo6eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1mpo6eu/needing_honest_feedback_for_an_honest_self_memoir/,Needing Honest feedback for an honest self memoir about the struggles of being a woman and the things I've dealt with.,"This is a pretty raw idea. I make a chapter for every terrible thing that has happened regarding men throughout my life. It's all true. If ever published would be under a psuedonym. I dont have REAL writing experience but my entire life have been a ""writer"" per se. I'd just LOVE to get some real feedback from unobligated third parties on my first chapter so I can decide if this is something I'd really love to pursue. Here it is in all it's glory!

I will start off with a trigger warning. It is uncomfortable and real. There are very detailed ""assault"" scenes.

  
Preface



When the world is quiet, and everyone sleeps, I lie awake. I lie awake and i think. I think about everything that's led up to today. I think about the small things and the big things. I think about people. I think about men. I have been questioned before the who's, what's, where's and why's. The biggest ones are the why's. ""why are you afraid?"" Why did you let that happen?"" ""why didn't you say anything?"" ""why did you like it?"" Why. Didn't. You. Say. No? That's the biggest one isn't it? Why didn't I say no? I haven't been able to answer those questions my whole life. I don't know why these things happened to me. I don't know why these things happen to anyone. If you're squeamish, don't look away. This isn't a fairytale. This is not going to be comfortable or cozy. It isn't going to make you feel good. It's not supposed to. What you're going to read about, is the harsh, raw realism of what women and men everywhere are going through right now. This has happened to someone you know. This has probably happened to your mother, or sister. Your daughter or your friend. Maybe people will finally stop questioning women. We don't need to be bombarded. We don't have all the answers. I promise you this. Hopefully, these true stories will help you understand a little better. Maybe they will help me understand a little better. All our lives we're made to feel like it was all our faults. Like it was something we did. The way we dressed or spoke. The fact that we didn't say no. The fact we smiled or laughed at a joke or situation where we should've been scared because our anxiety made us giggle. If these words can help heal even just one hurting soul, I've done my job. This story will not have a happy ending though. Because my story is not over, and i fear there's more in store for me. But we will see, won't we?





Chapter 1

Age 7 - ""Uncle Tee""



""Mom I don't want to wear a skirt!"" I was always a tomboy. I loved my jeans and t-shirts. My mom was old school. She still believed girls should be in skirts and dresses with their hair done up nice in pretty bows. I tried wearing black eyeliner and dying my hair orange for my third grade picture day. ""Rebecca, please just dress nice. Your grandparents aren't going to want to see you show up in your ripped jeans and stained shirts."" She was laying out my nicest, newest clothes on the bed for me. A jean and plaid miniskirt that looked much too short for a 7 year old was on top of the pile. She wanted me to wear it there. It was part of the clothes she had picked out for me when we had gone back to school shopping just a few months before. It was a weekend and my parents must've needed a break. I couldn't remember the last time I had stayed overnight at my grandparents house, if ever. They lived in the next city over in a modestly sized house. My uncle, Uncle Tee, short for Trevor, lived in their basement. I liked visiting them well enough when the whole family would go over for lunch on Sundays, but I still couldn't imagine actually sleeping there. It all seemed so foreign to me and had my stomach in knots and butterflies. ""Mom I don't feel good. I don't want to go."" I grabbed at my stomach. “Becky,’ she came closer to me and rubbed my shoulder. It felt nice, but I could feel the harshness radiating off her body. Now it felt a little too firm. “Please.” I could hear the irritation in her voice. Those two words were enough to “cure” my tummy ache. “Okay mom, Sorry.” I looked down at my empty barbie suitcase and the pile of clothes laying next to it. “Thank you.” She half smiled but it was gone before she turned around. She disappeared down the stairs to the living room and i heard her muttering to my dad, annoyance bubbling up, just out of earshot. I sighed and put the clothes into the pink plastic roll away suitcase. I felt like I needed a new one but my parents were, well, lets just call it frugal. “Becky!” She called up the stairs. I hated the way she said my nickname, Becky. It always felt like I was frustrating her. I’d rather she just called me Rebecca. Why would she name me that if she didn’t even use it? “Let’s get this show on the road!” My dad seemed happy that I was leaving. My dad was easy to read. He was happy that I was going to see his parents. He likely just hoped they would appreciate the time with their grandchild. He wasn’t malicious and had no real deep meanings or hidden intentions. With my dad, you always knew what you were getting. I loved that about him. I guess my first encounter with a man, my dad, wasn’t a bad one. So at least there's that. 



I climbed a little reluctantly into the back of our puke green minivan and buckled my seatbelt. Both my parents came along for the ride. My dad to see his parents, and my mom to save face. She didn’t like my grandparents, or anyone for that matter. She believed everyone was out to get her. She didn’t believe there were good people in the world. I guess that’s where I get it from. I watched the houses fly past the window and pretended there was a horse running next to the van. I always did that. I pretended he was jumping over fences and racing to keep up with us. He always did and it made me smile. God I was so innocent, So ignorant to the world and how my whole life was about to change. We made a stop or two, I don’t remember the drive much. Just this sick deep impending dread that kept my stomach feeling like i was on a rollercoaster, and i still wondered if I'd throw up and get to go home early. My little horse slowed beside us and i recognized the street. We were here already. The drive usually felt longer but I guess time flies when you’re having a panic attack. My mom slid the side door open and i climbed out and on to the driveway. It was a warm night but I still felt the goosebumps prickle up on my legs. I wish I had been old enough to notice the signs. I wish my parents had protected me, but I can’t blame them. They had no idea what kind of horror house they were sending my into. My dad pressed the button for the doorbell. Did it always sound like a funeral march? My grandma opened the door with a big smile. “Hey! You’re here! Come in, come in!” She hugged my dad first, then me and my mom. My grandpa appeared at the end of the hallway standing in the doorway of the kitchen. “how was the drive?’ He asked us that every time even though the answer was always the same. “same as always pa” My dad answered. He threw an arm around my dads shoulders and led him into the kitchen. “Pa we’re not staying, we’re just dropping off Becky.” Why did they seem so eager to leave me here? Why didn’t they care that I was walking so slowly, or fidgeting with my skirt? It was too short. “You can stay for some food?” My grandpa posed it as a question but we all knew he meant you have no choice. He wasn’t malicious either. He just wanted to spend time with his family. I wondered if it was lonely with just the two of them. Oh right. Uncle Tee. 



After my parents had eaten something, we all walked to the door to say our goodbyes. I didn’t say anything but was pleading with my eyes. ‘Dad, don’t let her do this. Don’t let mom leave me here. Can’t you see she doesn’t care? Can’t you see somethings wrong?’ I was screaming on the inside. On the outside i smiled and hugged my mom and dad. I grabbed my moms forearm in one last ditch effort to make her see how sweaty my hands were. I was wishing she’d stop and question me, feel my forehead for a slight fever. Something. She jerked her arm away and waved as she walked out. My grandma shut the door. The silence rung in my ears as my grandparents stood, looking at me awkwardly. None of us knowing what to do next. “you want to watch some tv?” My grandpa asked. I nodded and followed him to the living room. It was a house for old people. There were little glass figurines everywhere and the couches had plastic coverings. There was no fun for a kid here so why was I here? I sat there in silence with my grandpa for what felt like an eternity watching tv. I think we watched a soccer game because for some reason he thought I’d be interested in it. I wasn’t. I sat so still and rigid that my bones started to hurt. As i looked up at the clock, time seemed to have slowed to a crawl. Had it really only been 45 minutes? It felt like hours. I yawned and looked up again. Finally it was dark outside and I knew soon I’d go to bed and then it would be the next morning and I’d get to leave. My grandpa noticed me yawning and asked, “do you want to go downstairs and see what uncle Tee is doing? He has a few games and toys down there he might let you play with.” I perked up at the thought of getting to do anything other than sit here and watch more soccer so I said probably a bit too eagerly “Yes please!”



 My grandpa led the way down a big slippery staircase. The basement was just a concrete floor. It was under the house and very cold. I remember scolding my mom in my head ‘see why would you make me wear a skirt? Now I’m cold. I told you so.’ I wrapped my arms around myself and shivered. This felt weird. It felt like a dungeon. It was too dark. “Tee! Becky’s here and I think I’m boring her.” He choked out a laugh. I hope I didn’t offend him. “Do you have any video games or maybe you can let her play with some of the model cars?” My Uncle Tee turned his head to the left a little, but didn’t look all the way back, as if he was bored himself. “Sure! send her in here.” He motioned for me to come in with his arm. I walked into the big dark room and across the cold cement floor. I looked back but my grandpa had already started back up the stairs. My Uncle Tee was an older man. Probably in his late 30’s at this point. He had lived at home his whole life. He was short and had a big beer belly. He was balding. I didn’t understand at the time but now I know why he could never find a girlfriend and had to live in his parents basement. The couch he was on faced the Tv which was against the grey brick wall. His back was to me and I noticed he didn’t turn once to look at me. I didn’t feel the same warmth with my arrival as I did with my grandparents. Did he not want me here? Did he not care? Why did I want his approval? This was my first experience with a mans “power move” He didn’t want me to feel welcomed. He didn’t care that I was nervous. He might’ve even liked it that I felt like that. I stopped behind the couch and waited. I’m not sure what I was waiting for. I guess I was hoping the lump in my throat would go away so I could say hello. He finally turned to look at me. “Hey Becky!” He greeted my happily. It felt strange. It felt forced like an act. He was almost too happy to see me. Why did his eyes light up like that when he saw me? “I heard my dad was boring you! Come here! sit, sit.” He patted the seat on the couch next to him. I walked around the arm of the couch and hovered for a second so he could move his hand off the seat he was rubbing. He noticed I was waiting and the corner of his mouth turned up in a stomach churning smile. He chuckled. He had tiny moustache hairs on his upper lip. It reminded me of an adolescent boy who was declaring he could grow a beard as the first whisker sprouted off his chin.



I’m not sure if it was him or the basement but it smelled like stale beer and my stomach flipped. “You want to watch a movie?” He asked me lazily. “sure.” I answered, trying to sound calm though i know i didn’t. This seemed like it could be better than soccer at least. Maybe I’d fall asleep and wake up to my dad carrying me out to the van. He walked over to the tall bookcase beside the TV. The top few shelves had hand made model cars lining them wall to wall. Every shelf from there down had movie and video game cases. “I have some kids movies here. I like most of them. What do you feel like watching?” He was scanning the shelves with his finger, his eyes squinted as if deep in thought. “I don’t know what do you have?” I shrugged my shoulders. How was I supposed to know what was over there. He laughed and pointed at the shelves. “Do you see how much is here? Why don’t you come take a look?” He gestured with a wave of his hand and a tilt of his head. I got up and shuffled over. I felt a bit more comfortable now. I stood in front of the bookcase. I couldn’t see up past the fifth shelf and there had to have been at least three more shelves of movies above me. I could feel his breath on the top of my head making my baby hairs blow around. The stale beer smell was definitely him. I knew that smell all too well coming off my mom. He had been drinking not long before I had come downstairs. I looked over at the coffee table and saw two beer cans on top of it and three more stashed on the shelf underneath it. I felt my throat close up. My experience with drunk people came from watching my mom every night. It was never a happy sight and usually ended up with me crying under the covers with my ears plugged until I fell asleep. My heart started pounding and I felt like I was going to throw up. I pointed to the first kids movie i saw and hurried back over to sit on the couch. I sat on the far right as close to the arm as I could. I was giving him plenty of room to stay far away from me. I planted both feet on the floor and sat rigid again. My body was in fight or flight but it knew flight was my best option for survival. I wanted nothing more than to run up the big slippery wood stairs and out the front door. Instead, I sat, and I waited. I knew something bad was coming. I could feel it in the air, smell it on his breath. It was hanging in the air like a storm.



 He had pushed the DVD tray closed and sat back down. Why was he sitting so close to me? Had I not left plenty of room on the other side of the couch? His knee fell and it touched mine as he stretched his arms out across the back of the couch. We sat like that in silence for what felt like forever. He cracked a couple jokes and I smiled and pretended to laugh when all I wanted to do was scream for help. Why didn’t I get up and leave? It was like I had been paralyzed. Frozen right there, doomed to be a statue on that couch for eternity. Finally, Uncle Tee sat up. “I’m getting a drink, do you want anything?” My eyes met his and I shook my head. He smiled his crooked smile and I finally loosened my legs when he announced he was leaving. I had let my guard down for only a second and relaxed so that my knees had fallen apart. He must’ve forgotten he had the TV remote on his lap because it clattered to the floor when he stood up and the batteries fell out of the back. “aw damn” He went down on all fours like a dog to pick up the remote and turned his head toward the couch. Was I imagining it? Was he staring directly up my skirt? What underpants did I have on that day? Did they cover enough? I was frozen. He stared at me. At “it”. I didn’t know what was happening. It felt like there was a fog over my eyes. A haze had fallen on my life at that very moment. “Well isn’t that something!” He declared loudly, still staring at my privates. He braced himself on the table and my thigh and got up onto his knees. His hand slid up my skirt and I knew it felt wrong. Why didn’t I scream? Why didn’t i slap him? I squeezed my eyes shut as tightly as I could and imagined I was dreaming. I was floating through the haze and fog. His fingertips felt like electric shocks up my thigh and across my underpants. No, I wasn’t there. I was in the clouds. This wasn’t happening. It was all a bad dream. His hot breath was against my neck and he was forcing my underpants to the side. I am a balloon floating through the sky on a foggy day. I don’t feel anything. I am numb. There are no rough fingers ripping through my private parts, stealing the thing that’s most precious to a little girl. There is no sharp pain. I don’t hear his breath catching in his throat. I am a million miles away. Floating. 



I don’t remember what happened next. I don’t remember how I got there but I was in bed. I was in the little cot my grandparents had setup on the floor beside their bed. I was awake and I was crying. “hey! what’s the matter?” My grandma exclaimed when she heard me loudly sobbing. “I, I - I don’t f-f-feel, good.” I managed to get out between stuttered gasps for air. “I w-w-want to g-g-o home!” I breathed out loudly. My grandma must have realized I wasn’t kidding around and jumped out of bed. She ran out to the hallway and into kitchen to where the phone hung on the wall. I heard her hushed voice muttering lowly, probably trying not to wake my grandpa. “Okay, see you soon, bye.” I heard her robe brushing the floor through the hall back into the bedroom. She stood in the doorway and told me to get up and pack up my things. My parents would be there in 30 minutes. 



I never told my parents what happened that night. I never told anyone what happened that night. I’m not sure why. Maybe I thought no one would believe me. Maybe I knew it wouldn’t matter. I didn’t want to get anyone in trouble. The whole family loved Uncle Tee. I loved Uncle Tee. To this day I can barely look him in the eyes when I see him. But deep down, he knows. I know. and it’ll be our secret.

Had joint pain and stomach issues since I was 10. Over the years developed multiple food intolerances (now can’t eat wheat, dairy, corn, tomatoes, coffee, chocolate, soy, peanuts). Multiple doctors, normal tests except gastritis. SIBO breath test negative but have all symptoms. Antibiotics once made me feel great temporarily. Now dealing with reflux, bloating, rashes, fatigue, nutrient deficiencies, and joint pain. Insurance won’t cover rifaximin. Looking for others who’ve been through this or found solutions.


When I was around 10, I had really bad joint pain (to the point where I could barely walk) and bad stomach problems. My mom took me to a chiropractor who did that weird muscle test where you hold bottles in one hand (with wheat, corn, etc.) and they push down on your arm. If they can push it down, you “react” to that food. After that, I stopped eating wheat and dairy, and my problems went away.

That worked for a while, but as I got older more foods started to bother me again. At 16, a new doctor ran stool tests, parasite checks, autoimmune panels, and thyroid tests — all normal. She gave me antibiotics and for a short time I felt amazing (clear skin, no stomach pain), but at the end of taking them I started getting rashes.

Now I can’t eat wheat, dairy, corn, tomatoes, coffee, chocolate, soy, peanuts, or anything derived from those without feeling awful.
Recently, I went to a GI doctor who did a colonoscopy and endoscopy, and the only finding was gastritis. SIBO breath test was negative (even though I have all the symptoms). She wants to try rifaximin, but my insurance rejected it and it’s $2000 out of pocket.

My current symptoms:

Acid reflux & heartburn
Gas, bloating, burping
Food intolerances/sensitivities
Stomach pain, cramping, nausea
Diarrhea & constipation
Itchy rashes & acne
Fatigue
Slight weight gain
Joint pain
Headaches
Nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin D, B12, magnesium, etc.)


I feel like I’m slowly losing the ability to eat almost anything without a reaction, and no one can tell me why. I'm starting to get desperate, and pretty much only eat chicken, rice, and potatoes at this point. And they have to be completely plain or it bothers my gastritis or one of my food intolerances. I don't even want to eat at this point, and it feels like I'm starting to feel these symptoms worse and worse for eating even just one bite of chicken that has a slight dot of ketchup or something. 

Has anyone else gone through something like this? Did you find a cause or treatment that actually helped?
