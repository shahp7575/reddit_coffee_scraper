My ""stats"" are 5'10"" and 165lbs. I'm a highly motivated person, constantly striving for improvement and challenging my own beliefs. I've built a life I'm pretty proud of atm, I work as a chemical operator which I can see myself doing till I retire. When I'm not at work, I go for runs, hit the gym regularly, and playing with my pit/lab mix named Strider (yes, as in LOTR).

I'm a bit of a nerd, so fantasy is a huge thing for me—from Lord of the Rings movies to the annual Harry Potter marathon around the holidays. I visit the local renaissance fair (we should dress up!)so it would be cool if we could bond over that! I also love to travel, read history books, and try new restaurant/coffee shops, hanging with friends, and music festivals.

What I'm Looking For

I’m a big hopeless romantic so take that for what it’s worth! I think fundamentally, even if we don't share the exact same hobbies, having the same goals and a similar future outlook is most important. I'm looking for a partner to share in the small, intimate moments that make a relationship special:

\- Weekend cuddles and lazy mornings

\- Evening coffee shop reading dates

\- Random road trips and hitting the gym together

\- Holding hands at the farmer’s market or snuggling in a hammock (I’m super affectionate in private and in public).

I'm an inquisitive person, so I tend to ask a lot of questions. I don't mind calling whenever you're comfortable because conversations typically flow better that way for me.

I’m open to long-distance relationships (in the US only), but my ultimate goal is for us to eventually move in together, relocation to me is ideal.

If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you! I'll probably only respond if your open to sharing a pic within the first message or two so we can see if the attraction is mutual, i do have preferences for partners who have are slim/thin or lean towards the athletic/fit side and ideally over 25 but not a deal breaker.

I’m looking for some advice on whether my De’Longhi Dinamica pump might be on its way out, or if this still sounds like an air-block or something else.

Over the last few days I’ve been dealing with recurring air blocks. I have been able clear them by running hot water, but the issue keeps coming back. Now the water pump has started making a noticeably louder noise than before.

I tried to resolve by descaling several times : 
•	Flow through the coffee spout was very slow and pump sound is loud 
•	Hot water spout sputters like there’s air in the system

Water tank valve checked and fine, there is no water leaking inside the unit.

Has anyone seen similar symptoms on a Dinamica? •	Are there clear signs the pump itself is failing? •	Anything else I should check before considering a pump replacement?

I tend to pre - buy somewhat, impulse buys and occasional stocking up on stuff I like 

 so I need to freeze to “keep” longer. Of course I squeeze the air out. 

A roaster I know & respect mentioned that their advice is to always rest fully before freezing to store.

Do you agree.

It’s pretty hard to get the resting period right, if freezing “arrests” the coffee so that any further resting post-removal from the freezer isn’t advantageous.

So my takeaway is that once frozen resting is kinda set & the beans won’t “improve” further after thawing.

I wonder if this has been tested.

1qbprq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/1qbprq1/my_omad_story_30th_day_today_experience/,"My OMAD STORY, 30TH Day today (Experience)","Hi,

I am shivanshu from india, 21, 5""11 and 83kg before OMAD, I started my OMAD 30days back, it was comfortable time in my life inwas eating whatever I wanted to usually cold coffee with some snacks twice or thrice a day, for last 6 months I am constantly monitering my weight and it never came less than 80kg, but as the winter season arrived my weight peaked at 83.

On day zero of OMAD I saw myself in the mirror and noticed a very unusual thing which made my self image more worse, I have been watching looksmaxing content for a very long time and jaw line is generally considered very important, in the mirror I saw that from my ear to neck it's a approximate 90° angle, my jaw and neck is mostly same or merged due to face bloating and excessive body fat, at the age of 21 I was looking way older and unhealthy, belly fat has always been my partner, I have a visible belly fat which is also ugly but it hides in the clothes and not visible then, also my chest has fat, looks like I have grown boobs, not a very masculine body or healthy which girls might want to see. Embarrassing 

At that time I got a OMED video on my yt feed which claims many benefits like autophagy, long life span, mental clarity/focus, fat loss.

I thought to try it for a few days, Even if it doesn't work, what could be more worse?

And the journey begins 

Day 1-------------)
Morning, I ate nothing just water and black coffe 3 times a day.

Morning weight was 83.5kg didn't measure in the night cause I know what weight change would happen in one day alone

My family is vegetarian so we don't eat meat, only dairy and eggs were my main meal

My family has a mobile phone shop, peak business hours 6pm to 9.30pm

So I left my shop at 9pm to prepare my meal which takes more half or an hour. So I usually ate my meal around at 10pm

Why I don't eat before 6pm?

Cause I have a problem sleeping without food, I need food in my stomach to be able to sleep peacefully 

I could have tried to eat early but if my sleep is bad then stress come along and munching

I don't wanted it, so I made a simple rule just eat once.

What i usually eat

8eggs

Paneer

Curd

Soya chunks

Chickpeas 

Lentils 

Milk

Mix vegetable cooked

Dark chocolate 

Pumpkin seeds

Mustard oil or ghee

Mushroom 

Amla

Ofcourse I can't eat all at once so I make multiple combinations

Like 40gm soya chunks, 500gm curd, 100gm paneer, bowl of mix vegitable, nuts and seeds sometimes milk

Quantity may vary, but I usually achieve 100 to 120gm protein as per chatgpt, and also micr nutrients, maybe omega3 is my deficiency or potassium 

But everything else is okay.

When I measure my weight on day 2 (morning)

It was 81kg

I was shocked how much excessive water weight my body holds all day along.

It didn't take much time to reach me back to 80kg, less than a week.

I follow OMED for a month, these are the benifits I experienced 

Mental clarity 

Reduced sexual urges

Reduced acne

Face bloating 

Reduced belly fat

More time for other work

Better immunity 

More confidence 

Less stress and anxiety.


Now my weight is 75.5kg I feel lite and happy

OMAD Totally worth it

But I also feel better that I actually took a step fulfilled it and achieved really good results.

My face bloating is reduced however my belly fat is something I need to work much longer.

Today is the 30th day of this omad challenge, it's 6pm in india right now.

Also 

I had a trophy or a gift for myself, an added rule.

In a period of a week and 10 days (eg- day 7,10,14,20,21,28,30) I toss a coin

If the chosen side comes I get to drink my cold coffee 

I won like three times in this month also today so I had a cold coffee in the morning.

It's been an exciting journey begin with the objective of loosing weight but turned into a life lesson an achievement which I will never forget.

I think the OMAD will be continued from Tommorow onwards

During this OMAD I didn't do any exercise just my studies and my shop and my first/last meal of the day.

What do you think of my story, please let know.

1qbpr84,https://www.reddit.com/r/propfirm/comments/1qbpr84/your_brain_is_legacy_software_trying_to_run_a/,"Your brain is legacy software trying to run a high-frequency market and the ""survival"" code is exactly what’s blowing your accounts","I spent years sitting in front of six monitors, white-knuckling my mouse and screaming at myself to ""just be disciplined."" I’d have my best day ever on a Monday, feel like a god, and then systematically dismantle my entire account by Thursday afternoon. I felt like a failure until I stopped listening to ""mindset gurus"" and started looking at the data coming out of institutional desks like Jane Street.

The truth is, elite firms don’t hire zen monks; they hire people who understand that **human neurology is fundamentally misaligned with modern financial markets**. You aren't ""weak."" You are just a mammal trying to survive in an environment that specifically punishes every instinct that kept your ancestors alive.

Here is the raw data on why your biology is a financial liability:

• **The ""Survival"" Glitch (Prospect Theory):** Your brain is running an outdated operating system. Kahneman proved that the pain of a loss is **twice as powerful** as the joy of a gain. This triggers the **Disposition Effect**: you are biologically mandated to sell your winners too early to stop the anxiety, while holding your losers too long to avoid the ""death"" of a realized loss.

• **The Decision Battery (Ego Depletion):** You make about **35,000 decisions a day**. Every candle you watch and every ""maybe"" trade you pass on drains your ""discipline battery."" Neurocognitive research shows that your accuracy and alertness drop off a cliff after just **20 to 30 minutes** of intense vigilance. By the afternoon, your analytical brain (**System 2**) is offline, and your impulsive gut (**System 1**) is driving the car.

• **The Reference Dependence Trap:** Your brain doesn't see your account balance as a number; it sees it as a ""starting point"". When you drop $500, you aren't trading for profit anymore; you are trading to ""get back to even"" to stop the chemical signals of failure. This is the biological root of **revenge trading**.

• **The Quantitative Cost of Emotion:** Data proves that a spike in your heart rate in response to P&L fluctuations **causally reduces your earnings**. If your heart is racing, you are literally losing money in real-time because your prefrontal cortex has been hijacked.

**The Institutional Solution: ""Rational Friction""**

The pros don't rely on ""willpower"" they assume the human operator *will* malfunction. They implement **""Kill Switches""** and pre-trade controls that are non-negotiable. They know that the only way to survive is to insert **""rational friction""** between an emotional impulse and market execution.

I realized I couldn't manually calculate my ""High-Water Mark"" or monitor my own **Ego Depletion** while the market was moving. My survival wiring was too busy trying to keep me from feeling the pain of a red day.

**I built a Notion-based risk terminal called TradeApollo to act as my ""Robot Boss.""** It functions as a mandatory external executive function. It tracks my real-time equity drawdown not just balance and acts as a logic gate. If I hit my daily loss limit, it doesn't ""ask"" me to stop; it forces a hard breach protocol that ends the session. It stops me from fighting my biology and forces me to follow the math.

# Part One: The Fight

Marcus slammed his laptop shut. ""I'm not doing this again, Sarah.""

""You never listen!"" Sarah's voice cracked. She was sitting at their kitchen table, her laptop open to another rejected job application. ""You just sit there and tell me I'm being dramatic—""

""I didn't say that—""

""You said I was 'overthinking' the temperature thing at the office. You said I should just 'wear layers.' Do you know how that sounds? Like it's my job to adapt to a space that wasn't built for me?""

Marcus exhaled through his nose. ""The office is 70 degrees, Sarah. That's normal. That's standard.""

""For YOU."" Sarah stood up, her chair scraping. ""It's standard for you. I'm cold every single day. My hands go numb. I can't type properly. And when I ask if we can turn it up two degrees—TWO—I'm told I'm being difficult.""

""You're making this a bigger deal than it is.""

""Because you don't feel it!"" Sarah's hands were shaking—from anger or cold, Marcus couldn't tell. ""You don't feel any of it. The office is the right temperature. The desks are the right height. The chairs fit. The tools fit your hands. The world fits YOU, Marcus. So when I say it doesn't fit me, you think I'm complaining about nothing.""

Marcus stood up too. ""I work just as hard as you, Sarah. I don't get 'special treatment.' Nobody's catering to me.""

""That's the point!"" Sarah's voice was raw now. ""You don't need special treatment. The world already fits. You just don't see it because you've never had to.""

They stood there, breathing hard, the space between them electric and unbridgeable.

""I'm going for a walk,"" Marcus said.

""Of course you are.""

He grabbed his jacket and left.



# Part Two: The Morning After

Marcus woke up with a pounding headache. The bedroom felt wrong—smaller, somehow. He sat up, and his knees hit something. The footboard. It was closer than it should be.

He rubbed his eyes. His alarm clock sat on the nightstand, but the nightstand was... lower. He had to reach down to turn it off.

But the alarm was coming from his phone. He grabbed it.

It felt... tiny. He looked at it. Same case. Same phone. But it looked like a child's toy in his hand.

He tried to swipe to turn off the alarm. His thumb covered half the screen. He tried to tap the ""stop"" button. His thumb hit three things at once. The alarm kept blaring.

He tried again, using the tip of his thumb, moving carefully. Finally got it.

He tried to type his passcode. His fingers felt like sausages on the tiny keys. He mistyped. Tried again. Mistyped.

*Fuck.*

On the third try, he got it. He looked at the phone. How had he used this yesterday?

He tried to put it in his pocket. It slipped right through a hole in the lining he didn't know was there and ended up somewhere near his knee, unreachable.

He fished it out and tried the other pocket. It fell out when he stood up.

""Sarah?"" he called, his voice sounding too loud.

No answer.

He stood up. His feet hit the floor, but the ceiling felt closer. He looked up. It was the same ceiling. Same light fixture. But it felt like it was pressing down.



# Part Three: The Bathroom

Marcus walked to the bathroom. The door was the same height, but as he stepped through, his shoulder brushed the frame. He'd never done that before.

The bathroom mirror showed his face—but only from the nose up. The rest was cut off. He bent his knees slightly, and there he was. Full face.

*What the hell?*

He straightened. The top of his head disappeared from view.

He turned to the sink. It was... lower. Definitely lower. He bent forward to wash his face, and his back immediately protested. He was hunched like a question mark.

He looked at the faucet. The handles were small. Delicate. He twisted the cold tap, and it turned too easily, water spraying.

""Marcus?"" Sarah's voice, from the kitchen.

He dried his hands on a towel that felt oddly small and walked out.



# Part Four: The Kitchen

Sarah was standing at the counter, making coffee. She looked comfortable, moving with easy, fluid motions. The counter hit her at the perfect height—just below her elbows.

Marcus walked up beside her. The counter hit him mid-thigh.

He stared.

""What's wrong?"" Sarah asked, glancing at him.

""The counter. It's...""

She looked at it. ""It's what?""

""It's too low.""

Sarah frowned. ""It's the same counter, Marcus.""

He bent down—way down—to reach the coffee pot. His spine curved. He felt the strain in his lower back immediately.

""This doesn't feel right,"" he muttered.

""You're just tired."" Sarah handed him a mug. It was small. Comically small. Like a child's tea set.

He took it. His fingers wrapped all the way around, touching his palm. He looked at Sarah. She held an identical mug. In her hands, it looked normal.

The coffee was hot. The mug was so small it heated his entire palm immediately. It burned. He set it down.

""Too hot?""

""The mug's too small. I can't hold it without burning myself.""

Sarah looked at him strangely. ""It's a normal mug, Marcus.""

He tried to pick it up by the handle. The handle was tiny—two fingers barely fit through. He lifted it awkwardly, his pinky sticking out.

He took a sip. The coffee was too hot, and the mug was too small to give any distance from the heat. He burned his lip.

""Shit.""

""You okay?""

He nodded, frustrated. He was sweating already. The kitchen felt warm. Stuffy.

""I'm going to get ready for work,"" he said.



# Part Five: The Phone

Marcus tried to check his messages while eating breakfast. He pulled out the tiny phone.

The screen was maybe 4.5 inches. He tried to read an email. The text was minuscule. He pinched to zoom. His fingers were too big. He zoomed in too far, then back out too far.

He tried to type a response. The keyboard was laughably small. Each key was maybe a quarter-inch wide. His thumbs hit three keys at once every time.

*thid id ridocyloys*

He deleted it. Tried again, using just the tip of his thumb, typing one letter at a time.

*This is ridiculous*

It took him 45 seconds to type two words.

He tried to hold the phone with one hand and type with the other. It slipped. He caught it before it hit the floor.

*Women's phones are too big. They don't fit in our pockets, we can't use them one-handed, they're not designed for our smaller hands.*

Sarah had said that. He'd said, ""Just get a smaller phone.""

*They don't make them smaller anymore. The 'standard' size keeps getting bigger.*

He'd said she was exaggerating.

Now he held a phone that was too small to type on, too small to read, too small to hold securely, and he wanted to throw it across the room.



# Part Six: The Car

Marcus walked to the parking lot, his back already aching. He unlocked the car—their shared sedan—and opened the driver's side door.

The seat was too close to the wheel. He reached down to adjust it. The lever was small, delicate. He yanked it back, and the seat slid—but only a few inches. He tried again. It wouldn't go any further.

He sat down, his knees bent at an awkward angle. The steering wheel was close to his chest. He felt cramped.

He reached for the seatbelt. It cut across his neck. He adjusted it, pulling it down, but it kept sliding back up.

Sarah got in the passenger seat. Her seatbelt sat perfectly across her chest and shoulder.

*Your seatbelt doesn't fit right because you're too tall. Just pull it down.*

That's what he'd said when Sarah complained that her seatbelt cut across her neck because she was shorter.

*I do pull it down. It slides back up.*

He'd said she wasn't adjusting it properly.

Now the seatbelt dug into his throat. He pulled it away from his skin. It snapped back.

He started the car. He glanced at the center console. The cup holders were too small for his travel mug. It wobbled precariously.

The storage compartment in the door was shallow—maybe five inches deep. He tried to put his sunglasses in. They didn't fit. The arms stuck out.

Sarah's small purse sat perfectly in her door compartment.

*Why don't cars have bigger door pockets? I need somewhere to put my purse.*

That's what Sarah had said.

*Why don't you just get a smaller purse?*

He'd actually said that.

Now his sunglasses sat on the dashboard, sliding around every time he turned, and he had nowhere to put them.

As he drove, the seatbelt kept cutting into his neck. He pulled it away. It snapped back. Every. Single. Time.



# Part Seven: The Office

The office building felt oppressive. Marcus walked through the lobby. The doorways felt narrow. He turned sideways slightly to walk through the break room door.

He made it to his desk and sat down. His knees hit the underside with a sharp crack.

""Shit,"" he hissed.

He scooted back. His feet couldn't reach the footrest. He put them flat on the ground, which meant his knees were higher than his hips. His pelvis tilted back. His spine curved.

He tried to reach the keyboard. His shoulders hunched forward.

He looked like a comma.

He tried to work. His mouse was tiny. He had to grip it with just his fingertips, his hand hovering in a claw shape. Within ten minutes, his wrist ached.

The office was warm. Too warm. He was sweating through his shirt.

By 10 a.m., Marcus's back was in spasms. He stood up—his chair creaking—and tried to stretch.

His manager, Linda, walked over. ""Marcus? You look uncomfortable.""

""The desk is too low. And it's hot in here.""

Linda tilted her head. ""It's standard height. And it's 76 degrees. Same as always.""

""That's too warm.""

""For you, maybe."" She looked at him with patient concern. ""You're sweating. You seem... agitated. Are you feeling alright?""

""I'm just uncomfortable.""

""You're flushed. Your face is red. You keep shifting around."" Linda's voice was gentle, clinical. ""Is this... are you having an erection right now?""

Marcus froze. ""What?""

""It's okay,"" Linda said quickly. ""Men get like this when your testosterone spikes. It's not your fault. You get all worked up, and then you start perceiving the environment as threatening. It's a hormonal thing. Very common.""

""I'm not—I don't have—"" He could feel his face getting hotter. ""I'm just hot and my back hurts!""

""See, you're getting very defensive. Very territorial. That's exactly what I'm talking about."" She made a note on her tablet. ""The aggression, the raised voice. These are classic signs of a testosterone surge. Why don't you take a break? Go splash some water on your face. Come back when you're feeling more... stable.""

*You're probably just on your period. You're being emotional.*

He'd said that to Sarah. Once. Years ago. She'd gone pale and walked away.

He'd thought she was overreacting.

Now he stood there, humiliated, being told his legitimate discomfort was just hormones making him irrational.

""I'm fine,"" he said quietly.

""Of course you are."" Linda smiled. ""But maybe just take five anyway. For everyone's comfort.""



# Part Eight: The Bathroom

Marcus walked to the bathroom, his face burning with shame.

Inside, the urinals were low. He had to bend his knees to avoid splashing. He felt ridiculous.

He went to the sink. It was shallow. He turned on the water, and it immediately splashed onto his pants.

""Damn it.""

He looked up at the mirror. It showed his chest. That was it.

He bent his knees. There was his face—red, sweaty, miserable.

He washed his hands. Water soaked his pants.

He looked at himself, and he thought about Linda's words.

*Are you having an erection?*

Like his body was betraying him. Like any discomfort he felt was just his male chemistry making him unstable.

*You're probably PMSing. That's why you're complaining about the temperature.*

He'd said that. He'd actually said that.



# Part Nine: The Warehouse

Marcus's afternoon shift was in the warehouse. He went to the equipment room to grab his safety gear.

The hard hat sat too tight on his head, the inner band pressing into his temples. He adjusted it. Still tight.

He pulled on the safety vest. It was too small across the shoulders. The Velcro barely met. He forced it closed, and it pulled across his chest.

But the strangest thing was the front. There was extra room there—two curved sections built into the vest.

He looked down. It was shaped for breasts.

His broad shoulders pulled the vest backward, making it ride up in the front. The arm holes cut into his armpits. The curved sections hung loose and empty over his flat chest, while the back strained across his shoulders.

He tried to adjust it. It didn't help.

He lifted a box. The vest pulled tighter, restricting his movement. He felt the seams strain across his back.

""You okay?"" his supervisor, Karen, asked.

""The vest doesn't fit.""

Karen looked at him. ""It's standard safety equipment.""

""It's built for..."" He gestured at the curved front.

""It's built for people,"" Karen said. Her voice had an edge. ""Are you saying you need special accommodations? Because that requires paperwork.""

*The vest is too tight across my chest. The PPE isn't designed for women's bodies.*

Sarah had said that. He'd said, ""It's safety equipment. It's unisex.""

*It's not unisex. It's designed for men and labeled unisex.*

He'd told her she was making it a bigger deal than it was.

Now he stood in a vest designed for a body he didn't have, the shoulder straps cutting into his arms, and he said, ""No. I'm fine.""



# Part Ten: The Lunch Break

Marcus stood in the break room, trying to use the vending machine. The buttons were low, at chest height for Sarah, at waist height for him. He had to bend over to see what he was selecting.

His protein bar got stuck. He hit the machine. Nothing.

He went to the microwave. It was mounted on the wall—at eye level for Sarah, at his sternum. He had to crouch to see through the window to check if his food was done.

He grabbed his lunch and sat at the break room table. The chair was too narrow. His hips pressed against the armrests.

He pulled out his phone to scroll while he ate. The screen was still too small. His thumbs kept hitting the wrong letters. Autocorrect kept changing his words.

*Just get a bigger phone.*

That's what he'd said to Sarah.

*They don't make them bigger. This is the standard size.*

She'd shown him. He'd said she was exaggerating.



# Part Eleven: The Pharmacy

After work, Marcus stopped at the pharmacy. He needed razors, deodorant, shaving cream.

He walked down the men's aisle. The razors were on the top shelf. He reached up easily—one of the few things that still worked.

He grabbed a pack. Checked the price.

**$18.99 for a 4-pack.**

He blinked. That couldn't be right.

He walked to the women's section. Similar razors—same brand, similar design. Pink instead of blue.

**$7.99 for a 4-pack.**

He stared.

He picked up men's deodorant. **$9.49.**

Women's deodorant, same size, same brand. **$4.99.**

Shaving cream. **Men's: $8.99. Women's: $4.49.**

Body wash. **Men's: $14.99. Women's: $6.99.**

He stood there, holding a can of shaving cream that cost twice as much, and he felt something hot rise in his chest.

He looked at the labels. The men's products had different formulations—designed for coarser hair, oilier skin, different pH balance. They weren't identical to the women's versions.

But still. His basic hygiene cost twice as much because his body required different chemistry.

*Why do women's products cost more? It's not fair.*

Sarah had said that about razors, about deodorant, about dry cleaning.

*Just buy the men's version then.*

He'd said.

*I can't. It doesn't work the same. Women's razors are angled differently for legs, the deodorant formula is different for our skin chemistry. I need the women's version, and it costs more.*

He'd shrugged it off. Said it was just marketing.

Now he stood in the aisle, holding a blue can that cost $8.99, looking at the pink version for $4.49, knowing he couldn't just buy the cheaper one because it wouldn't work properly on his skin, and he understood.



# Part Twelve: The Walk Home

Marcus left work as the sun was setting. He'd stayed late, trying to catch up on work he couldn't complete while sitting in agony at his too-low desk.

The parking lot was dimly lit. He walked toward his car, aware of how the shadows pooled between the streetlights. The lights were spaced far apart—maybe 100 feet between each pole. Long stretches of darkness.

He heard footsteps behind him. He turned. A woman walking to her car, her keys already out.

Marcus kept walking. The distance between streetlights felt vast. He couldn't see clearly into the spaces between cars. Anyone could be standing there.

He walked faster.

*This is ridiculous,* he thought. *It's a parking lot.*

But his heart was beating faster. The darkness between the lights felt threatening. He couldn't see what was around him.

He reached his car, unlocked it quickly, got in. Locked the doors.

He sat there, breathing hard.

*The streetlights are too far apart. I don't feel safe walking to my car at night.*

Sarah had said that. About her office parking lot.

*It's fine. It's well-lit.*

That's what he'd said.

*For you, maybe. You don't feel unsafe. But I'm looking over my shoulder the whole time. I can't see what's in the shadows.*

He'd told her she was being paranoid. The parking lot had streetlights. It was adequately lit.

But adequately lit for *him*—someone who'd never felt vulnerable walking alone at night.

Now he sat in his car, his hands shaking slightly, understanding that ""well-lit"" wasn't about brightness. It was about *feeling safe*. And the lights were spaced for people who didn't need to see into every shadow, who didn't calculate threat vectors, who'd never been followed.



# Part Thirteen: The Kitchen (Dinner)

They made dinner together. Marcus hunched over the counter, his back screaming. The knife handle was too small. His hand cramped.

Sarah moved around the kitchen fluidly, everything within easy reach.

Marcus chopped an onion. The knife slipped. He grunted in frustration.

""You're being so rough with it,"" Sarah said, not looking up from the stove.

""I can't get a grip.""

""You're just tired.""

He stopped. He looked at her. She was smiling, sympathetic. She meant it.

She didn't see it. The world fit her so perfectly that his struggle looked like a personal failing.

*You're making this a bigger deal than it is.*

He'd said that. Multiple times. About the cold office, the tall counters, the lack of pockets in her work pants, the bright streetlights that gave her headaches.

He'd said it because her complaints seemed trivial to him. Because the world fit him, so when it didn't fit her, he thought the problem was her expectations, not the world.



# Part Fourteen: The Evening

That night, Marcus sat on the couch—a low, soft couch where his knees were higher than his hips. The TV remote was tiny in his hands. He kept hitting the wrong buttons.

Marcus was still sweating. The apartment was warm. Too warm.

""Can we turn down the heat?"" he asked.

""I'm comfortable.""

""I'm hot.""

""You're always hot lately,"" Sarah said, concerned. ""Are you feeling okay?""

""I'm uncomfortable.""

""That's what I mean. You're perceiving everything as a problem. The desk, the chair, the temperature. Maybe you're just having a rough day.""

He stood up. The room swayed. He felt dizzy—from the heat, from the frustration, from the sheer weight of everything being slightly wrong.

""I'm going to bed.""

""Okay,"" Sarah said, still sympathetic. ""Get some rest. You'll feel better tomorrow.""



# Part Fifteen: The Mirror

Marcus stood in the bathroom, staring at his partial reflection. He was bent at the knees, looking at his own face, and he was shaking.

*Nobody's catering to me.*

He'd said that. He'd believed it.

But every chair fit him. Every desk. Every door, every counter, every tool. The office was 70 degrees, and he'd never been cold. The thermostat was set for him, and he'd never even noticed.

He thought about Sarah, sitting at her desk with a space heater under it. He'd thought she was being dramatic.

He straightened up. His face disappeared from the mirror.

He felt a sudden, overwhelming rage—not at Sarah, not at his coworkers, but at himself.

*You don't see it because you've never had to.*



# Part Sixteen: The Return

Marcus woke up with a gasp. His own bedroom. His own bed.

He sat up. The footboard was where it should be. The nightstand was the right height.

He stood. The ceiling felt miles away.

He walked to the bathroom. The mirror showed his full face. He didn't have to crouch.

He turned on the sink. It was deep. The water didn't splash.

He stood there, breathing, his hands gripping the counter.

It fit. All of it fit.

He walked to the kitchen. Sarah was making coffee. The counter hit her at the ribs. She was standing on her toes, trying to reach the cabinet where they kept the mugs.

Marcus watched her stretch. He'd seen her do this a thousand times. He'd never thought about it.

""Sarah.""

She turned, a mug in her hand. ""Yeah?""

""I'm sorry.""

She blinked. ""For what?""

""For last night. For... not listening.""

Sarah set the mug down. ""Okay. Where's this coming from?""

""I had a dream,"" he said. ""Or... I don't know what it was. But everything was the wrong size. The counters, the chairs, the desks. Everything. And when I said I was uncomfortable, people told me I was being irrational. They asked if I was having an erection.""

Sarah's expression didn't change. ""That sounds frustrating.""

""It was. It was humiliating. And it made me realize..."" He looked at the counter. ""You do this every day, don't you? You reach for things that are just slightly too high. You sit in chairs that are just slightly too big. You're cold in offices that are just slightly too warm for me.""

Sarah didn't say anything.

""And when you tell me it's a problem, I tell you it's not a big deal. Because for me, it isn't. It's not a big deal for me because everything fits me.""

Sarah's eyes were shining. ""Yeah. That's it.""

""I'm going to do better,"" Marcus said. ""I'm going to actually listen. And I'm going to help fix it.""



# Part Seventeen: The Adjustments

It started small.

Marcus measured the cabinets in their apartment. He moved the everyday mugs, plates, and glasses to a lower shelf—one Sarah could reach without stretching.

He bought a step-stool for the kitchen and put it in the corner.

He adjusted the mirror in the bathroom, angling it so Sarah could see her full reflection without going on her toes.

He didn't fix everything. He couldn't.

But he bought Sarah a space heater for her office. He didn't roll his eyes when she turned it on.

He stopped saying ""just adjust it"" when she complained about seatbelts.

He started noticing—really noticing—when she had to stretch, crouch, adapt.

And when she said something was uncomfortable, he believed her.



# Epilogue

One day, weeks later, they were in the car. Sarah was driving. Marcus noticed the seatbelt cutting across her neck.

""Does that hurt?"" he asked.

""Every day.""

""Why didn't you say something?""

She glanced at him. ""I did. You said it was adjustable.""

He reached over and tried to pull it down for her. It slid back up.

""Huh,"" he said.

""Yeah.""

He made a mental note: *Look into seatbelt extenders for shorter people.*

Another day, they were shopping together. Sarah picked up a package of women's razors.

""These don't work as well,"" she said. ""But the men's ones are so expensive.""

Marcus thought about standing in the pharmacy, looking at $18.99 razors while the women's version sat at $7.99.

""Get the ones that work,"" he said. ""I'll cover the difference.""

""You don't have to—""

""I know. But I want to.""

It was a small thing.

But it was a start.



And every time he felt the impulse to say, ""That's not a big deal,"" he remembered:

The tiny phone that wouldn't fit in his pocket, that he couldn't type on, that slipped through his fingers.

The seatbelt cutting into his throat that wouldn't adjust.

The safety vest shaped for a body he didn't have.

The manager asking if he was having an erection when he complained about being uncomfortable.

The parking lot with shadows he couldn't see into, where he felt afraid.

And he listened instead.

1qbpkvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doomreads/comments/1qbpkvw/granddad_mask/,Granddad Mask,"

He wakes up and his face feels thick. That’ll be inflammation of some kind, from the alcohol. Dehydration. Very temporary. 



He’s belly-down on the bed, fully dressed. Shoes and everything. The bed still made, sheets almost completely unruffled. His eyes don’t want to open. He must’ve been lying in this position for god knows how long. Most of the night probably. He won’t have moved since he flopped on the bed, whenever that was. Blacked out again. He never used to black out at all, but it’s been happening more and more lately. His immediate thought, after the feeling of his face, is what the hell happened last night. He tries to grab at whatever fragments he can. Alarmingly few. 



He lifts himself slightly. His head feels heavy, too big. And he now notices he has an itchy, unpleasant damp patch on his trousers, stretching down his left leg from the crotch. That’s something else that never used to happen. Not good at all. 



His head really does feel strange. He sits up on the edge of the bed - whose bed is this? - and pats his face. Now he gets it. 



He’s still wearing his costume. This is some relief to him, to realise this. The heavy latex old man mask is still over his head. The gloves are still on too, fat fingers somehow both floppy and stiff, only bending in one place.



What happened last night? The party. It was a fancy dress party. Not here, some other house. He was wearing this grotesque granddad mask that came down right over his head. It went down to the collarbone really. And these long rubbery cumbersome gloves that went halfway up his arms. He didn’t take any of it off all night. He remembers now. 



He made a thing of it in the way he does. A kind of personal joke that only he finds funny. The clumsiness of it all, the hindrance. Making his own evening so much harder purely for the joke. Endurance comedy. It starts funny, then gets unfunny, then eventually gets funny again. That was the idea. 



And everyone else telling him to just take it off, for christ’s sake, and that just making it even funnier. And his announcement that he needed to take a dump and who was going to help him? That did get a laugh, a big one. 



And adding to the joke is that he’s usually so deft and limber. Lean and adept in his movements. His face so expressive. Eyes alive and magnetic, the way they hold a gaze. His whole face communicates without saying a word.



He did take the mask off once, actually. That one time for a short while. 



He tries to pull the gloves off, but they’re not coming off. One set of pliable inept fingers can’t get purchase on the other. He tries the mask, but he can’t find the edge. It’s down by his shoulders. 



He’s wearing a shirt, a fussy formal shirt, part of the costume along with the corduroy trousers and hilarious thick-soled orthopedic-type shoes he bought for £11 from one of those budget shoe emporiums specifically to complete the look. He tugs at the shirt collar. He tries the top button, briefly, knowing it’s useless with these ridiculous gloves on. 



The mouth hole isn’t big enough to grip anything with his teeth, and now he’s feeling a bit clammy and claustrophobic. He pulls again at one hand with the other, but the friction is so strong it doesn’t give an inch. He’s still wearing the damn shoes even. He must’ve just collapsed onto the bed. They left him to it. His head is pounding. He needs a pint of water and maybe a couple of painkillers. He needs to begin the hangover mitigation process, pronto. He can’t do it with this stupid costume on. 



He went with his friends, Vicky and Eileen and Mark. George joined them at the bus stop and they walked together to a tall grey terraced house. Curtains closed, lights within purple and pink and blue. A fancy dress party with no theme, how weird. And him seeing the granddad mask in a shop window earlier that day and finding it so perfectly ghoulish. How lifelike with its cavernous folds and bloodless lips and tiny little eye slits. How much that’ll freak people out. It was genius. 



His phone a smudge on the floor in the darkness. He can pick it up but it’s unresponsive to his fingers’ clumsy overtures. He almost drops it twice trying. It might as well be a roof tile in his hands. 



And the party was a friend they knew not that well, but who was very nice and welcoming. Someone Vicky knew from art college. And her two housemates, also nice and breezy, totally at ease with all these people in their house. And them never even really knowing who he was with his mask on. They’d met him before but they’d never place him just from the name. It was all part of the fun. And Eileen dressed as a nurse. Thick black tights and slip-on loafers. That odd little white hat, where did she get it? Blue uniform neat as a pin. And so snug on her. Just perfect.



He walks stiffly to a mirror on a wall. This is not his house. He’s gone back to someone’s house, fallen asleep, alone, in a spare room. Pissed himself. Now he has to evacuate somehow. Preferably without causing a fuss. He’s in front of the mirror. This garish mask still on his face. Little gap for the mouth. Two deep recesses for two pinprick eyes. He looked like that all night. It was ghoulish alright. Perhaps more ghoulish than funny. The patterned shirt and that wide brown double-windsor tie, a little loose. A little crooked. He pulls at it. At least that comes free. He stuffs it into his pocket then moves onto the landing. Calls out. Hello? His voice is thin and croaky, muffled under the mask. He’s parched. Can’t shake the feeling that the whole house is empty. He nudges a door - those ridiculous rubber fingers bending back at the tips. Another empty room. Down the stairs, almost tripping in these clunky monstrosities on his feet. But by god they are comfy. 



Hello? He doesn’t want to scare anyone. But the house is empty, he knows it now. No creaks, no thumps, burbles, mumbles, nothing. Unearthly silence. Lights are all off too. Where did they go? Out for breakfast? 



Who’s they? Whose place is this? 



The girl. Radient in the crowded kitchen. Sipping a Screwdriver. Glitter on her face, she was Tinkerbell. 



Chemistry was instant. They hogged each other for an hour. Two more Screwdrivers down the hatch. Strong beer for him. That’s when the mask came off. When they kissed. 



Witnesses made whooping noises, teasing. It was a good kiss. Fantastic. She was smiling. The mask went back on. She got the joke. They left together. A few of them, but the others knew really it was all about the two of them together. They must’ve peeled off. Their passage eased by their friends who knew the score. 



But he doesn’t know this for sure. He’s surmising. The curtain of darkness has fallen completely over that last act. There are huge clouds of blankness throughout the night, but these small patches he remembers, drifting towards him from the gloom. 



But leaving the party is the last of it. After that the film reel clatters to blackness in the projector. The end. 



Except it wasn’t of course. The night had more turns in store. Because now he’s here. This doesn’t seem like her house. Not that he would know, but it doesn’t. But then tenants don’t decorate. They move in and position their things and that’s that. Students especially. Was she a student? Yes. Something interesting. Engineering. He asked lots of questions. None of them about the novelty of a woman doing engineering. That would’ve annoyed her. There are probably lots of them doing it. 



You’re a good listener, she said. Well I’m a very bad talker, he said, from underneath the mask. Another laugh. He knew it was funny, though she was laughing because she liked him. He knew that too. 



Downstairs, eerily still and quiet. The others must’ve gone for breakfast. But they didn’t wake him? Or at least try? Maybe they did try. Did they smell the piss? Embarrassed on his behalf. Give him some space, some time, he’ll sort it out on his own and no one need be the wiser. Poor guy. He’s been doing this more lately. Needs to slow down. Not that he’s been speeding up. Maybe the world has. 



He needs to get this fucking mask off. Feels like he’s wearing a diving helmet. It’s chafing his skin. It’s obscuring his view, his range of movement. He can barely see. His head refuses to turn easily. He twists, pivots, little slow-motion pirouettes to take in the space. 



This old sad kitchen. Students really don’t care where they lay their heads. He’s glad to be a working professional so young. Well on the way to owning his own place before they’ll have even graduated. 



Fingers still hopeless against the tight little pearlesque buttons of his shirt. And the mask fixed in place while his shirt is on. And his gloves stuck to the sleeves somehow. He’s going to have to cut this frigging thing off. 



He manages to get a drawer open. Kitchen scissors, chunky things for spatchcocking a chicken. He takes them to the hallway mirror. Best light. This thing feels close against his skin but it must be loose. Must be some phantom sensation from wearing it for so long. How did he keep breathing all night? He’d have been out like a lamp. They left him where he lay. 



He opens the scissors and raises them to the cheek. A hand on each finger hole is the only way to hold them. Now to pierce the thick rubber and not catch the skin. Careful work. He starts low and goes for a scooping, hooking motion. Bladepoint angled upwards and in, hoping for a long gash.



A worm of blood and an unwelcome pinch of pain. He’s got the skin good. Blood running now, down his chin. He drops the scissors, hunts for a cloth, finds a towel. Presses it to his face. 



That is a mean cut. Pain humming. Blood still coming. The towel almost pink right through now. He’ll need a plaster, some gauze maybe. He needs a drink like crazy, should’ve dealt with that first. 



He overturned a chair getting to the towel. Lucky he didn’t go over himself. He’s not trying that again. He should try again. Nip the tip off a finger maybe, get in that way. But he won’t. Doesn’t want to. He’s too shaky for that. Can hardly see what he’s doing. 



Headache pounding, can’t think straight. It would be time to panic but he thinks: they’ll be back soon. They’ve gone for breakfast, or snacks from a corner shop. They can’t be long. They won’t have gone out long without him. Just enough time to clean himself up. Change the sheets. Maybe show himself out. That would be the polite thing to do. Did he get her number? If he leaves will he see her again? Would she want to see him? Old man piss-the-bed? 



He should just leave on his own accord, right now. And go out like this? What a scene. But who cares, no one speaks to each other, no one ever says anything to another person nowadays. Let them think their thoughts. And what would they think? A man in a costume. Probably hungover from last night. Or a prank gone wrong, not so funny in the cold light of day. There goes an unfortunate young man, no doubt one or two more regrets on the docket. He can’t be enjoying this, bless him. Let him get home, get some sleep. 



Did he glue it on? Did someone else? No, they’re not pranksters. Merrymakers, hedonists, halfway to becoming alcoholics, some of them. But not pranksters. Can’t be bothered, too much effort. No time. Too busy having fun. No, this is a mess of his own making.



So let’s go. Let’s get out of here. There’ll be time to rake through events later, when they’re all reunited. His friends filling in the gaps for him. You don’t remember this thing? Or that thing? Wow, you were really out of it.



The front door is locked. Why? He stumbles towards the back door. Locked too. For god’s sake, why? Worried he’d sleep through a burglary? 



There must be keys, keys, keys… Ah, keys right there on the hook. Fiddly work. These ludicrous digits not up to it. He manages to awkwardly thumb them off the hook but they hit the floor with a mocking tinkle. Then he’s down, on one knee. That stretch is something. Jesus, did he sleep funny? Then down on two knees. Two sore knees. He’s aching all over, come to think of it. 



And now a sad little comedy routine of flicking the keys along the floor. It would be hilarious slapstick if it weren’t him, alone and getting desperate. He’s furious now. What a pathetic situation he’s found himself in. One hell of an anecdote, if he ever works up the sense of humour to tell it. Doesn’t feel that way now, but these things take time. Trauma has a half-life. The sense of hardship needs to fade like a bruise before the tale can blossom into its final glorious gleamed and polished form. The worse the predicament, the funnier the anecdote.



The keys skid, those mocking keys, under the fridge and are lost. His urge to be home, to be around people, friends, is threatening to overwhelm him. He is overcome by an absurd wave of loneliness. Aloneness, perhaps is the better word for it. This awful house like a shabby prison.



The living room. Swirling deep blue carpet and burgundy tasselled couch. The wallpaper busy abstract pastels. Fussy faux-brass light fixture mere inches above his head. TV in the corner in which he catches himself, hunched and troll-like, in grey scale. A shadowy inversion skulking across the room. 



A front window opens wide, laterally in the manner of a book. Thank Christ. He can get through it. He tries leg up and over, but the stiffness is too much. These piss-heavy corduroys, the thick-soled shoes. Head first, arms up, diving-style is the only way, undignified as it is. The indignities are piling up. But such is the toll of a night like last night.



Last night. So much darkness. Nothing coming back hardly. What did they talk about? What did she tell him? She wasn’t Tinkerbell, no. She’d come as a bride. A full bridal gown, and the warm glow in the room like sunlight on her face. And Vicky wasn’t there. But she must’ve been, it was her friend holding the party. But he’s sure she wasn’t. Conspicuous by her absence, in fact. Has he blocked her out too? Poor Vicky. 



Face-first on the flagstones. Cold and hard through the mask. Almost toppling over himself like a child’s block tower collapsing. Legs thumping to the ground somewhere to his left. He unkinks and looks up at the sky. Then hefts himself into sitting position, notes that he groused his elbow on the way down. 



Already people are watching him. Passers by frowning unguardedly. One young man, slowing, y’okay? He can barely get a response out, so dry is his mouth. But he waves the guy away, climbing to his feet to show him this is all a misunderstanding. He doesn’t need any help. But that was a real twist he did coming out of that window and he’s picked up a sharp pain down his side. He tweaks it when he moves in certain ways. It twangs like an elastic band. 



What a sorry state he’s in. He should get back into running. He was doing five miles three times a week in the summer. It’s not the partying. He drank as much then. He wasn’t blacking out though. Maybe he’s doing himself an injury in the dark lost hours.



Left or right? Not a clue. No idea really where he is. How far from home. How far from the first familiar landmark. Is there a high street? A park? A bus stop? So much is gone from his head. His memory pulverised by the booze. He chooses left on a hunch. 



Within a few minutes, across the way, a newsagents. He forgot to get a drink before he left the house. Something sharp and fizzy and full of additives will set him right. Maybe some fat and sugar. The guy might have a box cutter to help with the mask. More surgical, another set of eyes. He might even know the way home. 



The bell dings and the overhead lights are too bright, laboratory bright. He fumbles a can, it clonks on the floor and rolls. He bends to fetch it but a girl has got there first, smiling as she replaces it on the shelf in the fridge. He grabs a plastic bottle instead, and at the till pats around his pants - that crotch stain so vivid in this unforgiving light - and finds only flat pockets. No wallet. He didn’t even think. Did he check the bedside table? Just as likely the carpet around the bed. He would’ve tossed it in his stupor, like he did his phone. Well, now he is a prize fool. 



But the man at the till looks at him with nothing but concern. His cheek, it’s still bloody. And the crotch stain. Is it any wonder. 



Are you okay? Your face is bleeding.



It’s not my face, he tries to say. Except it is his blood. I’m fine. He tries to say. How much is intelligible from under the mask, he can’t say. 



Do you want me to call someone? 



He doesn’t even understand the question. He drops the bottle on the counter and vacates. Wrestling with the heavy glass door. Someone running to hold it for him, too late for anything but an ineffective gesture. 



This area is unpromising. A long wide road leading nowhere he recognises. Perhaps right was right. He heads back in the opposite direction. Approaches the house he’s just come from. Ground floor window wide open. Idiot. He should’ve closed it. That is a bad houseguest. Flopped onto our spare bed, pissed his pants, buggered off without so much as a goodbye, left us begging to get raided. He should close it now. He’ll do that now. 



He’s back in the yard, shunting the window shut. He’ll sit on the low wall, get is breath back. Get his bearings. Think think think about what went down last night. How he ended up here.



They kissed and kissed again. Her in her bridal gown. Or a lab coat? Or was she in any kind of fancy dress at all? They went back to hers. Not here though. A big overgrown garden. Tall house, four floors. Handsome, not like this pebbledashed eyesore. They moved on again? At such a late hour? His friends melted away. Vicky gone, off the scene completely. Distant memory. Mark and George laughing on the patio, then gone. Eileen being helped onto the coffee table, doing the twist, then gone. All of them gone. Just him and her.



Then just him.



God he’s tired. He’s exhausted. He mustn’t have slept much after all. Back to hers, then for some reason moving on to here. Clearly a late one. Or an early one, to look at it another way. Perhaps he only caught a few hours. Perhaps this is all the scrambled egg brain effect of sleep deprivation.  



He hears a voice. The voice is familiar. It’s far away, but getting closer. 



What else? What else? What’s he missing? Find your torch, shine a light on the darkness. What’s lurking? What happened? 



The voice. He knows it so well. It is unclenching something within him. He stands from the wall, turns, and sees her approaching. That face. 



They left together. Lay in bed together in the blue midnight hours. 



Such a fresh face. Glowing. She must’ve slept better than him. 



And they woke together. 



And she’s so young. Not young but young-looking. Moreso than he remembers.



She made him breakfast. 



And here she is in the cool morning air. Radiant amidst the grey. Taking his hand. Taking his arm. Moving with him back to that house. The awful little empty dark house. He knows that house.



And they went shopping that day. Then on to the cinema, where they napped off their hangovers. 



She’s looking at him, beaming at him. Holding him close, clutching his arm of all things. She has spare keys. So it is her place after all. 



And they fell in love. That’s right. They fell in love. And she was Tinkerbell that first night. Later she was a bride. She was a bride on that beautiful sunny day. All their friends gathered. And so soon after, almost immediately after, sadness. 



They’re back in the house. The shadowed hall. He feels so weak he could lie on the floor. She’s helping him, guiding him. Perfect her. Eyes deep hazel wishing wells flecked with glinting pennies. Shiny velvety hair like melted chocolate. That face, so immediately familiar but different somehow. His memory of it different.



Vicky dead in a car accident. Gone in a blink, they learned about it the day they got back from their honeymoon. No one wanted to ruin their trip. Poor Vicky.



And Mark and George drifting away. And the two of them not minding, filling their lives with new people, new things. The new house. 



She sits him down at the kitchen table. It feels good to sit. She flicks the kettle on. She knows this place better than he does. 



The new job. Her expensive premium new lab coat, a totemic gift for her burgeoning career, which quickly gathered pace. And him sitting in a chair like this. Not quite like this, cushioned. It swivelled. Seeing his own face in grey scale, a shadowy inversion of his face every morning before turning the computer on. The small square room, one window.



She hands him a tea. Warm in his hands, even through the rubber. The mug in his hands, starting every day with the mug in his hands, on the chair, computer booting up. Secretary knocking, leaning in, good morning. 



A sting on his face. A good sting. Alcohol. Wiped and dabbed tenderly. She’s close to him now. Her eyes, his eyes, parallel. Her smile. Face unlined and perfect.



And then she was huge, waddling around with a big beach ball belly, ready to pop at any moment. And the frantic drive, and the gouging screams, hospital gown tented over the gore like a dignity cloth. And the tiny little red thing, too tiny for this world, hands like mouse claws, whisked away. A tiny pink heart inside a huge glass-domed machine - so unfair we can’t hold him - giving everything his tiny body can to stay here, on this earth with them, but no. 



A miniature casket, proportions all wrong, shining like lozenge in the rain. A marble plaque pressed into the dirt, the two carved dates impossible-seeming. But amidst the eviscerating grief, her belly blooming again. 



Her, with him in the kitchen now, pressing on the plaster. Almost crosseyed as she concentrates. So young. Her skin dewy and plump. Her smile like an angel’s. And then she’s on her feet, walking away, making a phone call. 



And the little thing pudgy and robust and wailing. A curl of slick dark hair. Driving her back home, everything new again. Up at all hours of the night. A beautiful little girl. Just the one, that’s all they managed. 



All the same, her time in the lab is over. Lab coat pushed into the back of a cupboard, then vacuum packed. She’s at a desk now, just like he is. And then she’s not. She’s at home, slow-cooking stews. Pressing shirts and skirts. All that behind her. But his desk gets a bit bigger. And a bigger room to fit it. Two windows now. And the little girl not so little. Suddenly a woman. She looks just like her. Everyone says it. Just like her. 



And there she is, pacing in the hallway. Making a call on his behalf, somehow. For some reason he can’t quite grasp. Will she get the mask off? He’s tried to tell her. Will she get him home?



Their little girl, now a woman, off around the world, returning with a little girl of her own. And her, his Tinkerbell, his bride, getting thin. And getting tired. And stopping on the stairs for breath. And then back to the hospital, all these years later. The same bed, looks like, but no. No rucking pains. No lusty screams. Quiet. Just beeping. Hushed people checking notes, changing tubes. Lots of sleep. Him reading while she drifts. Her waking, confused, reaching for him. Her hand like a clutch of straw in his. 



And yet here she is. Off the phone now. Sat with him, on a chair opposite him, knees pressed together. That smile of hers like an embrace. Shining in this miserable place. He tries to speak. The words aren’t there. The voice isn’t there. 



Then echoing nothingness. No need for all these rooms. The grown woman helps, and her no-longer-little girl helps too. With the paperwork and the phone calls. Men come to pack everything away. These things all around him. They went into the van and ended up here, in this house. He put them into position and that was that. 



She speaks, she says, the nurse is coming. Remember Eileen? She’s on her way. I have to go, granddad. I have to get back to college. But mum will come over tonight. She’ll bring you something to eat. And Eileen will be here any minute. You’ve hurt yourself. Are you okay? Do you feel okay?



But he does not feel okay. He doesn’t want her to leave him. Not again. He wants to go with her, but he can’t. He’s very tired, and sore. And now alone. And the darkness is gathering again, and this mask will not budge.",1,1768305887.0,Doomreads,0,1.0,False

Honestly though seems fitting for how December went. I stopped streaming for 2 weeks to spend time with my family and friends but also to give myself a mental reset. Emotions were kinda of all over the place one minute I would be happy the next feeling like the weight of the world just crashing down on me.  Even though nothing would really happen it just felt off. Now its January and I really feel like things should turn around.  For this coming year I really want to focus up and really try to make streaming my thing.  To be honest I've kept it up this long and seeing the progress has been crazy to say the least. I have been known to pick up hobbies and dropped them within a week but I really do enjoy entertaining.  From making tik toks to just live streaming its been a blast. To think also that im about to hit 300 followers on twitch is also just unbelievable. Meeting new people and just learning about them has also put things in a new perspective for me. So all in all if you end up reading this thanks for taking the time. Im going to try my best to keep up with reddit, its just one of those apps I rarely use. Oh and ill go ahead and leave my schedule for my week under this. I really think streaming for 2 days a week is where I feel most comfortable at, I might up it eventually but thats to be determined.

**Intro:** Thyla is getting all nice and settled in to her new home. There’s just one last thing she has to do before she’s truly integrated into the community. Oh, but that’s going to be quite the challenge, though, isn’t it? Ah, it’s Thyla; she’ll survive. Let’s see how she does it.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Thyla. Farsul Foster Child. Super Foster Failure. Sleepy Lil Thing.**

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\] March 10, 2137**

The change starts small. A little bit of orange starting to filter in. It gradually but consistently gets brighter and brighter until I can no longer ignore it. My eyes are torn from their peaceful rest and thrust into bright, overwhelming daylight. I try to open them, but the brightness is so overwhelming.

I take a look at the wall, and something is off. The texture is unfamiliar. Despite being tightly wrapped by sheets, I shoot upright in this bed and find that-

*Oh, right. I’m in my room, in my home…*

I lay myself back down and sink into the pillow once again.

*My home… This is nice.*

I take a deep breath and enjoy the symphony of wood smells present in the room, but another slight scent is also distinct in the air. Chemical-ish but flowery clothes soap and blue-smelling hair paste.

*This bed smells kinda like Raymond. I know he got a new big bed for him and Zoe, but I still can’t believe he gave me his old soft bed.*

Just as I try and force my eyes to close again in spite of the light streaming in through my windows, I hear clear footfalls coming down the hall towards my door. I don't even bother to pretend to sleep as Raymond silently opens the door and comes up to my bedside with a big smile. He takes a hand and places it under my ear as his knuckles dig into the skin there. I can’t stop a slight whine from coming out as I let the ear massage get me so close back to sleep. But then he stops.

“Mornin’, Thyla. Sleep well?”

“Hmmmm, keep scratching my ears.”

“Oookay.”

He then takes his other hand and pairs it with the first one to scratch all over my head and ears while I tighten myself up even more inside my blankets. This time I am for sure nearly back asleep when he again stops, and I’m brought back to the world with a pat on my snout.

“Get on up and get ready, girly. Don’t want to be late for school now, do you?”

*Schhhhool?* ***SCHOOL!***

I feel my heart plummet and stomach tighten as Raymond reminds me of my impending doom. What tiredness remained inside me is drained instantly and replaced by dread. A small yelp escapes me, and a fire runs right across my back as thoughts of school race through my mind. Raymond’s face scrunches at me as I recover.

“Thyla, are you-”

“Okay, Raymond, I’ll get ready right now.”

He pulls his lips tight and slowly nods as he leaves me alone in my room to get ready. I manage to unwrap myself from my sheets and then land my feet on the floor to head into my own bathroom. I make the shower and dryer part fast so I can spend extra time combing my fur with the special brushes from Madame Paly. I give special attention to the fur on my ears and snout with fur brightener and then, for good measure, brush my teeth and tongue ***twice***.

*Not like Venlil can smell me anyway, but non-Venlils still can.*

With all of my readying up done, I leave my bathroom and then my room and then make my way down the hall with steady, even steps to find Raymond sitting at the counter island that’s by itself in the middle of the kitchen. I try on my own to get into the tall stool next to him, but before I can make my third attempt, Raymond leans over and lifts me under my shoulders into the stool. I look at the countertop right in front of me to see a plate already ready with slices of bread covered in…

“Oh, Raymond! You made ziri-chocolate strayu?! Wait, what’s the brown powder and white crystals? Spiced salt on ziri?”

Raymond just laughs at me as I realize now that his mouth is already full with a bite of his own ziri-strayu. He swallows it with a sip of his coffee stuff and then gestures for me to eat.

“No, no. It is a spice, but it’s not exactly spicy. It’s called cinnamon, and the crystals are white sugar, not salt.”

“Still spicy though?”

“No, not spicy, spiced. Try it.”

*Not spicy like krakotl food but still spiced?*

I pick up a slice and am about to take a big bite when the familiar pressure crushes me yet again. Breaths become harder to take, my hands feel so heavy, and I barely manage to set the slice down as the light of the room seems to gray out around me. Without warning, the world goes dark but also clearer. My nose is quickly overwhelmed by that same clothes soap and hair paste smell. A hand covers my ugly back as another strokes my head.

“Thyla, puppy, please tell me what’s wrong.”

“I-I know you said the school is different, and you said it would be fine, b-but what if it ***isn’t?*** Maybe there are going to be humans there, even human pups, but I ***know*** Venlil don’t like me, and I’ll probably have a Venlil teacher. It’s just going to be… the same…”

“I am fully confident that it will not be the same. I’ve made sure that this school has no discrimination against Farsul or Kolshians or anybody; you will be treated just fine.”

“So what if they can’t hate me because I’m a Farsul? T-they’ll just look at my back and have another reason to hate me anyway…”

Raymond stops hugging me and slowly pushes me away back into my own stool. As he wipes under my eyes, I see him shaking his head at me.

*Exactly! Even* ***he*** *can’t think of a reason they won’t unherd me for being PD…*

“Thyla, just eat your breakfast, all of it, as you don’t want to go to school and think too hard without a full belly. If you do, I have a ***surprise*** for you before we get in the car.”

*A surprise?*

“O-okay, Raymond…”

I turn my attention back to my plate and try to continue to eat. The ziri-strayu is just as tasty as I hoped it would be, and the cinnamon is sweet and just a bit hot tasting. I manage to eat it all pretty fast, but not faster than Raymond, who finishes his and then disappears upstairs. I put away our plates in the dishwasher and then get my schoolbag ready by the door to the garage. Right as I’m about to put my backpack on, Raymond returns with a box wrapped in paper and tied with a bow, and I take it out of his hands as he pushes it into my paws.

“Here’s your surprise; go ahead, open it up.”

*A small box for a surprise? What if it’s a* ***new pad!?*** *Oh wait, I already have a new pad. What could it be then?*

I try my best not to tear the bow ribbon or paper as I unwrap it and then open the lid to the small box. Inside is a folded weird piece of blue cloth with little flowers made of threads stitched into it. I grab one edge of the cloth and take it out of the box and it suddenly unfolds into-

“A… dress? ***A dress!?*** Raymond, you got me a dress!?”

He takes the dress from my paws, and I struggle not to grip it and not to let it be lost from my paws.

“I sure did. Now raise your arms up over your head and tilt your nose up.”

*Arms above my head? Oh!*

I do what he asks, and I have to close my eyes as he lowers the dress down over me, and my arms and head slip into place. With the dress now on, I shake myself to help it settle on my shoulders and arms.

“Woah, it’s really light and comfy. A-and it even has a cutout for my tail! How does it fit me?”

“Remember how I said I needed to get your measurements for the doctor? Yeah, I lied, sorry. Those were for orderin’ this dress.”

I spin in my dress and giggle as it swirls around my knees, and the air still feels nice under the fabric without being too hot on my fur.

“It’s okay, Raymond; those types of lies are good if it means I get ***presents***!”

“Oh, that’s good to remember. That’ll be handy in nine months.”

I spin with my dress a few more times until it suddenly feels heavy and the colors look a bit duller. I feel my ears drop, and my tail follows them as it hits the floor.

“Thyla, girly, you’re lookin’ down again. Come on now, what’s wrong, kiddo?”

*It’s just more attention on* ***me***\*. I’m already different enough.\*

“Everyone will really be looking at me because of this, won’t they?”

“Hey now, you already said it yourself that they’ll notice your back, but a dress? With that dress you control how people see you, and I do not doubt, not even for a moment, that they’ll be seein’ you with only happiness and a ***pinch*** of jealousy at your pretty dress. No one else will be wearin’ somethin’ as pretty as this.”

“No, Raymond, you don’t get it. With this-”

*No me, wait,* ***I*** *don’t get it. It’s like how I was already covering my back with the packs, but with clothes I can make it even prettier, and it makes me look rich! I’ll still have to watch what I say, but now everyone can only see my fancy clothes and,* ***and*** *it shows that I have a human taking care of me that can beat up anyone that is mean. Oh yeah. This is perfect.*

I feel tears run to my face as I open my arms and throw them around Raymond, who quickly squats down to hug me.

“T-thank you so much, Raymond. I love the dress, and I want more of them.”

Raymond only responds with a dry breath in, and after a moment I let him go. He then picks my bag off the floor and hands it to me as we head into the garage to the car. He opens the door, and using two straps stitched into the shoulders of my dress, he lifts me off of my feet and into the car, where I plop down onto the seat. He climbs in, and with a few button presses, we are soaring away towards school. Not Star Lake Primary, not Elder Katyon’s, but my real new school.

\------

After a quick but kinda familiar flight to Mirror Lake City, the hovercar jumps in line with other air traffic and then breaks away down a busy street below to land right in front of a really big building next to where a few of the water canals join in the city. The front doors are surrounded by pups and adults walking to the entrance, but then the adults just wave goodbye and then leave the pups alone, who go inside on their own.

In one last act of betrayal, my heart again takes over and thumps uncontrollably against my chest as I try and open the door to leave Raymond behind and go back to school. Before I can really even get scared again, Raymond hugs me on his own, and I let my head rest on his shirt. He sits me back and pulls my ears straight and down as he stares right at me with big, intense eyes.

“Thyla, look at me when I say this. You are a very smart and kind and happy girl, and I know that you don’t fully believe it, but know that you will go in there and make new friends and have fun and learn new things. Just put on a smile or whatever your tail and ear version of that is, and be polite to your teachers, and do your work quickly, but also be sure to have fun and laugh with some new friends who seem like they want to learn too. And finally, in the rare event that someone in there, be it teacher or student or whoever, does end up targeting you because of who you are, ***don’t*** fight them. Just record it with your schoolpad and bring it home to me, and it will be ***taken care of***.”

*Just be happy and polite. Raymond will help me if people are mean; he’s done it before…*

I flick my tail at him and open the door to finally exit the car, but not before remembering to spin around and give him one last goodbye hug for the day.

“Thank you, Da… ***Ray***mond. Please don’t forget to pick me up.”

“I won’t! Good luck, kiddo!”

And with that the door closes behind me, and I stroll along with the other students towards the school’s front doors. As opposed to Raymond’s head and eyes that need to turn around and around to see, I notice countless looks and plenty of attention coming from pups and parents alike as I walk in my dress.

*Oh! I also just got out of a hovercar in this fancy dress! They totally all think I’m rich and important. I mean, I’m not, or at least I don’t think Raymond is, and I’m not going to tell everyone that I am… but I’m not going to tell them I’m not.*

I go up the steep stairs to the school and give polite ear-tail-bows to anyone staring directly at me. Inside the lobby, I look around and spot the small office where Raymond said I’d have to talk to the worker there to find my class. I walk inside to a small Venlil lady with bright fur dye and metal rings in her ears who can barely see over her desk. I give a bigger bow and tail greeting as I catch her attention.

*She’s funny looking. Like that one human lady on the shuttle off Talsk or that one Nevok business guy who would visit Elder Katyon’s school.*

“Oh, good waking! Now who might you be?”

“G-good waking. I’m Thyla, this is my first day, and I need to know which class to go to… uhm, please!”

“Of course, Thyla! Please just tap your pad here, and I can pull up everything you need. Lovely dress, by the way!”

I feel my snout burn blue as I get inside my pack to pull out my pad.

“Thank you Miss-”

“Miss Vatka”

“Thank you, Miss Vatka; I really like the ring thingies in your ears.”

“Thank you, Thyla! Now let’s see here… You’re in…  Mr. Taren and Mrs. Hartshorn’s class. Oh, you’ll just love them! Now wait here; one scratch and I’ll have one of the final-year teacher assistant students escort you to your classroom.”

I flick my tail in thanks and back away from her desk to wait by the door for an older student to come and lead me away.

*Two teachers? And the one lady has a really weird name, even for a Venlil. Oh, she’s probably not a Venlil then, but what is she?*

After just a moment of waiting, a tall Gojid boy walks in, and he quickly spots me waiting by the door. Miss Vatka also notices him and quickly pipes up.

“Good waking, Borlin, it’s Thyla’s first paw here. Can you please take her to Mr. Taren’s classroom?”

“Of course, Miss Vatka! Please follow me, Thyla.”

Miss Vatka gives a happy whistle, waves her ears at us, and gives a quick shout as we leave her office.

“Good luck, Thyla! If you have to wait to be picked up after school claws, please come talk to me here in my office; I think we can talk ***plenty*** about style and maybe even where you got that dress.”

*Style? Would Raymond let me get ring thingies? Nah. But maybe fur dye?*

I give her my best tail goodbye and follow Borlin out of the room and down the now less busy hallway. As we walk down the hall, I notice Borlin taking looks at my dress between him pointing out different important rooms and places in the school. Finally, he takes a deep breath and mutters a question to me.

“I-is that dress-thing from a human?”

*Hah, I knew he was looking at my dress!*

“Yes, it is! I got it today after eating all of my breakfast!”

“Just for finishing your first meal? Wow… I-is that human your dad or mom or friend or whatever?”

*Hey wait, finishing breakfast is a really easy thing to do to get an expensive present. Maybe Raymond is rich…*

“Raymond? Yeah, he’s my dad—ah, uh, I mean, he’s who found me here, a-and now he’s adopting me.”

“Hm, I’m glad he’s already taking such good care of you…”

*Did I actually just call Raymond my dad? But he’s not my father! Why does my brain keep saying that!?*

After just a bit more walking, we suddenly stop in front of two adults. One Venlil man and one ***human*** lady in a pastel mask?

“Mr. Taren, Mrs. Hartshorn, this is Thyla. Miss Vatka told me to bring her to you. It was nice to meet you Thyla. Have a good paw!”

“Oh, nice to meet you too, Borlin! Umm, hello, Mr. Taren and Mrs. Hartshorn! I-I wasn’t expecting a human teacher.”

I regret saying the words as soon as they leave my stupid mouth as I watch the shoulders and head of Mrs. Hartshorn sink for just a blink before straightening stiff and sad. She doesn’t say a word as Mr. Taren steps in front of her and takes over.

“Good waking, Thyla, as I’m sure you’ve heard many times this early claw. I’m Mr. Taren, and together with my Earth exchange partner, Mrs. Hartshorn, we’ll both be your teachers this season. Unless Mrs. Hartshorn being a human is too much for you to-”

*I knew I made them upset by saying that about her! Agh, stupid!*

“N-no! Being human is good! I live with a human, and he’s adopting me!”

If Mrs. Hartshorn had a tail and ears, I can tell that they’d be wagging faster than I’ve ever been able to wag my own. She nearly pushes Mr. Taren out of the way as she approaches me and speaks up.

“Adopted by a human? Oh, that’s wonderful, Thyla! I’m guessing that’s where you got your beautiful dress?”

*She likes the dress too?!*

“Yes! He gave it to me before school today!”

“Uh oh, sounds like a recipe for you getting spoiled sooner than later. Anyway, I think you’re the last student to arrive today. Is there anything you want to ask Mr. Taren or me before we head in?”

*Anything I want to ask… Hmmm…*

“Oh! Do you have to wear your mask all day, or can you take it off? I like seeing human faces when you guys talk. You all do silly things with your mouth and eyes when you’re excited!”

Mrs. Hartshorn’s shoulders again lower, but rather than sinking, they seem to somehow melt this time, and her head tilts to the side.

“Awww, no, honey. As this is still a public school, I have to keep this mask on as long as the regulations are still in effect. But do you have any other questions?”

Without thinking about her being human, I throw my ears in a proper ‘no thank you,’ and she is somehow able to read it.

“In that case, let’s go in. Follow Mr. Taren and me to the front of the classroom, and we’ll let you introduce yourself to your new classmates.”

Mr. Taren flicks his ears in agreement, and they enter the bustling classroom filled with probably twenty other students. It’s mostly Venlil, but also a mix of one or two Gojid and Zurulians and even a Jaur by a cold air vent. They all quiet down as soon as they see the three of us at the front of the room, and I push down my bubbling panic as all attention is brought on me. Mrs. Hartshorn takes it on herself to start my introduction.

“Good waking, class!”

“Good waking, Mrs. Hartshorn and Mr. Taren!”

“I know we’ve been in the new class season for a herd of paws now, but this paw we’re getting a new student! Everyone, I’d like to introduce Thyla!”

If everyone wasn’t looking at me before, they most definitely were now. I take a deep breath and step slightly forward to be beside Mrs. Hartshorn as I speak.

“G-good waking, I’m Thyla and I’m from Talsk because of the invasion there. I live with a human now by Mirror Lake in a big house, but I still wanted to come here even though it’s a long flight in his hovercar. Anyway, I-I hope we can all be friends this season. Thank you.”

I get a mild set of approval thumps from the class, and Mr. Taren uses his tail to point out the empty desk on the end of a row near the middle of the room. I leave the front of the class and take my place at my new seat for the school season. I see the Venlil boy next to me not even trying to hide his snout-pointing as he stares right at me. 

“So you’re really from Talsk because of the battle? Did you see humans killing people or shooting things?”

*That might be the weirdest thing I’ve ever heard.*

“No? But I guess I did watch in space while they blew up one of the moons and then filled the sky with all those satellite shreds.”

His eyes nearly turn to plates as his square pupils dilate into blocks.

“Woooaaah, that’s so cool.”

“Thanks?”

*It didn’t really feel cool, but I also wasn’t too sad about it. Should I have been more sad?*

He switches his focus away from me and digs into his pack to pull out a weird plastic cube covered in little buttons and switches and spinny things. He holds it out in the open in his paw as he plays with it right in sight of the teachers.

*No, no,* ***NO***\*, I can’t be next to a trouble maker! They’ll get me too whenever they get mad at him!\*

I hiss and growl at him and grab his attention as I point right at the cube.

“I don’t know your name, but you can’t be playing with that cube during class!”

“Why not?”

“W-why not?! Because I don’t want to be too close when you get in trouble for playing with smuggled toys!”

“But Mrs. Hartshorn is the one that gave this to me to use in class; she says it helps me focus when my hands need to do things.”

“Mrs. Hartshorn got that for you?! There’s no way… I-uh, never mind, sorry…”

I tilt my head down into my desk as a rush of blue embarrassment flows to my snout, but just as soon as it comes, I feel it fade as a realization hits me.

*Oh…* ***Oh!*** *This school is going to be very,* ***very*** *different… Awesome.*

Before that date, I was happily bashing Irontoe in Kilroy Stoneskin's mission, I was quite successful doing it. It was probably my favorite activity I could go solo for while brewing myself a coffee in the morning, or while waiting 5/10min for whatever else. It was a happy time.

But the Jan 5 2012 update arrived. Armor rating of enemies in Kilroy's brawling mission matters little, since brawling skills deal armor ignoring damages anyway. but the increase of HP makes it a miserable experience nowadays. Killing enemies is paramount to survival in this mission in hard mode. And if you survive, so does Kilroy (most of the time). But the increased amount of HP makes it pretty much impossible to survive the whole ordeal, marking the demise of Kilroy which makes it even harder when you eventually stand up again.

I beg thee, 2weeks, to somehow make it more manageable to brawl with my long-time friend Kilroy in hard mode. Bring back the delightful memories of fighting the infinite amount of stone summit dwarves, hear again the sweet sweet *klangs* of my brass knuckles brutally massaging Irontoe's chin.

Would really appreciate feedback from people who’ve done similar legs.

I'm traveling solo at a flexible pace aiming to focus on a mix of culture & social energy, some nature, and a few slower stops. I'll be staying in budget to mid-range lodging but not trying to rough it.

**Here's my rough route for now:**

**Mumbai** – arrival, adjust to India, food & neighborhoods

**Ahmedabad / Gir (Sasan Gir area)** – culture + wildlife (lions)

**Goa** – beaches, social vibe, downtime 

**Jaipur** – There for **Holi** (**Mar 2-4**), history, architecture, Old City 

**Kochi / Kerala** – Overnight backwaters stay, slower pace, culture, reset

**Rishikesh and Shimla** – mountains, walking towns, cooler air

**Mumbai** for departure



**Looking for advice:**

\-Any cities here you’d cut or replace for February?

\-Where would you spend extra time vs keep it short?

\-Gir: worth it solo? safari booking tips?

\-Any legs where train vs flight is clearly the better move?

\-Jaipur during Holi — amazing or chaotic for a solo traveler?

  
**If you’ll be in any of these places around Feb and want to:**

\-grab coffee or food

\-explore a city for a day

\-overlap on a short leg of the route

…happy to connect. Not organizing a group trip — just solo travelers crossing paths.

we were drinking wine at her place last week and she just casually drops that she's been crushing up a little bit of her sertraline and putting it in her husband's coffee every morning. for like TWO YEARS. i thought she was joking at first but she wasn't

backstory is her husband has been super depressed for years. like wouldn't get out of bed, stopped being present with their kids, the whole thing. she begged him to get help but he's one of those ""meds are poison, therapy is for weak people"" guys. basically refused to do anything about it

so she just... started doing it without him knowing. she says it's a tiny amount, like a quarter of a pill or something. and according to her it worked?? he's apparently way better now. thinks he ""fixed himself through mindset"" lmao. she just sat there nodding when he said that

i didn't even know what to say. like on one hand that's literally poisoning your spouse right?? but also he's apparently a functional dad again and their marriage is better and she seems happier

she made me promise not to tell anyone but i can't stop thinking about it. am i supposed to report this to someone?? pretend i don't know?? i have to see this guy at bbqs and shit now knowing his wife drugs him daily

idk what i'm asking. i just needed to tell someone

EDIT: yes this is real. no i'm not making it up for karma. we were 2 bottles of wine deep and she just said it like it was nothing. i think she wanted to tell someone for a while and it just came out. idk why she picked me. i wish she didn't honestly",4,1768305451.0,confessions,15,0.57,False

but oh how those first sips hit after having quit for 4 years, the sweet delicious unearned dopamine making everything feel right with the world. and it’s funny how it snuck back in again, got moved to the morning shift and had a sip of iced green tea one day when i was dog tired. can you believe that’s all it took? well it was, because that one sip turned into more sips that turned into matcha that turned into dabbling with coffee again (but it made my insides feel like a dirty ash tray), then settling on highly caffeinated pre workout and ending up at 600+m a day :/

so here we are, a year and a half later after being back on it, and im burnt out. my body is pissed. and im done, again. quit cold turkey a bit over a month ago.

and it’s got me thinking. what is it about this stuff? like what is it about that way it makes me feel that once i have it i want to chase it forever? and then i realized, caffeine is an illusion. it is a deceiving menace that highjacks my brain chemistry and makes me think that everything is great after that first sip. but then that little bitch turns around an hour later and steals my peace, my joy, and my purpose. 

let’s be real quitting cold turkey in the middle of the busiest time at work was wild but i couldn’t go on any more. and dude cold turkey from 600m has been so dumb. but little by little the anhedonia is lifting and it’s so good to feel chill again. it’s good to feel like me again.",5,1768305300.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Outlines, beat sheets, save your editing for later. They didn't get me where I needed to go. I found the whole thing paralyzing, honestly. I would sit there staring at a blank document, having entire conversations with Al about structure and plot points, burning hours before writing a single word. I'd rather just start somewhere and figure it out as I go - at least I'm creating something, not just planning to create.



My goals, so you understand:



1\\. Actually finish pieces instead of endlessly preparing to write them.



2\\. Make the process feel natural instead of forced.



3\\. Stop being afraid of the blank page (that is not expecting fear to vanish, but expecting myself to find a way around it that actually works).



Here is what I discovered completely by accident.



\*\*Step 0 (Pre-step)\*\*: I stopped trying to write at all. Instead, I opened up my phone while walking around, grabbed a voice-to-text app, and just started talking. Like I was explaining my idea to a friend at a coffee shop. No structure, no outline, just talking through what I wanted to say. Rambling about the concept, the examples, the stories I wanted to include.



\*\*Two reasons this is powerful\*\*: First, speaking bypasses the internal editor that freezes me up when I type. My fingers hesitate. My mouth doesn't. When I talk, ideas flow because that's how humans naturally communicate. I'm not performing ""writing"" - I'm just explaining something I'm excited about.



\*\*Second reason\*\*: I already have raw material when I sit down to shape it. The engine isn't just warm, it's already been running for twenty minutes. I have paragraphs of spoken thoughts that captured my energy and genuine voice. Now I'm editing and organizing, not creating from nothing.



\*\*Step 1 (speak naturally, shape intentionally)\*\*: So I have this rambling voice-captured mess, and I begin working with it. Sometimes I feed it into an Al and ask it to organize the structure while keeping my voice. Sometimes I read through it myself and pull out the strongest bits. Last night, I turned a 10-minute voice ramble into an 800-word piece in about 30 minutes of shaping.



\*\*Why this step works for me\*\*: When I start with my natural speaking voice, the writing feels alive. It sounds like me, not like I'm trying to sound writerly. I'm not anxious about whether I can write well - I'm just having a conversation that I'm now polishing. This means I'm no longer terrified to start. This means I published something on WeChat this morning that I would have spent three days procrastinating on with the old method.



\*\*The validation piece\*\*: I'm testing this theory at a hackathon this weekend. Maybe this only works for me. Maybe it works for anyone who finds typing to be work but speaking to be natural. Maybe we've all been fighting the wrong battle - not learning to overcome writer's block, but finding an input method that doesn't create it in the first place.



\*\*TLDR:\*\* Traditional writing methods kept me stuck in preparation hell. I accidentally discovered that speaking my ideas out loud first, then shaping that raw material, eliminates the paralysis of the blank page. The whole thing feels natural now, which means I actually finish pieces, which means (I hope) that I will eventually build a body of work instead of a graveyard of outlines.",0,1768305213.0,writers,6,0.31,False

This is probably a very long shot, but I have to try.

It was 2 years ago, but it was such a unique taste. Now I’m trying to find out which beans or coffee they use (if I use the correct terminology, don’t know what the official Italian way is).

Does anybody know thus or can help me out finding it, would love to try get the same beans delivered some way to my own country.",1,1768305159.0,Venezia,0,1.0,False

1/1/26: We both arrived about the the same time at Heathrow. I arrived about an hour before and utilized the lounge which was very sparse but good place to hang out. We took a taxi to the Bankside Marriott ($155) more expensive than I was expecting but made it easy. Luckily our rooms were ready when we checked in around 10 am or so. We immediately headed out and walked along the river towards the London Eye. We had a 1 pm reservation. The eye was fine and line moved quickly. We wondered around a bit more before (Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, etc.) going back to hotel. We then hit Doggett's for a pre-dinner drink and then dinner at the Blackfriar. Cool spot for a good pub dinner.

2/1/26: Up early and off to see the changing of the guard. We posted up at Wellington and then walked over to Buckingham Palace, very crowded. We next did afternoon tea at Fortnum & Mason, not my thing but it was a fun (expensive) experience. We then wandered around hitting Picadilly Circus, Leicester Square holiday market, Trafalgar Square, Covent Market, and lastly a walk by St. Paul's on way back to hotel. Dinner was at Hawksmoor, boy wanted steak. Good experience but also pricey. Hit a couple pubs after including the Rake and Anchor.

3/1/26: Stopped at Monmouth Coffee in Borough for a quick coffee and snack. Then off to Tower of London at 9 am. Spent a couple hours there touring and then off to London Bridge tour, where we spent about 90 minutes or so. We then headed to Borough Market to explore and get lunch. It was packed but managed to get a sandwich at the Black Pig (lives up to the hype). Headed back to the hotel and then off to dinner at The India-Monument. Great food and service. We then headed to the Sky Garden for a drink. Nice view but overpriced drinks.

4/1/26: Walked around in Soho and grabbed some bagels before heading to Tottenham for football match. Great experience at game. We had to buy the hospitality tickets in order to get tickets probably not worth the price but it was a great experience and an easy train ride. Headed back to hotel after a long day (room service for me), son and girlfriend ended up at Nando's. He loves that place for some reason - they used to be in our home town. To each their own.

5/1/26: Up early to catch 6 am Thameslink train from Blackfriar to Gatwick for flight to Dublin where we spent another 2 days.

I've always had the opinion, that the more automatic the machine is, the worse the coffee tastes like. I like an espresso that isnt bitter and I like to make a decent flat white.

I've considered to upgrade to a more expensive model (3,000-5,000 USD range) however I've heard that these more expensive (and perhaps better quality-coffee-machines?) are waaaaayyy more time consuming in terms of continious maintenance?

I want:

\- A good quality espresso machine

\- Budget 3-5,000 USD

\- I prefer a machine where the grinder is integrated

\- I dont want a lot of maintenance.

\- I dont want to spent an enourmous amount of time on each cup; grinding, stamping, weighing the amount of coffee etc. etc. etc. Spending some time is OK, but not too much.

Any suggestions?

One random thing I changed halfway through helped my interview performance.

Used to drink coffee right before interviews thinking it'd help me be alert and sharp but it did not lol, I was more anxious, talking too fast or interrupting people by accident, generally feeling on edge

Around interview 7 or 8 I run out of coffee and didn’t have time to go to the store. Little background info, when I stopped smoking I chewed gum and it helps with focus, I used to chew one called zyn, now I tried one called bizz that I had in my drawer, did it about 20 min before calls instead, it's got a nicotine analog so in my head is better. But you can also try medicines for focus or vitamins or something like that instead of coffee.

Difference was pretty noticeable for me... felt way calmer during interviews, could think more clearly before answering technical questions, wasn't dealing with that anxious coffee energy that makes you talk way too fast. Still felt focused just in a more controlled way if that makes sense.

Obviously won't magically get you through interviews if you're not prepared and might not work for everyone but if you get anxious or jittery from coffee before important calls, worth trying a different approach maybe.

Other thing I changed was doing a 10 min walk right before to burn off nervous energy and having water nearby during calls. Small stuff but added up to feeling more in control.",4,1768304123.0,RemoteJobs,0,1.0,False

Untill one night/morning I was sleeping on my couch as I usually do and I wake up to the friend with his hand in my fu*king pants, I'm shocked to say the least so I imagine the look on my face was something of the shocked nature. He looks at me and says ""I'm going to get coffee"" so fucking awkward but obviously mf bf, even tho he's a shitty bf, he'd still be fu*king pissed about that and loose it right then and there and probably kill the friend. I don't want my baby to have her daddy in jail and just being in shock I stupidly didn't say anything..... To anyone. I didn't expect to see him around anytime soon....buy then Sometime in the next few weeks mother fu*kers back. NOT HAPPY but can't get mad at my bf bc well I didn't tell him(which I of course regret) ..... It happens AGAIN twice actually....I wake up to the same thing. Now my brain is naturally REALLY good at blocking shit out I don't want to remember so I don't exactly remember how those times went even tho it was in the last 60 days.

1qboxck,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/1qboxck/starting_30mg_duloxetine_feeling_great_overall/,"Starting 30mg Duloxetine - Feeling great overall, but have sudden bouts of dizzyness/fainting","Hello everyone,

I had problems with major depression, crippling insomnia and a bit of anxiety for about 6 years now. I tried two SSRI's which didn't help much and now I'm on 37,5mg Mirtazapine for 5 years which helped great with insomnia and quite a bit with anxiety. The antidepressant side of Mirtazapine has never really been great for me, I assume most of the mood stabilizing came from getting good quality sleep constantly and the last 5 years things went actually quite well.

For the last year, my depression went downhill severely because of a grueling workplace and family illnesses, also anxiety started to get more intense. My psychiatrist suggested to try an SNRI - 30mg Duloxetine alongside the 37,5mg of Mirtazapine. (The combination is also known as ""Limerick rocket fuel"")

I started with 30mg Duloxetine 14 days ago and for the first week or so I had literally zero side effects. Also after 5-10 days I noticed great daily improvement overall: The anxiety went down quite a bit, I feel more energized and thinking feels ""clearer"". 37,5mg Mirtazapine made me a bit sedated, and Duloxetine feels overall like it complements Mirtazapine quite nicely. A couple days ago I really thought to myself ""man, I haven't felt that great in quite some time"".

Now after 12-14 days, I feel sudden bouts of intense dizzyness coming up. Unfortunelaty this got so bad at work on Friday that I fainted after getting up from a chair, leaving colleagues quite concerned because I had to be catched from two people and was unconscious for a couple seconds. But this day was also not my best from the get go... I had only slept for 3 hours, took the Duloxetine on an empty stomach, didn't have breakfast and forgot my lunch box for work, so I also didn't eat for at least 16h, only coffee and water.



I went to my GP who did a ECG, heart ultrasound and bloodwork was all perfectly fine.

I'm fit and normal weight, I go to the gym somewhat regularly and generally don't have problems with too low or high blood pressure.

I'm assuming this is a side effect of the new pills, So I'm unsure how to progress now.

Since I'm otherwise doing really well with Duloxetine and have no other side effects, I'm unsure if I should keep trying it for at least a couple more weeks and hope this just a side effect while starting and it'll go away? I could work from home during that time so I'm not too concerned of this coming up again, but I also think fainting is to be taken quite serious, especially when I'm not at home.

There were no big announcements, no creator challenges built around it, no obvious promise of reach. Yet quietly, the platform introduced something it had been moving toward for years: a space where discovery is driven not by algorithms, but by people you already know. 

For brands, this changes how Reels can work. Friends’ Reels doesn’t reward polish or scale but relevance, timing, and reactions.

# What Is the Friends’ Reels Tab?

Friends’ Reels sits next to the main Reels feed on Instagram. Instead of showing content recommended by the platform, it displays Reels that were liked or commented on by people you follow. This is somewhat similar to the main Instagram feed that is now split into the Following, Favorites, and algorithmically driven feed. 

https://preview.redd.it/lia1eilhp3dg1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ef48814554d77bd9578acee654dbdc1a0853c04

    💡Note: The Friends' tab in Reels is only available in the Instagram mobile app. 

In other words, the signal isn’t “Instagram thinks you’ll like this.” The signal is that someone you know interacted with this, so you might be interested to take a look. 

Instagram reinforces that behavior by pushing the reply bar to the front of the interface. The app actively encourages you to respond to your friend’s interaction, such as commenting back, replying in DMs, reposting, or continuing a conversation that has already started elsewhere.

This tab has been live for about a year, and its function has remained consistent: spark engagement through social context rather than volume.

# How Reels End Up in Friends’ Reels

The Friends’ Reels feed reacts to two actions: likes and comments. Saves, reposts, and watch time don’t surface content here. That detail matters: a Reel can perform modestly in the main feed and still show up frequently in Friends’ Reels if it triggers visible reactions from real followers.

This is one reason highly produced brand videos often miss this tab entirely. They may be watched, but they’re rarely interacted with. Meanwhile, a simple clip that invites a response (agreement, disagreement, recognition, provocation) travels further in this space.

# Why Friends' Reels Tab Is Useful for Brands

Friends’ Reels operates on trust by association. If a Reel appears there, it comes with an implicit endorsement: someone I know thought this was worth reacting to.

For brands, this creates a different kind of visibility:

* The viewer is already primed to engage, not just watch
* The interaction often continues in comments or private messages
* The content feels conversational rather than promotional

A coffee brand posting a Reel about brewing tips may struggle to stand out in the main Reels feed. The same Reel, liked by a barista someone follows, carries more weight in Friends’ Reels. The context changes how the content is received.

# Content That Works Best in Friends’ Reels

Friends’ Reels favors content that feels personal, funny, and relatable. 

Behind-the-scenes clips perform well here, especially when they show process rather than results. A SaaS company sharing a short Reel about a feature that didn’t make it into production is more likely to get comments than a clean product demo.

Opinion-based Reels also travel further. For example, a video editor posting “Most brands cut their videos too late, and here’s why” invites agreement or pushback. Either reaction is enough to surface the Reel in Friends’ Reels.

Educational content can work, but only when it leaves room for response. A Reel that explains everything rarely gets comments. A Reel that ends mid-thought or frames the insight as debatable often does.

Memes are another way to boost engagement quickly. Most people open their Instagram app and land on the Reels tab because they want to escape from their daily routines, and funny content often posted as Reels gives them that. Every industry and niche has jokes and humor; you just need to find yours and make a few Reels showcasing something funny and relatable. For instance, social media agencies often make videos ridiculing the most common stereotypes about social media managers and marketers. Even if such clips get the biggest response from their colleagues, the overall reach of their account is growing, thus allowing them to become visible to more people, including potential customers and employees. 

You’ll see how ‘repostable’ such clips might be! 

What do people love to watch on social media? Memes, unboxing clips, jokes, reactions... In fact, unboxing ranks among the top 20 most-watched, alongside ASMR, product reviews, reactions (in comedy), and challenges.

# How Brands Can Encourage Friends’ Reels Visibility

There is no direct way to “post for Friends’ Reels.” The only lever is engagement, and that has to come from people, not tactics.

The opening seconds matter. Reels that start with a clear point of view or observation give viewers something to react to immediately. Questions help, but only when they sound like something a person would actually ask another person.

For example, “Would you use this feature?” feels like a survey. “Why do so many people still edit videos this way?” might be a better opening, since it feels like a conversation starter.

💡Take a look at the example below: even a product or a how-to video might feel relatable and funny thanks to the right (in this case, provocative) opening:

Some brands also see results by involving employees or close collaborators, not as amplifiers, but as participants. A thoughtful comment from someone connected to the brand often sparks further replies, which increases the chance of the Reel appearing in Friends’ Reels feeds.

# Friends’ Reels and Community-Led Growth

Unlike the main Reels feed, Friends’ Reels doesn’t scale endlessly. Its strength is density, not reach.

This makes it especially relevant for brands building smaller, focused communities: niche tools, local services, creator products, educational platforms. In these cases, repeated exposure among the same network of followers builds familiarity faster than broad discovery.

A design tool brand, for instance, might notice that the same Reel keeps resurfacing in Friends’ Reels among designers who follow each other. The Reel becomes part of an ongoing discussion rather than a one-off post.

# Repurposing Long-Form Content for Friends’ Reels

Long-form videos, such as podcasts, interviews, webinars, often contain moments that invite reaction, but those moments are rarely the highlights.

Friends’ Reels favors clips that feel unfinished in a good way: a strong claim, a sharp observation, a sentence that invites a reply. There’s no need for polished, professional production. 

This is where tools like [AI Video Cut](https://www.aivideocut.com/) fit naturally. Instead of pulling “best moments,” brands can extract segments where someone hesitates, challenges a common idea, makes a viral-ready joke, or frames a problem without fully resolving it. These clips don’t explain everything. They give viewers a reason to respond.

A podcast clip that ends with “This is where most brands get stuck” is more likely to generate comments than one that neatly wraps up a point.

https://i.redd.it/4w1g7li0q3dg1.gif

https://preview.redd.it/2cx6png2q3dg1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=79db730d7665bbfddaa8e2a3998acc5b52238a8e

The most common mistake is treating Friends’ Reels as another distribution channel.

Highly polished ads, trend-driven templates, and generic motivational content rarely trigger the kind of interaction this tab relies on. Comment bait is just as ineffective. Users can usually tell when a question exists only to inflate engagement.

Friends’ Reels rewards content that feels like it was made for people, not performance metrics.

# How to Measure Reels’ Success Beyond Views

Friends’ Reels tab rarely delivers high view counts. That doesn’t mean it’s underperforming.

Brands should pay attention to:

* Comment depth rather than quantity
* Replies that move into DMs
* Repeat interactions from the same users

A Reel seen by 2,000 people can be more valuable than one seen by 50,000 if it leads to conversations, follow-ups, or referrals.

If your content gives people something to react to, and a reason to attach their name to that reaction, it has a place in this feed. If it doesn’t, no amount of optimization will push it there.

# Good to Know

# Can brands directly post to the Friends’ Reels tab?

No. Content appears there only when someone likes or comments on a Reel. Brands have no direct control over placement.

# Is Friends’ Reels useful for new accounts?

Less so. The tab relies on existing social connections. It works best for brands that already have an engaged follower base.

# Do comments matter more than likes?

Both matter, but comments tend to spark follow-up interactions, which increases visibility within connected networks.

# Should brands change their Reels strategy because of this tab?

Not entirely. Friends’ Reels works best as a complement to a broader Reels approach, not a replacement.

# Can AI tools help optimize content for Friends’ Reels?

Yes, when used to identify moments that invite reaction rather than moments that simply perform well.",1,1768303468.0,combin,0,1.0,False
1qboujf,https://www.reddit.com/r/brussels/comments/1qboujf/somebody_to_alternate_athome_coworking/,Somebody to alternate at-home coworking,"Hello,

I’m looking for someone who works remotely and would like to do alternating at-home coworking: some days at my place, and other days at yours, during workdays. The idea is to work side by side (each on our own tasks), with coffee breaks and conversation.

Why?  
I work from home and I’d like some company to chat during breaks and to break up the routine and monotony, which helps to stay productive. Working alone at home can make it harder to concentrate; simply having another person present creates a more stimulating setting.

I don’t want to go to a coworking space: I often find the atmosphere too distracting and, for now, it’s not a budget I want to spend.

Location:  
I live in 1030 Schaerbeek, Rue Paul Devigne. I’m sharing the avenue because I’m ideally looking for someone who doesn’t live too far away, so the back-and-forth is easy day to day.  
The apartment has all the basic amenities for working from 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.: kitchen, moka, fridge, heating, fiber internet, etc. There’s a bedroom and a living room; we can work in the living room (desk, table, sofa) . There are also possible spots for more private calls (balcony or hallway).

What I’m looking for:  
• Frequency: Monday to Friday (workdays)  
• Hours: 8:30 a.m. – 6:00 p.m.  
• Noise / calls: occasional calls and video meetings are OK, but the goal is to keep a fairly calm atmosphere. Music is fine at a reasonable volume. On my side, I tend to use headphones.  
• I’m open to extra activities during lunch breaks or after work: video games, sports, a walk, going to the gym, etc. But it’s not necessary.  
• Basic ground rules (friendly living):

* Respect each other’s space and work.
* Cleanliness: no shoes inside, wash what we use, take care of the furniture.
* Non-smoker: my fiancée can’t stand the smell of tobacco.
* Meals: no problem eating on site and using the kitchen for simple, occasional prep. I prefer that everyone prepares their own meals at home (I’ll use your kitchen as little as possible).

Lastly, I think it’s important to be able to trust each other and to have a good feeling. Each person’s home is a personal space: I want both of us to feel comfortable, safe, and at ease.

A bit about me:  
I speak Spanish, English, and French. I’m used to different cultures: I’ve lived in Peru, France, Spain, and Finland.  
I’m a developer at an industrial computer vision startup. I like dogs, judo, geopolitics, finance, economics, math, etc.

Interested?  
If the idea resonates with you, send me a private message: we can start by chatting a bit (and possibly meeting) to see whether the rhythm and atmosphere work.",6,1768303419.0,brussels,5,0.8,False

I Just Got a Call from Extension 000.,"​I work the graveyard shift for Pacific Grid, a utility sub-station tucked away in the rain-drenched woods of Oregon. It’s a dead-end job in a concrete monolith that smells of ozone and old coffee. My job is simple: monitor the grids and answer emergency calls from the field. Most nights, the only thing I talk to is the silence.

​Last night, at 2:47 AM, the silence broke.
​The console on my desk didn’t just ring; it shrieked. I looked at the caller ID, expecting a frantic lineman or a disgruntled customer. Instead, the screen flickered with a message that shouldn’t have been possible: ""INTERNAL EXTENSION - 000"".

​My blood turned to ice. Extension 000 belongs to the sub-basement server room. That floor was welded shut back in the 90s after a catastrophic flood. There isn't even a functioning phone line down there anymore.
​I picked up the receiver, my knuckles white. ""This is Ethan. Who is this?""

​At first, there was only the sound of rushing wind—a howling, violent gale that seemed to roar through the earpiece, even though the air in my office was deathly still. Then, amidst the static, I heard a metallic click.
​Click. Click. Click.

​It was the rhythmic sound of a Zippo lighter being flicked open and shut. I looked down at my own hand. I was fidgeting with my Zippo, a nervous habit I’ve had for years. I stopped instantly. The sound in the phone continued for one more second, then echoed my silence.

​""Who is this?"" I demanded, my voice cracking. ""Some kind of prank?""
​A voice answered. It was deep, gargled, as if the person were speaking through a mouthful of silt and stagnant water.
""Ethan... do you remember the basement?""
​I couldn't breathe. The room felt like it was shrinking.

​""The water is rising, Ethan,"" the voice whispered. It sounded wet. Distant. ""You didn't open the door that day. You were so afraid of the dark, weren't you? You left me in the dark.""

​In 2005, my younger brother disappeared in the cellar of our farmhouse during a flash flood. The police said he’d been swept into the drainage pipe. But I knew. I remembered the frantic scratching on the cellar door that night. I remembered being too paralyzed by fear to turn the latch.

​""This isn't funny,"" I hissed, tears stinging my eyes. ""How do you know about my brother?""
​Suddenly, the voice shifted. It lost its watery rasp and became clear. Perfectly clear. It was my voice. My exact pitch, my exact inflection.

""I’m not your brother, Ethan,"" the voice said with a chilling calmness. ""I’m what you left behind to become part of the dark.""
​Then, I heard it. The building’s industrial elevator—the one tagged 'Out of Service' for a decade—started to groan. I heard the cables straining, the heavy metal box ascending floor by floor.
​Ding.

​The sound of the elevator doors opening in the hallway outside my office echoed perfectly through the phone line.
​Thump... drag... thump... drag...

​Something heavy was being pulled across the linoleum floor. I turned my eyes to the grainy CCTV monitor. In the dim, flickering light of the hallway, a shape emerged from the elevator. It was vaguely human, but its limbs were impossibly long, bent at angles that defied anatomy. It moved with a sickening, twitching gait.

​It was holding an ancient, rotary telephone handset to where its ear should have been. A black cord trailed behind it, disappearing into the dark maw of the elevator shaft, stretching all the way down to the flooded basement.

​The creature tilted its head toward the camera. It had no eyes, no nose—just a wide, jagged mouth that remained frozen in a silent scream.

​The voice in my ear spoke again, synchronized with the movement of the creature's jaw on the screen:
""I’m in the hallway, Ethan. Will you open the door this time? Or should I use my key?""
​I looked down at my desk. My office keys, which had been sitting next to my coffee just a minute ago, were gone.

​At that exact moment, I heard the unmistakable sound of metal sliding into the lock of my office door. The call was still active. The timer on the screen began to count down... but it started from zero and went into negative seconds.

​The door handle began to turn.

The doorknob turned with agonizing slowness. Whatever was on the other side wasn't in a hurry; it knew I had nowhere to go. My office was a windowless concrete box, and that door was the only way out.

​I glanced at the phone screen. The timer now read -01:14. The seconds were ticking upward in the negative, as if time were bleeding backward, or as if I were slipping into a different kind of ""now.""

​""Ethan..."" The voice came from behind the door this time, not through the phone. It was wet—a gargling, rhythmic sound, like someone trying to speak with lungs full of silt. ""Open the door. It’s cold out here, just like it was that day.""

​I backed away until my desk hit the rear wall. I scrambled frantically for anything to use as a weapon, my fingers closing around a heavy pair of industrial shears and a steel letter opener.

​The knob stopped turning. A sudden silence followed—a silence far more terrifying than the scratching. Then, I heard a sound from below. From under the gap of the door.

​A dark liquid began to seep into the room. It wasn't oil, and it wasn't blood. It was stagnant, brackish water. It smelled of dead fish and rusted iron. The water began to flood the carpet with an impossible speed.
​Suddenly, the phone shrieked again. I picked up the receiver instinctively.

""Can you feel the chill, Ethan? That’s the feeling that stayed with me for years.""
​""I’m sorry!"" I screamed, tears stinging my eyes. ""I was a kid! I was scared!""
​""Fear isn't an excuse,"" the voice hissed. But this time, I felt a cold breath directly against the back of my neck.

​I spun around. No one was there, but my office chair was soaking wet. It was dripping salt water, and the leather was stained as if someone invisible had just been sitting there. On my computer screen, old files began to open on their own—photos from my childhood. Photos I never took. Photos of me sleeping, and in every single one, my brother was standing in the shadows behind me.

​At that moment, the door didn't break; it began to decay. Rapid, impossible rust ate through the metal. Holes formed in the steel, and through one of them, I saw the eye.

​It wasn't human. It was wide, pale, and lacked a pupil—like the eyes of a deep-sea fish that has never seen the sun. It watched me with a cold, predatory intelligence.
​""You’re not my brother,"" I whispered, raising the shears. ""My brother is dead.""

​""Dead?"" The voice came from the phone, from behind the door, and from inside my own skull simultaneously. ""I didn't die, Ethan. I just... changed. And now, the Manager wants to meet the new hire.""

​The only lightbulb in the room exploded. In the absolute pitch black, I heard the door finally disintegrate. The water was at my knees now. I felt a long, ice-cold hand—fingers far too thin and far too many—wrap around my ankle. It pulled with a strength that felt like the weight of the ocean, dragging me toward the floor, which no longer felt like concrete, but like thick, suffocating mud.

​The last thing I saw before I was pulled under was the phone screen. The timer read -20:05.
​The year my brother went missing.

​I woke up slumped over my desk. Sunlight was filtering through the small hallway window. I was drenched in sweat, my heart hammering against my ribs. ""A dream,"" I whispered, exhaling a breath I felt like I'd been holding for twenty years. ""Just a nightmare.""

​I reached for my personal cell phone to call my wife, but my hand froze.
There was one missed call from 2:47 AM.
It was from a number I hadn't seen in two decades—the landline to our old farmhouse, a house that had burned to the ground years ago.

​And resting under my phone was a small patch of wet, green moss and my Zippo lighter... covered in thick, heavy rust, as if it had been sitting at the bottom of a well for a lifetime.",4,1768303381.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

*My partners scolded me for gaslighting in [yesterday’s post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/comments/1q9xtod/shakyamuni_buddha_the_teacher_praises_the_devoted/) about what had taken place after the Bills’ victory on Sunday’s wild-card game. The four of us don’t drink because of our addiction recoveries and/or low tolerance thresholds, but Dee and Eulogio, without hesitation, had spontaneously joined the crazed drunken crowd in marching “au naturel” to the pool and jumping in. Guy and I hurried home with the children, trying to shield them from the sights.*

*What I had left out, the reason I was called to task, was that after we put the kids to sleep, we heard a crowd chanting “Guy and Julie! Guy and Julie! Come out, come out, wherever you are!” We looked out of the window and there was a crowd of clothing optional clients approaching the RV in the freezing weather. And the crowd was led by Dee and Eulogio!”*

*Guy told me: “Besides Dee and Eulogio, they are all drunk and won’t remember a single thing tomorrow morning. We don’t want them to wake up the children! I’ll go first while you watch the kids. Then we will switch places.” And with that, he went outside into the cold wearing only his prosthetic foot. There were cheers outside! He came back after five minutes of glory and said it was my turn. So I swallowed deeply, hoped the night would hide my blushing face, and walked outside. When I lived in Berlin there was somethi called [Freikörperkultur (“Free Body Culture”)](https://www.haunt.travel/post/where-to-get-naked-in-berlin) and there it was, right in front of our home. When I went outside there were cheers of “Julie! Julie!” and they opened up a path for me to walk through. Yes, I was walking through the gauntlet. What cold?*

*So that’s the full story. We all walked back into our home laughing and laughing and warmed ourselves up under some heavy blankets.*

*But yesterday morning, Coffee Hour was jammed with happy people. I have exactly no idea what “test” we had passed. Nobody talked about it. Perhaps, as Guy suggested, they were all under the influence and don’t remember themselves. For the first time I felt fully at home with our ~~clients~~, I mean, friends.*

Let me block all of that out and resume studying Daisaku Ikeda’s Gosho lecture in the January Living Buddhism, [Courage—Your Determination to Win in This Moment Can Change Everything](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/courage-your-determination-to-win-in-this-moment-can-change-everything/). Today it's the fifth section, “This Moment Determines the Eternal Future.”

I’m kinda overwhelmed with my tiny little life in a tiny little RV in a tiny little park outside of a tiny little town. Now, just what I need, “The pains and trials of millions of kalpas” (OTT, 214). Do I really have to undertake “eons of painful, arduous effort” in order to attain enlightenment? Sorry, not for me.

Daisaku Ikeda provides Nichiren’s alternative:

>But in a dramatic departure, Nichiren Daishonin teaches that when we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and work to spread the Mystic Law, in those very actions, we “exhaust the pains and trials of millions of kalpas” in each moment. That is, we concentrate millions of eons’ worth of arduous effort in a single moment. Ultimately, this teaches that we must win decisively right now.

I can grab onto this perspective! It’s a huge point. “Winning decisively right now” means tacking into the winds to advance, taking advantage of openings and opportunities. It is a silly example, but Guy and I took turns streaking into the unclothed crowd led by Dee and Eulogio on Sunday, and whatever barriers that had persisted just melted away. We were not over-entitled “The Owners” but just four naked people without pretenses among friends.

Dr. Ikeda quotes the Daishonin, “The lion king … always exerts its full power in attack, regardless of the strength of its opponent” (WND-1, 1039). 

>Lion kings never hold back their strength, regardless of the opponent. It’s important, therefore, that we give our all, seizing each moment, chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, and continuing to make wholehearted efforts. Such diligent practice is what “exerting ourselves bravely and vigorously” means and is the very essence of courage.

May I--and my millions of readers--quickly forget and move beyond Bills Mafia psychology? On Friday night we have a leaders Zoom call to plan our Chapter Kick-off Meeting on January 31st. Our discussion meeting is Sunday, January 18th. There’s a lot for our band of WNY lion kings to accomplish in just a few days!

I have learned that it’s never the SGI event itself—it’s always about my human revolution that precedes it. With my dissociative disorder, can I ground myself to feel worthy of victory? Can I lower the iron-clad walls I have created to protect my perceived self to fully engage in each moment? Can I duck those passing darts of rigid consciousness and breathe in the moment?

What happens as I make progress? Dr. Ikeda states:

>By “exerting ourselves bravely and vigorously,” we activate the “three Buddha bodies with which we are eternally endowed” (OTT, 214)—that is, the Buddha’s compassion and wisdom come flowing forth like a wellspring from within, and we find the true strength innate in our lives.

No wonder why I feel so great after each discussion meeting! It takes a full month to prepare for a meeting. The event itself passes like a fleeting moment but the faucet of compassion and wisdom has opened!

Said he had something he wanted to talk about. I figured it was something going on in his life so I agreed.

We sat down and chatted for a bit about normal stuff. Then he got all serious and started telling me he doesnt understand why Im with my boyfriend when hes right there. He went on about how he liked me first and hes known me longer and hes better looking and makes more money and all this stuff.

He literally said he doesnt get how I could choose someone else when hes been waiting around for me this whole time. Like I was supposed to just know he was interested and pick him by default.

I asked him if he wanted me to be honest. He said yes.

So I told him. I said Ive watched how he treats women hes dated over the years and I would never want to be one of them. He disappears on people whenever he feels like it then expects them to still be there when he comes back. Hes flaky and immature and honestly exhausting to even be friends with sometimes. I told him thats actually why Ive been pulling back from the friendship lately because I dont like the person hes become.

.
Later that night I started getting texts from our mutual friends asking what I did to him. Apparently hes been drinking and moping and telling everyone I destroyed him. 

But he literally asked me to be honest. And someone needed to tell him the truth because clearly no one else has. I didnt say anything that wasnt true.

**EN:**

At Platform 7, the winter hat decided to think in triangles. The smartphone whispered in cyan, the tablet responded in emerald—a conversation about nothing that took seventeen minutes and cost two dimensions.

The figure between them had dissolved into angles. Not broken, understand—*dissolved*. Like sugar in coffee, but backwards: the coffee became the sugar, and the figure became the waiting itself.

Red insisted it was Tuesday. Purple claimed it was a place. Yellow kept interrupting with memories of warmth, but Blue corrected each one, folding them into rectangles that couldn’t exist until the train arrived.

The devices weren’t tools anymore. They were windows where the outside had crawled in and the inside had politely excused itself. The hat held everything together—winter’s last argument against geometry, a soft circle in a world of sharp decisions.

When the S-Bahn finally came, it was made of the same colors as the waiting. Nobody boarded. The platform became the destination. The devices went quiet, having said everything that couldn’t be said.

The figure remained, now fully angular, perfectly patient, teaching the cold how to be colorful.

**DE:**

Auf Gleis 7 beschloss die Wintermütze, in Dreiecken zu denken. Das Smartphone flüsterte in Cyan, das Tablet antwortete in Smaragd—ein Gespräch über nichts, das siebzehn Minuten dauerte und zwei Dimensionen kostete.

Die Figur zwischen ihnen hatte sich in Winkel aufgelöst. Nicht zerbrochen, versteh—*aufgelöst*. Wie Zucker im Kaffee, aber rückwärts: Der Kaffee wurde zum Zucker, und die Figur wurde zum Warten selbst.

Rot behauptete, es sei Dienstag. Lila behauptete, es sei ein Ort. Gelb unterbrach ständig mit Erinnerungen an Wärme, aber Blau korrigierte jede einzelne und faltete sie zu Rechtecken, die nicht existieren konnten, bis die Bahn kam.

Die Geräte waren keine Werkzeuge mehr. Sie waren Fenster, durch die das Draußen hereingekrochen war und das Drinnen sich höflich verabschiedet hatte. Die Mütze hielt alles zusammen—Winters letztes Argument gegen Geometrie, ein weicher Kreis in einer Welt scharfer Entscheidungen.

Als die S-Bahn endlich kam, bestand sie aus denselben Farben wie das Warten. Niemand stieg ein. Der Bahnsteig wurde zum Ziel. Die Geräte verstummten, nachdem sie alles gesagt hatten, was nicht gesagt werden konnte.

Die Figur blieb, nun vollständig eckig, perfekt geduldig, und lehrte die Kälte, wie man farbenfroh wird.

I (21M) have been chatting with this girl (20F) on Discord for a couple months now and we have been really flirty, sent each other sexually explicit images and now we both want to hookup. 

We have facetimed plenty of times, so I am very sure I am not getting catfished. I am really excited but the only downside is that I live in Eastern Pennsylvania and she lives in Central Pennsylvania and it's a 3 hour drive one way (6 hour drive total) 

So, do I make the long drive there or not?

Figured I’d update since a few people asked. I ended up making the full three hour drive and honestly, I don’t regret it. Don't worry, I'm not dead and was definitely not catfished 😂. In fact, she looked even better in person.

We clicked just like we did online, had sex a couple of times, and at first it was awkward but we became comfortable quickly.

This morning we grabbed coffee and just hung out. It was freezing, so she drove me around her town and showed me a few spots, which was actually really nice and low-key.

I’m planning to head back tomorrow. This definitely doesn’t feel like a one-time thing. Going forward we’ll probably meet halfway, which will be more convenient. Overall, I’m glad I went for it. Sometimes the drive is worth it lol.

Hi all,

I am 25F and I have never been to Bangalore. I have heard so much about the city and really want to visit it sometime in March end/April start this year.

I am a WFH employee so I’ll be working during the weekdays and maybe go out in the mornings or evenings. 

But I have a couple of questions:

1. Which area should I stay in? I am interested in working from cafes, going to malls and maybe visiting a brewery at night (not every night just once or twice) 

2. I know there aren’t many touristy places to go but I am interested in blr palace and iskon temple. Any other reccs? I am solo so let me know if going to the blr palace alone is a good idea? 

3. What are some other experiences/things I shouldn’t miss?

4. Also, please give me your best eating spots!! I am interested in the south indian food, the yumm coffees and more.

5. Itinerary ideas? As I said, I will be working so I need to keep the itinerary very chill.

My partner might join me for the last 3 days of the trip but for the rest 4 I am on my own. 

Very excited for my trip, please drop your comments.🫶

It was never where beginnings burn bright, nor where endings have already sealed our fate. It lived in the restricted section, where honesty revealed itself, and loneliness drifted through like an undesired façade. That’s where you and I established residence. My love for you was never about the way you touched me, although it felt like a confession whispered too close and neither of us pulled away. My love came from the way you looked at me when you let me see what you’re afraid to become. In those small, unguarded seconds, you weren’t trying to be anyone else. Those rare moments when the masks fell away you were just a man standing before another human being, yearning to be seen. You always seemed to despise those moments. You’d joke, or reach for a bottle, another line, or grab your phone like a lifeline back into oblivion. Anything to keep you from lingering in the place where your heart was visible. But I stayed there. I stayed in those pauses. In the almost-confessions. In the way you said my name, almost like it carried a truth you didn’t feel safe enough to admit. Sometimes you held me like you were afraid of losing me, other times you held me like you already had. That was the hardest part, never knowing which version of you was going to show up. The one who whispered plans about a future or the one who vanished the instant things felt too real. You were always running, but never away from me. You were running from yourself. And somehow I became the place you always circled back to whenever the noise got too loud for you. I was where you went to remember that you still have a heart. And you were where I went when I needed reminding that real connections still exist. That’s what made it so perilous. Loving you felt like standing on the edge of something beautiful and unfinished, like watching a sunrise through shattered glass while hoping the warmth would stay. I wanted the life we used to talk about, the life that felt like home: morning light, shared coffee, and a future that didn’t hold its breath. But you live in a world made of almosts: almost sober, almost ready, and almost brave enough to choose something that endures. I kept waiting for you to bridge the gap between us. Until the almost revealed what it could not become. I don’t think you ever meant to hurt me. I think you just didn’t know how to stay.

If you’ve ever gone to an anime convention and thought, “Wow, I forgot to eat today,” congratulations—you’re already spiritually prepared for [AniMinneapolis](https://animinneapolis.com/about). Now let’s make sure you’re physically prepared, too.

AniMinneapolis runs **May 8–10, 2026 at the Hyatt Regency Minneapolis**, and it’s a full three-day marathon of cosplay, concerts, panels, gaming, shopping, and social chaos (the good kind). Over **5,000+ attendees**, hundreds of events, late nights, early mornings, and enough stimulation to make your brain feel like it’s buffering. This is not the weekend to “wing it” with food and hydration. This is the weekend to be strategic.

Because here’s the truth nobody likes to admit: your convention experience lives and dies by whether you ate something that wasn’t candy and whether you drank actual water instead of just caffeine and vibes.

Let’s talk survival.

**First Rule of AniMinneapolis: You Need Fuel (Yes, Even If You’re “Too Busy”)**

AniMinneapolis is packed. The [Exhibit Hall](https://animinneapolis.com/dealers) alone can eat up hours as you browse anime merch, handcrafted goods, plushies, prints, cosplay accessories, and “I didn’t know I needed this but now I do” purchases. Add in *cosplay contests, stage shows, concerts, autographs, panels, karaoke, videogaming, tabletop gaming, meetups, photoshoots,* and suddenly it’s 7 p.m. and you realize the last thing you ate was… vibes.

This is where ConSweet becomes your best friend.

**ConSweet: The MVP of Your Weekend**

AniMinneapolis’ [ConSweet](https://animinneapolis.com/consweet) is included with your badge, and honestly, it’s one of the most underrated survival perks of the con. We’re talking **free ramen, rice, soda, and snacks**, available throughout the weekend (supplies are limited, so timing matters). It’s not fancy, but it is reliable, warm, salty, and life-restoring.

ConSweet is perfect for:

* A quick meal before a long panel block
* Refueling between cosplay photoshoots
* Rehydrating after dancing your soul out at the **Friday & Saturday Epic Dances**
* Sitting down for five blessed minutes when your feet file a formal complaint

Pro tip: Don’t wait until you’re starving. If you pass ConSweet and think, *“I could eat,”* go eat. Convention hunger escalates fast and irrationally.

**Hydration: The Thing Everyone Forgets Until It’s a Problem**

Let’s be direct: dehydration will ruin your con faster than bad Wi-Fi.

Between crowded halls, dancing, singing at **Karaoke Krypt**, and wearing cosplay that may or may not breathe, you’re losing water constantly. Add caffeine into the mix and suddenly you’re dizzy, cranky, and questioning your life choices.

Carry a refillable water bottle. The Hyatt Regency Minneapolis makes this easier than most hotels, and having water on you during panels, stage shows, and long autograph lines is non-negotiable.

If you start feeling:

* Headachey
* Weirdly tired
* Foggy
* Irritable for no reason

That’s not “con vibes.” That’s dehydration.

Drink water. Then drink more water. Then maybe drink water again.

**Caffeine Is Not a Meal (I Know, I’m Sorry)**

Yes, coffee is convenient. Yes, energy drinks are tempting. No, surviving on caffeine alone is not a personality trait—it’s a mistake.

Caffeine without food leads to jitters, crashes, and the kind of anxiety spiral where you convince yourself everyone hates you and your cosplay is falling apart (even when it’s fine).

Balance it out. Eat before long panels. Eat before concerts. Eat before the Epic Dances. A protein bar before a late-night event will do more for you than your third energy drink ever could.

**Smart Snacking: Pack Like a Veteran**

Even with ConSweet and nearby food options, packing snacks is elite-level con behavior.

Bring things that:

* Don’t melt
* Don’t crumble into dust
* Don’t require refrigeration

Protein bars, trail mix, jerky, crackers, nuts—these are your quiet heroes. Toss a couple into your bag and thank yourself later when you’re stuck watching an amazing **stage show** and don’t want to leave to hunt food.

Eating small, steady snacks keeps your energy up and prevents the “I forgot to eat and now I’m feral” phase.

**Balancing Food With the Schedule (Because AniMinneapolis Is Busy)**

AniMinneapolis doesn’t do “slow weekends.” Between **cosplay contests**, **autograph sessions**, **fan-run panels**, **game demos**, **concerts**, and the always-tempting **videogaming lounge**, your schedule fills fast.

The trick is eating *around* the schedule, not as an afterthought.

Eat before:

* Long panels or panel blocks
* The Grand Cosplay Competition
* Concerts and stage shows
* The Cosplay Prom / Fantasy Ball

Especially the **Fantasy Ball**. Dancing in cosplay on an empty stomach is a bold choice, and not a good one.

**Events That Burn Calories (Yes, It Counts)**

Some AniMinneapolis events are sneakily exhausting, and you should plan food accordingly.

The **Friday & Saturday Epic Dances** are high-energy EDM nights featuring genres like Jumpstyle, Hardstyle, Techno, Trance, House, and Drum and Bass. You will sweat. You will burn energy. You will need water afterward.

**Karaoke Krypt** is another sleeper hit for energy drain. Singing anime themes at full volume feels amazing, but it also dries your throat fast. Hydrate before and after.

**Cosplay photoshoots** involve more walking and standing than you think. Same with wandering the **Exhibit Hall** multiple times “just to look.”

Fuel accordingly.

**Maid Cafe: Snack With Style**

The **Maid Cafe** is a fun, interactive experience inspired by Japanese maid cafes, adapted for the convention setting. Snacks are included, and tickets are purchased at the con.

It’s playful, energetic, and a nice break from the constant walking. Consider it both entertainment *and* sustenance—a two-for-one deal.

**Meetups, Autographs, and Social Energy**

Meetups are where AniMinneapolis really shines as a community-focused con. Whether you’re into specific fandoms, fashion styles, or niche interests, meetups are where friendships form fast.

Autograph sessions with guests—some of which are free—can involve waiting. Eat beforehand. Hydrate. You’ll enjoy the experience way more if you’re not distracted by hunger.

**Gaming Rooms and Energy Management**

The **Tabletop Gaming Room**, **game demos**, [arcade room](https://animinneapolis.com/arcade), and **videogaming lounge** are easy places to lose track of time. Hours disappear fast when you’re playing board games, trying new releases, or battling friends in tournaments.

Keep snacks nearby. Take water breaks. Stretch occasionally. Your future self will thank you.

**Tickets, Timing, and Why Early Registration Helps Your Sanity**

Tickets start at **$45 for a full weekend**, with **Sunday passes at $25** and **Platinum/VIP badges at $110**. Early registration means faster check-in, guaranteed access, and helps the con bring in more guests.

Less time in lines means more time eating, hydrating, and actually enjoying the weekend.

**Final Survival Wisdom (From Someone Who’s Learned the Hard Way)**

Eat before you’re hungry. Drink water before you’re thirsty. Pack snacks like you know future-you will forget. Don’t rely solely on caffeine. Sit down when you can. Use ConSweet. Respect your body.

AniMinneapolis is a blast—three days of anime, gaming, music, creativity, and community at the [Hyatt Regency Minneapolis](https://animinneapolis.com/location)**, May 8–10, 2026**. You want to remember it for the amazing experiences, not because you survived it on soda and hope.

Do it for yourself!,"I {42/F}have been with my guy {48/M} coming up on 7 years in May. We were both previously married, mine ending in a dissolution and he is a widower. He has 4 kids and I have 1, they are all adults.

I will start with the reason I came here today and that is to say DO NOT let a relationship take advantage of you. Make yourself a PRIORITY! DO NOT SETTLE! I know the older we get it is easy to just want to settle so we are not alone, but it is easier, at least for me, to be alone than resentful and unhappy in a relationship and here is why...

In our relationship (all really) I have definitely been the giver, I suppose because it is just in my nature and my love language: gifts, acts of service, words of affirmation, all of it. He, on the other doesn't really do any of that...honestly.

Throughout the course of our relationship I have given, given, given. Staying at his house a lot, helping with the chores, cooking (with him not helping or helping to clean up), setting his coffee, making his lunch, grocery shopping, helping him with phone calls, appointments, planning trips and paying for them, throwing parties for him and the kids, etc. I helped him with so many tech things, setting up his wifi, tending to accounts, because he doesn't like computers. Honestly, resentment had been building up and I started pulling away. Talking to him about all of this would lead to arguments and he would yell, tell me to go home, that no one asked me to do those things. So I went back to my place.

What I had realized through all of the years is that I was doing all of the ""wifey"" things with girlfriend status. I know that is a popular phrase lately, but it is so true! He once said he would marry me but when I brought it up recently he said no. What a blow that was because he knows I wanted that again.

We are still technically together but are taking time apart to maybe recalibrate things. I realized that I didn't make myself a priority in this relationship and in other relationships in my life and I have disappointed myself. I pulled away from family and friends to make him a priority and I felt that the more I did for him the more he would try, but that doesn't work.

My previous marriage ended pretty much for the same reason and my ex husband and I grew apart, but he later realized that he should have done and been there more for me. He and I are friends but don't hang out, civil towards one another.

My partner and I (27-34) are travelling to Thailand for the first time in a few weeks. Our whole time there is about 20 days. First part is spent between Chiang Mai and Bangkok, remaining week we would like to spend in the south. Do you have any recommendations for us, or any places that you absolutely loved and think we should visit?

Things we like: wild nature, hikes, vegan food, meeting people, culture, meditation and yoga, temples, a feeling of authenticity, specialty coffee, traditional or contemporary art, slightly hip places, responsible tourism. 

Turn offs: wishy washy spirituality, checklists of monuments or must-see places, loud tourists, influencers, bros, overly touristy or developed places, big shopping malls. 

We don’t dive or surf (though we would like some relax beach time) and nightlife would be something curious to explore but isn’t necessary (we are based in Berlin so the standard is high - avoid full moon party and commercial music)

Do you have any recommendations for us? Or places that we should avoid? Curious to hear about your experiences, especially about some off-the-beaten-track places.

But at Superthread, we’ve been obsessing over the most invisible, yet most expensive feature of all, Speed.

**The true cost of a 3-second delay**

It seems insignificant, but if your current PM tool takes just 3 seconds to load a new screen or open a ticket, and a typical Product Manager or Engineer performs roughly 50 of these interactions a day, well...

* 3 seconds x 50 interactions = 2.5 minutes lost per day.
* That’s \~12.5 minutes per week.
* Over a working year, that compounds to roughly 40 hours (one full work week) of staring at loading spinners.

When you click something and have to wait 3 seconds for a response, your brain doesn't just pause; it disengages. The flow is broken.

**The Gamer's Paradox**

Picture this: You’re at home playing a competitive online game, Valorant, CoD, LoL, whatever your go-to is. Your ping spikes to 300ms. Your character stutters. You miss the shot.

What happens? You are raging. It’s a disgrace in 2025 that this can happen with your 1GB internet speed. You rage-quit the session and stop playing altogether. But we don't have that same reaction or expectation for our work tools...

Now, picture Monday morning. You log into your ""Enterprise-Grade"" project management suite. You click to open the backlog for the upcoming sprint.

*Loading...* *Spinner spins...* *Still loading...*

It takes four seconds. Do you rage quit? 

No. You sigh, take a sip of coffee, and patiently wait. We have been conditioned to accept sluggish, bloated performance as a necessary evil of ""serious work software.""

**Don't settle for lag just because it's ""Work""**

Why should the tools we spend 8 hours a day in feel worse than the free apps on our phones?

If Google took 4 seconds to load search results, you’d use Bing. Speed isn't just a nice-to-have anymore. Speed is the baseline requirement for high-performance teams.

We are building Superthread for the people who haven't lost that impatience. We believe your PM tool should be as snappy as a local text editor.

1qbofrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1qbofrl/the_night_we_opened_the_door/,The Night We Opened the Door.,"There is a certain kind of quiet you only hear in the desert.

It is not the peaceful kind people post about, not the wide-open silence that makes you feel small in a romantic way. It is the kind of quiet that feels like the world has stepped back a few feet and is watching you. Like the empty space around your house has weight.

My parents’ place sits on the edge of Las Vegas, where the neighborhoods thin out and the streetlights start to feel too far apart. In the day, everything looks sun-bleached and normal. Stucco homes. Gravel yards with neat little succulents. A few palm trees that look like they’re fighting the climate. The horizon is always too clear, the sky always too big.

At night, though, the desert makes the dark feel more intentional.

That weekend, it was supposed to be perfect.

We’d been looking forward to it for weeks, the three of us texting in our group chat like it was a countdown to something sacred. Carmen Lopez had brought two duffel bags, one full of clothes and one full of snacks, because she said she didn’t trust anyone else to pack correctly. Shay Smith had a portable speaker and a stack of horror movies she insisted were “classic,” even though I’d never heard of half of them. And me, Alyssa Short, I had the house.

A whole house.

Just for us.

My parents called it an “Adult Weekend” with that specific tone adults use when they want you to know they’re still cool. My mom had actually said the word casinos like she was saying it for my benefit, like I was supposed to picture them dressed up and happy and out late. They were going with Carmen’s parents and Shay’s parents too. Three couples. A weekend getaway. Dinner reservations. Shows. Slot machines. They made it sound like a group field trip.

They kept telling us all the same thing.

“Don’t open the door for anyone.”

“Don’t leave the backyard gate unlatched.”

“Keep your phones on.”

“Order food, but don’t tell anyone you’re alone.”

My dad said that last one like it was a joke. Like it was a funny little modern rule.

But he said it twice.

By the time their cars pulled away Friday afternoon, the three of us were already on the living room floor with blankets and nail polish and the kind of laughter that makes your stomach hurt.

It felt like freedom in the most teenage way possible. Not dramatic. Not rebellious. Just finally, for once, not being watched.

We made TikToks we never posted. We did face masks that made us look like aliens. Carmen tried to teach Shay and me a dance she swore was easy, and we all almost fell into the coffee table.

Then it was night, and the air-conditioning made the house feel too cold, and the windows turned into black mirrors reflecting our faces back at us.

Shay wanted to watch something scary, because of course she did. She said horror movies were “comforting,” which was the craziest thing I’d ever heard. Carmen argued for a rom-com. I said we could do both, because I didn’t want to fight on our weekend.

We ended up with Shay’s choice first.

The movie was the kind that used silence like a weapon. Long shots of empty hallways. A soundtrack that sounded like distant breathing. The kind of film where every creak in the house feels like it could be part of the story.

Halfway through, Carmen got up and started rummaging in my kitchen cabinets like she owned the place.

“We need pizza,” she announced.

“Obviously,” I said.

My family has a tradition. It sounds silly when I say it out loud, but it’s real. Every weekend, at least once, we get Papa John’s. It started when I was little and my dad was working late all the time. Friday nights were pizza nights, no matter what. It didn’t matter if we were broke. It didn’t matter if we were busy. Papa John’s meant the week was done. It meant we were all in the same room.

So when Carmen said pizza, my brain didn’t even process the possibility of something else. Pizza was normal. Pizza was safe. Pizza was home.

Shay made a face. “I thought Italians hated chain pizza.”

“I’m Italian,” I said, pointing at myself like it was evidence. “And I love it. It’s a family tradition.”

Carmen grinned. “See? Cultural significance.”

We checked the fridge. Nothing that wasn’t a condiment or something my mom would use in a salad. Carmen waved her phone around like she was searching for signal even though the Wi-Fi was fine.

“My mom said they might order us food,” she said. “Like surprise us.”

“My dad said the same,” Shay added.

That settled it in our minds. The idea became a fact. Parents out at casinos, feeling generous, sending pizza to their daughters like a sitcom.

We went back to the living room and waited, half-watching the movie, half-watching our phones, the way you do when you’re expecting something you really want.

At some point, I must have gotten too comfortable. I remember the blankets around my legs, the glow of the TV, Shay’s braids falling forward as she leaned toward the screen. Carmen’s laugh was soft as she whispered a comment about how the main character was making dumb choices.

Then, the knock.

It didn’t sound like it belonged in the movie.

It came from the front door, sharp and real, and it cut through the room in a way that made all three of us freeze.

We looked at each other.

“Pizza,” Carmen mouthed, like she was afraid to say it too loudly.

Shay lowered the volume. The TV became a muted flicker.

Another knock came, a little impatient this time.

We all moved at once, the three of us sliding off the couch like we’d rehearsed it. The living room opened into the entryway, and beyond that was the front door, painted a pale tan that blended into the stucco outside. There was a peephole. There were two locks. There was a small Ring camera my dad had installed after our neighbor’s car got broken into.

We didn’t think about any of that.

We thought about pizza.

Carmen leaned in and peered through the peephole.

“Yep,” she whispered. “Delivery guy.”

Shay pushed closer. “Is he holding it?”

“Yeah. Box bag thing.”

My stomach actually fluttered with happiness. It’s embarrassing how much joy a pizza can bring when you’re sixteen and the night feels wide open.

I stepped up and slid the inside light on, because I wanted whoever it was to know we were there, to know we were coming. Then I unlocked the top lock.

Carmen’s hand touched my arm. “Wait, should we ask who ordered it?”

“It’s fine,” I said, because I genuinely believed that. “It’s Papa John’s. It’s probably my parents.”

Shay was already smiling. “If your parents got garlic knots, I’ll forgive them for leaving us.”

I opened the door.

At first, it was exactly what we expected.

A man in a delivery uniform stood on the porch. He had a cap pulled low and a thermal bag in his left hand. The porch light made his face look pale and washed out. He wasn’t old, maybe late twenties or early thirties, but there was something about his stillness that made him seem older. He wasn’t shifting his weight like people usually do. He wasn’t smiling. His eyes flicked past me, past the doorway, into the house like he was counting shapes.

“Evening,” I said, bright and automatic.

He didn’t respond to that. Instead, he tilted his head slightly and asked, in a tone that was wrong in a way I can’t fully explain, “Are you three girls alone in here?”

It was the exact moment the air changed.

The question wasn’t normal. It wasn’t part of any delivery script. It didn’t match the pizza in his hand.

Behind me, Shay went very still. Carmen’s fingers tightened on my arm.

I should have lied.

I know that now. I know it in the way you know you should have grabbed the handrail before you fell. But in the moment, my brain was still running on the assumption that everything made sense.

And Carmen, on instinct, because Carmen always answered things quickly, said, “Yeah. Our parents are at the casino for the weekend.”

The delivery driver’s expression changed immediately.

It wasn’t dramatic. He didn’t grin or laugh. It was subtler than that, which made it worse. His eyes sharpened, like something had clicked into place.

Then he moved.

Fast.

Before I could even step back, he shoved the thermal bag into my chest hard enough to knock the air out of me. My feet slid on the tile. The edge of the door slammed against the wall. He came in with the momentum of someone who’d already decided.

Carmen screamed.

Shay’s hands flew up.

I tried to push him back out, but he was already inside the threshold, already in our space. His shoulder hit mine. His breath smelled like cigarettes and something sour.

“Back,” he said, and it wasn’t loud, but it was sharp. Commanding. “Back up.”

His right hand came out from behind his body holding a knife.

Not a little pocket knife. Not a tool. A kitchen knife with a long blade that caught the porch light and turned it into a thin, bright line.

My entire body locked.

It felt unreal. Like a prop. Like something from the movie still playing silently in my living room.

But Shay made a sound, a low choked noise that told me she understood exactly how real it was.

“Please,” Carmen said immediately, her voice shaking. “Please, take whatever you want. Just, just leave.”

He didn’t look at Carmen.

He looked at me.

Maybe because I was closest. Maybe because it was my house. Maybe because I was standing there with a pizza bag pressed to my chest like I’d been handed a bomb.

“Inside,” he said. “All of you. Move.”

Shay’s eyes met mine. I saw the same thought in them, the same desperate attempt to find an exit, a weapon, an adult, a miracle.

But the house was suddenly a trap. The door behind him. The windows that were too high. The silence outside.

We moved, because the knife made our bodies obey.

He herded us through the entryway into the living room, pushing the door closed with his foot behind him. The click of it shutting sounded too final, like a lock clicking in a prison.

The movie on the TV kept flashing. A character’s face frozen mid-scream in a silent world.

The delivery driver, because I still thought of him that way even as everything shattered, pointed the knife toward the hallway.

“Bedroom,” he said.

Carmen shook her head, crying. “Please, please don’t.”

“Bedroom,” he repeated, louder. “Now.”

We went down the hallway like it was a tunnel narrowing around us. My heart was pounding so hard it made my vision pulse. I could hear Shay breathing in short, sharp bursts. Carmen was sobbing openly, her hands held up as if that could shield her.

The man followed close, the knife angled forward, and I realized, with a cold, horrifying clarity, that he wasn’t improvising. He wasn’t uncertain. He knew where he wanted us.

He pushed us into my parents’ guest bedroom, the one with the beige comforter and the framed desert print on the wall. The room smelled faintly like laundry detergent and unused space.

“On the floor,” he said.

We got down.

The carpet pressed into my knees. The air felt too thick.

He reached into his hoodie and pulled out zip ties.

My stomach dropped again. This wasn’t random.

This wasn’t a guy who snapped at the door.

He had come prepared.

He tied our wrists, tight enough to hurt but not tight enough to cut off circulation, and he did it with a grim efficiency that made my skin crawl. Shay struggled, once, instinctively jerking away, and he raised the knife close to her face in a warning that made her freeze.

“Stop,” he hissed.

He tied our ankles too, then backed toward the door, still holding the knife, eyes darting from face to face like he was watching for movement.

“You scream,” he said, voice low, “and I come back in.”

Then he stepped out and shut the door.

We heard the lock click.

For a second, none of us moved. Not because we didn’t want to. Because our brains couldn’t accept the fact that we were locked inside a bedroom in my own house, tied up, while a stranger with a knife walked freely in the rest of our lives.

Carmen was the first to break. She started shaking violently, tears sliding down her face into the carpet.

Shay leaned toward her as far as she could with her wrists bound. “Carmen. Carmen, look at me. We have to stay quiet.”

Her voice was steady in that way that didn’t match what was happening. It made me want to cry harder. Shay was always the calm one, the one who could talk to teachers without panicking, the one who could stop a fight just by looking at someone.

But this was bigger than us.

I tried to move my wrists. The zip ties bit into my skin. The pain helped keep me grounded.

“What do we do?” I whispered.

Shay’s eyes were wide, shining. “We wait. We listen. We don’t make noise.”

Carmen shook her head, whispering frantically. “He asked if we were alone. He asked. That’s not normal. That’s not, that’s not—”

“I know,” Shay said.

The house beyond the door creaked.

We heard footsteps. Slow. Wandering. Like he was exploring.

Then a drawer opening. A cabinet door. Something clinking.

He was going through our kitchen. Our living room. Our things.

The worst part was the uncertainty. The not knowing where he was. What he was doing. Whether he was bored, whether he was angry, whether he was planning something.

Time stretched. My legs went numb. My hands ached. Carmen’s breathing came in little squeaky bursts as she tried not to sob too loud.

Then we heard him talking.

At first, I thought he was on the phone. But the voice was too close. Too loud.

He was talking to himself.

Words drifting down the hallway, not coherent, fragments and muttering like a radio between stations. It made my scalp prickle. It made the situation feel less like a robbery and more like something unpredictable, something that could change shape without warning.

“Stupid,” he muttered at one point. “Stupid girls. Stupid.”

Carmen squeezed her eyes shut. Shay stared at the door like she could force it to open with her mind.

I kept thinking about the Ring camera, about how my dad would see him. Then I remembered the angle. The porch. The front door. It wouldn’t see him inside. It would see the moment we opened the door, then nothing.

And we’d opened it.

We’d invited the dark in like it was carrying dinner.

I don’t know how long we were in that room. Maybe twenty minutes. Maybe an hour. It felt like a night compressed into a tight space.

Then my phone buzzed.

The sound was tiny, almost nothing, but it was loud in a room where we were all holding our breath.

It was in my pocket.

My heart lurched. I couldn’t reach it with my hands tied.

It buzzed again. And again.

Carmen’s eyes snapped to me, panicked. Shay leaned in, whispering, “Don’t move. Don’t make it worse.”

The buzzing stopped.

A few minutes later, it started again.

This time, longer. Persistent.

My mom’s voice echoed in my head, Keep your phone on.

Dad’s voice, Don’t open the door.

I imagined my parents in a casino, lights flashing, noise everywhere, my mom checking her phone with a little smile like she was being responsible, like she was going to ask how our weekend was going.

I couldn’t answer.

The buzzing stopped.

Then, later, it buzzed again, three times, each one like a pulse.

The third call felt different. It lasted longer. It was insistent. And then it stopped abruptly, as if someone had made a decision.

Outside the bedroom, footsteps moved fast.

The man’s voice rose, angry now, yelling at no one, words slamming into the walls. Then the house went quiet, suddenly, as if he’d realized something.

I stared at the door.

Shay’s voice was barely audible. “My mom would call if I didn’t answer.”

Carmen whispered, “My dad too.”

And then, like a confirmation of our fear, the sound of a phone rang somewhere in the house.

Not mine. Not in the bedroom.

The intruder answered it.

We couldn’t hear the words clearly, but we heard the rhythm. Someone trying to sound normal. Someone trying to imitate.

“Hello?” he said, too cheerful, too quick. Then he paused. “Yeah. Yeah, we’re fine.”

My blood went cold.

He was pretending.

He was pretending to be my dad.

Because the voice was lower now, forced, and he was speaking like an adult on the phone, not like a pizza driver.

I heard my father in my mind, calm and careful, and I heard this stranger trying to wear that voice like a mask.

Then there was silence. Then the man laughed, a short, sharp sound, and hung up.

We sat there, tied up, listening to the house, and the terror shifted shape. It wasn’t just the knife anymore. It was the understanding that he was willing to interact with the world outside, that he could mislead people, that he could buy time.

Then, distant, faint, almost impossible to hear through walls and fear, came a sound that made my eyes fill with tears.

Sirens.

Not the movie. Not the soundtrack.

Real.

Approaching.

Shay closed her eyes and exhaled, one long breath like she’d been holding it for hours. Carmen let out a sound that was half sob, half prayer.

The sirens grew louder, then cut off abruptly, as if the police car had stopped just outside.

The house went still.

Footsteps moved again, quick and purposeful, toward the front door.

We heard the chain slide. The lock. The door opening.

Then a voice.

A man’s voice. Firm. Controlled.

“Sir,” he said, and it echoed faintly down the hallway. “We received a call from this residence. Can you step outside for me?”

The intruder’s voice changed again, deepening, smoothing, trying to become my father.

“There’s no problem,” he said. “I’m the homeowner. Everything’s fine.”

The officer didn’t sound convinced.

“Okay,” the officer said slowly. “Can I see your ID, sir?”

A pause.

A long pause where the house seemed to hold its breath with us.

“I, uh,” the intruder said, and for the first time he sounded unsure. “It’s inside.”

“Then let’s get it,” the officer said, still calm, still firm.

Another pause.

Then, sharper, “I don’t need to show you anything. I told you, I’m the homeowner.”

The officer’s voice hardened slightly. “Sir, the caller is still on the line with dispatch. They are saying you are not the homeowner.”

My stomach flipped.

Dispatch. My dad. The call. He’d called 911.

And the officer knew.

The intruder’s voice turned brittle. “This is ridiculous.”

The officer said, “I’m going to ask you one more time. Show me your ID.”

We heard a shuffle, like someone moving on the porch. Then another voice, a second officer, quieter, saying something we couldn’t make out.

Then the first officer spoke again, louder. “Sir, step back. Keep your hands where I can see them.”

My heartbeat pounded in my ears.

In the bedroom, Shay shifted, trying to rub her wrists against the carpet. Carmen stared at me like her eyes could ask a question she didn’t have words for.

Then we heard it.

A sudden thud, like a body hitting the door frame.

A scuffle. A curse.

The officer shouted something, and then the sound of the front door slammed.

Footsteps pounded inside the house, not wandering now, but running.

The intruder was moving deeper in, away from the porch, away from the police.

Toward us.

Shay’s eyes went wide, her face draining of color.

Carmen began to whimper.

I tried to scoot backward, dragging my bound legs uselessly, until my shoulder hit the bed frame. The wood felt solid and cruel behind me.

The doorknob rattled.

Once.

Twice.

Then the lock clicked, and the door opened a fraction before stopping, caught by something, maybe the officer pushing from the other side, maybe the intruder trying to force it.

A voice filled the hallway, close now, commanding.

“Police,” the officer shouted. “Step away from the door. Step away now.”

The door jerked, then slammed shut again.

Silence.

Then the officer’s footsteps moved fast down the hall, closer, and a key turned in the lock.

The door flew open.

An officer stood there, gun raised, eyes scanning the room, his face taut with concentration and adrenaline. Behind him, another officer, slightly farther back, covering the hallway.

For a second, they looked at us like they couldn’t process the sight. Three girls on the floor, wrists bound, ankles bound, faces streaked with tears.

Then the first officer swore under his breath and rushed in.

“It’s okay,” he said, voice softer now, urgent. “You’re okay. We’ve got you.”

He knelt and began cutting the zip ties with something small and sharp. The plastic snapped. Blood rushed back into my hands in hot, painful tingles.

Shay’s breath came out in a sob she’d been holding in the whole time. Carmen started crying so hard she shook.

“Where is he?” the officer asked, scanning the room again as he freed us. “Did he come in here? Did he leave?”

I tried to speak, but my throat felt sealed.

The officer’s radio crackled. Voices layered over each other, urgent updates about the front of the house, about the backyard, about a suspect moving through side yards, about a vehicle.

A vehicle.

The unknown car.

My dad had seen it. That was what made him call. That was what saved us.

My legs finally freed, I pushed myself upright, dizzy, my knees weak. The officer helped me stand like I was much older than sixteen, like I might collapse into dust.

“Your parents are on the way,” he said. “Stay with us.”

But even as he said it, my eyes drifted past him to the hallway, to the shadows beyond, to the rest of my house, suddenly unfamiliar. Every open doorway looked like a mouth. Every room looked like it could be hiding something.

My brain kept replaying the moment at the door, the way we’d seen a uniform and a pizza bag and assumed it meant safety.

The officer led us out into the living room. The TV was still on, the horror movie still playing silently, characters moving in flickering dread while real life stood in the same space, heavier and colder.

The front door was open. Night air poured in, warm and dry.

Outside, red and blue lights strobed across the stucco walls, turning my yard into a pulsing, surreal scene. Neighbors had stepped out onto their porches, drawn by the commotion, faces lit by the police lights, eyes wide with that distant curiosity people get when danger happens near them but not to them.

I saw my dad’s car skid into the driveway a few minutes later, my parents spilling out like they’d been launched, my mom’s face white, her hands shaking. Carmen’s parents and Shay’s parents arrived too, all of them frantic, voices overlapping, adults suddenly small in the face of something they couldn’t control.

My dad grabbed me, crushing me to his chest so hard it hurt.

“I called,” he kept saying into my hair. “I saw the car. I saw the car. I called.”

My mom’s hands framed my face, checking me like she could fix what she was seeing. “Baby,” she whispered, voice breaking. “Oh my God.”

And all I could think was that I had opened the door.

I had opened it like it was a gift.

Later, after statements and blankets and water bottles we couldn’t drink because our hands shook too much, an officer came over and spoke quietly to my parents. I caught pieces of it. The suspect had fled on foot. They were searching the neighborhood. They had units out. They had a description. They had the vehicle.

I kept staring at the driveway, at the place where the unknown car had been parked earlier, the place my dad saw on the Ring camera.

The window that saved us.

I realized, sitting on the curb with my knees pulled up to my chest, that the most terrifying part wasn’t the knife, or even the bedroom lock.

It was how quickly our brains had filled in a story to make everything feel normal.

A knock.

A uniform.

A pizza bag.

And we had written the rest ourselves.

It made me wonder how many times a day we do that, not just with deliveries, but with everything. How often we assume a thing is safe because it looks like other safe things we’ve seen before.

How often we open doors.

When I finally went inside again, escorted by an officer, the house smelled like cold air and disturbed space. The guest bedroom carpet still showed the faint impressions where we’d been pressed into it. The zip ties, cut and discarded, lay like little broken loops of plastic on the floor.

On the kitchen counter, the pizza bag sat abandoned, the Papa John’s logo facing outward like a cruel joke.

The officer asked if we wanted it thrown away.

I nodded too quickly.

Because I could already see how it would feel in the future, how the sight of that logo would make my stomach turn, how garlic sauce would smell like fear.

I stood in my living room, staring at the front door, and my mind kept replaying the delivery driver’s question, the one that didn’t belong.

Are you three girls alone in here?

It wasn’t just a question. It was a test. A probe. A crack in the surface of the world.

And I realized something that made my chest tighten so hard I could barely breathe.

The scariest thing about that night wasn’t that something bad happened.

It was how easily it could have happened without warning, without reason, without any dramatic signal that we were about to cross a line.

Because nothing about it looked like danger, not until it already was.

And now, every time someone knocks on a door, every time I see a uniform, every time I smell pizza in a hallway, my mind does something it never did before.

It asks what else might be hiding behind what I think I see.

It listens to the quiet outside the house, the desert quiet, the watching quiet, and wonders how many people are out there depending on us to make the mistake first.

How many of them are holding something in one hand and a story in the other, waiting for us to believe the wrong one.",1,1768301986.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

Here is exactly what worked (and what didn't).,"I’d been unemployed for 9 months. If you’re in that boat, you know the struggle: savings draining, family worried, and the crushing feeling of shouting into the void.

I was sending about 20 ""Easy Apply on Linkedin"" a day. Results? Nothing to be honest. Maybe one automated rejection email if I was lucky.

I have a couple of friends who work in tech recruiting, so I invited them for coffee and literally printed out my resume. I asked them to roast it. No ego involved.

They told me that while my experience was good, my resume was invisible. I was writing for humans, but the first gatekeeper is a robot (ATS). They explained that if my resume doesn't mirror the job description’s keywords and phrasing exactly, I’m getting filtered out before they even see my name.

This are the most critical things they found: 

\-  I was using a sleek two column template from Canva. They told me the ATS parsers often scramble these layouts. If the robot can’t read it clearly, it gets tossed. ""Keep it boring to be safe,"" they said.

\- The job description asked for ""Client Relationship Management"" and I had ""Account Handling"". To a human, it's the same. To the ATS filter, it's not. They showed me how they use ""Ctrl+F"" or automated filters to find exact matches. I was being filtered out because I wasn't speaking the exact language of the JD.

\-My bullets were just lists of what I did (e.g., ""Managed a team""). They told me nobody cares about tasks. They care about results (e.g., ""Led a team of 5 to exceed quarterly targets by 15%"").

I realized I couldn't just have one resume. I needed a tailored resume for every single application.

I started using ChatGPT to rewrite my bullet points for every single job description. It was tedious as hell, but the results changed overnight.

\- Paste the Job Description (JD)

\- Paste my Resume.

\- Use a specific prompt to rewrite the bullet points based only on the keywords.

This is the actual Prompt I use (I have the free version of ChatGPT btw)

  
`Your task:`

`I will give you a job description and a resume.`

`You will tailor the resume to perfectly match the job description.`

`Rules:`

`Extract ALL relevant keywords from the job description:`

* `job title`
* `required skills`
* `preferred skills`
* `responsibilities`
* `tools/technologies`

`-soft skills`

* `domain keywords`
* `industry terms`

`For every required or relevant skill/keyword:`

* `If it already exists in the resume → rewrite & emphasize it`
* `If it exists but weak → strengthen, move higher, highlight impact`
* `If it's missing but the candidate has similar experience → add a truthful sentence`
* `If it’s not in the resume and can’t be assumed → DO NOT invent it`

`Reorganize the resume:`

* `Move the most relevant experience to the top`
* `Add a strong, tailored summary section at the beginning using job description keywords`
* `Strengthen achievements using measurable impact when possible`
* `Make responsibilities match the job description phrasing (without copying word-for-word)`

`Keep formatting clean and ATS friendly:`

* `No icons`
* `No tables`
* `No images`
* `Standard resume structure`

`Output should be:`

`A fully rewritten, ATS optimized, job-description matched resume.`

`Keep it concise, professional, and keyword rich`



It wasn't magic, and it wasn't instant. But after 3 weeks of doing this religiously:

* Sent \~30 highly tailored applications (stopped spamming).
* Received 6 screening calls.
* Landed 4 interviews.
* Accepted an offer last week.

The biggest lesson? The ""shotgun approach"" (applying to everything) doesn't work anymore. The ""sniper approach"" (tailoring everything) is annoying and slow, but it’s the only thing that moved the needle for me.

If you are struggling, try tailoring your resume heavily for just 5 jobs this week instead of easy applying to 50.

# A Perfect Balance of Crunch and Cream

1qbo826,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1qbo826/advice_about_making_yourself_a_priority_in/,Advice about making yourself a priority in relationships.,"Good morning everyone! I will start with the reason I came here today and that is to say DO NOT let a relationship take advantage of you. Make yourself a PRIORITY! DO NOT SETTLE! I know the older we get it is easy to just want to settle so we are not alone, but it is easier, at least for me, to be alone than resentful and unhappy in a relationship and here is why...

I have been with my guy coming up on 7 years in May. He just turned 48 and I am 42. We were both previously married, mine ending in a dissolution and he is a widower. He has 4 kids and I have 1, they are all adults.

In our relationship (all really) I have definitely been the giver, I suppose because it is just in my nature and my love language: gifts, acts of service, words of affirmation, all of it. He, on the other doesn't really do any of that...honestly.

Throughout the course of our relationship I have given, given, given. Staying at his house a lot, helping with the chores, cooking (with him not helping or helping to clean up), setting his coffee, making his lunch, grocery shopping, helping him with phone calls, appointments, planning trips and paying for them, throwing parties for him and the kids, etc. I helped him with so many tech things, setting up his wifi, tending to accounts, because he doesn't like computers. Honestly, resentment had been building up and I started pulling away. Talking to him about all of this would lead to arguments and he would yell, tell me to go home, that no one asked me to do those things. So I went back to my place.

What I had realized through all of the years is that I was doing all of the ""wifey"" things with girlfriend status. I know that is a popular phrase lately, but it is so true! He once said he would marry me but when I brought it up recently he said no. What a blow that was because he knows I wanted that again.

We are still technically together but are taking time apart to maybe recalibrate things. I realized that I didn't make myself a priority in this relationship and in other relationships in my life and I have disappointed myself. I pulled away from family and friends to make him a priority and I felt that the more I did for him the more he would try, but that doesn't work.

My previous marriage ended pretty much for the same reason and my ex husband and I grew apart, but he later realized that he should have done and been there more for me. He and I are friends but don't hang out, civil towards one another.

If you made it to the end, thanks for reading and I if this helps even one person, I am glad!",1,1768301192.0,Life,1,1.0,False

Has anyone else had this issue?

I’ve been in touch with aftersales and to be fair they’ve been really attentive and are trying to sort it out.

Unfortunately, the firmware update they gave me didn’t fix the problem and actually introduced a few new ones.

Originally, every single time the robot lowers its LiDAR to clean under low furniture (TV unit / coffee table), it fails to raise it back up afterwards. It then starts driving in circles, the position in the app is completely wrong, and it ignores no-go zones and drives straight into them until it gets stuck. I have to go and rescue it manually.

After the update, on top of that, it now:

- Randomly gets stuck under furniture and asks to be retrieved

https://youtu.be/KAeO7yo0s_0

- Once I left it to clean a zone in the kitchen after cooking, heard a loud noise, came back after it was done… and it had decided to take a shortcut over the chairs back to the dock, instead of going back the same way it came, around the table 🤦‍♂️

2’sday. 

I spent the last week further organizing the space in which I dwell. I exercised some, had some appointments (my pup had a grooming appointment and she’s so chuffed! So soft and she smells so nice). 

There was a point where I had access to a car, so I was driving around town like an Old Man, had a hat on and a cup of coffee and everything. Went to a few stores, shot the shit, cracked some jokes. I ended up at a card store, something I miss a lot. I bought some booster packs; I think Aetherdrift is my favorite Magic: the Gathering set in a *long* time.

I don’t really play MtG, but I’m a fan of trading cards. Over the years I’ve collected a bunch from random merchants or yard sales. It’s fun to build decks, look at the mechanics and the art, and sort them. I haven’t really had time to do that in over a decade, so it was a nice little break revisiting an old hobby/interest.

During this week I’ve also watched a couple of podcasts. “Mainstream Media” seems dead; but so are most things [when *Big Money* gets involved](https://www.reddit.com/r/TyrannyOfTime/s/pgdqWJDj5C). Remember when McDonald’s had ball pits and playgrounds? Remember when a TV was a TV and not some wall-mounted wiretap? Ah well.

So I’ve been enjoying the podcasts, and I took some notes. I have about 4.5 pages of notes I’ll try to write out around this corner of the web (is there even a web anymore? Isn’t it more of like a cube [rectangle perhaps?]?). I’ve missed Reddit, but it’s not fun when the algorithms and AI are employed to coerce or cajole us into “spiraling” about such in the world that we as individuals really have little to do with, let alone know if whatever is being presented is even real or manufactured or DeepFaked.

Been thinkin’ about yah. 

Today I hope to illuminate some concerns, comment on some happenings, repair some mistakes/misattributions, and shitpost as much as possible.

Oh, and I’d meant to make this subreddit TuesdayswithPhon*ie*, but ruined it with the “y”. Ah well, we all make mistakes right? At least I can admit it.

Last week, during our “casual professional” themed staff day (whatever that means), our new temp showed up wearing what can only be described as a full nanny uniform. Not a modern nanny vibe, I’m talking old-school Mary Poppins energy. Apron, collar, neat little buttons, the whole “I could discipline a Victorian child with just a stare” aesthetic.

She walks in confidently, clocking in like it’s totally normal, while the rest of us look like we rolled out of bed and fought over our clothes in the parking lot. My manager’s face did that slow blink people do when their brain temporarily disconnects from reality.

After a long silence, he finally says, “Uh… dress code?”

And she goes, completely deadpan, “Oh, this is my dress code. I nanny during lunch.”

Then lunch came around and the weirdest thing happened. She took her time going desk by desk and ensured that everyone was having lunch. Those that couldn’t leave their table, she calmly brought snacks, tea or coffee as requested. She was literally nannying after everyone in the marketing department. Until one unfortunate man said, ‘if you continue like this I won’t mind buying more nanny uniforms even if it means getting them from Alibaba’. And instantly, the air in the room thickened.

1qbo0vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microdiscectomy/comments/1qbo0vy/84_days_later/,84 days later,"I have always been very fortunate with my health and all my life I’ve tried to look after myself . At the ripe old age of 57 I was still playing football and doing HIT every morning. In October I was playing for my team on a Saturday and something really weird happened. I went to kick the ball and there was a ‘disconnect’ between my brain and my leg. Only happened once in the game and I didn’t think anything of it. A few days later I experienced some lower back pain but managed it by taking ibuprofen. As the days went by that pain spread to both legs and within a week I wasn’t able to stand let alone walk without excruciating pain. I ended up having to crawl around the house . I was convinced I had slipped a disc. One day I had to go out and pick my mother up from her sisters and I very gingerly stepped out of my house , trying to hold on to anything for support( walls etc) I took three steps but the pain was that bad I couldn’t move . I was stood on the pavement and cried because I was frightened. I rang my friend who came round to help me back in the house. I made an appointment to see a chiropractor the following day but when I went in he looked at me and said you need to get to a doctor and get an MRI . I went to the doctor who didn’t seem too concerned. I mentioned about an MRI and she said ‘we don’t do MRI referrals unless your bowels have failed’ She sent me for an x ray and said to expect the results within a week and prescribed me naproxen. A week went by and somehow I managed to get through it. Crawling , crying and I can honestly say I have never experienced such pain . My friend called round to see me and took a video of me trying to move around the house. He posted it and a couple of my friends saw it and immediately said that I need to get to hospital. My friend took me the accident and emergency clinic and while I was waiting they were giving me liquid morphine . I was given an emergency MRI and was told that I was exhibiting some CA symptoms and they were going to blue light me to a specialist neurosurgical hospital for emergency surgery. I was scared because I didn’t fully understand what was wrong with me but I thought that whatever it is I am going to feel a bit better afterwards. I was wheeled into the theatre and was really nervous especially when you see multiple people in masks hovering around the bed. 3 and a half hours later I was done. The surgical team came to see me in the morning and said the operation was a success but I still didn’t know what they had done. I had physio that morning, I couldn’t get my head around the fact that I could stand up without nerve pain albeit still on my crutches. The physio asked me to try and walk from one end of the ward to the other on my crutches. I did it and when I finished I cried with happiness- no pain ! I asked the physio if I could try and walk without crutches and reluctantly he agreed , I took two steps and nearly fell flat on my face ! Big wake up call !! I was discharged four days later. Post surgery was challenging mainly because I live on my own . My friends did my shopping, I was still using crutches so that brought about unexpected challenges such as cooking and even making a cup of coffee. I used to make a coffee and pour it into a plastic drinks bottle so I could put it in my pocket and hobble from kitchen to lounge. I used a plastic takeaway box for my food and did the same. A bit of a nuisance but one I could easily deal with given the fact that I wasn’t in pain . I borrowed an orthopaedic chair from my mother’s which was a lifesaver . High back and arm rests , it was the only thing I could sit on . Ten days later I had my staples out , I had avoided showering to keep the dressing dry which was a small price to pay. I must say although the incision was a bit painful,it was nothing compared to those staples being taken out , but once they had all gone it was a lot more comfortable sitting in the chair. I am now 8 weeks post surgery, fortunately for me I haven’t experienced any nerve pain but my surgeon told me the other week to expect tingles, pins and needles over the coming months but not to be alarmed and see it as a good sign of nerve regeneration. Last week I discarded my crutches , I can walk , get dressed , put my shoes on, go to the toilet , things that we can take for granted. My surgeon told me that I had a double discectomy, a Lam and the excision of a cyst at the base of my spine that was impacting on my sciatic nerve and was 1 mm from hitting my bladder and bowel nerves. He said I was days away from below the waist paralysis. I have spent a lot of time finding a muscular skeletal PT who I see once a month . She has been fantastic and given me some exercises to do to strengthen core and leg muscles. As of today I am able to walk a mile but feel absolutely exhausted afterwards. I know my recovery is going to take a long time . I hope one day to return to HIT and football but I am quite realistic and if that’s not possible then I will be just as happy being able to walk without pain . A long post for what has been a very short journey compared to most people. I had the worst two weeks of my life with these symptoms and I honestly at times thought I couldn’t do much longer but I know that most of you go through this pain for months even years and I cannot express my admiration enough for your resilience. I was such a lucky person and if I can help any of you out there with advice and support then I’m here. I will never tell you what to do or not to do because everyone’s different but simply tell you what worked for me . People shouldn’t have to cope with this on their own.

""My husband will hear about this immediately, and you'll be clearing out your desk before lunch.""

Because what I'm about to share with you involves the most satisfying revenge I've ever witnessed and you need to hear every single detail. Also, please like this story, subscribe, and click the bell icon because stories like this need to be heard. Let me take you back to how this all started. Eight months earlier, I'd been browsing freelance tutoring websites, looking for extra income to help pay off my student loans. My degree in international business came with a specialty in Mandarin Chinese, thanks to 2 years I'd spent studying in Beijing during college. I was fluent, but more importantly, I understood the cultural nuances that most Western learners missed completely. That's when I found the posting on Elite Academic Services, an exclusive tutoring platform for wealthy clients. Someone needed intensive Mandarin Lessons twice weekly at their residence. The pay was extraordinary, $300 per session. No name was listed, just an address in the most expensive part of the city and very specific requirements, complete discretion, professional appearance, and absolute confidentiality. I applied using my maiden name, Reese Morgan, instead of my married name that appeared on all my work documents. I styled my hair differently, wore glasses I didn't normally need, and dressed more conservatively than my usual office attire. When you're working with ultra-wealthy clients, they often prefer their staff to blend into the background. The penthouse was breathtaking. Floor to ceiling windows overlooked the entire city and everything inside screamed money. That's where I first met my student, though I had no idea who she really was. She introduced herself simply as Eva, and her attitude told me everything I needed to know about how she viewed people like me. ""You're here to teach me Mandarin,"" she announced without even a hello. ""I need to be conversational within 6 months. Not just basic phrases. I need to conduct business meetings, negotiate contracts, and sound sophisticated. Can you do that, or should I find someone else? I nodded politely. Absolutely. What's your current level? She waved her hand dismissively. I know some words. Let's just start. Within 10 minutes, I realized Eva knew almost nothing. She mispronounced basic greetings, mixed up tones completely, and became visibly frustrated when I corrected her. But she was determined. I'll give her that. Every session, she pushed herself harder, though she treated me like I was nothing more than a highly paid servant. ""Bring me coffee next time,"" she'd command at the end of lessons. ""And make sure you use the service entrance from now on. The doorman shouldn't see tutors coming through the main lobby. I needed the money, so I smiled and nodded. $600 a week was worth swallowing my pride."" As months passed, I learned more about Eva's motivation. She was working on what she called the deal of a lifetime, a joint venture with Chinese investors worth $50 million. She'd convinced everyone in her social circle that she was fluent in Mandarin, that she'd studied it extensively and that she was the perfect person to handle international negotiations. My husband thinks I'm naturally gifted with languages. She bragged during one session. Everyone at the country club is so impressed when I drop Mandarin phrases into conversation. They have no idea how business really works. The irony was painful. Eva could barely string together a coherent sentence in Mandarin. Even after months of intensive lessons, every word had to be written phonetically for her to pronounce correctly. Her grammar was elementary at best. But she was living in a fantasy where she was this sophisticated international businesswoman. Meanwhile, at my day job, I was actually doing the work she pretended to do. I'd built our company's Asian market division from nothing. I spoke with Chinese clients daily, handled complex negotiations, and had personally closed deals worth millions. But Eva, who I still didn't know was Evangelene Bowmont, was playing pretend with her husband's money. The breakthrough came 6 weeks before that terrible morning in my office. Eva was practicing her presentation for the Chinese investors and it was a disaster. She couldn't remember basic business terms, kept confusing yes and no, and was essentially speaking gibberish with a confident tone. This isn't working, I told her gently. You need more practice with fundamental concepts before attempting complex negotiations. Her face turned bright red. Are you saying I'm stupid? Not at all. Mandarin is incredibly difficult. Most people need years to reach business level fluency. I don't have years. She exploded. This presentation is everything to me. It's my chance to prove I belong in the business world, not just as some trophy wife. You have to make this work. That was the first time I saw real vulnerability in her. Beneath all the arrogance and entitlement was someone desperate to be taken seriously. I actually felt sorry for her. We'll work extra sessions. I promised I'll create phonetic scripts for your entire presentation. You can memorize it word for word. Her relief was obvious. You can't tell anyone about this. If people knew I was getting help, of course not. Client confidentiality is sacred to me. Over the next month and a half, I basically rewrote her entire presentation in phonetic Mandarin. We practiced for hours until she could recite it perfectly, though she still didn't understand what she was saying. I created backup materials, alternative phrases for different scenarios, and even coached her on proper bowing techniques and cultural customs. She started treating me slightly better during this period, not as an equal, but at least like a valued employee rather than disposable help. She'd offer me drinks, ask about my background, and occasionally say please and thank you. You're quite good at this, she admitted one evening. Where did you learn to speak so fluently? I told her about my studies in Beijing, my business degree, and my work in international markets. I was careful not to mention company names or specific details that might connect me to my day job. Impressive, she said, though her tone suggested she still saw me as hired help who just happened to be educated. You should consider working for a real company instead of just tutoring. If she only knew. Two weeks before the investor presentation, Eva was finally hitting her stride. She could deliver the entire pitch smoothly, answer basic questions, and even handle small talk about weather and travel. She was nowhere near fluent, but she could fake it well enough for a formal business meeting. I'm going to be magnificent, she declared after our final practice session. Those investors won't know what hit them. This deal will change everything. I smiled and packed up my materials. you've worked incredibly hard. I'm sure it will go well. That's when she made the comment that would haunt me later. You know, I'm attending a charity gala this weekend. It's for the children's hospital and all the important business people in the city will be there. I'll finally be able to show off my language skills to everyone. My heart sank. The company I worked for was a major sponsor of that same gayla. I'd be there representing our international division, sitting at our corporate table. There was a good chance I'd see Ava, though she still had no idea who I really was. I considered cancelling or at least warning her somehow, but I couldn't figure out how to do it without revealing my identity. Besides, what were the odds we'd actually interact? It was a huge event with hundreds of attendees. The gala was beautiful. Our company had purchased an entire table near the front, and I was seated with our senior management team and their spouses. I'd chosen an elegant black dress, styled my hair in an updo, and worn contact lenses instead of my usual glasses. I looked completely different from the conservative tutor Eva knew. Halfway through dinner, I spotted her across the room. She was radiant in a stunning silver gown, holding court at what was obviously the most prestigious table in the venue. She was animated, gesturing expressively as she spoke to the people around her, even from a distance. I could tell she was having the time of her life. Then I saw him, the man sitting beside her, nodding and smiling as she talked. My blood turned to ice as recognition hit me like a freight train. Ava was Evangelene Bowmont, the wife of my CEO, the woman I'd been tutoring for 8 months, was married to my boss. I spent the rest of the evening in a days barely touching my food, praying she wouldn't notice me. When dessert was served, I excused myself to use the restroom, hoping to avoid any chance encounters. But fate had other plans. As I was returning to my table, Evangelene was walking directly toward me. She was heading to greet someone at a nearby table, and our paths would intersect in seconds. I quickly sat down and focused intensely on my plate, hoping she'd pass by without paying attention to me. That's when everything went wrong. Ree? A voice called out. Reese Patterson. One of my colleagues was trying to get my attention from across the table. I looked up automatically, responding to my name just as Evangelene walked past. Our eyes met for exactly 2 seconds. I saw confusion flicker across her face like she almost recognized me but couldn't quite place where from. Then the moment passed and she continued walking. I thought I was safe. I thought those two seconds of near recognition wouldn't matter. I was so incredibly wrong. The next morning, she stormed into my office with murder in her eyes, and I finally understood what had happened. Evangeline had spent the entire night trying to figure out where she knew me from. When she couldn't place my face, she'd convinced herself that I'd deliberately snubbed her by not standing when she passed my table. In her mind, some random employee had disrespected the CEO's wife at a charity gala, and that simply could not be tolerated. ""Pack your things,"" my boss said after Evangelene finished her tirade and stormed out. His face was grim, and I could see the conflict in his eyes. ""I'm sorry, Ree. I really am. But I can't have this kind of drama at home."" I stared at him in disbelief. You're firing me because I didn't stand up fast enough when your wife walked by. She says you deliberately ignored her, that you made her look foolish in front of important people. That's insane. I was eating dinner and didn't even realize she was there. He sighed heavily. It doesn't matter. She's made up her mind, and arguing with her will only make things worse for both of us. I'll give you excellent references, and I'll make sure you get a generous severance package. I felt my entire world collapsing. Three years of perfect performance reviews, countless successful deals, relationships with clients who trusted me completely. All of it meant nothing because Evangelene Bowmont's pride had been wounded. That's when inspiration struck. ""Before I go,"" I said calmly, ""there's something you should know about your wife's big presentation with the Chinese investors."" I walked to my computer and opened my email account. With a few quick clicks, I sent him a message with video attachments from every single tutoring session I'd recorded for my own reference. ""Check your email,"" I said quietly. His face went pale as he opened the first video. There was Evangelene stumbling through basic Mandarin phrases, asking me to repeat everything phonetically, admitting she couldn't understand what she was saying. ""She's been lying to you,"" I continued. ""For 8 months, I've been her private tutor. She can't speak Mandarin beyond memorized scripts. Everything she's told you about her language abilities is completely false. I removed my glasses and let my hair down, transforming back into the person Evangelene knew as her tutor. I'm Reys Morgan, I said, and effective immediately. Your wife's Mandarin lessons are cancelled. The silence in that office was deafening. My boss sat frozen, staring at the computer screen where his wife was clearly struggling with pronunciation that any firstear language student would master easily. The video showed her asking me over and over to write everything in English letters because she couldn't read Chinese characters. This presentation is in 3 days, he whispered, his voice barely audible. I know. I helped her prepare every word of it. She's memorized it like a script, but she doesn't understand what she's saying. If anyone asks her an unscripted question in Mandarin, or if she needs to deviate from her prepared remarks even slightly, the whole thing will collapse. He looked up at me with something between horror and disbelief. Why didn't you tell me who you were during the lessons? Client confidentiality. She hired me through a tutoring service under strict privacy agreements. I had no idea she was your wife until last night at the gala. Even then, I plan to keep her secret because that's what professionals do. I gathered the last of my personal items from my desk. But since she's decided to destroy my career over an imaginary slight, I figure those confidentiality agreements are void. Wait. He stood up quickly. Don't leave yet. We need to discuss this. There's nothing to discuss. Your wife made her choice. I'm just making sure you understand what that choice actually costs. I walked toward the door, then paused. Those Chinese investors aren't just bringing money to this deal. They're bringing their top executives, their translators, and their cultural liaison. People who will immediately recognize whether your wife can actually communicate or if she's just reciting memorized phrases. The door closed behind me with a soft click, and I walked out of that building for what I thought would be the last time. But I was wrong about that, too. The next 3 days passed in a blur of job applications and angry phone calls from Evangelene. Apparently, my boss had confronted her about the tutoring sessions, and she was furious that I'd betrayed her trust. You signed confidentiality agreements. She screamed during one particularly unpleasant voicemail. I'll sue you for everything you have. I called her back once, mainly out of curiosity. Actually, Evangelene, you should read those agreements more carefully. They protect client privacy from outside parties, but they don't prevent tutors from defending themselves when clients attempt to damage their careers through false accusations. I never made false accusations. You told your husband I deliberately disrespected you at the gala, but you and I both know you didn't recognize me there. You're destroying my reputation based on a completely fictional narrative you created in your head. The line went quiet for a long moment. Then you're still fired. Yes, I am. And your presentation is tomorrow. Good luck. I hung up and tried to put the whole mess behind me. I had bigger problems to worry about, like finding a new job and explaining to potential employers why I'd left my previous position so suddenly. But I couldn't stop thinking about those Chinese investors. Some of them were people I'd worked with professionally over the past 3 years. Mr. Cheni from Beijing Manufacturing who always started meetings with personal questions about family. Miss Lu Hong from Shanghai Logistics who appreciated cultural references and traditional greetings. They were coming to this presentation expecting to meet someone who understood their language and their business customs. Instead, they were about to encounter Evangelene Bowmont with her memorized script and her complete ignorance of everything beyond basic pronunciation. The morning of the presentation, I woke up with a knot in my stomach. I kept imagining how it would unfold, how quickly the investors would realize they were being deceived, how badly it would reflect on everyone involved. Around 10:00, my phone rang. It was James Morrison, my former boss, and he sounded desperate. Ree, I need your help. I don't work there anymore. Remember, the investors are here early. They wanted to have lunch before the presentation and Evangelene is panicking. She can't handle casual conversation in Mandarin. She's locked herself in the bathroom and won't come out. I almost felt sorry for her. Almost. That's unfortunate, but it's not my problem anymore. I'll give you your job back. Full reinstatement, a promotion, a raise, whatever you want. Just please help us get through this presentation. I considered it for exactly 3 seconds. No, Ree, please. This deal is worth $50 million to the company. If it falls apart, we'll have to lay off half the international division. Then you should have thought about that before you fired me for not standing up fast enough when your wife walked by. I know I made a mistake. I was wrong and I'm sorry, but please don't let our employees suffer because of my bad judgment. That hit me harder than I expected. The International Division wasn't just my work. It was built with the help of amazing colleagues who didn't deserve to lose their jobs because of this mess. I'll make you a deal, I said. Finally, I'll come in as a consultant one time only. I'll help with translation during the presentation, but I'm not doing it to save Evangeline's reputation. I'm doing it to protect the people who still work there. Thank you. Thank you so much. And James, after today, I never want to see or speak to your wife again. I arrived at the office 45 minutes before the presentation was scheduled to begin. The main conference room had been transformed into an impressive setup with multimedia displays, translated materials, and elegant catering that showed respect for Chinese business culture. Evangelene was standing near the windows practicing her opening remarks under her breath. She looked beautiful and professional, but I could see the terror in her eyes when she noticed me walking in. What is she doing here? she hissed at her husband. Helping to save your presentation, I replied calmly. Unless you'd prefer to handle the Q&A session on your own. Her face went pale. We both knew she couldn't handle unscripted questions. Fine, but you stay in the background. This is my presentation, my deal, my moment. Understood. The investors arrived precisely on time, which I'd expected. Mr. Cheni greeted me in Mandarin and I responded appropriately, introducing myself as a consultant supporting the presentation. Miss Liu Hong asked about my background in Chinese markets and we had a brief pleasant conversation about trade relationships. I could see Evangeline watching our exchange with growing anxiety. The investors were clearly comfortable with me, but when she attempted to join the conversation with her stilted, rehearsed phrases, their polite smiles became strained. ""Perhaps we should begin the formal presentation,"" Mr. Chen suggested in English, clearly sensing the awkwardness. Evangelene took her position at the front of the room and launched into her prepared remarks. I had to admit, months of practice had paid off. Her pronunciation was decent, and she delivered the memorized content with confidence. The investors listened politely, taking notes and occasionally nodding. Everything was going according to plan. Then, Miss Lu Hong raised her hand. ""Excuse me,"" she said in Mandarin. ""Could you clarify the logistics timeline for the Shanghai distribution center?"" Evangeline's face went blank. The question wasn't part of her script. I'm sorry, she said in English. Could you repeat that? Ms. Lu Hong repeated the question, this time, speaking more slowly and clearly. Evangeline looked at me desperately. I could have helped her. I could have translated the question and coached her through an answer. Instead, I remained silent. I I think, Evangelene stammered, attempting to respond in broken Mandarin that made no grammatical sense. Mr. Cheni frowned and exchanged glances with his colleagues. They were beginning to understand that something was very wrong. Perhaps, Mr. Chen said diplomatically, we could continue the discussion in English, but the damage was already done. The investors had come here expecting to work with someone who could communicate effectively in their language. They'd been promised a partner who understood Chinese business culture and could facilitate smooth international cooperation. Instead, they discovered that their primary contact had essentially been lying about her qualifications. Miss Lu Hong asked another question, this time in English, about regulatory compliance in Shanghai. It was a basic question that anyone involved in Chinese business should be able to answer easily. Evangelene clearly had no idea what to say. She looked at her husband, then at me, then back at the investors. Perhaps my consultant could address that,"" she said weekly. I stepped forward and answered the question thoroughly, explaining the regulatory framework, recent changes in compliance requirements, and best practices for foreign companies operating in Shanghai. The investors nodded appreciatively and began directing their follow-up questions to me instead of Evangelene. For the next 20 minutes, I essentially took over the presentation. I answered detailed questions about logistics, cultural considerations, legal requirements, and market analysis. The investors were engaged and interested, clearly impressed with the depth of knowledge I was providing. Evangeline stood to the side, completely sidelined at her own presentation. Finally, Mr. Cheni addressed the elephant in the room. ""I'm confused about the structure of this partnership,"" he said carefully. ""We were told that Mrs. Bowmont would be our primary liaison, but it seems clear that Miss He looked at me questioningly. Patterson, I supplied. Miss Patterson has the expertise we need for this collaboration. Could you clarify who would actually be managing this relationship? The room fell silent. Evangeline's husband looked like he wanted to disappear. Evangelene herself was staring at the floor, her face bright red with humiliation. I think, I said gently, there may have been some miscommunication about roles and responsibilities. Perhaps it would be best to reschedule this discussion after the organizational structure can be clarified. Mr. Cheni nodded gravely. I think that would be wise. The investors gathered their materials and prepared to leave. Miss Lu Hong approached me privately. We were very impressed with your knowledge and professionalism, she said quietly. If you were to represent this company in future negotiations, we would be very interested in proceeding. However, we cannot work with someone who has misrepresented their qualifications so significantly. After the investors left, the conference room felt like a tomb. Evangeline was sitting in a chair, staring at her hands. Her husband was pacing near the windows. And I was gathering my notes, preparing to leave for good. $50 million, James said quietly. gone. It was never really there, I replied. You can't build international partnerships on lies and pretense. Those investors are too smart and too experienced to be fooled for long. Evangelene finally looked up. This is all your fault. I turned to face her directly. No, Evangelene. This is the consequence of your choices. You chose to lie about your qualifications. You chose to destroy my career over a perceived slight that existed only in your imagination. You chose to prioritize your ego over the success of this deal. I worked so hard on this presentation. You memorized words you didn't understand for a deal you weren't qualified to handle. That's not work. That's performance art. I walked toward the door, then paused. For what it's worth, I actually felt sorry for you during those tutoring sessions. You seemed so desperate to prove yourself, to be taken seriously. But respect isn't something you can fake or demand. It's something you earn through competence, integrity, and treating other people with basic human dignity. You're still fired, she said weekly. I laughed. Evangelene, after today, I wouldn't work for this company again if you begged me. But I was wrong about that, too. Two weeks later, James Morrison called me with an interesting proposition. The board of directors had been less than pleased when they learned about the failed investor presentation and the circumstances surrounding my termination. Apparently, several board members had worked with me professionally over the years and were furious that I'd been fired over such trivial reasons. ""We'd like to offer you the position of vice president of international business development,"" James said. It comes with a substantial salary increase, your own budget, and complete autonomy over the international division. What about Evangelene? She's no longer involved in business operations. The board made that very clear. I considered the offer carefully. I'll take it, but with conditions. First, I want a written guarantee that family members of executives cannot interfere with personnel decisions. Second, I want the authority to rebuild the international division my way without interference from anyone. Done. And third, I want a formal apology from the company for my wrongful termination to be included in my personnel file. Absolutely. 6 months later, I'd rebuilt the Chinese investor relationship and successfully closed the deal Evangelene had destroyed. The Shanghai partnership was worth $68 million more than the original proposal and led to additional opportunities throughout Asia. Evangelene, meanwhile, had become something of a pariah in her social circle. Word had spread quickly about her failed presentation and fabricated language skills. The same people who had once been impressed by her Mandarin phrases now whispered about her dishonesty and poor judgment. I heard through office gossip that she'd tried to blame me for sabotaging her presentation, but too many people had witnessed what actually happened. The investors themselves had made it clear that the problem wasn't sabotage. It was incompetence masked as expertise. The final piece of poetic justice came 8 months after that disastrous presentation. James Morrison approached me with a delicate request. The board is considering some changes in executive structure, he said carefully. They're impressed with your work rebuilding the international division and they're wondering if you'd be interested in taking on additional responsibilities such as they're thinking about creating a new position senior vice president of global operations. It would involve overseeing all international business including partnerships, acquisitions, and strategic planning. I smiled. That sounds like the kind of role that would require reporting directly to the board of directors. It would and presumably it would involve significant decision-making authority over the direction of the company's international strategy. That's correct. I pretended to consider the offer. I accept. 3 months later, I was officially promoted to senior vice president of global operations, making me one of the most senior executives in the company. My office was two floors above James Morrison's, and my authority extended across every international deal the company pursued. Evangelene never spoke to me again after that presentation, which was exactly what I'd hoped for. But I heard she'd started taking Spanish lessons from a different tutoring service, probably planning some new scheme to establish herself as an international business expert. I hoped her new tutor was more patient than I'd been. The irony of the whole situation wasn't lost on me. Evangelene had tried to destroy my career because she felt I hadn't shown her proper respect. But her vindictive behavior had ultimately led to the exposure of her lies, the failure of her business ambitions, and my promotion to a position with more authority than she'd ever dreamed of having. Sometimes the universe has a sense of humor about these things. Looking back, I realized that those eight months of tutoring sessions had taught me something valuable about people like Evangelene. They're so focused on appearing important that they forget to actually become competent. They mistake performance for substance, arrogance for confidence, and entitlement for leadership. But the business world has a way of exposing pretense eventually. You can only fake expertise for so long before reality catches up with you. And when it does, you better hope the people you've stepped on aren't in a position to step back. Now, I want to hear from you.
