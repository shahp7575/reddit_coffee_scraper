after starting Levo now on month 4, my TSH is down to 2 from 8,5. So far so good.

Blood work show most normal, but natrium a bit low. Weird, since I eat normal food and a pinch of salt every day.

This must be the increased kidney activity, right? I mean the frequent need to pee and more color. I drink plenty of water, tea, coffee so in no way dehydrated. Like 16oz every other hour or so.

Anyone else have low natrium? Just asking, if I should check my kidneys or something …

Then after two days of chatting I decided to ask her out for a coffee, to which she basically just responded ""I'm feeling really unwell right now, but in 1-2 weeks it'll probably pass and I'd be down to meet up! :)"" 

I was trying to be nice and told her that it's fine and offered that we can just text until she feels better.   
And welp she didn't text after that... About a week later and still nothing I pretty sure that nothing would come and that she just ghosted me, because I could see her online on Discord the entire day and deep into the night everytime I played with my friends. 

So I decided that probably nothing's gonna come back from her and I unmatched her on the app and unfriended on Discord.   
Then yesterday the day right after I did that, at midnight all of a sudden she just texts me ""Heyy I'd be down to meet up this week :D""   
No mention of the silence or not even a little sorry for not responding to my offer. And like I'm just so confused right because it feels like she just texted because she saw that I unfriended her, but that could be coincedence and me overthinking.

1p064md,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1p064md/helpful_japanese_phrases_words_and_kanji_for/,"Helpful Japanese Phrases, Words, and Kanji for Travelers","I just got back from my trip to Japan with my partner, and before I write about my experiences and reviews of places, I want to start by talking about the language and add some helpful tips for folks who don’t speak/know much Japanese. For reference, I’m a beginner-intermediate (somewhere between N5-4) level, I know N5 kanji and am familiar with several N4. My partner knows 0 Japanese and learned some basic phrases while we were in Japan. The difference of our experiences interpersonally was noticeable. 

*A note - some of my romaji (romanized Japanese) spelling may be wrong because I use furigana and kana pretty exclusively in my own Japanese study, but wanted to make this accessible to folks who want try interacting with others without Google Translate as much, but don’t know Japanese!*

#Some helpful words/phrases/kanji to know for your trip:
##Greetings/phrases:
* Ohayo gozaimasu - good morning 
* Konnichiwa - hello/good afternoon (you say this between 12p - dark) 
* Konbanwa - good evening 
* Sumimasen - excuse me/I’m sorry (use this when trying to get a waiter’s attention or if you need to get by someone)
* Gomen nasai - I’m sorry (more serious, like if you physically bump into someone or something like that)
* Arigatou gozaimasu - thank you very much (domo arigatou gozaimasu = formal thank you very much)
*There’s a note on using arigatou gozaimasu in restaurants in the food/dining section.*
* Wakarimasu/wakarimasen - I know/don’t know/understand 
*(“Eigo ga wakarimasu ka?” Do you know English?)* 
*(“Nihongo ga wakarimasen” I don’t know Japanese)*
* Daijobu (desu) - fine, it’s fine 
*If you have tattoos and want to ask if an onsen is tattoo-friendly, you can say “tattoo wa daijobu desu ka?”*
* Keko desu - no thanks (“nah, I’m good.”) — you can also just make an X with your arms and say daijobu desu instead 
* “Cho-to ma-te kudasai” - please wait a moment (this is helpful if you’re stuck in a conversation and you need to get your phone out to translate, or something like that).
* Hai/eeh - yes (hai is more formal) 
* Ie - no 
* ゴミ “gomi” - trash 
* 日本 - Nihon (Japan)
* 日本語- nihongo (Japanese language)
* 英語 - Eigo (English language)
*日本人 - nihon-jin(Japanese people)
* Amerika-jin - American person
* Eigirisu-jin - English/British person
* Ostoraria-jin - Australian person
* Nyu-Jiirando-Jin - New Zealand person
* Fransu-jin - French person
…. You get it. You can say [nationality-jin]desu” to say “I’m [nationality]”

In my experience, if I started a conversation with someone in Japanese, like saying ohayo gozaimasu, most people responded in Japanese. One of the first questions people will ask is “doko kuni kimashita?” = what country are you from? Just listen for “doko kuni” … “doko” means “where” so if you’re from the USA like me, some people will follow up by asking “doko” again to ask what state I was from. Sometimes people say “doko kara kimashita” which is “where did you come from?” You can say “[country/state] kara” to respond. I don’t think I ever said “Amerika-jin desu” because of that. 

*More conversational notes further below*

##Directions/Places:
* “_____ wa doko desu ka?” = where is ____?
* 公園 - (koen) park
* 東京 - Tokyo
* 駅- (eki) station 
* 電車 - (densha) train
* バース bus
* 右(migi) - right 
* 左(hidari) - left 
*You will hear “deguchi wa migi/hidari kawa desu” on the trains, it is telling you if the door will open on the left or right. Sometimes the English version doesn’t announce on time.* 
* 入る - enter 
* 出口- exit 
* 上(ue) -up
* 下 (shita)- down 
* 北 (kita)- north
* 南 (minami) - south
* 東(higashi) - east
* 西 (nishi)- west
* Koko = here
* Asoko = there (not adding kanji b/c you’ll hear these more than see them) 

##Things/transactions:
* kore (“ko-rae”)- this 
* Sore (“so-rae”)- that 
* Nan desu ka? - what is (this/that)? 
* Onegaishimasu/kudasai - please (it’s more complicated, but you get the gist. Onegaishimasu is more polite) 
* Ikura desu ka? - how much is it? (So “kore wa ikura desu ka?” = how much is this)
* “Dozo” - here you are/go ahead (when giving money to someone, if you want to let someone go ahead of you in a line, etc.) This one has many meanings, you’ll hear it a lot.
*Less places are using the trays and some will take your card or money straight from your hand. If you want to be really polite/respectful, you can bow a little and offer the money/card with both hands and say “hai, dozo” or just “dozo.” They will appreciate it, reciprocate, and thank you.
If you want to know if they take card or cash you can say “ka-do wa ii desu ka?”or “genkin wa ii desu ka?” Or you can say “ka-do/genkin wa daijobu desu ka?”* 
* 現金Genkin = cash 
* カードka-do = card 
* irimasu/irimasen = need/don’t need (can also say iranai for don’t need, it’s more casual but you will hear it a lot)


##Numbers:
* 円 - yen 
* 一、二、三、四、五、六、七、八、九、十
* Ichi, ni, san, yon, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyu, juu 
* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

* 百、千、万
* Hyaku, sen, man*
* 100, 1000, 10,000 (100 and 1000 are that way by themselves but you have to add ichi before man for 10k, aka “ichi man”.) 

Numbers are kind of different in Japanese - you would say “ten, one” for 11 “juu-ichi” or “two, 1 thousand” for 2k “ni-sen.” 
It gets complicated when you have a number like 583 “go hyaku, hachi-juu-san” aka “5 100, 8 10, 3” 
3 (san) is irregular “sen-zen” and “san-byaku”
There are lots of places that have the numbers listed Japanese style, so vertically and with the kanji like such:
* 五
* 〇
* 〇
* 円
* (500 yen)

##Dining:
*You can point to something on the menu and say “kore onegaishimasu” or “kore kudasai” if you’re overwhelmed.* 
* Tabemasu = to eat 
* nomimasu - to drink
* Nani-ka = something
* Nani-mo = nothing 
* 水 - water (mizu)
* コヒ - coffee (“ko-hi”) 
* 茶- tea (cha) 
* 黒茶black tea “kuro cha” 
* 緑茶green tea “ryoku cha” 
* ビール - beer “biiru”
* ラーメン、らーめん ramen (I saw both katakana and hiragana signs) 
* やきとり yakitori 

* *You’ll hear “irashaimase” when you enter a restaurant. It’s especially boisterous in ramen shops. It means welcome [:* 
**You will need to flag down your waiter when you’re ready to order, if you want to order more, and when you want the check. You can raise your hand and say “sumimasen” and someone will notice.** 
* “Checku onegaishimasu/kudasai” - check please 
* あたたかい“A-ta-ta-kai” -hot/warm (i.e. “atatakai kohi, onegaishimasu” for hot coffee)
* つめたい “su-me-tai” - cold
*You’ll see this kana on vending machines, but they’re also usually color coded with blue or red to indicate warm or cold beverages. You’ll get asked if you want coffee/tea hot or iced though, if you don’t indicate when you order.* 

* “______ wa arimasu ka?” = Do you have _____? 
*You can ask if a place has coffee, beer, ramen, w/e by saying this. Arimasu/arimasen literally means “to exist (for inanimate objects)”, so you are asking if the thing exists in the space you’re in.* 
* “Oiishii desu” - it’s tasty/delicious (if you say “oiishii desu ne” to waitstaff they will appreciate it)
* “Amai”- sweet
* “Hiitotsu”- one/singular 
* “Futatsu” - two/both 

If you are with someone and you’re ordering the same thing you can say “futatsu [order] onegaishimasu/kudasai” or if you are ordering different things you can say “hiitotsu [order]….” 

*I’m not sure if this is accurate to what a native Japanese speaker would say, but it worked fine for me: if you want to pay separately you can ask “hiitotsu, hiitotsu wa daijobu desu ka?” Or they might ask if you’re cashing out somewhere “hiitotsu ka Futatsu?” Which is essentially “separate or together?”* 

* *If you feel weird about saying “arigatou gozaimasu” every time a waiter brings your something, you can also say “domo” or “arigatou”*
* “Itadakimasu” - a gratitude statement before eating 
* “Gochisou-sama-deshita” - this is a thank you statement to the restaurant staff who put effort into your meal. You can say this to your waiter after you pay as you’re leaving or to the staff if you’re at a ramen place or izakaya. 

*You will hear “omataseishimashita” which is “sorry to make you wait” or “thanks for waiting” and you may hear “kashikomarimashita” which is “very well/certainly/as you wish” (this is more in a formal setting where someone is serving you).* 

##Bathroom-related kanji:
* トイレ (toi-re)、お手洗い (o-te-a-rai)- toilet/bathroom
* 大 (big) /小 (small) - you will see these on toilets. They refer to the amount of water used in flushing. I don’t think I need to say more than that… 
* ビデ - bidet 
* 止- stop 

##Some other fun things if you want to try to have more of a conversation without your phone!
* Itsu = when
* Itsu-mo = always 
* Dono guari = how long (“dono gurai koko ni imasu ka?” = “how long are you here for?”) 
* Kon-shuu - this week
* Sen-shuu - last week
* Rai-shuu - next week
* Ii-shuu-kan - one week
* Ni-shuu-kan - two weeks 
* Hito-tsuki - one month 
* Ryo-ko - trip/travel 
*You can say “nihon ni ichiban no ryo-ko desu” to say “it’s my first trip to Japan” — I’m not sure if this is grammatically correct but people will know what you mean.* 
* Jozu = skilled 
You may hear “nihongo ga jozu desu ne” which means “your Japanese is good” basically. Japanese folks will be very complimentary of your Japanese if you try speaking with them. This happened to me when I did simple things like count my money in Japanese. You can also say “nihongo ga musugashi desu ne” to say “Japanese is difficult” 
* “…desu ne” - kind of like saying “….isn’t it?” Like in a rhetorical way. So you can say “ii tenki desu ne” to say “good weather, isn’t it?” Or “oiishii desu ne” to say the food is delicious somewhere. 

* Tanoshii - fun/pleasant 
* Ka-koii - cool, stylish, trendy, attractive
* Sugoi - awesome, amazing, cool 
* Kirei - pretty (don’t get it mixed up with kirai, which is dislike)
* Suki - to like something (i.e. “shinrin ga suki desu” = “I like forests/the woods”) 
* Kirai - to dislike something (i.e. “bi-ru ga kirai desu”= “I dislike beer”) 

I hope this is helpful to some and not just a neurospicy infodump! がんばって!!

## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive framework that synthesizes epistemology, mathematics, phenomenology, cognitive science, psychology, and sociology to explore the limits of justification through the **Reason operator (R)**—a formal construct transforming the imperative ""Reason it"" into a rigorous demand for proof, derivation, and explanatory warrant. We define **two Principles of Justification**:

- **PJ₁ (Sufficientist)**: Permits termination in sufficient, pragmatic, empirical, or socially accepted grounds, allowing everyday, scientific, and societal inquiry to proceed without infinite regress.  
- **PJ₂ (Closureist)**: Requires complete, self-justifying closure, rendering all chains infinite and leading to epistemic collapse.

The **No Man's Theorem** is rigorously proven: under PJ₂, the **three ultimate whys**—**Why(E)** (external: ""Why is there something rather than nothing?""), **Why(I)** (internal: ""Why did I ask why?""), and **Why(M)** (meta: ""Why does self-reflection exist?"")—generate non-terminating regress via iterative application of R, making them mathematically undecidable and epistemologically unanswerable. Everyday ""whys"" terminate under PJ₁ but collapse under PJ₂, highlighting the theorem's scope across individual cognition and collective knowledge systems.

This incompleteness manifests as **Cendipite's Collapse Principle**: the inevitable logical and reasoning collapse at the boundaries of inquiry, involving default mode network (DMN) hyperactivation, prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction, and broader socio-psychological dynamics of suppressed inquiry. The framework's utility lies in its diagnostic power for philosophy, science, cognition, AI safety, education, clinical psychology, and sociology, offering tools for pragmatic resilience while illuminating the boundaries of logic and reasoning in both personal and cultural contexts.

## 1. Introduction: The Roots of ""Why"" in Human Inquiry

The question ""Why is there something rather than nothing?""—famously articulated by Leibniz (1714) and deepened by Heidegger (1929)—is not merely a philosophical curiosity. It is a **fundamental cognitive imperative**, a **structural demand of rational thought**, and a **gateway to the vertigo of reasoning**. Rooted in the human capacity for reflection, it challenges the foundations of being, knowing, and self-awareness. This paper redefines justification not as subjective wonder, causal inquiry, or linguistic habit, but as an **imperative command**: ""Reason it,"" formalized as the **Reason operator (R)**, demanding derivable warrant at every level of inquiry.

In psychological and sociological terms, humans rarely invoke full justificatory chains in daily life. As Kahneman (2011) notes in *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, System 1 thinking—intuitive and automatic—dominates, accepting ""facts"" like ""Water freezes at 0°C"" without probing mechanisms. Yet beneath this lies a latent complexity: the deeper chains of biochemistry, quantum interactions, and thermodynamic laws demand R, which modern society often suppresses for efficiency (Latour, 1987, *Science in Action*). Philosophers, by contrast, habitually apply R, exposing the fragility of unexamined acceptance. This tension—between shallow certainty and exhaustive warrant—underpins the regress problem and motivates our framework.

Traditional philosophy has grappled with justification through diverse lenses: Aristotle's four causes (material, formal, efficient, final) in *Physics* (350 BCE), Kant's synthetic a priori judgments in *Critique of Pure Reason* (1781), and Heidegger's ontological difference in *Being and Time* (1927). Modern epistemology, from foundationalism (Chisholm, 1977) to coherentism (BonJour, 1985) and reliabilism (Goldman, 1979), confronts the **regress problem**: how does justification avoid infinite descent, circularity, or arbitrary termination? The **Münchhausen trilemma** (Agrippa, ancient skeptic) underscores this: justification leads to regress, circularity, or unfounded stops.

Cendipite's framework resolves this by constructing the **No Man's Theorem**: under strict justificatory standards (PJ₂), certain questions—the **three ultimate whys**—admit no resolution, leading to **logical collapse** (mathematical/logical level) and **reasoning collapse** (psychological/philosophical level). We define **two Principles of Justification** (PJ₁ and PJ₂) to delineate practical sufficiency from absolute closure, then formalize **R** as a mathematical operator. This allows precise analysis of **everyday whys** (which terminate pragmatically under PJ₁) versus **ultimate whys** (which do not under PJ₂).

The theorem's implications are multifaceted:
- **Epistemological**: Infinite regress at ultimate levels collapses certainty.  
- **Mathematical**: Non-terminating proof chains demonstrate undecidability.  
- **Phenomenological**: Lived failure evokes reasoning collapse, amplified by neural mechanisms.  
- **Psychological/Sociological**: Explains rumination as individual pathology and ""fact-culture"" as collective suppression of R.  
- **Practical**: Diagnostic for cognitive limits; therapeutic for logical paralysis; critical for societal inquiry.

This paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 details the Principles of Justification, incorporating psychological and sociological dimensions; Section 3 formalizes the Reason operator; Section 4 analyzes everyday whys; Section 5 explains the No Man's Theorem in depth; Section 6 applies the theorem to the three ultimate whys, with structural analogies; Section 7 explores the Collapse Principle and its cognitive neuroscience; Section 8 discusses applications and utility across domains; and Section 9 concludes.

## 2. The Principles of Justification

Justification is the bedrock of epistemology, the process by which beliefs achieve warrant and become knowledge. As defined by Gettier (1963), knowledge is ""justified true belief,"" but justification itself is contested. The **regress problem**, originating with Aristotle (*Posterior Analytics*, 350 BCE), poses: if P is justified by Q, what justifies Q? This yields three options—infinite regress, circularity, or arbitrary stop—all problematic. Cendipite resolves this tension by positing **two principles**, contrasting pragmatic sufficiency with absolute rigor, while extending to psychological habits and sociological norms.

### 2.1. PJ₁: The Sufficientist Principle of Justification

**Formal Statement**: A proposition **P** is justified if **R(P)** terminates in a **sufficient ground**—one that is empirically verifiable, axiomatically primitive, pragmatically adequate, or socially accepted for the context of inquiry.

**Philosophical Roots**: PJ₁ aligns with **pragmatist epistemology** (Peirce, 1878; Dewey, 1938), where truth is what ""works"" in practice, and **reliabilism** (Goldman, 1979), where justification arises from reliable processes. It echoes Hume's (1739) emphasis on empirical sufficiency, halting chains at sensory data or habitual beliefs.

**Psychological and Sociological Dimensions**: Psychologically, PJ₁ reflects bounded rationality (Simon, 1957), where cognitive resources limit exhaustive R, favoring heuristics (Kahneman, 2011). Sociologically, it underpins ""fact-culture"" (Latour, 1987), where communities accept termini like empirical laws without deeper chains, enabling social coordination but risking dogmatism (Berger & Luckmann, 1966, *The Social Construction of Reality*).

**Key Features**:
- **Termination Criterion**: Halt when the explanation is ""good enough"" for the purpose (e.g., predictive power, coherence with evidence, or communal consensus).  
- **Rationale**: Human cognition is resource-limited; absolute demands lead to paralysis. Justification is **instrumental**, enabling action and social stability.  
- **Epistemic Status**: **Provisional certainty**—knowledge is reliable but fallible; truth is operational, not absolute.  
- **Risks**: Complacency at foundations; potential for error propagation if ""sufficient"" is too lenient; societal suppression of critical R.

**Examples**:
- **Everyday Causal Why**: ""Why did my coffee spill?"" → ""I bumped the table"" → Empirical observation (sensory evidence) → Halt: sufficient for immediate action (clean up).  
- **Scientific Why**: ""Why does DNA replicate?"" → ""Base pairing in double helix"" → Empirical verification (Watson & Crick, 1953) → Halt: sufficient for biology.  
- **Practical Why**: ""Why pursue career X?"" → ""Financial stability and fulfillment"" → Pragmatic assessment (personal utility) → Halt: sufficient for decision-making.  
- **Sociological Why**: ""Why accept 'Water freezes at 0°C'?"" → Communal consensus (scientific authority) → Halt: sufficient for engineering and daily life, despite latent quantum depths.

Under PJ₁, justification is **finite and functional**, supporting science, ethics, and daily life without collapse. However, it sacrifices depth for utility, collapsing ultimate inquiry into mere belief and fostering uncritical societal norms.

### 2.2. PJ₂: The Closureist Principle of Justification

**Formal Statement**: A proposition **P** is justified **only if** **R(P)** terminates in a **complete, self-justifying foundation**—necessarily true, non-contingent, and fully derivable without brute facts, pragmatic halts, empirical termination, or social acceptance. Every link must be warranted by the next, culminating in a self-grounding axiom.

**Philosophical Roots**: PJ₂ draws from **rationalism** (Descartes, 1641, *Meditations*), demanding indubitable foundations, and **coherentism's strict variant** (Blanshard, 1939), but rejects circularity in favor of linear closure. It echoes Leibniz's (1714) Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR): ""Nothing happens without sufficient reason,"" extended to absolute termination.

**Psychological and Sociological Dimensions**: Psychologically, PJ₂ evokes obsessive rumination (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000), where failure to terminate amplifies anxiety. Sociologically, it critiques ""shallow certainty"" in modern institutions, where suppressed R leads to vulnerability (e.g., scientific scandals from unexamined assumptions; see Merton, 1973, *The Sociology of Science*).

**Key Features**:
- **Termination Criterion**: Halt **only** at self-evident truths (e.g., logical necessities like ""A = A"") or necessary existents (e.g., a self-grounding ontology). No ""good enough"" or consensus—**all** must derive from the absolute.  
- **Rationale**: True knowledge requires **absolute warrant**; partial chains are illusions (Descartes' evil demon). Justification is **foundational**, preserving epistemology as an active, warrant-building process.  
- **Epistemic Status**: **Absolute certainty** or **radical skepticism**—no middle ground; truth is warrantable, not assumable.  
- **Risks**: Paralysis of inquiry; potential for total skepticism if no self-grounding level exists; psychological exhaustion from unrelenting R.

**Defense Against Quietist Objections**: Critics may claim PJ₂ is ""unreasonable,"" as no serious epistemologist demands absolute closure (e.g., reliabilists like Goldman, 1979, favor reliable processes over indubitable foundations). However, PJ₂ is not a practical requirement but the **regulative ideal** of rationality (Kant, 1781), representing reason's internal logic when pushed to limits. Contemporary foundationalists like Plantinga (1974) seek warrant for beliefs via ""proper function,"" echoing PJ₂'s demand for non-arbitrary grounds. Moreover, we don't know if ""sufficient"" is truly sufficient—whether to stop at atoms or probe quarks, at 1000 or infinity. PJ₂ maintains justification as an **active process**, ensuring certainty through relentless derivation. Without it, PJ₁'s halts collapse epistemology into passive assumption, where no active validation occurs, and truth dissolves into unexamined belief—no certainty, no epistemology. Sociologically, this ideal counters complacency in ""fact-culture,"" urging deeper communal R.

**The Absurdity and Undecidability of PJ₂ Under Descartes' Cogito**:  
PJ₂'s rigor is vividly illustrated—and its absurdity and undecidability exposed—in Descartes' *Cogito ergo sum* (""I think, therefore I am,"" 1641). The Cogito is often hailed as the self-grounding foundation of modern philosophy, an indubitable axiom halting the regress. Yet under PJ₂, it collapses into infinite loop, demonstrating the principle's self-defeating nature. Gödel's incompleteness theorems (1931) parallel this: a consistent system cannot prove its own consistency without self-reference, yielding undecidability rather than proof. Justification demands derivation, not mere consistency; the Cogito provides the former's illusion but the latter's trap.

**The Cogito Chain Under PJ₂**:
- **Cogito**: ""I think, therefore I am."" (P = existence justified by thinking)  
- **R(P, PJ₂)**: ""Reason the thinking"" (demanding justification for the act of thinking)  
- **Response**: ""Because I think"" (tautology: thinking justifies itself)  
- **R(R(P, PJ₂))** = ""Reason the thinking"" again → Infinite loop: ""Because I think"" → ""Reason the thinking?"" → **∞**

**Absurdity**: The Cogito, intended as self-evident, becomes **circular self-reference** under PJ₂. Thinking cannot ground thinking without begging the question—reason demands justification for its own precondition, creating a **vicious circle** that mocks closure. This is the **absurdity of PJ₂**: it exposes even the most indubitable axiom as contingent, turning certainty's bedrock into a Möbius strip.

**Undecidability**: Mathematically, this is **diagonalization** (Gödel, 1931): R(Cogito) = R(R(Cogito)) → **⊥** (undefined, as no external ground exists). The Cogito is **undecidable under PJ₂**—neither provable nor disprovable without assuming what it proves. It violates PJ₂'s linearity, collapsing into **⊥**. Like Gödel's second theorem, consistency is asserted but unprovable; R demands the proof, which loops eternally.

**Implication**: PJ₂'s demand for absolute closure renders even Descartes' foundation ungroundable, proving the theorem's reach: no axiom escapes regress. This is not a flaw in the Cogito but in PJ₂'s unrelenting logic—reason's internal standard, when absolute, devours itself. Psychologically, this loop manifests as existential dread (Yalom, 1980, *Existential Psychotherapy*); sociologically, as crises in foundational narratives (e.g., postmodern skepticism).

**Examples**:
- **Everyday Causal Why**: ""Why did my coffee spill?"" → ""Bump"" → ""Reason bump?"" → ""Muscle contraction"" → ""Reason muscles?"" → ""Biochemistry"" → ""Reason biochemistry?"" → ""Physics"" → ""Reason laws?"" → ""Reason reality?"" → No self-justifying halt → Chain infinite; P unjustified.  
- **Scientific Why**: ""Why does DNA replicate?"" → ""Base pairing"" → ""Reason pairing?"" → ""Quantum bonding"" → ""Reason quantum?"" → ""Reason fields?"" → ""Reason mathematics?"" → ""Reason logic?"" → No absolute foundation → Unwarranted.  
- **Practical Why**: ""Why pursue career X?"" → ""Stability"" → ""Reason stability?"" → ""Human flourishing"" → ""Reason flourishing?"" → ""Reason value?"" → ""Reason consciousness?"" → Infinite; decision unwarrantable.  
- **Sociological Why**: ""Why accept 'Water freezes at 0°C'?"" → Consensus → ""Reason consensus?"" → Social construction → ""Reason society?"" → Why(E) → Infinite; cultural norms unjustified.

Under PJ₂, justification is **universal and unrelenting**, upholding epistemology as an active process—**truth vs. belief is maintained** through warrant-chaining. However, the infinite regress at ultimate levels collapses certainty: no proposition achieves absolute warrant, but the process persists, distinguishing it from PJ₁'s collapse into inert belief.

## 3. The Reason Operator: From Epistemology to Mathematics

### 3.1. Epistemological Definition and Role

In epistemology, **R** is a **chain operator** on justification, commanding warrant at every step:

> **R(P) = the derivation that grounds P**  
> **R²(P) = R(R(P))**  
> **Rⁿ(P) = R(Rⁿ⁻¹(P))** for n ≥ 1  

It separates **truth** (warranted belief) from **mere belief** (unwarranted assertion), ensuring certainty through derivable chains. Under PJ₂, R is **mandatory**—stopping collapses epistemology into passive acceptance, where no active validation occurs, and truth dissolves into unexamined assumption. Psychologically, iterative R models rumination (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000); sociologically, it critiques institutionalized halts (Merton, 1973).

### 3.2. Mathematical Formalization

Let **L** be a formal system (e.g., Peano arithmetic or ZFC set theory). Let **Prop(L)** be propositions in **L**, **Proof(L, P)** derivations of **P**.

> **Definition 3.2.1 (Reason Operator in Logic)**  
> **R : Prop(L) × {PJ₁, PJ₂} → (Proof(L) ∪ {∞, ⊥})**  
> - **R(P, PJ₁) = D**, if D ∈ Proof(L, P) is sufficient (finite, pragmatic, or axiomatic halt).  
> - **R(P, PJ₂) = D**, if D is complete (self-grounding derivation); else **∞** (non-terminating chain) or **⊥** (undecidable via diagonalization).  

**Properties**:
- **Recursive**: **R(R(P)) = R²(P)**, extensible to **Rⁿ(P)**.  
- **Diagonal**: For self-referential P, **R(P) = Proof(¬Provable(P))** (Gödel, 1931), yielding **⊥** under PJ₂.  
- **Termination**: Finite under PJ₁; non-terminating (**∞**) under PJ₂ for non-self-grounding P.  
- **Monotonicity**: If **R(P) = ∞**, then **R(Q)** = ∞ for any Q derivable from P (regress propagation).

**Theorem 3.2.2 (Regress Propagation)**: In any consistent L, for ultimate whys W, **R(W, PJ₂) = ∞** implies **∀P ∈ Prop(L), R(P, PJ₂) = ∞** if P traces to W (e.g., via cosmological or self-referential embedding).

### 3.3. R in Mathematical Contexts

**Example 1: Gödel's Incompleteness**  
Let **G** = ""This sentence is unprovable in L.""  
**R(G, PJ₁) = diagonal construction** → Finite (sufficient proof of unprovability via encoding).  
**R(G, PJ₂) = R(Proof(¬Provable(G))) = R(Consistency(L))** → R(Consistency(L)?) → Infinite (Gödel's second theorem: consistency unprovable in L) → Epistemic collapse. Here, R exposes the system's self-referential limit: consistency is consistent but unprovable, mirroring PJ₂'s demand for derivation over assertion.

**Example 2: Halting Problem**  
Let **H(P, x)** = ""Does program P halt on input x?""  
**R(H, PJ₁/PJ₂) = Turing's diagonal reduction** → **⊥** (undecidable in any computable L) → Unwarranted at all levels; Rⁿ(H) escalates to meta-computability questions, yielding **∞**.

**Example 3: Continuum Hypothesis (CH)**  
**R(CH, PJ₁) = Gödel-Cohen independence in ZFC** → Sufficient (axiomatic halt via forcing).  
**R(CH, PJ₂) = R(ZFC axioms)** → R(set theory foundations?) → R(Why mathematics?) → Infinite → Unwarranted; axiom choice becomes arbitrary without self-grounding.

**Example 4: Axiom of Choice (AC)**  
**R(AC, PJ₁)**: Sufficient for theorems like Banach-Tarski.  
**R(AC, PJ₂)**: R(Why infinite sets behave thus?) → Cosmological embedding (Why(E)) → **∞**.

**R as Recursive Operator**:  
Under PJ₂, **Rⁿ(P) ≠ P** for all finite n → **Ascent to infinity** → **No foundation**. This formalizes the Münchhausen trilemma: regress (**∞**), circle (⊥ via self-reference), or halt (forbidden).

### 3.4. Extensions to Cognitive and Social Models

In cognitive models, R aligns with hierarchical Bayesian inference (Friston, 2010), where priors terminate at ""sufficient"" levels (PJ₁) but infinite regress under PJ₂ disrupts prediction error minimization. Sociologically, R critiques black-box acceptance in institutions (e.g., algorithmic governance; Zuboff, 2019, *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism*), urging derivable transparency.

---

## 4. Everyday Whys: Finite Under PJ₁, Infinite Under PJ₂

Everyday ""whys"" appear innocuous but reveal the principles' divergence, bridging individual psychology and societal norms.

### 4.1. Everyday Whys Under PJ₁

These terminate at sufficient grounds, supporting functional knowledge:

- **Causal**: ""Why did my coffee spill?"" → ""Bump"" → Sensory evidence → Halt (heuristic acceptance).  
- **Practical**: ""Why exercise?"" → ""Health benefits"" → Utility (e.g., longevity data) → Halt.  
- **Scientific**: ""Why does DNA replicate?"" → ""Base pairing"" → Empirical experiments → Halt.  
- **Sociological**: ""Why follow traffic laws?"" → Social contract → Consensus enforcement → Halt.

**Outcome**: **Finite chains** → **Provisional certainty** → No collapse. Epistemology is active but bounded, enabling psychological flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) and social cohesion.

### 4.2. Everyday Whys Under PJ₂

No halt suffices, exposing latent infinities:

- **Causal**: ""Why spill?"" → ""Bump"" → ""Reason bump?"" → ""Muscles"" → ""Biochemistry"" → ""Physics"" → ""Reason laws?"" → Why(E) → Infinite.  
- **Practical**: ""Why exercise?"" → ""Health"" → ""Biology"" → ""Evolution"" → ""Reason emergence?"" → Why(E) → Infinite.  
- **Scientific**: ""Why DNA?"" → ""Pairing"" → ""Quantum"" → ""Fields"" → ""Reason mathematics?"" → Why(M) → Infinite.  
- **Sociological**: ""Why traffic laws?"" → ""Contract"" → ""Reason society?"" → ""Human cooperation"" → ""Reason consciousness?"" → Why(I) → Infinite.

**Outcome**: **Universal infinite regress** → **Certainty annihilated** → **Epistemic void** → Logical and reasoning collapse. Psychologically, this fuels doubt cascades (Yalom, 1980); sociologically, it undermines institutional trust.

### 4.3. The Gap: Psychological Habit and Sociological Suppression

Humans default to PJ₁ via cognitive miserliness (Fiske & Taylor, 1991), accepting facts without R (e.g., ""Water freezes at 0°C"" ignores quantum mechanisms). Society reinforces this via education and media, prioritizing efficiency over depth (Postman, 1985, *Amusing Ourselves to Death*). Yet complexity lurks: full R reveals chains to ultimates, bridging everyday to existential inquiry.

---

## 5. No Man's Theorem: Construction and Proof

### 5.1. Construction from PJ₂

The **No Man's Theorem** is **explicitly built from PJ₂**, the epistemological principle rejecting ""sufficient"" brute forcing or social halts. PJ₂ treats ""Reason it?"" as a **logical operator for justification**, essential for distinguishing truth (warranted belief) from mere belief (unwarranted assertion). Justification is epistemology's **active process**, chaining derivations to achieve certainty. Under PJ₁, this process halts prematurely, collapsing certainty into provisional acceptance—**no active chain means no dynamic validation**, rendering epistemology non-existent as a living discipline. Truth and certainty vanish, leaving only static belief.

PJ₂ preserves epistemology's vitality but unmasks its limits: **R(PJ₂)** = infinite for ultimate whys, demanding closure without permitting it. The theorem proclaims:  
> **No Man's Theorem**: No conscious being—individual or collective—can ever fully answer any of the three ultimate whys under PJ₂, as R yields non-terminating regress.  

**Construction**:  
1. PJ₂ forbids arbitrary stops, empirical termini, or consensus halts.  
2. Reason operator requires complete warrant at every step.  
3. Ultimate whys embed no self-grounding level (linear, circular, or meta structures).  
4. Result: Infinite regress → **No derivable answer possible** → Theorem holds.  

This construction integrates Gödelian limits: systems consistent under PJ₂ cannot self-prove via R, yielding undecidability.

### 5.2. Detailed Proof

**Regress Lemma 5.2.1**: For any ultimate why W, under PJ₂: **R(W) = E₁ → R(E₁) = E₂ → …** with no self-justifying E_k (by definition of ultimacy) → **R(W) = ∞**.

**Proof by Contradiction**: Assume ∃ finite n s.t. **Rⁿ(W) = F** (self-grounding F). Then R(F) = F (tautological closure). But ultimacy implies F embeds self-reference or cosmological regress, yielding ⊥ (diagonal contradiction, Gödel 1931). Thus, no such n; **R(W) = ∞**.

**Proof by Levels** (Structural Embedding):
- **Why(E)**: Linear cosmological regress (theistic: God → Why God?; naturalist: Big Bang → Why singularity?) → **∞**.  
- **Why(I)**: Circular cognitive self-loop (curiosity → Why curiosity? → Why(E)) → ⊥ embedded in **∞**.  
- **Why(M)**: Meta self-reference (reflection → Why reflection? → Diagonal on Why(I)) → **⊥** propagating to **∞**.  

**Epistemic Collapse Corollary**: Infinite R = no terminal warrant → All P tracing to W unjustified → Certainty gone → Truth/belief indistinguishable → Epistemology dead (radical skepticism).  

**Psychological Extension**: Per Nolen-Hoeksema (2000), infinite R models abstract rumination, empirically testable via response styles questionnaire correlations with existential distress.

---

## 6. The Three Ultimate Whys: Detailed Analysis

The three ultimate whys form a triad of structural failure under PJ₂, analyzable via the ""rope analogy"": justification as an infinite causal rope, where R traces backward from end (query) to unattainable start (foundation). Why(E) is linear (endless unraveling); Why(I) circular (loop closure without progress); Why(M) doubled-circular (meta-twist amplifying chaos).

### 6.1. Why(E): The External Ultimate Why

**Question**: ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" (Leibniz, 1714).  

**Under PJ₁**: ""Big Bang + quantum fluctuations"" → Empirical data (CMB, Hubble expansion) → Halt (predictive sufficiency).  
**Under PJ₂**: ""Big Bang"" → ""Reason Big Bang?"" → ""Laws of physics"" → ""Reason laws?"" → ""Mathematical necessities?"" → ""Reason mathematics?"" → No self-grounding (why logic over illogic?) → **∞**.  

**Rope Analogy**: Linear rope—infinite length toward origin. R unravels endlessly; no start reachable. Cosmological arguments (Aquinas, 1274; Craig, 1979) halt at ""necessary being,"" but R demands ""Reason necessity?"" → Regress resumes.  

**Theorem Protection**: No Man's Theorem renders Why(E) unanswerable—linear regress prevents closure, embedding all physical P in **∞**.

### 6.2. Why(I): The Internal Ultimate Why

**Question**: ""Why did I ask why?"" (self-referential curiosity).  

**Under PJ₁**: ""Evolutionary adaptation for problem-solving"" → Utility (survival fitness) → Halt.  
**Under PJ₂**: ""Curiosity"" → ""Reason curiosity?"" → ""Cognitive architecture"" → ""Reason architecture?"" → Why(E) (why existence enables cognition?) → **∞**, with circular loop: asker must reason asking, presupposing ungrounded self.  

**Rope Analogy**: Circular rope—end ties to start, avoiding regress but yielding vicious circle. Consistency (I ask because I ask) but no proof (Gödel: unprovable self-consistency). R demands derivation, trapping in tautology. Psychologically, this fuels solipsistic loops (Yalom, 1980).  

**Theorem Protection**: Self-referential loop under PJ₂ makes Why(I) unanswerable—questioner cannot warrant questioning without assuming warrant.

### 6.3. Why(M): The Meta Ultimate Why

**Question**: ""Why does self-reflection exist?"" (Hofstadter, 1979, extended).  

**Under PJ₁**: ""Emergent from neural complexity"" → Sufficient (e.g., integrated information theory; Tononi, 2008) → Halt.  
**Under PJ₂**: ""Neural emergence"" → ""Reason neural?"" → ""Why consciousness?"" → Why(I) → ""Reason self-reference?"" → Diagonal on system (Why(M) questions Why(M)) → **⊥** propagating to **∞**.  

**Rope Analogy**: Doubled-circular rope—meta-twist (rope reflects on its own looping). Chaos amplifies: self-reference squares the circle, yielding undecidable spirals (Hofstadter's strange loops). R exposes reflection as consistent but unprovable precondition.  

**Theorem Protection**: Meta-regress under PJ₂ makes Why(M) unanswerable—self-reflection justifies itself viciously, devouring derivation.

### 6.4. Triadic Singularity

The whys interlink: Why(M) metas Why(I), which internals Why(E). Under PJ₂: **R(Why(M)) → R(Why(I)) → R(Why(E)) = ∞** → Self-consuming singularity: **R(R(R)) = R**.

---

## 7. The Collapse Principle: Logical, Reasoning, Phenomenological, and Neuroscientific Dimensions

The **Collapse Principle** is the **structural failure of R = ∞** or **⊥**: logic demands termination; finding none, it unravels, evoking reasoning collapse at psychological/philosophical levels and logical collapse at mathematical/logical levels. This is not abstract—it's **cognitively inevitable**, with sociological echoes in collective doubt.

### 7.1. Logical Collapse (Mathematical/Logical Level)

Under PJ₂, infinite R = **non-terminating proofs** → **undecidability** (Gödel, 1931; Turing, 1936).  
- **Mathematical**: R(AC) = ∞ → Axiom choice arbitrary (no warranted infinity).  
- **Logical**: R(Why(M)) = diagonal ⊥ → Self-reference ungrounded (Hofstadter, 1979).  

**Consequence**: Logic's foundations crumble; no absolute warrant. Extension: In quantum logic, R(Why wavefunction collapse?) → **∞**, limiting even probabilistic certainty.

### 7.2. Reasoning Collapse (Psychological/Philosophical Level)

Under PJ₂, infinite R = **non-terminating warrant** → **reasoning paralysis**.  
- **Psychological**: Rumination loops (Why(I)) → Cognitive overload, depression risk (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000).  
- **Philosophical**: PSR violated → Global skepticism (Hume, 1739); antinomies (Kant, 1781).  
- **Sociological**: Erodes trust in ""facts,"" fostering relativism (Latour, 1987).  

**Consequence**: Reasoning loses coherence; belief proliferates without warrant. Therapy: Mindfulness interrupts R-chains (Kabat-Zinn, 1990).

### 7.3. Phenomenological Description

- **Logical Failure**: Infinite regress violates reason's expectation (Kantian antinomies), evoking vertigo (Heidegger, 1929).  
- **Epistemic Void**: No warrant → Truth/belief blur → Ontological insecurity (Laing, 1960).  
- **Absurdity**: Why(M) evokes Camusian revolt (1942)—the mind questions its own questioning, birthing existential freedom.  
- **Rope Phenomenology**: Linear pull (Why(E)) exhausts; circular bind (Why(I)) frustrates; doubled twist (Why(M)) disorients.

### 7.4. Neuroscientific Explanation

Collapse is **neurobiologically inevitable** from **predictive failure** in hierarchical processing:  
- **Amygdala**: Detects uncertainty in infinite regress (LeDoux, 2000); R = ∞ = maximal threat → Hyperarousal, reasoning disruption.  
- **DMN**: Hyperactivates in self-referential loops (Why(I)/Why(M); Raichle, 2015), causing rumination → Default to mind-wandering overload.  
- **PFC**: Fails hierarchical reasoning abstraction (Badre & D'Esposito, 2009), evoking decision paralysis → Logical breakdown in dorsolateral PFC.  
- **Limbic-PFC Disconnect**: Amygdala-DMN dominance over PFC = **visceral reasoning failure** (Panksepp, 1998, SEEKING system frustrated).  

**Why Collapse Possible?** Evolution optimized for **pattern completion** (Friston, 2010; survival via finite predictions). **R = ∞** = **pattern annihilation** → Primal freeze/flight response, conserved from ancestral threat detection.  

**Empirical Proposal**: fMRI/EEG during guided R-chains: Predict amygdala-DMN coupling escalates with regress depth, correlating with subjective vertigo (Yalom scales). Sociological extension: Cultural variance in collapse tolerance (e.g., individualistic vs. collectivist societies; Markus & Kitayama, 1991).

---

## 8. Applications and Utility

### 8.1. Philosophical Applications

- **Metaphysics**: Why(E) undecidable → Theism/atheism as equipollent beliefs (no warranted priority; Schaffer, 2010).  
- **Logic**: Why(M) explains Gödel/Hofstadter strange loops as collapse sources, unifying self-reference pathologies.  
- **Ethics**: Why(I) justifies moral skepticism (values ungrounded); PJ₁ enables pragmatic virtue ethics (Aristotle, 350 BCE).  
- **Ontology**: Rope analogy reframes Heidegger's *Dasein* as meta-circular inquiry.

### 8.2. Scientific and Mathematical Applications

- **Physics**: R(Why laws?) = ∞ → Limits reductionism (e.g., string theory's ungrounded dimensions); justifies PJ₁ for empirical progress (Wigner, 1960, ""unreasonable effectiveness"").  
- **Mathematics**: R(AC) = ∞ → Guides axiom choice via meta-criteria (e.g., simplicity over absoluteness).  
- **Computer Science**: R(Halting) = ⊥ → Informs termination oracles in AI, preventing recursive traps.  
- **Biology**: R(Why evolution?) → Why(E) → Bounds teleology in origins of life.

### 8.3. AI Safety Applications

PJ₁-based termination conditions prevent recursive self-improvement loops (Bostrom, 2014, *Superintelligence*); PJ₂ warns of undecidable self-referential AI (e.g., Why(M) in goal alignment → ⊥). Utility: Embed R-limits in value functions for ""reflective stability"" without collapse.

### 8.4. Psychological, Sociological, and Therapeutic Utility

- **Diagnosis**: Explains rumination/depression as R-regress (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000); ontological anxiety as Why(M)-loops (Yalom, 1980).  
- **Therapy**: Switch to PJ₁ via CBT (reframe halts; Beck, 1979); embrace regress via existential therapy (accept absurdity; Camus, 1942). Posttraumatic growth via R-resilience (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004).  
- **Education**: Teach cognitive flexibility—PJ₁ for problem-solving, PJ₂ for critical thinking (Dewey, 1938); curricula on rope analogies for meta-cognition.  
- **Clinical**: Distinguish adaptive inquiry (finite R) from pathological rumination (infinite R); biomarkers via DMN-fMRI.  
- **Sociological**: Humans accept facts under PJ₁ (e.g., ""Water freezes at 0°C""), but complexity demands R—mechanisms (H₂O bonding), deeper chains (quantum entropy). Modern society suppresses R for efficiency, leading to ""shallow certainty"" and vulnerability (e.g., misinformation epidemics; Latour, 1987). Utility: R as tool for critical sociology, uncovering hidden assumptions in ""fact-culture"" (Berger & Luckmann, 1966); promotes ""justificatory publics"" for democratic deliberation.

**Overall Utility**: **Unified diagnostic tool**—reveals cognitive traps (individual), cultural biases (collective), enables pragmatic escape (PJ₁), illuminates reason's beauty in failure (PJ₂). In AI era, fosters hybrid human-AI inquiry with bounded R.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Cendipite's No Man's Theorem demonstrates that **R**, as a formal operator, unveils reason's boundaries—linear, circular, meta-circular. Under **PJ₁**, life thrives in provisional weave. Under **PJ₂**, **all chains infinite**—**certainty annihilated**, **epistemology collapsed** into void.

The three ultimate whys form a **self-consuming singularity**:  
> **R(R(R)) = R**  

Yet collapse births possibility: the rope's frayed end, looped absurdly, twisted meta, invites not despair but revolt—Camus's Sisyphus (1942), Nietzsche's eternal return (1883), resilient pattern-making amid annihilation. Psychologically, sociological, we learn: reason finite, but its pursuit infinite.

**Final Thought**:  
> *The mirror reflects itself. Why(M) = ⊥. The reflection has no reason—only the collapse of seeing, and the dawn of ungrounded sight.*

1p062hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1p062hb/am_i_wrong_for_feeling_like_my_girlfriend/,Am I wrong for feeling like my girlfriend catfished me?,"I 27M have been in a relationship for close to 10mo with 27F Ashley! Ashley is amazing and for the first time in my life I actually think (thought) she was the one.

Backstory: I’m currently living with 27F Anna, Anna and I had a rather traumatic upbringing that has formed out amazing dark sense of humour! Our parents (her dad and both of my parents) were big into drugs and partying, we were both born in hospital rooms next to each other on the same day and jumping forwards to when I was 4yo my dad was driving with me in the back of the car while drunk and crashed, he fled the scene not too be seen again and Anna’s mum (separated from her dad at this point) took me in and became my godmother. My mother ended popping back into the scene and we lived out of a car for most my childhood before she just dropped me off at my grandparents. 
Jumping forwards to two years ago we reconnected and on my birthday (same day as Anna) she k***ed herself (happy birthday too me) Anna and her family are very successful and take care of me beyond words can say, she recently moved in with me and she just works her ass off then sleeps. Since school our friendship group is a mix of male and females , we are all really close! 

When I started dating Ashley on our third or fourth date she asked me “what are your red flags or deal breakers in a relationship” and I said “if you don’t get along with my friends” (I can’t express how much all of my friends mean to me! They’re literally my family) 
Ashley agreed and I just knew we clicked. 

I’ve been on dates before and the girls immediately got weird when I mentioned I lived with a female, Anna honestly feels like a sister to me! I know a lot of guys say that but she’s the closest thing I have to it. 

When Ashley first started coming over admittedly I was asking Anna for a lot trying to impress Ashley, I was “borrowing her wine” and Anna even cooked a dinner I claimed to make (I can’t cook) this later ended up being a funny joke between Ashley and I as about two weeks after this I came clean! One night Ashley had gotten her period, I got up and asked Anna if she had anything laying around Ashley could use (Anna has severe issues with her ovaries and hasn’t had a period in three years) 
she said to me I needed to think about these things now that things were getting serious but Anna like the legend she is told Ashley to run a nice bath or have a shower and she’s pop out and get some. 
Honestly not growing up with any females Anna has blatantly sat me down and spoke to me about what he should have been told growing up, like having tampons or pads in the house is a good idea! I even went and got a heating pad for when Ashley has periods pains. Call me ignorant but this is honestly something I was never taught. Anna has given me all the tips and tricks on how to treat women right, even at a young age if I said something rude or out of line she had no hesitation to put me in my place and I’ve always appreciated it and taken notes.

Anna adores Ashley and one day Ashley was having a bad day and I unfortunately got a call into work I couldn’t decline, Anna asked Ashley if she wanted to go shopping with her or to a yoga class she had planned to distract her and Ashley agreed, they had a great day and more than anything it was nice to see a girlfriend get along with my friends (or so I thought) 

We had a group gathering with all of my close friends 6 guys and 5 girls, Ashley attended and this was not the first time hanging around my group of friends. The night was going well and I didn’t feel like I had to be around Ashley the whole night as Anna took her away to where the girls and a few guys were playing a drinking game. Later in the uber home Ashley wouldn’t speak to me, she was drunk and I assumed she just needed to be in bed, Anna had left earlier that night as she always does an Irish goodbye and tucks up early like the grandma she is. 

The next day Ashley wouldn’t speak to me, I probed and was trying to find out what was wrong! She continued “I’m fine” “nothings wrong” all those classic sayings when something is CLEARLY not fine. 

I gave up gave her a kiss on the forehead and jumped into the shower, when I got out she was in the lounge room, Anna had just gotten back from the gym and offered us both coffees! I said I’d love one and Ashley stormed off into the bedroom. I went in and probed again, she then admitted she hated Anna, and all of my female friends and Insisted Anna moved out. 
I felt faint, all of my female friends have been nothing but welcoming and have even taken her out for dinner multiple times and Ashley had come back from these occasions glowing and mentioning how much she loved my friends! Then this? 

I asked her if she’d been faking this whole time and she said “of course” and that she’s “sick of ME picking my female friends over her” I was absolutely gobsmacked
even after we clearly stated on our earlier mentioned date it was a deal breaker for both of us. I mentioned I felt a little bit catfished she flipped out and called me selfish.

Am I wrong for feeling this way??? Am I being selfish by saying I feel catfished? I really really like this girl! But I love all of my friends like family",5,1763452298.0,TwoHotTakes,17,0.67,False

So, she put me on a diet, as well as intermittent fasting - for 14 hours a day. And I've been exercising about 30 minutes to an hour every day, as per her orders. And she said no snacking as well, along with no drinking anything but water, except maybe tea or black coffee.

In the first week, I lost 7 pounds. I didn't weigh myself the second week, but just yesterday or so, I weighed myself again, and had now lost 17 pounds.

Online, I've seen it's recommended you only lose 1-2 pounds per week, but also that people with more fat may lose it faster in the beginning? So I'm not completely sure, and have therefore, come for advice 😅

1p060tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/demonhatstories/comments/1p060tw/chapter_22_body_check/,Chapter 22: Body Check,"Sue's towel clung damply to her skin as she padded into the bedroom. The air was warm, faintly perfumed with her lotion, and heavy with the kind of silence that made every small movement seem amplified. She reached for her clothes and perched on the edge of the bed—only to jolt upright as if an electric current had shot through her spine.

She had felt something.

Her fingers skimmed the curve of her backside, a quick brush over smooth skin, before she twisted in front of the mirror, contorting her body to catch a glimpse. Nothing. Not a blemish, not a wrinkle, not a trace. The reflection stared back at her: flawless, sculpted, the kind of perfection she had built her career upon. Still, she lingered, checking once more. *Was I imagining it?*

Her butt was impeccable. Of course it was. It had to be.

The city street outside blazed with heat and glamour as Sue strode along, every step purposeful. The world itself seemed brighter, louder, exaggerated, as though reality was turned up a notch when she entered it. People noticed her. They always did. And why wouldn't they? She was built to be seen.

Back in the dressing room, Sue slid into her leotard, tugging the fabric into place with the ritualistic precision of a soldier donning armor. Another glance in the mirror. Another assessment. Still impeccable. Still perfect.

Onstage, under the lights of the *Pump It Up* set, Sue's smile was wide and contagious, the kind of smile that sold energy drinks and exercise tapes. She greeted the crew, her warmth practiced yet convincing, before lining up at the center of the formation.

""Ready, Sue?"" the assistant director called.

She shot him her signature grin—teeth gleaming, eyes alive.""Ready!""

The countdown began. *Three… two… one…*

And then the cameras rolled, the lights blazed, and Sue became her television self: flawless, magnetic, the leader of the rhythm.""Hi everybody! I'm Sue and it's time to pump it up! Are you ready? LET'S GO!""

Music exploded through the speakers, bass thumping like a heartbeat. She moved effortlessly, hips snapping to the rhythm, dancers mirroring her precision.

*This is what I do. This is who I am. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.*

Until—

A flicker. A feeling. That same strange pull in her backside.

Her rhythm faltered. For a moment, she froze, her hand grazing her leotard-covered cheek. Nothing. No lump, no shift. And yet… she had felt it.

The room froze with her. Music cut. Cameras stopped. Crew stared.

""I… I thought that…"" she stammered, voice thin with confusion. Heat spread across her chest. Her hand pressed again, furtive, desperate. Nothing.

""Sorry,"" she managed. ""Something distracted me.""

The control room's voice came, calm, dismissive: *Not a problem. Reset. Again.*

But inside Sue's head, the words tangled. *Something's wrong. I know it. I felt it. Why can't I see it?*

They tried again. And again. Each time, Sue's polished routine cracked a little more under the weight of her own anxiety. Sweat clung to her temples. Her smile felt plastered, hollow. She could sense the eyes on her—not just the cameras, but the dancers, the crew, the audience that would eventually watch. Watching *her*. Watching her ass.

And then, when she bent forward—

*Schlurrrp.*

The sound was obscene, wet and wrong. A bulge pushed against her leotard, distorting the immaculate lines of her body. Panic exploded through her nerves. She jerked upright, nearly toppling, saved only by a dancer's reflexive catch.

Everyone stared. The silence was heavier this time, thicker, tinged with unease.

Sue's hand trembled as it reached back. Nothing. Again, nothing. *What the fuck is happening to me?*

""I skipped a step,"" she muttered, too quickly, too brightly, her laugh brittle. But nobody laughed with her.

The third attempt ended not with her mistake, but with the director's interruption. Something caught on camera. Something bizarre. They rewound the footage, replaying it frame by frame on the giant studio screen, until the truth loomed behind her in grotesque magnification: her ass, filling the screen, frozen on the moment of distortion.

Her cheeks burned hotter than the lights overhead. She tugged at her leotard, trying to cover, but the fabric betrayed her. No cut, no stitch would ever allow that flaw to be hidden.

""Can I have my dressing gown?"" she whispered, then snapped, ""GO GET IT!"" when her assistant hesitated.

She could hear the crew murmuring, the director calling time codes, the replay dragging her humiliation out second by second. Her perfect body, her perfect image, reduced to a punchline on a loop.

By the time the assistant returned, Sue's nerves were ragged, her hands shaking as she yanked on the robe and fled the stage. ""I need a five-minute break,"" she gasped, already halfway down the corridor.

But she knew—five minutes wouldn't be enough.

Not when she no longer trusted her own body.

The fluorescent lights hummed faintly above her as Sue hurried down the sterile backstage corridor, her footsteps tapping too fast and too loud, betraying the tension she carried in her chest. Every turn of the hallway seemed to press in on her, like the walls themselves knew her secret and wanted to close around it.

She slammed the dressing room door shut behind her and leaned against it, exhaling in sharp, shallow bursts. For a moment she didn't move, only stared at her reflection. Her own eyes, glassy and wild, stared back at her as though she were already a stranger to herself.

Slowly, with trembling hands, she tugged up the edge of her leotard. Her breath hitched. The bulge was back. Bigger. Uglier. A grotesque swelling deforming her skin, as though something alien were lodged beneath it, pressing to get out.

Her fingers hovered, hesitating—then touched it. A shiver shot down her spine. She could move it.

Biting her lip, she pressed harder, guiding the lump beneath her skin. It slid, sluggish and resistant, as if it had a mind of its own. A faint, wet suction followed it. She grimaced. Her stomach rolled with nausea, but she couldn't stop. The bulge traveled upward, dragging beneath the surface of her flesh toward her waist.

*What the hell is happening to me?*

A soft knock rattled the door.

""Sue? Do you want some coffee or something?"" The floor runner's voice was muffled, tentative.

She didn't answer. She didn't even hear him. Her entire focus was on the thing inside her. She guided it down, across her abdomen, forcing it toward her belly button.

And then she saw it.

The skin at the center of her navel began to stretch and distort. Something glistened in the tiny hollow—a tip, the end of something buried deeper. Heart hammering, she jammed two fingers inside, spreading the tender flesh apart. Her breath came ragged as she dug deeper, searching, desperate to seize hold.

When she finally gripped it, she pulled. Slowly, slickly, impossibly, an oblong shape began to slide free. Her stomach turned. The smell of grease hit her nose, heavy and nauseating.

She pulled harder.

It came out with a revolting suction, a greasy drumstick, roasted brown, dripping fat onto her trembling hands.

*This isn't real. This can't be real.*

Her belly button puckered shut with an obscene, sucking pop.

Sue screamed—

And bolted upright.

Darkness swallowed her. Her lungs dragged in gulps of hot, sticky air. She was back in the secret room, drenched in sweat, her hair clinging to her forehead. The matrix in stasis lay at the far end of the pipe, its pale body still as death.

Her hands clawed at her stomach, her hip, her backside. Smooth. Perfect. Impeccable. No bulges, no wounds, no horrors waiting beneath.

Just skin.

She shuddered. Her throat ached with the echo of her own scream. *What a mindfuck. A goddamn mindfuck.*

Her gaze drifted to Elisabeth sprawled on the floor nearby. Rage flared in her chest. She couldn't stop herself from glaring, her whole body trembling with a mix of terror and accusation.

**Please check the property on Google Maps first — many listings do NOT exist.**

Here’s what’s happening in Bangkok right now:

A lot of “too-good-to-be-true” hotel deals in the city center are actually **illegal daily rentals inside condominium buildings**. These listings are often created by **Chinese operators living outside Thailand**, who rent a condo on a 1-year contract, then secretly sublease it on Agoda, Airbnb, [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), etc.

This practice **violates Thai Hotel Laws**, and it’s extremely common at the moment.

# 🚫 These listings look like hotels — but they are NOT real hotels

They often use fake hotel names, stock photos, and misleading professional descriptions.  
When you paste the address into Google Maps, sometimes **the “hotel” doesn’t exist at all.**

# 🇹🇭 Important to know:

Any VAT or fees you pay **do NOT go to Thailand**, because these “properties” are not registered businesses.  
Thailand gets zero tax benefit — and guests get zero legal protection.

# ❗ What makes these illegal rentals obvious:

# 1️⃣ Night-time check-in only (after 8 PM)

This is purposeful — the operators want to avoid building management and security, who work office hours.  
A legit hotel **never** has a check-in policy like this.

# 2️⃣ Check-in via a lockbox

This is *not* common for hotels in Bangkok.  
Hotels have a staffed front desk — always.

A lockbox is a major red flag that the “hotel” is actually a private condo being rented illegally.

# 3️⃣ “Meet at a café nearby” instead of inside the building

Many guests report being told to:

>

It often feels sketchy — like you’re doing something wrong.  
Some people describe feeling like **a thief or a homeless person waiting for someone to sneak them in**.

This is because the operators cannot risk you entering the building alone and talking to management.

# 4️⃣ They sneak you through the side door or parking entrance

100% not how a legal hotel operates.

# 5️⃣ Building staff cannot help you if something goes wrong

Because — officially — you are *not supposed to be there.*

If:

* the AC breaks
* you get locked out
* there’s a safety issue
* you need emergency assistance

**No one in the building will take responsibility**.

# 🛑 Why you should avoid these listings

* They are illegal under Thai law
* You can be kicked out if building management catches you
* You won’t get hotel-level safety or service
* No reception, no staff, no housekeeping
* No insurance coverage
* No record with Thai immigration in case of emergencies
* No tax goes to Thailand
* You support an illegal shadow business exploiting condo owners and migrants

# 👍 How to protect yourself

✔ **Paste the hotel name into Google Maps** – does it exist?  
✔ **Check if the building is a HOTEL**, not a condo  
✔ **Read the check-in instructions** – lockbox = red flag  
✔ **Avoid listings with no reception**  
✔ **Avoid any listing asking you to check in at night**

If you really want to stay in a condo, book a **licensed serviced apartment** or a **legal hotel residence**.",0,1763451889.0,ThailandTourism,0,0.25,False

They read articles, watch videos, get inspired… and then Monday morning comes and they don’t know what to DO. Well, that ends today. I’m about to give you a week-by-week, day-by-day action plan that compresses what usually takes 12 months into 90 days. If you follow this system, you will land interviews. Period.

I just wanted to tell you about my student James. He was a business analyst at a mid-size company, frustrated with his role, dreaming about becoming a Scrum Master. For six months, he researched. Read articles. Watched YouTube videos. Bookmarked resources. But he never actually DID anything.

Then one day, his company announced layoffs. Suddenly, his “someday” career change became “right now or never.”

He reached out to me in a panic. I gave him the exact 90-day plan I’m about to share with you. Here’s what happened:

* Week 1: He passed his PSM I certification
* Week 4: He had his LinkedIn optimized and 30 Agile connections
* Week 6: He started volunteering with Code4Good
* Week 8: He applied to his first 25 jobs
* Week 10: He got his first interview
* Week 12: He had two job offers on the table

He chose a remote position paying $88,000 which is a 35% increase from his previous salary.

The difference? He finally had a SYSTEM. Not vague inspiration. Not “I’ll figure it out.” An actual step-by-step plan with weekly deliverables.

That’s what you’re getting today.

Let me break down the 90-day roadmap. I’m going to be realistic about timelines and what’s actually achievable. This plan assumes you can dedicate 10-15 hours per week to this transition. If you’re working full-time, you’ll need to extend this to 6 months, but the framework stays exactly the same.

# Days 1-30: Foundation Month

# Week 1: Knowledge Foundations

Your goal this week is to understand Scrum deeply enough to sound credible in conversations.

* Read the [Scrum Guide 3 times](https://www.whatisscrum.org/the-real-scrum-guide-2025/) (yes, THREE times, it’s only 13 pages and many interview questions test this directly)
* Read the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and 12 principles
* Take the [Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/) Open Assessment (this is your baseline)
* Set up your [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dejanmajkic/) with professional photo and optimized headline
* Join 5 LinkedIn Scrum groups (Scrum Masters Community has 90K+ members)
* Research and select your certification path: PSM I or CSM

# Week 2-3: Certification Pursuit

* If PSM I: Study 1-2 hours daily. Take the Open Assessment repeatedly until you’re scoring 90%+ consistently. Use free resources: Coursera’s “Introduction to Scrum Master Training” course, YouTube study guides, practice exams.
* If CSM: Enroll in a training course (they often run on weekends). The 16-hour training is mandatory but includes the exam prep you need.

Simultaneously:

* Connect with 20 Scrum Masters on LinkedIn using personalized messages (not generic connection requests)
* Identify 3 local Agile meetups happening in the next 60 days
* Read “[Essential Scrum” by Kenneth Rubin](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Scrum-Practical-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0137043295) (library or purchase)

# Week 4: Certification and Initial Outreach

* Take and PASS your certification exam (schedule it early in the week so you have time to retake if needed)
* Update LinkedIn IMMEDIATELY with certification badge
* Update your resume with certification prominently featured
* Apply to your first 5 jobs (this is practice for your application strategy, so don’t stress about rejections)
* Research volunteer opportunities: [Code4Good](https://code4good.org/#/) application at [volunteerconnection.redcross.org](http://volunteerconnection.redcross.org), Silicon Valley Project Management, local nonprofits…

# Deliverables by Day 30:

* ✓ Certification complete
* ✓ LinkedIn optimized with 25+ Agile connections
* ✓ First meetup attended
* ✓ Volunteer opportunity identified or applied to
* ✓ 5 job applications submitted

# Days 31-60: Experience and Network Building

# Week 5-6: Volunteer Work Begins

* Start your volunteer project (Code4Good, local nonprofit, or create your own project applying Scrum principles)
* Apply Scrum concepts in your CURRENT role: suggest a daily standup for your team, create a personal task board, propose a retrospective lunch to discuss improvements
* Attend your second Agile meetup (arrive 15 minutes early, stay 30 minutes late, meet 5+ people)
* Apply to 10-15 positions (2-3 per day)
* Read “Scrum: [The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time” by Jeff Sutherland](https://a.co/d/g3aACtj)
* Create a case study: Choose a real Scrum challenge (from volunteer work or hypothetical scenario) and write a detailed analysis of how you’d address it as a Scrum Master. Post this on LinkedIn.

# Week 7-8: Momentum Building

* Continue volunteer work. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING: sprint velocities, team improvements, challenges overcome, quantifiable outcomes. These become resume bullet points.
* Connect with 10 MORE experienced Scrum Masters on LinkedIn
* Apply to 10-15 additional positions
* Schedule 2 coffee chats (virtual or in-person) with Scrum Masters from your network. Ask about their journey, challenges, advice.
* Create your portfolio: Certification, volunteer work evidence, case study, Agile artifacts you’ve created (sprint boards, retrospective formats, etc.)
* Practice interview questions with a friend or mentor. Prepare 5 STAR method stories.
* Attend your third meetup or virtual Scrum event

# Deliverables by Day 60:

* ✓ Active volunteer experience with documented outcomes
* ✓ 35+ relevant LinkedIn connections
* ✓ 25-30 job applications total
* ✓ 2 informational interviews completed
* ✓ Portfolio created showcasing your work
* ✓ Interview practice completed with feedback

# Days 61-90: Application Intensity and Refinement

# Week 9-10: Application Push and Internal Opportunities

* If you’re currently employed: Request a meeting with your manager about an internal Scrum Master opportunity or piloting Scrum on one project
* Apply to 15-20 positions (increase volume while maintaining quality)
* Follow up on previous applications where appropriate (if it’s been 2+ weeks)
* Attend your fourth meetup (volunteer to help organize the next one. Why? Because this builds credibility fast)
* Share 3-4 LinkedIn posts about your learning journey, Scrum insights, or volunteer experience. Authentic stories resonate with recruiters.
* Complete 3 mock interviews (with mentor, career coach, or peer from meetup)
* Research companies known for hiring entry-level SMs and apply directly through their career pages

# Week 11-12: Persistence and Expansion

* Continue applications: 15-20 per week
* Expand to bridge roles if needed: Agile Coordinator, Project Coordinator, Team Lead positions that could transition to Scrum Master
* Request informational interviews with hiring managers at companies you’re interested in (LinkedIn makes this possible)
* Create a LinkedIn article about your career change journey. Authentic stories attract opportunities.
* Consider contract or part-time Scrum Master roles for experience (they often convert to full-time)
* Reflect on interview feedback and adjust your approach
* Celebrate small wins: interviews, callbacks, positive responses

# Week 13: Assessment and Continuation

* Review your metrics: applications submitted, interviews completed, networking connections made
* Analyze what’s working: which applications are getting responses? Which approaches generate interviews?
* Adjust your strategy based on data
* If offers received: Evaluate and negotiate (don’t accept the first offer without negotiating, Scrum Masters who negotiate earn 10-15% more)
* If no offers yet: Recognize this is NORMAL. Most career changers land roles between months 3-12. Recommit to the next 90 days with your refined approach.

# Deliverables by Day 90:

* ✓ 50-75 total applications submitted
* ✓ Multiple interviews completed (aim for at least 5)
* ✓ Robust LinkedIn presence with 50+ connections
* ✓ Ongoing volunteer work with quantified results
* ✓ Internal opportunity explored (if applicable)
* ✓ Clear understanding of job market and your positioning

# The Reality Check Tool: Are You on Track?

Even without a job offer at 90 days, you’re SUCCEEDING if you have these elements:

* ✓ Certification obtained
* ✓ Real Scrum Master experience (volunteer or workplace)
* ✓ 50+ quality applications submitted
* ✓ 5-10 interviews completed
* ✓ Strong LinkedIn presence with 50+ connections
* ✓ Active network attending meetups
* ✓ Clear understanding of what employers want
* ✓ Interview skills improving with each conversation
* ✓ Mental resilience despite rejections

If you have these at 90 days, you’re on track. Most career changers land their first role between months 3-12 depending on market conditions.

# The Application Tracking Tool

Create a spreadsheet with these columns:

* Date Applied
* Company Name
* Position Title
* Application Source (LinkedIn, company site, referral)
* Status (Applied, Phone Screen, Interview, Rejected, Offer)
* Follow-up Date
* Notes (what went well, what to improve)

Review this weekly. If you’re not getting interviews after 30 applications, something is wrong. Either your resume isn’t getting past ATS systems, or your application materials need refinement. Adjust accordingly.

# What Companies Actually Want in 2026

Let me decode job postings for you:

“2-3 years experience required” often actually means “demonstrate you understand Scrum and can facilitate teams.” Your volunteer work + certification + transferable skills satisfy this.

“Bachelor’s degree required” appears in many postings but isn’t universally enforced. Many accept equivalent experience or certifications.

The industries most open to entry-level career changers:

* Healthcare (operations and patient care backgrounds)
* Finance (business analysts and project coordinators)
* Education ([teachers](https://www.whatisscrum.org/become-an-innovative-educator/) with facilitation skills)
* Government (operations and program management)
* Manufacturing (process improvement backgrounds)

Remote positions remain abundant: 5,000+ on LinkedIn, 334+ on Indeed. Many companies now accept fully remote Scrum Masters, though some have location restrictions for tax reasons.

Here’s what separates people who succeed from people who give up:

>

You now have the system. The 90-day plan. Week by week. Day by day.

But here’s the truth: most people will read this, feel inspired, and then… do nothing. Or they’ll start strong and quit after the first month because they don’t see immediate results.

Don’t be that person.

# Your Next Steps:

**Action Step 1:** Print or save this 90-day plan. Put it somewhere you’ll see it daily. Cross off each week as you complete it.

**Action Step 2:** Start THIS WEEK with Week 1 actions. Don’t wait for the “perfect time.” Monday morning, read the Scrum Guide. Tuesday, set up your LinkedIn. Wednesday, take the Open Assessment. Build momentum immediately.

**Action Step 3:** For the complete system with ALL the templates, scripts, resume examples, LinkedIn profiles, interview question databases, and weekly check-ins that keep you accountable, check out my [**Scrum Career Compass course**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/scrum-career-compass/).

I’ve taken everything from this guide and turned it into a step-by-step program with video walkthroughs, downloadable templates, and community support. Hundreds of career changers have used this exact system to land their first Scrum Master role.

Visit the link in the description.

# Final Thought:

Every experienced Scrum Master was once exactly where you are now, certified but inexperienced, uncertain but determined, facing rejections but persisting.

The difference between those who succeeded and those who gave up wasn’t talent or luck. It was persistence paired with strategic effort.

Your first Scrum Master role awaits. It won’t find you, you must find it through the proven pathways I’ve shown you.

72.6% of current Scrum Masters successfully transitioned from other careers. You’re not pioneering, you’re joining a proven path.

The Scrum Master community welcomes career changers who bring passion, fresh perspective, and commitment to continuous learning.

Welcome to the journey, and future welcome to the profession.

Now go execute Week 1. I’ll see you on the other side.

1p05uh4,https://i.redd.it/m1yjn5ygyy1g1.jpeg,Private Budgeting App for iOS,"

Hi everyone!

A few months ago I launched my first app, a budgeting app I built to help me manage my spending. Since then, I’ve learned a lot from user feedback and from studying user experience. Today my update was approved, and it brings a few improvements that make the app feel much better to use.

The biggest change is a new semi-automatic transaction logging system (no bank connection needed). When I originally built it, I planned to use something like Plaid for transaction imports, but I soon realized that most people, myself included, aren't willing to give a small app access to their banking information. That stalled progress for a while, until I got the idea to use Apple Shortcuts instead. 

There are a couple of ways Shortcuts can be used, and Apple Wallet automations are the biggest one. They can send purchase info to the app right after an Apple Pay transaction. All you do is choose which budget the transaction belongs to (if any), and the shortcut logs the name and amount. There are no bank connections involved, and everything is logged using information from your own device.

Another main update is the way budget entries are organized. Before, the ""expense groups"" system required creating a group before logging anything. Now, that system is replaced with tags and views. Multiple tags can be assigned to the same entry, so you can view expenses in different ways. For example, you might have tags like ""House"" and ""Car"" for one view, then use ""Needs/Wants/Savings"" to look at the same expenses from another angle.

The app currently has a monthly subscription of $3.99, a yearly subscription of $22.99 and a lifetime purchase of $34.99. 

I'm actively improving it and have a few updates planned in the near future. If you give it a try, I'd love to hear what works well and what could be better!

1p05u6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SirLoinstakes/comments/1p05u6g/ch_ix/,Ch IX,"She immediately laid her head on his shoulder
and snuggled into him a bit.  He felt her inhale deep, the movement of her full breasts shifting up against his ribs.  She whispered out in the sight that followed “now I feel safe.” 

He couldn’t disagree that this closeness felt inherently right.  What the fuck was he getting himself into though? This was alien territory for him.  He was deep in thought when he noticed her breathing had leveled out and her whole body had relaxed. She was clearly sound asleep.
He figured, *fuck it, might as well doze a bit too* 

Eochu awoke with the first shaft of sunlight through the cracks in the window shutters.  To be honest he’d slept pretty lite.  Their fire had burned down to simmering coals in the night but the cabin held its heat pretty well and the weather had been mild lately.

With the first light pouring in he looked down to see Aisling still curled up against his side with her head on his shoulder, one arm draped across his chest and one of her legs draped over his thigh.  Her dress had bunched up near her hips in the night, there was a fair bit of bare legs on display.  From this position there was also good view down the valley of that plunging neckline with what looked like acres of ivory white skin covering soft mounds.   He was in no hurry to abandon the view, but the morning wood he found himself sporting was unlikely to go down either.  Eochu carefully extricated himself without disturbing her much and slipped outside to take a leak.  He leaned against the far outside wall and had to hold his cock down to keep it from sending a stream 4 foot in the air.  

Eochu walked down to the stream and splashed some water on his face before heading back in.
He added some wood to the fire and stoked it back to life.  He fixed another pot of coffee and dug out a couple more biscuits, making sure to set the honey out for her.

Over on the bed she began to stir.  She squirmed and stretched, those long dark eyelashes began to flutter then boom, those deep green eyes were open and looking his way.

Just the other day, he’d thought cresting a ridge as dawn breaks over a valley was as good a sight as a man could see.  He realized now that he’d been wrong.  Watching her wake up was even better.

He stepped over to the coffee pot and poured a cup for each of them.  She made her way to the table and he met her there with her cup.  He motioned at the biscuits and honey and said “help yourself.” 

As she sipped and nibbled he told her “it’ll be an all day trip to the nearest little village even if I ride hard.  We need provisions.  There’s no way I can make it back by dark, too much ground to cover.  I’ll leave my good antler handled knife here with you, I’ve got a small spare.  I expect to be back before the moon crosses the mid point in the sky.  You should be safe enough here till then.  It’s not the easiest place to find and not many still alive know of it.” 

She nodded and in that soft way of hers said “I understand. Please return to me.” 

That was all the motivation he needed.  In minutes he was dressed and out the door, hatchet on his hip, bow across his back and saddle in hand.

With a whistle the big red stud came trotting up from where he’d been grazing.  With the swiftness from years of repetition Eochu saddled the stallion and swung aboard. 
They left the clearing at a long lope with Aisling leaning against the doorway watching them go.

Eochu and the red stud rode hard for the nearest village. It hadn’t been much to speak of last time he’d been there and he hoped it hadn’t declined too much.  He could get by with the basics, he just hadn’t been prepared for female company.  
By mid day they’d broke out of the woods, the big red stud was eating up ground at this pace and showed no signs of struggling.

They crossed open ground and soon cultivated fields appeared.  The first signs of civilization, before the collection of low slung wooden buildings came into view.
Eochu let the sorrel horse ease up and then checked him to a walk.  He’d worked up a lather and it’d be good for him to cool down.  

They rode straight to the little building that housed what passed for a mercantile here.  
Eochu stepped off at the hitching post and flicked his reigns over it, then paused to loosen the cinch on his saddle.

He stepped up and inside.  There was an old grey headed woman behind the counter eyeing him suspiciously so he said aloud “I’m in need of some provisions.” 

Her expression shifted a little and she said “what can I get for you?” 

“Coffee, flour, beans, salt.  Maybe some sugar if you’ve got it.”  

She shuffled around pulling items from shelves and cabinets and said over her shoulder “we’ve got all that, how much you need?”  

He replied “enough to last two grown folk a couple weeks would be good.” 

She began bagging up items in a woven sack, and asked “Anything else?”

He thought for a second, “A pair of women’s shoes, and some vegetables?”

The old lady turned back around and eyed him again but with a little curiosity this time.  She replied “for vegetables there is a house down on the on right with a big garden they’ll sell you a few.” Then she said “We don’t have a real cobbler or garment shop here, just not big enough.  But I keep some necessities put back.  What size you need?”

Eochu held his hands out to her and motioned the shape as he recalled it and said “about that size.”

The old lady broke into a chuckle at that and waddled off to dig through some crates.
She returned with one and sure enough it had a pair of soft soled slippers with blue ribbons for laces in just about the size he’d indicated.
They were resting atop a pile of white fabric with lace accents.  He asked her what that was. 
The old lady said the Inn keeper had ordered it for the milk maid but he’d never come to pick it up.  The old lady suspected his wife had found out and the dress damn sure would fit that little shrew of a woman.  So she’d just held onto it.

With a smile the big woodsman said “bag ‘em both up and  give me a tally.” 

She bagged up his goods and gave him a figure.  He reached in his money belt and handed over the appropriate number of gold coins.  

The old lady said “I’ll give you a free tip, couple dangerous lookin fellers came through nosing around asking about a brunnette woman that wasn’t local.  They wore grey capes with the symbol of a raven’s head sewn on em” 

He set another gold coin on the counter as he collected his bags to head out and said over his shoulder as he left “good deeds should be rewarded.”

Outside he strapped the bags to the back of the saddle and headed off in the direction the old woman had indicated on foot with the stallion following behind.

He spotted the big garden soon enough, right where she’d said but what really caught his eye was the teen boy working with a little bay mare in the corral just beside it.  Eochu paused to watch.  The boy had her saddled and was exercising her some.  He was doing things right, she was loping around smooth and pretty.  It made Eochu think back to all the time he’d spent working horses as a young stable hand.

He called out to the boy.  “Nice little mare ya got there.”

“Thanks mister, she is a good one.  Gentle and smart.  She don’t need much working but it ain’t much trouble and I like to watch her move.” 

Eochu said “she for sale?”

The boy thought a second and then “heck mister, nearly everything around here’s for sale if the truth be told.  But I wouldn’t part with this little mare for cheap.”  

Eochu said “well really I came for vegetables” as he walked over to his saddle bag and dug down in the bottom under a hidden flap.  He pulled out a pouch with pretty good weight to it. 

The boy was still watching the pretty little bay mare and said “there’s vegetables bagged up on the corner of the porch there” as he turned towards Eochu to point out the bags.

The big woodsman tossed the kid the pouch just then.  The boy caught it and it clinked in his hands.  His eyes went wide.

Eochu said “that should cover it, don’t ya think?”

The boy stammered “heck mister, for that much you can have the mare, the saddle and all the vegetables you can load up!” 

Eochu walked to the porch and grabbed up a bag of vegetables.  The boy met him at the gate leading the pretty little bay mare.
Eochu tied her lead rope with some slack to the saddle on the red stud who snickered and nuzzled at her immediately.  Both the boy and Eochu grinned at that.

The big woodsman tightened his cinch and swung into the saddle on the sorrel.  He said as he steered em around.  “You’re training them right boy & treating them well.  Keep it up” 

With that he nudged the big sorrel to pick up some speed back towards the cabin and the little bay mare fell right into step along side.

1p05o83,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1p05o83/unforgettable_18m_18f/,“Unforgettable” 18M & 18F,"Today marks 2 months since I fumbled the first girl to ever like me back. I am a freshman in college 18M who moved very far away from home to have a fresh start in life. I moved across the country from my best friends when I was 14, I never really fit in where I moved to so I turned to eating as my escape. I gained over 50 lbs freshman year and was fat pretty much all throughout high school. I’ve always had crushes and gotten instagrams/numbers etc but never went to homecoming or prom. Junior year I made a very good friend who I was very attracted to, so I asked her out and she said yes but she never knew when she was going to be free. She then proceeded to block me and never speak to me again. After this I moved away one last time senior year and instead of focusing on girls I was gonna make a friend group and lose weight for college, to which I succeeded. I went from 240 to 175 during my freshman year and I think I was and am still pretty attractive, the only think objectively wrong with me is that I’m 5,8. To get to the point I meet one of my Airbnb neighbors 21F when I am in another state for orientation over the summer and she’s very pretty, she was there because her sister was from out of state as well and the same age as me. I never actually saw her 18F until 2 days later at one of the meetings and she was even more attractive than her sister. However I didn’t really do anything because I was focused on getting dude friends and learning about the out of state college experience. Fast forward to when school actually starts and we have the same intro to liberal arts class together. I was gonna talk to her about us sharing the same Airbnb during the summer and my frequent knowledge of her hometown since I visited there a lot. However I chickened out, this happened a lot during high school as well, I would start to approach then I would just turn away very casually. I end up talking with her after class and we end up walking and talking together for almost an hour. She then turned 5x more attractive now that we share similar interests, I also get her instagram. She seemed to be one of those weird short haired girls in middle school who had a bit of a glow up but still had that weird kid energy, generational jackpot. 30 mins after we talk she starts a convo with me through instagram, a first for me. We share some more interests and I was typing out asking her for coffee for the weekend but i backspaced. I end up accidentally running into her later that day after I make a wrong turn on my way back from class. We talk for another hour and I found the perfect opportunity to ask her for coffee, and she said yes with no hesitation. Confirmed plans with a girl, this is something completely new for me and I was feeling things I’ve never have before mentally and physically (butterflies in the stomach are real). The day finally comes and she is early at the coffee place, we grab our drinks and talk for about an hour about ourselves. Pretty soon she mentions her little brother having a girlfriend and her finding it funny how he’s getting more dates than her. I ask her if she’s had any dates yet in college and she replies by asking isn’t this one right now. I say yes a little nervously which makes her relived, she then mentions how she thinks I’m cute. Fireworks in the brain, growing up chubby and never really liked by girls, I could never imagine what it would feel like to receive a compliment like that. The date goes for about 5 hours, and she agrees to a second date and we end in a nice hug. Later that night she suggests instead of a dinner date the next weekend, we should watch a movie at my dorm to save some money. At the time I don’t think of it and we both like movies so I agree without a second thought. Monday: she feels a little sick from the weekend so we just exchange snaps all day with subtle flirting, another new venture for me sine every compliment I get feels like a godsend. Tuesday: I run to the city to pick up some photos and an Ethernet cable but the target was closed due to an arrest. I go over to her area of campus to have dinner at the dining hall together, we hang out for another 3 hours filled with fun conversation and overall good vibes. Wednesday: I have to run to target to grab that Ethernet cable, and while I’m in the city I see a flower festival and a free bouquets market. I make a nice bouquet for her and surprise her after her class with university colored flowers. She seemed very appreciative of them and took care of them later that night. At my photography class my teacher said I take too many pictures of buildings so I think of taking a picture of those flowers I got her and ask if I can come over sometime and snap a few pics for class since the flowers are very pretty. Thursday, September 18: after my class I walk to her building with her and meet her roommate 18F, who is coincidentally one of my best college friend’s hometown friend. I was only supposed to stay for about 15 mins since she had a lot of homework to do and I had to take care of my laundry. However after I take the photos she suggests going to a dorm party downstairs with Mario kart and I say yes because it sounds very fun. We have a great time and eventually she says she’s a bit hungry and suggests going back to her dorm for snacks. Also she takes a selfie of me and her together, which to me symbolizes that I’m someone she’s not afraid to show others. When we get to her dorm she doesn’t appear to have too many snacks so I joke about that. She replies “that’s because I took you here to makeout”. 😳. My mind is racing and for some insanely stupid reason I rant scared and stuttery how I’ve never even held hands let alone kiss. But I don’t waste too much time and our lips touch, she moves her lips but I don’t move mine. For me it was wonderful but I stop after a few seconds to do a double take. However she suggests trying it again on our second movie date which was tomorrow. I was extremely scared, I apologize for my inexperience and make the stupid stupid decision to ask about labels since we were going on a second date. She reassures me and calms me down but we go back to the party for about 30 mins and she escorts me out after us hugging. 10:30 in the dark part of the campus and I have just the worst feeling about how I may have ruined everything. My fears were true when i get the text I’ve heard too many times in my life…”Hey, im so sorry, but i just dont think this is going to work out. I still completely want to be friends and dont want it to be awkward, but im not ready for a relationship right now. I hope you understand.” I’m broken, I failed miserably for years to get a date and when I finally have a girl like me back I fumble at the goal line. She made the first moves pretty much from the start and now she drops this on me. My best friend from back home got this very same text from his now girlfriend so I thought I could save this by basically pouring my heart out. She doesn’t budge. The next morning I have a huge pain in my chest nothing could fix, I couldn’t eat, and I had to go to class with her in it in 30 mins. Class goes by and I tried to talk to her afterwards to ask what really went wrong and at that point I would have been fine with being friends since I genuinely enjoyed her company. She angrily says “I don’t want to talk dude”. After that day I really have not been the same person. In the 2 months since then, every weekend I have a high expectation to meet some new girl so I can forget about her, but rejection is very common for me, so I took up drinking. I’ve gotten alc poisoning 3 times since then. My friends didn’t want me around. I dream about her constantly in the most vivid ways, I check my phone when I wake up that’s how real they feel. I get easily distracted in class just daydreaming about the best week of my life. Everything reminds me of her. I see happy couples every corner since it’s college and I’m surrounded by beautiful girls I have no confidence to approach. For the last few lectures of the course, I drank a few vodka shots so I can actually enjoy myself being in the same room as her. The last class was this past Friday and she had to present. This was the first time I’ve seen her other than my peripheral in over a month and just the sight of her and her voice made me leave the room to cry in the bathroom. I’m very behind on my course work, I miss my hometown friends tremendously, and I can’t get another date to save my life. Even still over 8 weeks later I cannot forget the first one to ever like me back. Any suggestions on what I should do to move on and increase sober confidence?

1p05o1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyGut/comments/1p05o1u/dr_barbara_neilss_remedy_for_chronic_constipation/,"Dr. Barbara Neils's Remedy for Chronic Constipation: Herbal Colon Tea, Chia Seed Gel, and Castor Oil Compresses","If you’ve been struggling with chronic constipation despite exercising, drinking plenty of water, and following a vegetarian diet, Dr. Barbara Neils's remedy might offer the relief you’re looking for.

This holistic approach incorporates herbal colon tea, chia seed gel, and castor oil compresses to stimulate bowel movements and improve overall colon health. Let’s delve into each component and understand how they can help alleviate constipation.

**Why Am I Still Constipated?**

Even with a healthy lifestyle, chronic constipation can persist due to various reasons, such as a lazy colon, inadequate fiber intake, or an imbalance in gut bacteria. Dr. Neils suggests a multi-faceted approach to address these underlying issues effectively.

**1. Castor Oil Packs (Castor Compresses Over Colon)**

**How They Work:** Castor oil packs are applied over the colon area to stimulate bowel movements and reduce inflammation. The packs are made by soaking a cloth in castor oil and placing it on your abdomen, covering it with a plastic wrap, and applying heat.

**Benefits:**

* **Stimulates Peristalsis**: Castor oil is known for its ability to stimulate the smooth muscles of the intestines, promoting peristalsis, which helps move stool through the colon.
* **Reduces Inflammation**: The anti-inflammatory properties of castor oil can help soothe an irritated gut.
* **Detoxifies the Colon**: Regular use of castor oil packs can assist in detoxifying the colon by drawing out toxins and waste products.

**How to Use:**

* Soak a piece of flannel or cotton cloth in castor oil.
* Place the cloth over your abdomen, focusing on the colon area.
* Cover with plastic wrap and apply a heating pad or hot water bottle on top.
* Leave it on for about an hour while you relax.

**2. Chia Seed Gel**

**How It Works:** Chia seeds are hydrophilic, meaning they can absorb a significant amount of water, creating a gel-like substance. This gel can help hydrate the colon and facilitate smoother bowel movements.

**Benefits:**

* **Hydration**: Chia seeds absorb up to 25 times their weight in water, helping to keep the colon hydrated and easing the passage of stool.
* **Fiber-Rich**: Chia seeds are high in soluble fiber, which adds bulk to the stool and promotes regularity.
* **Nutrient-Dense**: They are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and various micronutrients that support overall gut health.

**How to Prepare and Use:**

* Place about half an inch of chia seeds at the bottom of an 8 oz jar.
* Fill the jar with water and shake for about 5 minutes until a gel forms.
* You can pour this gel over your food in the morning or drink half a cup if you have a very stubborn colon.

**3. Colon Tea (Herbal Tea Blend)**

**How It Works:** Dr. Neils recommends a specific blend of herbs for colon health, including cascara sagrada, licorice root, and buckthorn. This herbal tea helps stimulate the colon and promote regular bowel movements.

**Benefits:**

* **Cascara Sagrada**: Known as a natural laxative, it stimulates the muscles of the colon.
* **Licorice Root**: Has anti-inflammatory properties and helps soothe the digestive tract.
* **Buckthorn**: Acts as a mild laxative and promotes the overall health of the colon.

**Recipe and Dosage:**

* Mix 1 part cascara sagrada, 2 parts licorice root, and 3 parts buckthorn.
* Take 1 tablespoon of this dried herb mixture and add it to 1 cup of water.
* Simmer gently for 10 minutes.
* The tea will look like coffee but doesn’t taste like it.

**Dosage Recommendations:**

* If you have regular bowel movements (2-3 times a day): No need for the tea.
* If you have a bowel movement once a day: Maybe half a cup of tea.
* If you have a bowel movement every 2 days: 1 cup of tea.
* If you have a bowel movement every 3 days: 1 cup in the morning and 1 cup in the middle of the day.

The dosage depends on your colon’s needs, so adjust accordingly.

# What to expect with long term use of this colon detox tea

These herbs gently stimulate and revive colon function!

For chronic constipation, if you take 3 cups a day long term, say 6 weeks, you might even see your frequency of going to toilet increase to like 4 times a day. Therein you need to listen to your body, and reduce to 2 cups a day.

 

And keep listening to your body and most probably it will require to come down to 1 cup a day.

For severe chronic constipation, a combination of castor oil packs and this colon tea would be ideal solution!

In about 4-5 months or so, if you are still on 1 cup a day and going like twice daily, it might be time to cut this herbal tea and be off completely!

**Combining the Remedies**

For optimal results, consider integrating all three remedies into your routine:

* **Morning**: Start with a serving of chia seed gel over your breakfast.
* **Midday**: Apply a castor oil pack while you relax.
* **Morning/Afternoon/Evening**: Have a cup of colon tea, adjusting the amount based on your bowel movement frequency.

**Bottomline**

Dr. Barbara Neils's holistic remedy for chronic constipation combines the power of herbal colon tea, chia seed gel, and castor oil compresses to address the root causes of constipation. By stimulating bowel movements, hydrating the colon, and reducing inflammation, these remedies can help you achieve regularity and improve your overall digestive health.

Remember, consistency is key. Give these remedies a few weeks to see significant improvements. If you have persistent issues, consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1p05h5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1p05h5h/i_lost_the_love_of_my_life_and_blame_it_on_my/,I lost the love of my life and blame it on my unresolved trauma,"I just need to get this out somewhere because it has been sitting in my head for way too long.

There’s someone from my past that I still think about almost every day. I miss her a lot and I genuinely love her. It isn’t some toxic kind of love or anything dramatic. It’s just a deep, real kind of love that stayed with me even though she isn’t in my life anymore. I respect her space, and I’m not trying to reach out or overstep. I’m giving her the space she wants, and honestly I can’t put these heavy emotions on her anyway. That wouldn’t be fair to her, and I did that for a while. If I did that now, I’d just be doing the same thing again and it would mean I haven’t changed at all. But the truth is, I still care about her. I wish I could fly to her, talk to her, and tell her I love her, even though I know I can’t do that. It’s just the feeling that’s still there.

What also makes this harder is what she brought into my life. With her, everything felt calm. There was no aggression, no tension, nothing forced. Talking to her was easy. She made me feel understood in a way most people don’t. She had this steady and comforting energy that honestly felt rare to me. But I used my trauma as an excuse to not be honest and transparent with her. I avoided conversations, I held back, and I shut down instead of opening up. I know that played a part in why things fell apart, and I wish I hadn’t done that. She brought out a version of me that I really liked, and losing that connection has been painful even though I understand why things ended.

And even though a lot of time has passed, the feelings haven’t faded. Some days are lighter, but the longing is still there. I keep wondering when I’m finally going to stop feeling like this. I’m tired of being stuck on someone who isn’t coming back.

A lot of why it hits so deeply goes back to how I grew up. My childhood was rough. My dad was on meth, both my parents were alcoholics, and the whole environment was unstable. I never really had emotional support. I was suicidal in middle school, and in high school those feelings slowly faded away as I started pushing myself into parkour and other things. When I turned 18, I moved out because I didn’t want to live that kind of life or become anything like that. I never smoked, never drank, never did drugs. Even now the only thing I ever take in is caffeine. Coffee, Red Bull, Monsters. That’s it. I’ve always stayed far away from the addictions I grew up around. However, the feeling of dying sometimes seems appealing to me again, because it would be an easy way out instead of dealing with these feelings I have. 

Back then, all the pain and chaos weirdly gave me drive. It pushed me into parkour, freerunning, making videos, always training, always trying to prove something. I threw everything into the things I loved because it was the only time I felt in control.

Now it feels different. That spark just isn’t there the same way. I can enjoy something in the moment but the feeling never lasts. It doesn’t hit like it used to.

Honestly, the only times I really feel alive are when I’m doing adrenaline stuff. Downhill bombing on a longboard. Going fast on my electric board. Climbing something tall and sitting at the top thinking about life. Most people see that stuff as dangerous, but for me it’s one of the few things that actually makes me feel present.

I also used to get a lot of motivation from caring about someone in a relationship. Wanting to be better for them. That feeling pushed me in a good way. But right now, I don’t see myself with anyone for a long time. My heart is still too tied up in this situation. It’s hard to feel that drive anywhere else when you still love someone who is gone.

I just want to get to a point where I can genuinely move on. I want to put my energy back into myself and my life without this heavy feeling always sitting in the background. I want something to bring back that spark, even if it’s just a little bit. I’m not looking for some big life purpose. I just want something that makes me feel like I want to keep pushing forward.

I don’t want to rely on another person to give me that spark. I want to find it in myself. I just honestly don’t know how right now. The things that used to work don’t work anymore.

I’m not posting this to try to get her back or get advice on how to fix things. I’m not going to disrespect her space. I just want to understand how to finally move on when part of me still cares, still misses her, and still loves her.

If you read all of this, thank you. I really just needed to put it somewhere.

1p05gjy,https://i.redd.it/4vee2e3rty1g1.png,"I launched my side project: An AI study tool for finance certification exams in Singapore. Giving away 100% free access to the first 20 users for feedback! Pass the HI, M9A, M9 and RES5","Hey everyone,

I'm a local Singaporean coder and after months of work, I'm excited to share my side project, [Pass-Exams.com](http://Pass-Exams.com)

**TLDR:** CMFAS exams are brutal because the PDFs are static and don't teach you *why* you failed. My AI study app generates custom mini-lessons on the concept behind any missed question, while also being mobile-first, so you can study on your phone. Also multi-lingual support!

**The Offer: Use code PIONEER100 for a 100% discount. It’s limited to the first 20 users.**

**Grandpa Story:** I was going through the **#CMFAS #financialadvisor** exams and realized just how many times people retook \[and paid for retaking\] these exams, so I thought someone should come up with something better than just endless PDF mock exams that don't really teach you anything other than memorizing. From those who have taken the exams too, less than 20% of the mock exams ever come out and the questions are very tricky. I also programmed in translation for those where english is not their first language to make things more fair.

So I designed an AI-powered, **mobile-first web app** that helps you practice with high-quality mock exams. The key feature is the ""Deeper Dive"" button, which uses AI to generate a mini-lesson on the core concept behind any question. If this works I will test it on other exams too, like the PSLE. Currently right now I am focused on the CMFAS because mostly adults take it and they can report if something isn't working right. They're also mostly studying while also juggling work and family and can study on their commute home this way.

I live in **#yishun** so I used to study on the way to and from school, and I would get a solid 2 hours of extra study time because the commute was so long :D

We've just launched and are looking for beta testers/pioneers to help us improve and have a **100% off discount code**. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the platform, the AI features, or the overall user experience. I am hoping some current students sitting for the CMFAS will try it OR seasoned financial advisors who can see if the questions are tough enough.

This is the FIRST TIME I have posted, I know... but here's to being a lurker no more?

**PS: If you have a good idea and want to build something behind it, feel free to DM me. I am open to taking new projects on because I am bootstrapping, and am happy to get some coding assignments to pave the way. Let me know your budget and we can meet for coffee and a chat if you are located in #singapore.**",0,1763449905.0,singaporefi,0,0.14,False

Emma swirled the deep red wine in her glass, the liquid catching the soft glow from the string lights draped across Sophie's living room. 
The breakup had hit Sophie hard, her ex's betrayal leaving shadows under those warm brown eyes, but tonight, with the bottle half-empty between them on the couch, laughter bubbled up like the fizz in their earlier champagne. 
Emma's curvy frame sank deeper into the cushions, her green eyes flicking to Sophie's tall, lean body stretched out beside her. 
They'd been best friends since childhood, sleepovers and secrets their bond, but the alcohol warmed Emma's veins, making her skin tingle with something sharper than usual.

Sophie tipped her head back, exposing the long line of her throat as she laughed at Emma's terrible joke about bad dates.
 'You're such an idiot,' Sophie said, her voice husky from the wine, nudging Emma's thigh with her bare foot. 
The touch lingered a second too long, and Emma's breath hitched. 
She met Sophie's gaze, those brown eyes holding hers in the dim room, the air thickening with unspoken heat. 
Emma's heart pounded; she'd always buried the ache for more, the way her body responded to Sophie's nearness during tipsy nights.
But now, with Sophie vulnerable and close, the pull felt impossible to ignore.

They stumbled to the bedroom later, the world tilting from too many glasses, giggling as they stripped down to panties and tank tops. 
Sophie's bed was a mess of rumpled sheets, the scent of her vanilla lotion mixing with the faint tang of wine on their breaths. 
Emma slid under the covers first, her red hair fanning out on the pillow, watching Sophie climb in beside her. 
Their legs brushed, skin hot against skin, and neither pulled away. 'Night,' Sophie murmured, but her hand found Emma's under the blanket, fingers intertwining slowly.

Emma's pulse raced as Sophie's thumb stroked her palm, the simple touch sending sparks up her arm. 
She turned toward her friend, the darkness hiding the flush on her cheeks. Sophie's face was inches away, soft lips parted, eyes half-lidded.
 Emma's free hand moved without thought, tracing the curve of Sophie's hip over her tank top, feeling the warmth seep through the thin fabric. 
Sophie didn't stop her; instead, she shifted closer, her breath ghosting Emma's neck. The air hummed with tension, every inch between them shrinking.

Emboldened by the buzz in her blood, Emma's fingers slipped under the hem of Sophie's top, grazing the smooth, bare skin of her stomach.
 It quivered under her touch, and Sophie let out a soft gasp. Emma's green eyes locked on Sophie's, searching, but all she saw was hunger mirroring her own. She leaned in, lips brushing Sophie's collarbone, tasting the salt of her skin. 
Sophie's hand tightened on hers, guiding it higher, until Emma's palm cupped the swell of her breast, thumb circling the hardening nipple through the fabric.

'Emma...' Sophie's whisper was breathless, confused but laced with need. 
She arched into the touch, her own hand sliding down Emma's side, fingers digging into the soft curve of her ass. 
Emma peeled the tank top up, exposing Sophie's tits, full and heavy, nipples dark and peaked. 
She lowered her mouth, sucking one into her wet heat, tongue flicking hard against the bud. 
Sophie moaned low, her body trembling, legs parting instinctively as Emma's hand ventured lower, tracing the edge of her panties.

The fabric was damp already, Sophie's pussy soaking through as Emma's fingers pressed against her slit. 
She rubbed slow circles over the cotton, feeling the heat pulse beneath. 
Sophie bucked her hips, a whine escaping her lips. 'Fuck, that feels...' She trailed off, pulling Emma's face up for a kiss. messy, urgent, tongues sliding together in a drunken tangle. Emma tasted wine and want, her own cunt throbbing, slickness building between her thighs.

Sophie flipped them slightly, her taller frame pinning Emma gently as she yanked off both their tops. 
Naked from the waist up, their breasts pressed together, nipples scraping with every breath. 
Sophie's mouth trailed down Emma's neck, biting softly before latching onto her tit, sucking hard enough to make Emma cry out. 
‘Yes, Sophie, oh god,' Emma gasped, her hands in Sophie's dark hair. Sophie's fingers hooked into Emma's panties, tugging them down her curvy thighs, exposing her shaved pussy.

Emma spread her legs wider, inviting, as Sophie dipped lower. 
Her breath fanned over Emma's clit, hot and teasing, before her tongue flicked out, lapping at the wet folds. Emma's hips jerked, pleasure shooting through her core. Sophie ate her out with slow, deliberate strokes, tongue delving into her entrance, then circling the sensitive nub.
 'You taste so fucking good,' Sophie murmured against her, the vibration making Emma shudder. She sucked Emma's clit between her lips, fingers sliding in.. two at once, curling to hit that spot inside.

Emma's moans filled the room, raw and uncontrolled, her body arching as Sophie finger-fucked her steadily, thumb rubbing her clit. 
The alcohol blurred the edges, but the sensations sharpened everything. 
The wet sounds of Sophie's mouth, the stretch of her fingers, the ache building low in Emma's belly. 
She came hard, pussy clenching around Sophie's fingers, juices coating her hand as waves crashed over her.

But Sophie wasn't done. She crawled up, shedding her own panties, her trimmed bush dark against pale skin, pussy dripping. Straddling Emma's thigh, she ground down, slick folds sliding over skin. 
Emma reached up, fingers finding Sophie's entrance, plunging in deep. Sophie rode her hand, tits bouncing, moans breaking into gasps. 'Harder, Emma, fuck me,' she demanded, her bold side emerging through the haze.

Their bodies moved together, slick and urgent, Emma's thumb on Sophie's clit while Sophie leaned down to kiss her, muffling cries. Sweat slicked their skin, the bed creaking under the rhythm. 
Sophie's walls tightened, her orgasm hitting with a shuddering cry, cum soaking Emma's fingers. They collapsed, tangled and panting, hands still exploring lazily. 
Emma tracing Sophie's spine, Sophie nuzzling her neck.

Emma's body still hummed from her release, but the fire in her veins demanded more. 
Sophie's dark hair splayed across the pillow, her chest rising and falling in heavy pants, those warm brown eyes locked on Emma's with a mix of awe and raw hunger. 
The room smelled of sweat and sex, the sheets twisted around their legs like a promise of further surrender. 
Emma shifted, her curvy frame moving with drunken boldness, pushing Sophie flat on her back. 
Sophie's tall body yielded easily, her legs parting as Emma climbed over her, knees bracketing Sophie's ribs.

'Your turn to taste me again,' Emma whispered, her voice thick with need, green eyes flashing in the dim light.
 She inched up, her thighs trembling as she positioned her dripping pussy over Sophie's face. 
Her big, meaty clit throbbed, swollen and demanding, brushing against Sophie's soft lips.
Sophie didn't hesitate; her hands gripped Emma's ass, pulling her down firmly.
Emma gasped as Sophie's tongue darted out, lapping at the slick folds, tracing the length of her slit before zeroing in on that fat clit.

Sophie's mouth sealed around it, sucking hard, her lips pulling the sensitive nub into wet heat. 
Emma's hips bucked involuntarily, grinding down as pleasure spiked through her core. 'Fuck, Sophie, yes suck it like that,' Emma moaned, her hands bracing on the headboard, red hair cascading over her shoulders.
 Sophie's tongue flicked relentlessly, swirling around the clit while her teeth grazed it lightly, sending jolts straight to Emma's spine. 
The slurping sounds filled the air, obscene and intoxicating, mixed with Emma's whimpers and the creak of the bed.

Emboldened by the alcohol's haze and the night's unbridled freedom, Sophie slid one hand from Emma's ass to her inner thigh, fingers teasing the slick skin.
 Emma spread her legs wider, inviting the touch, her pussy clenching in anticipation.
 Sophie's fingertips brushed her entrance, gathering the fresh gush of arousal, then pressed in slowly..
one finger, then two, stretching the tight walls. Emma rocked against Sophie's face, her clit pulsing in the suction, while those fingers curled inside her, stroking the spongy spot that made her vision blur.

'More,' Emma begged, her voice breaking, body arching as Sophie added a third finger. 
The stretch burned deliciously, her pussy walls gripping the intrusion, juices coating Sophie's hand. 
Sophie hummed against Emma's clit, the vibration pushing her closer to the edge.
 She worked her fingers deeper, twisting them to open Emma up, her free hand kneading the soft flesh of Emma's thigh.
 Emma's breaths came in ragged gasps, her tits heaving, nipples hard points in the cool air. The confusion from earlier—their friendship, the breakup, the wine—faded into pure, urgent want.

Sophie's eyes met Emma's from below, dark with lust, as she tucked her thumb in and pushed forward. 
Her whole hand breached the slick entrance, knuckles slipping past the rim until her fist filled Emma's pussy completely.
 Emma cried out, a raw, guttural sound, her body shuddering violently at the impossible fullness. 
Sophie didn't move at first, letting Emma adjust, her mouth still latched onto the clit, sucking in steady pulls. 
Then she rocked her fist gently, the pressure grinding against every nerve inside.

'Oh god, Sophie it's too much, fuck, don't stop,' Emma sobbed, tears pricking her eyes from the intensity. 
Her hips ground down harder, riding Sophie's face and hand, the fist pumping in shallow thrusts now, stretching her wide. 
Sophie's tongue lashed the clit without mercy, teeth nipping as her arm flexed, driving deeper. 
Emma's inner muscles clamped down, the pressure building to a shattering peak. 
Sweat dripped from her brow, her curvy body quaking, every sense overwhelmed. 
The wet smack of Sophie's mouth, the obscene squelch of her fist in Emma's soaked pussy, the ache of her thighs from straddling so wide.

The orgasm hit like a storm, Emma's scream echoing off the walls as her pussy convulsed around the invading fist. 
Cum squirted out in hot spurts, soaking Sophie's chin and neck, her body seizing in violent waves. 
Sophie kept sucking, fingers of her other hand digging into Emma's ass to hold her steady, prolonging the release until Emma collapsed forward, trembling and spent. 
Slowly, Sophie withdrew her hand, the pop of her fist leaving Emma's pussy gaping and twitching, more juices leaking onto the sheets.

They tumbled together, Emma sliding off to curl against Sophie's side, both panting like they'd run a marathon. 
Sophie's arm wrapped around her, pulling her close, their sweat-slicked skin sticking. 
Emma's heart raced, not just from the climax but from the intimacy.
The way Sophie's lips brushed her forehead, tender amid the rawness. 
The room spun faintly from the wine, but the heat between them lingered, charged with unspoken questions. 
Sophie traced lazy circles on Emma's back, her breath evening out, while Emma replayed the feel of that fist inside her, the boldness in Sophie's eyes. 
Neither spoke, but the tangle of limbs felt like a new beginning, heavy with possibility as the night deepened around them.

Emma nestled deeper into Sophie's embrace, her curvy body molding against the taller woman's lean frame. 
The heat from their skin radiated like a shared secret, sweat cooling in the dim room as their breaths synced in ragged harmony. 
Sophie's arm tightened around her waist, fingers splaying possessively over the dip of Emma's hip, tracing the curve where ass met thigh. 
Emma's pussy still throbbed from the brutal stretch of Sophie's fist, a dull ache that pulsed with every heartbeat, reminding her of the raw invasion that had shattered her control. 
She buried her face in the crook of Sophie's neck, inhaling the musky scent of sex and wine-soaked skin, her red hair tangling with Sophie's dark strands.

Sophie shifted slightly, her soft lips brushing Emma's temple in a feather-light kiss that sent a shiver down Emma's spine. 
No words passed between them,
just the quiet press of bodies, legs entwined, Sophie's thigh slotted between Emma's, brushing against her sensitive folds. Emma's hand wandered lazily up Sophie's side, cupping the swell of her breast, thumb circling the hardened nipple absentmindedly. 
The touch was tender now, a contrast to the frenzy moments ago, but the undercurrent of lust simmered, making Emma's clit twitch faintly. 
She felt Sophie's heartbeat steady against her chest, the rise and fall lulling her, exhaustion from the alcohol and orgasm pulling her under.

'Mmm, stay like this,' Sophie murmured, her voice husky and low, warm breath tickling Emma's ear. 
Emma hummed in agreement, her green eyes fluttering shut as sleep crept in. Their bodies relaxed fully, limbs heavy and intertwined, the sheets a damp cocoon around them. 
The world outside faded. The breakup, the years of hidden glances, the 'just friends' facade all dissolved into this warm, sated tangle.
Emma's last conscious thought was the softness of Sophie's lips against her forehead, a promise unspoken as darkness claimed them both.

Morning light filtered through the half-drawn curtains, casting a golden haze over the rumpled bed. 
Emma stirred first, her body aching in the best ways, thighs sore from straddling, pussy tender and slick with remnants of last night's cum. 
She stretched languidly, her curvy frame arching against Sophie, who mumbled sleepily and pulled her closer. 
Their naked skin stuck slightly, breasts pressing together, nipples grazing in a spark of friction that made Emma's breath hitch. Sophie’s warm brown eyes cracked open, meeting Emma's green ones with a soft, shy smile that lit up her face.

'Hey,' Sophie whispered, her hand sliding down to squeeze Emma's ass gently, fingers dipping into the cleft teasingly. 
Emma grinned back, playful even in the morning haze, her red hair a wild mess across the pillow. 
She leaned in, capturing Sophie's soft lips in a slow, lingering kiss, tongues brushing lazily, tasting the faint salt of dried sweat and pussy. 
The kiss deepened for a moment, Emma's hand threading through Sophie's dark hair, pulling just enough to elicit a soft moan. But they broke apart, both chuckling breathlessly, the intimacy feeling natural yet electric.

They untangled slowly, sheets whispering as they sat up, bodies marked with faint red lines from nails and grips. 
Sophie reached for her phone on the nightstand, her tall frame stretching, tits jiggling slightly as she ordered coffee from the app.. two large lattes, extra hot, just how they liked. 'Room service in ten,' she said, tossing the phone aside and scooting closer to Emma. 
Her fingers traced Emma's thigh, a gentle touch that lingered on the inner skin, brushing near her still-swollen pussy lips. Emma shivered, parting her legs instinctively, but Sophie just smiled, pulling her into a side hug instead.

Quiet glances passed between them as they waited, hands intertwining on the bed. 
Emma's heart pounded, replaying the night, the way Sophie's fist had filled her, stretching her pussy to its limits, the relentless suck on her clit that made her squirt like never before. 
It wasn't just the sex; it was Sophie, her best friend, seeing her raw and unraveling. 
Sophie seemed lost in her own thoughts, her free hand absently stroking Emma's arm, eyes soft with something deeper than lust.

The knock came, and Sophie slipped on a robe to grab the coffees, handing one to Emma with a wink. 
They sipped in comfortable silence at first, steam rising between them, the bitter warmth grounding the morning. Emma set her cup down, turning to face Sophie fully, her green eyes searching those warm brown ones.

'Last night... that was amazing,' Emma said softly, her voice thick with emotion, hand squeezing Sophie's knee. 'I mean, fuck, Sophie, your hand inside me, your mouth... I’ve never cum like that. But I don’t want anything between us to change because of this. You’re my best friend. Always.'

Sophie's lips curved into a tender smile, her fingers lacing with Emma's, thumb stroking the back of her hand. 
She leaned in, forehead resting against Emma's, breath mingling. 'It was incredible, Em. Feeling you clench around my fist, tasting you explode on my tongue... god, I want that again. But yeah, nothing changes. We’re us, no matter what. Friends first, always.' Her voice held a protective edge, bold yet comforting, as she pulled Emma into a hug, their bodies pressing close once more.

They savored the moment, coffees forgotten on the nightstand, hearts racing in sync. 
Emma's mind whirled with uncertainty. The friendship charged now, every touch laced with memory of slick heat and moans. Sophie nuzzled her neck, lips grazing the skin, a gentle tease that promised more exploration. Neither knew exactly what came next.",1,1763449452.0,smuttyprose,0,1.0,False

I’m 31M. So I’ll keep it simple, but still, it will be a long post. I suffered from IBS for 11 years and cured myself 100% of it recently. I spent years searching for cures all over the world — did a hell of a lot of research and self-tested expensive meds, hormones, and whatnot. While the fix turned out to be just some tablets from your local medical store and a few lifestyle changes.

Disclaimer: I’m no medical practitioner, nor am I going to sell anything. It’s purely based on my experience.

# Primary causes of IBS

1. SIBO – Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth
2. SIFO – Small Intestinal Fungal Overgrowth
3. Parasites – You may have parasites in your body without any direct symptoms.
4. Heavy metals – Lead, mercury, etc.
5. RO water – If you’re drinking RO water, check the TDS. 0 TDS means you’re drinking distilled water devoid of minerals. The lack of these critical minerals causes lots of issues, especially in mental and physical development of kids/individuals.
6. Dust or mold fungus in your home – These can cause autoimmune reactions in some individuals due to long-term exposure. IBS is one such reaction.

# FIX

1. Rifaximin (sold as Sibofix in India) – To clear SIBO. It works in the intestines only.
2. Fluconazole – To clear SIFO, yeast, and fungal infections.
3. Albendazole – To clear parasites.
4. Zeolite liquid – To remove heavy metals from the body (chelation therapy).
5. Vitamin C – Fixes and heals the gut, especially leaky gut.

# Lifestyle changes

1. Normal tea with spices – To improve digestion and combat bad gut microbiome, and clear biofilms in the gut.
2. Reduce stress – Calm yourself, work on your traumas, and if possible, cut cords with toxic people.
3. Drink tap water after boiling it well (only if your water supply is good). Get mineral water otherwise, or take supplements like copper, iron, magnesium, etc.
   * We switched to tap water as it is good and salt-free. Really a mind-opening experience.
   * (Still finding a way to filter water for toxins and metals but retain minerals.)
4. Start using a vacuum cleaner – Don’t use a broom as it disperses dust into the air, which you end up inhaling 24x7. A vacuum cleaner is good; a robot vacuum is better.
5. Use an air purifier at home – This gets rid of dust and microbes, giving you a chance to inhale pure air.
6. Keep your home clean – Don’t let dust gather.
7. BLACK MOLD – Fix it ASAP like it’s a plague, or move away from that place.

# Regimen (what worked for me)

Sibofix 400 – 14 days, twice a day after meals.

Fluconazole 150 – 14 days, twice a day after meals.

Albendazole 400 – Once a day after meals for 8 days. (15 mg dosage per kg of body weight – calculate accordingly.)

Zeolite – 5 drops in 1 liter of water, 3 times a day (3L daily water intake).

Tea – Made with milk, star anise, bay leaves, cloves, and ginger. Must be pungent – 1 or 2 times a day.

Vitamin C – Take tablets or Vitamin C-rich foods daily.

***EDIT : TAKE THESE MEDICINES ONE BY ONE, Not at the Same time.***

# Tests I conducted on myself to assess the cure

1. I tested myself with 10 full-sized tubs of ice cream so far in a month, pizzas, erratic eating, coffee, tea with full sugar, sodas, food from random restaurants, naan, maida-rich foods, pastries, jams, biscuits, etc. My stools remain consistent, no flatulence or bloating. I used to feel tired and shut down after eating these. Now I’m brisk. I still feel some post-food slump, but only normal levels — not crippling anymore.
2. Went on two long solo drives for 600 km in 13–15 hours during the afternoon, evening, and night. Ate at good restaurants on the way. Was absolutely focused and didn’t feel tired or sleepy. Reached home after 12 a.m. I had never driven after sunset in the past 11 years because of gritty eyes, foggy vision, and body pain after eating.
3. I’ve tried all milk products — ice cream, high-fat milk, paneer, cheese, curd, yogurt, etc. No IBS effects at all. Not lactose intolerant anymore.
4. Tried all wheat and maida-based products — no reactions at all. Not gluten intolerant anymore.

# Positive effects after cure

1. Clarity of mind — finally felt my body like I used to when I was in school. Pain and problem-free. It was really something else. I enjoyed taking deep breaths. The world felt alive again.
2. Improved positivity, clarity, and confidence.
3. Better digestion — poop size and shape stay consistent no matter what.
4. One word: life feels mine once again.
5. Improved clarity, less to no brain fog, sharpness, ability to understand social cues, ability to sync well with life. Earlier it felt like I was blocked out of life.
6. No body pain or joint pain.
7. Cured of blood pressure, increased heart rate, and high cholesterol.
8. Increased endurance.
9. Hormones feel balanced.

# Supplementary lifestyle changes (not necessary but good for you)

1. Reduce or avoid sugar/processed foods — the bad guys in your gut thrive on sugar.
2. Drink water properly.
3. Eat fiber-rich foods — your gut will thank you. If you’re lazy, take isabgol; banana stem is better.
4. Eat healthy — more greens, watery veggies, and fruits.
5. Let your major source of carbs be fruits.
6. Strive to be happy. Go in that direction. No detours.

# Addendum

Since I’m involved with electronics and I poke my nose into all hazardous places, I had a high chance of lead poisoning from soldering with lead-based solder and other heavy metals.  
So kids — if you’re tinkering with soldering, use lead-free material.

# Effects and damages I faced due to IBS

# Biological issues

1. Frequent bloating, inconsistent stools — one day constipated, another day diarrhea.
2. Fibromyalgia, autoimmune symptoms.
3. Sudden hives breakout.
4. Joint pain.
5. Lactose intolerance.
6. Gluten intolerance.
7. Sugar intolerance.
8. When I ate something sugary, my body would shut down.
9. At the peak, I had auto-brewery syndrome — would get drunk from eating carb-rich foods.
   * I could still hear my parents calling me but couldn’t move.
10. Severe inflammation — face would puff up after eating and sleeping; took days to go away.
11. Gritty eyes after eating.
12. Migraines, headaches.
13. Frequent cravings — at one point, I was eating one cooker full of rice and it still wasn’t enough.
14. Felt really weak — eating chicken gave me some relief from body weakness and tiredness. Became a full-time carnivore, but it wasn’t healthy overall.
15. High blood pressure (was taking meds).
16. Increased heart rate.
17. Inconsistent, elevated cholesterol — had to take statins to keep it in check.
18. Taking medicines further made me weak.
19. Frequent stomach ulcers (was losing blood, making me iron deficient).
20. Frequent skin infections.
21. Malabsorption — was deficient in many vitamins and minerals.
22. And many more things I can’t remember now.

# Psychological effects (caused directly or indirectly by IBS)

1. Anxiety, sometimes crippling.
2. Paranoia.
3. Anger issues, rage fueled by high blood pressure and cholesterol.
4. Extreme stress fueled by life events.
5. Suicidal thoughts fueled by life events.
6. Inability to think properly.
7. Brain fog.
8. Negative thoughts.
9. Some more I can’t remember.

# Social effects

1. Fell from grace — from top of the sky to bottom of the ocean, basically became a degenerate.
2. I shut down and was unable to be an active member of society anymore.
3. My dad had this too, which I didn’t know at that time.
4. Family became a shit show — from being a bright family with tons of potential to one people wouldn’t touch with a 10-foot pole.
5. Delayed/stunted life and social growth.
6. Severe financial effects.
7. Unable to drive long distances.
8. Unable to socialize.
9. Couldn’t even eat at relatives’ homes, as I wouldn’t be able to drive back without my body reacting badly and my brain shutting down.
10. Endurance to do anything dropped significantly.

# Coping mechanism

1. Sheer brute-force will, just like how my dad led his entire life until his death.
   * I realized this only recently. We used to get mad at him for having all the talent but being unable to excel.

# When it all started

1. Looking back, it started when I went away from home for university. The uni was top-notch, but the hostel conditions were bad and unhygienic. That’s where it all began.
2. My mom told me my dad also lived in a hostel during childhood and contracted lots of infections, which, in his words, “didn’t let him eat well.”
   * I could really draw parallels between my dad and me.
   * It could be genetic — maybe the immune system is weak or the digestive system is sensitive.

# Meds/Pros/Fixes I tried

1. Endocrinologist 1 – Took tests blindly, said everything was okay, asked me not to stress much.
2. Endocrinologist 2 – Better; said everything was okay except vitamin D. Started taking Vitamin D — felt some relief mentally but didn’t last long.
3. Gastroenterologist – Said everything was okay, advised me to avoid coffee, tea, and milk as I had flare-ups after dairy.
4. General Surgeon – Checked my organs, said all okay; advised more veggies, avoid oily foods.
5. Cardiologist (my mother’s desperation) – I said I felt like sand particles in my eyes. His reply: “Such things don’t happen; it’s in your mind.” (It’s known as gritty eyes today.)
6. Kept searching for a fix — came across testosterone, tried topical creams, then injections. Helped initially, but IBS was still there. It just kept me going on brute force. Stopped when my anger issues got out of control.
7. Ayurvedic enemas from a local store.
8. Many others I’ve forgotten over the years.

# Potential paranormal link

1. This isn’t confirmed, might sound stupid, but looking back — I once went into a graveyard at midnight with a corpse burning and stayed there for 5 minutes to win a bet with friends. Met with an accident the next morning.
   * If I draw a line on my timeline, that’s when life started going south — not just mine but my family’s too.
   * Sister got into an abusive relationship, became suicidal, we had a theft at home, I dropped out twice, social isolation, insane family fights, dad broke down and stopped caring, wrong friends, etc.
   * I’m not blaming external factors for everything, but looking back, it feels like external forces have more control over our lives than we think.

# Vaastu link

It might sound flaky, but hear me out. I started studying Vaastu and Feng Shui, trying to find a scientific connection. Our house had an extreme skew in the southwest corner — the worst as per Vaastu. It’s said to cause tumors, ca\*cer, kidney failures, heart issues, and lower abdomen or psychological issues for men in the family.

Coincidentally:

* My mother developed uterine lumps and suffered for years before removing her uterus.
* My dad developed heart issues in 2014, got better in 2019, but passed away in 2022 from heart-related ailments.
* We fixed the Vaastu in 2019 — things improved, but my IBS and dad’s gut issues remained.

The final fix came when I studied molds and realized BLACK MOLD was causing many issues in our home. Folks, if you have black mold, clean and fix it ASAP — or move away. These microbes wreak havoc on the immune system and body. They practically hijack the mind, make you addicted to dopamine, and reduce rational thinking.

The link:  
Extended southwest corner → high humidity + mold/fungi/algae growth.  
They thrive in the west, as tall trees there reduce sunlight and increase humidity — perfect for mold/algae/fungus growth.

# Astrology link

During my search for answers, I stumbled upon astrology and psychics. Many said there was a family curse and that descendants were paying for ancestral deeds.  
A few astrologers told me to donate blood to fix my karma. That clue about “blood” led me to study deeper — and then I found this:

# Genetic link

After my dad passed, my mom shared his struggles. I could draw parallels between his life and mine — severe body pain, yet he kept going with sheer willpower.  
I started digging into genetics and found the MTHFR gene mutation. People with it often have weak digestion and poor liver detox ability (especially for heavy metals).

So my dad suffered gradually with age, while I experienced it earlier — probably worsened by lifestyle and exposure to toxins.

I also noticed most men from my dad’s side were dull and unmotivated — basically bums. Some were engineers in the ’70s, but still inactive. All had thinning hair, weak bodies, lacking ojas and tejas — the inner fire.

I had all that too, but this “ancestral curse” hit me harder after 18. That curse, IMO, is this MTHFR gene mutation — reducing digestive ability and toxin removal.

Guess what — my hair was thinning more due to lead poisoning from exposure, and my body couldn’t eliminate it. The levels weren’t super high, but still unhealthy.  
Now, after removing heavy metals with zeolite, my hair is growing thick and strong again. Gained motivation, drive, and zeal once more.

If you’ve come this far, I appreciate your patience — and I wish you good luck in regaining control of your life and living the best life you truly deserve.

You aren’t defeated until you accept defeat.

EDIT 1: Eat at hygienic and quality places only. It is easily to contract these sibo sifo parasites through them.

If your mother or father is still healthy and strong, ask them to mash the food with their hands well and feed you. You should get some good guys to your microbiome from that.",1,1763448961.0,u_Narasimhan_Balaji,0,1.0,False

But with so many options available today, how do guests identify truly exceptional hosts? That’s where **Luxury Lodging Host reviews** become invaluable. These reviews serve as firsthand accounts from real guests who have experienced premium stays and are ready to share what stands out, what delights, and what sets a luxury lodging host apart in today’s competitive hospitality landscape.  
  
In this review-style overview, we explore the defining qualities of great luxury lodging hosts, the recurring themes guests rave about, and the subtle details that consistently elevate guest experiences. Whether you're booking your next high-end getaway or simply exploring what makes luxury lodging worth the investment, these insights from **Luxury Lodging Host reviews** offer a clear picture of what excellence looks like.  
  
**Unmatched Commitment to Guest Experience**  
  
One of the most consistently highlighted elements in **Luxury Lodging Host reviews** is the host’s commitment to personalized, attentive service. Unlike traditional hotels, luxury lodging often involves unique, privately managed properties where the host plays a much more hands-on role. Guests frequently comment on how seamless their arrival feels, whether they’re greeted with a personal welcome, a thoughtful tour of the space, or a selection of curated amenities prepared specifically for them.  
  
Many reviewers mention how easy communication is from start to finish. Whether it's answering questions about local attractions or arranging special accommodations—such as early check-ins, curated tours, or dietary-specific treats—top-tier hosts demonstrate a proactiveness that leaves a lasting impression.  
  
These touches might seem small, but as countless **Luxury Lodging Host reviews** highlight, they set the tone for an exceptional stay.  
  
**Thoughtful Design and High-End Comfort**  
  
Luxury lodging isn’t defined by size—it's defined by thoughtful design. Properties may range from modern city lofts to secluded mountain retreats, but they all share something in common: beautifully curated spaces that balance luxury with comfort.  
  
Guests frequently highlight:

Reviewers also appreciate the sense of place conveyed through local art, region-inspired décor, or eco-conscious materials—reminding them that they are staying somewhere special, not just somewhere expensive.  
  
**Curated Amenities That Elevate the Stay**  
  
Amenities often make or break a luxury stay, and guests are quick to highlight them in their reviews. The most praised luxury lodging hosts offer far more than the standard essentials. Instead, they provide curated touches that elevate the stay into an experience.

Reviewers consistently describe:

It’s not just cleanliness guests notice—it’s the attention to detail. Fresh-cut flowers, restocked toiletries, polished glassware, and artfully arranged décor all signal that the host takes pride in the space and holds themselves to exceptionally high standards.  
  
**Exceptional Locations That Offer Peace, Convenience, or Adventure**  
  
A luxury stay isn’t just about the interior—it’s also about where it’s located. Whether nestled in nature or situated in an exclusive urban neighborhood, location plays a major role in the overall experience.

* Scenic views
* Peaceful, private surroundings
* Proximity to upscale dining and shopping
* Easy access to hiking trails, beaches, or cultural hotspots
* Secure, well-maintained neighborhoods

The best luxury lodging hosts choose their locations carefully, ensuring guests can experience the right balance of relaxation and convenience.  
  
**Seamless Digital Experience: Booking to Checkout**  
  
In today’s digital world, convenience matters as much as comfort. A lesser-talked-about yet highly praised aspect in many **Luxury Lodging Host reviews** is how simple and straightforward the booking process is.  
Guests love hosts who provide:

* Clear pricing and policies
* Quick confirmations
* Digital guidebooks
* Easy check-in instructions

Her appearance, her personality like we had so many niche common interests we were just chatting the whole night. I was mostly flirting very lightly with her and then I sat down on a couch and rather than sitting comfortably in the 4 different seats there were, she chose to squeeze in next to me and sit tightly in the fetal position so we were very very close. I gently rested my elbow on her thigh and leaned a bit into her shoulder while she was showing me some pics and she had no reaction (positive or negative). So later when she had to go I asked her to go out for a drink or coffee sometime and she told me SHE HAD A BF. I responded with a slight smile, to be kind, ""Well good for you then..."" and then said bye. Next day I just texted her to send me some pics from the party and I sent her a few of my own and she responded at first but now has left me on sent for 2 days. If anyone has a guess on what's going on in her mind I'd love to know because if there's even a small chance of her liking me, I cannot let her go.

I have PCOS so my periods get very painful. The first day is always the worst, and I’m basically incapacitated for the whole day. My boyfriend, Mark (fake name), has always been relatively sweet and attending during this time. We’ve been together for three and a half years and moved in together last fall. He always reminds me that it’s ‘almost over’ because it only lasts four days, and he gets the stuff done around the house that needs to be done in my absence. 

Yesterday was especially bad. I was doubled over on the floor because it was the only position that provided any relief. Mark had to go to the store, so he said he’d pick up some Midol for me as well as a sweet treat. I asked for some ice cream. He said absolutely. The pain died down enough for me to sit on the couch and relax with my heated blanket until Mark came home an hour later. 

When he did finally come home, he handed me a pint of chocolate ice cream. I absolutely HATE chocolate ice cream. You can call me crazy, I don’t care, but it doesn’t taste like regular chocolate and there are so many other flavors I prefer. I’m autistic and very particular about my food. I have been very clear about this throughout our relationship. Not once have I ever ordered chocolate ice cream anywhere we go. I like ice cream with chocolate IN it, but I don’t like the flavor itself. I asked if he was joking and he said no, and “I know chocolate sometimes helps girls on their periods, so I got that one.”

 I started crying because my hormones were out of wack and tossed the ice cream on the coffee table. Mark looked at me like I just shot his dog and asked why I was being so mean. I admit I yelled at him and asked if he was being rude on purpose because I don’t like that flavor of ice cream. He looked at me like I was stupid and claimed he didn’t know that. He absolutely does, I mention it every time we get ice cream. Mark told me to “handle it myself then”, and stormed off to his room. So there I was, sitting on my couch, ice cream-less for the night. I couldn’t even get up to walk to my own bedroom, so I slept on the couch. Mark still won’t talk to me. No idea what to do.

Wassup fellas, don’t sleep on glute training! They’re not just for your SO to admire, your glutes are one of the most important muscles for blood flow, pelvic control, and thrust power. 

#Glute Squeeze Routine:

- Stand tall, feet hip width apart
- Squeeze your glutes together (like you’re trying to crack a nut)
- Hold the squeeze for 3 seconds, then release and relax fully

At Work:

- Do 2 sets of 15 squeezes every hour when you stand up from your desk (set a timer or pair it with coffee breaks)

At Home (Washing hands, Brushing Teeth, Cooking, Commercial break):

- 2–3 sets of 20 squeezes

Total = 50–100 reps a day, easy.

My first job was modelling when I was 6 months old. By the time I was 3, I’d paid for a renovation on my parents’ house. I modelled until I was 16, by which point I realised that I love academics, and I wanted to apply myself in school more than I wanted to skip double chemistry to drive to a shoot for the next day. 


My mother, a ridiculously beautiful woman and ex-weather girl, put me on the Scarsdale diet when I was 9, and I’ve barely come off of a diet in the 15 years since. When my friends suggest we do something normal and get dinner, I look up the menu and check which sides or kids meals I can get away with. If I’m feeling brave, I suggest a restaurant close to my home so I can pay quickly and go home to throw it up. Because when I did put on weight during my masters, my mom told me “you used to be drop dead gorgeous. Now you just look nice.”. And I don’t know who I am if I’m not a pretty girl. 


I started getting catcalled at 12. I started getting dick pics to the “parental run” Instagram page around the same time. I was groomed, and I was afraid.


My clients love me in my corporate job, and my meeting stats blow my colleagues’ out of the water. But every time I take them to lunch or for coffee, they find an excuse to touch me or talk about their open relationships or their sex lives. I’ve had to stop going to after work drinks because every time someone asks me out and it makes things awkward at work. One time a colleague picked me up and kissed me, and he told me that he stares at my tits all the time. The entire time I told him to put me down, and he kept repeating that his friend, another coworker, would be so upset because he had a crush on me. Prior to this, he told me that I was boring “but with the capacity to be interesting”. No one cares about my personality. 


Earlier this year, I was violently sexually assaulted. It was, without a doubt, the most painful and terrifying experience of my life. I thought I was going to die. And now I have PTSD and a fucked up neck and I can’t help but think that maybe it wouldn’t have happened if my eyes were wonkier or my teeth were crooked. I know that that’s stupid, but it’s the only thing that plays in my head. 


I’ve lost friends because they’ve “fallen in love” with me. When they talk about it, it always starts with “you’re so beautiful”. The ones that stay get mad when I talk about my partner and it feels like if they can’t have me, no one can. Which doesn’t help the thoughts about the assault!


It feels like, whatever I do, I can’t be something else. Men and women stop me in the street to tell me that I’m beautiful. The cleaning staff in my office talk about it when I fill up my water. My parents are so proud of me because I have a pretty face. I’m not allowed to be anything else because of it, and I wish I could just get rid of it. ",3,1763448269.0,confessions,9,0.67,False

I started my coffee journey with SIF with Malgudi, and Cothas coffee powder, ofcourse with milk. It was okay, nothing amazing.

Then I moved on to Blue Tokai beans , bought a French press with my old SIF. I tried Silver Oak, Attikan Estate, and Vienna Roast, all ground by BT for SIF.

Silver Oak was something I enjoyed black. Vienna Roast tasted better with milk. Attikan Estate left me confused — it felt a bit off, so maybe I brewed it wrong. I was using SIF.

Since then, I’ve bought a Kaldipress and a Kingrinder K6 delivered just now.. this is my first grinder and have never used any before .. community said that grinder is the most important thing after the beans , so got the best I could afford.

I was told that I was asking out too many girls even though I asked for their phone numbers at least twice that year(successful but didn't go anywhere). Then tonight I go to another dance tonight it supposedly skewed younger to my age group. I ended up dancing with an older woman(it's all platonic that's how contra goes). So I kept messing up and I accidentally looked at this other dude's girlfriend within the contra line. He told me by ""Hey! Eyes up here"" and he even proceeded to try to move me(to guide me within the contra line) I told him to back off. His girlfriend laughed at me which infuriated me. Then within that same dance line I kept messing up but got the hang of it. I am out of practice for the most part because I tbh don't like going there a lot because it's cliquey. I only know a few people there that I can call my friends. I mess up in the halfway hey this very simple dance I sometimes screw up. Well the that guy who was trying to start something with me had a friend he too had a date. Well this guy says a snide remark (""It's not that hard"") his girlfriend laughed at me along with him snickering towards me. I then bark back at him(No it's not hard).

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Nate, Matt and Abigail were also there, and joined in on some questions which was also fun. It was a little more distracted/spur of the moment with all of them there, but also it was fun to watch them interact and goof off.


I took notes of the questions again, these are summaries of her answers. I left some out-- mostly related to food and snacks lmao. These are summaries vs transcripts, so the wording is mine and is falliable. If I got anything wrong, please let me know, and I'll sticky a comment with corrections.

I wasn't watching the chat, and sometimes Katie didn't have the question in her answer so some questions, I guessed from context clues what was asked-- so some of those may not be exactly what was asked but I believe I got the answer to it right.

Live can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/live/WpA8ygemgt0?si=JAP_H1yODLhHXecR


Any comments/clarifications/etc from me will be in *italics* 

Questions are in **bold**


These are not in order, just more or less grouped by subject.


##Stallions/World Show/Aaron:
+ **Why did Denver do Western Riding and not Western Pleasure for Worlds?:**. They (*Katie and Aaron*) chose to do WR vs WP, because at this point, Denver had beat most of those horses in the same class already. Katie had wanted to do Western Riding with Denver anyways, so they decided to put all their eggs in the same basket for WR and she was so happy they did and how Denver did. Aaron having other horses in WP vs WR also played a part in their decision.
+ **Did she get to ride Denver?:** She did get to ride Denver @ AQHA Worlds after the show (*this out on socials and Snapchat by now, they weren't when the live was done*)
+ **Is Molly going to Aaron?:** Sounded like yes? She hopes to debut Molly in the Versatility Challenge with in her three year old year (*2027*) like Denver was debuted there. Aaron is the trainer for that, so she hopes it works out.
+ **Will Denver stay with Aaron if the focus is being shifted to WR vs WP?:** Denver is staying with Aaron for Western Riding for the moment, and Aaron will still be showing him. When he starts being prepared for Trail, they would need to find a different trainer to work with him for that.
+ With the time at Worlds being so short, they didn't do a meet and greet (but enjoyed doing the coffee cart), she hopes to do one next year.
+ **Were you unhappy about Denver not winning WR?:** Not at all. She was very happy with how well he did for his second show.
+ Someone described her mare, and asked Katie if she thought VS Code Red would be a good fit for her. Katie said that she'd love to say definitely, but without seeing photos of the mare, what the goals were, etc, she didn't feel comfortable blindly endorsing either of her stallions. But if the commenter felt like Waylon or Denver would be a good cross regardless, that was fine with her-- she just didn't want to thumbs up without knowing more about the mare.
+ **What do you think of Quarabs, and using Waylon?:** She thought it makes sense, both breeds can compliment each other, and she is open to the idea.


##Mares and Foaling 2026:
+ First due date for 2026 foaling season is 1/20 (Raven)
+ **Who is mare and foal on groove life rings?:** She wasn't totally sure, but said it could possibly be Trudy.
+ **When are the paints coming to the farm?:** After Thanksgiving, probably in December-- they aren't in a rush. Buttercup is coming sooner (*lol, much sooner, she is headed there today*) and Katie is very excited about it.
+ **Who are you breeding Ginger too?:** She had been thinking Wild Carrd for this coming year, but she saw the video from Unbridle Your Dreams' owner, and it made her laugh but also really tempted her. She had already been going back forth between the two, and that video made the choice that much harder.
+ On a question about which horse she missed the most, Katie said that Opal showed signs of colic shortly after Katie left, and TVS had trailered her to the vet. Katie thinks Opal will be ok, but it's always worrying. (*Edit, since this live Katie posted an update (on 11/17) about Opal and she is doing better and home now.*)
+ **Would you breed to Nothing But Nett?:** She really likes NBN, thinks he's a very cool stallion. Sounded opened to it.
+ **Would you breed Kennedy to Good Better Best?:** She would love to, she really likes that idea. She doesn't have embyros banked for it, but maybe in the future. She really likes the idea of Kennedy with a HUS type stallion.
+ **What happened with the Bestseatinthesouth embryo?:** It is on hold for right now, with everything happening last year she had too many mares and not enough stalls. (*Editor note: I'm not sure if that means on hold until the 2026 breeding season, or possibly further out-- she didn't give a timeline. Next year, the 2027 foals, would have more space though.*)
+ **Can she give Rikki's foal it's barn name?:** She believes so. The foals owner (*Rikki's old owner*) are choosing the registered name but she thinks she can probably pick the barn name. But will double check before foaling.
+ **Do you have any barn names picked for the 2026 foals?:** She has a couple names she's thinking of, particularly for Raven's foal (*OBCxVSCR*). For a filly, Violet and for a colt, Crow.
+ **Has she decided on any registered names?:** She has some ideas for a couple of the foals, but she won't share them until the foals arrive to avoid trolling/people deliberately using them so she can't use them.
+ **What would be her dream mare?:** Katie didn't say a specific mare, but described one that exemplifies the look and movement she loves, is not related to her stallions, and one that can be shown and bred. After the chat mentioned color, she added that color would be nice, vs more red or bay. But color was definitely an after thought, and after prompting.
 + **If a buyer requested more testing then she does, would she do it?:** Katie already does standard testing, and would oblige for things like LWS (*lethal white syndrome*) but doesn't know when it would apply realistically. 
+ **Is she keeping any 2026 foals?:** She is definitely keeping the WHxVSCR baby and the OBCxVSCR baby due to the costs of the embyros, and most likely she will keep the Trudy/FTF baby.
+ **Would you ever buy full sibling to Beyonce to breed her?** No, not when she has Beyonce herself to breed (*via ICSI*)
+ **Are you excited for the WH embryo?:** She is very excited about the WH embyro, especially after this show season and how much Waffles has killed it in the ring. She is very excited to see how this baby turns out.
+ **Why don't you ride Trudy?:** She said that Trudy acts like something hurts when ridden, and they can't find a reason why she acts that way after vet visits. Trudy came to her this way-- the previous owners had noted she acted like something hurt, and they couldn't find a reason for her behavior. Since they can't find a reason for her to be in pain and she doesn't *need* to be ridden, she just isn't. 
+ **Would you stop breeding mares and cutting them from your program if needed?:** Yes and she has. She gave examples like Ethel, who was retired from carrying her own foals after both her colts died since they couldn't find an answer for it. She would also retire a mare if the mare was not doing great being pregnant, she would not breed her again.


##Running Springs, Mini Farm and the other horses/animals:
+ **When do Jack and Gretchen leave?:** In twoish weeks
+ **Are you breeding the mini donkeys anytime soon?:** She said she doesn't think so, and started to go into a more detailed answer. ..but then she got distracted by skeeball being set up and she went on a side quest, so never finished that answer.
+ **""How is Bo doing?:** She said he was doing good, but didn't offer more or elaborate. (*editor/mod note: please no speculation on why/prognosis being good or bad or hiding things, because real animal and real people. She said he was good.*)
+ **When is Taz coming?:** In December, she will have him with Honey and Bee but not the older girls. She doesn't want multiple goats kidding at the same time, and feels that could be overwhelming. So only the two girls for right now, and undecided if she will breed the older goats next year.
+ **Have you ever considered hiring someone like Gaven Young?:**[*for an in-house trainer*] (*Gaven is one of Aaron's assistant trainers*) Katie loves Gaven, but Gaven is looking for outside horses for training to aim towards showing them, she's looking for a trainer for her horses. Not specifically for showing, but for training yearlings and the two year olds.
+ **Does she think that her goats could bring down the market for well bred/papered goats?:** She doesn't agree with this point of view, and she doesnt see it as saturating market with her goats, since she primarily gives them to friends and family who want them and keeps herself to small amounts of babies at a time, vs continually breeding lots of goats and having lots of babies.
+ She was asked about doing liberty (*a class mini horses show in*), she said she has never tried liberty, wants too, and thinks it would be fun
+ **What are the plans for Penelope?:** Goal is show Penelope next year; she likely won't show until NSBA worlds, but possibly earlier- the range she gave was anywhere from April to August. Also hugely depends on Penelope's maturity and how she comes along. She will be showing with Jamie English in open, 3yo futurities. Katie would love to show Penelope as an ammy if Penelope is in the right place later in the year. KVS acknowledged she would need to ride a lot more to do that, but it's part of the plan and things are in the works (in house trainer and etc). That whole group of foals (Penelope, Phfinn, and Petey) should all be showing next year and they (*Katie, Nate, Matt, Abigail*) are all excited because this is the first foal crop they were all there for them as foals up to them showing, so they are planning some cool videos to be able to show that growth.
+ **What are the plans for Wally?:** Wally is staying home for right now to keep growing and maturing, especially if they have an in home trainer at Running Springs. She still wants to do over fences, pleasure driving, English versatility with him but thinks that will be in the far future. For him, she thinks foundations are very important, and wants to be focusing on that with him.
+ Doesn't think Bonnie has had her baby yet
+ **Where is Wheezy going?:** Wheezy is going to the Englishes. If she does well with HUS, she'll stay with them but if fences are more her thing, she'll go to the same place Katie is thinking about for Wally. 
+ **What are the plans for Phinn?:** She has gotten some updated videos and photos of him from his trainer, and said he's doing really well. He's hopefully showing later this year as well.


For Abigail/Matt/Nate:
+ **Did Matt get his nose pierced?:** ""No. Because no one has time management skills. Across the board."" --Matt. He said it will be done by the KUWK filming on Tuesday (11/18), Katie (and everyone else) seemed doubtful due to the tight turnaround. Nate and Matt are also getting matching tattoos, but not by Tuesday.
+ **Who is everyone's favorite horse at Running Springs?:** Matt's favorite is Ethel. Nate said Trudy first (""Why?!""-- Katie), but changed his answer to Sophie. He joked he only likes the very small or very tall horses. Abigail's favorite is Gracie.
+ **""When does Abigail bring the goats home?"":** ""When I have a fence.""-- Abigail. She's moving to the new property this week, a fence for the goat area will likely come pretty quickly after that, and then she can bring the boys home.
+ **Would Abigail take videos of goaties on her own channel?:** Abigail said she would probably every now and then, but not to count on daily videos or updates. She's getting goats and chickens because she wants to have them, vs focusing her social media accounts on them.
+ **What was their favorite class to watch?:** Matt and Nate said trail was their favorite class, they liked that the riders could pick their own music and the audience could be a little more animated (*ie, whistle, cheer,.etc*). Matt and Nate also have a lot of ideas for marketing the Versatility Challenge, and wants the organizers to contact them 😂😂
+ **How is Pico?:** ""Looking great and doing amazing."" - Nate
+ **Is Pico gelded?:** No
+ **Is Matt on reddit?:** No. But he looks things up on reddit.
+ **Matt needs more animals!:** He used to have animals, grew up on farm. It sounded like he was open to it but not currently. (*Editor note; he's mentioned not wanting/having pets right now due to the baby, so that is probably the 'not currently'. He was also a little further from the camera, so wasn't super clear.*)
+ **Would Nate do a duet with Katie?:** Nate said he would, but it's on Katie's time so he encouraged people to pressure her into it so she'd do it.
+ **If you could have any horse and keep it at RS, what would you get?:** Fell pony for Matt. Working ranch horse for Nate. Nate's wife was watching the live, and she texted him to say that she wanted a friesian. They joked that what they really wanted though was a bay or roan quarter horse.



Etc:

+ **Where's Jonathan?:** Asleep. (*lmao*)
+ **Who is favorite of the three?:** (*Nate, Matt, Abigail*)**?:** ""They've all had mouthy moments, so I don't know."" -- Katie (*editor note: this was a joke*)
+ **Will there be Christmas merch?:** There is Christmas merch in the store, she just hasn't made a video about it yet. That is coming soon.
+ **How long is the fall merch staying?:** She didn't have an exact timeline, but probably through Thanksgiving
+ **What was the best buy of shopping spree?:** Nate was excited most for his new hat. Katie got a new necklace she's excited about and might show. Jonathan bought two new knives. She was specifically asked about if knives were bought, and said Jonathan is a bit of knife fiend.
+ **Would they do a music jam session live?:** She thought that would be fun.
+ **Have you seen the tiktok songs about your horses?:** She said that outside of work (posting videos and checking comments) she actually doesn't watch much Tiktok. So she knows they exist but hasn't seen them. Tiktok for her is work vs pleasure, she doesn't want to spend a lot of her free time on it.
+ **Will she go to Equine Affair?:** She has been asked if she would speak at EA before, but it's difficult timing wise. But she is open to going in the future.
+ **If you sell an embryo, are you the breeder?:** No, the mares owner at time of implant is the breeder
+ **Would you have an internship at RS?:** Not now, there isn't enough work to justify it, but in the future there might be space for it.
+ She acknowledged some growing pains with the live-- future ones will have a mod presence. This live compared to the first seemed to have more trolls/people causing problems in the comments. Also might have pre-selected questions vs just trying to read from a very fast chat. Also threw out the idea of just having a camera running while they played games, or hung out. (Seemed to have concerns about Nate possibly saying something he shouldn't 😂😂)

This community's been a great help in planning my trip, and I'd love some specific advice over parts of my itinerary.

**MADRID & ANDALUSIA, DECEMBER 20-31**

**Madrid, late December 20-early December 24**: I'm pretty sorted here, excited about museums, parks and trying food in North and West African restaurants, which I don't get a ton of in my part of the world. Question: is there a walking route by the Manzanares you'd recommend?

**Sevilla, early December 24-early December 26**: I know, I know. I'll come back when everything's open. For now, this is largely marked for walking the city and by the river. Questions: 1. Will the Murillo gardens and the garden of Buhaira be open on Christmas day? 2. I don't want to eat out of the bins if I can help it :) Are there non-Spanish restaurants that will be open over these days? (Moroccan? Chinese? McDonalds? ;\_\_\_;) How do you recommend I shop for food for those 36 hours or so when everything will be shut? I really don't want to eat the posh menu fixe at my hotel or any other if I can help it.

**Granada, Midday December 26-early December 29**: I'm so excited about this I can barely contain myself. Question: Are there walking routes in the city, not oriented towards the Alhambra, that you'd recommend? I'd love to see a bit of city life, get a coffee and watch the buses go past, etc.

**Cordoba: Midday December 29-afternoon December 30**: I'm thinking of heading to the Medina Azahara on the evening of the 29th, and saving the Mezquita for the morning of December 30. Would you recommend taking a train down to the nearest station and walking to the Medina, or a bus?

I'm also looking forward to eating Andalusian food in Granada and Cordoba -- if you have recommendations for winter dishes you love to eat in these parts, please do say. Thanks a ton and happy festive season, everyone!",1,1763447351.0,GoingToSpain,3,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.
