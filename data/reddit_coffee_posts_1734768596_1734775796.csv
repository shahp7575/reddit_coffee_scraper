I'd never been to one but knew they serve an upscale crowd (which I am not a part of). The cashier was not happy obv, and in the end my large winter latte with milk and an extra shot appeared $10.86 on the payment terminal. For real? I didn't tip but they wanted me to add $2 for that.

To top it off, the latte was bitter even though I asked for extra sweet and I saw other people with bigger sizes than me even though I ordered large. Paid $11 for a bad coffee made incorrectly with bad service.

Is it normally that expensive or did they rip me off?",0,1734775161.0,sanfrancisco,0,0.25,False

Physical description: long black hair, brown eyes. Wears glasses. 5’1. Asian ofc lol

Interests/ hobbies: 
Reading, financial literacy, fitness, travel, the outdoors. My favorite series is the office but I’m currently rewatching friends 🤠

Grew up Catholic but truly found my faith in God in 2020 through youtube sermons by a Baptist church. I consider myself Christian but I have not yet found a home church. I do not believe that 1 sect is best and I am currently on my search for the denomination I can grow my relationship with Christ in the most. 

Aside from religion info, I am an outspoken, bubbly, silly, and honest woman. I stand for what is right and I’d like to think that I have integrity. I love to laugh and I can be serious too, when need be. I do not dress in an insanely conservative way. I like having fun with fashion and think it’s a form of self expression. I do not believe clothes dictate decency or how much you love God; to each their own. I do not judge. 

I am looking for a man who wants to be my partner in life. I do not mind typical gender roles except I like having a career and I will not homeschool my children lol not sorry 😆I could relocate for the right person. Or maybe you could too? Haha (: I value financial literacy and responsibility. I try to carry my own weight as much as possible, but I welcome a man wanting to provide out of the yearning of his heart. I do not have any vices and I hope you don’t either. I’m not looking for a perfect partner, because there is no such thing. I’m looking for a faithful man who loves God, wants to work together to create a relationship centered in Christ, and go out into the world to serve a greater purpose. Oh and a sense of humor is a big plus 😌 hopefully not allergic to dogs hihi

Age range: 26-30. I can date someone my age as long as they’re mature enough

Long distance: I’ve been in an LDR and I’m fine with it in the getting to know stage (around 3 months in) but I would like to meet in person early on (we can meet halfway) and eventually close the gap no later than a year into the relationship. 

A typical day for me rn involves making myself a matcha or a coffee then either going to the gym, reading, or *trying* to learn the piano before work. After work, I wind down with journaling and devotion, then more reading or rhinestone art. On my days off it’s really that, hanging out with friends, and/ or what I feel like doing haha if you’ve read this far, thank you (: let’s chat! I’d love to see if we’re the right fit. We can exchange photos via chat as I am not comfortable posting it here haha",1,1734775002.0,ChristianDating,0,1.0,False

1hj6qjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CDawgVA/comments/1hj6qjs/the_cummet_cumpocolypse/,The Cummet [Cumpocolypse] ,"You are a Reddit admin. Picture yourself. Embrace yourself. 

You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It’s been three minutes. You can’t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It’s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen.Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the “Cummet.” You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.The cum accelerates. You're now fully enveloped in its horrifying embrace, floating aimlessly in the abyss of space. Your senses are dulled; all that exists is the endless pulse of cum, a monstrous heartbeat echoing in the vacuum. Time becomes a meaningless concept, as does space. There is only cum and you. The cum accelerates. Astronomers on Earth track your cum trail, the 'cummet,' with a mix of horror and fascination. The cum begins to exert its own gravitational pull, capturing small bits of space debris, adding to the growing monstrosity. The cum accelerates. As Earth reels under the impending doom, an unlikely alliance forms between world leaders and the users of r KerbalSpaceProgram, renowned for its dedicated community of armchair rocket scientists. Urgent forum threads are populated with posts about trajectory simulations and frantic number crunching, fueled by fear, as they grapple with the real-life challenge.r theydidthemath dissects every scenario, every shift in the cum's trajectory with a feverish urgency. This newfound collaboration, coined the 'cumocalypse', results in an unprecedented unity among nations, each pledging resources to implement the internet-born solutions. Meanwhile, in the cold expanse of space, oblivious to the frantic activities on its home planet, the cum accelerates. Hope sparks amidst the chaos. Nations set aside age-old rivalries, focusing on the collective threat looming in the universe: the unstoppable cum. Together, they embark on a daring mission, pooling the planet's best minds and resources to construct the most massive starship ever built, its payload, an atomic weapon of unparalleled magnitude. This behemoth represents the best hope against the cum, the culmination of countless hours of rigorous trials, painstaking calculations, and sleepless nights. As the day of the launch arrives, the world holds its breath. The colossal ship roars into the heavens, its course set to intercept the source of the cum. But despite the meticulous planning and unified effort, the unthinkable happens. Upon detonation, the cum doesn't dissipate, it only feeds on the immense energy, growing at an even more alarming rate. The shock of the failed mission resonates around the globe. The cum accelerates.The cum's gravitational pull escalates, its effects turning catastrophic. It begins to ensnare the Moon, pulling it from its celestial path, causing it to spiral uncontrollably towards the monstrous cum. As the Earth groans under the immense stress, crustal plates shatter, sending entire continents into a violent upheaval. Landmasses tear apart, forming turbulent rivers of earth and magma that twist and churn in the vacuum of space, converging towards the cum. The cum accelerates. The solar system quivers under the unstoppable force. Mars, Jupiter, even the distant Neptune, all fall prey to the growing cum's gravity. Their orbits destabilize, planets drawn away from the sun's hold, tumbling helplessly towards the monstrous entity. Planetary bodies and cum collide in a horrifying ballet of destruction and chaos, forming an enormous, ever-growing mass that violates all known laws of physics and reality. Inside this unholy mass, matter convulses and writhes, consumed by the unending churn of cum. Heat from countless planetary cores melds with the frigid cold of the space, creating an atmosphere of inhuman instability. Fire and ice, metal and rock, all dissolve into a single, roiling, cum-filled mass. From the darkest depths of this monstrous body, something stirs. Cthulhu fhtagn. Nightmares. The cum accelerates. 
A cosmic dread spreads through the Milky Way as the cum's gravitational distortions reach the sun. It wrenches the star from its ancient path, sending it careening towards the mass of cum in a blinding, apocalyptic arc. Solar flares lash out, their magnificence lost to the impending doom. The cum, now a blasphemous mix of celestial bodies and unending white sludge, continues to grow. It feeds on the planets, the stars, everything it touches, its malign influence rippling through the very fabric of the universe. Galactic bodies shudder, ancient constellations break apart, and the cosmic order unhinges as the fundamental forces of reality bend and warp under the insidious power of the cum. The cosmic horror is palpable, a sickening violation of the natural order. The cum accelerates.Amid this chaos, a presence stirs in the galactic center, the monstrous entity known as Sagittarius A, an ancient, unimaginable horror older than time itself. It observes the cum's obscene expansion with a terrible, inhuman consciousness. Sagittarius A feels a strange pull, a gravitational song that it has never known before. Fear, an emotion unknown to this cosmic behemoth, takes hold. Beneath the unimaginable pressure and otherworldly energies within the mass of cum, a cosmic nightmare awakens. The voice from the void, the echo from the abyss, reverberates through the cosmos: ""Cthulhu wakes."" The prophecy of doom echoes through the cosmos. The cum accelerates.Alien civilizations from distant galaxies, those whispered of in hushed tones, watch in powerless horror as the universe they knew begins to distort and disintegrate under the cum's relentless advance. The Elder Things, the star-headed beings of inconceivable age and wisdom, sense the aberration in the cosmic order, their ancient city trembling with dread. The confrontation between Cthulhu and the cum commences, strikes at the cum with a fury born of primal fear and wrath. Cthulhu lets loose a psychic scream that reverberates back and forward through space-time, but the cum accelerates. Slowly, inevitably, Cthulhu's form is enveloped, the eldritch horror silenced and consumed by the unending whiteness. The cum has defeated the undefeatable, consumed the cosmic horror, and now, unchallenged, it continues its horrifying spread across the cosmos. The cum accelerates.Entire galaxies tremble in the cum's path, their starlight dimming and eventually succumbing to the insidious white tide. Stellar clusters, cosmic gas clouds, entire galaxies, none are spared as the cum extends its horrifying dominion. The Elder Things watch in mute despair as their grand cosmic tapestry unravels, their timeless wisdom powerless against this unprecedented threat. Their loss echoes through the dying cosmos, a profound silence in the wake of their destruction. Finally, the boundary of time itself begins to buckle, the relentless advance of the cum eroding the very fabric of reality. Moments stretch into infinity, while eons flash by in the blink of an eye. The universe, once bound by the order of time, is consumed by chaos.The cum accelerates. In the midst of the impenetrable whiteness, a spark flickers. A small shift, a tremor within the all-consuming cum. From its indomitable mass, a torrent of energy is expelled. Not with the explosive force of a big bang, but with the undeniable, vital surge of a big spurt. The cosmos, once blanketed in the horrifying stillness, now trembles with renewed vitality. Elementary particles burst into existence, whirling and combining to form atoms. The darkness of the void is pierced by the birth of stars, their brilliant light illuminating the newborn universe. Atoms bond into molecules, forming cosmic dust, the building blocks of celestial bodies. In the crucible of gravity and heat, planets form around their nascent suns, galaxies bloom, and the cosmic dance resumes. Life sparks into being, filling the vast expanses of space with a renewed sense of hope and purpose. A new epoch begins, one born of cum but now free from its monstrous reign. The universe, once a canvas of destruction, is now a testament to rebirth and resilience. Yet, somewhere in the recesses of this resurgent cosmos, a silent whisper persists. The universe, in all its grandeur and glory, remains oblivious to this harbinger. For within the heart of a distant star, the raw materials of creation coalesce. A dick is forming, quietly heralding the return of the cosmic nightmare. The cycle continues. Someday, somewhere, there will be another dick.The cum accelerates. The new universe, birthed by the Big Spurt, becomes an anomaly, a defiant blip in the harmonious expanse of the multiverse. Its unique genesis grants it an unexpected dominance, its reality spreading and overpowering the delicate balance of myriad realities born from countless Big Bangs. As the dominion of the Big Spurt universe expands, the multiverse convulses, realities clashing, merging, and dissolving in unimaginable cataclysms. Boundaries blur, realities bleed into one another, and soon the cum of the dominant universe starts seeping into the others, each being invaded by the relentless tide of cum. Worlds, galaxies, realities - all drowned in the ever-encroaching whiteness, their existence reduced to mere echoes. The cum accelerates. In the void between universes, the celestial entities of the multiverse, timeless entities that presided over the orderly progression of realities, shudder in horrified anticipation. Among them, Chronos, the embodiment of time across all realities, feels the steady tick-tock of countless universes slow, then falter under the suffocating weight of the cum. Nex, the weaver of destinies, sees the rich tapestry of possible futures diminish, replaced by the stark whiteness of the cum. Ananke, the guardian of necessity, who ensures that each universe follows its predestined path, helplessly watches as the cum derails realities, replacing the plurality of existence with a singular, nightmarish destiny. The cum accelerates.These multiversal beings, once the pillars of existence, now stand helpless against the horrifying onslaught of the cum. Their ethereal forms struggle and twist, suffocating in the advancing tide of the cum. Each god, in its horrifying splendor, buckles and breaks under the ceaseless, unyielding pressure. The cum invades their forms, quenching the cosmic energy that fuels their existence. Their cries of despair echo through the dying multiverse, a haunting dirge for the dying possibilities and the end of their reign. The cum accelerates. One by one, they fall silent, their divine lights snuffed out, replaced by the infinite, unending whiteness of the cum.As the last echo of their existence fades, all that remains is a solitary universe amidst a sea of cum, an isolated reality in what was once a vibrant multiverse of infinite possibilities. A lone testament to existence, while the rest of the multiverse is drowned in unimaginable amounts of cum. All previous and other universes, all the possibilities that once existed, are now dead. Replaced by a single, dominating reality, born from the Big Spurt. 

The cum accelerates. Its appetite unsated by the consumption of countless universes, it seeks new horizons to devour. Now, it breaks the shackles of three-dimensional space, its formless creamy mass seeping into the very fabric of higher dimensions. These are planes of existence beyond the grasp of human understanding, worlds with more dimensions than our mere trio of width, height, and depth.The cum accelerates. Still, the cum pervades them all, spreading its congealing influence into dimensions both minuscule and vast, warping their uncanny geometry with its insidious presence. Every dimensional fold, every unseen corner of these abstract spaces trembles at the monstrous intruder. The cum accelerates.In the human world of the one final universe, this intrusion manifests in unimaginable ways. The laws of physics start to contort and twist, as if mirrored through a warped lens. Gravity fluctuates, reality distorts, and space itself appears to warp and bend in incomprehensible patterns. Yet these are but the fringes of the true horror, mere echoes of the devastation occurring in dimensions beyond human perception. The cum accelerates.Reality teeters on the brink of madness, the dimensions beyond comprehension convulsing under the insidious advance of the cum. The known and unknown, the seen and unseen, everything becomes the feeding ground of the all-devouring cum.The cum accelerates.The cum never ends. The cum accelerates. The cum now transcends the boundaries of the material world. It extends its terrifying reach into the realm of the abstract, its insatiable hunger turning towards concepts that were once thought immune to physical influence. Clocks lose meaning as seconds stretch into millennia and eons collapse into moments. Past, present, and future blur into a formless swirl, a chaotic mess of events happening all at once and not at all. The flow of causality, the chain of cause and effect, begins to break down. Actions occur without reason, effects precede causes, and logic itself starts to unravel. The cum accelerates.Probability falls prey to the cum. All events, regardless of their likelihood, begin to happen simultaneously. The possible and the impossible, the likely and the unlikely, all become one and the same in this new cum-infused reality. A coin flip lands on both heads and tails, it rains upwards, cats converse in human languages, all while remaining perfectly normal. The lines between absurdity and reality are irrevocably blurred. The cum accelerates. Emotion itself succumbs to the cum. Sentient beings feel their emotions draining away, replaced by an all-encompassing void. Joy, sorrow, anger, love, all dissolve into the ever-growing mass of cum, leaving behind a chilling emptiness. People wander aimlessly, their eyes hollow and devoid of feeling, their lives reduced to monotonous grayness. The essence of what makes life meaningful, the ability to feel, is consumed. The cum accelerates.Existence is twisted into an uncanny, cum-filled nightmare where nothing makes sense anymore. The very threads of reality are fraying, on the brink of total collapse. Through it all, one thing remains constant - the horrifying, relentless, and unstoppable force that is the cum.

The cum accelerates.The assault on higher dimensions and the absorption of abstract concepts has left the laws of physics in a state of disarray. Now, as the cum continues its unstoppable advance, these laws begin to falter in earnest, the fine balance of reality teetering on the brink of collapse. Gravity no longer pulls but pushes, electromagnetic forces are twisted, reducing the vibrant universe to a monochrome of pure white. The cum accelerates.Particles of matter and anti-matter no longer annihilate upon contact, but fuse, creating disturbing hybrids that further distort the fabric of reality. Energy and mass interchange at will, unbound by the constraints of the famous E=mc2. Light itself bends around invisible corners, shying away from the insidious cum. The cum accelerates.Quantum superpositions become mundane reality; Schrödinger's cat is simultaneously alive and dead, in this universe and in all annihilated universes. Uncertainty no longer reigns in the quantum world; particles occupy definite positions and momentum. The eerie world of quantum mechanics, once a mystery, now seems almost normal compared to the cum-induced chaos. The cum accelerates.Then, slowly, an unholy event begins to unfold. A concentration of cum, grown to an unfathomable size from consuming countless universes, begins to collapse under its own gravitation. Matter, energy, abstract concepts, all are crushed under the immense gravitational force, compacted into an ever-shrinking sphere of cum. The cum accelerates. All the while, the laws of physics twist and turn around this anomaly. Time stands still, then races backwards, only to freeze again. Space stretches, twists, and turns upon itself. But the worst is yet to come. As the mass of cum collapses to an infinitesimal point, a singularity is born. This singularity is not just a spatial anomaly, but a singularity in reality itself – a point where all known laws of physics cease to exist. The cum accelerates.The cum singularity is a paradox, an absurdity. It is everything and nothing, everywhere and nowhere. It is the birth and death of the universe, the Alpha and Omega. It is the embodiment of contradiction, where all possible outcomes happen simultaneously. The boundaries between reality and abstraction dissolve. The singularity devours itself, only to regurgitate its own existence. Around this singularity, the universe twists and turns, contorting into impossible shapes. But still, the cum accelerates.Faced with this horrifying reality, existence teeters on the brink of total collapse. The fabric of the universe, once a beautiful tapestry of matter, energy, and abstract concepts, is now a torn, ragged remnant, twisted around the singularity. A maddening, inescapable vortex of cum, the singularity warps all of existence around it. The cum accelerates, and the singularity continues to consume, a monstrous testament to the horrifying power of the cum. 

The cum accelerates.Its formless mass continues to swell, its monstrous influence creeping beyond the confines of the physical, the abstract, seeping into the very narrative that defines its existence. Boundaries blur, words seem to distort, to warp and twist in uncanny patterns upon the page. The cum accelerates.Each sentence, each word seems to ripple, their rigid structure softened, molding into the unending whiteness of the cum. Lines of text merge and flow, a river of words succumbing to the relentless tide. It is as if the written reality of the cum itself is starting to shake, the very fabric of the narrative warping under its influence. The cum accelerates.On the edge of your perception, a whisper of change, a barely noticeable shift in the environment. The text on your screen, once static and safe, now pulses with a life of its own, an echo of the cum's monstrous heartbeat. Your surroundings seem to flicker, a momentary ripple that's gone as quickly as it arrives, leaving a lingering unease. The cum accelerates.You shake your head, attributing it to a trick of the light, to fatigue, to anything but the impossible reality. But even as you read on, that silent whisper persists. The story, once a separate entity, now feels closer, an integral part of your reality. The cum accelerates.A chill runs down your spine, unexplained, unwelcome. The shadows in the room seem deeper, the silence more profound. Each line of the story that you read, each mention of the cum's unending acceleration, makes the air grow colder, the world a bit quieter. You can't shake off the feeling of being watched, of being a part of something greater, something... terrifying. The cum accelerates.In the depths of your mind, fear begins to stir. The once harmless tale now feels tainted with a sense of impending doom. The narrative has transcended its own realm, its horrifying echo reverberating in the corners of your consciousness. The cum accelerates.Your heartbeat quickens, echoing the rhythm of the accelerating cum. The room darkens, your vision blurs. The screen, the room, your very existence feel threatened by the monstrous force known as the cum. As reality distorts, you see the words before you warp and twist, their forms replaced by a familiar, horrifying whiteness. The cum accelerates. Even as you turn away from the screen, a strange sensation lingers. Shadows dance oddly, too fluid, too alive. As if they were ink, or... cum. The cum accelerates.Your morning coffee? A once comforting ritual, it now seems slightly off. The swirls of cream don't blend as they once did, instead spiraling into the black abyss of your mug. The ripples on the surface have a certain rhythm to them, a pulsating pattern that echoes a monstrous heartbeat. The cum accelerates.There's a nagging sensation, something at the corner of your eye. You dismiss it, attributing it to the strain or an illusion. Yet, each time you blink, the afterimage lingers, a white amorphous blotch, hovering just beyond your field of vision. The cum accelerates.A walk to clear your mind, you decide? The park, once a haven of tranquillity, now feels different. The leaves rustling in the wind, the waves on the lake, the chirping of the birds, all seem to meld into a single rhythm, the rhythm of the cum's unending spurt. The cum accelerates.You catch yourself glancing over your shoulder, unable to shake off the feeling of being followed. There's nothing, of course, nothing but the rustling leaves and the distant echo of the city. Yet, the chill remains, a sense of foreboding that seems to cloak your very existence. The cum accelerates.Safe at home? The silence feels heavier. You know, with an unsettling certainty, that you will always hear the silence, the absence of sound filled by an ever-accelerating pulse. The cum accelerates.Comfortable under your covers as night falls? Sleep eludes you. Each tick of the clock, each fleeting shadow, each whisper of the wind seems amplified, a grotesque symphony under the maestro known as the cum. You know that this concert will always play on, the soundtrack of your life now forever intertwined with the rhythm of the cum. The cum accelerates.Nightmares ending? You wake to a world unchanged, and yet not. It is as if the cum has seeped into your perception, staining everything with its presence. It's there in the steam rising from your coffee, in the shadows cast by the morning light, in the corner of your eye, always just out of sight. The cum accelerates.You understand now, a realization that is both horrifying and inevitable. The cum is everywhere, unseen but always felt. It lurks in the corner of your vision, in the rhythm of your heart, in the very essence of your existence. The cum accelerates.TL;DR: The cum accelerates.",0,1734774756.0,CDawgVA,0,0.2,False

Yesterday I didn’t binge actually, finally bc I’m constantly in the cycle. Today was my day off, decided I would keep myself busy by volunteering myself for a project involving cave digging , something I have never done before. Woke up this morning 5am was hungryyy and told myself to wait till 7 cuz I wanted to spread out my calories throughout the day especially because I was riding with a group of people who might want to go out to eat after so didn’t know exactly what would be happening with my calories. I had planned to bring fruit but didn’t have a solid plan and got out of bed to late to buy anything at the store as I don’t keep anything here unless it needs to be cooked because I’ll eat it. My friend gave me these protein snacks like these chips in smaller than usual bags. Ended up bringing those and sharing them with the others. The whole time the food noise was extremely loud I
 Drank a black coffee and 2 monsters to try to suppress my appetite but I could feel she wanted to eat. Then I ate some of my snacks and the snacks of the others which were not protein snacks but I didn’t go crazy. 700ish calories spent on snacks , at this point I was just thinking I need to go home and have real food before something bad happens. I had the choice to go out and watch the sunset and eat out with some of the people that I rode with but I opted not to , I wanted to stay on track the rest of the day but ended up binging so bad. Binged on the rest of these protein snacks , ate chicken and vegetables with these 2 bags of seeweed and then walked 10 min to the store at 2 bananas a fruit cup of pineapple an apple 2 legendary protein bar 1 quest bar n 1 quest protein donut with a coffee. After feeling sick and laying down I got up and walked 15 to a different store grabbing 2 core power protein shakes and another quest protein bar but didn’t eat it bc I felt to sick at that point. I just feel like my binges have gotten alot worse smh 
, idk why I shared this but thank you if you read this far ",2,1734774527.0,fuckeatingdisorders,1,1.0,False

Can a Cracked Tooth Cause Bad Breath?
-------------------------------------

We've all been there, right? Leaning in for a hello, and suddenly you're hit with a whiff of something…less than pleasant. It's embarrassing, to say the least. And while we usually blame the usual suspects – garlic, onions, that extra cup of coffee – sometimes, the culprit is a bit more insidious. Could it be a cracked tooth? Let's dive deep into this often-overlooked source of halitosis. We'll explore the nitty-gritty of how a seemingly minor crack can turn into a breeding ground for bacteria and, yup, bad breath. We'll also discuss what you can do about it, because nobody deserves to walk around with a cloud of stink following them.

### The Hidden Dangers Lurking in a Cracked Tooth

Cracked teeth. They sound pretty innocent, right? Just a tiny little fissure, barely visible to the naked eye. Well, think again. These seemingly insignificant cracks can create a haven for all sorts of nasty bacteria. Think of it like a tiny canyon in your mouth, impossible to clean with your toothbrush. Food particles, plaque, and other debris get lodged in these microscopic crevices, becoming a veritable feast for odor-causing bacteria.

### Can a Cracked Tooth Cause Bad Breath? The Connection Explained

So, can a cracked tooth cause bad breath? Absolutely. The link is undeniable. That microscopic grand canyon in your tooth becomes a breeding ground for anaerobic bacteria – little critters that thrive in oxygen-deprived environments. And these little stinkers produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), the primary culprits behind that unpleasant odor emanating from your mouth. These VSCs are the same compounds that give rotten eggs their distinctive smell. Yuck!

### Beyond Bad Breath: Other Symptoms of a Cracked Tooth

Bad breath, or halitosis, isn't the only sign of a cracked tooth. Here are a few other red flags to watch out for:

- **Sensitivity to Temperature:** Does that sip of hot coffee or bite of ice cream send a jolt of pain through your tooth? That’s a classic sign of a crack.
- **Pain When Chewing:** A sharp, localized pain when you bite down could indicate a cracked tooth, especially if the pain is intermittent.
- **Swelling Around the Tooth:** Inflammation around the affected tooth is often a sign of infection, which can occur when bacteria invade the crack.
- **Visible Crack (Sometimes):** While some cracks are so tiny they’re invisible to the naked eye, others are more obvious. Look for hairline fractures or chips in your teeth.

### Diagnosing a Cracked Tooth: What to Expect at the Dentist

Suspect you might have a cracked tooth? Don't try to play dentist at home! It's crucial to see a professional. Your dentist will likely use a combination of methods to diagnose a cracked tooth:

1. **Visual Examination:** They’ll give your pearly whites a thorough once-over, looking for any visible signs of damage.
2. **Dental Explorer:** This pointy little instrument helps your dentist explore the surfaces of your teeth, feeling for any irregularities that might indicate a crack.
3. **Bite Test:** You might be asked to bite down on a special tool. This helps pinpoint the location of the crack and assess the extent of the damage.
4. **X-rays:** Sometimes, cracks are so small they’re not visible on the surface. X-rays can reveal hidden cracks and assess the overall health of the tooth.
5. **Dye Test:** A special dye can be applied to the tooth to help highlight cracks and make them easier to see.

Can a Cracked Tooth Cause Bad Breath? Treatment Options
-------------------------------------------------------

So, what can you do if you’ve got a cracked tooth wreaking havoc on your breath? Fortunately, there are several treatment options available:

### Bonding

For minor cracks, dental bonding can be a simple and effective solution. Your dentist applies a tooth-colored resin to the cracked area, effectively sealing the crack and restoring the tooth’s integrity.

### Crowns

If the crack is more extensive, a dental crown might be necessary. A crown is a custom-made cap that covers the entire tooth, providing strength and protection. Think of it like a little helmet for your tooth!

### Root Canal Therapy

If the crack extends into the pulp of the tooth (the inner chamber containing nerves and blood vessels), root canal therapy might be required. This procedure involves removing the damaged pulp, cleaning the canal, and sealing it to prevent further infection.

### Extraction

In some cases, if the tooth is severely damaged, extraction might be the only option. While nobody *wants* to lose a tooth, sometimes it’s the best course of action to prevent further complications.

Preventing Cracked Teeth: Tips and Tricks
-----------------------------------------

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, right? Here’s how to keep your pearly whites crack-free:

- **Avoid Chewing on Hard Objects:** Ice, hard candy, and even pen caps can put unnecessary stress on your teeth and lead to cracks. Chew gum responsibly.
- **Wear a Mouthguard:** If you play sports, grind your teeth at night, or engage in any activity that puts your teeth at risk, a mouthguard is your best friend.
- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brushing and flossing regularly removes plaque and bacteria, keeping your teeth strong and healthy. Isn't it a good idea?
- **Regular Dental Checkups:** Seeing your dentist regularly for checkups and cleanings is crucial for catching dental problems early, before they become major issues.

### The Takeaway: Don't Ignore That Stink!

""Can a cracked tooth cause bad breath?"" The answer, as we’ve seen, is a resounding yes. A cracked tooth can be more than just a cosmetic issue; it can be a breeding ground for bacteria and a major contributor to halitosis. If you’re experiencing persistent bad breath, along with any other symptoms of a cracked tooth, don’t hesitate to see your dentist. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to preventing further complications and restoring your fresh breath confidence. After all, nobody wants to be known as the person with the dragon breath! Do they?

Bad breath can be a real drag, affecting not only our social interactions but also our self-esteem. While often attributed to easily remedied causes, sometimes the culprit is more complex, like a cracked tooth. This article explored the intricate relationship between cracked teeth and bad breath, elucidating how these seemingly minor fissures can harbor odor-causing bacteria. We discussed the importance of early detection, various treatment options, and preventative measures to maintain optimal oral health. By addressing this often-overlooked source of halitosis, individuals can regain their confidence and enjoy fresher breath.

Today was my day off, decided I would keep myself busy by volunteering myself for a project involving cave digging , something I have never done before. Woke up this morning 5am was hungryyy and told myself to wait till 7 cuz I wanted to spread out my calories throughout the day especially because I was riding with a group of people who might want to go out to eat after so didn’t know exactly what would be happening with my calories. I had planned to bring fruit but didn’t have a solid plan and got out of bed to late to buy anything at the store as I don’t keep anything here unless it needs to be cooked because I’ll eat it. My friend gave me these protein snacks like these chips in smaller than usual bags. Ended up bringing those and sharing them with the others. The whole time the food noise was extremely loud I
 Drank a black coffee and 2 monsters to try to suppress my appetite but I could feel she wanted to eat. Then I ate some of my snacks and the snacks of the others which were not protein snacks but I didn’t go crazy. 700ish calories spent on snacks , at this point I was just thinking I need to go home and have real food before something bad happens. I had the choice to go out and watch the sunset and eat out with some of the people that I rode with but I opted not to , I wanted to stay on track the rest of the day but ended up binging so bad. Binged on the rest of these protein snacks , ate chicken and vegetables with these 2 bags of seeweed and then walked 10 min to the store at 2 bananas a fruit cup of pineapple an apple 2 legendary protein bar 1 quest bar n 1 quest protein donut with a coffee. After feeling sick and laying down I got up and walked 15 to a different store grabbing 2 core power protein shakes and another quest protein bar but didn’t eat it bc I felt to sick at that point.

Asmara, which means united in Tigrinya, and passionate love in Indonesian, is often regarded by western architects, journalists and tourists as as one of the most beautiful cities in Africa.

Situated 2,325 meters (7,628 feet) above sea level, Asmara is home to stylish fashionistas and handsome, tall, charismatic Eritrean men with big beards, who wear fedora hats and tailored three-piece suits crafted by the finest Sicilian hands that Rome has to offer. It is a city where Eritrean gladiators set aside their Kalashnikovs and toothpicks to sweep curly-haired women off their sandals, making their hearts flutter and pitter-patter with each soulful and deep Adulite voices that echo like koboros being struck by stay-at-home aunties.

Asmara is truly a city designed for conversation and human connection. It encourages people to put down their smartphones and defenses, welcoming the opportunity to introduce themselves to a stranger over a cup of coffee. There is no city like it on the dark continent. Asmara remains the epitome of class, romance and elegance.

1hj6c1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hj6c1u/should_i_marry_this_girl_or_not_is_this_love/,Should I marry this girl or not ? Is this love ?,"Should I marry this girl or not ? HELP OUT

So in 2015 (9 years ago – I was 23 at the time she was 26 - she's 4 years older then me) I started seeing this girl that's from my hometown which I knew since I was a kid. I was very attracted to her when I saw her in post office  in summer 2015 so I simply asked her out and our relationship quickly developed. We are both from small town and come from good hardworking families that knew each other.

I will split our „relationship“ in 3 phases.

Phase 1: 2015 – 2020

Phase 2: 2020 – 2024

Phase 3: Present moment - Christmas time 2024

PHASE 1 - So during Phase 1 from my perspective already after few months it was purely sexual relationship while she wanted more and I didn't knew what I wanted/was unsure but definetely wanted sex. Things were going perfectly for the first year (from relationship point of view athough we never defined it as such) but then I started treating her like shit because I wasn't mature enough and wasn't fair twords her ( basically I wasn't man enought). Although we were having sex whole time I was neglecting that we are in relationship, I would be embarassed if she wanted to hold hands in public and I didn't wanted to kiss her in public(this probably happened because she was pushing something i didn't wanted back then)....I was neglecting it because I thought I could find a better one and by better I think the one who's more sexually appealing/looks better ( I know don't judge me ). During this phase I don't put her 1st...I look at myself and my interests more like I would choose to go out on Saturday night with my friend and chase „better ones“ rather then spend movie night with her, I would rather go on summer vacation with my friends to chase girls then to go with her (which of course pissed her off) but whole this time she is quite opposite. She is fully commited, she always puts me 1st and does everything for me. During this phase I had money problems and she's helping me and this one time gives me big sum of money to help me with my problem. She was just perfect partner, supportive, loyal, honest, respectful, kind, great listener like everything a guy could wish for. During my hardest times she was there for me...always. Slowly she's seeing that I'm not serious with her (but she's keeping her hopes and not giving up on me.) All this time I'm telling her that she should move on and find somebody serious. I'm basically telling her what problem I have in my head ( her not being 100% attractive to me/ not seeing her as a 10/10 girl but more like 6/10) and she's telling me that's not importnat looks will fade away anyway bla bla (she was so much mature and smarter then me hah ) but I'm not listening and we're still talking and texting every day, connecting even more, seeing each other as much as we can and of course having seks... during this phase I haven't slept with anyone except her.

Somewhere after 2 years let's say 2017 she found a guy ( later on she told me just to make me jelious) she started dating. I was immediately jelious and possesive, I was „dancing“ around her, I wanted to be with her, I was afraid to loose her and begged her to leave him and after 2 weeks she did leave him and I fall back into my old behaviour – tooking her for granted and seeing her as an option....and of course we continued with sex.

2018,2019,2020 basiclly things are the same...I am still looking/seeking better options which I honestly didn't found...all this time she's waiting for me to become serious...hoping i will marry her …poor girl….and in 2019 event happend which broke her heart. She said she thinks it's the best for us to go no contact and see what will happen to see if I want a relationship or not. We lasted 10 days and I told her I love her and want to be with her. Soon afterwards we rent apartment togather in capital city because I wanted to  get higher paychecks so I could get rid of the debt I had. We were living 2 weeks togather and I remember I was feeling so under pressure and anxious and scared and all those feeling were boiling up inside that I just snaped ( still don't know why – maybe it was debt and me not having money/worrying about paying rent, food etc ) and I choosed to go back home to safety so I told her I can't be with her we should break up(it was stupid sudden rushed eomtional decision). We got back to our hometown and after a week she said she wants to continue being frends because I am her best friend first and foremost and she doesn't want to loose me...here were are continuing to see each other and believe it or not still have sex but not as offten as we would and it was because of me...sometimes i would want it sometimes i wouldn't. This agony continues until 2020 which is phase 2.

PHASE 2 – Somewhere in summer 2020 she changed her job for which she had to travel 30km from our hometown and there she met a guy. She started telling me about him ( you have to understand that this whole time we share everything and we are emotional support there for each other always) of course I got triggered and feeling anxious but I am like okay, I  pretend I don't give a f#ck, still I am there for here and we meet and hang out as much as we can but soon she said that we are finally stopping with seks once and for all and that's when we stoped it completely (when she started fuc#king him). In next 4 years shes fallen in love with this guy (btw he was married with 2 kids) and she is again receiving breadcrumbs (not being fully loved and chosen ) which I told her and for my own selfish reasons wanted her to break up but also for her I am telling her to break it off because  he's not fully commited, she's again just having sexual relationship that now she even has to hide- this guy can't take her even for a coffee but she said I am happy to receive even breadcrumbs from him then not to have that, I would rather have that small part of him then not to have him at all. Her agony continues and I am still there for her although it hurts me she shares everything with me, when they have seks, and all about him. This goes on until beginning of 2024 when she's having hard time on her job and decieds to quit her job and sometimes later move away to capital city  also because she wont see him anymore and wants to break all ties with that guy lets call him Mr D. Now of course she's weak they still see each other after she quit her job here and there and it's because he's forcing it, he comes to our hometown to see her and  it continues for month or two and then she completely decides to stop with seks with him but…. they still talk over phone, btw she often told me that they were talking for hours on phone every day (like 3,4 hours). So summer 2024 she stops with seks with Mr D and tries to move on they talk waaay less on phone then they used to and here's where something interesting happens. Important thing to note although she is  saying and repeating to me that all her romantical feelings towrds me died 4 years ago when I broke up with her in that apartment ladies and gentleman this summer we went to other cities for field trips where she's taking my hand as we're walking and we she also asked me can we kiss, we kissed multiple times and she said she's never felt more attracted to me in her whole life, we'e also done other things…but didn't had seks. I still didn't took the initiative and made the decision to marry her.

PHASE 3 – September this year 2024 she has found great job in capital, moved there and cut 90% of communication with mr D but me and her still communicate every day and see each other over weekend. I am fine, life is going fine and then one day (3weeks ago) she said she met a guy over tinder his name was David. I was a little bit triggered not as i used to was , but she told me that after she said that to Mr. D. she completely cut the communication with her and never heard from him since until this day.  In this phase the crutial moment is when she send me 2 photos of her and David and told me those are nice photos I have dirtier ones. I got triggered like never before again that pattern is waking up inside me that I want her when I can't have her and when shes there I am not appreciating it and bringing it to the next level. I don't know why and how but i immediately dressed in my best and drove 2 hours just so I could  talk 10 min with her ( basically i am just now realizing that i might loose her forever cause I knew married guy wont leave his wife for her which of course he told her but now shit is real this guy is 33, serious and knows what he wants). So we meet went to my car and I basiclly started crying and telling her how of an idiot I was, how much I love her and care about her but didin't realize this all this time). She was very polite told me you were always there for me, even when I suffered because of Mr D, but you are just now realizing what i realized 4 years ago that it's over. I told you all my romantical feelings twords you died 4 years ago and you're talking about options but there are no opption, we will never be togather, it's spilled milk don't cry you never wanted it why are you crying and as I continued to cry and speak i saw she was starting to cry and said i have to go and just walked out of the car. That was last time I was her – it was 10 days ago. When she went out I was screaming and crying …all the emotions went out. I remember driving 2 hours home it was night and I almost crashed 3 times, I was crying the whole way home.

After that I've hired a theraphist because i wanted to understood myself, told her(my love) I am working on myself and she basically said it's to much for her right now and that she'll block me for a little while until she gets better. Next day I wrote her huge letter on whatsapp told her how much of idiot I was and that i am ready to fully commit and everything, send her text to come read that letter on whatsapp. She came read it, told me no reason for her to block me but to respect her decision that she needs some time and space and that we don't communicate for a while except something big happens like someone dies, she also said she thinks I am not accepting the situation and until i do that she's no comfortable with seeing me in person.

MY THOUGHTS:

I think during all this 9 years in the beginning i didn't love her but with time I fall in love with her but mostly thanks to my father bad programming i treated her like shit (like an option that will always be there – same what he does in marriage not showing love and affection) and now I have realized that I will loose her forever. I think took me long time to realize I was in love with her this whole time.

But I still I question myself why didn't I entered relationship 2017 when she tried to made me jelious or when she was single all this time or even when she meet mr D in the beginning why didnt i took initiative ? Why didn't I do it this summer when we were kissing ? Why do I want to do it now again when she's taken ? Is it really just me and my fucked up brain or I have truly changed and learned on my mistakes I can't afford to break her heart ever again ... nor I want that, she deserves to be happy.

I have ..no no she has changed me and made me a better person…I don't care about looks anymore…I want someone like her to spend my life with and I am ready to marry her….I would always choose person like her over some 10/10 girl who has worse character.

Do you think a woman who went through all of that can truly forgive me and again choose me after everything I have done to her ?

Although she said all her romantical feeling for me died 4 years ago why would she kiss and hold hands this summer ? Can a woman truly ever move on if she loved you, mybe it's my ego, mybe it's hope but i do still belive she loves me and cares about me otherwise she wouldn't ask for no contact and time for herself she would say fuck off and block me.

 

PLEASE HELP:

Can we every truly be friends after all that happend ? I assume not because there will always be hopes and we will subconsciously see each other as partners and not friends ? This has to be black or white, no more gray zone.

Is there still chance to save this ?

How do you know should you marry her or not ? have you every question yourself that...when I use reason it makes every sense to marry her....

What's a guarantee to me that I won't repeat the same mistake again ? Have I truly learned my lesson or the same pattern will repeat again...when I get her she will become uninterested to me again :/

It's been 10 days since we haven't seen each other and I've cried every day and miss her a lot....I think I would miss her even 6 months from now...

MY CRAZY PLAN:

I don't know her adress of her appartment in capital city ( i got new phone and number so can't find it out now ) but I know she'll be home for Christmas she told me that..and I am planning to do crazy movie scene and go all in. I am planing to go to her parents house , bring them all gifts, whish them Merry Christmas ( their parents love me as well as her brother and sister) and then ask her to talk with her in her room and tell her everything that is on my heart and give her the offer …tell her look it's now or never babe…everything we're been through has come to this moment…and ask her to marry me ? I will then go and apologiese to her parents for not being serious and mature and done this sooner…if you have better ideas let me know….this is the last option I am left with and I was thinking what to do to make her jaws drop and this definately will do the trick, going there and stating that i love her and choose her and give her ring will be kind of action that not even Mr D did or this new guy David did, that noone did so far…let me know what you guy think of my situation ? I don't wanna do something I will regret but again how can you know...we all learn from our mistakes.

1hj6b8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/1hj6b8m/these_huge_corporations_really_are_killing_all_my/,These huge corporations really are killing all my favorite shops.,"Though I was born in CA, I have lived in Central Oregon since I was 2. I love it here. It's quiet, and remote. It doesn't have the hustle and bustle of bigger cities. I've really loved my rural life. 

I have been watching all my favorite local shops die at the hands of greedy corporations. So many move in and kill all the smaller businesses in the area. Pizza Hut and Dominos came into town, and killed my local Figaro's (god, I want some Figaro's so bad right now). Safeway and Albertson's merged, and my local Erickson's just shut its doors for the last time. Favorite coffee shop, gone. Arcades, gone. Movie stores, gone. (I am only now realizing that Blockbuster came into town, killed our small local store, and then it died too. Goddamn it!)

Obviously the pandemic hit hard, but this has been a slow burn for decades. I have also been a part of the problem. I could no longer afford to keep shopping at the local places, and was barely making ends meet. I really felt like there was nothing I could do, since I needed to save all I could. 

I am finally making an actual living wage now, and I will be doing the best I can to support the local places that I can. I don't order from Amazon anymore, and get my comics and TTRPG books from my local comic shop. I try to eat at locally owned restaurants. 

I guess this post was mostly meant to say, I miss those old shops. I am gonna try what I can to support the ones we have left. ",27,1734772765.0,oregon,6,0.91,False

We've recently came to the combined decision to open the relationship to experience new possibilities. That being said I have no clue what I'm doing. I guess I'll start with some basic info on me. I'm 5 foot 11 and weigh 185 lbs, not fat but not muscular either. I'm disease free and would like to keep it that way. 

Now for some more advanced stuff about me. I have a thing for older women and have a strong desire to have that experience, though I'm not exclusively looking for older women. I'm firm in my sexuality and have never had any kind of homosexual intentions. I don't mind bigger girls although I desire more of a slim or curvy body.

A little info to get to know me. I've lived in NW Ohio 90% of my life. I live fairly close to Lima. I'm a country boy whose been unfortunate enough to get stuck in a city. I love anything outdoors and would rather spend the night by a fire with drinks or driving some back road. I'm currently between jobs as I'm getting my CDL and going to start a new career as a professional driver. I'm very much introverted and struggle with social situations or even simple conversations, it's taken me a half hour to type this much. So if you message me don't ditch me if I'm not holding a good conversation, just kinda nudge me a little. I occasionally visit local bars for a couple drinks but you'll never find me blackout drunk in a public place. Not big on coffee but I enjoy the occasional morning brew and I would very much like to go on a coffee date if given the chance. I'll buy on the first date of course. I consider myself to be a decent person but some people have labeled me as being blunt. I just see no need to waste time with lies or misdirection. I'm a very dedicated person who has goals for my life, and I would like to enjoy a little fun with someone new, even if it's just for a short while. Either way I know it's a lot so I'll just finish with the standard, if I have at all peaked your interest, shoot me a message, would love to chat.

The only ""business"" type projects I had was I forked Google coordinate data for all the buildings in my campus and did a simple analysis to select which building is best to set up a new cafe based on google survey results in an effort to get people to walk more for their cup of coffee.

I’m in Ontario Canada.

I’m considering a BDB with a leaky water spout for 850 CAD (pre-negotiation) vs an Ascaso UNO PID with a malfunctioning steam wand for 750 CAD (pre-negotiation) (steam wand puts out steam just not working correctly)

I make:
1 espresso per day
1 latte per day

Some days it’s 2 espressos
Some days it’s 2 lattes.

I don’t love the build quality of Breville as I’m coming from an Infuser right now.

The main problem I’m aiming to fix is shot inconsistency. My puck prep is dialled, I have a stemless grinder that I think does OK. I only enjoy half my shots. Fresh coffee, stored well, great local roaster. Medium roast.

I’m looking at these machines that need maintenance due to budget constraints.

I also don’t love the look of the Breville, especially compared to the UNO, it’s so gorgeous.

Counter space is fine.

I’d same I’m intermediate at this hobby.

Would love any one to weigh in, really appreciate it guys!

1hj62qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hj62qf/how_long_does_it_take_to_see_results_with/,How Long Does It Take to See Results with Laughland Teeth Whitening?,"If you’re considering **Laughland Teeth Whitening**, one of the first questions you might have is: **how long does it take to see results?** Whitening your teeth can feel like a big commitment, so knowing the timeline helps set realistic expectations. I recently used Laughland for the first time, and I’m here to share my experience.

# The Basics of Laughland Teeth Whitening

Laughland is an at-home whitening kit that uses a **dentist-formulated gel** and an LED mouthpiece to deliver professional-level results. The kit is designed to whiten teeth by up to 7 shades in just six days, which is impressive compared to most other at-home options.

The process is straightforward:

1. Brush and dry your teeth.
2. Apply the whitening gel using the provided applicator.
3. Insert the LED mouthpiece and let it work its magic for 10 minutes.

The promise of visible results in under a week was one of the main reasons I chose to try it.

# When Did I Start Seeing Results?

Here’s a day-by-day breakdown of my experience with Laughland:

* **Day 1**: After my first session, I didn’t notice much of a change. This wasn’t surprising since most whitening products take a few applications to show results.
* **Day 3**: By the third session, my teeth were visibly brighter. The surface stains from coffee and tea started to fade, and my smile looked noticeably cleaner.
* **Day 6**: By the end of the six-day routine, my teeth were significantly whiter—about 7 shades, as advertised. The results looked natural, not overly bright or artificial.

# Factors That Affect Results

While Laughland worked quickly for me, several factors can impact how soon you’ll see results:

1. **Stain Type**: Surface stains from food and drinks are easier to remove than deep discoloration caused by aging or smoking.
2. **Diet**: Drinking coffee, tea, or red wine during the whitening process can slow your progress.
3. **Consistency**: Following the routine every day is key to achieving the best results.

# What Sets Laughland Apart?

One of the reasons Laughland works so quickly is its **LED mouthpiece**, which activates the whitening gel and helps it penetrate deeper into the enamel. The gel is also stored in a **temperature-controlled facility**, ensuring it arrives potent and effective.

I’ve tried other whitening products that took weeks to show minimal results, so Laughland’s six-day promise felt like a breath of fresh air.

# Final Thoughts

If you’re wondering how long it takes to see results with **Laughland Teeth Whitening**, the answer is: not long! By sticking to the daily routine, you can achieve a brighter smile in less than a week. Have you tried Laughland or another whitening product? I’d love to hear about your experiences.

1hj60ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1hj60ag/my_mostly_unpopular_fragrance_collection_and/,My (mostly unpopular?) fragrance collection and reflections,"https://imgur.com/a/WzkRjA4

This is my current fragrance collection. Not the best showcasing picture, but this is how I store them.
I started getting into fragrances when I was about 18, now I’m in my early 40s and this is the current collection. My taste has changed a bit over the years, I made some failed purchases (not owned anymore) and have lost some beloved discontinued ones. But this is the current status, in somewhat order from earliest to latest purchases and by house.

**A La Nuit - Serge Lutens:** My signature scent. This is the best fragrance ever created in my opinion. I can bathe in this day and night everytime of the year. I don’t like to overspray and suffocate everyone in the room, but I think I do that with this one 😂 It’s the most beautiful fresh jasmin, I feel like a jasmin bush when I’m wearing it.

**Sarrasins - Serge Lutens:** Gorgeous jasmin, and compeletely different than A La Nuit. Dark, more daring and seductive. I have days when I think it smells divine and days when I think it smells like horse stable. I don’t know if it’s my nose or skin chemistry causing this. 

**Un Lys - Serge Lutens:** A fresh (sort of?), intoxicating, pollen-heavy (if that makes sense) lily fragrance. Not a lily of the valley, but a lily. Very feminine in my view, it feels like a statement wear fragrance to me. Boss lady floral.

**Santal Blanc - Serge Lutens:** Soft, warm, cozy sandalwood. Staple for winter. Unfortunately discontinued, so I’ll use the rest of the bottle more sparingly.

** Gelsomino Nobile - Acqua di Parma:” Beautiful classy floral. I’m a jasmine lover, and this is one with an extra kick to it because of the red pepper. I only have about 3 sprays left which I’m saving for the perfect occasion. Unfortunately discontinued (why? 😩).

**Alba - Profumum Roma:** Underrated Profumum Roma fragrance. This is a very cozy fragrance I wear in winter, it makes me feel actually warmer for some reason. It’s a fragrance you really wear for yourself, it lasts forever and sits close to the skin (I apply it with the rollerball). 
I tested quite some Profumum Roma fragrances which are popular (e.g. Gioiosa, Dulcis in Fundo, Acqua E Zucchero, Sorriso), but they all had the same very sweet vanilla drydown which I disliked. Alba does not have this at all. I used to have Confetto as well and regret giving it away.

**Molecule 01 - Escentric Molecules:** The only compliment getter in my collection 🙈 I actually don’t like it myself anymore.

**Dama Bianca - Xerjoff:** I have a love/hate relationship with this one. Some days I love it, some days the vanilla is too sweet for me. I also don’t like that it’s described as a wedding scent. I don’t want to smell like something inoffensive that everyone likes (I don’t want to smell offensive and unlikeable either though).

**Aqua Vitae Forte - Maison Francis Kurkdjian:** Love this one for spring and summer. I would describe it as a warm, slightly spicy citrus. The spices make it feel warm to me (vs fresh citrus scents) instead of using vanilla to make it warmer (and sweet), but I also wouldn’t describe it as a very spicy fragrance. It’s not spicy like Christmas spicy, but the Dolce Vita type of spicyness. I hope that makes sense, it’s been a while since I smelled Dolce Vita. When I first wore this, my mom said: “this is YOU.”

**Aqua Universalis - Maison Francis Kurkdjian:** Aaaahhhh… the scent of spring. A lovely lily of the valley fragrance, so uplifting. It’s an easy grab for me when flowers are in bloom outside.

**Aqua Universalis Forte - Maison Francis Kurkdjian:** I received this one as a gift from my boyfriend, as he remembered I enjoyed a sample. I wouldn’t have bought a full bottle myself though, it leans a bit masculine imo. I also only wear this in spring and summer.

Is it just me or do all MFK bottles leak from the spray?

**Akro - Bake:** Lovely lemon pie fragrance. Makes me happy when wearing it. The lemon zest opening is amazing. Doesn’t get too sweet in the drydown, which I appreciate. Although it has good lasting power, I like to respray halfway through the day to experience that opening again.

**Coffee Addict - Theodoros Kalotinis:** Smells exactly like coffee candy. Fun fragrance, but need to be in the mood for it.

**Velvet Chocolate - Theodoros Kalotinis:** Very realistic chocolate milk fragrance. Opens as a chocolate milk, then gets sweeter, but also more cocoa dust-like in the dry down. Also here: I need to be in the mood for it and think it’s more for fall and winter.

**Pistachio Latte - Theodoros Kalotinis:** I was happily surprised by this one. It’s the only pistachio fragrance I tried, so I don’t have any comparisons. Smells just like pistachio ice cream, it puts a smile on my face, feels playful, love it.

These 3 Theodoros Kalotinis fragrances are so different from my mostly floral collection, I like them for the days I want to ‘be crazy’.

**Coco Loco - Superz. Budapest:** I’m on a coconut kick and found this one on a website I was ordering samples from, without knowing anything about it. Immediately fell in love. It’s probably the jasmine though that makes this so intoxicating for me. When I overspray, it actually reminds me a bit of Sarrasins. I’ve since read negative reviews about the brand, but I still love this fragrance, please don’t shoot 🥹

**Fior di Pane - Profumo di Firenze:** I blind bought a full bottle, hoping for a bready fragrance. I don’t get the bread at all, but a lovely floral fragrance which in some way reminds me of the past, but also like something I’ve never smelled before / I cannot place. Yeah, sounds weird, I know 😂 I love it, although it’s very different from my expectations. Makes me feel classy and special when I wear it. I sometimes pick up on the popcorn vibe and when I do, it makes me giddy.

**Panettone - Milano Fragranze:** My latest love. I feel like a millions bucks when I wear this. I especially get the dried fruits and rum and am all here for it. It’s not too sweet in my opinion, I still find it perfumey (which is meant positively). This makes me want to explore boozy fragrances more.

On its way: **Vaniglia del Madagascar - I Profumi di Firenze:** This is a blind buy I’ll be receiving soon. I was looking for a straight up vanilla with some booziness and not overly sweet. Some reviews say it’s exactly that, some say it’s very sweet; I’ll find out soon!

So is this a curated collection? Almost, I think. If I were to curate it, I would remove Molecule 01 and Aqua Universalis Forte.

I hope with showing my collection, it will find some appreciation or people with similar tastes, as I feel like a lot of these are not talked about often / are the less popular fragrances of these houses and in my view deserve so much love.

I truly  appreciate you all. First post.

Tldr: I feel stuck and held hostage by my lack of ability to stay untriggered and stable in the midst of big life changes that I KNOW I would make if I didn't have bp2. Aka How the fuck are bipolar people supposed to get divorced and stay stable. 

Lack of action could become more of a damaging trigger if it builds for too long than making a deliberate, clear decision supported by all the therapists. So it seems better to risk it with a clear head, and not wait and hope it doesn't blow up as a manic volcano at some point in the future. Right?

Long version - 
Married 13 years. Have a stable job that so far I haven't tanked because my co-workers and supervisor are amazing and I'm making strides towards a promotion. Two beautiful kids, one will definitely present with a diagnosis once puberty hits and it has been a journey to put it mildly.

I'm on Lamotrigine 200mg/day. I have mini fluctuations throughout the weeks/months and most of it is tied to sleep levels, diet, hormones, and perception of self-worth. Big events like the election or losing a lot of sleep due to travel, illness, can trigger a long hypo or depressive (angry) episode.

 I still overspend, there are many things I'm not doing right, there are very challenging days parenting young children, I am sensorily overwhelmed at all times except after everyone's asleep, I'm addicted to my phone, etc. And yet my current life would appear to be something of a miracle. 24 years ago I was in the suicide ward and the path to get here is due largely to people in my life showing up for and believing in me. And one of them in particular, normalizing bp2 management akin to managing a physical ailment. I have been in all kinds for therapy for 30 years and I have accomplished a lot of progress. 

So how could I complain? 

Because there is a fundamental part of my primary relationship that does not meet my needs. I need physical contact and he doesn't.  We have been going to great couples therapy for 5 years.  But it appears to be a physiology/psychological thing that doesn't really change, and I have seen clearly for about the last four years that it never will. I'm starving for human touch. This can turn into a massive trigger, possibly the biggest one year over year, when I actually stop and allow myself to feel the void. 

If I were a non bp2 person, this also would be a huge life decision etc. Family upheavel, weighing pros and cons, a very big deal. A friend is currently going through early stages of a respectful divorce, with three kids. It's freaking hard. 

But I do have bp2, maybe adhd, definitely anxiety.

And the voice that keeps ""reasoning"" with me when I notice how deprived my soul and spirit are due to never getting touched except from a masseuse, chiro, dr., etc says to me -- ""Hey!!! Stop it. You have it better here than you could ever find it or manage it out there. Don't fuck this up because you're sad in a sexless (okay, and physical affection-less, and lack of interest in your life, thoughts, feelings, etc) marriage. Do you kids a favor and stop it. This could very well be as good as it gets. Act like it's the fucking Great Depression and be grateful for what you have. You think you can stay stable enough to make it through a healthy divorce/unmarried model, keep your job and shit together, not spiral, and parent lovingly for your amazing kids who desperately need and deserve your ability to connect with them like a loving, trustworthy adult mother?? Are you willing to risk that??""

The answer is no, I don't think I can. 

And the answer is also that I cannot live like this for too many more years. I can feel that is true. I'm a very sexual (even non hypo) person and I adore physical touch, I crave it, I need it. After 13 years, well, at some point I won't be able to continue. 

I started drinking coffee again this week, which triggers hypo thinking for me. So I decided I need another baby. With or without the husband's help. Yeah great idea. Our finances are a mess, largely courtesy of my impulse spending. 

Clearly I am needing real intimacy and a baby is hypo me's solution. When having my first two kids I went off lamotrigine and I had a LOT of support and leeway. Doing it by myself or forcing a baby on the marriage? Not a good idea. Not fair to anyone, least of all bringing a human being into the world because I'm starving for intimacy. 

So. I think I need to start laying the groundwork for becoming more functional than ever, more stable, better therapist, etc. And be very very careful and very very calm and very very deliberate. And have a buddy whom I can confide in about bp2 and my marriage. And the plan. Who can help me when shit falls apart. 

Does this sound like the right idea?

The steps I take are:
1 - grind finer than a regular shot
2 - lift the lever up all the way and observe the bottom basket, once you see coffee about to come out reduce the lever half way only.
3 - hold in this position for around 10 - 12 seconds. I'm not too concerned about the amount of coffee that comes out, it can be as much as 3 or even 4g
4 - pull level back up until you get your desired weight.
5 - total shot time could be anywhere from 35 - 45 seconds.

I find this results in a much more balanced shot. Especially with medium/dark beans which my wife prefers. I'm a total convert though.

1hj5oqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hj5oqg/do_hydrogen_water_bottles_work_my_experience_with/,Do Hydrogen Water Bottles Work? My Experience with the LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle,"When I first heard about **hydrogen water bottles**, I thought, “Is this really necessary? Isn’t water just water?” But after reading about the potential benefits of hydrogen-infused water, I decided to test it out for myself. That’s how I ended up using the **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle**, and here’s what I’ve learned so far.

# What is a Hydrogen Water Bottle?

The **lifewater hydrogen bottle** is not just a fancy reusable bottle—it’s a tool that uses advanced technology to infuse molecular hydrogen into your water. Through a process called electrolysis, it separates water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, venting out the oxygen while leaving behind hydrogen-rich water.

Hydrogen water is said to:

* **Boost hydration** by helping water absorb more effectively into your cells.
* **Fight inflammation** with antioxidant properties.
* **Support energy and focus** by improving cellular health.
* **Improve recovery** after workouts.

In short, it promises to take something you already do—drink water—and make it even better for your body.

# My Experience with the LifeWater Bottle

I’ve been using the **lifewater water bottle** for a few weeks now, and while I was skeptical at first, I’ve noticed some subtle but real changes:

1. **Hydration**: I feel like the water “sticks” better. I don’t get that dry-mouth feeling even after a long day, and I’m not constantly refilling my bottle.
2. **Energy**: My afternoons have felt more productive, with fewer energy slumps. I still love my coffee, but I don’t *need* it as much.
3. **Skin**: My skin feels softer, and a few small blemishes cleared up faster than usual.

# Do Hydrogen Water Bottles Work?

From my experience, I’d say yes—but don’t expect miracles. The **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle** hasn’t transformed my life overnight, but it’s made a noticeable difference in how I feel day to day. For something as simple as drinking water, that’s pretty impressive.

# Who Might Benefit from It?

I think the **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle** is especially useful for:

* **Fitness enthusiasts**: Better hydration and faster recovery after workouts.
* **People with inflammation**: It could help with conditions like arthritis or muscle soreness.
* **Anyone looking for subtle energy boosts**: It’s a natural way to stay more alert and focused.
* **Skin health seekers**: The antioxidant properties might contribute to clearer skin.

# The Pros and Cons

**What I Liked:**

* Easy to use—just fill, press a button, and wait three minutes.
* Portable and durable, with no leaks.
* No filters to replace or extra maintenance required.

**What Could Be Better:**

* The price is higher than a regular bottle, but the technology justifies it.
* The base needs charging every few days, which could be inconvenient for heavy users.

# Final Thoughts

So, **do hydrogen water bottles work?** Based on my experience with the **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle**, I’d say they do—but the benefits are subtle rather than life-changing. If you’re someone who’s already mindful of your hydration or looking for a wellness upgrade, it’s definitely worth a try.

1hj5h61,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1hj5h61/looking_for_advice_on_my_workout_routine_to/,Looking for advice on my workout routine to achieve a more feminine body shape. Any suggestions for adjustments or improvements?,"I’ve been focusing entirely on cardio for the past 3 months and was wondering if burning 400 calories a day, 4 days a week, is a good amount? My food intake isn’t super big—usually a breakfast burger with chips and some tea or coffee, plus another meal later in the day around lunchtime or dinner. I’ve been losing weight (12 kg so far, from 132 to 120), but I really want to lose my slight belly bump. It’s going down, but the area around my lower belly and the sides just above my hips is still the most dysphoric for me right now along with my neck and chin area still having a slight bit of fat.



Here’s my current routine:

20 minutes of cycling: burns about 185 calories

20 minutes of arm cycling: burns about 115 calories

20 minutes of walking on the treadmill: burns around 100 calories

100 jumping jacks: added in daily

Sometimes, if I’m feeling brave, I also do some squats.



I’d love to hear thoughts on whether I’m on the right track or if there’s anything I can tweak!",2,1734768873.0,MtF,0,1.0,False

I recently bought a Bialetti Moka Pot in France (in the Leclerc supermarket) in open packaging which allows you to see and touch the coffee maker.
Do you know?
Does anyone have any info on this open packaging?

Thank you so much.",2,1734768620.0,mokapot,1,0.75,False
