Yeaaaaaaah happy us !



I got diagnosed with AS this year, after a year and a half of waking up out of pain in the middle of the night.

My AS is not the worse. I'm not in pain all the time, only during the nights, and the pain itself is managable. I'm able to move as I used to, the only digestive problems I have come from not taking my meds properly.... in that bucket of people who drew the short straw, I am one of the lucky few, so far. I have friends struggling with chronic disease way worse than mine.



That being said.



Legend has it that AS can move through periods of pain and periods of remission. I don't know about you people, but mine has been constant, for 2 years. I think I don't need all of my fingers to count the normal nights of sleep I've had in the last years.

Even when I was in my 20s, I needed 6 to 7h of sleep per night minimum. Never did the old ""going out all night and then going to class"", always had to take care of my sleep.



Now add 10 years and 2 years of chronic lack of sleep.

Today was the third day in a row that I could only sleep 5h. Even after I postponed work, to get some rest, and spend an entire afternoon in bed, did my fucking physio exercices properly, I still woke up exhausted, earlier than my alarm, and had to cancel yet another full day of work.



I have no idea if I'll be able to work tomorrow. 

I have no idea if I can make plans for this week-end. 

I have no idea if I'll be able to reschedule coffee with that friend I already stood up twice because I was too tired to meet up.



People say ""take care of yourself"". But that's not me I'm taking care of, when I'm staying in bed instead of meeting with my patients, going to singing class, getting coffee, going on a date with that cute guy. Those are the things I do to take care of myself. Those are the things I can't do because I'm taking care of something else.



I'm taking care of the fucking disease. 

I'm taking care of the fucking fatigue that won't leave me alone. 



I am.

so.

Fucking.

1pk4l2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1pk4l2y/method_i_deleted_my_old_life_and_became/,[METHOD] I deleted my old life and became unrecognizable,"

Two months ago I deleted every single app from my phone, uninstalled every game from my PC, and blocked every website that was eating my life. Everyone thought I was being dramatic.

Today is day 69. And I’m a completely different person.

I’m 22. For the past three years I’ve been what you’d call “chronically online.” My entire existence was digital. Wake up, check phone, scroll TikTok for an hour in bed, move to my computer, browse Reddit, watch YouTube, play games, order food through apps, scroll more, sleep at 4am, repeat.

I had a part-time remote job doing data entry that I could barely focus on. Would take me 8 hours to do 2 hours of work because I was constantly alt-tabbing to check Discord, Twitter, YouTube. Got warnings multiple times about missing deadlines.

My real life was basically nonexistent. Hadn’t hung out with anyone in person in over a year. Hadn’t been to a store in months (everything delivered). Hadn’t had a real conversation that wasn’t through a screen. Just lived in this digital bubble where nothing felt real.

The thing is, I wasn’t even enjoying it. Wasn’t having fun gaming or scrolling. Was just… existing. Passing time. Avoiding the real world because the digital world was easier and more comfortable.

## The moment that changed everything

Two months ago I was on a video call with my mom (because I never visited her in person even though she lives 30 minutes away). She asked if I wanted to come over for dinner that weekend.

I said I was busy. Automatic response. Wasn’t actually busy. Just didn’t want to leave my apartment.

She got quiet for a second then said “You know, I barely know you anymore. We only talk through screens. When was the last time I saw you in person? Six months ago?”

I realized she was right. Six months. I’d been so absorbed in my digital life that I’d gone six months without seeing my own mother who lives 30 minutes away.

She said “Sometimes I worry you’re going to disappear into your computer and I’ll never get you back.”

That hit me hard. The idea that I was disappearing. That I was choosing pixels over real human connection with the person who raised me.

After that call I looked around my apartment. Clothes I’d ordered online. Food wrappers from deliveries. My computer setup. My phone within arm’s reach. Everything optimized for never having to leave or interact with the real world.

I realized I’d built a prison and was calling it comfort.

That night I made a decision. I was going to force myself back into the real world by removing every digital escape route I had.

## What I did

The next morning I deleted every app from my phone except calls, texts, maps, and banking. Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Discord, Reddit, YouTube, all gone.

Uninstalled every game from my PC. League, Valorant, everything. Deleted my accounts so I couldn’t easily come back.

Blocked every time-wasting website using Reload (found it on Reddit before deleting Reddit). Set it to block social media, YouTube, news sites, everything from 7am to 10pm.

Canceled all my delivery app subscriptions. Deleted Uber Eats, DoorDash, all of it. If I wanted food I’d have to go get it.

The goal was simple: make digital escapism physically impossible, force myself to live in the real world.

## The first two weeks were terrifying

Not exaggerating, it was genuinely scary. I’d reach for my phone dozens of times per day out of pure habit and there’d be nothing to open. Would try to browse Reddit and it’d be blocked. Would think about playing a game and remember I’d deleted everything.

First few days I just sat there. Didn’t know what to do with myself. My brain didn’t know how to exist without constant digital stimulation.

Day 3 I almost gave up and reinstalled everything. Sat there with the app store open, finger hovering over Instagram. Stopped myself by thinking about my mom saying “I’m scared I’ll never get you back.”

Day 5 I forced myself to go to an actual grocery store. First time in months. Felt overwhelming. Too many people, too much sensory input. Was in and out in 10 minutes.

Day 8 I went to a coffee shop to work instead of staying home. Sat there with my laptop feeling anxious and out of place. But I stayed for two hours.

Day 12 I drove to my mom’s house unannounced. She looked shocked when she opened the door. We had dinner together. Real dinner, at a table, talking. First time in six months.

## Week 3-4: Starting to adapt

Week three was when things started shifting. My brain was starting to accept that the digital escape routes weren’t coming back.

Started going to the gym (actual gym, not home workouts). Felt awkward at first but stuck with it. Went 4 times that week.

Started cooking actual meals because I had to. Couldn’t just order food anymore. Turns out cooking is kind of meditative when you’re not trying to watch YouTube while doing it.

Started reading books. Physical books. Could barely focus for 10 minutes at first. By week four was reading for 30-40 minutes at a time.

Most importantly, started existing in physical spaces. Coffee shops, parks, stores, my mom’s house. Forcing myself to be around real people even if I wasn’t talking to them.

## Week 5-8: Becoming human again

This is when I started feeling like an actual person again instead of a consciousness trapped in a digital world.

Joined a climbing gym. Started going three times a week. Made small talk with a regular there. Eventually started climbing with him. First real friend I’d made in years.

Got promoted at work because I was actually focused and hitting deadlines. Boss said my productivity had “dramatically improved.”

Started visiting my mom once a week for dinner. We’d cook together and talk. She said I seemed “more present” than I’d been in years.

Met a girl at the climbing gym. We got coffee. Went on an actual date. Second date is this weekend. Never could’ve done this when I was glued to screens 16 hours a day.

## Where I am now (day 69)

I wake up at 7:30am without an alarm. This was impossible two months ago when I was sleeping until noon.

I work my full hours actually focused. Get everything done in 4-5 hours instead of dragging it across 8-10 hours.

I go to the gym 5 times a week. I’ve gained visible muscle. People have commented on it.

I read every night for 30-45 minutes before bed. I’ve read 5 books in two months.

I cook almost all my meals. I’ve learned like 15 recipes. Actually enjoy the process now.

I see my mom once a week. We have real conversations. She says she has her son back.

I have 2 real friends I see in person regularly. We climb together, get food, actually hang out. Not just Discord voice calls.

I’m dating someone. We go on actual dates. Do things together in the real world. It feels surreal after years of only existing digitally.

Most importantly, I don’t feel like I’m disappearing anymore. I feel present. I feel real. I feel like I’m actually living instead of just existing in a digital space.

## What I learned

Digital life isn’t inherently bad, but when it becomes your entire life, you disappear. You become a consciousness in a digital space and your physical body just maintains itself barely enough to survive.

You can’t moderate your way out of digital addiction when you’re that deep. You have to remove it completely and force your brain to rewire.

The real world is uncomfortable at first after years of digital comfort. That’s normal. Push through the discomfort.

Physical presence matters. Being in the same room as someone. Making eye contact. Having conversations without screens between you. You forget how important this is when you live digitally.

Your brain will adapt if you force it to. First two weeks are hell. Week three is manageable. Week five you start feeling human. Week eight you wonder why you ever lived differently.

## If you’re disappearing into digital life

Remove everything at once. Half measures don’t work. You can’t “just use social media less” when your brain is wired for it. You have to remove it completely and rewire.

Use tools like Reload to physically block access. Your willpower will fail. External enforcement won’t.

Force yourself into physical spaces. Coffee shops, gyms, parks, anywhere. Just exist around real people even if you don’t interact at first.

Find physical activities that require presence. Climbing, cooking, reading physical books, anything that makes you exist in the real world.

Focus on today. Can you go today without opening social media? Yes. Can you go today without gaming? Yes. Tomorrow ask again.

Accept that it will be uncomfortable. You’re reversing years of conditioning. That takes time and feels bad at first.

The first two weeks are brutal. But temporary discomfort is better than permanent disconnection from reality.

## Final thought

69 days ago I was disappearing into my computer. My mom barely knew me. I had no real friends. No real life. Just digital existence.

Today I’m back in the real world. I have friends. I’m dating someone. I see my mom weekly. I’m present in my own life.

Two months. That’s all it took to go from digital ghost to actual human being.

Two months from now you could be living in reality again. Or you could still be disappearing into screens, just two months older.

Your choice. Delete everything. Start today.

I’m rooting for you.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1765476776.0,Habits,0,1.0,False

Hi all,

I recently acquired a ton of dried P. som pods and stems that I wish to perform a calcium morphenate extraction but I can’t for the life of me get it to precipitate out of solution. I’m following BigD extraction tek. Here are the steps I took:

1: Create PPT - grind up the pods and stems into a fine powder using a blender and coffee grinder. Tossed into a pot with 2L of purified water. Added 100g of paraffin wax (as the tek calls for to defat the tea) and mixed in then let it simmer for a few hours. Cool down and leave in the fridge for 24 hours. I strained the plant material to extract every bit of tea. Poured the refined tea into a pot and reduced, the tea became a very dark color. 

2. Separation - Once reduced by 1/4 volume, I added calcium hydroxide with vigorous stirring until the solution resembled a brown “Bailey’s Cream Liquor” color. Let it cool and placed into the fridge for 24 hours to allow the layers to separate. The tek states there should be 3 layers but I only observed 2; a semi translucent iced tea colored liquid and a sludgy layer on the bottom. I carefully separated both by decanting the top and discarded the precipitated layer on the bottom. The pH of the CaOH containing solution is 11-12.  

3. Precipitation of Cal Mor - BigD’s write up calls for ammonia hydroxide, which may be wrong because NH3 only raised the pH instead of lowering to the targeted 9.1. I think the chemist meant ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). Again, I maybe wrong and this is where the experiment failed. Please let me know. 
Once the solution reached room temperature, I incrementally kept adding small amounts of ammonium chloride, stirring and waiting 5 minutes before taking a pH reading. I used 2 different pH meters for better accuracy. Once I reached 9.1, I stopped and let the beaker sit for 2 hours. Nothing precipitated. I moved it to the fridge to cool down and no change. From then, I slowly added more NH4Cl and waited until eventually reaching a pH of 8.5. The calcium morphenate never precipitated. 

What am I doing wrong? Now I’m left with 2 beakers and no product. Is there anyway of recovering or fixing this? Or is this just ruined? I’m sure the alkaloids are still in this solution, I just don’t know what to do. I’m at a loss now.

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",1,1765476765.0,THYZOID,0,1.0,False

I never used trains, drones are the best!   

Phase 4 was the hardest by far   

I tried nuclear but couldn't make the cleanup supply chain work well, so I stuck with rocket fuel, I never got above 15,000MW and it wasn't a huge problem (although I probably could have done phase 5 quicker if I had more).    

The hard drives are an absolute game changer, I wish I knew that 50hrs ago.   
 
My factory in the basin in the south West produced basically all of my end game products. It's a goldmine.   

I never used the trucks, but I built some roads and had a blast driving the explorer back and forth to my different factories. I don't think it gets enough love.

She has been best friend with Tek (fake name) for years, to the point that Tek has been to her grandparents with her on holidays.

Tek also got into a relationship with a guy I'll call Thomas(M**21**). That is about a month before we did. Let's just say Thomas is a bad boyfriend. I'll give you all a list of ""red flags"" about Thomas.

* he has 3 exes, and got all of them addicted to hard drugs before leaving them because of their addiction
* he cheats on Tek with his own best friend Ted
* last Christmas, Thomas didn't give a gift to Tek under the pretence he ""doesn't believe in Christmas"". He did however gift everyone in their friend group expensive and personalized gifts. He was already an asshole less than 6 months in their relationship.
* Although Thomas is dating a Trans Man, he is only romantically attracted to women. This means he asks Tek to dress like one when they go out together.
* Thomas is both an alcoholic and addicted to drugs. Meaning, the man was drunk or high for about 7 out of the 10 interactions I had with him. Also means that he HAS to go out to drink every evening, no matter how his boyfriend Tek is.
* while they were protesting, Thomas took Tek's key and left him in the middle of the street, dressed entirely in black because policemen came with tear gas. Tek cannot physically run and was in a protest for the first time ^((while looking like a gigantic cop target on Thomas's wise advice))
* **Thomas has hit Tek in the past, more than once.**
* **Thomas often berates Tek violently by text or by screaming on him**
* **Tek has tried killing himself over Thomas being an asshole. Thomas told him ""not to"" then went out by himself to drink with his friends.**
* **2 months after their initial breakup, Tek was still being friendly with Thomas, giving him the keys to his apartment so he could ""do his laundry"". This ended with Thomas threatening Tek from his place violently by text and me having to go out of my way to come over with my girlfriend and be muscle to kick Thomas out.**

*(might be important to note GF has been trying to get Thomas and Tek to break up since about 4 months in their relationship, so when they did break up we were definitely glad.)* 

after that last ""factoid"" we thought we'd never hear of the guy again, at least hoped so, I kicked him out you know. And even though he only got a slight slap on the back of the neck,  I apparently ""beat the shit"" out of him. He wanted to sue me...

Except about 10 days ago, a common friend of my girlfriend and Tek saw Tek and Thomas having a little ""coffee date"" and told my girlfriend. GF absolutely (and understandably if you ask me) flipped out and asked Tek ""what the fuck are you doing with Thomas"" (word for word). 

And Tek took it super badly: he yelled at my GF by call and then sent her a text about it ""not being highschool anymore"" and how it's not her business ""managing"" his relationships.  
My GF took some time off before answering, and then she uninvited him from her family Christmas (Tek was invited as his family is kinda transphobic)  
([screenshot of the text](https://imgur.com/a/naoCCy0))

Since then, it's basically been the Cold War, both of them are shunning each other, and it's causing my girlfriend to feel constantly bad about it. I haven't been talking to Tek either, even if we somewhat talked here and then. And I just want my girlfriend to get her best friend back.

If it was one of my mates I'd definitely have a big talk with the guy, but fact of the matter is, he's more my GF's best friend than a friend of mine (logical). He hasn't told our friend group he got back with Thomas (probably out of shame) and I wouldn't know if not for my girlfriend.

Tonight, my girlfriend realized Tek had ""restricted"" her off Instagram, their main way to text.

TL,DR: My (m19) girlfriend (F19) is having trouble with her best friend (M18) who is going back with his abusive boyfriend (M21)

What that actually meant in practise was that I was the one who got the boring, stressful jobs and he got the praise. When dad left, I was the one going with mom to appointments, translating paperwork, dealing with bills, while my brother showed up on holidays, took cute pics with mom for Instagram and got called ""such a good son"". It annoyed me, but I told myself whatever, at least she is taken care of. Fast forward to this year. Mom had a small surgery that turned into more complications than they expected, so suddenly there were meds schedules, follow up visits, insurance calls, all that fun stuff. My brother ""works long hours"" at a tech job and lives 20 minutes away from her. I live 5 minutes away and my job is more flexible, so guess who they automatically decided would handle literally everything. Spoiler, not the golden child. 

For months I have been the one taking mom to every check up, sitting in waiting rooms, arguing with pharmacy people about generic meds, chasing down doctor offices that never call back. I made spreadsheets to keep track of what she takes when, I cleaned her apartment after the surgery, I took time off  work so she wouldnt be alone after a bad reaction. My brother swung by twice with takeout and flowers. Cue mom telling everyone ""he is working so hard and still finds time for his poor old mother"" while I am apparently just the person who ""has more free time anyway"". When I tried to bring it up and say I needed help, she got upset and said I was ""keeping score"" and making things awkward. Last week it all came to a head when she called me at 6 am because she had lost a prescription. I was exhausted, told her she needed to ask my brother for once, and she literally said ""you know he gets stressed, you handle these stuff better"". I snapped and said ""yeah because I have been forced to handle it since I was 12, maybe he can learn now"". She cried, then later texted that I was being cruel to both her and my brother. He also texted me some nonsense about how I was ""dumping my resentment"" on them and that he never asked to be compared. 

Now I feel like I am at a crossroads. Part of me wants to keep helping because she is my mom, and I know dealing with doctors is scary for her.  Another part of me wants to pull back hard and let them see what happens when the ""strong one"" actually stops being on call 24-7. A friend suggested I set a strict schedule, like I will take mom to appointments on X day, but if she needs rides or calls outside that, she needs to ask my brother or figure out transport. I already feel guilty just typing that, which probably says alot about the dynamic here.

But I get these episodes where the symptoms get so intense it's hard to walk and I feel weak as if I were drugged. I also get very thirsty despite drinking lots of water. I also have to urinate frequently. I do sprinkle Real Salt and No Salt on my food for electrolytes, as well as take Magnesium at night.


My diet is quite good. Been doing AIP for 5 or 6 weeks now and lost ~10 or so lbs. I wasn't very overweight to begin with and have a good amount of muscle. I've been gluten free for years now and lactose free for awhile too. I don't eat candy or sweets (maybe a very rare gluten free treat), no soda (not even diet), no coffee, etc. Basically meat, fruit, vegetables, and protein shakes (unflavored beef protein - it's AIP compliant).


 I do strength training 3 or 4 times per week, walk the dog a mile a few times per week (depends on weather), get 5k steps per day (I work in an office so this is difficult sometimes), and run around with my toddler. I also do all of the yardwork during the normal months in NY.


No doctor can figure out my issues. But from what I'm reading it could be reactive hypoglycemia. I've had my A1C checked and it's fine, but now I'm reading that's not a good indicator since it's just a snapshot essentially. I've used a home glucose meter a couple of stints, but it always came back good (usually around 100). I don't think I've ever had a legit CGM.


Earlier this year I was taking Metformin from my TRT clinic. It helped with some weight loss but I didn't feel a difference, or at least benefit. I was still thirsty and urinating a lot with my good water intake. I went from 500mg to 1000mg per day (all ER) and felt good for a day or two. Then I started feeling so, so awful. Super lethargic like I could barely stand at times. Super thirsty, drinking water and it'd help for literally a few minutes, and I was urinating very frequently. Of course the worst day I had jury duty and literally had to excuse myself during an important part because I had to go so bad despite going multiple times already in the lobby area. In retrospect I should have went to a hospital... I think it dropped my blood sugar way too low. And this happens daily, but maybe a bit less intense.


I'm going to see an Endocrinologist in January. This was recommended by a Hematologist. I'm hoping to get a CGM and whatever other tests done.


On another note, I did get glucose tablets to see if they helped and I am feeling they do. They're True Plus glucose tablets. 4 tablets is 15g fast acting carbs.",1,1765476546.0,Hypoglycemia,0,1.0,False

I’m going to have such a big tantrum today. A big *fucking* tantrum even (because the tantrum is going to be so big that it justifies the use of vulgarity to emphasize its magnitude). I’m kind of excited. 

Last month my mom and Principal Gildseth and Vice Principal Dwinel all decided that I needed to take a bunch of tests to check if I have autism or ADHD or whatever (which are retard diseases). I went into the test and I did very well on all of the questions and got them all right which made me think that I had proven how much of a retard I wasn’t. Oh, what a fool I was. It turns out my answers to the questions were right in a way that indicated that the thought processes that brought me to the correct solutions were highly divergent (retarded). I should’ve just gotten the answers wrong, like an idiot. That would’ve been the non-retarded thing to do.

I scan Mr. Peters’ room. My goal for my tantrum today is to cause significant property damage. That will make this tantrum bigger and more important than all of my previous tantrums because there is going to be a specific number of U.S. dollars that this tantrum is going to cost. I will need to wait until Mr. Peters is away from his desk to strike. Mr. Peters is a pretty big guy (well, he’s fairly average in height, but he’s quite muscular (presumably because of football experience, as evidenced by the football trophies he often displays)). He is almost certainly strong enough to physically prevent me from smashing his computer tower. I will require haste.

Next week I’m supposed to be starting a new schedule. I will be attending Mr. Peters’ homeroom, as normal. I will also be in the normal math and social studies classes, but then some of my classes will be the retard ones. One of them is reading, for some reason, which doesn’t make sense to me because I’m very good at reading because I know a far greater number of big words (such as entomological, oviparous, hymenoptera, and ametabolous) than my average peer. Another is language arts, which causes me similar confusion for many of the same reasons. I will be pulled out of gym (which is just as well, because Mrs. Meyer’s done nothing but force me to run since the start of the year), and instead of the foreign language classes I will be going to Mrs. Ziebarth’s home ec room, which will apparently be “a space for self-directed learning.” 

This is all the worst thing in the world. Once you go into special ed, everyone knows you’re in special ed, and are therefore retarded. My mom is very stupid for thinking that this change will positively impact my social development. No one will ever want to be my friend once I am retarded, and I won’t want to be friends with the kids in the retard classes because of how retarded they are. I will always be alone. 

Mr. Peters is getting up to walk to Katie’s desk. He’s probably going to ask her if she did all her homework last night. She probably didn’t. This is going to be as good a chance as any.

Nothing matters anymore. It didn’t matter that I didn’t have a tantrum all year (except that time in the theater, which doesn’t count because it wasn’t at school). I can follow all the rules, I can remember to bring a pencil to all my classes, I can permanently abstain from running in the hallway, and it will never ever matter, because I’m me. Everything always ends up the same way, and that way is always bad. I suppose I could still be expelled permanently, but like, *oh no*, I don’t get to go to *middle school* anymore? The *humanity*!

I know who my enemy is, and it isn’t Mr. Dwinel, and it isn’t TJ Feyerhaus, and it isn’t Mr. Peters, and it sure as hell isn’t Philip. It’s the universe. The universe has always conspired against me. It has always gone out of its way to make me feel like shit. And if it’s God that decides I’m a piece of shit, who’s more likely to be right, me or God? What’s another tantrum? What’s a million more tantrums? It’s not going to change anything. Nothing changes anything, ever.

I scream with every vessel in my lungs, louder than loud, a Philipesque roar. They all turn to look as I stand and I run towards the desk. Mr. Peters is chasing me now. Should I jump over the desk or go around it? Jumping over the desk would be the cooler thing to do, to be sure, but I am afraid that ever since I was forsaken by the Bass God, my hops have often failed me. If I am to succeed, I need to go around. I dart behind the desk, and now I’m holding the computer tower above my head. 

Mr. Peters jumps over the desk and pulls the computer straight from my hands. Then he grabs me by the back of my shirt. I writhe and hit and scratch, but it is (as could be expected from his muscliness) fruitless.

“Folks, it appears that Colin is having a disruptive mental health episode,” says Mr. Peters. “I’m going to host an emergency guidance session with him in my guidance office. Jimmy, can you please go to Mrs. Ziebarth’s homeroom and fetch Harvey? He gets to supervise y’all while I’m out.”

He drags me towards the door, and I’m still fighting him. As he opens the door, Katie gives me a look that, if I were to describe it with all its features in minute detail, would read as fairly normal, but is, upon looking at it, obviously weird.

Mr. Peter’s guidance office is on the other side of the school as his health classroom and it’s going to be a pretty long walk to the office. I was unable to destroy the computer and cause monetary damage to Greenwood Middle School, but maybe I can still make this my biggest tantrum ever if I make it the tantrum where I hit a teacher the most times. I am already several dozen smacks above my previous record of zero, but I’m sure this long walk will give me the opportunity to rack up an even higher score. Hit hit hit hit hit hit hit.

“Morning, Lance,” says Mr. Dwinel as he passes, sipping from a paper coffee cup. “I see you’re having a busy morning.”

“Just the usual, Gary,” says Mr. Peters. “Honestly, I don't think the kid’s heart’s really in it. Should I give a call to Linda?”

“Call his mother over *this*?” says Mr. Dwinel. “Nah. File a report with Nancy, Linda will read about it at the parent-teacher conference. Hell, you gave me more trouble than that back in your day.” That’s really insulting. No, call Mom about this tantrum, it’s my biggest tantrum ever. I hit Mr. Peters even harder, and it just does just as much nothing.

“Ha. Remember when you moved your office into the basement so you could monitor ol’ Makeout City better?” says Mr. Peters.

Mr. Dwinel lets out a hearty chuckle. “Yes! Makeout City, oh that takes me back. When was that? Ninety-four?”

“Thereabouts, yeah.”

“Ugh, don’t remind me of that year,” laughs Mr. Dwinel. “Spider flu was going about like *crazy*. *So* much paperwork. Well, carry on. Do whatcha gotta do.”

“Bye, Gary,” says Mr. Peters. 

Hmmm. This tantrum isn’t going at all as I had it planned. It appears that my rage regarding my reassignment to the retard classes is not being taken seriously by the teachers or the administration. 

Perhaps there is still time. After all, Mr. Peters has another computer in his office. Maybe if I stop hitting Mr. Peters now, I will be in a better position to go for his computer in a surprise attack. Yes, that’s it. I let my hands go limp.

“Ha,” says Mr. Peters. “Getting tired, kid?”

Yes. He’s taking the bait. 

He lets me go when we’re outside his office. He unlocks the door then grabs me again and tosses me into his office. I need to land on my feet or else I won’t be in a good position to go for the computer. Oh, I guess that’s a bust. I’m on the floor now.

Mr. Peters towers over me. “Get up, kid,” he says.

Maybe I shouldn’t get up, actually, because he’s telling me to stay on the floor and it’s a bigger tantrum if I'm disobeying.

“Or don’t. Not like I give a shit.” Oh, I’m definitely getting up now. I stand. Mr. Peters laughs.

“You know what I find so funny about you, Colin?” says Mr. Peters. “You think everyone’s so *mean* to you. You think you’re the *victim* here. You’re the kid who screams and cries and hits when he doesn’t get his way, and then you look around at everyone else, and think, *what a bunch of bullies*. Come on, bro. You have it easy. The rest of the world is doing you a kindness by not putting you in your goddamn place every goddamn day. So, the question is, uh, what am I supposed to do with this kid, huh?”

I am confused by the question; I am presumably the “this kid” in question, but Mr. Peters is referring to me in third person, and not in second person. Then, I realize he’s not talking to me. He’s looking at the dreamstalker spider nestled on his bookshelf.

“Really, dude? Ya think so?” Peters says to the spider. “Give him a chance? I mean, I *guess* that would be a *little* more fun. Well, you’re the boss.”

“Mr. Peters?” I say. “Why are you talking to the spider?”

Mr. Peters turns back towards me. “Talking to a spider? You sound crazy, bro. You sound insane. You need to seriously get a grip, so you know what? You wanna see what it’s like in the real world? You wanna know how real men react when they meet a twerp like you?” He raises his fists. “Come on, Hannigan, it’s gotta be a fair fight. Get into position.”

What is he saying? Is he trying to fight me? Teachers aren’t allowed to hit kids. Kids aren’t allowed to hit teachers, either, but teachers *really* can't hit kids. Books can fall up, and you can survive getting chainsawed hollow so long as you’re subsequently filled with crows. But it’s absolutely, definitively against the rules for teachers to hit kids.

“I’m giving you a chance, Colin,” says Mr. Peters. “If you don’t take it, that’s on you. Raise your fists. Feet at shoulder width. Come on now.”

No. This doesn’t make sense. Teachers aren’t allowed to hit kids. I can’t raise my arms to fight him because it wouldn’t make sense because this isn’t happeni–

**POW**

I’m on the floor again. No. I’m dreaming. Not like normal, like I’m actually dreaming, like at night. Mr. Peters didn’t hit me because teachers aren’t allowed to hit kids.

And I’m on my feet again but I don’t remember getting up. Mr. Peters is holding me by my hair, which must be his way of helping me back up.

**BANG**

“HELP! Colin Hannigan’s going crazy!”

**BANG**

“COME HERE! He’s banging his head on the wall!”

**BANG**

“I can’t control him! There’s blood everywhere! Please help!”

**BANG**

I’m on the floor again now, bleeding all over Mr. Peters’ carpet. I need to get up. Mr. Dwinel swings the door open. 

“Jesus, Lance. He’s really made a mess of things this time, hasn’t he?” No no no. This wasn’t me, was it? 

Teacher’s can’t hit kids, but a teacher did hit me (a kid). What else are teachers actually allowed to do? Are they allowed to kill me? Throwing my biggest tantrum ever was a mistake. I threw a tantrum so big I could die. I have to defend myself.

There’s a pair of scissors in a mug on Mr. Peters’ desk. I climb to my feet and grab the scissors.

“Hannigan, what are you doing?” says Mr. Dwinel. “Put down the scissors and maybe we can–” Stab stab stab stab stab. “***AH***! Jesus Christ!.” There’s blood soaking through Mr. Dwinel’s shirt, and he deserves it. I push him out of the way, and as chubby as Mr. Dwinel is, he falls, and I run out of the room, and I’m running with my scissors. I need to get away. 

The school around me blurs because I’m running so fast, and I think I’m running faster than I ever have before and 

**BANG**

I realize now that my logic regarding whether skipping is prohibited in the hallways of Greenwood Middle School was unsound. The purpose of the rule is to minimize the damage caused by fast-moving objects in the hallway. Running in the hallway increases both the likelihood in which students will collide and the bodily harm induced by the collisions. Skipping is closer to running in its speed than it is to walking, and the definition of running in the rule is based off of speed, not off of gait. Therefore, skipping is indeed prohibited by the rules of Greenwood Middle School, and for good reason. Maya’s hall pass falls out of her hand as she falls onto the tile.

I’m on top of her. We’ve both fallen to the floor. I look over my shoulder. No one is chasing me yet. Luckily, my scissors did not cause any further damage during the collision.

“Um, hey man,” says Maya. I don’t know what to say. I’ve hurt her again, but I’m looking into her eyes, and she doesn’t look mad or scared. She just looks very sad.

“I messed up, Maya,” I say. “I’m–I’m sorry.”

“It’s okay, Colin. I’m okay. Can you just, um, get off me?” 

I get up.

“You’re um, you’re bleeding,” says Maya as I stand..

“Yeah,” I say. I look over my shoulder. Officer Williams is turning the corner of a faraway hallway, and he’s slowly and calmly walking towards me.

“I need to go,” I say. “I’m–I’m leaving. I’m sorry. I wish…I wish we could’ve stayed friends.”

“Yeah, man,” says Maya. Officer Williams is getting closer.

“So, uh, bye,” I say.

“Yeah. Bye,” says Maya. And there’s no good reason to stay any longer, so I’m running again.

And now I’m in the library, and now I’m in the little study room off the library. I don’t have much time. Officer Williams is coming soon. While scissors famously beats paper, I am almost certain that scissors loses to gun. I start stabbing into the wall.

Here come the flies. I’m used to it by now, so used to it that it’s almost boring. I climb into the wound. The skin is deep and thick here, and it's like I'm climbing a sideways rock-climbing wall made of flesh. Then, I’m through. I take a deep inhale of the warm, moist air. I let the buzzing overtake my thoughts as I get to my feet.

I step out of the little study room. Mrs. Skellein is dead on the carpet, and the flies are swarming out of her decayed gut and her maggot-eaten eyes like geysers. I step over her towards the door, no longer bothering to swat away the flies as I walk.

The hall is filled with the dead, and it's filled with rot, but it's so, so much better to be down here than it is to be up there, and I’m never, ever going back

Blue looked scared at this sudden change

“Oh yes you should be mute, don't worry, give me your hand” Gold said. Blue nervously gave her his hand, it looked like she was doing some reading first until she put his free arm on his palm and healed his voice.

“Woah it actually worked?”

“Yep”  


“Wait, how did I go mute?”

“Well,” she stopped herself until she continued “It’s between my girlfriend and myself”

“You have a girlfriend?”

“Oh, about that,”

“How did you two even meet?”

“Well it’s kind of hard to explain”

“Yeah you're still getting used to it aren't you?”

“How did you know?”

“Me and Yellow were like that for a while now”

“Well, I like her, a lot”

“Does she have powers like you?”

“Well, kind of”

“What do you mean ‘kind of’?”

“They are kind of the opposite of mine”

“Oh I see”

Meanwhile

Pink was at a coffee shop and noticed a sort of Glitch walk in. She got up and watched it carefully.

“%\^*##&#\^#*@\^#\*#\^#&$)#\*#\^#%” The Glitch said

“Uh what?” The cashier asked not knowing what The Glitch said

Pink realizes who it is and carefully comes closer. She was about to get it when her phone buzzed LOUDLY and The Glitch ran off

“Great,” Pink checks her phone

“Hey Pink mind if me and my friends come to That Coffee Shop with you?” Gold texted

“Sure”

Meanwhile

“Okay everyone she said yeah!” Gold said to The Color Gang and Purple

“YES, i needed coffee forever” Red said

When they got there Pink wanted to talk to Gold immediately

“Gold, can we talk alone?”

“Why?”

“It’s” Her voice turns into a whisper “It’s the glitch again,” Gold stayed silent thinking of the trauma she went through as a kid.

“Who is ‘The Glitch’?” TSC asked

“It’s someone who Gold’s powers come from at least most,”

“What did we even miss?” Purple asked

“You have to ask King.”

“Does he know what’s going on?” Yellow asked

“Well he only knows what happened on ‘that’ day”

“Can we stop talking about this?” Gold asked

“Yes, maybe let's find White?”

“Yeah lets do that”

When they got to His house he was home and answered the door  
“Why are you two- why did you bring six people I said never make me meet new people”

“I know but these ones you need to meet”

The Glitch got up behind them but before it can get to them a very dark red shows up and stabs it with a dagger knife. The Glitch vanishes.

“Close one am I right?” The person said

“Uh who are you?” Blue asked

“Oh i’m Azure” Azure had a very bloody red dress on with a mix of black.

“Uh huh and how did you find us” Yellow asked suspiciously

“Oh i was just walking along and saw that thing coming so i decided to help”

“I’m TSC and this is Blue, Yellow, Red, Green, Purple, Gold, Pink, and White!” TSC was willing to show her Alan’s PC but Red was unsure  
“Second we don’t even know her”

“That is true Second we barely just met her” Yellow said

“I guess that’s true”

“Oh that’s fine” 

When they left they decided to go to a dance with Azure, Pink, White, Gold, and The Color Gang. When they got there, there was no sight of Azure and White. Then they heard a gunshot and a guy collapsed onto the ground bleeding.

“OH MY GOD!” Blue screamed. TSC rushed over and quickly healed him with his powers.

“OH MY LORD WHAT HAPPENED?!” Azure said coming to help.

“Don't worry he should be okay i have powers to help him and see he just has a scar now”

“Interesting,” White said.

“Who did this to him?” Azure asked

“We don’t know.” Yellow said

“We should know who it is,” Azure said, looking around.

“Oh come on Azure, we should NOT know by now,” White said

“Not to be rude or anything but-” Green said but was interrupted by another gun shot, this time hitting TSC.

“SECOND!” Purple said worried

“I’m fine just find out who it is!”

They started looking around as soon as TSC healed himself and all the people in the dance ran away. Pink was looking outside with Gold, White was with Azure, Purple was looking on the second floor. and all the color gang were discussing what happened.

“Well who are the suspects?” TSC asked The Color Gang

“Well my suspicions were on Azure and White but the second gun shot went off when they were with us” Red stated

“I think i know who” Yellow said

“Who?” Blue asked worried

“I think it was victim”

“Do you guys know how to use a gun?” Red asked Gold, Pink, Azure, and White

“Well I know how to but i rarely even use one i don't even own one.” White said

“I can't even hold a gun” Gold said

“Same here” Azure said “I know how to use dagger’s but gun’s? No”

“Guess we should just sleep on it” Red said

After…

“I said to kill them not leave them to go sleep” A person said

“Yes sir, its part of the plan” A second person said

“Then do it correct I want them dead”

“Yes sir”

As soon as I opened the door I was hit with the most god awful sour fishy smell. He hadn’t cleaned at all. A coffee cup he sat down the last day I was there was in the exact same spot with mold growing in it. There was dirty dishes and clothes all over the apartment. His kitchen was foul. His trash was over flowing. I went into the game room and it reeked like trash and bo. He was on his game and I could smell his breath from about three feet away. 

I walked into the bed room and it was just as bad. I cried. I was so frustrated and disgusted I cried. I’m a shower twice a day, no shoes on the carpet, no outside clothes in the bed room kind of person- I give in for the stretches of days on and because I know he has mental health issues. 

My question is would there be any way he changes or are we even compatible at this point? I’m so disgusted by him I literally almost canceled this vacation. ",6,1765475989.0,relationship_advice,16,0.88,False

I'm a 34 year old woman planning a solo vacation to San Diego sometime this spring, probably in April. This will be my fifth time visiting San Diego, but it will be my first time doing it solo. This vacation means a lot to me, as it will be my very first solo vacation, and I want to make sure I do it right. The biggest thing is to do everything I can't do at home in Indiana.

I've stayed in Coronado and Mission Hills for all of my previous trips and wanted to go somewhere else this time. I was thinking somewhere between La Jolla and Encinitas and wanted to know what you all thought. I'd like to be walking distance, if possible, from some decent coffee shops and restaurants that have amazing views (and maybe amazing people watching). They don't need to be 5 star places. Here's what I'm interested in doing so far:

* Paragliding and walking/hiking in Torrey Pines
* Trolley tour
* Boat tour
* Kayaking / sea caves
* Birch Aquarium
* Maybe Balboa Park. I know this place is a staple, but would it be fun for a solo traveler who isn't big into museums?

I have zero interest in shopping, bar hopping, or sitting around for too long, so hopefully that helps narrow it down further. Is there something else I should add to the list that would satisfy my urge for adventure? I'm willing to spend a day doing something farther east if that's the case.

I am wondering if anyone has any advice about what flavours might suit her - I understand that this isn't necessarily what most look for in coffee.

I have gone through the Nespresso site and looked at the notes they have listed.

Consciously seeking kindred spirits. Perhaps even my forever and always. But hey, even that kind of solid connection is best founded on the grounds of *pakka* friendship, don't you think? Forever is a long time, might as-well spend it with your best friend for life.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with gingerbread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A Christmas movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

As per the infield, I think Okamoto is the dream, but I’d doubt he’d want to come to America to be a platoon hitter, either. Rosario re-signing would make sense but I know he’s a butcher out there.

My fever dream? See if the Orioles are willing to part with Coby Mayo now that their infield is clogged up with Pete.

Guys…
Im a relatively new Central Park runner. Im usually a street guy, so I’ve never encountered this issue before because there’s coffee shops everywhere. 

Typically around mile 3/4 of my runs I need to stop for a quick bathroom break. Nothing crazy, just a little pit stop to clear out what’s bouncing around inside. Here is my issue: where the heck does one do this in CP? I know theres the bathroom by Tavern on the Green and then the one before Cat Hill… but what about in between there?

I started feeling gurgling in the tummy as I passed the reservoir. What then ensued was maybe the most horrifically painful thing I’ve ever experienced. Cold sweat. Panic ensuing. Cursing every person that passed by for looking so comfortable in their bowel movements during my plight.The last three miles of my run were pure stomach pain, ass clenched, praying to the holy mother Mary that I make it home without liquid gold pouring down my leg. I imagined how I would have to call my girlfriend to come and meet me in the park with a fresh set of clothing… how I would have to look my adult partner in the eye knowing she knows my secret. I have to leave him, she would think, because only a man that can’t provide would shit his pants in Central Park….

Eventually, we made it home without sacrificing my dignity or my deposit I put down on the engagement ring, but it got me thinking… does anyone know any other bathroom up around Harlem hill? Has anyone had this happen to them and like… gone on to shit in the woods? Is that illegal or just frowned upon? Like I know technically you’re not supposed to but would you actually get in trouble if you were caught? IS THIS A COMMON PROBLEM?

1pk3nfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LibraryofBabel/comments/1pk3nfh/finally_decided_to_type_out_the_beginnings_of/,Finally decided to type out the beginnings of what my dad put my family through for the last few years....,"Why I believe in demons.  
  
I’m not a religious person. I don't believe in supernatural occurrences. A former foundational part of my world view was that there is no such thing as evil people. Just misunderstood people who were put in bad situations. Reasonable people who hurt people because of some underlying explainable reason. Even Hitler was a ""good"" guy, I thought. I’m sure he thought he was doing good in his mind, anyway, ya know? All evil is done in the name of good. I could never quite explain serial killers to myself nor people who just brazenly hurt other people for no discernable reason, though. In the light of their existence, my world view faltered so I tried not to think about that too much. Believing every person is a good person if given the opportunity to do so was he bedrock of my liberal world view. Welp, that all changed one night after a hypothetical question which my father posed to me.  
  
We were downstairs talking, shooting the shit about random stuff. Apparently he wasn’t listening to me, though (he tends to do that), because I was talking for a little bit of a stretch, I don't remember about what, and then he interrupted me to pose the following off subject hypothetical question: He asked me if I thought it would be either 'fun' or 'funny' (not sure which word he used nor which word usage would have been...probably 'fun') if you were on a airplane and you took a shit that was so nasty that the other people on the plane started vomiting getting sick from how big of a shit you took. He pointed out that the thrill of it to him was that the other people would have nowhere to go to escape his shit smells because they're on a plane. I was immeasurably thoroughly disgusted ad I know it had to have shown on my face, but I tried to spin it into something I could wrap my mind around, so I said, ""yeah I guess it would be kind of cool if you took a shit that was so big and then they had to land the airplane and you could brag that you took a shit so big they had to reroute air traffic on account of it. That’s not what my dad thought was fun or funny though. He made sure to point out that the reason he thought it was fun or funny because the people on the plane would have nowhere to go and they be forced to smell his shit until they got sick. He was kinda high on weed gummies, and he’s not used to getting high and never tried to do so until after it was legal. Many times I've heard him offer up egomaniacal horseshit while he’s high, the type of thoughts you might have had when you were in grade school if you're a normal person. After he said it and I started to answer his query, I could see that he was scanning me up and down with his eyes, knowing that he probably said something that he shouldn’t have said...I dismissed myself and then obsessed about his comment for the next day and a half. I came to the conclusion that only a demon could ever produce such a thought (even though I don't believe in demons). He made sure to point out that the thrill to him about it was that people were on an airplane and they would have nowhere else to go and they’d be forced to smell his shit. Were there children on the airplane in his little fantasy???  
  
Him saying that to me literally changed my entire world view. This happened months before the ""coffee incident"" which pushed me over the edge. I found I had hard time even being in the same room with him after he asked me that. Sadistic people who sit around thinking about harming other people for fun do in fact exist. And they get off to it. Evil is real. Demons are real. I personally can’t even stand to think  about any animal suffering at all. But I guess some people sit around fantasizing about such things. We were talking about something completely different, but he wasn’t even paying attention to me. He was sitting there fantasizing about shitting down strangers' throats until they vomit. Is that not some sick ass coprophilic Nazi bullshit?  
  
If someone can explain to me how a non-demon could ever produce such a thought, I’d love to hear that. My dad was my role model my life my whole life. I used to think he was the smartest/greatest person I knew. And a good person. Make reality make sense to me in a way where I’m still able to love my father like I used to, please… If it was just this, I probably could write it off. But, there's a preponderance of other things which I will get to eventually which ultimately shaped my view on my father.
I said I would no longer publicly say anything about my dad, but, I wake up every day pacing around about how angry I am about the other stuff which he put me and my mother through the last couple years of her life. I am sick of doing that. I have to get this shit off my chest. This is an attempt to put this behind me and move on with my life. I was in prison for a year+ but the three worst years of my life were during the pandemic when I was forced to eat his shit sandwiches every day after the police ran me out of town and I had nowhere else to go so I had to move back in with mommy and daddy. So, I’m going to be writing probably every day about what kind of a person I think he is because I have about 100 other stories that are probably not as bad as this (to me) concerning how abusive/racist/misogynist of a scumbag he is. I'll run out of days before I run out of disgusting truths I'm able to relay about him. I’m still too angry a year later to talk about it sensibly without being enraged, but I’m going to try my best.  
  
Also, I’m allowed to talk about my dad on Facebook. He’s blocked. I don’t care if he reads this. When he got an OP against me in court, he entered into evidence my Facebook post asking for help for my family, even though he was blocked. Apparently, it’s harassment to even talk about him to other people in my family. This is not harassment. I don’t care if he ever reads it at all. I’m morally obligated to let everyone know what it is his only son thinks about him and to explain myself to others. Feel sorry for him all you want, I kind of do myself just because he refuses to not be a gaslighting piece. He'll swear to God that he would never do the thing that you just saw him do which is the reason you're pissed off at him and he'll try to turn back it around on you if you refuse to disbelieve your own eyes. I have multiple examples of him doing exactly that which I will be fleshing out in excruciating detail. This is what a win looks like to him.

I’m sure this gets asked all the time but we want to stay very close to slopes. What does that even mean? It looks like 3 mountains intersect there at the base and it’s a car free village. Is it all Matterhorn? Can someone comment on which are groomed maintained slopes? No backcountry or off piste adventure stuff for us. Ideally less than $500 per night at hotel and probably can’t afford ski in/ski out hotels but being next to a gondola or shuttle would be ideal. The only carless village I’ve been to is Vail and that is a f***load of waking. I don’t even know where to start researching. I don’t want to take a train in or walk for miles carrying my equipment or eve worse, wearing ski boots. I can barely get up, have coffee and slow mo walk to the base - I’m not an elite athlete. My companion is but I will slow us down.

Edit add: also what layers do we need? For example Colorado is a lot warmer overall than say Vermont where your bone marrow freezes from humidity. Visibility? Any general comments would be great and help. ",1,1765474385.0,Zermatt,6,1.0,False

Not pushing for labels, but saying things like “I can’t wait for our first holiday together” or “my friends already love you,” and I barely know what her coffee order is yet.

What’s throwing me off is she’s not being clingy just excited. But for me, excitement takes longer. I warm up slowly. It’s not that I don’t like her I do I just don’t fall headfirst instantly, and now I feel like I’m lagging behind her energy.

The other night I was budgeting for the week, and I remembered I have some money saved up in case we plan something nice together soon and instead of feeling excited, I felt pressure. Like if I plan something too good, I’ll accidentally confirm expectations I’m not ready for yet.

Looking for advice on a coffee setup. Budget: ₹50,000–60,000 total for machine + grinder (I can stretch a little but prefer cheaper).

I want occasional weekend espresso and daily cappuccinos, so easy milk steaming is important.

Two machines I checked:

Lelit Anna with PID — getting quoted at \~₹60,000 (machine only).

Anita — quoted at \~₹70,000, comes with a grinder.

They’re both slightly above my target, so I’m keen on recommendations below that (machine + grinder together). I’d be happy to use a standalone machine without a grinder and buy the grinder separately.

Prefer something easy to use and reliable as well as for long term use-10 years.

Sunny when it’s over.

He thinks about that a lot.  

The next morning, the train is busy, standing room only.

A woman looks at him; they make eye contact. She pities him, or is that fear? His own panic is mild, yet he grips the pole tighter. It will be his eyes; they give it all away. He shuts them as long as he can.

His ticket doesn’t go through the barrier, it will be the police, this is it. But no one comes, he holds up commuters who say nothing, because they’re polite enough not to, but tut because they’re human.

The croissant he gets is stale, the coffee bland. A karmic justice. He uses the wrong card to pay and spends the next twenty minutes worrying about his overdraft fee. He can’t help it.

At work no one speaks to him. That’s fine. His emails don’t even load, as if in agreement. After ten minutes he takes the first of many toilet breaks, holding the broken cubicle door shut with one arm as he scrolls aimlessly.

Lunchtime inches toward him and yet the break speeds past. Still nothing. His foot jammers, he finds it hard to concentrate. The cells of the spread sheet seem to wink at him. They know.

By midafternoon he can’t take it anymore. He feigns sickness, he leaves in a hurry. Rather than the train, he walks. There’s no purpose to it, no destination, the pavement feels claggy beneath his feet. It’s pulling him down, he might want it to, he thinks.

Someone stops him in the street. It snaps him back. He was here yesterday, a man says. He shakes his head, mutters something. The building looms over him, another person comes toward him.

A third and a fourth soon follow. They poke and they prod. You were here; it’s a chant. It’s you. Why did you do that? Why did you come back?

It’s not sunny now. The sky spins, faster until he falls.

He wakes in his bed.

Ready to do it all over again.

Both of us said we felt right together and how we knew just clicked. 4 weeks in my insecurities/traumas came out of me triggered her traumas thought she was gonna break up with me asked a few questions when she came back from a weekend away. I owned up to it that night and I apologized for it. A few days later she broke up with me it triggered her. A week later we got back together, as I still messaged a few times. 3 weeks later we broke up again she felt there was an overwhelming pressure because of a few things I have a habit of repeating myself and I was trying to plan on seeing her. She said the pressure chipped away at her feelings but she didn’t tell me how she was those 3 weeks and even said sorry about it. I did tell her how I feel and how I’m always gonna be feel because we broke up because of communication issues nothing to do with connection or compatibility. 

We agreed to be friends and still send the odd the message which is me who initiates but she gives me warm replies. We still send Tik toks to each other. We also work together now and again aswell so we do have a good chats and playful banter at work. It’s been 4 weeks since we broke up and like I said Iv seen her multiple times at work and I can feel the connection there. However I kind of got it out with her but the last 2 weeks she has been talking to an old school friend, been for a coffee and and hike and then going for another hike. I asked her about boundaries and she said there wasn’t anything to tell she is only seeing how things go. Problem I have is we still have a laugh etc but she has never said don’t message or even been cold with me. 

I have been reading about attachment styles and I’m an anxious attachment and she’s an avoidant. Everyone has told me to move on and focus on that and even stop the messaging contact with her. I get that but I do enjoy talking to her as it did start off as a friendship and we spoke everyday for nearly 7 months before we broke up the first time. I am trying to just focus on myself and keep reminding myself that things are out of my control so focus on that but I genuinely like her and miss her and she knows how I feel because I have told her so many times how much I adore her and have treat her right. Both of us have came from bad relationships aswell.

So my question is this are there any success stories or is it all just move on and never go back? I want to move on and I want to give it time and have faith because I’m so sure of us.

 (here's why)

I see a lot of posts here from freelancers and small business owners who feel stuck because they don't really know their customers. They're guessing at pain points, creating content that falls flat, and wondering why their messaging isn't landing.

The common belief? ""Customer profiling is too complicated for someone like me.""

Here's what I've learned (and it changed everything):
Customer profiling isn't complicated—it's just been gatekept by expensive agencies and corporate marketing departments who make it sound complicated.

You don't need:

Survey tools with 1,000 responses

A marketing team analyzing spreadsheets

Weeks of research and data analysis

You need 3 things:

The right questions about your business
A clear framework (what insights actually matter)
A way to analyze it quickly

With proper prompting and the right AI setup, you can generate a full customer profile—pain points, questions they're asking, objections, content ideas—in the time it takes to grab coffee.

The hard part was never the doing. It was knowing what to ask and how to structure it.

My question for this community: If you could know the top 10 questions your ideal customer asks before buying, would that change how you create content? What's currently stopping you from figuring that out?",1,1765473801.0,MarketingHelp,1,1.0,False

Here is my ""draindrop"" fueled by too much coffee this weekend.

1. The market does not care how hard something used to be, it only cares how hard it is today. 
2. If AI made your work faster and you kept the same offer, the buyer noticed, even if they never said it out loud. 
3. Pricing pressure is usually the first sign that the market found a cheaper way to get the same outcome. 
4. Your buyer does not want software, they want a result, AI made that even more true. 
5. The more you sell hours, the easier you are to replace. 
6. The more you sell outcomes, the harder you are to compare. 
7. If a non technical founder can vibe code an MVP in a weekend, your advantage is not the code any more. 
7. Your advantage is how deeply you understand the problem and the people who have it.
8. Founders who talk to customers every day will beat founders who only talk to their roadmap.
9. Cheap capital hid a lot of bad products, higher rates exposed them. 
10. AI is not killing all jobs, it is killing lazy thinking about which jobs you choose. 
11. The closer your work is to a template, the more likely AI will eat it. 
12. The closer your work is to a relationship, the more likely you can raise prices. 
13. The first version of your product should be ugly and fast, not pretty and late. 
14. Your buyers do not read your deck as carefully as you do, but they do read your pricing page. 
15. If buyers keep asking for discounts, you are either not different enough or not clear enough. 
16. Most founders overestimate how unique their product is and underestimate how unique their story can be. 
17. The easiest way to raise prices is to raise your standard of who you work with. 
18. Niche is not a buzzword, it is a filter that keeps you out of bad deals. 
19. When someone says your quote is expensive, what they usually mean is I do not trust this will work. 
20. Testimonials are proof you worked, case studies are proof you delivered outcomes. 
21. Screenshots do not close deals, stories do.
22. If you cannot explain your product to a non technical friend in one paragraph, you will struggle telling your story on the internet. 
23. Early users care more about whether you listen than whether your product is perfect. 
24. The right ten customers are more valuable than the wrong one hundred. 
25. Do not chase enterprise logos if you have not nailed value for small serious teams frist. 
26. A long sales cycle is sometimes code for nobody feels urgency. 
27. You cannot fix a weak offer with better copy. 
28. You can fix a decent offer with better distribution. 
29. Every founder should know exactly where their buyers complain online and read those threads weekly. 
30. If you never feel uncomfortable raising your prices, you are probably underpriced. 
31. There is always someone charging ten times what you charge for a similar outcome, they just picked a different customer segment. 
32. The more complicated your pricing is, the less likely people are to say yes. 
33. Free tiers are not a strategy, they are a bet that you can convert attention into money later.
34. Some ideas make better agencies than products, that is fine if you are honest with yourself about it. 
35. AI tools will not save a bad business model, they only help you fail faster. 
36. Founders who learn to ship with AI personally have a better instinct for what is now easy or hard. 
37. You do not need to become a world class engineer, but you should be dangerous with your own tools. 
38. The most valuable thing you build is trust, not features. 
39. Trust compounds when you show up, share your thinking, and admit when you are wrong. 
40. Ghosting your early adopters is one of the fastest ways to kill a product. 
41. Momentum is a feeling your team gets when they see things ship and customers respond. Protect that feeling. 
42. Do not let one loud critic scare you away from a path that real customers love. 
43. But also, do not ignore patterns in negative feedback because it hurts your ego. 
44. Most founders pivot too late, not too early. 
45. You should have at least one channel where you get honest feedback that is not your friends or colleagues.
47. In a world of AI generated noise, being specific about who you help and how you help them is a superpower. 
48. Automation without a clear offer is just a faster way to spin your wheels. 
49. The market is not out to get you, but it is not waiting for you either. Act accordingly.",2,1765473789.0,ExperiencedFounders,1,1.0,False

If I am honest I've always been a bit, not avoidant, but not interested in relationships majorly. I've had relationships, but when I was younger. My longest relationship was four years from 16 to 20.

I then just fell into study and setting myself up for life. I've spent the last 10 years just sorting out career, upskilling and getting my own place. And at some point, being solo became nice and I haven't thought about a relationship, or a need to in ages. I've had dates here and there, typically encouraged by friends who'd talk me into Tinder. But Tinder doesn't work for me, not that I don't get likes, I simply hate the interaction of it. I get matches and tend to forget to ever message. My phone is hardly ever in my hand, I'm critically offline really.

However I have recently moved. I'm in an area now where I know no-one and as a social and outgoing person I was missing Friday night drinks, clubs and stuff. So in the summer I started attending various groups and clubs. I've also attempted to be more online, I made an Instagram in June, and linked my Spotify (only two social medias I have) Other than an anonymous reddit for silly questions - like this one. Account Number... I've lost count. 

(anyone who says making friends later in life is easy... have never tried it haha. It's difficult as everyone re in fixed group dynamics now. And clubs, people often use to turn of after work, not network and make friends - they have friends they talk about whilst there and e them. But it has worked! I speak to a couple of people thankfully, just highlighting it's difficult.

Anyway, something strange has happened. I seem to have fallen for someone I've met. Wasn't planning on it, but they have the same humour, interests, and aesthetics. And annoyingly, when I'm out and they're their I find I want to be on the same table as them to try and learn more about them.

Annoyingly they seem to be a spitting image of a crush I used to have in a favourite book series of mine - reading from a young age influences more than I realised, till I was older and found I had a *type* now.

But yeah. I have no idea how to broach this. 

1. I don't want to make an evening awkward by *hitting* on and then either one of us not being reciprocal or it doesn't work out, how does that change the dynamics of the evening.

2. I don't want to approach and it be taken badly by them because they're out they don't want people hitting on them, I should've known. Or just somehow making it out that I should've been psychic. 

3. I don't know what their preferences are, or if they're single / taken.

4. My last experience on face-to-face asking out was just awful: I was out shopping and happened to bump into someone - literally - in the busy shops. we laughed and parted ways. met in another shop and laughed, and I asked if they wanted to grab a coffee with me they said yeah. We left the shop and went next door and ended up chatting and drinking for a long while and at the end I asked for their number - and they lost it. They're just shopping, not looking to be hit on and eyed up. Can she not just have a drink with a friend etc... etc... all whilst patrons of the cafe were watching and I'm like errrhhhh.... so I just never approached anyone again after that. I'm out shopping, so are you. That's all it is. I'm out drinking, so are you, I'll leave it be. Someone will approach me if they liked wouldn't they? but then, that's not allowed? we have to do the approach and weigh-up the cost / benefits (cost of being shamed for it, or benefit it works.) and if none of that, it has to be Tinder.

Anyway. Life seems to be in a good place for me, nice house, fantastic job, education and whatnot. building good friends around me. And now, this person has appeared in my life, and I've become smitten.

My plan was to just continue going to this thing every week, and just continue as normal. If they're interested they'll ask me. But then I was concerned, what if they did end up liking me but had the exact same thoughts, and so didn't say anything themselves.",1,1765473770.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

We went to Disneyland.  They had holiday drinks, some had alcohol and some did not.  Now I drink less than 1 a week and will often go months without having a drink.  I tried one alcoholic drink one day, and the next day was going to try another.  MIL asked if I was an alcoholic.  I laughed and said, ""Yes, and my husband supports my drinking habit"" b/c he was actively looking for a gift card to pay for the drink, since they weren't discounted (We got some discounts on stuff w/our VISA).  Got her to shush though and she didn't make any more comments about my alcohol consumption.  The brownie white Russian was very good btw, as was their blue holiday drink.  I didn't care for the holiday mule I had at another restaurant though.

She got pissy when my son, 18, asked her (politely I might add) to not touch him.  She does this weird thing where she'll aggressively grab someone by the arm, or stomach area or something in order to ""play"" or ""bond"" or whatever, which makes my son really uncomfortable b/c she gets up in your face when she does it too.  It's kind of hard to explain exactly what she does, but I've never seen a normal person do this...  I told him, ""Good.  I'm glad you stood up for yourself.  She should keep her hands to herself.""

There were a few moments where my son had an attitude and I had to have chats w/him, but overall, he was okay.

She pouted b/c she kept wanting to go on Small World at night b/c it's her favorite ride.  When we tried to book the fast passes, the ride was closed (as verified by DH and myself), and I could tell she didn't believe my son.  She storms away, throws her hands up in the air and says, ""Whatever.  Don't worry about it.""  I told him to take a screen shot and send it to her, which he didn't.  We ended up being able to do it the next day though.  I had a chat w/my son while he sat there w/a frown on his face the whole time (b/c he hates the ride).  I reminded him that he wasn't required to go on the ride.

I had to ask my MIL to stop talking about the money we were spending on all of the specialty dinners and remind her that DH and I had budgeted for the trip.  We made a commitment that we were doing ""all of the things"" since it was the girls' first trip, and we won't be doing ""all of the things"" again.  She was stressing me out with her constant remarks over the cost of the food.  (I HIGHLY recommend splurging on the Princess Breakfast at least once, Goofy's Kitchen, Blue Bayou, and World of Color Dessert party btw).  I didn't argue when she said she was going to pay for the hotel.  She kept saying it, but I just said, ""Okay.""  We spent probably $10K on the rest of the trip, so if she REALLY wants to pay for the hotel that badly, fine by me.  We were going to pay for it, but I was too busy packing up to argue w/her over it.

She made remarks about how the maids would strip the beds, and how I didn't need to worry about it, and laughed when I asked her to strip the beds.  I always strip the beds b/c it helps the maids out, and I can make sure nothing gets left behind.  After she left, I ended up finding a bag of hers, and her hairbrush wrapped in her bedding that I stripped, and a toy stuck under a nightstand when I did a final walk around, along w/a part of the kid's potty seat... even though I asked her to do a final walk-through.  She turned red when I had DH hand it to her.

On the way home, DH and I both wanted to kick her out on the side of the road.  My 3-year-old needed to do a #2, and didn't go at the hotel when prompted.  It usually takes her a couple of tries before she's ""ready"", so sometimes we'll have to make a few stops.  Just before we left, we had her take the youngest two to the bathroom while DH and I finished packing the car.  3 was upset b/c she wanted to go swim in the pool (where the bathrooms were) and was having a meltdown, b/c she's 3, and doesn't seem to fully understand that it's too cold, we don't have the swimsuits, and it's time to leave.

We get a few miles down the road and she starts saying ""OW!!! and saying she needed to go potty.""  I said to pull over.  My MIL of course makes a remark about how she's ""just doing it for attention and to get out of the car.""  I was livid but held my tongue.  After several comments of the like, she says, ""Well maybe we can pull over to the side of the road, and I'll just take her.""  I called out, ""So do it. You do whatever the H\*ll you want.""  She makes another remark and then says, ""But I'm not gonna say anything...""  I piped up, ""And yet, you KEEP saying things!!!""  We pulled over to a Starbucks, and I get out of the car and tell DH to handle it.  He takes 3 to the bathroom while I order myself a coffee and a pink drink for my 6-year-old who was being VERY good in the car.

DH asks me for help, and I go into the bathroom to help him calm down my screaming 3-y-o while the drinks are being made.  I'm sitting on the floor of the bathroom, calming my child down, while DH runs out to grab wipes and new pull-ups (She has occasional accidents, but is doing well using the potty, so no judgement please).  Then people start banging on the door, and I keep yelling, ""OCCUPIED!""  Then the barista is banging on the door telling me my drinks are ready.  I get out of the bathroom with my tear-streaked child, who is finally calmed down, and my husband and I say, ""I'm sorry.  I was busy dealing with my daughter, who was having an existential crisis.""  I got, ""Oh it's okay.""  I don't know what they thought we were doing in there, but apparently it was a problem.

We get back in the car, and DH is trying to explain to his mother what the problem was, and that we know our daughter and when she has to go.  After she tried justifying her comments I said, ""Except you made the comment that she was just looking for attention, and your comments aren't helpful.""  I should add that when I said that the comments weren't helpful, I made an effort to change my tone to be less abrasive b/c I was pissed and trying to have an adult conversation.  She huffs, crosses her arms, and says, ""Well FINE.  I'LL JUST KEEP MY DAMN MOUTH SHUT AND WON'T SAY ANYTHING.""  This set me off.  I snapped back, ""And see?  You get upset when you tell us to let you when you say something inappropriate.""  She yells back, ""It's not WHAT you say.  It's HOW you say it!!!""  DH stood up for me and said, ""She didn't say it in a way that was offensive.""  She snaps, ""Well I don't know WHY you think that I said she was just looking for attention!  I feel like I'M the only one GETTING IN TROUBLE!""  He responds, ""No.  No, you're not.  We've all had moments where we're having to have conversations about our attitudes and behaviors.""  I reinforced, ""Actually, I thought the trip went well overall.""  Things seemed to calm down after that.  When we got home, I told my husband that it was like that scene in the original Parent Trap movie where Verbena says, ""I'm not saying a word... not ONE word..."" and continues to gossip and make remarks about Vikki.

At another potty break that evening, I asked to sit up front so that I could have a little more room to stretch my legs.  MIL gets in the back and yells, ""OH MY GOD!  IT STINKS BACK HERE!!!""  I told my son to put on his shoes (I had him get foot powder while we were in the hotel, b/c his feet smelled awful).  She went on and on and on about how it smelled like, ""Disinfectant and something else.""  I handed her the hand sanitizer that was used.  ""No.  It's not that.""  We made another stop, and DH asked me to switch seats back with her b/c he was tired of hearing her bellyache.  I complied and dealt w/it, as I had been doing the entire first half of the trip.

So yeah, DH and I are ready for our own vacation b/c, as he put it, ""We had 4 kids too many on this trip.""

Other than the ride home, the trip wasn't all that bad... but DH set a TON of boundaries beforehand.  I feel like the youngest two were the best behaved.",5,1765473458.0,motherinlawsfromhell,1,1.0,False

I wanted to share a micro-study with you about using AI Roleplay chat to help language learners overcome one of the biggest barriers: speaking anxiety.  
  
The study looked at people who practiced speaking through AI-powered Roleplay scenarios - basically, talking to an AI partner in real-life situations like ordering coffee, checking into a hotel, job interviews, making complaints, or asking for directions. The AI responds naturally, gives instant feedback on fluency and pronunciation, and creates a safe space where learners can make mistakes without judgment.  
  
**The results from the user survey were pretty compelling:**  
• 84% of participants said they feel more confident when speaking after practicing with the AI.  
• 81% reported that they no longer feel afraid of making mistakes.  
• 75% noticed a clear improvement in their pronunciation.  
  
So far, the tool has processed over 400,000 voice messages across about 50 real-life scenarios in English, with expansion into Spanish, French, and German.  
  
The core idea is simple: many people understand a language but hesitate to speak because of anxiety or fear of being judged. An ai conversation practice tool like this gives them a chance to ""rehearse"" conversations as many times as they need before facing real-world interactions.  
  
**Question for the community:**  
  
Have any of you tried using AI roleplay or similar tools (ai speaking practice, chatbots, voice assistants) to practice speaking? Did it help reduce your anxiety, or do you still prefer practicing with real people?  
  
I’m curious to hear what’s worked for you and whether you think this kind of AI-supported practice is a good supplement to traditional learning methods.",1,1765473315.0,LearnANewLanguage,0,1.0,False

Use the same beans forever and dialed it in to those and they've always worked. Recently it does not brew within the ""espresso range"" it goes past it to about 2 o'clock and is super slow to drip and getting worse.

I used the descaler tablet cleaner this week and it made no difference. What little coffee it produces tastes like ass.

I took out the inner burr and turned it from 6 to 4. I've spent all day trying different configs for the outer burrs and here's where I am at. When I go coarse I will get liquid getting through the group head. When I go fine I get very little or nothing. When the group head is removed I will get a reasonable flow. So I am guessing it's a pressure issue if it can't push water through a fine grind.

I assume from Googling I'll need to get inside it, and I may need to clean or replace the solenoid valve. Any other suggestions of things to try troubleshoot? So many variables means it feels much harder to approach finding the problem. Thanks in advance.",1,1765473303.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Why not just get a dedicated immersion brewer like the clever dripper or hario switch? It achieves the same results with a lot less risk than the inverted method. It’s also cheaper than buying an aeropress + prismo/flow control cap.

1pk2vft,https://www.reddit.com/r/eyespots/comments/1pk2vft/my_amnpamm_diagnosis_journey/,My AMN/PAMM Diagnosis Journey,"Hi all, this group has helped me in the past when dealing with unknowns of these conditions, so I thought it was time to share my story. 

This is my personal diagnosis and what my doctor recommended - this post is not medical advice. I encourage anyone with a retina/eyespot disorder to pursue a diagnosis, or second/third/fourth opinion as far as you are willing/able. I recognize I am extremely privileged to have been able to pursue multiple doctors’ opinions.

I had my first eye spot in 2016 (as an early 20s female). It is about the size of my thumb nail held at arms length. I was (mis)diagnosed with acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN). I was told that it probably wouldn’t go away (it didn’t) and that it was a completely random one time thing (it wasn’t). The doctor theorized that a small blood clot had formed in the capillaries of my eye, probably due to my hormonal birth control. I saw a retina specialist every few months but they told me that there was nothing more for them to do except document progression. I stopped going after about a year. 

 In August 2024 I had a new eyespot form - much smaller, but still concerning. Then in September, two new, tiny spots formed. For the first time, one was in my “good” eye. This prompted me to pursue more aggressive diagnostics. There is still so much unknown about AMN and no doctor/internet site/etc. seemed to be able to answer my questions - why do these eye spots appear? How can I prevent more from happening? 

I started from the beginning again. I went to my eye doctor after the 3rd and 4th spots appeared. They couldn’t visualize any issues with my retina. They referred me to a retina specialist. Same story, he couldn’t visualize anything. He slapped his knees and said “well, I don’t know how to counsel you except refer you to another specialist.” He presented 2 options, the Mayo Clinic and another clinic. I chose the other clinic as it was closer to home. 

The specialist at “the other clinic” couldn’t visualize anything either. The same tests were performed as the other specialist and my primary eye doctor. She confirmed that I have AMN, and said it was likely caused by an autoimmune issue. She said there is nothing I can do to prevent more from forming. Then she literally told me “this condition won’t make you go blind. Feel lucky, some people are going completely blind.” Helpful to some, maybe, but it is not what I needed to hear at that moment. I was rushed out of the office. I was sad, confused, and eventually angry. I decided to pursue the Mayo Clinic. 

I finally got an appointment this summer, July 2025. I had a whole barrage of new tests that lasted all day. The specialist met with me and told me that I very clearly have paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM). What?? A whole new diagnosis? She told me that (at least in my case) this condition is absolutely not caused by an autoimmune issue (and she would know, considering autoimmune related eye issues are one of her specialities). She said that my capillaries are prone to occlusions, and there are things that can exacerbate the risk. She also could clearly see the thinning of my retina in relation to the eye spots. 

To limit my risk of reoccurrences, she recommended that I do not use hormonal birth control, that I limit my caffeine intake, that I stay hydrated, and that I avoid vasoconstrictors (especially nasal spray cold medicine). Again - these are recommendations from my doctor after seeing my test results, and not me giving anyone medical advice. 

Finally, a clear path moving forward. SOMETHING I can do to limit my risk, instead of feeling completely powerless. She listened to me, answered my questions, and treated me with compassion. 

Finally, she said that my tests show that the damaged spots of my retina are not completely “dead.” There is some blood flow/perception there. She says there is a chance the spots will fade over the years. I will go back in a year. 

I have since switched to half-caff coffee and am trying to stay hydrated. It’s only been a few months but no reoccurrences, and one of my spots is almost completely gone. The first spot has not changed in any way that I can detect. 

Anyways - best of luck to everyone struggling with these disorders. There’s so little information out there. I hope my story can encourage advocating for proper care.",2,1765472838.0,eyespots,2,1.0,False

1pk2uog,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicSpinsOnline/comments/1pk2uog/instant_withdrawal_strategy_casino_australia_real/,"instant withdrawal strategy, casino australia real money","Martingale is that strategy where you double your bet every time you lose. The idea is simple: one single win pulls you out of the hole. On paper it looks genius. You play even-money bets, start with $5, lose → go to $10, lose → $20, win → reset to $5.

I tested it last Saturday on a few instant withdrawal casino Australia real money sites, just to see if fast payouts made the pain any softer. Spoiler: they didn’t. My balance disappeared faster than I could make coffee. The first 2–3 losses feel normal. Then it jumps: $40, $80, $160… and suddenly you’re $315 down, staring at a $320 spin just to win $5 back. (Yeah, I chickened out.)

In theory, Martingale *always* works but only if you have unlimited money and no betting limits. In reality, either the game caps you or your wallet taps out. If you want something that doesn’t feel like a mini heart attack, flat betting (same bet size every spin) is way less brutal long-term.

So here’s my question: **has anyone here actually used Martingale and survived?** Did it work better in other games? Or only with strict personal limits?

We're in our 30s, and they're like family to me after being in one another's lives for decades. I love them, but I don't think I even like them anymore.

We're becoming increasingly politically opposite, which would be tolerable if it weren't for everything else.

They are incredibly self centered, any conversation about my life they pivot back to theirs. I have expressed deep, personal thoughts, which get brushed aside with at best a sentence or two, at worse an emoji.

They make derogatory comments about certain religions or cultures, despite knowing I have friends from these backgrounds. I talk about potential romantic interests and get met with derogatory comments as they've also been from minority backgrounds.

I talk about my career, they bring it back to their own with minimal acknowledgement about mine, whether that be my successes or setbacks.

I talk about my financial situation as I live alone and they (despite having 2x more disposable cash than me as they live with parents) reply about not having enough money themselves to purchase a house. Fair enough many of us are in that situation, but there is never an acknowledgement of anything I am saying.

They are inherently negative in all aspects of their life; romantic, job, housing, the country we live in. Despite being at risk of losing their job mere months ago, when the workload is quiet they refuse to do a different department's work as it's ""boring"" to them.

They bought a hidden disability lanyard to avoid wearing a mask during the lockdown years, despite not being disabled.

They refuse to drive anywhere despite passing their test (scared they'll get into a crash), but have never offered me money for fuel or even a cup of coffee when I take us out places. Stopped even saying thank you.

After an extremely traumatic event happened to me, they said they couldn't afford a train ticket to come and see me in my town (2 hours away), then that same month bought a new pair of boots for the same amount and showed them off.

When I see them in person, I find myself reverting back to an old version of me to act in a way that keeps the peace and keeps the friendship going. We reminisce about school, but I stay as neutral as possible every time they bring up anything political.

I'm tired of holding my tongue, but can't deal with arguing with someone who spouts out xenophobic beliefs as though they are facts. I don't have the energy to debate like that.

I don't know what I get out of this friendship other than my sole link to my childhood and a wealth of shared memories from school. I just know every interaction over text and in person leaves me feeling drained. And the more I'm making friends in my current town and realize how happy I feel around them, the starker the contrast is with my old friend.

Does anyone have any advice? I fear bringing this up with them will result in a potential permanent end to our friendship, which as of right now I don't think I can face. But going forward, I wonder what would actually be best for me.",2,1765472752.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I observed the morning train shooting at them occasionally as I sipped on my Irish coffee swinging back and forth on my old trusty chair. The creaking of old wood was the only sound besides the constant background music. The melody drilling into my ears. 



***EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***



 My enjoyment of the warm feeling of blood flowing down my neck was interrupted by the robotic voice of the Inspector.



*Rules are Broken* 



*Rules are Broken*



*Rules are Broken* 



His speaker mouth declared as dead eyes stared at me, reflecting only the light of his aureola. 



*How, so? Are talkin’ ‘bout the damn Gurldes again? I fucking told ya, I ain't taking care of that. That between your lavalamp ass and the Club gang.*



I answered less than eloquently, greatly annoyed at my morning solitude being disrupted. 



*Rules are Broken* 



*Rules are Broken*



*Rules are Broken*



The Inspector pointed a glass finger at my backyard. I sighed and stepped off my porch feeling my naked feet sinking into the red void. 



*I’ ll be damned!* 



I exclaimed, staring at the pair of mouths right in the center of my backyard where my statue previously sat. Enormous tongues occasionally wetting lump lips. I blinked, not believing my eye. Groan escaped my mouth. Some Adjusted Runners must lay down in my back yard. 

  


 Smoking, I waited as an eyeball bigger than my house appeared. It looked at me. Colourful iris was sliced by my knife before I crawled inside, slogging through the white jelly.



I came on the other end to a forest of tower blocks with magenta sky and tails covering the ground as far as my limbs could reach.



Jumping into the fountain at the center brought me into the good old Mushbar. It was empty as usual. I walked to the counter. Azid H poured me a shot of pink liquid then they plucked green mushroom from their left shoulder and dropped into the glass, spilling some liquor on the fuzzy surface.



*Special drink for a special king! \~* ✩♤



They chirped looking down at me with mismatched eyes. I quickly broke eye contact so as not to get high from their hypnotic gaze less, I would find myself coupling with the Inspector inside Diamond tower. Giving my brother a near eye attack. The best teacher is your past. 



*I have anomaly* 



*No…a….na…o…ly* 



I heard the squeaky voice of Dukie behind me. I did not dare to look back at his malformed visage. Terrifying combination of clubawful Runner features and Gurldes.



*Great*. 



*With the Fourth One waking up, all the fun stuff is happening!*



Azid H. giggled, flicking their scaly neon pink tail. Thought seemed to come to them as they clapped.



*Oh! Maybe COC is pranking you?! My dad said Duke was suspiciously quiet recently.* 



*I ain't trustin’ anythin’ that snake says.* 



I waved my hand dismissively. Dukie agreed, melting into the cracks of tails leaving only clothes behind. Deciding staying in the bar any longer would end up with me intoxicated out of my Spade, I left with a heavy sigh. 



Coming back to my part of the void, I found it absolutely overflowing with Runners. I groaned having my laziness to blame but instead decided the Fourth One is the culprit.



Lighting a cigarette I rolled my sleeves up and got to catching the vermin,  putting them into one twitching pile. 



The relaxing melody of the void was replaced with mouth insistent chattering. On the verge of anger a brilliant idea came to my mind.



My tentacle swiftly picked up a new Runner. It was screaming, a sound quite welcoming. I throwed it into the gaping maw. It bit the runner into two pieces. Absolutely crushing my hopes, moments later it spit out the pest. Now the two halves crawl around. Dirtying the beautiful void.



I noticed a rectangular device. The Runner must have dropped it. Something made in Diamond Kingdom? Deciding I could at least try, I spent a while figuring out how to use the technology.



All I want is my peace in solitude to return yet as I write on this device, drinking Runner whiskey I keep hearing the insistent wet sounds of the two mouths kissing passionately. 



So does anyone know how to deal with them?

1pk2tib,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pk2tib/wife_f44_keeps_complaining_and_i_m_48_cant_take/,Wife (F44) keeps complaining and I (M 48) can't take it no more.,"Been married since 2016, we have two young kids 5 and 7. From the outside we are happily married. I (M 48) make good money, we have no debt whatsoever, own our house, two cars. The kids have enough savings for college. We spent at least a month per year traveling usually overseas. 

Wife (F44) is a stay at home Mom for the most part. She has a part time job where I work that keeps her busy two mornings a week. 

She does all the laundry at home and I take the kids out Saturday most mornings for about three hours where she cleans the house. I also help with the cleaning and do all the outside work and house maintenance. She also gets Sunday mornings all to herself. I stay home with the kids and she gets to sleep in and then go out for coffee by herself. 

During week days I usually come home around 3pm and make dinner and lunch for the next day for all of us. The only exception is Tuesday where she does something easy for dinner and two Thursdays a month. She cleans afterwards and sometimes I help if there is too much to clean. Also I have gotten better to clean as I go. 

In the mornings I wake up at 6 45, empty the dishwasher and make breakfast and take our little one to preschool. She usually wakes up around 7:30 to 8 and cares for the oldest one. 

Here is the issue, she constantly complains about me and is never happy and I don't know what to do. 

Sometimes I think, we have two little angels and I should just put up with it and that no one is perfect and all things considered we have a good life. 

But other times it gets to me and we argue in front of the kids which I absolutely hate and I don't want them to grow in a such environment. 

Each complaint by itself is not bad enough, but she goes on for days and at end I end up blowing up. 

For example, while I was cooking the other day I used a pot. She gets unhappy and tells me she washed it use it herself. I didn't know that, so I said I am sorry I didn't realize that. Did you tell me that? At this point I get no response. Other times I should have let it go but I pushed for a response but got nowhere so I dropped it. Then later that evening I hear her speaking under her breath complaining about me that I used the bathroom didn't put the toilet seat down. I pushed it too much and we ended up arguing in front of the kids. Leading up to that she had gotten upset with me, because due to my doctors appointment she had to take the little one and the oldest one to school. I had told her but she had forgotten about it, so when I reminded her she got upset. Also she had gotten upset because one night I woke up early at 4am and turned on the heat. And there is more that I am forgetting.

Initially I was feeling proud of myself that I was handling the complaining well, but eventually I broke down. 

I know I need to be more careful and I have changed. At first she was to do all the homework since I was working full time. But with her complaining I have gotten to do more and more around the house which helps initially but eventually the complaining returns.

I don't know how to talk to her, at the moment she is adamant she made nothing wrong. And I can't reason with her. If I let it go and have the conversation a day or two later, she keeps avoiding it and when we do she agrees to everything and says things like I said I am sorry what else do you want to do? 

And that puts me in a weird spot, I can accept her apology but I know this is going to happen again and she is not really seeking help or doing anything to change. And I don't really have any options outside of getting a divorce, which I don't want to do mostly for the kids. But it really pisses me off, because she is like here is my apology take it or leave it and she is not making much of an effort.

Yes we have had counseling and her response was, he makes me do all the HW and is not fair that I take all the blame.

Anyways thanks for reading and any feedback or advice would be greatly appreciated.",0,1765472714.0,relationship_advice,47,0.33,False

For context my ex was a complete pile of garbage and I was blinded by love. Seriously. This man put me through the wringer and I still took the time to try to understand and forgive but he never changed. NEVER. So let me just give you strangers the info. We’re from Chicago. I’m a revert. Wasn’t when I met him. We were involved in a haram relationship. 

He actively pursued me when he knew he shouldn’t have because his family was racist and didn’t want him marrying anyone outside his background/religion. Only one good thing he did is open Islam to me. He would say one thing the Quran says and do the exact opposite. I’d point this out and he’d justify it, should have been my first red flag. This man wasted years of my life. Always begging me to stay time after time he got caught messaging any women he had just met or ones he unblocked from his past. Any little fight and he’d seek female attention. Even when he couldn’t pay rent he sent a female some coffee/lunch money. He was a complete narcissist and left me struggling often to pay for everything for a couple of years I covered everything. And he felt absolutely no remorse and it’s not like he was home actively helping out there nope just hitting up the dispensary routinely. It’ll be a pattern with this too. He’s stresssed and depressed he’ll say. He messed up. Wasn’t in the right head space. 

For my birthday I never ever received anything not even a card. I was begging this man to show an ounce of love. Anyways he was also into men too but denied it soooooo much. Made sense because of his level of homophobia he constantly displayed.

So aside from all this I was so stupid to still love him and be patient. Like oh you’re potentially bisexual that’s fine let’s talk about it. Nope he didn’t want to. Would shut it down. I always wanted to work with him on his issues. Yes I know I was really stupid here. And even worse I’m an educated woman with a high level degree and I fell and let a man like that walk all over me. He finally broke up with me and he did it in the most cowardly way ever. So now he’s going to go an marry some poor Palestinian woman that’s going to get her time wasted and her life made miserable by a man like this. I posted this on here because 1. It’s anonymous. 2. A tiktok would blow up this he could be identified. 3. Tea app just didn’t seem like the right move. 

He will label me the crazy ex oh I know that I’m sure. And that’s fine. I’m so ready for it. I have screen shots of all his behavior and actions. 

Yes I’m angry. He’s on Salams. I’m trying to warn women accordingly but can’t warn everyone I guess. And really trying to figure out what would be the best move here. He was a giant manipulator and he showed who he really was a year in. At first it was little things and then little by little I uncovered the truth. He keeps things hidden well and is a master liar. This. The way he lies needs to be studied. He believes his lies are truth. 

I understand it’s haram even putting this on here. I understand that when he meets a potential women he wants to marry there will only be so much I can do. I am not part of the community. It’s not like I’m going to be aware of who he’s potentially speaking to. It’s just messed up. This woman’s life is going to be turned upside down. And for what? A man who means nothing?

And then there’s that little bit of hope that maybe he changes his ways because that’s the optimist in me. That’s the optimist that allowed me to stay by his side for so long. That maybe just maybe he will be a better person? But then how long will that last? 

I need to warn women because I don’t want them to go through what I went through. This man is not deserving of anyone until he deals with his problems, seeks therapy and spends years alone. I made it out without children and very lucky I can close this chapter of my life but maybe the next woman that enters his life isn’t and finds things out too late. 

So what post? Include vague details about him and have people reach out with a persons name and I confirm if it’s them or not? ",3,1765472684.0,MuslimLounge,1,1.0,False

**Background:**

No Joy formed in 2009, the project of Jasamine White-Gluz and Laura Lloyd. The band went on to release three albums and a handful of EPs in the 2010s. 2020’s *Motherhood* was their fourth album, and the first with White-Gluz alone at the helm.

Whereas No Joy’s earlier work is mostly characterized as shoegaze, their sound has evolved to be much more electronic now. This lent itself well to a partnership with Angel Marcloid, also known as Fire-Toolz. White-Gluz and Marcloid co-produced No Joy’s latest record, *Bugland*, released by Hand Drawn Dracula on August 8^(th) of 2025.

The two collaborated at distance, with White-Gluz residing in Quebec and Marcloid in Illinois. A large part of their creative process involved driving the countryside, listening to songs that they suggested to one another. *Bugland* was born from the sharing of music, but also from the connection that the two of them made to the natural world as they drove down rural roads.

**Write-Up by** u/Awardenaar**:**

It’s 2020. I’m in the kitchen, doing the dishes. In the pandemic, it has become ritual. It marks the end of the days that are indistinguishable from all of the other days. It is semi-sacred. And it is always filled with music. At this moment, No Joy’s *Motherhood* is playing. It has been in constant rotation for months now.

>*“She’s the one, all tiny bones and tongue.”*

This verse always makes me think of the daughter that we may one day have. Who might this little person be, and when will we meet them?

We are, in this moment, parents-in-waiting. We’ve been in the adoption pool for some time now. Any day, the phone call might come. But it hasn’t yet. Each day passes. I clean the dishes. I wonder when the world will open back up. I wonder when we will have a child in our lives.

The dishes are nearly done. The album is on its last track.

>*“And at last you’ll be a good mom.”*

I peer into the other room, where my wife is sitting. She will. Be a good mom. I know it. I just don’t know when.

\-

It’s 2025. Our daughter is four years old. She is a lover of stories, and of adventures. Trips to the library. Forays into the backyard (often first thing in the morning). But right now, she is bored and wants to look at pictures on my phone. We try to limit this, but I’ll indulge her this time. She is inquiring about the album art in the Bandcamp app, and I can’t help but talk about my music collection.

Snail. In silhouette.

“That’s *Bugland*.”

It came out in August. I’ve been eagerly anticipating No Joy’s follow-up to *Motherhood*. It’s here, and it’s as strange as I’d been hoping. It flits about in the sky and digs deep into the dirt.

“Bugland?”

“Wanna go?”

“Yeah!”

So we do.

How does one get to Bugland? It’s not hard. Wedge yourself into the veins of tree bark, or slip down between blades of grass. Scuffle about in a dusty attic, or crawl under a mossy rock.

Over there. Those boxes that should probably have gone in the recycling, leaning awkwardly, sort of rotting. They have been stained with coffee grounds. A banana peel is draped over the top. Stale pizza crusts abound. I nearly trip as we approach the front door.

To a bug, this must be a palace. Spoiled spoils from the human world, cast aside carelessly, become a bug’s dream house. We walk into the foyer, pinching our noses from the stench, but the kiddo quickly shifts her priorities, and covers her ears. The flies are really buzzing. I love this feeling, of being awash in noise, but I respect my daughter’s choice. I wear earplugs to concerts now.

Suddenly, the buzzing cuts away, and the flies regard us with their so-many eyes. They recognize that we are outsiders, but they welcome us. The cardboard wall at the back of the house collapses to reveal an idyllic meadow, bathed in sunset. A voice, a siren call, invites us to wander.

Under careful study, the illusion falters. The orange-pink-gold glow comes not from the perfect sunset, but from a buzzing neon sign. There are no rolling hills of grass, but instead, some cilantro that is past its prime. But if one squints just so, and lets the sounds and sights get fuzzy, Bugland is a beautiful place.

The cilantro still smells great. It’s not rotten yet. The kid won’t abide the stuff on her tacos, but she plops down in it here and now. She starts twisting the leaves off and arranging them. An electronic snap interrupts the hum of the neon. I turn. Not far from the sign is a luminous blue, a high-voltage mosquito lamp. This feels, in this moment, so cruel. They are hungry. That’s all. We coat ourselves in unpleasant scents to ward them off. We kill them without a second thought. They are bloodsuckers. Why shouldn’t we?

The red stuff in our veins is sustenance. It is life. Cells. They extract methodically, never making a mess. But the thought of them landing on us, drinking from our bodies, feels…dirty? We romanticize vampires. We imagine their decadent parties with ornate punchbowls brimming with human blood. Vampires bathe in it. Mosquitos don’t.

Argh. The musings of my idle mind. Whether that was a fleeting thought or a paradigm shift, I don’t want to be in my head right now. I want to be here, in Bugland, with my daughter. With…?

Where is she?

I am on the balls of my feet, hustling this way, then that way, craning my neck. These are a series of motions familiar to all parents. This state of alarm has grabbed all of us, and will continue to do so, maybe for our whole lives. I jog, I run, I turn corners, I pick my way through a parade of ants, and there she is. She’s laughing maniacally as a pillbug furls and unfurls in response to her prodding.

“Daddy!”

“I think that rolly polly (the things we call them!) might want a little space, honey.”

As she beams at me, the pillbug strides up to her and rubs her legs. Like a cat. I guess she made a friend.

And they’re off. The pillbug rolls. The kiddo skips. I’m left standing here. This happens more and more. We go to a playground, and she buddies up with somebody that she’s never met before and, for that short span, they are the center of her world.

My heart is full of so many things. She’s a little person, interacting with other persons. We used to be her everything, my wife and me. We’ve delighted at the moments when she steps outside of our sphere. But will she always be eager to come back into it? No. I know that some days, as she gets older, she will not.

Enough of that. Today isn’t one of those days. I run after them, my arms aflutter like the wings of a moth. She sees me coming. She shrieks joyously. The chase is on. Wow, she’s fast now. She stops. A puddle. A split-second to consider, and then she’s in it. Up and down, soaking wet. The pillbug is rolling around still, and now so is my daughter. Somersaults in the dust and dirt, and she’s caked in it. She loves being caked in the dust and dirt. My crud princess.

Around and around, a frolic that seems it will never end until it suddenly does. She cries out.

“Spider webs!”

Spider webs, unlike mud, are unacceptable. She’s so unhappy. Screeching, snotty, overwhelming feeling. When she feels, she feels BIG. Not just the sad. The love. I’m not sure I’ve ever known anybody that loves as much as she does. I crouch down for a hug, and she grabs me as tight as she can. I hoist her up. It’s time to go. I wave a polite goodbye to the pillbug. I don’t know if it understands.

We come home. I set her down on the couch and bring her the blanket that she requests. And her plush snail.

\-

It’s December. 2025 has been a year marked by the unthinkable. Cruelty. Injustice. It has also been filled with beauty. Jasamine White-Gluz and Angel Marcloid have contributed to the latter by giving us *Bugland.*

I’ve listened to it again and again. I’ve read reviews, interviews. I’ve combed the lyrics, searching for some hidden narrative. I haven’t found one yet. But even if this album resists a clear storyline, it is steeped in lore. This world that they have created is alien, unknowable, and yet it feels like this place has a real history. It is an actual, tangible place. The buzzing wings, the mucous trails. The sounds that emerge unexpectedly; that feel alive. A crackling static. A wall of guitar. A dreamy, cascading synthesizer. A metallic rasp. It lulls you into a groove, and then erupts.

And then there is the imagery.

Garbage dream house. Bather in bloodcells. Crud princess. These are titles of songs, but also lyrics that appear elsewhere on the album. Are these repeated motifs? Incantation? I’m not sure, but they send me somewhere.

It’s hard to go to such places as an adult. Life is busy. There are a constant stream of words and pictures flashing at us. News stories, new offers, all jumping at us as we scroll. We sift through all of that obsessively, our world as tiny as the screens of our phones. How rare it is that we just see a corner of a room, or a spot against a fence, or anywhere, and just decide that it’s a whole other realm for us to visit. Kids do that all the time. They envision a place, and then they are there, playing. No Joy’s record transported me somewhere, so I wanted to think about it like a kid might think about it. I wanted to imagine my own kid going there with me.

Each sonic development was an opportunity for an event in this little journey. Each lyric was a suggestion of what we might do, think, or feel. Fictional, fantastical though this was, it came resemble one of our real life adventures. We go to meadows, to playgrounds, into puddles. There is laughter, there are chases, there are tears, and there are hugs. If *Motherhood* helped me to meditate on my hope to become a parent, *Bugland* helps me to meditate on being in the midst of parenting.

To be clear, I’m not advocating for climbing into a dumpster. Keep your kids safe! Keep yourself safe! But when you see an insect, an invertebrate, an arachnid, an arthropod, ponder for a moment what their world might look and feel like. That’d be a cool place to explore, right? Take yourself there. And if you need a soundtrack, put *Bugland* in your earbuds.

I bumped into her at a social event a couple of months ago and we decided to get drinks the following week. Well, we ended up talking about our ex-spouses exchanging a lot on how we cope with our separations. It was a a good talk but deeper than I expected. We ended up parting as friends.

I texted her about a week later and made some joke about our conversation. We ended up texting for a little while but I felt like I was putting more effort into it than she was so I just abruptly stopped.

As luck would have it, we came across each other again maybe a week later and we actually hung out and laughed and had good rapport but I had to leave earlier than expected.

The next morning I texted her I enjoyed hanging with her the night before that we should grab some coffee that afternoon. No response. That was about a month ago.

A couple of weeks ago, I got an invite to a party at a friend's house and found her name on the guest list and she accepted.

I'd like to spend some time with her but I'm thinking no response to my text means she isn't interested. Best case, I guess, is that she is interested but just didn't want to respond with a rejection. Who knows? 

We're part of the same social circles so it's inevitable we'll run into each other again. I don't want that non-response hanging in the air and making us both feel awkward. I guess it would also give me closure but I'm fine with not dating her. I have other options and have been dating other women.

I am thinking that, if I talk to her, I'll just apologize for putting her on the spot like that  in the text and move on. No hanging out; just a brief sentence or two and go mingle with other friends.

Last year I had to write someone up for posting a photo of their desk on Instagram. Just their desk. So I'm definitely not showing my face anywhere.

Been trying to make productivity content work since August. Time management tips, how to organize your day, that kind of stuff. Figured it couldn't be that hard.

It was that hard.

Started with text over stock footage. Coffee cups and notebooks. Nobody watched. Maybe 400 views per video and it took forever to edit each one.

Tried filming my hands writing in a planner after a few weeks. One video got 1900 views and I thought I figured it out. Made a bunch more. They got like 500 each. So I didn't figure it out.

Kept posting through September and October. Views stayed around 500 to 700. Wasn't great but at least it was consistent.

Then I bought better equipment because everyone said quality matters. Microphone for $95. Got a music subscription and some caption app. Was paying like $40 a month for tools. My videos looked way more professional.

Views got worse. Dropped back down to 400, sometimes 300. I literally spent money to go backwards.

My roommate kept asking how it was going in this voice like she thought the whole thing was pointless. It probably was. I'd been doing it for months and made zero dollars.

Few weeks ago I just changed everything. Made the videos look like an actual person talking instead of text floating around. Using CapCut for editing, APOB for the face part since I obviously can't use mine, and Riverside for audio. About $30 a month total so at least it's cheaper than before.

Views got better. Not consistent but better. Some videos get 5000 views, some get 1800. I still have no idea why. Posted two videos about morning routines last week. Same style, same length. One got 5800 views and one got 1600. Makes zero sense.

I'm at 1900 followers now. A productivity app reached out last week and paid me $100 for a sponsored video. First money I've made from this.

Told my roommate and she was like oh wow you actually made money. Yeah. $100. After four months. That covers my share of groceries for two weeks.

I still don't know what I'm doing. Some videos work and most don't. The algorithm feels completely random. I'm putting in maybe 5 hours a week and I can't tell if it's going anywhere.

The $100 is something but it's also basically nothing. I could've done Uber Eats on weekends and made way more without spending hours trying to figure out why one video gets 5800 views and another gets 1600.

But what if I quit now and next month I actually start making decent money. Or what if I keep going and it stays like this and I just wasted more time.

I'm tired of not knowing if this is worth it or if I should just cut my losses and do something that actually pays consistently.

        It is one of the hardest things to let go, and if you have no forgiveness heart, it is easy for one to become hateful and never capable of falling in this trap with never allowing yourself to fall in Love again. 
         It can rip your heart out and take away all the trust and faith that you ever gave someone while thinking there was nothing wrong only to find out that person had arranged someone else behind your back while never taking that action till the day they decided to part from you. 
          Such as making a sandwich and coffee for you with jokes and a goodbye kiss before you go to work always knowing that it was going to be that day she had plans of leaving you. In many cases even making love the night before. 
           The internet is a strong tool to access this new supply that one would never think that person was receiving this new supply and receiving ""Seat Nothings"" while giving her everything she wanted to hear making comparisons to what she has not heard in twenty four years. 
          Even though there was no fighting, you felt something was wrong and did all you could to make things up like bike rides, crackers and cheese on a deck with a bottle of champagne, making love move often, road trips to the mountains and dinners. It won't matter and is now looking as a sign of weakness.
         Her mind has been made up but she will still enjoy this game until the day comes. It's called Narcissistic and it is almost impossible to Change one from it.
          But that's ok, let her go, she will soon find ou that the grass is not greener on the other side, and you don't want to trust that person again because there would be too much doubt on your part, and trust would be unbearable to obtain whenever you left the house. 
          Take it from me, you will find another that will love and trust you for what you deserve. Good Luck.

Before this from the age of 14 to 34 I have never gone more than two weeks at the most without getting fucked up.. but it was usually multiple times a week  and entire weekend blacking out and snorting cocaine.

Alls I gotta say is I have not ever felt this good. Physically, mentally, and just my self esteem are thru the roof. I actually am starting to feel good about myself, and proud of who I am.. these are things that are foreign to me. I'm already achieving things I never was able to before.. Like the fact I am in the gym 6 days a week and starting to see results, I am a morning person now and I love it especially on the weekends, the high I get from being able to wake up at 8 and have a peaceful cup of coffee with a clear head is better than getting drunk and coked up any day. My diet has completely changed, I no longer am eating junkfood for half the week because I'm too lazy to cook because of my hangovers, I'm watching everything I eat and even counting macros. Me and my girlfriend hardly argue, and when we do, it blows over almost instantly.. when before it was world war 3 every other day in my apartment. I have even motivated several friends to stop drinking as well once they have seen how happy I was and how good I was doing!

Just wanted to check in and let you guys know how good this felt and if you are struggling in the early stages keep going because it does get easier! If you look at my post history you can see a big difference between this post and the one I made in the first few weeks. I'm only at 75 days but for me this feels like a huge mountain i've climbed.. I can't wait to see where I'm at in a year!

I assumed getting basic price and volume data would be cheap. After all, the blockchain is a public ledger, right?

I was wrong.

I looked at CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and CoinAPI. Their ""usable"" tiers (where you actually get enough API calls to build anything real) all start around **$35 to $79 per month**. As a student eating ramen, I couldn't justify burning $35/mo just to test an idea.

**The Realization** I dug into how these aggregators work and realized that for many use cases, they are essentially reselling public data at a massive markup.

So, I spent the last few weeks building my own indexer. Instead of relying on third-party aggregators, I found a way to query the blockchain directly for the specific data points I needed. It cuts out the middleman and drastically lowers the overhead.

**The Result: qoery.co**m I decided to polish it up and release it for other developers who are in the same boat. Because my overhead is low (I'm not running a massive corporate sales team), I can offer the same volume of data for about the price of a coffee.

Here is exactly how the math breaks down compared to the big guys:

1pk2i7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/beatles/comments/1pk2i7a/regarding_truth_of_the_anthologyand_why_its_more/,"Regarding ""Truth"" Of The Anthology-And Why It's More Honest Than You Might Think","The different cuts of the Anthology documentary (the 1995 ABC broadcast, the 1996 VHS, the 2003 DVD and the 2025 streaming version) actually all share a number of ""omissions"" between them.

\-Stu's death is not featured in any of the versions

\-Little mention of John's ""unpleasant"" pre-Yoko tendencies

\-No mention of Paul's various affairs/one-night stands during his time with Jane Asher (FWIW, Paul has continually said, when those are brought up, that neither he nor any of the other Beatles ever slept with anyone under 18, not even when they were teens themselves and they were arguably ""peers"" of 14-16-year-old girls in Liverpool, that they always knew ""that's something you don't risk."")

\-Practically no discussion of substance use outside of pot and LSD

\-No blow-by-blow dissection of the way the band broke up and the legal battles afterwards

So for all the quibbling about what was left out, the different cuts all share a lot in common with each other.

The coffee table book from 2000, which has just been reprinted, actually goes in a lot more detail, especially as it uses not just all the outtakes from the different interviews for the documentary, but also Paul, George and Ringo sat down for additional interviews just for the book, and Yoko provided a lot more archived print interviews of John to fill the gap covering all the various subjects.

The book actually features a lot of various elements, even rather difficult or heartbreaking or flawed ones, laid out: the manner of Stu's death, John punching out Bob Wooler (and John even mentioning hitting Cynthia), more about drugs such as John and Ringo's alcoholism and John and Yoko on heroin, George Martin describing his personal tiff with Phil Spector and Let It Be, more discussion about the situation and how the breakup occurred (from John announcing ""I'm leaving the group"" to the questions regarding which album is released first in 1970 to Paul filing suit and even the other three eventually suing Allen Klein themselves), and on and on.

Even then, the book does not go into surgical detail about the breakup or every allegation or insult or attack the parties lobbed at each other in the early '70s, and the story does not truly progress past 1970. But you don't need to see the gore to really understand what went down. It also doesn't do any good to really reprint all the dirt, especially when those bickering quibbles don't mean anything anymore, and it was more important that Paul, George and Ringo bask in putting their differences aside and enjoying their friendship.

With all that, the Anthology, in its various audiovisual forms and the book, is NOT a whitewash. The three of them, and John's old material, actually laid bare a lot of things, and they were quite honest and candid about it all. What ends up on the cutting room floor is not always a choice of ""feeding the myth"" and sometimes is more of an artistic choice by the team that put it together, for what ""plays good,"" what makes more of an impact.

There's also the simple fact that no two people will recount the same thing or event alike. So there were always bound to be differences in how each individual Beatle saw things. The saying is ""there's three versions of every story: yours, mine and the truth."" But try as we might, even with the efforts of Mark Lewisohn, there's no way to get the full ""truth"", because we always interpret that truth through our own biases and personal feelings. In short, there's no ""objective truth"" to be found out there.

But getting the story of The Beatles from the inside out rather than the outside in is something that we'd never had before, and it is an invaluable resource indeed. There may never be a ""definitive story"" of The Beatles out there, but this an important story that deserved to be told. ",25,1765472011.0,beatles,8,0.91,False

1pk2h09,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1pk2h09/went_back_to_radiocds_and_loving_it/,Went back to radio/CDs and loving it,"About a month ago I found myself searching for a charging wire. Actually, two charging wires. One was for my phone, and one was for the bluetooth speaker. Then I had to connect the phone to the speaker, and connect to the app. Then the app played an ad. All this to listen to the goddam radio.

I do not want a 'smart' speaker listening to me (and I do not have an amazon account). I do not want an algorithm to suggest crooner songs for weeks on end because I searched crooners that one time that my kid asked me what a crooner was. I do not want prerecorded sessions on satellite radio that I heard more than once in the same week promoting the music of whatever guest DJ is on that month. I don't want rely on wifi to get basic radio in the house.

I just... want to listen to local radio (I know all about commercial interests there too, but hear me out). I want the FM news/talk radio to tell me what team is town tonight and that I'm going to need my real winter gear to leave the house today. I want local traffic. I want to flip to the FM station that will play 9 Nonstop at 9 or whatever and to remind me to donate my old winter coats to a local charity. I live in a place where local radio more or less still exists, and still does this. And I want to be able to press a goddam ON/OFF button and for the result to be instant, no buffering, no additional ads.

So I marched myself down to the local electronics store and was happier than I have been in a while to find a little boom box. A BOOM BOX in 2025. It has am/fm, a CD player, and - can you believe it? - a cassette player. No, it's not vintage or used, it's new. It was less than $100 and the sound quality goes with the price, but holy shit, I love this thing.

It sits on my kitchen counter next to the coffee machine. I press 1 button, it turns on instantly and plays while the coffee brews and in ten minutes I've got weather, headlines, traffic and I did not scroll on a screen or fall into an email black hole on my phone. I did not stare at a news screen on TV. When I am ready to move to my desk (I work from home) I switch over to the listen-while-you-work station. The DJ announces the time every so often, it gives structure to my day. Saturday mornings it's the rock station that I used to listen to in my yout while I clean or bake. I have pulled out my old CDs and am listening to entire albums and old mixed CDs from back in the day. And NGL even the slightly tinny sound of the little speakers makes me nostalgic because it's the sound quality I listened all that music to in the first place.

My pretty little old school radio is plugged directly into the wall. If the power goes out all I need is either batteries, or a small power bank and voilà! No wifi, data, or cell phone battery needed to stay informed and get a little music going.

I have travelled back in time and am loving it. The local stations and rhythm of FM radio is like a soundtrack to the background of my life that I did not know I was missing since I switched to WFH and streaming music. It just doesn't flow the same way. There's less doom-scrolling or screen temptation because I don't need to pick up my phone, I'm hearing songs from CDs that never get airplay, I feel more connected to my local area, I'm not depleting my phone battery. No passwords, resets, updates, buffering.

I'll keep the streaming and bluetooth for better sound quality, on-demand listening, and podcasts. But MAN, that little radio has made me so happy.

1pk27wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Character-Finance335/comments/1pk27wt/agnostic_payment_gateways_for_california/,Agnostic Payment Gateways for California Businesses | Payment Flexibility,"alifornia is home to some of the fastest-growing businesses in the United States, spanning tech startups in Silicon Valley to boutique retailers in Los Angeles. Yet, many of these businesses face a common challenge: being locked into a single payment processor. Vendor lock-in can limit flexibility, inflate costs, and hinder your ability to adapt to evolving customer payment preferences. This is where agnostic payment gateways come in. They offer businesses in California the freedom to switch between processors, optimize fees, and maintain seamless transactions without disruption.

 

# What Are Agnostic Payment Gateways?

Agnostic payment gateways are payment solutions that are not tied to a specific processor. Unlike traditional systems, where your software or POS hardware locks you into a single provider, an agnostic gateway allows you to integrate with multiple processors, providing flexibility, scalability, and resilience.

For example, a Los Angeles-based e-commerce store can process transactions via Stripe, Square, or Clover without changing its backend software. This flexibility ensures uninterrupted operations, even if one processor experiences downtime.

 

# The Cost of Vendor Lock-In in California Businesses

Vendor lock-in can be costly. Many small and medium businesses in California pay hidden fees, endure long-term contracts, or face difficulties switching providers when rates increase. For instance, a boutique retailer in San Francisco might initially choose a POS provider with high transaction fees, only to find switching later nearly impossible without disrupting operations.

By adopting an **agnostic payment gateway**, businesses gain control over their payment strategies. They can compare transaction fees, take advantage of promotions, or even implement different processors for in-store and online sales.

 

# Payment Flexibility for Local Industries

California’s business landscape is diverse. Tech companies in Silicon Valley rely heavily on digital transactions, while wineries in Napa Valley or restaurants in San Diego often prefer integrated POS solutions for seamless customer experiences. Agnostic gateways enable local businesses to:

* Integrate multiple processors for online and offline sales
* Offer customers various payment options, from Apple Pay to traditional credit cards
* Reduce operational downtime due to processor issues
* Optimize transaction costs across industries  

For example, a Santa Monica coffee shop using an agnostic system can process contactless payments, loyalty card transactions, and subscription-based orders—all without changing its POS setup.

 

# Actionable Tips for California Businesses

1. **Evaluate your current payment provider:** Identify limitations and hidden costs.
2. **Choose a gateway that integrates seamlessly:** Ensure it supports multiple processors and popular POS systems.
3. **Monitor transaction performance:** Use analytics to track fees, speed, and reliability.
4. **Educate staff:** Train employees on flexibility features for smoother transitions if switching processors.  

 

# Conclusion

California businesses no longer have to accept the limitations of vendor lock-in. By leveraging **agnostic payment gateways**, companies gain flexibility, lower costs, and the freedom to scale operations as the market evolves. From tech startups in Palo Alto to restaurants in Los Angeles, adopting these flexible solutions ensures every transaction is smooth, efficient, and tailored to your business needs.

I Think something must be wrong with me 
The smell of my own blood calms me 
it’s always been like that 
I don’t know what my mother smells like 
I never have known either 
I have always had to taste myself 
Lick my own wounds with ferocious eyes 
Weary and weeping and weary and weep
The skin on my lips as snacks 
The ear wax as lotion to cover the dryness 
The cold shower water on my knee to drink crouched down
Saltiness floating over the lip into the mouth
Gliding down the unformed breast that was twisted and smacked and rubbed 
In front of the couch with the penny roller machine in sight
Placed on the coffee table just for me 
Animal 
Bathed in bleach
A fox walking downtown limping drunkenly thru a bank parking lot
A skunk outside of a city dumpster panting hysterically 
A coyote dying in a field curled up tight in the grass 
Out of place entirely lost
Injured ditzy rambling
But just a forgotten little thing 
hungry thirsty rotting
anxious scared hidden
Waiting to be pulled out to be sold 
Looked at adored played with toyed
Used
Indifference 
My life! My death!
Taken from me
A plant wilts 

It is selfish of me to act with such a large stake in my name 
In what I have left of me is all I’ve really had 
I’ve died on the hill of my body
I’ve tightened up and taken the beatings 
Felt the nauseating terror of being weak 
Of being so small and skinny 
Unknown hands covering the entire diameter and a half of my ligaments and of my throat 
Embarrassingly disconnected from the rest of the bones
Hands crushing wrists hands I hate crushing my wrists
The last fight flew out of me
The photographs of each degradation
my body! my skin!
My own earth on display with no glass to protect it
Humiliation ritual 
Age 7
It’s sick on sweat still
Never leaves 
Loud banter voices approaching 
Sounds stored deep 
In memory of closed eyed delirium
Talking about me
Laughing while the stars in the sky
Waited for me to do something
My name and body
All documents
I want to find out what was done
Where did I go if I was never missing 
My own mother is a pervert
Victimless pity 
If it hurts to say it 
The truth never gets blurrier 
Even when it makes sense 
And even when it’s seen with foggy tear soaked vision
You learn how to sell when you’ve been sold 
Maybe they saw it in her first 
The pictures can’t lie 
No matter if it’d be easier that way 
I can see it in the mirror 
The way it crawls across 
Dirty pus filled infected wound 
Bigger than the bottomless expression 
Her laugh the sound of sandpaper scratching on the fridge 
Seeing a rope as a snake
Slithering into itself
Giving birth to a baby girl born to be just like her
A curtain is closed
Sitting cross legged waiting in hell 
Feeling eyes still seething with greed 
Look down at me!
Like a poor animal of the earth in pursuit by hunters
Waiting in heaven 
Still watched 
Someone wants to break me
To stare at my naked shame 
To rearrange the scraps left behind from previous predators 
But nothing feels new to me here 
Nothing is uncomfortable 
Nullified reflection 
Dots inside of the mouth from chewing the cheek too much 
Stubborn ugly baby fat 
The habit of scratching 
Check check checking my body still bleeds
I’m still here!
How much did I cost? 
The vulture doesn’t check the wallet
If it smells dead blood
Numb resonance echoes in the slowness of my frame
Nauseating love like a knife tracing skin
Frozen in fear at first then cut 
Thru fresh flesh
Unripe with generosity and softness
They only liked it when I fought
Scared and trembling 
A common terror now I recreate
Love overfilled with vacancy 
Expendable emptiness learned too young 
With just enough time left to mourn for it

1pk24ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/moreplatesmoredates/comments/1pk24ge/thank_you_mpmd_community_for_cheering_me_on_but_i/,Thank you MPMD Community for cheering me on... but I thought it couldn't get worse,"Hey guys! Wanted to give an update and more details on what happened. I was sticking to strict no contact with my ex. We broke up because we couldn’t move in together, and it created resentment. After the breakup, we mutually agreed to no contact and stopped all communication.

Here's brief overview:

We respected no contact for months. The only exceptions were completely accidental, one brief bump-in before where we caught up a little (she expressed resentment but also said she still cared about me), and another time where I accidentally pocket-dialed her on Instagram. She called back and texted to check if I was okay. I explained it was an accident, and we both agreed to block each other on social media to avoid that happening again.

Fast forward from May to December. Last week, completely by chance, I ended up on FetLife because someone I’m seeing recommended I check it out. I was scrolling and unexpectedly found her profile. And that hit me in a way I wasn’t ready for.

I saw the photos I took of her, the ones she sent me when we were together… and even a picture of her in my car. What really shook me was seeing a close-up photo of her with my jizz everywhere, something I assumed was private and intimate. Obviously it sucked. Here's the full thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/moreplatesmoredates/comments/1phosrn/thank_you_moreplatesmoredates_community_but_i/

Then this week happened...

I had built a new routine, I was feeling better, making friends, and frequenting a café near my new workplace. I’d been going there for months, 45 minutes before work to read, during lunch to read, and after work to grab a snack. I loved the place. The staff gave me free snacks and refills, and I got to know them personally. They felt like new friends, and the service and coffee were amazing.

Tuesday I walked in and unexpectedly saw her behind the counter. She looked surprised and said, “Wow, long time no see.” I was caught off guard, mumbled “yeah,” grabbed my order, and sat down. It was short and awkward.

The next day I sent her a respectful text:

“Hey! Great running into you, I was honestly just surprised to see you after so long. I usually stop by that café on my breaks to read, so I didn’t want it to seem weird. It was nice seeing you, hope you’re doing well. And if it ever feels awkward, just let me know, I’d never want to make things uncomfortable for you.”

She didn’t reply.

I went back like I normally do as per the recommendation of my therapist (they mentioned it was a public space and my space too, and I agreed). She served me, and she initially tried to make my order to go. When I said, “It’s for here, I want to read, but if you want me to leave, I could,” she responded, “It’s fine that you’re here… it’s weird. I feel weird.” I kept to myself, read my book, and left.

A few hours later she texted me: “Don’t come back to the café.” Then she blocked me.

I feel devastated and more hurt, not because I wanted her back, but because I lost my routine, my reading spot, I even lost staff who had become friends. It feels unfair, because I wasn’t chasing her or trying to break no contact. On top of that she fucking posted pics I thought were intimate and were for me. 

Now I feel like I can’t even walk by the café without awkwardness. Every day I am forced to walk by it and I see my ex...

So… yeah. This week hit a lot harder than I expected.

I actually thought the worst of it was going to be seeing my ex's nudes and my cum on the internet, but somehow life still managed to surprise me.

TLDR
Saw my ex’s FetLife profile with intimate pics I thought were private, then randomly ran into her at the café that was my daily safe space. She later told me not to come back and blocked me. I don’t want her back, but losing my routine and safe place really sucks. Looking for advice and laughs

What is happening?,"  Things that have been happening lately (past several months) lead me to believe I just don't make her happy anymore. 
  I do small things in the mornings (making her coffee, making lunches, help pick clothes, etc) to help her get ready for work. I have difficulty waking up in the mornings and she's helped with that for so long. But she just stopped all of a sudden and said she's tired of it. I try harder, waking up earlier. My alarms wake the house more often than not. But it doesn't seem good enough. When I oversleep, or don't have enough time for everything, she gets mad and expresses I need to try harder. 
  This bleeds into other projects, like outdoor work (build projects not done well enough, I should be able to do certain things alone, stuff like that)  or the dishes. I should be able to know what she expects and do exactly that but then wants me to make the executive decisions doing it alone. I clean the house on the day we don't share off. I never really go anywhere. My hobbies have been put on the backburner for the most part. But I still somehow seem to do things aside from spend time with her too often according to her. She says I sleep too much. She says this has been building for years. We've been together for 5 years. 
  Just the other night, she took my phone while I was sleeping to go through it. I only found out because I woke up in the middle of the night to check my alarms. She's done this before. Last night, she asked if I was cheating after already going through my phone and having Life360. I've been faithful for all this time. I love her. I just don't seem to be good enough and don't know what to do from here.

And because I learned that I have a right to complain about work place treatment even if this employers tries to punish me for posting this, I am protected from retaliation by law to discuss workplace harassment, wage theft and more.
I have worked as a barista at Cholita Coffee 866 onderdonk ave 11385 for a long while now.  I have worked in the industry for 10 years and have never experienced something like this. The owner (who often works there) has stolen from his workers, harassed them, repeatedly mistreated them based on gender. He has also said racial slurs to those darker than him. He is not concerned with listening, understanding, learning and growing. On the countless occasions where issues have been brought up to him, he deflects and denies. Even when there are witnesses who heard him say otherwise. He has stolen money from his employees on multiple occasions. I’ve heard my male coworkers complain  about the owner making sexually insinuating jokes he casually and routinely makes. He lied to an employee on a shift telling them repeatedly to leave early, when confirming for the 5th time he flipped and threatened with consequences. Customers laughed because they heard him say to leave multiple times. During my year review he came into it trying to persuade me to quit, when I asked about my performance he stared at my blankly did not by his own volition give any specific performance feedback. He is deeply misogynist, his hatred of women is extremely concerning and unfounded. If he isn’t trying to sexually coerce a woman client he is actively making fun of them. He routinely gaslights his workers and customers alike. God knows what he does to people closer to him.
The owner lacks workplace boundaries & brings  interpersonal drama inside the cafe from his personal life to a degree that I believe is harassment. As employees we did not agree to mixed into his personal life. Women often come into the shop during working hours crying because of him. There is an employee he hired who he explicitly conveyed to me that he wants sexually/romantically. 
I brought this up to my supervisor at the time who sat in on Jane Doe’s interview. Shortly after my supervisor quit due to the mistreatment. Jane Doe was then hired. This is not to say Jane Doe has no merit, she does, but for a Boss/owner to hire someone he expressed wanting romantically/sexually is weird. 

I found out I was hired to appeal to an LGBT clientele. Yet, I alongside other visibly queer workers have felt a difference in how we are treated by him. It got so bad my supervisor had to quit because of it. There is gender based favoritism that affects ours scheduled hours. If we commit a mistake we are punished with hours being taken away or cold shoulder treatment. When confronted about he deflects and insists that we asked for those days off. 
On a work trip to Paris last March,  he neglected to communicate with the team which caused a strife. When it was calmly brought up by my supervisor he got visibly angry, deflected and neglected to apologize or take accountability for anything.
I can go on, I can give receipts, but im tried. 
If you care about where your money goes consider this information when you pay $10 for a speciality drink that has 40 grams of sugar on avg (I did the math).

The shop is named after indigenous women, the owner is neither indigenous or a woman and it does matter because of how he moves. 

Come to Cholita for a $10 drink paired with a side of racism, misogyny and diabetes.",113,1765470803.0,ridgewood,36,0.92,False

Eventually he asked me out for coffee. We agreed. When my friend found out, she got super upset and basically said I ""stole"" him from her, even though she never told him how she felt and he was the one who reached out to me.

Unnatural had been it's form, Shapes etched, and carved upon it's sides, to the colors it was stained. How long until a voice would break the silence from which he stared.

""Why don't you try opening it?""

Softer tone had been the voice of the woman that sat across from the child, One that had been watching him with a hint of curiosity, One that had been holding a clipboard and dressed in blue. One that had decided to try something new.

Still like the paintings she often watched, She couldn't help but feel herself begin to slowly nod off. Had it not been for the ticking of her watch, Twenty till midnight, twenty hours since she had been put on watch. Left to jump in her seat as the window behind her would shake. Quick she had been to get to her feet, Loud clacking of wooden shutters being forced open, As had the box the boy now gripped.

How loud had been the clattering of colorful pellets that bounced off every wall, the ceiling of the room, left to rain down to clatter once more upon both table and floor. The one in blue far more concerned with what had been happening outside this room. quick in her glance towards the boy that now held two halves of this box, one in each hand. Something she didn't have the time to think upon as she pulled free a colorful pellets that had become stuck upon her pinned up hair. One the boy soon learned it had meant to be food, one she now chewed.

""It's Candy."" The woman took a moment to slow her speech, to now spell it out.

""C-A-N-D-Y"" -Caught between trying to look towards the boy as she spoke, though her eyes having a hard time looking away from the window. Good reason for it, as muffled yelling was heard through the wall. One that only grew more clear the moment she pulled open that door.

Chaos was all one could even describe the scene. Several Officers having to force The Detective off one of the rookie officers. One that had been shaken, and in tears. Not from the bloody and bruised eye he'd just been given. Not even from the shock, or pain from the large chunk that had been missing from his shoulder, As he looked as if he had been left mauled by some wolf. No, It had been for what he had done.

""This Bastard shot one of our own, And you tell me to calm down!?""

Red in the face he had been, Even if he was known for having a shorter, fast burning fuse, All that knew him feared this wasn't going to end with a few knocks to the head. How the detective struggled, Managing to slip and break free, Only to be grabbed, To be caught mid air as he damn near mounted the man who had yet to be pulled back up to his feet.

""Let me go damnit! Don't any of you bastards stop me!"" For now, The Detective being dragged off, to be tossed into one of the empty cells to cool off. Wasn't the first time, damn sure wouldn't be the last.

Hysterical had been the one laying upon the floor. How much pity this woman now felt. How broken, must he of been to give such sobbing chuckles. Left to Stare into the eye that hadn't been swollen shut, For it to be so wide, so vacant, so full of tears. Left tightening the bandages upon his shoulder that had gone slack from the exchange. A glint of gold having caught her eye, In that moment she had come to a horrific realization. It was a crown that had come loose, To firmly wedge itself into the necrotic flesh of this inhuman looking bite wound.

She would become red in the face, for far different reasons as she now yelled at the officer that had been helping her try and get him on his feet.

""Why haven't you taken him to the hospital!"" As much as both tried, the officer refused to stand, instead electing to grip his knees, to press them to his chest and rock upon the spot, To whimper, To mutter to himself, to sob.

""If I am to be frank Ma'am, We did. With everything going on over there, between those wounded, and the bodies we brought back, Was told it would be best to come back within the hour""

""After Reporting in, that is. I patched the wound myself, He'll live till then.""

""We need to get him back there, before he loses his arm! Look at this!""

Fingers left to stick through the hole within the top of this officers sleeve, To firmly rip the whole thing free, to leave it to hang about the officer's elbow that showed no reaction. The arm already going pale, looking as if it had just recently started to loose circulation, as the veins that showed within the arm had started to run black.

No matter how much the other officers now tried, this one still refused to stand. The woman looking as if she wanted to pull her hair out now, Quick to make her way towards the medical cabinet to look for sedation. Left looking through the various vials of liquid as she held a syringe between her lips. Holding cells couldn't of been more then a few feet away, as a far more jovial, almost playful tone was heard, And the words that followed had been so thick, yet so crystal clear.

""I wouldn't do that if I were you, Not unless you want to be having a whole lot more trouble on your hands.""

She not even bothering to glance over at the one that spoke, ignoring him for now as she only hastened her search.

""All I ask is you bring me a cup of coffee, and I'll explain just why you should listen.""

Medical Cabinet slamming shut as the woman in blue had been quick to run passed the cell, not even bothering to glance at the one that had been speaking. Quick to vanish off to where the others had been left waiting, Voice of the Detective heard from the holding cell beside him.

""You're better off anyway, It's strong enough to wake the dead, If it doesn't kill you first.

Oh how this man would laugh, to echo within the space they both sat. To feel as if the very walls would shake, So deep it must of been forced up from the very tips of his toes. Least that was the impression the Detective as he spoke once more.

""What are you in here for anyway? Don't look like the usual type we toss in there.""

Seeing how this man had been sitting wearing a rather beat up and ripped tail coat, Should of been enough to leave anyone to raise a brow. The top hat that sat atop his head, looking as if some one had tried to flatten it, but failed really didn't help. The darker tone of his skin really didn't matter to the detective, Even if some of the folks outside of town might of been more sensitive to it. How carefree had been this man's expression as he spoke with a smile.

""You make a fine point, Mind lending me that coat of yours so I might better look the part?""

""How about you tell me why you're in here, Then maybe I'll listen to what you have to say.""

How dismissive had been the wave of this man's hand. Seeming to have found interest elsewhere.

""You've both had your chance, Now all I have to do, Is watch, Is wait.""

The woman nearly kicked off her feet now, The officer having grown violent the moment she tried to stick the needle into him, Wasn't alone as one had been thrown over the top of a desk, another into the wall. Needling curling up like a spring moment she tried to jab it into that had been his fully necrotic arm. How he continued to sweep, to chuckle even as his arms flailed about, lashing out at any that dare come close, Having ripped the revolver free from the holster of one he tossed. Not even looking towards the one that tried to sneak up upon him from behind, As he pulled the trigger, Clean through the shoulder as he now lay shaking at this feet. To fire a shot at any that dare try to move from there spot.

""Cah"" had been the sound to leave the woman's lips, As she dared try to speak. Cut off by the sharp whistling of the bullet that had cut across her cheek. For every shot this man took, once more left him weep. Haunted by all those he failed to see.

*Even now they try to approach me, To take another part of me. I know not where I have come to stand, For I have become trapped within the darkness of that very place. To become trapped with those things that try to take the form of man. For I know what they are, From where they come, For I dare not speak, For they have robbed me of my sight, Of my light. To trick me into losing my only protection.*

""I wouldn't do that if I were you."" The playful voice now warned.

The Detective having taken a moment to force the lock on his cell, Having been on his feet the moment he heard the first shot ring. By time the second shot rang out, from the cell he did spring. Back Pressed up against the wall, A moment to carefully check each chamber that had been within the cylinder of his revolver, As careful as he had been now that he checked around the corner.

*Forced to stare upon their faces. How could one ever imagine a face so twisted, the edges of their smile would touch upon their own temples. For eyes to have become so milky, so white, yet left filled with such darkness that makes this very place feel as if it was only night. Even now my tooth if left to ache, a grim reminder of that which bit me, of the very thing that now haunts my every, waking dream.*

One by one the boy had been picking up those colorful little pellets that had been called candy. For each color had brought a unique taste of it's own. Ones that he did not like on there own. For each he stuffed between his lips, did the colors, and the tastes begin to mix. For every one he plucked up off the floor, Lead him closer to that window beside the door. Left to watch the one that now held the gun. All left to watch that child step right through the very door. One tried to wave, The Detective wave, To try and get the boy to stop, Only to have his hand nearly shot. To watch that twisted thing now smile, To point at that child.

*I know not what I see, for it is something that was never meant to be. How can such a thing exist, How can such a thing come to be, For it to instill within me such a sense of peace. For I now know how insignificant my fear has been. For I have learned of things I shall never get the chance to speak, As I lie in wait upon this floor, for the one that shall come to take me away.*

""Should of listened."" The man called out from his cell, His laughter soon drowned out by the screaming of another.

""Damnit Jack! What the hell have you done!"" The woman on her knees, Applying pressure to the wound upon the downed officer's shoulder. All left to stare at the Detective left holding the still smoking gun.

My (20F) friend (19F) has liked this guy for a while, but she never made a move on him. They barely talked outside of group settings. Recently he started talking to me a lot more, and it was pretty obvious he was into me. I didn’t flirt back at first because I didn’t want to cross any lines, but I genuinely liked him too.

Eventually he asked me out for coffee.  We agreed. When my friend found out, she got super upset and basically said I ""stole"" him from her, even though she never told him how she felt and he was the one who reached out to me.

Now she’s acting cold and won’t talk to me. I’m stuck between feeling guilty and also feeling like what exactly did I do wrong?

1pk1ua5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pk1ua5,Half the man I used to be - 1  year on Mounjaro,"This will be long, as I kind of intend for this to be a document for myself to provide to people close to me who are considering taking this journey themselves.  The TLDR is I did well, you don’t have to read this novel.  =)

 

**The Journey**

 

In November of 2024, I was trying to make a change and started taking a walk every night.  I had a type 2 diabetes diagnosis back in 2022 but hadn’t really done much about it other than a few dietary changes which fell by the wayside over time.  The walks were intended to be a starting point in being more serious about it.  Additionally,  I had been having pains in my left foot whenever I stood up, but that pain would fade away to an ache quickly…within a minute usually.  I thought walking might help me lose weight and reduce or eliminate the pain.  Instead, the opposite happened.  My pain levels went through the roof and suddenly when I stood up, I had to do the “ah…ah….ah” walk putting weight on it gingerly.  My wife asked me if the pain in my foot was related to why diabetics sometimes get their left feet amputated and I freaked out.  It was not diabetes related by the way.  By coincidence I had a physical scheduled a few weeks later.  One of my friends had started taking Wegovy the prior September and had lost 40 lbs., basically changing nothing except his portion sizes (enforced due to nausea).  I figured, this was something I could manage, and I decided to ask my doc about it.

 

I met with the doctor, asked about Ozempic, and explained my pain issues.  She asked me what my goal weight was, and I honestly had not even considered it.  My starting weight was 321, so I picked 225 because losing more than 100 lbs. seemed like a fantasy, and what was the point of that?  I mean, even 225 was pushing the limits of reality in my mind.  I explicitly remember also saying that, like, if I could do a Thanos snap and make it happen, I’d pick 175 but that I realized that was just not realistic.  I had long ago internalized that I was a fat guy and honestly felt that could/would never change.  The diets I had done in the past never stuck, and I always ended up back where I started, sometimes worse than where I started.  My doc told me to limit my carbs, cut out soda, drink a lot of water and raise my activity levels and wrote me the script for Zepbound, which I hadn’t even heard of.  I almost got mad because I asked for Ozempic, but some quick research taught me she may have done me a favor.

 

It took a few weeks dealing with insurance rejections (my doc had done a PA for weight loss management, not diabetes treatment) but I eventually got the Mounjaro script filled and took my first shot on December 11, 2024.

 

All the advice my doc gave was good but after that I was basically on my own.  I decided when to titrate up and would message my Doc who sent in a new script.  There was no check in, or blood work done, which seems like the norm for many people here.  I had no idea what an endocrinologist was and had google it, lol.  I eventually found reddit and came here to get my advice and I appreciate this community tremendously.  I wish I had paid closer attention to the advice here in the beginning, I certainly did make some mistakes.

 

I was one of those people that felt it right away, like within hours.  My food noise went away right away, and I found myself forgetting about what snacks were in the pantry/fridge.  In the middle of a meal my brain would send a signal that I was….full?  What was this?  Prior to the shot my only indication that it was time to stop eating was when I felt stuffed.  When I see people here saying “OMG, is this what normal people feel like?!” I can completely relate.  I know how lucky I am to be so responsive.

 

After starting, my plan was kind of to do what my friend did.  See how the symptoms hit me and adjust my eating accordingly.  For the first few weeks I basically lived as I did before, eating and cooking the same types of meals.  It was possible because my symptoms were mild.  I lost a bunch of water weight the first week, as many of us do, and then (unsurprisingly) stalled the next two weeks.  In truth, my prior bad habits were overcoming the medicine, despite it’s efficacy.  In those two weeks where I stalled out, we had a child visiting, a second’s child’s birthday, my wedding anniversary, and X-mas, so I am giving myself some grace, but I wasn’t “leaning in” so to speak.  After Christmas came and went, I decided that I needed to take this seriously and began tracking my calorie intake and reducing my carbs.  I realized that I had to make conscious choices about what I was eating to succeed.

 

The month after I decided to “lean in” was wild.  I basically didn’t understand dieting (my previous diets were things like Atkins) and nutrition.  So, I started eating a lot less in general, without really paying attention to protein levels and whatnot.  I took a daily multi-vitamin, a calcium supplement and a Magnesium/D3 supplement and figured my nutrition was taken care of.  In the 30 days that followed there was a period where I lost 12.8 lbs in 7 days, 20 lbs in 14 days, and 29.6 lbs in 28 days.  I cannot stress enough how unhealthy this was.  I am so incredibly lucky that I didn’t have any kidney or gallstone issues during this time, but I was getting nothing but positive feedback from the people around me.  I was just like, yeah!  I’m working hard at it and this is how the medicine works, I guess. 

 

My first goal was to get to 279 lbs or 42 lbs. lost.  I picked this because Costco sells pallets of kitty litter that weigh 42 lbs. and every time I picked one up and put it in my cart I wanted to feel how much weight I had lost.  Honestly, hitting that first milestone is still probably my biggest emotional highpoint of the entire journey.  It signaled to me that this was going to work if I kept putting in the effort.  This milestone happened around 2 months into my journey.  Around that same time, I realized that my Plantar Fasciitis pain had diminished to the point where I would almost not feel it at all.  At best I felt nothing, at worst I had a dull ache that faded to nothing.  The pain had probably been gone for weeks, it’s funny how easy it can be to miss the absence of something.  This meant I could start doing my nightly walks again and I made sure that was something I tried to do every single night.  I’m not perfect, but I’m very consistent with the walks even today and I feel that this was a great help to me.  I don’t know that I burned a lot of calories with the walks, but they helped me to feel better about myself.  And in many ways the walks were a barometer for how seriously I was taking the journey.  If I was doing walks, I WAS leaning in.

 

As I said above, my first goal weight was 225 lbs. which I got to about 5 months from my start date.  Coincidentally, I reached that goal weight the EXACT day that I had scheduled a 6 month check in with my doctor.  She COULD NOT believe how well I had done and told me that she was the most responsive patient she has ever had on this medication.  That many times the patient follow up comes and there has been no, or minimal change in weight.  It was really affirming to hear because she had only seen the “before and after”.  I work from home, so I don’t see work people face to face and my family had seen the weight come off day to day, so the difference never seemed quite as stark.  I even heard the admitting nurse talk to my doctor before she came in saying “he has lost a LOT of weight”.  We went over what I was doing and she just kept nodding and said she wished every patient she had would make the same changes.  I think she was too quick to brush off the speed at which I was losing weight, but by this point I had realized it myself and had been making changes to address that.  When I got my bloodwork back from that visit, I was taken off Metformin, my blood pressure medicine, and my statin.  The only prescription medicine I take now is the Mounjaro. 

 

I reached my second goal weight of 195 lbs 36 weeks into the journey.  I picked that as my second goal weight because it was both in One-derland AND equated to THREE pallets of Kitty Litter.  Weight loss by this point had slowed, due to better understanding of TDEE, strength training and importance of nutrition and calories.  My final goal weight has shifted around the last few months of the journey.  I didn’t need to be a certain BMI for the sake of a number, but I read that your risk of many comorbidities is drastically lower if your BMI is under a 27, so that was really my final goal.  Get below a 27, with some cushion built in.  I’ve stopped focusing on a specific number to reach and am now working out how to maintain.  That is a new skillset, and one that I have struggled with.  It is quite a mental shift to go from a weight loss centered approach to a balanced maintenance approach.  I don’t have tips there because I am still figuring it out.  I did learn that loosening my calorie restrictions, while stopping my walks due to extremely frigid weather combined with a trip to the dispensary is not conducive to maintenance. 

 

I’ve gone from a 49.8 BMI (at my heaviest) to **a 24.9** BMI.  I’ve lost **49**% of my starting weight in 12 months, and 50% of my heaviest weight.  I actually like to think of my weight loss percentage in terms of my \***current**\* weight…so I’ve lost **96**% of that.  I weigh what I did in high school, even though that was never my actual goal.  It’s like time traveling back to the 80’s in a way, but with a lot less hair.  I brought out all the old clothes from my closet that never got thrown away.  I tried on club shirts from the 00’s (why did I ever buy silk flame shirts ffs), and clothes I hadn’t worn in over 20 years.  And almost all of it was too \***big**\* for me.  I had to buy a smaller belt, a much smaller belt.  Honestly, the hardest thing about this is just letting go of the fact that XXL and XL are always too big for me now.  That’s a weird thing to me.  People here often say they have body dysmorphia about the journey, but that hasn’t been as much of an issue for me in the day to day.  I avoided mirrors and pictures consistently beforehand but occasionally, I’ll catch sight of myself in a mirror by accident and will be startled.  The only time it really hits me is when I see old pictures of myself, and I find myself feeling some kind of way. 

 

I do have anxieties around my weight loss though, as probably many of us do.  I worry about losing health care coverage, as there is no way I could afford this medicine without it.  I worry that some new much cheaper but less effective drug will be released that fixes my A1C, but does nothing to control my weight, and that’s what my insurance will insist I take.  I refused to throw away all my old clothes because on some level I am just waiting for this all to somehow crash and burn.  So, I guess on some level, I still feel like the real me is that big guy from a year ago.  Maybe I do suffer from dysmorphia?  I’ll have to unpack that.

 

The physical side effects I had were generally mild throughout.  Constipation and burps were probably the only consistent side effects from Day 1 through today.  Constipation is easily managed, and burps don’t even register to me as a problem.  Maybe that’s just a benefit of being a guy.  I forget to even mention it as a side effect most of the time.  The only time I had anything other than mild symptoms was when I titrated up to 5 mg, but that didn’t last long.

 

I see this question come up a lot when people talk about their success, so I will just say upfront I have loose skin.  If that was your question, move on.  This question really irks me, not because I am dealing with it (I expected loose skin, and am fine with it), but because I feel like it’s too personal of a question to ask a person.  And it is an actual person making these post guys.  Would you ask this question in person to a stranger?  Maybe it’s unfair of me, but I feel like that questions about loose skin kind of translates to “I know you’re looking and feeling great and all, and you’ve had some great success, but underneath it all, are you actually still gross?”  Now I know that people asking this question are just dealing with their own insecurities and fears, but the way to deal with that is to make your own post asking these questions so people can engage if they \***want**\* to.

 

**What I did right/recommendations/tips**

 

I’ll start by saying, I’m only an expert on my own body and journey.  My tips aren’t meant to be universal

 

Advocated for myself with my doctor.  When I was diagnosed t2d in 2022 they didn’t mention anything about GLP-1’s to me and the medicine wasn’t even in a shortage at that time.  It was never mentioned in my yearly follow up visits.  If not for my friend on Wegovy I would never even have thought to ask about it.  It still rankles me that the conversation had to be started on my end.  They were like, you need to lose weight, here’s some metformin, cut carbs, good luck.

 

Deciding to “lean in” and take it seriously.  My friend on Wegovy was down 40 lbs when I started and has made minimal/zero lifestyle changes since.  He is down an additional 10 lbs a year later, but I know he could have done a lot better if he made more effort.  That’s his journey, and I don’t ever say anything to him about it, but I am glad I took stock and saw what was possible.  I’m also incredibly grateful for him because his success is what inspired me to start in the first place.

 

Tracking my calories was probably the MOST impactful thing I did for my journey.  I really had no idea what my true calorie intake was.  “Watching what I ate” didn’t translate to a calorie deficit.  Eating nuts/granola and yogurt seemed healthy to me, but I was eating too much of it.  I had no idea how calorie dense some foods were.  In my previous life I wasn’t steeped in CICO dieting, so this wasn’t triggering for me as I know it is for some.  For me, I could never have lost the weight I did without tracking what I was eating.

 

Mentally shifting Mounjaro from “magic potion” into a tool to help me build better habits.  Making changes in diet and activity were not a result of Mounjaro, they were changes I made.  Mounjaro was a tool that helped those changes stick.  On the same sort of track, I didn’t try to incorporate a ‘diet’ into my journey.  I watch my nutrition and proteins, but I don’t have any forbidden foods, nor have I tried to do Keto or OMAD or something similar.  I wanted to have something sustainable for ME when I was done.  Not a strategy that I found difficult that would eventually be tossed aside.  Been there, done that.  You should figure out what will work for YOU long term.

 

Cutting out sodas and increased water intake – before I would drink 2-4 sodas a day, every day.  I’ve told people that and they acted horrified, but it didn’t seem weird to me.  Now I get hydration from water and coffee…mostly water.  Soda’s taste so sweet it kind of sickens me now.

 

Daily walks, 2 miles a day at a minimum.  I try to get 10k+ every day but don’t beat myself up about it so long as I get my 2 mile walk in.

 

Reduced Carbs in my meals – Low Carb not No Carb.  You need carbs to be healthy, but now I eat half a small French fry instead of a full large fry.

 

I took Day 1 pictures.  I then took pictures every month in the same shirt.  It feels good to see the progress I made.

 

Get a smart scale and start a profile on Day 1.  I know the metrics accuracy is questionable, but it will measure trends over time.  It’s great to see that data over the long term.  I understand daily weight tracking can be triggering for some people, so this advice isn’t meant to be universal.  I had a smart scale but didn’t have a profile set up on my phone, so my earliest days are missing Body Fat percentages, BMI’s, etc….and it really bugs me now.  On my Ap my journey starts at 308 lbs instead of 321.  UGH

 

Kitty Litter Metrics – This may seem stupid, and I talked about it already, but every week or two when I get that kitty litter it’s a consistent reminder of my success.  I am not even sure I could lift and carry 3 (almost 4) pallets of kitty litter now, and I used to carry that around with me 24/7.  Given how much joy it has given me, I really do recommend doing something similar in your life.  Pick a goal that’s personal that can give you consistent affirmation.

 

I think that there is so much advice about how to get the most out of tirzepatide out there that it can kind of be a little daunting.  I do think the most important thing to do when you start is take the shot consistently, drink enough water and start at least tracking your calories.  I’m not even saying change your diet day 1, just start tracking what you’re eating honestly.  To me, this is the foundation of success.  All the other stuff you can transition into your plan over time.  As you see success, you’ll probably want to do more.  I mean if you are rearing to do more, please do, by all means!  I’m just saying, if you are feeling overwhelmed by ALL the things you’re reading to do on the journey, just start with taking the shot, drinking extra water, and tracking your diet.

 

**What I did wrong/what I’d do differently**

 

I kept my calorie count too low in the beginning, and I really didn’t know better.  The weight came off super-fast and I was naively happy about the rate of loss thinking this was how the medicine was supposed to work.  There was a point in the very beginning where I was losing a pound a day consistently for like 5 weeks in a row.  TMI, but my urine looked like popcorn butter.  I’m incredibly lucky that I didn’t have gall bladder or kidney issues.  I was so foolish and the only feedback I was getting from people in my life was positive.

 

Around 4 months in I started losing hair.  Like, quite a bit of hair, and was I super concerned.  That was part of what brought me to this sub-reddit as a regular reader, and not just an occasional browser.  I realized I had done myself a disservice by not focusing on my nutrition and macros.  The rate of hair loss slowed after a few months of consistently making sure I was getting enough protein.

 

I did not change my TDEE to account for increase in activity.  I kept myself classified as ‘Sedentary’ instead of ‘Lightly Active’ after starting my walks.  This mistake went on for months before I realized I should have budgeted for more calories per day.

 

I titrated up in the beginning because of minor stalls, not because the medicine wasn’t working.  So long as you’re losing at least .5% of your weight, averaged over 4 weeks stay put.  In the beginning, if I saw my weight stall out for 2 weeks I’d panic and want to move up.  I learned to ride it out, and the weight started coming off again in 2-3 weeks’ time.  If you haven’t lost in a month, and you’re not experiencing any negative side effects, move up then.

 

I focused too much on lbs lost, not enough on health in the beginning.

 

Weed and Mounjaro don’t mix…for me.  If I smoke, I get the munchies.  If I get the munchies, I will eat more than I should.  I will eat more than my TDEE for sure.  Almost every spike in my weight for the last year directly corresponds to me bringing home something from the dispensary.  Now I rarely smoke, it’s just too disruptive for me.  I’ve seen people say they don’t get munchies on Mounjaro, or if they do, they are satisfied with a moderate amount of healthy snacks.  I’m jealous of those people, truly.

 

I wish strength training had been part of my routine earlier, especially as some one over 50 years old.  I didn’t start going to the gym until month 7 or 8, and I’m still making up lost ground on that front.

 

I didn’t take starting measurements.  I am not sure how much my waist is reduced because I wfh since Covid and outgrew all my work pants.  I think I was around a 48/50 inch waist before, but I wish I knew for sure.  I wish I knew how much thinner my arms and legs are.

 

**NSV’s that have meant the most to me**

 

My wife says hugs are so much better now.  When I hug her, I can get in close.  Like, not a long arm hug with my belly in the way, where we touch foreheads.  A real hug, cheek to cheek where it feels like we are really next to each other and connected.

 

Originally, I was going to say I can wear my wedding ring again, but I’ve lost so much weight that now it is too loose for me to wear without worrying it will fall off unnoticed.  But, it was a treasured NSV for me for about 4 months.  I’m looking to get this issue resolved at the jeweler now.

 

As I started seeing results my moods lightened, and I have been able to feel good about myself.  My wife says she “has me back”, because I am just in a better place now and it’s affected the way I interact with the people in my life.  My whole life I tamped down my feelings about my weight and just engaged in an avoidance strategy emotionally when it came to dealing with it.  I can honestly say that I never even clocked my depression around the topic, because I had just resigned myself to being a fat guy.  If I couldn’t change it, why get worked up about it?  I do feel like myself again.  I have restored confidence.  I wish more people could have access to this medicine, because I have seen firsthand the myriads of ancillary benefits that can come from it.

 

My need for a CPap has been reduced, maybe eliminated.  My friends husband died from OSA in his sleep a decade ago, and it freaked me out so much I immediately got diagnosed and got the CPap.  But I had to forgo wearing it after some dental surgery in July and it certainly \***seems**\* like the issue is resolved.  I am waiting on a sleep study to confirm, because I am so scared of what could happen to me due to OSA.

 

This is a weird one, that I did not expect.  I have always played video games.  Since 2014 I’ve played Destiny/Destiny 2 consistently.  And by consistently, I mean I have over 8k hours of playtime in this franchise alone.  I usually play 1-3 hours a night after my wife goes to bed.  Since starting Mounjaro my desire to play this game just basically evaporated.  I have no desire to play, nor do I miss playing.  Clearly Mounjaro has changed how my brain processes dopamine in some way.  My wife is thrilled, and I am happy about that too.

 

Wrapping this all up, I want to say, it was hard to post this.  Partly because it’s difficult to put yourself out there, but also because I know that my results are not typical, and my heart breaks when I see people asking why it isn’t working for them.  I feel strangely guilty about how well I have responded on this medication, which has truly been amazing for me.  But I also have been inspired by posts like this one and wanted to contribute. Thank you to the 12 people or so that will have read this entire novel.  As I said above, I wanted a post that had my whole experience in one place.  If anyone I am close to wants to know what it was all like I can send them here.  Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.

Well, I found much more than I bargained for. This mental illness has opened my eyes to something so tragic that I never knew existed. Now I find myself mentally spent.

\---

January 2024, I was coming out of a divorce after a 12 year marriage. The relationship I had with my wife was filled with years of warmth, great communication and wonderful intimacy. We were each other’s best friends. Sadly, in the last 3 years of our marriage, my wife’s cyclical depression became unmanageable to the point that we decided to part ways. I was lost and heartbroken for months.

Now in my 40s, I found myself single and had the mindset that I will remain single for a long time. I was convinced I would not find love like the one I had with my wife. Remained single for over a year until eventually I had gone on several dates… and they all fell flat. Discouraged, I became very pessimistic towards relationships at this stage in my life. Then this past spring I met *her*. I found my beautiful pwBPD. Of course I did not know what BPD was at the time… and I was about to learn a really important lesson.

I joined some neighbours who occasionally meet for coffee. At this group is where we met and almost immediately hit it off. Soon, my pessimism turned to hope. How could I have found such a wonderful woman with whom I have so much in common? And to think, this woman lives just a few houses away. Serendipity! Ugh.

She was kind, generous, affectionate and, best of all, we wanted the same things out of life! She always made time for us and made it clear very early on that I was the guy she had been looking for all these years. And quickly, I felt like she was the girl I could only dream of finding after my divorce.

**Everything moved so quickly**

**One month** into dating I found myself spending most evenings with her. It felt surreal and almost too good to be true. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. All I knew is that her presence felt intoxicating.

**Two months** into dating and I started to fall in love. How could I not? I had never felt so seen, so appreciated, so understood. She anticipated my needs and I did my best to reciprocate. We were really building something here! This is something I had never experienced before. This is the kind of love I had only read about! Ugh.

**Three months** and discussions of future plans became common. She talked about moving in together one day. I suggested we consider it in a year or two. Immediately disappointed, she strongly urged me to consider moving in together very soon… in the next couple of months! That threw me off.

**Four months** is when I experienced the dreaded “split”. One night she asked if I could pick up a package for her on the other side of the city. I declined and suggested that I could go the following day as it’s close to my work. Uncharacteristically, she just walked away sullen and quiet. I followed her into her kitchen and was going to ask what was wrong as I began cleaning up some dishes then suddenly: “What the hell are you still doing here? Why don’t you just go home for tonight? Okay?!” Out of nowhere. I knew that she was upset and told her that I’d be up for talking about it later. I left and she did not reach out for the rest of the night.

What followed for the next 2 weeks is something I will never forget. Her presence turned cold. I was no longer appreciated and instead I was repeatedly told that I wasn’t doing enough. I wasn’t supporting her enough. These words have been tumbling around in my mind for weeks:

**“I thought you understood me but I guess not. You don’t understand me at all. Even after all the time we’ve spent together! I’m so disappointed.”**

Seeking clarification just lead to more blaming. Deep confusion set in. I had done nothing wrong and had only shown her love and respect. I distanced myself and told her that I planned on taking a few days to myself. After two days apart she invited me over for lunch. She sat next to me and put her head on my shoulder “I love spending time with you. I couldn’t imagine anything better than this.” My heart sank. What the hell is going on?! Ugh.

A week later her ex made reappearance in her life. The same guy who beat her. He’s back and, apparently they were get along great now! At first, it was just a few texts “checking in”.

I started searching online using terms: “Loving girlfriend suddenly cold” or “Intense love turned to silent treatment” and I ended up finding this subreddit. The stories here are uncannily similar. The red flags listed here line up with what I experienced. How could I have been so blind? It really was too good to be true.

The disgust I felt in my gut was overwhelming. After a week of thinking I broke it off. Four of the most beautiful months of my life followed by one month of confusion, anger and mistreatment. I still can’t wrap my head around it and I find myself ruminating.

It’s 6am right now and I am sipping on my coffee while I type this. I was just thinking about what she said to me just a few weeks ago: “You’re so great. I am looking forward to our future together. We’re going to have so much fun you and I.”

And now here I am, looking out my living room window I can see her ex’s car in her driveway. He’s been there every day for two weeks now. I have to adjust to this new reality. I am at a loss.",17,1765470463.0,BPDlovedones,5,1.0,False

I have never seen someone drink like this before and I can’t tell if it’s normal or not. Feel free please to weigh in…

When he puts a liquid in his mouth he swishes it around his mouth and seemingly uses his tongue to make sure it goes around his gums (in front of his teeth)… essentially he treats it like mouthwash. Then he will swallow it. When he drinks as well, instead of keeping the cup semi-raised between consistent sips he will pick up and put the cup down fully between gulps. This is water, soda, coffee… everything.

It just drives me mad. So much movement and sound for each sip. I have always drank by simply sipping the drink into my mouth and immediately swallowing it, or holding it in my mouth for a second or two at best but I don’t swish it around. I tried it myself to see if I was missing out on something but it just felt strenuous to do all that every single sip.

1pk1ped,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalmedium/comments/1pk1ped/leg_pain_how_to_reduce_it_or_fix/,Leg pain how to reduce it or fix,"Hi dear community. I am currently on MM morning routine for 7 months (LW, CJ, raw fruit breakfast), no foods (only level 3, so I do eat fats and beef and still have coffee), I started whole mm due to severe lichen sclerosus and fibromyalgia. (Maybe I have to add I was on keto for 7 years before that and switching to so many carbs is already a huge thing for me). I don't have improvement so far with these exact things (however my cholesterol in blood went down from high to low so of course some not visible things improved). But what I started having recently is leg pain (a month ago to be precise), I can not describe it, it is not in muscles like with fibro, it is like nerve pain or under skin, it is fluctuating and I started thinking already I damaged something in my spine. Can this be virus related? Can healing reaction be this long? Location-wise it is everywhere on legs (front, back, calves, ass, ankles) and I never had it before or anything similar before. Please share if you had similar issue and if something helped to reduce it🙏 ",1,1765470162.0,medicalmedium,0,1.0,False

My and my now ex (both 20) met last year at University and started formarly dating on December 26. Everything went amazing, but on August ive sensed something was off and we went for a coffee and she told me there were certain things about me she didnt like, like I wasn't paying mich attention to her, we werent seeing each other a lot (mind u we saw each other EVERY DAY AT UNI and talked and texted all the time) and i wasn't affectionate enough and that.


So the next MONTHS i started to do things. Bought her coffee, we went on dates, birthday parties, even went to the cinema and HAD SEX.


So everything was great right? So a week later she broke up with me because of the same things,  its as iif even thoughI tried she couldn'tsee my effort. She told me she didnt want someone with 'those qualities' in her life, but she told me she loved me and wanted to stay in,touch and with my family and all. This was October 3rd.


The next month I was feeling like shit. I texred her crying every 2 days and couldn't even work properly, i was honesteoy bedrotting. Later that month SHE INVITED ME to a coffee and talking and i told her i couldnt be her friend and I wanted to improve and she told me ""me too, i cant see myself not being your partner"".


On november SHE INVITED ME to a show she was signing at and i went and later she toldme about how it was best for us to stop talking. I told her I wont see her again until next year and she said ""Well maybe we can see each other before December ends"". I dont understand her.


After some pretty rough days of watching her Instagram and Pinterest I decided to block her. That was 2 weeks ago. I texted her telling her that and that I was gonna wait until end of January to see what we would do. She started talking A LOT about how there was nothing to talk about and her mind was made up day 1 (A LIE LOL) and even if I promise her i wont change cuz i was too late to change things. I told her ""Im gonna change for me, goodbye"" and she satarted yapping about ""yeah i know u can"". What a full of shit.


In the past weeks i started going to therapy, reading, meditating, adnd honestly I'm still thinking about her a lot. I dont understand cuz she says shes done but then she did all those (and many more) weird things. Some part of me still wants her back, but not as in October, idk its kinda weird now.


What i get really mad about is how she couldn't see all the things i did for her and many more when she told me about them. Its like she is blind for what I did at the beginning and everything else, she just cant see it. Im scared she's 100% made up cuz idk I still think we can work it out if she wasn't so closed off. She just doesnt trust me  idk. And I'm scared she will think ""yeah he will never give me what i deserve, im happier like this"", idk it's just so childish.


Idk some part of me still thinks she will get around, she has to, but idk anymore. And as I dont have any way of communicating or knowing what shes doing, lately ive been getting to the conclusion that WE ARE DONE SHE HATES ME ILL NEVER GET HER SHE FORGOT ABOUT EVERTRHING WE HAD, and idk its tiring man


Today I saw her Pinterest  and saw she was posting some vision board and romantic stuff and it hurts I dont understand it. She has to text me someday right?? Yesterday she went to a friends birthday party and last week too (i,know cuz of mutual connections) and it makes me sad knowing im the only one whos devastated


Im just tired lol
