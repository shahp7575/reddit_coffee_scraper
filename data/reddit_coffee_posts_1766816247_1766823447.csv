When I was 23 my father passed away unexpectedly, and a couple months later my mother announced that she was dating someone new, I got mad about how fast she moved on when she should have still been grieving. My mother and I had a falling out and i haven’t talked to her since. 
   Now I met this guy we will call him Rick, at a comedy show the local bar hosts every Wednesday, Rick walked over and asked if he could buy me a drink, he seemed kind enough so I accepted. After that we started chatting and we found out we actually had a lot in common. At this point it was around 3 AM and he asked if I wanted to go to his hotel room because he said he lived out of state and was here for a wedding. We were hitting it off and he was a good looking guy so i said yes. When we were in the car things started to get a little spicy, he was driving and he placed his hand in my thigh, my heart started racing but I didn’t react.
   Just then he started moving his hand farther up my thigh, just before anything really happened we arrived to the hotel. We opened the door and he stared at me, he walked over slowly unbuttoning his shirt and well you can put together what happened next.
  We woke up the next morning to a banging on the hotel door, Rick got up and put on some pants and walked over to the door. He opened it a bit to say he’s busy when a lady bursted through the door screaming, I looked up still naked with only the blanket covering my when I see my mom, she started screaming when through all that chaos I realized she was telling me that, that was her husband. 
  I felt disgusted I put my clothes on and just left. I sent a text to my mother the next day apologizing still feeling horrified. I went to a coffee shop to clear my head I still feeling horrible for what I did. What do you guys think.",0,1766821528.0,AITAH,5,0.5,False
1pws5b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1pws5b3/bt_riverdale_estate_aroma_taste_is_gone_after_4/,BT Riverdale Estate Aroma taste is gone after 4 days of opening the bag,"I bought a Riverdale Estate Aroma coffee beans from a nearby Blue Tokai cafe, which was roasted on December 4. After resting for 14 days (as recommended by BT), I opened the bag and brewed it using a French press, and it tasted really great. The taste continued for the next 2 brews, but after that, in every subsequent brew, the coffee tasted flat.

Nothing has changed. I was grinding using a chestnut C3S at 20 clicks. Using 20 g of coffee beans and 300 ml of boiled water.

I even tried grinding at 22 and 24 clicks, but that also didn't help.

I asked Gemini for help, and it suggested some changes, like using fresh water that has not previously boiled and trying the Hoffman French press method. I did all that, and it improved the taste slightly, but the taste is not the same as the first 3 brews.

One more thing Gemini suggested is grinding a little finer at 16-17 clicks, which I haven't tried yet.

Regarding the storage of coffee beans. The coffee beans were stored in the original packaging, and it was properly sealed.

This never happened with me before, so I don't know what the issue is.

1pws1ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1pws1ol/oops_then_came_the_snow/,"""Oops..."" Then Came The Snow","The security team stared at me, mangled, broken, shivering while lying in the hospital bed. They looked at me. I looked back at them through the bruises.



""The human said... 'Oops...' And then... Snow... Everywhere."" I said.



The two shared a glance and nodded. ""We are going to need more than that...""



""How's he doing? He was caught in that avalanche too."" I asked with a shiver.



""Two broken legs and a punctured lung. He's awake and flirting with the nurses, but he's almost as screwed as you are."" One remarked casually.



""I would be even more mangled and broken than I already am were it not for his quick thinking, but then again it was his fault. I think. I am unsure of why."" I said between pains.



""Then talk us through it. Maybe we can figure it out."" The other asked.



It all started when we were on a corporate holiday from our company. We decided to do this in winter. For some reason. Jerry said the bracing air would be good for us. I did nothing but freeze my scales off. But the truth was, the trip was fun. It was entertaining until the dangerously large quantity of snow bashed me in the face.



We arrived on the outskirts of the snowy winter planet known as 'Gnome' which was a joke, a play on words with a place in Alaska on their homeworld apparently. There was even a giant statue of a thing they called a 'garden gnome' at the starport entrance. Our entire department, six men from one of the different empires all working in the same office. Ragnarth, Kolb, Canith, Kath'Harn Jerry and myself. Ragnarth immediately wrapped himself in three layers and shivered in annoyance. Kolb seemed unphased and carried on pretending the sidewalk was interesting. Canith and Kath'Harn had never seen snow before so were playing with it. I was wrapped in two layers but was comfortable and Jerry simply hailed a shuttle bus.



We all piled into the vehicle and headed towards the Lodge, the fancy hotel the company paid for to host this little holiday. It was actually more a holiday than anything else. The next day first thing we would be at the local convention centre to attend some business seminars and programming language classes. There's apparently some new hardware out and we need to be sure we can work with it in case the company decides to upgrade. The lodge... By the Ancestors, 'cosy' doesn't even begin to describe the place.



Ragnarth instantly calmed down and headed straight for the house coffee shack, with Canith hot on his scales. Kolb and Kath'Harn headed to their suites on the upper floors and I gravitated towards the oversized wood burning fireplace. I ignored my room for now. The roaring fire and snow made all this seem... dreamlike? I think. I had no real words. It was strangely calming. If there is anything I can say about humans, they know how to make anywhere feel like home. We all checked in after getting settled and wandered about. We had some minor issues with the locals, in that this place was almost entirely humans and we were the only aliens most people here ever saw.



Humans are after all still relatively new to the galaxy. So the first thing that happened was we were swarmed by curious onlookers and barraged with a thousand questions. Some of which were... only mildly offensive. Jerry was there to calm the crowds down and eventually make them leave us in peace. I still remember that crackling warm fire... You often forget the simple things when you live the way most people do. Anyway, to the next day. A good evening's sleep followed by a day full of corporate lawyers, silly slogans and politic-speak bullcrap that's infamous among the corporate world. You know the type. They use words like 'synergy' and 'optimisation'. Strange creatures...



The day eventually ended but we all gravitated towards that roaring fire and cosy coffee shop. Ragnarth and Canith had to be dragged away from it at the end of the day because they were getting the shakes. Then this morning arrived... Jerry dragged us to the slopes to 'enjoy' some winter activities. Said it was a big part of the entire resort to hit the slopes. Whatever that meant. As it turned out winter activities were things called skiing, snowboarding, ice skating and snowball wars. Or whatever they were called, among other things.



Ragnarth bailed on us immediately and went back to the coffee shop, citing the freezing temperatures. We didn't hold it against him to be honest, Daktharians aren't known for their resilience to cold. Kolb and Canith decided to go try out the ice rink for that skating activity. turns out the ice rink was just a frozen lake demarcated for the task by authorities. When we got there we were mesmerised by something incredible... A human female spinning in a perfect point on the ice at absurd speeds.



She was standing at exactly one point, her body tight in and rotating at dozens of revolutions a minute, faster than any organism ever should, nothing but the tip of the blade of one of her 'skate' shoe things touching the ice. Then, like a phantom she just stopped her spin and using the momentum, catapulted herself with unimaginable grace backwards towards other sections of the ice to join other skaters. This convinced Kolb and Canith to try their own hands at the sport almost instantly and before we knew it, they were at the beginners' area learning how to stand on their skates. Not easy. Especially for Canith, who has four legs.



Kolb however had a very easy time of it. The tail... It gives balance you see. He still fell on his ass a dozen times over but he still got it eventually. Eventually. Jerry, Kath'Harn and myself went up to the slopes. The ride up there was nice and calming, strangely enough. They have this dedicated lift device thingy that does the job. Can just put on skis or snowboard and just sit down as it approaches, then it carries you towards the top of the slope. Genius. Have you seen how those things even work? Superb machines!



Back to the tale. I went with Jerry to the beginners slope and we sat through a forty minute safety lecture. I should have listened. I should have. Jerry made sure we were okay and went to the other slope. I had no idea why but the sight of so many people just gliding down those fluffy freezing mounds of snow was something mesmerizingly beautiful. I wondered how it felt. Probably explains why I got mangled, I was too hypnotized to pay attention to the lecture. Eventually I went back to reality and received my first lesson. It wasn't easy but I learned, eventually.



So many things to know about just putting a plank of wood under one's feet and gliding on the snow. Do you have any idea how intricate this sport is!? Apparently for some its a form of legitimate competition. I need to be here next year for the so-called 'Winter Games'. Some people do this professionally apparently. I wonder what they do... Anyway, I ramble again. As stated I should have been paying attention to the safety lecture and I did not. By the time I was ready for my first time on the slope, Jerry had returned and was gearing up for another go.



This is where it all went wrong. I started to slide. I got hit by the excitement. Then I started picking up speed. It felt better than I could have imagined as I felt the cold air flow over me. Then I picked up more speed. Then I started to get a bit scared and tried to do that thing the instructor taught about how to stop. Then I remembered, I didn't hear that bit. Like a WadRat, I wasn't paying attention and missed the 'how to stop' part of the safety lecture. I thought I saw a safety barrier or something, or maybe a passage to a softer slope that would give me more time to figure it out.



As it turned out it was in fact a break in the treeline that led into an area that had been cordoned off for avalanche safety... Jerry miraculously spotted me and cut into the clearing as well to intercept me. I remember flailing about and trying everything to stop or slow down, nothing worked. I screamed for help. The slope was steep, far too steep, and I was picking up a truly terrifying amount of speed. So much speed in fact I could feel parts of my skin start to melt off despite the cold. I couldn't move beyond screaming for help. The force of the wind hitting me was also stopping me from flailing about. I had no strength for this task.





The terror really hit me. I began to panic as I noticed a rather inconveniently growing tree directly in my path, and I was heading straight for it at bone shatteringly high speed. I then felt a thump, and seconds later I started to slow down. I looked and there was Jerry, using his own skill and bulk to slow us both down. He redirected us away from the tree, its branches smacked against us, giving me that strange cut on my upper head. We slowed down and came to an eventual stop, gently fluffing the snow into a drift in front of us as we came to a slow halt, then plopped down.



I slowly stopped screaming and started to laugh hysterically along with Jerry as we sat in the snow coming down from the strange high I was feeling. It was... Magnificent! Exhilarating! Incredible! The speed, the snow, the cold chill. I felt... Alive! More alive than I had in two centuries! I don't know if Jerry was excited too or if he was just laughing to stop me from biting him or something, I don't know, I can't remember. We started standing up and making our way towards the other slope.



I saw instructors and observers at the edge of the treeline watching us. I remember apologising to Jerry when I heard an... ominous rumble. Someone screamed a word I had never heard before. ""AVALANCHE!!!"" Then I saw the spectators nearby scramble away from the edge of the treeline. Jerry started to panic and drag me towards a small rocky outcrop nearby. We didn't quite get there in time. I looked up at the cliff above us and there was a wall of powdery white heading straight for us.



Jerry said ""Oops!"" as he lost his grip on me and slipped a bit down the slope.



Then... Snow... Everywhere. Just... Snow... I felt bones break, skin snap, and my head roll into freezing snow before I could respond to anything else. The world went dark, I felt like I was upside down and left side right all at the same time. I just saw darkness, every move was pain. I started yelling for help. It came quickly and the first thing I saw was Jerry's face as he started digging me out of the snow. I can't remember the rest. It happened too fast and I apparently passed out just as I was put in the ambulance. Jerry was also hauled off to the hospital. As tough as humans are, he still got tumbled about like a twig thanks to the snow and was hurt too.



I finished recounting my tale to the officers, now thoroughly bored but attentive.



""So... Does that mean you want to press charges or file a complaint against the establishment or anything? You are entitled to that if you recall under the Cultural Exchange Act of-""



""OH HELL NO!"" I bellowed loudly.



They both looked at me with shock in their eyes. ""You don't...?""



""I want to heal up and get ready for the retreat next year! I WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN!"" I yelled happily, annoying the nurse.



I was glared at like I was insane. They shrugged, and left.",11,1766821069.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

1pwrzf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultADHDSupportGroup/comments/1pwrzf0/am_i_on_the_right_treatment_for_these_symptoms/,Am I on the right treatment for these symptoms? Looking for perspective,"**Hi everyone (26M, Indian),**

I’m looking for some perspective because I feel confused after consulting two psychiatrists.

Both told me that **adult ADHD is very rare** and that my issues are mainly due to **anxiety, overthinking, or stress**. While I respect their experience, the explanation didn’t fully resonate with me because my struggles feel very **functional/executive**, not just emotional.

# My long-standing symptoms:

* Severe difficulty **starting tasks**, even when I know exactly what to do
* Strong “**I know what to do but I can’t start**” feeling
* Executive dysfunction (planning, sequencing, follow-through)
* Procrastination until urgency/fear kicks in
* Brain fog, mental clutter, and **thought flooding**
* Focus comes in very short bursts (30–60 seconds)
* Easily distracted, especially by phone/screens
* Strong urge for background noise while working
* Dopamine-seeking behaviors (screens, food, stimulation)
* When I sit at my desk, my mind feels **extremely heavy**, like a 1000-kg weight — I physically can’t sit and work
* Productivity has dropped significantly (others have noticed)
* Emotional swings (small lows feel overwhelming, small highs feel very exciting)
* Restlessness and mental switching, but **no anger or impulsive aggression**

# A recurring pattern:

When I try to work at home, my mind fills with other tasks. I feel sleepy, crave sugar/salty food, want background noise, or get urges for porn.  
My brain then “decides” that going to a coffee shop will fix everything. I go there, sit down, and for 10–15 minutes I’m confused about what to do. Then a sudden urgency hits, the task feels huge, and I feel like I must go home to finish it.  
Once I’m home… I do nothing. Sitting at my desk feels impossible.

# What I don’t struggle with:

* Anger issues
* Impatience in queues or public places
* Aggression or irritability

# Medication:

One psychiatrist started me on **Atomoxetine 10 mg (Axepta)** and asked me to stay on it for at least a month. I’ve been on it for \~2 weeks.

So far I notice:

* A strange “brain paused / blank” feeling
* No improvement in focus or task initiation
* Still feel restless and sleepy at times
* Slight emotional flattening
* Cravings slightly reduced

# My confusion:

* If adult ADHD is “very rare,” why do so many adults describe experiences exactly like this?
* Can anxiety alone cause such severe **task-initiation paralysis** and mental heaviness?
* Is starting Atomoxetine at 10 mg reasonable, and is it normal for benefits to take weeks?

I’m not looking for a diagnosis — just trying to understand whether this sounds more like **ADHD, anxiety, or an overlap**, and whether it’s reasonable to seek another opinion if things don’t improve.

Would really appreciate input from clinicians, ADHD adults, or anyone with similar experiences.

The trending topics exploded for three days straight. My DMs were flooded with mock funeral wreaths sent by his fans.
I was being cyberbullied to the point of wanting to delete all my accounts and quit the industry.
I was just about to find my online boyfriend to cry to.
But before I could even type, he sent me a screenshot, followed by a whiny, self-pitying voice note.
Babe, some D-list actress is trying to score points with me! Im furious!
My hands trembled as I clicked on the screenshot.
There, in stark white text, was Asher Flynns comment tearing me down: @Rowanstay in your lane. Youre sickening to look at.
Wait. No. The gentle, attentive online boyfriend who tucked me in every night...
Was actually the A-list actor, Asher Flynn?
This relationship just hit a dead end.
1
Ashers messages kept flooding in.
Babe, why arent you answering me?
Did you see that trending topic, too? Dont believe it for a second. I have absolutely nothing to do with that Rowan girl.
Her profile picture is clearly a rip-off of yours, a cheap knock-off. Ugly people always try too hard.
If my manager hadn't stopped me, I wouldve sent two more tweets to knock some sense into her.
My fingertips went numb looking at the relentless stream of messages.
Ten minutes ago, I was sobbing hysterically because of Ashers tweet.
He said I was desperate for attention, that I was calculating, and that just seeing me made his stomach turn.
The entire internet was laughing at me; his fans had cursed my ancestors.
I had even drafted my retirement statement, planning to move back home and sell artisan coffee from a food truck.
And now, the man who caused all this mess was using a pink-and-blue teddy bear couples avatar and texting me, begging for affection.
Babe?
He sent another voice note, his voice deep, gravelly, and laced with a pathetic neediness. Dont be mad, I only slammed her to prove my loyalty to you.
Proving his loyalty by tearing me to shreds?
I took a deep breath, my fingers shaking as I typed: Im not angry.
Asher replied instantly: Thank God! You scared me. I thought you misunderstood that I had something going on with that flop. That kind of woman? I wouldn't touch her with a ten-foot pole.
I looked at my reflection in the mirroreyes red, hair a mess.
Babe, I have to film a reality show tomorrow. Its going to be busy, so I wont be able to reply right away.
And that Rowan girl is apparently going to be there, too. Seriously bad luck. Dont worry, babe, I promise to stay miles away from her tomorrow. She wont get a single drop of my limelight!
Asher sent another heads-up.
But tomorrow?
Wasn't that the day we were both scheduled to be on The Ultimate Challenge?
I had held onto a sliver of hope, thinking I might use the show as a chance to explain things to him, or maybe just apologize for the clout-chasing accusation.
Now, it looked like I was walking into a firing squad.
If he ever found out that the Babe he cooed to every night... was Rowan, the actress he publicly despised.
The image was too awful to contemplate.
He would likely feel betrayed, and his disgust for me would only intensify.
Okay, you do your thing.
I hit send, then flipped my phone face down on the table.
My manager, Brenda, pushed the door open, her face etched with worry. Rowan, are you still going to the set tomorrow? Asher Flynns team is putting out feelershe doesnt want any interaction with you. And the network will definitely play this up for ratings.
I gave a bitter laugh. The contract breach fee is three hundred grand. Can I afford that?
Brenda sighed. Right. Just keep a low profile tomorrow. Try to avoid him. Don't give him any more ammunition.
I doubted I could avoid him.
Brenda, I suddenly asked, if... and I mean if... I wanted to quit, could I pay the termination fee in installments?
Brendas eyes widened. Are you crazy? Because of this? Hey, being a villain is still being famous!
I didnt answer.
This wasnt about being famous, even if it was infamous.
This was about total, public humiliation.
If my identity was revealed tomorrow, my career in Hollywood was over.
Worse, Ashers fans might actually tear me to shreds.
I picked up my phone again and tapped on Ashers profile.
That pink-and-blue teddy bear avatar suddenly felt like a punch to the gut.
I had to end it.
But before the breakup, I needed to survive tomorrows show.
I could not let him recognize me.
As long as I denied everything, he would never know his Babe was me.
With a resolved mind, I locked down all my social media accounts and changed my profile picture to a solid black square.
Asher sent a stream of question marks: Babe, why the new picture?
I replied: Im in a bad mood. Ive gone dark.
He sent a big hug GIF: Who upset you? Tell me, Ill go rip them a new one!
I stared at the screen and forced a smile.
It was you who upset me.
Werent you cruel enough already?

On the set of the reality show.
I huddled in a corner, trying to shrink into invisibility.
Asher Flynn walked in, the center of attention. He looked impossibly handsome in a black outdoor jacket, the kind of man you couldn't tear your eyes from.
But the air pressure around him was freezing. His face clearly screamed, ""Do not approach.""
He walked right past me without stopping, not even sparing me a side-glance.
Sierra, the current It Girl and another female guestand, in Ashers fans minds, the only acceptable girlfriendsmiled sweetly at the sight of him.
Asher, long time no see, Sierra greeted him with a sugary voice, naturally shifting closer to him.
Asher gave a noncommittal grunt. His attitude wasnt exactly warm, but he didnt push her away either.
Sierra then turned to me, her face plastered with an impenetrable fake smile. Oh, look, isnt this Rowan? After yesterdays blow-up, I honestly thought youd be too embarrassed to show up today.
Her voice was just loud enough for everyone around to hear.
All eyes instantly pivoted to me.
I clenched the hem of my jacket. I signed a contract. Of course, Im here.
Right. Well, this might be your last time on a high-profile show like this, Sierra said, covering her mouth with a delicate laugh. You have to seize the chance to get as much screen time as possible.
I didnt take the bait.
The less I said, the better.
Asher suddenly spoke up. Whats with the small talk? Can we be professional?
Sierra instantly nodded submissively. Ashers right. Lets run through the notes.
She shot me a smug, victorious look.
I looked down, pretending to read the script.
But I couldn't process a single word.
My phone vibrated in my pocket.
I sneakily pulled it out.
A text from Asher.
Babe, Im here. That Rowan girl is here too, of course. Annoying.
She tried to talk to me just now, but I totally ignored her.
You cant give people like that an inch. They just take advantage.
I was speechless.
Wait!
When did I try to talk to him?
He was the one who walked past me!
Did this man have two separate personalities?
High-and-mighty movie star in real life, petty, gossipy boyfriend in our texts?
I took a deep, steadying breath and replied: Mhm, you did the right thing.
Asher shot back instantly: I know, right? I have to keep my virtue safe. Besides you, I don't want anything to do with anyone else.
Reading that, my heart ached with a complicated mix of emotions.
If you ignored the reality, he was truly the perfect boyfriend.
But reality was staring me right in the face.
The director yelled into a megaphone: Places, everyone! Were going live! The first segment is drawing lots for teams!
My heart dropped.
Please, please, not with Asher Flynn.
Please, no.
But Murphys Law never fails.
When I pulled a red ball from the box, Asher was holding a red ball, too.
A dead silence fell over the stage.
The live comments were probably in a frenzy.
Sierras smile froze, quickly replaced by a pitying look directed at Asher. Asher, looks like you got the short straw.
Asher stared at the red ball in his hand, his brows tightly knitted.

So today I ordered 2 medium hazelnut truffle hot chocolates (no modifications) and it said it would be ready in 10 minutes. My local Dutch Bros is very slow so I got there in 15 minutes. When I walked up to the window there was another man placing an order for a large iced coffee of some kind. When he was done I told the barista my name and they said the order wasn't ready. They're always busy so I wasn't surprised and stood aside to wait. Five minutes later they called for the man that had ordered the iced coffee. It wasn't until 10 minutes later (half an hour after I ordered the drinks) that my name was called

My question is why didn't I get my drinks before the man? Considering at that point I had made the order 20 minutes prior whereas he only had to wait 5 minutes

The baristas are always very nice so I can't imagine this was malicious, but this was the 2nd time in a row that this happened (although last time instead of a man there was a woman with her dog getting a pupcup. And she hadn't shown up till 20 minutes after I had placed my order. Still got her stuff before me)",3,1766819275.0,dutchbros,1,1.0,False

Dry skin and just hungry all the time. Even if I was dehydrated and needed water, i wouldnt drink water and wait until I can get my hands on coffee or tea. It was that bad.

But I got a new job and had some extra money to burn so why not try the semi expensive water flavor thing I kept getting ads for every two seconds. So I went online and accidentally bought all the ""nasty"" ahh flavors lmao. The coffee ones the horchata one. You name it I bought it!

But the ones that are good. Theyre game changers. Since drinking cirkul my teeth aren't as yellow and stained from coffee/tea. (The kids i used to tutor asked me why I didnt brush my teeth like huh 😭) also ive lost bloating weight, my face is clearer, and my piss isnt dark yellow. 

I spend so much time attempting to be healthy. Sleeping 8 hours and eating mostly meat and vegetable, taking supplements, and exercising. But though these things helped. The key thing missing was my water intake. Cirkul changed my damn life no joke.

Shoutout to sabrocita strawberry the first one I ever tried and its soooooooo good!! I can drink this all day! I also love strawberry dream its so good! And okay ill admit the horchata one and coffee ones kinda grew on me. 

But whoever said strawberry banana was the best. A personal fuck you to you lmao 😭 that one had me convulsing and spasiming it was just too intense. Tasted like straight chemical and medication. That one deserves the most hate holy fuck. Id drink 5 gallons of horchata cirkul over a sip of strawberry banana. We should make the strawberry banana challenge be our version of the one chip challenge.

But anyways cirkul is the best! I like to joke and say that cirkul is like Russian roulette, but theres a bullet in every cylinder except for one 😭 gotta get shot a couple times before finding the one you like. And opinions vary. Some people like certain flavors that others despise. You gotta just try yourself and find what's good.

But yes I also love how easy it is to grab and go. I used to spend like 10 minutes a day making my ""healthy"" coffees and teas loaded with so much sugar free bs and creams and syrups. But Cirkul man, it changed my life. And I wish I didnt wait so long to click those damn ads. My life improved in a matter of weeks!

Thats all I gotta say! But I love honey crisp apple and sabrocita strawberry the most, so if anyone has any recommendations similar to those two id love to know!

1pwrh4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1pwrh4l/bangkok_example_itinerary/,Bangkok (example) Itinerary,"Hi everyone,

  
I'm going back to Bangkok with friends in January and have made a suggested itinerary based on my relatively limited experience in Bangkok - I've been four times but only for 1-2 weeks per trip.

  
I would really appreciate feedback/thoughts. This isn't meant as a 'let's do everything on here' rule book but rather a guide that we can pick bits from to inspire us on any given day. I think we would benefit most from insight on what's on here that should be avoided or any suggestions on experiences/sights that aren't currently on the guide.

  
Furthermore, if anyone has any recent experience using a fast-track service at BKK airport, I'd love to hear about it! Basically, is it worth paying 40 euro for?

Thanks in advance for any comments!

Just solo traveler looking to get a little grub and coffee.  Told to come back 2 hrs later and when I came back 15 mins shy of 2 hrs the girl working the desk was even more rude and abrasive saying they were at capacity and I needed to come back at yet even more at a later time.  Showed a slip with a time from my first try to enter to which she rudely said I need to come back at that time which was only 10 mins away.  Took a walk and came back to which I was again greeted rudely just to get some grub and cup of coffee.  I was out under 30 mins of occupying my lounge experience as my flight was finally boarding.

Background: My (33m) wife (33f) is a very social person, she somehow has the energy to see a friend for coffee in the morning before work and two more after work, I love that about her, but it’s not me.

Yesterday I noticed something was off, so I asked her what was bothering her. She said twice this week she came home around 7 pm and I was in bed watching a movie/ playing games. 

For me this is relaxing, we just had a week and a half straight of going out almost every night. Next week we are also starting another marathon so I needed some time to just chill.

However my wife got triggered and now fears that this is her future and it makes her think I’m  not motivated, don’t have ambition etc. 

I explained to her that I just need to relax sometimes and she seemed to accept it, but she said in the future if I go home and chill in bed after work to let her know so she can make plans with other friends so she doesn’t have to see it.

This seems unsustainable to me. Do I just accept it for the sake of the marriage or do I tell her that what I am doing is normal and she needs to live with it. Or something else?

FYI I have friends, I have a good job, I’m just not as social as her. 

TLDR: My wife is very social and gets anxious when she sees me relaxing alone in bed after work. She asked me to warn her in advance so she can make other plans. That feels unsustainable to me. Do I accept this for the sake of the marriage, or set a boundary that my downtime is normal and shouldn’t need managing?

I've been living alone for almost 2 years now. Umalis ako kasi ang draining lang talaga sa bahay and especially with my mom. I wfh kaya di ko rin kayang magwork nang maayos sa bahay kasi laging may drama/problem with her. I've also been getting therapy for 3 years because of her/my issues growing up.   
  
This year, tinry ko talaga ayusin yung perspective ko sa family ko, inisip ko na baka kaya pa namin magcreate ng good memories habang buhay pa yung parents ko...may mga kapatid rin ako na mas bata sakin and nasa bahay pa. So di ko sila nakakasama madalas since once a month lang din ako umuuwi. Pag umuuwi ako, tinatry ko naman i-treat sila sa labas or kahit movie/coffee date lang ganon. And nung start ng 2025 tinry ko din tawagan yung mom ko more often, and akala ko talaga on a good path na kami.   
  
Pero during the last couple of months, ang daming nangyari sa bahay (involving my mom ulit) and grabe talaga yung strain sakin emotionally/mentally. As in sobrang nalungkot ako kasi feeling ko malapit na ako mag give up sa idea na magiging healthy/happy yung family namin...specifically my relationship with my mom.

1pwr7a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Step2/comments/1pwr7a9/step_2_exam_day_experience_scored_272/,Step 2 exam day experience( scored 272),"I got my results recently and wanted to make a post about my exam-day experience and how I prepared for D-day.

So the prep began 1 week before the exam, starting with changing my sleep schedule to comfortably get up without feeling tired. I had taken my last exam (Free 120) 5 days before so that I wouldn’t carry over the feeling of tanking the test if it didn’t go well. In the last few days, I just revised the notes I made and watched some Randy Neil biostats and ethics on YouTube. I had decided not to study anything on the last day but actually stopped studying 2 days before to keep my nerves calm.

The night before the exam, I prepared myself to get into a sleep-friendly mindset by following some advice (credits: Reddit), and it really helped. I took a hot shower, drank some hot milk, switched off all the lights in the room by 8 pm, watched some random series for some time, and went to bed by 10:30 pm. (Very different from Step 1, where I didn’t do any of this — the whole night was extremely anxious and I slept very little.)

**D-Day (Exam day)**  
Woke up around 6 am and reached the centre by 7 am. As I was early, my test started early at 7:45.

**Pro tip:** When entering your ID into the computer, copy the ID by pressing CTRL+C and paste with CTRL+P. (Saves a few seconds instead of entering the ID every time.)

**The experience**  
Honestly, the exam went by in a blur. It started out a little slow in the first block as I was still getting used to it, and there was a lot of disturbance in the beginning since people around were still walking in to get to their places and stuff.

The noise-cancelling headphones they provide are pretty bad. I used my own earplugs, which blocked out noise sufficiently.

So my plan for taking breaks was something like this:  
2 blocks – break (10 mins)  
2 blocks – break (10 mins)  
1 block – break (20 mins, ate my lunch)  
1 block – break (10 mins)  
1 block – break (10 mins)  
Last block

**Tip:** Go inside the room 2 minutes before your actual timed plan, because time outside passes by very fast and you might miss the cutoff.

I made this plan because I knew the latter blocks would need more time to recuperate, as I would be completely drained. The reality was no different — the last blocks were honestly very hard to get through. It felt as though I became numb and was running on autopilot (I wasn’t able to think as clearly as before).

During each break, I ate something to keep myself energised. Things I took to eat were eggs, some blueberries, and kiwi. For drinking, I took some coffee and mango juice. In the last blocks, mango juice was very helpful in giving me the energy to push through.

The exam itself was not completely bad. Yes, it was daunting to sit for 9 hours, but I felt most of the exam was within what was to be expected, and very few questions were like, “Why would they ask this kind of question?”

My advice is to mentally prepare yourself for long questions and the format of questions being asked, because they ask everything — from charts to sequence questions to drug ads.

4:30PM



When I took the dispatcher position back in my hometown, I didn’t think I would have to deal with the kinds of things I’ve had to deal with today. It is now 4:30 PM Christmas Day as I write this. I’m hoping that I can get this posted before the end of the day so I can warn as many people as possible. You don’t want to be caught unaware of what’s going on right now. 

I am assuming that this is going on everywhere, but I don’t know that for sure right now. Although I am certain that you will agree with my assumption once you have read to the end of this post. Also, please forgive me if I ramble. I am very frantically typing this at the moment, and I may occasionally tangent to relieve stress. I don’t really have time to edit this, and it is a necessary coping mechanism, so deal with it. Please.

For context, I live in a small midwestern town; corn, soy, and grain country. I had just finished college and was experiencing some heavy burnout. I took the job back home, I think, because I needed some newfound sense of direction. Up until that point, I had been following a path laid out for me, not that I hadn’t made my own decisions, but I was making those choices with the eye of others in mind. I didn’t care about that anymore. Local dispatch for my hometown was the first opportunity where I thought I would be helpful, as in helping people, not somebody’s profit margin.

The only problem is I hate cops. I don’t know for certain what the origin of calling them pigs is, but I like to think it has to do with them basically being the state’s clean-up crew. In the sense that pigs served as the mob’s clean-up crew. I ended up taking the job because I knew a few of the cops from when I was a kid, and the sergeant in charge helped me out one time. I thought I could do some good with these personal connections. But now, I don’t know what any single person can do about anything anymore.

My family wasn’t around, so I decided to work Christmas Day at the station. Earlier in the month, it had snowed a ton, but now there was nothing but a thick layer of mist that made everything it touched wet. I hate 100% humidity. It makes my whole body sticky and uncomfortable. Regardless, I was inside quickly enough that it didn’t bother me too much. The sergeant, I’ll call him Bill, and his deputy, Greg, were the only two cops on call that day.

“Well, hey there, Nate, I hope you slept well?” Bill spoke with a deep baritone from under a bristly white mustache. 

“Yeah,” I said, evading the question. I began setting up my desk the way I liked it. I had my police mojo computer on my right and my own personal laptop on my left, which I was planning to watch Queen’s Gambit on.

“Good to hear it. Well, I’ll let you get to it. Me and Greg are gonna go get some coffee. So give us a call if anything explodes.” 

I smiled at him. “Will do.” He gave me a nod and walked away. I felt the rumble of their cruiser as it started. 

During this time, I was the only dispatcher on duty for my area, which was large, but didn’t even have one person per square mile on average. So, I was the lonely watchmen. A skeleton crew was normal, as this day was usually pretty uneventful out here, but I was worried about the fog and car accidents. I decided to raid the break room for snacks. On my way back, I passed by the front door for what would’ve been the second time. I was some distance from it down the hall, but as it perceived me, I felt a shiver run through my whole body. A huge deer, shrouded in fog from the bottom of the neck down, was staring through the clear glass of the front door. Staring at me as I held my bags of chips, cookies, and shit. It didn’t move, but its empty black eyes followed me as I receded towards my little office. I threw everything on my desk, then peeked back down the hall. It was gone.

“What the fuck,” I spat it out as if just then realising what happened. It didn’t look alive, closer to a taxidermied trophy.  

Any thinking I could’ve done was interrupted by a 911 call. I quickly sat at my desk, took a deep breath, and picked it up. “911, what’s your emergency?”

“It’s Earl!” I recognized the voice on the other end.

“Margaret? It’s Nate. Is Earl having another heart attack?” As I spoke, I entered her address and held the mouse over the button that would dispatch an ambulance. 

“Oh, Nate! Yes, he’s… he’s.  OH MY GOD!” I dispatched the ambulance, emphasizing emergency.

“Margaret? Are you okay?”

“He’s dead, he’s dead.”

“It’s okay, Mrs. Adler. The ambulance is already on its way, they’re gonna help him.”

“No, I…I felt his pulse go.” She started crying. 

I radioed Bill, muting the call. “Bill, I just sent an ambulance to the Adler residence. It’s not looking good, so you might want to head over.”

“Roger that.”

I heard Margaret wheezing and moving quickly, then the slam of a door, followed by more crying. “I can’t believe he’s dead. Oh my god, he’s dead.”

“Margaret, Bill’s gonna be there soon, okay?”

“Okay,” she said. Then an almost thunderous knocking.

“Margaret? Is everything okay?” 

I looked over at the GPS map. Bill was eight minutes away. The ambulance was four minutes away. Margaret gave nothing in reply other than a short intake of breath. I heard a doorknob twist and creak. Then a frantic movement and a click. She locked it.

“Margaret, was anyone else in the house with you?”

“No,” she whispered. “I had my finger on his pulse the whole time. That is not my husband.”

“Margaret? Why’d you lock me out?” It sounded like him. I have since googled Lazarus Sydrome but at the time, I assumed this was impossible, which it might as well have been. Regardless, the real thing that scared me was that Margaret didn’t trust it. In this situation, she should be in denial of his death, not of his life. 

“Don’t open the door,” I said. “The ambulance is three minutes away.”

“Margaret! Please! I’ve been to the other side, I can tell you! I can tell! I can tell! I can tell you! Margaret!” I heard a loud bang against the door. “That’s okay. You’ll find out soon enough anyways.” I heard muffled receding footsteps. Time passed in silence. I heard a more distant knock after the paramedics arrived. Then she hung up. I sat there for a moment. I don’t know how long. Another call came in. I answered.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Um… my-my name is Eddy.” The voice sounded like a young boy’s

“Okay, Eddy, what’s going on?”

“Um…a car hit us. Really hard.”

“Do you know where you are?”

“No, it hit on my mom’s side. She’s not moving.” I heard him start to cry.

“Is the driver of the other car still there?”

“He flew.”

“What do you mean?”

“He wasn’t wearing a seatbelt. He hit our car too.” 

I almost said “fuck me” out loud. This was not at all the stress level I was anticipating for the day.

“Who’s on the phone!?” I heard a man’s voice yell.

“Is that him?” He sounded fine. Then I remembered the last call.

“Yeah.”

“Eddy?” I heard a much sweeter voice.

“You stupid fucking bitch!” I heard screaming.

“Eddy, run down the street until you find a street sign okay?” I heard no response. “Eddy?” somebody hung up. “FUCK!!” I yelled. I was beginning to panic. I felt my chest tighten, and I began to cry as I spiraled down thoughts of uselessness. “What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?” I repeated to myself over and over again. Then I wrote this. I’ll let you know if anything else happens out here.



Thank you for reading

7 PM

Bill and Greg returned to the station sometime after that and found me in my office with my head in my arms.

“You okay there, Nate?” I looked up into his eyes. He looked tired. 

“Yeah, what happened to Margaret?” He sighed and thought for a moment. Instead of responding, he waved his arm and walked away. I rolled myself and my chair into the hall. “What do we do now?” I asked. The phone rang, and I went back into the office. Bill started walking back towards me. I picked up.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“I’m at Skeeter’s Pub, and there’s a guy with a gun.”

“Okay, is he threatening people with it?”

“Not yet, but him and this guy keep getting at it with each other. They’ve been here since before I got here, so I think they’re both drunk.”

“Alright, a coupleof  officers are on the way.” 

I muted myself as she said, “Thank you.”

“Armed drunkard at Skeeter’s pub” I looked at Bill. I’d never seen him scared like that before.

“Goddamnit, Greg, let’s go. Stay on the phone and keep us updated, Nate!” They left. 

“Ma’am can you get yourself out of the pub?”

“Not without moving past them, I’d rather just stay here.”

“Fuck you!” I heard from a distance. Then a loud pop followed by lots of screaming.

“Oh my god, he shot him,” she was whispering now. “No wait, did he miss?”

“No way,” I heard another voice. “I saw it go straight through his head.”

“What the fuck? He’s getting back up.”

“The man who was shot?” I asked.

“Yeah, he got shot in the head and just got back up. The other guys doesn’t know what to do.” I heard several more gunshots. 

“AHHHH!” A scream followed by a repetitive banging.

“Holy shit, he’s just smashing his face on the bar.”

“FREEZE!” I heard Bill yell. Something wet slid and then dropped onto the floor.

“I think the other guy is dead.” A wet gurgle and a fit of coughing followed. “Uh…I uh…”

“What’s happening?”

“He… got back up. What the fuck!? He got back up like it was nothing!?”

Pandemonium and several more gunshots followed before I lost connection. 

Am I anything but an observer?

Do I have the power to change things?

My shift ends soon

I guess I’ll go home



**Part 2**



Hello everyone, I'm still hunkered down at home. I went back to the station to check on Bill and the guys and they gave me a copy of the police report. They're technically not supposed to do that, but who gives a fuck at this point?

Regardless, here is the report. I changed names, phone numbers, and such, but most of it was left as is. Just so you know, this report is wack. Read at your own discretion. 

[https://imgur.com/a/o2zSEmE](https://imgur.com/a/o2zSEmE)

I might go see Msg. McIntyre. I haven't been to church in a long time, and I'm starting to think this is some apocalypse shit. The more I think about what's happening with just this information, the more I scare myself with the potential implications. Even if the event is localised.

But that's not what has me scared at this very moment.

I had a dream last night. I'll try to remember it as best I can, which, as I’m writing this, turns out to be surprisingly easy.

I woke up and used the bathroom. I was already dreaming at this point, but I didn't know that. When I finished in the bathroom, the warm sun was out. It made me want to have a productive day, so I went to the kitchen and prepared myself a high-protein breakfast.

""Sleep well, honey?"" she asked.

""Yeah, pretty good.""

""What's the plan for the day?"" he asked.

""Hopefully something productive."" I turned around to serve a plate of sausage and eggs, but all I saw was two taxidermied deer sitting at the dinner table. Their legs and arms were malformed so that they sat like humans. I served both of them plates anyway. They didn't eat.

""You okay there, bud?"" he asked. Mouth unmoving.

""Yeah, I just."" My eyes began to sting, and tears formed. ""I just... don't know what's happening."" I put my head in my hands.

""Ohh, that's okay, honey."" I didn't hear her move, but I felt warmer, like she was close to me. ""No one does.""

“It’s too much mom. It’s all too much.”

“I know, honey. It’s okay. Everything will be okay.”

I looked up to see an empty dinner table, except for one occupant at the head to my right. I knew who it was immediately. His head bloomed like a flower, and he took forceful, wet breaths through broken airways. Sputtering blood with each motion, he shook as if in a great deal of pain.

""Ray?""

I woke up. My bed was drenched in sweat. I've been trying to stay calm the whole day. I really miss them. I was breaking down, basically rolling around the floor like I was on fire, until Bear lay on top of me. I'm going to the morning service tomorrow. At the very least, I'll meet people who might know more than me. The fog still blankets everything I can see, maybe a foot away from all the windows. I keep imagining the dark shapes of deer at the border.

I recently made a post about casual weekend hangouts and got a few DMs already. Posting again to see if a few more people are interested so we can actually form a small group.

The idea is simple:

Chill weekend meetups

Coffee / food / walks / football / random plans

No pressure, no weird vibes just normal people hanging out

If you’re:

New to the city
Bored of staying in every weekend
Or just want to meet a few like-minded folks

DM me. Once we hit around 10 people, I’ll make a group and we’ll take it from there.
Keeping it small initially to see how it goes and if it clicks, we can always bring more people in. Who knows, if it turns out good, maybe even a summer trip in April. If you are in click on the link below to join the group.

1pwr46k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pwr46k/aitah_if_i_cut_off_my_sister/,AITAH if I cut off my sister?,"My sister (26F) and I (24F) are adults now, however we have bickered and fought for as long as we’ve been alive. I know as time goes on and the more we bicker she has more basis or more of a past with me to her angry over. But it has really always been this way. 

I had a lot of physical and mental health problems as a kid, often in severe pain or discomfort of some sort, and very emotional because I couldn’t understand what was happening to little me. (OCD, cptsd, endo, etc) we both got different kinds of attention but I never thought one more than the other. Just had different needs. But as we get older I realize she gets (and always has gotten) angry at me over really small things that don’t affect her whatsoever. 

Just to give an example, the other day (on vacation) I had a really bad endo flare up, I was in so much pain I was crying. It was after dinner, around 8 pm so I said lemme lay down for a second and chill before getting ready for bed and brushing my teeth etc. I even told her I’m so sorry I’m crying just gimme a sec and I’ll be good!! She immediately starts to question me like “ew you’re not gonna brush your teeth?!” I was so hormonal and emotional and in pain I lashed out at her. I can’t stand the antagonizing questions, and I know she does it because it works and frustrates me. We started yelling at each other. 

It is constantly like this, all the fucking time. She gets upset at what I wear, anything I do, or things I say that aren’t inflammatory whatsoever. I genuinely feel like I can’t do the right thing. Even my parents (who are often similar unfortunately) say she is aggressive towards me, but that I also struggle to control my emotions and I let it get to me. Which is true. But I think once your buttons get pushed so many times you can only take so much. I get called crazy when I get upset at how I’m treated, and told to go with the flow, but again they get upset at me when I do. I know I am not perfect and I often do complain about my pain for example, which I know is annoying. I think I do it because I want them to care. Like, another example here, but today she had a headache and my mom was giving her kisses and hugs, whereas I had never gotten that while I was in any pain. I used to beg for hugs and comfort as a child and I refuse to do it now. 

Again I know all my health problems were not easy for my family, and that they do financially support me in terms of medical stuff and taking us on vacation and such. I’m so grateful for all they do for me and I always tell them but I still feel I don’t deserve to be treated this way. I revert back to my child self with them, and my temper is so unlike me. I’m normally such a calm person and I’m so sad to see myself act in a way that is uncomfortable for me and others. I’m not sure any amount of rationalizing or therapy or willpower is gonna fix our problems with each other, and I’m starting to accept we will never truly be sisters, as I’ve never felt like I had an older sister to trust or talk to or rely on. She’s just there, and so am I. We have no bond except over how fucked our family is towards each other and that we all need therapy. But nobody wants to change. 

When I had lashed out, my dad had a conversation with me hours later about how I need to let things be and laugh at the situation and to change my behavior but I do care and I don’t think it’s fair that I’ve worked so hard through years of therapy to change and to understand why things are the way they are. Why do I have to change but nobody else does? Why am I the only one here who’s a problem? Again I know I am not a perfect person and I have been an annoying daughter in the past but I can’t help but feel like, am I really so horrible that I deserve to be treated like this? I started developing ocd obsessions about whether or not I am a good person over very very small things or incidents, even as a small as just spilling my coffee. I believe my family thinks I want to be a victim and that I choose to be one, and I know it’s a choice to react but I didn’t choose to be antagonized and belittled and yelled at over minute things 🥲 

today my sister and I were fine, I really did my best to be calm, and even had a couple good moments with her, until the end of day. It’s our last day on vacation (again so grateful) and we just got back from dinner, I had a tiny bit too much to drink and I normally don’t drink much at all. She asked in that tone, “you’re not gonna pack? Can you pack?” I told her could I just have 10-15 min cause I’m drunk, and she got so upset. She goes upstairs to tell my parents how I’m so selfish etc etc and my parents took her side. It’s so stupid and I might’ve been wrong for asking for 10 min but it was only 9 pm 🥲 after that lights are out and she’s up and on the phone for an hour. I was livid, her acting like she is so tired and needs to sleep just to not even attempt to sleep had me raging. 

I decided that for both mine and her sake maybe it’s best to distance ourselves. I went outside to watch the stars, and sent her a text that it might be best to distance ourselves and that I wouldn’t be seeing her or speaking to her in the upcoming year. It feels so horrible to say that but after my mom expressed disappointment in both of us for not getting along, I thought this would be the best choice. I doubt I went about it the right way, but I told her I’d be chill the way back home and then we should distance ourselves. Feeling so guilty but I can’t let myself go through this over and over and over again. AITAH?? 🥲",1,1766817691.0,AITAH,1,0.67,False

when did you notice that your food noise was gone ? did you feel it coming back when you reduced your dosage ? if so, what did you do about it ?

my food noise is still here (less than pre-wegovy though) and it's hard to distract myself

\- do you exercise ? if so, what do you do ?

i find it hard to walk as i get tired really fast and my knees hurt from a previous injury (basketball....ugh....) so i bought an exercise bike that i can use while sitting but i want to do more, i just don't know what i can do, any idea is very welcomed

\- cravings ? did they come back ?

i'm still craving snacks in between meals (even if i try my hardest to not indulge in them, i just drink water/coffee instead, don't know if that's okay?)

\- did you stop once you reach your WG or did you switch to something else to maintain it ?

Another suggestion I have is to separate swipe up action for widgets/docks from the rest of the Homescreen. During my nova time, I used to set swipe up from homescreen to show recent app and swipe up from dock to open the app drawer. That would be extremely useful!

1pwqry9,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1pwqry9/jura_e8_or_giga_10/,Jura E8 or Giga 10?,"Here's my current setup.  I live alone and have a **Ninja dual brew** (it does beans and K-cups), a **Baratza grinder** to grind the coffee for it and a **Phillips Latego 3200**.  For work I'll use the 26oz setting on the Ninja to fill a travel mug and it makes enough to drink a separate cup with breakfast.  At night I'll make a decaf K-cup with it.

If I'm off, I'll either make a 16oz single cup of regular coffee with the Ninja if I have some fancier coffee that I don't want to use for work.  Or, I'll use the ""coffee"" setting on the Phillips superauto to make a 2 cups which comes out to about 16oz and is great for sitting at my computer.  I don't really like the taste of the Americano on the Phillips, possibly because it sends the water through the coffee?

So I'm considering a Jura E8 (already ordered one actually, but it hasn't shipped yet) or a Giga 10 as a friend has one and was saying how great it is.  If I go with the E8 I'll replace the Phillips super auto with it and go on with my current coffee making habits (Ninja for work coffee, decaf K-cup in the evening, Jura E8 for day home drinks, etc).  Or, if I got a Giga10 I could perhaps get rid of the Ninja and the grinder and use the dual hoppers for regular and decaf, morning, evening and maybe some half cafs at times.  I'm 'ok' with the cost of either, but the Giga 10 is obviously a bunch more money at twice the price ($5,500 vs $2,800) and I do have to work extra to talk myself into spending $5,500 on a coffee machine.

*So, questions...*

How is maintenance on the Juras?  I've read that you have to change the filters pretty often?  I can go for a long time on the Ninja and Philips before needing to change them.  If I had just the Giga10 for everything I might be changing a lot more often than if I was just making home coffee with an E8.

I recognize that the Giga10 isn't designed as a drip coffee maker equivalent to make a pot of coffee, but any thoughts on how well the Giga 10 would work to replace my grinder and Ninja dual brew to be a 1 machine solution?  My research (AI) says that the Giga10 will have to make 6 shots on the coffee setting to get to the 26oz equivalent of the Ninja, using about twice the amount of beans compared to the 3 large scoops I use with the Ninja

How do you tell how much water is in the Giga10?  As you can see, my current 2 have clear water containers where as the Jura doesn't so its not an easy glance to see how much is in there.  It seems like a hassle if I have to take the water container out of the Giga to see how full it is.

The more I type all of the above, as much as I want to get the Giga10, the more the E8 makes sense from a practical sense for my home and work needs of making larger volumes with the Ninja and decaf k-cups at night.

Thoughts?

The idea is simple:

Chill weekend meetups
Coffee / food / walks / sports / random plans
No pressure, no weird vibes just normal people hanging out

If you’re:

New to the city
Bored of staying in every weekend
Or just want to meet a few like-minded folks

DM me. Once we hit around 10 people, I’ll make a group and we’ll take it from there.

Keeping it small initially to see how it goes and if it clicks, we can always bring more people in. Who knows, if it turns out good, maybe even a summer trip in April. If you are in click on the link to join
