Morning light filtered into golden bars by shades shut tight filled a warm, comfortable bedroom. The only sound was that of soft breathing, slow and steady. A soft alarm split the air, quickly silenced with a smooth hand as Jane awoke. Yawning, she sat up and stretched, rubbing sleep from sky blue eyes. Glancing to the other side of the bed, she let a warm smile spread over her face, mountains of love swelling in her chest. Even though he would have left for work hours ago, she swore a little bit of his scent lingered in the air, a little bit of warmth where he slept. Kissing the tips of two fingers, she ran them down his pillow and whispered, “Good morning Mark.” Before getting ready for the day.

One burning hot shower later and after assembling her honey-colored hair into a messy bun, Jane sat at their dining room table, coffee in hand. While waiting for it to cool she let the luxurious scent waft over her and gazed with pride around their small home. As she had every day for the past few months, Jane marveled at what she and Mark had created together. Wooden floors worked in tandem with walls covered by caramel-colored tiles to give the space a comfortable, earthen feel. There were only truly three rooms; their bedroom, bathroom, and the large open space that served as a kitchen, living room, and dining room all at once. Slim rectangular windows were carefully spaced out to provide humble illumination as the sun set and rose, her favorite being the skylight set above their living room. Within this light, Jane had placed flowers and ferns in small ceramic pots so the house would smell like spring year-round.

Austere, but comfortable. Just how she and Mark liked it.

Her favorite part by far was the section of wall right by their front door. As a surprise to celebrate their move-in, Mark had gathered seemingly every photo of them ever taken and framed them all, turning an ordinary wall into a collage of their relationship. He had even made it symmetrical, with the photo of their wedding kiss serving as the centerpiece of it all. Underneath this collage was a small maple shelf that held trinkets and treasures, their only value the memories attached to them. A violet geode lay next to an interesting stick that Mark had *refused* to throw away, both tokens of a beautiful hike. The clipped movie tickets of their first date, the worn and ragged paintbrushes they had used on this very house, and the most recent addition, their engagement rings tied together with red string.

It was that kind of devotion and attention to detail that fueled her unending love for him. And now he was…

Jane set her cup down, the liquid inside shaking violently.

‘*Cleaning time!’* She thought and got to work. The floors were swept, their laundry folded, counters wiped, and dishes cleaned.

‘*Aw, he washed his dishes before heading out.’* Jane thought, for there was only one plate and fork in the sink.

As she went about the never-ending chores that came with owning a house, she began to softly hum a song. Her and Mark’s favorite…

She stopped. For only a moment, a second. ‘*He’s…’* her mind thought before she wrested back control and carried on, humming her mom’s favorite tune.

It was not until the sun began streaming through the kitchen window, illuminating golden flecks of dust in the air, that Jane realized how late it had gotten. Time had ceased to matter while she worked, hands occupied with cleaning and mind occupied with not thinking about…

She shook her head. Mark would be home soon, and dinner wasn’t even ready yet! With a flick of the dial the stove began to heat up, red-top glowing a merry cherry red. ‘*Stew sounds perfect. His favorite.’* She thought to herself, gently smiling. As she pulled down ingredients and spices to begin, her thoughts flew to the memory of the stew he had created for her during a particularly nasty winter cold. The thought of that over-salted, under-cooked, but lovingly handcrafted meal drew out a small chuckle. He had made it to try and make her feel better, and the look on his face was so genuine and worried she had eaten every bite (though she politely declined a second bowl). Her smile grew strained, then drooped. ‘*I’ll never get to…’*

She pushed her pinky finger against the heating stovetop, just for a moment. Only long enough for the burn to wash away her thoughts with the most basic of needs, avoiding pain. “Oh Jane, you gotta be more careful!” she said to herself, cheery voice bouncing dismally through the empty house. After applying some fresh aloe to the burn, the rest of dinner was assembled without issue. She had just set it to simmer on low heat when the sound she looked forward to every day bloomed behind her.

Keys jingled in their oaken door, heralds of her love’s return. As it swung open and shut on silent hinges, Jane swore a little bit of life, of warmth, emanated forth.

Smiling, she said without turning around, “Hello hun! How was work today? Dinner shouldn’t be long; this just needs to simmer for another twenty or so.”

Silence was the only reply, a complete stillness broken only by the faint bubbling of her stew.

“Mark?” she asked, turning around, brow furrowed in a mixture of confusion and concern.

The house was empty. The house was quiet. The only sign of life was the beating of her heart, which began to accelerate, a familiar weight settling on her chest. She felt her mind begin to crack; a dozen different ‘hers’ clamoring to be heard. Leaning back against the kitchen counter in an attempt to still her shaking hands and take weight off of her weakening legs, she let the kindest voice speak up.

‘*He’s just running a little late’* It whispered. ‘*He’ll be here any moment now’*

Taking deep breaths, Jane used that voice to blot out all else, and for that scant thirty seconds it felt like she would be alright. Then she looked straight ahead, and stared into the collage’s centerpiece, gaze affixed on the image of her and Mark’s kiss.

And her thoughts shattered like brittle glass.

The kind voice vanished amidst a cacophony of repressed thoughts, each an equal piece of her, and yet each distinct from her own voice.

‘*He’s gone, he’s gone’*

*‘You’re alone, broken, FOREVER’*

*‘You could’ve saved him, could’ve stopped him’*

*‘But you didn’t, you failed him’*

*‘He was perfection incarnate and now he’s GONE’*

*‘You didn’t tell him you loved him enough’*

*‘Didn’t make it clear how much you needed him’*

*‘How much better he made your life’*

*‘How you really felt all the time’*

*‘Why would you, if he knew what you really are…’*

*‘A coward’*

*‘A weakling’*

*‘Worthless, useless’*

*‘…then he would have left you long ago’*

*‘Which means YOU’RE responsible for this’*

*‘YOU’RE why he’s dead’*

*‘If you had found the courage to push him away…’*

*‘Which you KNEW you needed to do’*

*‘…he wouldn’t have been there that day’*

*‘That accident would have taken someone else, ANYONE else’*

*‘But you had to be lazy’*

*‘You had to let him go to the store for you’*

*‘If you had just gotten up and driven yourself’*

*‘It could have taken YOU instead’*

*‘And he would still be alive, with someone who DESERVES him, who DESERVES to be happy’*

*‘You tore the most precious man possible out of this world’*

*‘You deserve this, you deserve to be alone’*

The weight in her chest was all-encompassing, driving her to the floor. Her back against the cupboards they had painted together, sitting on the wooden tiles they had spent hours deciding on.

Streams of tears flowed down her face as she whispered to herself, “No no no no no no no no no no no no no no…” over and over like a prayer. She could barely breathe, the tightness around her heart no more substantial than a dream, yet it crushed her with its weight all the same.

Within her mind numbed by grief, by guilt, by sorrow and anger, far beneath her voices still screaming their truths, she felt something stir. In the depths of her subconscious, a voice that was of her more than any else, lazily opened an eye and spoke in a smooth, commanding tone.

‘***You… wanted this…’*** SHE said. ‘***You wanted… to break…’***

The other voices did not fall quiet, or relent in their unending tirade, but the all-consuming truth SHE spoke shrouded her mind in a veil of emotional paralysis. Her body froze, hands and chest shaking of their own accord.

SHE spoke again. Not in a tone of accusation or malice, but in one of simple, confident truth. ‘***You wanted to break… as is only natural… What else could you do…? You… are tired… Surrender yourself to the darkness… let me clothe you in the blanket of grief… Resist not the voices of truth within you… for in their venom there is release…’***

Jane could only sit there, frozen on the floor. SHE was right, she could feel that blankness, that void which promised release. Release in helplessness, release in sorrow and guilt, release in letting voices blot out her mind.

And yet, a small, infinitesimal part of her still clung desperately to hope, any hope, wishing fervently for a savior, for a shoulder to cry on.

SHE seemed bemused. ‘***You have lost your shoulder… Jane… You are alone… But you can still have your savior… your release… Look up…’*** SHE commanded. Jane obeyed and looked across the collection Mark had lovingly created for her.

‘***Gaze upon what you once had… and what you have lost…’*** SHE said.

Once more Jane obeyed, and each frame held another dagger that plunged into her soul. Each memory a dry log thrown upon the pyre of her despair.

Their first date, after she had finally worked up the courage to ask him out.

The picture his father had snapped at his house of their first kiss, followed by another of their mortified expressions as they turned towards the camera flash.

Him holding her on his shoulders as they fought in a chicken-fight against his brother and sister, surrounded by crystal waves.

The twin bouquets he had assembled and placed on her parent’s graves, turning a painful memory into one of compassion and understanding.

His look of astonishment as she surprised him at work with a birthday cake, the whole office having a good-natured laugh at his expression.

And… most beautiful and painful of all, the crown-jewel that was their wedding. She had never tired of looking upon it, reliving the joy and love that they had for each other.

One by one the voices softly slipped into a unified truth. Their words not heard but felt, like a vibration upon her soul.

‘*Gone. Gone. He’s gone, forever. And you are alone. Truly, truly alone.’*

Tears that had frozen with her shock now flowed freely; an ocean of love converted into a sea of grief that poured out of the empty space that was her soul.

SHE encompassed her, wrapping her mind in the promised shroud of overwhelming emotion. Drowning out all that she was. SHE did not lie, could not lie, and in the warmth of oblivion she let herself fade. Not a living death, but very, very close. Time became irrelevant, her body and hunger unimportant. Nothing mattered in the face of her despair. She was only vaguely aware of the rivers pouring from her eyes, the aches and pains of a body sat in one position for too long. That was not her, for she was nothing. And in that haze, she wondered why she had ever tried to convince herself that she was something to begin with.

She knew that this could not last forever, that eventually she would need to return to herself, to give up the comforting shield of emotion and return to reality, and this only made her despair stronger. Yet deep within her mind, that knowledge also fueled the tiny spark of hope. Hope that things could change, that she could heal. It was not a powerful source, she didn’t even notice its presence, but it was resolute all the same.

SHE knew this, and as such did not try to smother the hope but twisted it. Warped it. Not out of malice or hate, but because that is what SHE does. Once complete, that hope floated to the surface of her mind, accompanied by the voice of SHE.

‘***We both know that oblivion cannot last forever… That pain and suffering will return… You… are alone Jane… and you will always feel this way… I am a part of you… and therefore weak… but there is an escape… A way to see him again… to flee these agonies… for we cannot withstand them any longer…’***

No more was said, and no more was required. Jane’s mind flicked to the block of knives above her, only to be pulled back down by the primal sense of self-preservation.

SHE directed her thoughts, suffusing her, becoming as one. ‘***Why not… what do I have left… I could… I could see him again… Stop feeling like this… If I wasn’t such a coward… You have to focus… and face the facts… You are broken beyond repair… alone and forgotten… There is no other way… Your mind died the same day he did…’***

She rose to her feet like a puppet, flesh moving on its own. The world, the house, her, had all gained a surreal quality. Everything was set to grey, rendered inert. Like an outside observer she watched her body turn to face the counter.

‘*Oh, the stew will burn.’* She thought, the small flare of mirth at the ridiculousness of her concern quickly extinguished by the gales of apathy. Selecting a knife, the SHE that was her thought, ‘***Your soul died with his… it is time for the body to follow…’***

The blade rasped like a serpent’s hiss as she began to pull it-

*Ding!*

The doorbell rang, it’s pure note reverberating through Jane like a thunderclap. Shock and panic flushed her mind as the knife dropped back into its wooden sheath. Another *Ding!* Rang out as she set hands flat against the countertop, breathing heavy as reality returned. She dabbed her puffy eyes with a rag and took a few shaky breaths before walking over and opening the door.

Mark’s sister Amber stood on the doorstep, finger over the doorbell and box of tea in hand. Makeup lines streaked from her eyes, betraying tears to rival Jane’s own, and an air of grief and desperation clung to her like a shroud.

As Amber offered a weak smile, Jane was struck by an agonizing sense of familiarity. The same dark hair, green eyes, and nervous smile. It was almost too much to bear. A voice, coarse with emotion but still soft and kind cut through her thoughts.

“I, was having a rough day today.” Amber said. “I thought, maybe you could use some company? I- I know I could.”

She proffered the box of tea with a hand that shook only slightly. “Mark’s favorite. I thought we could enjoy a cup and, I don’t know, just not be alone for a little bit?”

She looked at Jane with a worried, confused expression, and with a start Jane realized she had just stood there motionless the whole time. A look of worry spread across her face as she tried to think of a response, mind locked in a desperate tug-of-war between oblivion and the slightest hope of recovery.

After several seconds of strained silence, Amber nodded once and bit her lip. “Right.” She said, “I’m sorry, I bet you want to be alone. I’ll just-“

“No.” Jane said, lips moving on their own.

Everyone; the voices, SHE, Amber, and even Jane herself were taken aback. Before the mental war could resume Jane hurriedly said, “I mean, no, don’t leave. I have s-some, stew cooking that we could, eat together?”

That spark within her, feeble and small, swelled with the smile of relief that Amber gave. “That sounds, wonderful.” She said.

As they entered the kitchen Amber took the kettle from its hook on the wall and began filling it with water. Without turning around she said, “Here, let me get this going. You should sit, rest a little bit.”

Her words fell on deaf ears as Jane stood in shock looking at her back, a completely unexpected visitor. The voices and SHE swirled anew in her mind, but that flame within her had grown, and now warmed her soul.

‘*I’m, not alone’.* She marveled.

The voices discordant chatter swelled in response.

‘*She’s just using you to feel better herself’*

*‘She’ll leave you like everyone else did’*

*‘You’ll fail her just like you failed him’*

*‘I am not alone.’* She thought.

*How can she help you if she’s broken too’*

*‘You’re beyond repair, she’ll see that’*

*‘You’re just dragging her down with you’*

*‘I am not alone.’* She thought.

‘*She doesn’t actually need you, no one does’*

*‘She’ll abandon you the second she can’*

*‘I am not alone!’* She thought.

Beneath it all the voice of SHE whispered, not defeated, simply repressed. ‘***I will… always be here for you… Jane… When she leaves… When you break again… When you need me… My oblivion will always be waiting for you… with open… arms…’***

*I know.* Jane thought, centering her mind around that fire of hope, and the truth that she was not alone. Piece by piece, the broken parts of her mind gathered around that core. They still whispered to her, the cracks and pain lingered still, and SHE eternally slumbered beneath it all, but she no longer felt so broken.

Amber turned with two cups of tea and furrowed her brow, “Are you okay?” she asked.

Jane began to give the automatic response of “Yes” but stopped. It wasn’t quite true. She glanced at the picture of her wedding, letting the emotions stored within wash over her. Let the memories of Mark wash over her.

Turning back to Amber, still standing there looking concerned, Jane gave a smile. It was a small, weak smile, but a smile all the same.

“I will be.” She said, and she meant it. Because it’s what Mark would have wanted.

I’m not sure how to process this, and I feel deeply hurt.

In the early years of our marriage, I wasn’t a good husband. I never cheated or physically hurt her, but I neglected her emotionally, especially after our first child was born. I focused all my attention on being the ""fun dad"" or on work, leaving her feeling unimportant. This behavior stopped about three years ago when I had a mental breakdown, sought help, and realized how much I had hurt her. My own childhood trauma had been driving me to overcompensate as a parent.

Since then, I’ve taken on much more of the duties she used to handle. I now do most of the housework—cleaning, cooking, doing laundry, and homeschooling the kids—while also planning special outings and making time for her. I even took on a second remote job because she said she was worried about finances and didn’t want to get a job she didn’t like.

Here’s what a typical day looks like:

* I wake up at 3 a.m. to start my first job. Around 9 a.m., I take a break to make breakfast for the kids and get them started on their day.
* My wife wakes up around 10:30 a.m., and I have her separate breakfast and coffee ready. She usually goes to the gym around 11:30 a.m., and during that time, I continue homeschooling the kids and clean the house—mopping, sweeping, doing dishes, laundry, and bathrooms—so she doesn’t have to.
* I make lunch so it’s ready when she gets back from the gym.
* Around 2 p.m., I start my second job, and she takes over homeschooling, but I still get up frequently to help with the younger kids or whatever else she asks.
* Around 4 p.m., she either runs errands, takes a break to read or watch a show, or asks for more help. I move from my office to take the kids out to the park or for a walk if I don’t have meetings.
* I cook dinner around 6 p.m., and we eat at 6:30 p.m. Sometimes she stays in our room, and I bring her food.
* By 8 p.m., I try to get some time alone with her by going out while our oldest (13) babysits, but it’s hit or miss whether she’s interested. We usually manage this about once a week.
* I get the kids to bed by 9:30 or 10 p.m., and she goes to bed around 10:30 p.m. I usually don’t sleep in the same room because she says I wake her up when I come in late.
* After putting the kids to bed, I finish any remaining work until about midnight, then try to get a few hours of sleep before the cycle starts again.

Despite all of this, she’s now telling me she doesn’t want to be married anymore and that I’m not good enough for her. She made it clear that the only reason she’s waiting to divorce is because she wants me to buy a house first. Until then, she wants our relationship to remain platonic.

I feel used, exhausted, and lost. I don’t know what to do next. Any advice?",1,1728576487.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

With thoughtful design and strategic planning, you can create an inviting atmosphere that caters to the needs of everyone in the household. Here are some effective strategies and ideas to help you make the most out of your home.

### Open Concept Living

Open concept designs can make your home feel larger and more connected. By reducing the number of walls between the kitchen, dining, and living areas, you invite natural light to flow freely throughout the space. This layout not only fosters interaction among family members but also enhances the overall ambiance of the home. Here are a few points to consider:

- **Use multi-functional furniture:** Choose pieces that serve multiple purposes. For example, a coffee table with built-in storage can help keep the living area tidy, while a sleeper sofa offers additional sleeping arrangements for guests.
- **Define spaces with rugs:** Area rugs can visually segment different areas in an open layout. This allows you to create distinct areas for dining, relaxing, and playing without the need for physical barriers.

### Smart Storage Solutions

Efficient storage is key to maintaining order in a family home. Think creatively about how to utilize every nook and cranny. Here are some ideas:

- **Vertical storage:** Consider shelving that goes up to the ceiling. Tall bookcases not only provide ample space for books and decorations but also draw the eye upward, making the room feel larger.
- **Under-stair storage:** If you have stairs in your home, the space beneath them is often overlooked. Use that area to create a small closet, shelves, or even a cozy reading nook.
- **Bench with storage:** Install benches with built-in compartments in entryways or mudrooms. They offer a place to sit while putting on shoes and help keep shoes and bags organized.

### Flex Spaces

Having dedicated rooms for specific purposes can be limiting, especially as children grow and family dynamics change. Instead, create flex spaces that can adapt to various needs. These areas can serve multiple functions:

- **Playroom/Guest Room:** Use a spare bedroom as a play area for young children and easily convert it into a guest room when relatives visit. A fold-out couch can provide a comfy sleeping spot.
- **Office/Exercise Room:** If you're working from home or need an exercise area, dedicate a room that can serve both purposes. Use a desk that can fold away when not in use, or add a yoga mat that can easily be rolled up.

### Maximize Natural Light

Natural light can dramatically enhance the feeling of space in your home. Maximizing light can make any room feel bigger and more welcoming. Here are some tactics to employ:

- **Light-colored walls:** Light colors reflect more light, helping a room feel airy. Consider soft whites, creams, or pastels for your walls.
- **Mirrors:** Strategically placing mirrors can create an illusion of depth and help light bounce around the room, making it appear more spacious.
- **Window treatments:** Use sheer curtains or shades that can be pulled aside completely to let in as much sunlight as possible.

### Outdoor Spaces

Don't forget about outdoor areas. Creating inviting and functional outdoor spaces can extend your living area. Here are some suggestions:

- **Create defined zones:** Use outdoor furniture to define areas for dining, lounging, and playing. Consider adding a patio or deck that can be used during warmer months.
- **Choose durable materials:** Invest in durable outdoor furniture that can withstand the elements. This will ensure you can enjoy your outdoor spaces for years to come.

By implementing these strategies, you can transform your family home into a functional environment that meets all your needs. Emphasizing space and functionality allows your home to grow with you, ensuring comfort and happiness for all family members.

### Conclusion

When it comes to designing a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house, innovation and functionality are key. Homeowners today seek features that enhance daily living while making the best use of available space. By incorporating open floor plans, multifunctional rooms, and well-placed storage solutions, you can transform an ordinary layout into a functional family haven.

Innovative features like smart home technology, energy-efficient appliances, and creative zoning can significantly improve your living experience. For instance, a tech-enabled kitchen or a dedicated workspace allows families to adapt to changing needs without sacrificing aesthetics. Meanwhile, thoughtful designs such as pocket doors or built-in shelving can help maximize what might seem like tight quarters, offering both style and practicality.

Furthermore, the importance of outdoor living spaces cannot be overstressed. Integrating patios or balconies with sliding doors allows for easy indoor-outdoor flow, enhancing both relaxation and entertainment options for families. This connection to nature not only boosts aesthetic appeal but can also contribute to well-being.

Ultimately, the ideal 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house design reflects a balance of innovative features and space optimization tailored to your family's lifestyle. By prioritizing both practicality and creativity in your home layout, you can create a nurturing environment that supports family bonding while accommodating individuality. Whether you’re building new or renovating, focusing on these aspects will ensure you develop a space that feels welcoming, functional, and uniquely yours.",1,1728576469.0,House1000Designs,0,1.0,False

I noticed in the white collection tray that I have like 2 dozen specs of various sizes (I cannot post pics, they are flat, shaped like fish flakes, the color of popcorn kernel, no wider than 1.5mm). I have been off my period for at least 5 days. 
I am doing a urinalysis tomorrow morning, but was wondering if this is typical for a UTI? 
I have good insurance and if this sounds weird for UTI I can schedule an appointment without a referral for a specialist. 
I know the urine was a bit dark. This was after coffee. My next collection was much lighter. I am drinking plenty of water (almost too much, I am thirsty) and using the restroom a lot. 

No pain or difficulty urinating. Thanks in advance

Thank you in advance to anyone who is able to take a look at this itinerary and give me some feedback.

I did read [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/bj3tnn/ultimate\_visitors\_guide\_to\_nyc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/bj3tnn/ultimate_visitors_guide_to_nyc/) before posting this but sorry if I have asked/missed anything obvious!

I (28) am taking my Fiance to NYC for her 30th birthday in December, she has been before during college but always wanted to go back at Christmas time. This will be my first time in NYC. The main theme will be around sightseeing and Christmas activites. I would also like to have a decent plan for the Friday and Saturday night for having dinner and going bar hopping in one area but I'm finding it quite hard researching this.

other relevant info

* we are flying from the UK
* staying at The Lexington Hotel 511 Lexington Avenue At, E 48th St
* my fiance is vegetarian
* I was hoping for recomendations for breakfast, lunch and dinner near where we are going to be. Breakfast I love the idea of bagels/coffee shops/quick and easy but didn't know if you just wing this or would be able to recommend anything near where we will be? Lunch I was looking to mainly spend $20pp no idea if this limits me to takeout or burger places? Dinner I am hoping for $100pp
* i have $30 allowance at stinger cocktail bar near(ish) our hotel and wanted to make the most of it so will aim to go there for cocktails/wine before our evening meal.
* we are hoping to buy wedding bands in tiffany
* there are gaps 14th, 15th and 16th so any suggestions on things to do. I've considered 9/11 memorial, brooklyn tour, Macys, any holiday markets (already going merchants' gate), more than one walk in central park is fine

Anyways, I ate takeout yesterday that is usually a safe choice and within 3 hours I was completely distended (looked about 5 months pregnant easily) and had extreme sharp twisting pain in the middle of my stomach and on the R lower side. I took gasX, tried THC, heat pad and heating blanket and ended up in a puking/straining cycle on the toilet all night long unable to sleep due to the pain and discomfort. Today I am still suffering (only thing that has reduced is the bloating/distention) and have no idea how to help. I’ve tried ginger tea, coffee, liquid IV, and more gasX but still having insane sharp twisting pain especially if in any position other than laying flat down or if anything touches my stomach including clothes… 
Please help and send tips or tricks for resolution of this pain and also general advice for IBS as both GI and my family GP kindly told me that there’s nothing more they can do for me it’s “just ibs” and i will “have to find ways to live with it”. ",1,1728576262.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

It will be mainly used for coffee pot and americano type of coffee and various hot and cold milk combinations.

From what I saw the Primadonna Class can't make cold drinks? If so the battle will be between the Rivelia and the Elleta Explore. But are there any notable differences?

1g0m7cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/KnowCigars/comments/1g0m7cu/cigar_101_basics/,Cigar 101 Basics ,"Cigar 101 is a guide to understanding the fundamentals of cigars, from their components to how to enjoy them. Here’s a breakdown of the essential knowledge you need:

1. Cigar Anatomy

	•	Wrapper: The outermost leaf, which gives the cigar much of its flavor and appearance. Wrappers come in various shades, from light to dark, with Connecticut (light) and Maduro (dark) being common types.
	•	Binder: This is the leaf that holds the filler tobacco together, playing a structural role.
	•	Filler: The innermost tobacco leaves that make up the bulk of the cigar. The filler can be long (whole leaves) or short (chopped leaves), and the blend of filler tobaccos significantly influences the flavor.
	•	Cap: The closed end of the cigar, which you cut before smoking.

2. Cigar Shapes and Sizes

Cigars come in various shapes and sizes, often referred to as vitolas. The two major categories are Parejos (straight-sided cigars) and Figurados (irregularly shaped cigars). Common sizes include:

	•	Corona: 5.5 x 42
	•	Robusto: 5 x 50
	•	Torpedo: Similar to parejos but with a pointed cap
	•	Churchill: 7 x 47

3. Cigar Strength and Flavor

Cigars can range from mild to full-bodied. Mild cigars are smoother and often have creamy or nutty flavors, while fuller-bodied cigars deliver richer, spicier, and more intense flavors. The strength is influenced by the blend of tobacco used, especially from countries like Nicaragua (strong) or the Dominican Republic (milder).

4. Cigar Etiquette

	•	Cutting: Use a proper cigar cutter to remove the cap, ensuring a clean cut for a good draw.
	•	Lighting: Light a cigar with wooden matches or a butane lighter. Avoid using candles or regular lighters to prevent unwanted flavors.
	•	Puffing: Cigars are meant to be puffed, not inhaled. Take slow, gentle puffs to enjoy the flavors and prevent the cigar from burning too hot.
	•	Ashing: Allow the ash to naturally fall when it’s ready—don’t tap it off like a cigarette.
	•	Cigar Storage: Store cigars in a humidor at around 70% humidity and 70°F to keep them fresh.

5. Popular Cigar Regions

	•	Cuba: Known for its premium cigars, like Cohiba and Montecristo.
	•	Nicaragua: Produces rich and full-bodied cigars, such as Padron and My Father Cigars.
	•	Dominican Republic: Known for smoother cigars, like Arturo Fuente and Davidoff.
	•	Honduras: Produces cigars with earthy and spicy notes, like Punch and Camacho.

6. Aging and Storing Cigars

Cigars can improve with age, much like wine. Keeping them in a properly maintained humidor can allow the flavors to mellow and blend over time. Some cigars are specifically crafted for aging and can develop more complex flavors after several years.

7. Common Pairings

Cigars are often enjoyed with beverages such as:

	•	Coffee: Particularly with creamy, mild cigars.
	•	Whiskey/Bourbon: A favorite pairing with medium to full-bodied cigars.
	•	Rum: Complements sweet, spicy cigars, especially those with Maduro wrappers.

8. How to Choose a Cigar

For beginners, start with a mild cigar, like a Macanudo or a Romeo y Julieta 1875, and work your way up to medium and full-bodied cigars as you develop your palate. Consider the time you have to smoke, as larger cigars will require more time, while smaller cigars like Coronas or Robustos are quicker smokes.

9. Common Cigar Terms

	•	Draw: The airflow when puffing on a cigar. A good draw should be smooth and easy.
	•	Retrohaling: Exhaling smoke through the nose to experience more complex flavors.
	•	Ring Gauge: The diameter of the cigar, measured in 64ths of an inch. For example, a cigar with a 50 ring gauge is 50/64 of an inch in diameter.

By understanding these basics, you’ll be well on your way to enjoying cigars like a seasoned aficionado.",1,1728576053.0,KnowCigars,0,1.0,False

So I’m gonna talk with my therapist about this in a couple of weeks when I see him.

Basically yesterday I left work visited my uncle in the hospital then I drove to my grandma in her nursing home

On the way back, home I was a lil hungry so I got a smoothie at this coffee place I go to.

And took my order and when I got to the window

The server like, I wasn’t gawking at her or leering but like something I noticed immediately was that she had like really pretty hands 

Like they looked just like super soft and just like atheistically pleasing


 She asked for my number, for the reward program and I guess it shows you the birthday  of the customer

And like she asked me, is my birthday St Patrick’s day

And I was like, yes it is, and she said that’s cool

And I decided to say another lil fun fact cause my dad is actually from Ireland, like actual Irish not the my great grandpas uncles roommate.

She reacted with like a smile on her face a big bright one.

And she didn’t cuss but she said audibly “holy shot that’s cool”

And she asked if I had an Irish name 

Which I do it’s Liam which is short for Uilliam which comes from a Frankish Germanic word actually  called Willahelm 

And then I got my drink and said good bye and thank you 


I just I feel weird cause well if I’m honest with myself I’m super lonely and empty.

And before I get the lecture yes I know your supposed to love yourself and self care 

Yes I’m working on it, going to therapy, diet and exercise I’ve lost 40lbs.

I still feel like I’m entitled to feel and yearn for romantic companionship 

I have family and friends but I still yearn for romance,  not just sex but like actual love and companionship 


But I just I feel weird cause, she’s at work and I know she was just being nice and it’s customer service

But it felt weird and good, that someone like actually asked me a question about myself and found it interesting 

It’s just weird.

I know it wasn’t flirting, like woman being nice isn’t flirting 


Unfortunately in my dumb brain I latch onto people who are nice to me as much as I’m aware and it pains me, I get attached to people really hard who are nice to me, platonic and if it’s a woman I can crush hard and it evolves into limerence 

(I’m not gonna stalk her or anything I know nothing will come of it nor was it or intentions also like it’s just not appropriate cause she’s in work)


Also it felt weird cause like she’s conventionally attractive in guess.

Like she reminds me of the generic popular annoying girl in highschool 

Like the ones I used to despise some cause of the way they’d treat special ed and autistic kids in the school.

Like basically treat them as preforming monkeys. Pretend to ask them out.

Like the worst form of bullying 

The ones that are complete assholes and are like I wanna be a nurse!!

But the woman in the window like, I dunno she was just pretty 


I’m not like fuck ugly, or anything I used to thing i was but im just adverage 

And my motivation for weight loss is 75% health and wellness the other 25% is to be a lil more physically attractive and just improve the looks I got 


I dunno I just feel weird about the whole thing and im pissed off im making it weird 

Like I had to stop at an ATM and I was thinking like  replaying the interaction in my head and like I should have told her how to say thank you very much in Irish

Which is “go raibh míle maith aga”

I dunno like, I just feel weird about the whole thing and I feel like I’m making a mountain out of a mole hill 

I think it has to deal with the fact that October marks like 4 years since I’ve dated anyone 

And I’ve been in a real downer mood lately and doing stupid impulsive shit to distract myself like spending money I don’t have.


The last time something like this happened was at my old job I used to go to subway a lot and there was this one cashier who was like just my type my complete type, she was just really fucking pretty and had this sweet voice

I just I felt a lot of shame, like I wasn’t like objectifying her or looking her up and down.

I know about like infatuation, and like how yeah she’s pretty but she can easily just be an asshole 


Also I have the tendency as embarrassing and sad as it is I have put woman on a pedestal.

I went into the Scottsdale, AZ location at fashion square and the greeter was nice enough when I said I wanted to do a tasting before buying so she signed me up and told me to wait at the main counter. Here is where it goes bad. I’m just browsing around as the sales lady is helping another couple out and she asks “do you want to taste the pumpkin spice too?” I politely decline and said “no, I’m ok thank you.. I’m here to try the other flavors out since I got a new machine.” She rudely replies with “well, what do you want be cause we don’t sample coffees here. You can only try the pumpkin spice right now since that’s what we’re promoting.” So I asked, “oh ok.. I mentioned to the lady up front I wanted to try some of the regular flavors such as hazelnut and vanilla before I buy sleeves, can I not do that?”. Her response was “no, you cannot. That’s not how this works. You can only try the pumpkin spice right now. We don’t sample anything”. Which I ask, “so, how do I know what I want to buy if I can’t try any of the regular flavors?” Her, “you just have to buy them and if you don’t like them, don’t buy them again”.  I decided that I wasn’t going to purchase from her and left. But as I was walking around the malls, I saw a man with a nespresso bag so I ask him “how he knew what flavors he liked if they don’t let you try anything?” His response was “that’s odd, I have definitely gone in to try different flavors out”. I’m not sure if this is a normal experience at nespresso boutiques but I’m rather turned off from buying anything from them at this point. Thoughts? ",0,1728575871.0,nespresso,5,0.5,False

I just I feel weird cause well if I’m honest with myself I’m super lonely and empty.

And before I get the lecture yes I know your supposed to love yourself and self care 

Yes I’m working on it, going to therapy, diet and exercise I’ve lost 40lbs.

I still feel like I’m entitled to feel and yearn for romantic companionship 

I have family and friends but I still yearn for romance,  not just sex but like actual love and companionship 


But I just I feel weird cause, she’s at work and I know she was just being nice and it’s customer service

But it felt weird and good, that someone like actually asked me a question about myself and found it interesting 

It’s just weird.

I know it wasn’t flirting, like woman being nice isn’t flirting 


Unfortunately in my dumb brain I latch onto people who are nice to me as much as I’m aware and it pains me, I get attached to people really hard who are nice to me, platonic and if it’s a woman I can crush hard and it evolves into limerence 

(I’m not gonna stalk her or anything I know nothing will come of it nor was it or intentions also like it’s just not appropriate cause she’s in work)


Also it felt weird cause like she’s conventionally attractive in guess.

Like she reminds me of the generic popular annoying girl in highschool 

Like the ones I used to despise some cause of the way they’d treat special ed and autistic kids in the school.

Like basically treat them as preforming monkeys. Pretend to ask them out.

Like the worst form of bullying 

The ones that are complete assholes and are like I wanna be a nurse!!

But the woman in the window like, I dunno she was just pretty 


I’m not like fuck ugly, or anything I used to thing i was but im just adverage 

And my motivation for weight loss is 75% health and wellness the other 25% is to be a lil more physically attractive and just improve the looks I got 


I dunno I just feel weird about the whole thing and im pissed off im making it weird 

Like I had to stop at an ATM and I was thinking like  replaying the interaction in my head and like I should have told her how to say thank you very much in Irish

Which is “go raibh míle maith aga”

I dunno like, I just feel weird about the whole thing and I feel like I’m making a mountain out of a mole hill 

I think it has to deal with the fact that October marks like 4 years since I’ve dated anyone 

And I’ve been in a real downer mood lately and doing stupid impulsive shit to distract myself like spending money I don’t have.


The last time something like this happened was at my old job I used to go to subway a lot and there was this one cashier who was like just my type my complete type, she was just really fucking pretty and had this sweet voice

I just I felt a lot of shame, like I wasn’t like objectifying her or looking her up and down.

I know about like infatuation, and like how yeah she’s pretty but she can easily just be an asshole 


Also I have the tendency as embarrassing and sad as it is I have put woman on a pedestal.

1g0m173,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1g0m173/byu_student_with_questions/,BYU student with questions,"I (18f) have asked multiple questions in this subreddit. I’m not exactly LDS/Mormon (or whatever lifts your skirt), but I am an active student at BYU with a religious calling (kinda an awesome one, too). I have a lot of questions for you guys.



1. Why are exmos so angry? I have some crazy beef against another religion (my own personal views), but I would never stand outside their place of worship or scream in the midst of their religious meetings (referencing General Conference a few years back during that loud objection). I’ve been singled out, shamed, and even had my shirt lifted in different experiences with the church, but I pin that to be on the people. Is it the religion itself you guys dislike, or the people? 



2. What are your honest-to-goodness beliefs on premarital sexual acts? I guess this is more personal, to each their own, but I’ve always wondered this. I’ve had sex, but I felt incredibly guilty each time. I did tell my bishop and whatever, but now, being in my own sorta space religiously, I’m not sure how I feel about it. I do believe sex is sacred in some sense, that it should be an intimate connection, but I guess I’m just not sure how I view it in regards to marriage. I want your thoughts. Keep in mind that I was also told by my bishop on both occasions I admitted to having sex that I should, “pray my husband will look past my actions and find it in his heart to forgive me.” 



3. Did I ever tell you guys the ex-head researcher of the church or whatever got asked what they could change about the church to make it better? This guy, an old family friend of ours, was somewhere high in researching the statistics in the church (he’s since quit and left the church). He recounted, a few years back, how one of the apostles, when he was explaining the church was promoting and creating too many pamphlets and rulings, an apostle that strongly disliked him was grinning and giving him “friendly” slaps on the wrist and back while telling him to get out. When he did decide to quit, he had a one-on-one with either Holland or Uchtdorf in which they directly said, “How can we make this church more appealing?” Not relevant. Just think about that a lot. If you guys want, I can get in contact with him and ask him more specifics.


4. Why do exmos (sorry these are all general, not trying to assign these traits to you guys) make the church seem so incredibly bad? I dress an alt/emo style that makes me stick out like a sore thumb (I fucking hate that phrase, Jesus Christ.) and I wear short shorts, crop tops, etc. and I don’t get condemned. A lot of us cuss freely, debate the church (with our classes and bishops), drink coffee/tea, and a lot of people have tattoos. I’ve expressed my doubts and had soft discussions with professors. Agree to disagree type of deals. And they still like me. Even when I wasn’t at BYU, in my ward back home I still discussed my questions freely with my bishops. It just seems like there’s a lot of unneeded resentment. I understand the financial issues and the issues regarding minors in the church (again, as a minor a YWs leader lifted my shirt up to see my bra) but…okay never mind that sounds terrible when I say it out loud. I think I’d murder her if I saw her, and I wouldn’t put my kids in that position. Anyway, my question still stands.

When stories seem to circumvent the basic human needs they seem less real, less possible, and sometimes the lack of such things can break believability. 

So today's tip is to think about food in your world. A lot of human history is dedicated to the production, storage, and rationing of food. Cities cannot exist without supporting farmland or some other technology to feed the population.

How do the people in your story feed themselves? What are some favorite foods or local delicacies that the locals don't actually like? 

Food doesn't have to play a part in a story, but it needs to be in the back of the characters' heads. We all like to know where the next meal is coming from.

But sometimes food does play a part in the story. Francis Prose, in Reading Like A Writer, argues that in the western world meals are symbolically linked to the Last Supper, a Christian story of Jesus' final meal with his disciples before he was executed. Many religions have food laws that seek to limit what the people can eat and who they can eat it with. Jewish customs worked to preserve and strengthen the Jewish community when they were surrounded by non-believers. 

The preparation of food, because it's something we all do, can add a feeling of reality to the story as well. In The Long Goodbye, Chandler depicts Philip Marlowe making a cup of coffee for a friend in a rather tense moment in the book. He even points out that he was treating these everyday details as more important than usual because of the situation, the strange need to ritualize a task. It allows tension to rise in the story but also made it very real to the current readers.

Ik it hasn’t been long, but bear with me because this whole situation is kinda confusing and idk what to do. 

When I first saw this guy, I thought “omg he’s exactly my type” but also thought there was no way I would ever actually get a chance with him. We swapped instagram’s and I thought that was that. But then he dm’d me the next day, was super flirty, and over the next few times we had set up a day to hangout. 

This is honestly part of where I think things may have gone wrong, because both of us only ever referenced them as “hangouts” and never “a date”. But in my eyes, it totally was a date. He drove to my place to pick me up, came to the door, took us to coffee and paid, then took me to watch the sunset and the buffalo at a nearby lookout. Am I crazy for thinking that’s a date?

We hung out for 5 hours, and only stopped because I had to get ready for work. During our time he had even mentioned other fun “hangout” ideas like taking me golfing and teaching me how to snowboard later on. He also said that it’s been a while since he’d done this with someone, in reference to our hangout. When I got back home he was already texting me how much fun he had and that he can’t wait to see me Sunday since we had already planned to hang that day as well. 

The next 2 times we hung out over the course of 2 weeks, it truly was just a hangout. I went over to his place and we watched football and ate dinner. The last time I’ve saw him he had invited me over to spend the night because we had to be at the same place the next day, and he said we could just carpool. 

All during the while, I’m over here catching some feelings probably way too fast. He’s a very physically affectionate person—which I love,— has the exact same type of humor as me, all of our mutuals have nothing but good things to say about him, and he’s just my type. 

But that morning after I spent the night is where I’m not quite sure what happened. When I woke up, my mom called because she needed help moving boxes out of storage, and he had a haircut appointment as well, so we both split up and said that we would just see each other later that night during our event. I could tell vibes were a little off that morning. He didn’t seem as energetic as he usually did, and wasn’t joking with me half as much as previous times. But I brushed it off at the time.

When we got to our event though, I felt as if he was acting like he didn’t even know me. He had mentioned previously when we were together that personal and professional life was a hard line that he always kept separate. So I did contribute some of that coldness to the fact that we were in a work environment and he was busy doing his job, but still I couldn’t help but get a little whip lash and the utter nothingness I was getting out of him. Ik it’s an extreme jump, but I’m an over-thinker, and all of our interactions at this time definitely made me felt like he was just not that into me anymore.

The event spanned over 3 days. Typically we’re both not very fast at responding over text as both of us have very busy lives (some days he literally has work and school from 4am - 7pm) but during these days my texts went unanswered for at least 8 hours, and sometimes it even took days when it hadn’t been like that previously. 

Some of his friend that were there with us had mentioned to me that his vibes were definitely off and moral seemed low, so I thought to check in at least. After the event was all wrapped up, I did reach out and ask him if he was doing ok. 

He told me: “I’ll be honest not good. But in a way of if I just need to ride the wave and it’ll get better with time and there’s not a lot else that can happen. I appreciate you’re checking up on me, means a lot”

This did soothe a little bit of my nerves about the whole thing. It’s just that ever since then, I’m lucky to get a response twice a day. I know that if he’s in a bad mental state rn, then texting honestly might just be hard rn. My problem is I have no idea where I stand at the moment. 

We have never said anything was a date previously, so are we even dating? We’ve been doing domestic stuff together when I’m at his place and we’re just chilling, but both of those times we did end up sleeping together. So is this just fwb?? 

I have never had a serious relationship. He is the second guy I’ve ever slept with, and he is also the first guy that I could see something more serious with. My standards are high and I refuse to settle, so actually being with someone who has checked all of my boxes is crazy for me and I don’t want to lose him in whatever capacity that may be. 

If he’s in a depressive episode right now, I want to be there for him, but because I’m not sure where we stand, I’m not sure what I can do that wouldn’t be overstepping. Because of all that I’ve kinda left the ball in his court. If he wants to hang out, I’ll let him ask. I want everything to be out of his willingness and not because he feels pressure if I ask. 

Right now in my head I’m just trying to emotionally detach I guess. All of my friend have said that I haven’t known him long, and that they’ve been played this way before too. When a guy say they have something going on but are just hiding the fact that they’re losing interest. 

**TL;DR; : What do I do from here? I’ve only known this guy for a month, I’ve already caught feelings, but now idk if he’s genuinely doing bad mentally or just needs an excuse. Do I just keep texting with him and see if he gets better eventually and asks me out again? But then idk how long that will take. And is it weird to hold out hope and wait that long for someone who I essentially haven’t even known that long? Or do I take this as a sign that I should just let it fade out and it was only ever a fwb situation for him?",2,1728574827.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

At the moment i find it pretty easy to lose weight, even the headaches are subduing. Do also have some problems with my intestines, but all by all it's alright. 

Today i felt like cooking me some chicken broccoli & Brown rice, quite lovely on a hungry stomach, but it is already 18:00 and i feel like i could easily fast until next morning. 

Next to my morning coffee and some water, I haven't had anything to eat since yesterday evening at 19:00 where i had some lovely sushi with a friends. 

So fasting today until 12 tomorrow, could it be bad or just all okay if i feel like it?

Get ready for a fun baking adventure as we show you how to make a delicious Brownie Bottom Cheesecake. This dessert is a mix of gooey brownies and creamy cheesecake.

To start, prepare the brownie base. First, preheat your oven and grease a springform pan. Then, mix dry ingredients like flour, cocoa powder, and sugar. Add wet ingredients like eggs, butter, and vanilla extract. Spread the batter in the pan and bake until it’s done.

Now, let’s make the cheesecake filling. In a big bowl, mix cream cheese, sugar, eggs, and vanilla until smooth. Pour this batter over the brownie base for an even layer.

1. Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C).
2. Grease a 9-inch springform pan.
3. Prepare the brownie base by mixing the dry and wet ingredients.
4. Spread the brownie batter evenly in the prepared pan and bake for 25–30 minutes.
5. In a separate bowl, mix the cream cheese, sugar, eggs, and vanilla for the cheesecake filling.
6. Carefully pour the cheesecake batter over the baked brownie base.

Bake the Brownie Bottom Cheesecake for 55–65 minutes, or until it’s almost set. Let it cool completely before removing the pan. Refrigerate it for at least 4 hours, or better yet, overnight, to enhance flavors and texture.

Making the perfect Brownie Bottom Cheesecake is more than just a recipe. To get a smooth, crack-free top, remember a few key tips. These expert techniques will help you bake a top-notch dessert every time.

**Preventing Cracks in Your Cheesecake**

One big challenge in baking a Brownie Bottom Cheesecake is avoiding cracks. Start by greasing your baking pan well. You might also line the bottom with parchment paper for easy removal. *Avoid over-mixing the cheesecake batter* to prevent air bubbles that can cause cracks.

Bake the cheesecake at a lower temperature, around 325°F (165°C), for a longer time. This slow baking helps the center cook evenly without the edges getting too hard and cracking. Also, don’t open the oven door too often, as this can make the cheesecake collapse and crack.

Let the cheesecake cool slowly, first in the oven with the door ajar, then on a wire rack at room temperature. *Rapid cooling can trigger cracking*, so be patient and let it cool down slowly.

>***“Baking the perfect Brownie Bottom Cheesecake is all about controlling the temperature and avoiding sudden changes. With a little patience and the right techniques, you can achieve a flawless, crack-free dessert every time.”***

There’s nothing I can do and I feel so broken and hurt. What can I do?,"For context, I just met him recently on a case 7 day competition trip. I only just knew him on the third day of the trip. At first I felt that he was pretty nice and had a weird sense of humor that I vibed with, I didn’t thought much of it as we were just friends. But as the days passed, I always felt like I wanted to spend more time with him, looked around the room for him and seems like I was always scanning the room for him. Looking back on it, a lot of the activities I did in the evening was just because I wanted to spend time with him. I mean I was fine with those activities but it really did not matter as long as I was spending the time with him. On the 6th day, we had to make pitch decks for our own separate group. I kinda told him that I was so tired and couldn’t think anymore so I asked him to grab coffee at 11 pm. The first shop we went to was closed and so on so we took about an hour just to get coffee. I mean normally other people would just told me to get one at the vending machine in our hotel but he walked legit the whole area with me just to get us coffee. After we came back, I was still dealing with the presentations and eventually told him I was going to come down to the lobby and finish it there because I couldn’t do it in my room anymore. He came down to check on me at 1 a.m. 2 am and eventually stayed there with me from 3 am till 6 am just because “I looked tired”. Even though he still wasn’t finished with his, he still stayed with me the entire night. After 6 am, I wanted to go take a short walk to stretch and he also came with me offering to carry my stuff and walk through everything with a computer in hand. The next day on the day of the competition, he called to wake me up because he knew I wouldn’t be able to because I had just an hour of sleep. Throughout my pitch he was always there giving me support and even cheered for me when my group got into the semi-finals when his group did not. Stayed through my second pitch and gave me countless support when I was done with the presentation. 
The last night we all went as a group to the club and so I was starting to question if I had feelings for him but I didn’t want to feel anything before asking him if he was in a relationship ( up to this point I had no clue if he had a gf or not there were no signs). When we started to get a little tipsy, I worked up the courage to ask him if he had a gf. He said he had one and it was like my heart was broken into pieces. It hurt from the inside out but I acted like I was fine from the outside and knew that from that point on, I can only treat him as a friend. After that, he had some problems with his gf because he went to a club and also because he took pictures of his surrounding and I was always with him. 
After coming back from the trip, he blocked me on all social media platforms ( understandingly because I was the cause of problems). I just found out that he dedicated a playlist on his spotify for me with songs that I have recommended him and he also have me plus other songs like
- There goes my baby
- To build a home
- Sweet (cigarettes after sex)
- ex i never had
- war (keshi)
- 20191009 i like her
- i’d rather pretend
and also added other songs to his playlist “Are you in love?” 
I also just found out after that all of our friends knew that he had feelings for me. I feel so broken and hurt from the inside right now. Because he treated me like i was a special person even though he had a gf. I have so much feelings for him but I can’t do anything about it. I never got to knew or experience the what ifs. I am so hurt because what if we haven’t gotten this close and I wouldn’t be this hurt and torn apart. How do I proceed in life really. Right now I can’t seem to do anything.

Hiya! Not sure what to feel about this interaction this morning except feeling a bit… mortified. 

I got some coffee from my town centre before starting work this morning and on the walk back to my car, thought I’d get a Greggs vegan roll (as you do) as I was peckish. 

At the tills, the card machine kept saying ‘insert or swipe card only’ - not tap as it usually does. So my apple pay on my phone wasn’t doing anything.. I use Monzo and there was no notifications on my phone of a Greggs transaction or anything being declined. 

Anyway I explained that I’d used my phone around 1 minute before to pay for my coffee but the lady at the till kept insisting my phone should make a noise, but when I asked her to cancel the transaction so we could try again, she refused to. 

Anyway the women on the till next to me, got a bit huffy and said ‘the time I was taking was annoying her’ and stepped in to pay. I thanked her many times and asked her for a details to pay it back but she declined. Ironically she paid on her till by tapping with her phone, but my till wasn’t working (the lady at the till admitted it had been playing up). 

Anyway, after she paid I thanked her again and said ‘I’m sure there was something wrong with the till’ and laughed. 

She looked at me dead straight in the eye, smiled and said very condescendingly ‘It wasn’t the tills.’ 

I felt like I wanted the ground to swallow me up at that point haha, but I smiled back, took the pasty and left. 

I do wonder - if you’re going to do a good deed for someone, don’t be condescending? Part of me wanted to leave the pasty there and tell her to stick it! 

I will pay it forward to someone else, but it felt ultra awkward, I would have left the shop without paying and left the roll.

Looking for advice on how to proceed.,"We go to university together, have a class together, and are on the debate team together. He's a freshman, so only 18, and I'm a bit of an older student at 27. He's a smart, good-natured guy and we work well together as teammates. Comes from a small midwestern town, and according to him his family is very conservative and ""very Jewish."" He says he feels like a fish out of water at our small liberal arts school, and I do feel for him there. I tend to give him the benefit of the doubt regarding politics considering his age, background, demeanor, and overall level of life experience at this point. And he's asked me some genuine, intellectually curious questions about socialism in the past before. Yesterday, right before the start of our fall break, he came to me said that he only felt comfortable approaching me about something since he felt afraid to ask anyone else, and revealed that his grandparents on both sides of his family are Holocaust survivors and until coming to school here he was completely under the impression that everyone thought Israel was completely justified and only crazy extremist terrorism-apologists sided with Palestine. He said he feels intimidated and kind of baffled by the fact that everyone in our school seems so thoroughly aligned with Palestine, and he said he wants to talk to me about it more to try and understand where we're coming from. I'm very vocal about Palestine on my campus and often announce local fundraisers, protests, events, etc in my classes. I basically told him that if we wanted to give this topic its due diligence we should plan a time to go get coffee together when we get back from break and expect to have a multi-hour long conversation about this.

The more I think about our conversation yesterday, the more I'm wondering how exactly to go about this. There's so much information to cover, and I want to make sure I do this right and represent things correctly. I feel like there's a right way to go about this, and a correct order of operations for what I should bring up (probably shouldn't start with the goon platoon for instance, lol). I think the video of Hasan with Nick probably isn't a good idea since Nick was starting from a place of relative neutrality and this friend is not. So I'd really like to hear what y'all's thoughts were on what my strat should be, and I'd particularly love to hear from anti-zionist Jews in this community about what to say and how to say it.

I've started rating some mundane stuff like restaurants' coffee, Lindt chocolate, incense and whatever and I'll probably rate ballpoint pens or something.

How can we make this work or share responsabilities so I feel less overwhelmed?","I work full time and go to college part-time. Then i come home, cook, do some things around the house, take care of pets. He does do dishes, but i also pitch in although less there. He does more computer stuff, but when it comes to house stuff he doesn't touch much else. 
He drives and complains about driving me to and from work, but to me that's unreasonable bc i work almost on the same street, so technically as little out of his way as i could find a job. He says that he wastes 30-40 min waiting for me to get out of work bc our schedules differ, but he usually reads during that time, so like in my mind he still does something for himself. This has me considering getting a bike so i don't ask him for anything anymore.
 If there are any other things that come up where customer service needs to be called, i usually do that if i can. He does make more than me tho, and that's another thing he mentiones, although after paying his debts, he brings in about what i do in the actual house.
His mornings are - go to the bathroom, shower, change, drive to work.
My mornings are- go to the bathroom, change, take care of the pets, make lunches and coffee, then join the car. (i didn't include showering bc some days i just don't have time or the energy)
I feel like my mornings are hectic. He said it nicely that he doesn't like our relationship because i don't do enough (he asked me to take a stain out of his pants yesterday and i forgot and to goo gone a mug i was bringing to work (i just put it to dry so i can tackle it at work)). 
He said i never listen to him, that he always does stuff for me and that i never compromise. I said i am doing what i can. What he means by only doing what i want is because i suggested a different hike and he agreed or sometimes because he ""buys me stuff"" but literally our money is coming out from a joint acct, so who's there to say he's not ""buying me stuff"" with my own money. (All the stuff he ""buys me"" is when we go to the store together and we pick stuff together). I also joined college because he wanted a wife with a similar schooling level (he has a bachelors). I don't mind school and i take pride on having a high GPA, but i'm on the fence if i want to complete it here or transfer to a college over-seas.
His complaint is also that i stopped having or initiating sex, but all i asked is for intimacy. He doesn't make me feel beautiful or anything. Sometimes he even tells me i'm fat and i just am not turned on anymore.

I just don't know what to make of all this. Could I manage my time better and take care of more things? pitch in even more? (I come from a culture where the woman does everything for the man, never sat right w me tho)

I’ve been juggling work and school for the past six years, now in my fourth year of architecture. I’m well aware that I often look worn out when I show up to class, a result of heading straight there after my night shift.

This morning, one of my classmates, visibly stressed about schoolwork, saw me and commented on how tired and sleepy I looked. I simply told her that I had just gotten off work. She started asking where I worked, how long I’d been doing it, and other related questions. She was shocked that I was managing both work and school at the same time and then jokingly asked, “Are you su*cidal?” I just smiled and laughed it off.

After class, I went back to my dorm, slept for about four hours, woke up, took a bath, had dinner, smoked a cigarette with coffee, and headed to work again.

A few hours into my shift, I began feeling nauseous, jittery, and like I was having palpitations, almost a panic attack. My mind was racing, thinking, “I don’t have time for this!

1g0kxtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g0kxtq/end_trip_in_singapore_or_ho_chih_min_city/,End trip in Singapore or Ho Chih Min City ,"Hey folks! I'm putting together my itinerary for a trip through SEA and have the option of ending my trip either in Singapore or Ho Chih Min City. Will be visiting KL, Bangkok, Laos and Cambodia before flying to either one of these cities from Phnom Penh. I will have basically a day and a half, will arrive at night (~9pm) on a flight from PP, have the entire next day and then leave on the evening of the 3rd day (~6pm).

I've been to Singapore before and I know how to get around etc and will probably just do city things in my time there, food, coffee, bars etc as I wind down my trip before I head home. 

HCMC just popped up on my radar as an option though and the biggest draw for me is that it's a new place as I've never been to Vietnam. As I've been reading though I see that logistics can be complicated in terms of getting places because of traffic. I'd love to visit the war museum and tunnels but it seems that they're a little outside of the city as well. I guess my biggest concern with HCMC is if I'd just waste a lot of time on logistics considering I'd be there for a rather short period. However, if its a place worth visiting for food, city culture, nightlife and such I wouldn't mind making a quick stop. 

Feel free to chime in with your opinions one way or the other and thanks in advance!


Edit: Thinking HCMC as opposed to Hanoi because Hanoi doesn't have a direct flight back to my home city and the one stop flight takes up an entire day.",1,1728572739.0,travel,2,1.0,False

I am 29 years old and the daughter of a 69 year old raging alcoholic. My dad did not develop a problem until I was 18 years old.

I noticed my dad may have been drinking about ten years ago. I had noticed his odd behavior, and had a few slightly traumatic interactions with him that I won't go into right now. Things would go up and down, but over the last 3-5 years things have seem to taken a turn for the worse. My dad is drunk more than he isn't. He lies, lies some more, and then doubles down on those lies. You'll almost never actually see him drink. He hides his liquor- small whiskey bottles in his pant leg or in his bathrobe pocket. You ask him why his breath smells like alcohol and he'll say that he had just been using mouthwash. He does not party or go to bars, but if I drive around town I can catch him parked at the liquor store when he said he was just running to the gas station. His closet and truck used to be littered with small bottles, until he figured out that we were onto him and finding them. Now I don't even bother looking. He is a horrible, mean drunk. He stumbles and slurs his words. He calls you names and swears under his breath. He says odd out of pocket things and gets this horrible snarl on his face with glazed over eyes. If you saw someone acting this way on the street, you would cross to the other side to avoid them. This is a far cry from what used to be his real and sober personality, which was always friendly and inviting. He is a talented carpenter who is bilingual, he can build or fix almost anything. He used to be interested in music and art, and had hobbies like reading and making jewelry. He was good looking, personable, and smart, and I used to be proud to call him my dad.

Things have gotten really dark lately. My dad drinks daily. I never see him sober anymore. He used to feel remorseful after drunken nights, even cutting off alcohol for the next few days and trying to make it up to everyone. These days- he feels no remorse. Sometimes I wonder if he is still drunk the next morning. He seemingly has no memory of the hurtful things he has said or the way he has acted. He doesn't try to spend any time with our family. He doesn't call me or invite me to coffee or lunch like we used to. He asks me the same questions over and over again when I see him, not remembering anything I've told him from the day before. He is a grandfather to my 5 y/o niece- he makes no effort to take the one hour drive on the weekends to see her or mail a gift. He does not try to get the family together for a meal. He prefers to go to his physically demanding welding job 5-6 days a week, come home around 5:00, and pass out. He barely eats anything at all. He doesn't want to go on a walk or take a ride with my mom to the store. He spends Sunday drunk, and then passes out before 2:00 PM.

My parents are still married. My mom was diagnosed with Parkinsons last year at 65 years old. She retired from work because it was hard for her to continue her job. She has a lot of bad days- it's hard for her to drive and do the things she used to do. I have become her main caregiver- driving and accompanying her to many doctors appointments, helping with groceries, and chores around the house. I also try to take daily walks with her. My mom has continued to be in charge of the household like she has always been- maintaining the yard, banking, taxes, all the things. Since her diagnosis my dad has not stepped up. He does nothing to help her, even refusing an afternoon walk. He works a physically demanding welding job, drinks whiskey somewhere between his job and his ride home, and gets home totally plastered and unable to even hold a conversation.

This puts a lot of stress on me. My mom calls me every night to report to me that he is drunk. I have to put a lot of time into helping her on top of my full time job, marriage, apartment, and cat. I don't sleep well at night because I am worried if something happens to her my dad would be unable to help or drive her to the hospital because he is passed out drunk. It is complicated, because I am an adult, but I still have a lot of ties to my parents and I am committed to taking care of my mom. I have two older siblings who don't live nearby so they aren't faced with how bad it has gotten. My dad is ruining this family and I don't know what to do. I have emailed his brothers, who basically just told me to tell him to ""try AA"". I am at a complete loss.",3,1728572585.0,AlAnon,2,1.0,False

1g0kuni,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1g0kuni/why_cant_i_remember_how_to_get_places/,Why can’t I remember how to get places?,"Hi,

So I’ve been driving to the same grocery store for the past two or three months. It’s 15 minutes away and there are two ways to get there, both of which require getting onto a highway and getting onto the right exit. I’ve gone there AT LEAST 10 or 15 times if I were to estimate. I still need GPS to get there.. mind you. For whatever reason, I have no problem getting home.

Is this a common ADHD issue? It’s one of the most embarrassing things since for example, I drove my friend around the other day and had to have her direct me to how to get to the coffee shop we’ve been to at least 5 times.

I’ve been this way since I was in kindergarten. I was even assigned a fellow classmate to be my “guide” to help me get to class. And I wouldn’t say I’m stupid, either. I’ve taught myself how to animate, draw, am learning Spanish, my last GPA was 4.0 when I was in college after doing 4 or 5 classes, but I CANNOT navigate for the life of me. I can write well, but have been told I “talk like a stupid person and write like I’m smart.” Can’t even do basic math sometimes.

I’ve been diagnosed ADHD but these three things always bother me, the navigation especially, but as well as the vocal communication/mathematics issues, because it’s like my brain isn’t wired for either.",4,1728572511.0,ADHD,12,1.0,False

My gf (f30) and I (f29) have been together almost 2 years. We have had a lot of issues, boundaries set because of certain ppl in our past, mistrust, and drama. 

This guy, let's call him Herbert. Herbert was her ex fling. Not a real relationship. Herbert has no job, cannot drive, stinks, no education and is basically a loser. I am getting my masters and a graduate certificate, working part-time and also as a freelancer. Herbert was the thing before me. She lied about who Herbert was and claimed he was just a friend in December of 2022. He texted her often and it was too suspicious. I found out they met on a dating app in March of 2023 and that's where things made sense. During that time, she brought her mom in the picture to lie for her and say Herbert was just a friend. A family friend at that. Basically putting this guy on a pedestal. At the end of it, I stood my ground and I didn't believe Herbert was just a friend. I never did. She was in tears and didn't want to block him but she did. So in September of 2023, everything comes out. She was still secretly talking to Herbert. Even went to his house and he supposedly kissed her but she didn't reciprocate. In October she finally ended the so called friendship and fessed up that they were never friends. It was a fuck buddy but supposedly just oral and hand. 

Fast forward in March of 2024, Herbert texts her from some random number saying he misses having sex in the shower with her. And I'm like ""huh?? You told me you never had sex sex? And that he was never here? And in the shower also?"" I was so distraught and since then I cannot shower with her anymore or use her shower. I just don't. I think of the stuff they did. And what bothers me is she didn't touch me much in the shower but with him, according to his message, she was on his lap, etc. 

I am not a looker but I'm not what that dude is. He is an ugly dude. I have never questioned my looks and I have always been pretty confident. I used to love my average chunky body and how I looked. I know I have a pretty face and I take care of myself hygienically. But now I compare and compare. 

Anyways, besides not using their sex shower, I cannot go to the bookstore she went with him too or a certain coffee shop. I make an excuse or something. I think she knows why. I want to get past this because yeah I love my gf a lot and after all this stupid bullshit she has put in a lot of effort to make me comfortable. I know she realized her mistakes way too late but I am not perfect either and she has given me chances too. I want to be able to shower with her and adore her body and stuff. But I can't help but think of what that dude said.

What do I do to move past the shower thing and the places? Any advice? Has anyone gone through this?

I want to add that this is her first real relationship. I have been through a couple. She even apologized to me with tears the other day that she was sorry that she put me through so much and that she wishes it was someone else that dealt with her mistakes. The dude isn't in her life anymore but yeah, I'm struggling to move past these things. I am not going to break up with her. Like I said, I did shitty things too and she forgave me. I had a fling also come up but didn't lie about who he was.

I use the improved one cup recipe by James Hoffmann. 

Yesterday: 15g of coffee (20clicks on the comandante C40), 250g of water in 50g steps until 250g are used

Today: I wanted to make a brew containing 350g of water, thus I did the basic maths and ended up with 21g of coffee and 70g steps of water. 

HOWEVER (and this is the point of my question) my comandante grinder was set to 19 clicks and the coffee tasted completely different. At 20 clicks the coffee tasted very floral and there was a wide variety of different notes I tasted. At 19 clicks the coffee tasted like alot of my aeropress brews, quite bitter and not very complex. I thought that grinding one step finer would make those floral notes even more intense. 

Do you think that the bad taste comes from grinding just one click finer or do I have to change something else when increasing the total water amount? I am very new to using a V60 but didn‘t think that one click would make such a difference (I have not the red clicks upgrade on my C40) ",1,1728572474.0,V60,0,1.0,False

i work full time, model and take care of my home. my girlfriend recently moved in with me and i feel like she doesn’t try to carry any weight. i do everything out of love but at times i’m feeling like she’s being ungrateful. i pay the bills, wake up at 5 am to drive her to work before i go to work myself, take a late lunch to bring her home after her shift and head back to work then cook dinner and spend the evening with her. recently, she’s been upsetting me. 

situation 1:
i’m sick (bad allergy cold) but on the way home from work, i grocery shopped and cooked us dinner. i spent the whole evening watching love island with her rather than hang with my friends on the game (she knew i blew them off for her). the next morning i woke up hungry but wanted to hang with my friends before our busy day. i made our coffee and asked if she could reheat my food from the night before for me while i hopped online. she said “give me 30 minutes, i’m not hungry”. i waited 2 hours until i went in my room and she’s on the phone and doing her nails. i reheated my food and went to sit down and she yells “can you bring me a napkin for my toes??”. i said “i’m eating”. she came out and said “you could’ve brought me a napkin you were right there. now i messed up my toes and have to redo them”. she said i was being spiteful by not getting her napkin and that she planned on warming it up after her nails but didn’t know she was being clocked for time to get my food to me in exactly 30 minutes. all i asked was that she communicated this rather than let me wait 2 hours. on top of this, the other day we got into a petty disagreement and afterwards she made herself dinner and nothing for me. it’s just a lack of consideration to me.

last night, i asked her in what ways does she feel that she goes out of her way for me or how does she try to make things easier for me and she was silent for a whole minute until she said “i clean sometimes”..

i lightly brought up how she seems ungrateful because one of the other things she does is complain if i don’t do absolutely everything for her. for example, i take my lunch late everyday to pick her up from work then i head back to work. she grabbed a couple groceries while at work and i let her carry the bags from the car to the door (like 4 of them) and she got upset and said “i’m so tired, my feet hurt and i’ve been working all day. you could at least be carrying these” so i carried half of them. 

finally, last night, she asked me if i’d like her to make me a bagel before work and i said yes. she didn’t. she doesn’t even wake up to say bye to me before i head to the office. 

i hope i’m not over exaggerating or being too hard on her but i’m exhausted and starting to feel taken advantage of. i have a lot to offer financially, i have a wonderful job and i am admittedly attractive and moving up in my modeling and now acting career. my family and friends all tell me i need to watch out for myself in regards to being used by people and i’m just unsure at the moment. before she got here it was all “i’m going to take care of you” but now she doesn’t go out of her way in a thoughtful manner for me in the slightest these days. other than wanting to be intimate. in turn, i’m finding it hard to be intimate and she’s complaining about that as well despite still not changing her behavior.

TLDR:
For context, we met when we were kids, dated on and off and officially moved in together now. My girlfriend recently moved in and puts in very little effort or consideration into our cohabitating. How do i get her to finally see my side and show a little consideration?

He has these metal screens over his windows, completely shielded and he never opens them ever. He NEVER has trash or recycling.

1g0knvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1g0knvk/excited_to_get_started/,Excited to get started!!,"Howdy -- first post to the group, and just looking for some words or thoughts as I start this journey.  So I'm a scout leader and I've been on and led many hikes and camp outs with scouts over the last 10 or so years, both in packs and troops. This includes weekend campouts and week long summer camps.  I also love to hike, family and I when weather isn't blazing (we're in Texas) try to take a 3-5 mile hike once or twice a month plus I walk couple miles daily.

Admittedly I'm a bigger guy who has some weight to loose, but I'm now venturing into backpacking.  I hope to attend a Philmont Trek in 2026, so I have two years to prep-- and this weekend I'm taking my first step. I'm attending a weekend backpacking trip with another troop, and I believe I'm set!  Since I'm just starting I probably don't have the best gear, but testing out my new tent and sleeping pad last night this is the first time I've spent without a cot without my back hurting in a long time, so I hope I've found the right fit.

Pack is a Magellin hiking backpack from Academy, yeah not the best but it's budget and fits my gear - I expect to upgrade when I can so any suggestions are welcome.  I went with the Paria Zion 3P tent, it's rather light and has plenty of room, plus a big agnes wide sleeping pad.  These all have more weight then I'd like for some of the core items, but it's a start.  I use a jet boil for food and coffee, used it for years so I have meals already packed and ready to go plus I love my Aeropress for coffee -- it's a creature comfort :)

I haven't fully packed everything, but I expect the pack to be about 25 lbs give or take.  I'm only taking a change of wool socks for clothes plus a light jacket and not much extra so pack, tent, pad, and food are the bulk of it plus some of the essentials.  Luckily lots of water sources,so I'm taking a couple of Smart water bottles filled and my Sawyer filter.

I expect my gear will improve, and if this weekend goes as I hope (or even if not and I have some buds and thorns to work through) I hope to start the Backpacking Merit Badge with some of the scouts who've shown interest.

1g0kmso,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmexPlatinum/comments/1g0kmso/unnecessary_question_centurion_lounge_in_denver/,Unnecessary Question: Centurion Lounge in Denver,"My husband and I are taking a very early flight out of Denver to Las Vegas in a few weeks. We have only had the AMEX platinum card for about four months now so this will be our first opportunity to use the centurion lounge. 
We are airport people, we like to have a meal and a drink so the $50 fee to get him in the lounge, when available, will definitely be worth it…In normal circumstances.

Our flight is southwest and departs at 6 AM. We arrive at the airport at 4 AM, the lounge opens at 5 AM. The lounge is in the same terminal as Southwest. Assuming our gate is somewhat close to the lounge, is about 30 minutes enough time to grab a coffee and some breakfast right at lounge opening?

If we are able to make a quick dash to grab some food and scarf it down, then I want to experience the lounge. And save the money we’d inevitably spend at Root Down. But if it is usually busy right at opening, then it’s definitely not worth it! 

Like I said, unnecessary question. I am just very excited to use the lounge for the first time, but know that my flight situation might make that impossible.",2,1728571955.0,AmexPlatinum,0,1.0,False

Adam went to his stash, grabbed a bottle of whiskey, a 25-year-old Glenfiddich, and two glasses, and went to the lift. He messaged Roks to bring ice to the top.

The view from the top was impressive, one hundred meters above ground and ending in a black orb that was only transparent from the inside. It was a two-level observation deck. The lower part had workstations, and one day he might have to assign somebody for the job of air controller. The top observation deck had a few comfortable sitting areas and an unfinished bar, unfinished in the manner that it was empty.  Droids didn’t know how to make things cozy, so it was all metallic floor and felt rough.

He found a place with a nice view. Next year, he hoped it would be much greener. The dark red soil was nice, but he would prefer a greener view, maybe a lake.

He heard the lift door open, and somebody walked out and headed to the bar. Then, he heard ice poured into a metal bucket, and a few moments later, Roks put the bucket between them as he sat down.

Adam put one ice cube in each glass and poured them into a glass. None of them spoke as they leaned back and just enjoyed the silence and the view.

“They are going to search for us.” Adam finally said.

“I know; we will be ready. You saw the message; they don’t know our location, so we have to be more careful when we go to the hub. We should wait until we have built more defense.”

“Jork has a few kamikaze drones; we used them to set off the volcanoes, but I don’t know if they are easy to hack. I don’t want them turned against us.”  Adam looked at Roks who seemed to think about it.

“Barro can go over them. He is the second pilot of the heavy. He’s our EWO.”

“What’s an EWO?” Adam finished his drink and poured himself another.

“Oh, Electronic War Operator, military-trained Hacker.  Come to think of it, he should go over our communication security as well.”

“Yeah, that’s a good idea. Can you ask him? We will also need them as pilots as we start mining Nitrogen from the Gas planet.” 

“Which one?” Roks finished his glass and poured himself another glass.

“The biggest, I guess I need to name them. I’ll have the kids help me.” Adam said

“The kids? Well, that won't backfire.” Roks laughed.

Adam grinned. “What is the worst that can happen?”

“So why are we drinking? Not that I mind? Anything to do with the nightmares?” Roks looked at him, and Adam shifted in the chair.

“How do you know?” He looked outside.

“I heard you hit the scream and hit the wall. Later, your hand was found, but I smelled the medical, and there are days you look like you haven’t slept.” He said, and Adam looked back at him.

“Well, wait, you can hear that through the walls? Your room is one floor down from mine.”

Roks chuckled. “Not on Dream. You're right next to me. Besides, you sometimes fall asleep in the captain's chair, and you talk in your sleep. I don’t think ‘no no’ and “please help me” are good dreams. But then again, you're human, so...”

Adam looked away; for a while, he just looked at the whiskey glass, emptied it, and poured himself a new one. Roks waited patiently.

“Yeah, I have nightmares about my childhood.” Adam sighed. “The time before the orphanage. I came there when I was nine years old, before that…” He emptied the glass and looked at the empty glass.  “ Before that, I was a product to be sold.”

“A product? What do you mean?” Roks looked at him, confused.

“I was made for a very wealthy couple. They wanted to choose their baby, but I didn’t make it, so I was keeping it around in case the one they chose needed a donor later. They made six of us. Using the latest in cloning technology.“ Adam sighed, put an ice cube in the glass, and filled it. “I was just number 1 until I was nine; that’s when the organization that made us decided to ship us all to a whorehouse to make some extra money on us. You see, they made children for the rich and famous, helped them get their designer children without the trouble of pregnancy, and then used the spares to make some extra money. Some were trained to be goons for them. We were expendable, and as long as one of us was kept in perfect condition, then the others could be put to work.”  Adam sipped the glass, and Roks just listened, clearly shocked.

“So when I overheard that we had chosen to be sent to the whorehouse, I tried to escape. I managed to get outside of the factory, but then they saw me and tried to catch me. I ran like crazy and then I saw a policeman so I ran over to him. Police officer Michael Wrangler… “He stopped for a second as to remember the man,”  I asked for help, and he said he would, then he tried to call it in. “ Adam stopped again, closed his eyes, then touched his cheek as it had become wet. “They shoot him right in front of me and move over to grab me, but they forgot that the police are never alone. The Lawdroid immediately opened fire, killing them, and his partner ran to grab me and got me to safety. I was in shock, and I honestly don’t remember much until I was in the orphanage. I apparently told the police everything I knew, and they busted the operation. It became a big media case, and some of the children got adopted, but I was so traumatized that when I was over it, people had forgotten, and I was stuck in the orphanage with the leftovers.  So now you know.”

“So what are you? A clone of a human?” Roks poured himself another glass.

“No, and yes, They took genetic material from my mother and father's donors and created me. I’m not a clone of them; I’m genetically a child of them, hence why I don’t have a clone status. I'm human, just made in a lab.”

“Wow, not what I had expected. So the nightmare is about that?”

“Yeah, it comes and goes. Got worse when I started having slaves.” He looks at Roks, who suddenly got it.

“Ohhh.. so my bad? And no cloning, right?”  Roks said.

“We only buy if we can rescue somebody and not to help create a bigger market. As for clones, I’m okay with cloning animals, but once we have a few, they will get to reproduce the old-fashioned way. “

“I can understand that. We need to find some humans as well. Maybe get you a wife?” Roks said as he poured Adam another drink.

“Ha! Find a human out here? Good luck. Now let's drink. I don’t want to think anymore tonight.”

“You should get some music up here and a bartender.”

“Jork said he could build one. But yeah, get somebody to print some speakers and stuff.”

“We can ask the students to do it. It seems to be something for the young ones,” Roks replied. Adam grinned. “Hey, I’m not that old. I’m only 26,” and emptied his glass, then he turned to Roks.

“So what about you? Why did you leave the military? Was it because of your sister?” He ask and Roks nodded slowly.

“I arrested her and Vorts, trying to save their lives, I knew a kill order had gone out. So I arrested them publicly to save my family’s honor and theirs.”  Sighted then finished his drink.

“They don’t look too pissed up about it. Why?”

“If I had not arrested them that day, then they would have been killed the next, and our families would also lose status. This way they went from enemies of the state to exiled slaves instead. I gave the government the opportunity to make a show of them, banished and enslaved never to return home. In their eyes that is the harshest punishment they can give.  Then I was told I could stay a captain for the rest of my life or seek my fortune elsewhere only being allowed ten days per year on the homeworld.” Roks smirked slightly.

“Only an ignorant fool who has never left their home world thinks banishment is a punishment. Kula is a beautiful world but it is possible to live elsewhere.”  He finished his drinks and looked at Adam. “Besides, if I had stayed, I would never have met you.”

“Yeah, you really have bad luck with choosing your friends!” Adam poured them both a glass, and they both laughed.

 

 



It took two days for Adam to function again and he swore never to drink again as he crawled out of the bed. Adam remembered sending one of the Maidy droids for more drinks, but he doesn’t remember much. At one point, Kina came to drag Roks to bed. He thinks she stayed a while to listen to him and Roks discuss something. ( he had no idea what they had talked about )

Adam got out of bed and showered before going to the kitchen for a cup of coffee. Vara appeared to have told the droids to tell her when he was up, and she quickly arrived to give him a full medical check-up. Then she yelled at him for poisoning himself and her brother. In her mind, alcohol was only to be used in moderate amounts. Adam had to promise not to try and kill himself with whiskey again. Which he had agreed to; next time, it would be tequila. She didn’t like the joke.  She gave him something for the hangover, and it vanished after a few minutes. Apparently, she had tried to give him this earlier, but the door was locked, and his droids had ordered him to shoot anyone who tried to enter. Adam laughed as he realized just how drunk he must have been.  He went to the administration and found it filled with life. The kids, students, and Vorts were at stations at ten in the morning. Jork was at the life support department installing a new machine. Outside were ten cubes of ice; each cube was about five times five meters.

“What is that?” He asked, nursing his cup of coffee.

“Frozen nitrogen, don’t worry, they are in a forcefield.  We are testing out concepts. Besides this, we need our life support and the fields.”  Vorts explained. “We used Dream to pick it up.  Jork is working on an insane idea.”

“Oh so he is allowed to have insane ideas?” Adam replied and Vorst nodded.   
“Yes, he is an engineer, your not.” He replied and Adam had no argument against that so he sat down.

“Okey, its time we named the planets of the system. We got Dirt. “He brought up the scan of the system. It showed three planets. There was one closer to the sun than Dirt. After Dirt was the asteroid field, then came a gas planet followed by a mega rock planet and a bigger gas planet, or more a giant asteroid field they had not really explored much off.

“its time to name the rest.” He said. A girl whispered  to the other kids  and all the kids burst out laughing.  Adam looked at them.

“You got an idea?” She blushed immediately as he asked. He recognized the shyness even if she was a Wossir. Some things are universal.

“She had a name for the Gas giant.” Her brother replied with a grin.

“Well, let's hear it?” Adam said, and without hesitation, the boy replied. “Onic!”

The students turned and looked at Adam and shook their heads in panic, and Vorst started to laugh. That decided it for Adam so he added the name to the gas giant.

“Eh, Sir? Do you know what Onic means?” [Kinita Sumina]() asked carefully, as the kids roared with laughter.

“No, but I guess it’s something the kids find funny.” He replied and Kinita looked at the kids and back at him.

“yes, it means fart. As in pass gas, but Onic means a stinky fart. Are you sure that’s a good name for such a planet?”

Adam looked at the kids and started to laugh. Vorts looked at the students. “Humans have a wired sense of humor. I think we should get the kids out before we name the rest, or all the names will be just as bad.” Then he got up and ordered the kids to the kitchen for ice cream. The bribe worked, and soon, there were only adults in the room—well, adults and Adam.

 They discussed the name, and after a while, they had a list. The moons would be named later of the planets would be named later, for now, they were moons of the planets they orbited. Adam looked at the list. He had written down what the names meant as well. At least he had done some work today if naming was work.

 

Sun – Doumu ( Chinese godess of the stars)

1. planet – Pele ( Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes and fire)

2. planet – Dirt

Asteroid field  ( Daren field – Field of the dead in Haran)

1 Gas Giant – Onic (Stinky Fart in Wossir language)

3. planet – Yamar ( God of the cold mountains in Tufon religion)

2. Gas Giant –  Hanori (Perfume in old Wossir)

Large Asteroid field (Xan-bo field (secret treasure in Ghorts))

He looked over the list one last time, then got up to leave as Mir-Na approached him. “Sir, as you know, we have made reports to the library, and when they heard Jork Wirk was here, then they asked for permission to visit and speak with you. Partly to see our works and perhaps buy him from you.”

Adam pinched the bridge of his nose. “ What did you tell them?”

“That we had to ask you first.” She replied, and Adam smiled slightly.

“Good. I want to talk to Jork about it first, and if he agrees, then we will pick them up.  We have to be a little careful now, as the last family we rescued might have gotten us into a dispute with some pirates. This reminds me, The oldest girl, Skee Laf, has a master's in Ocean biology, she might be of use to you guys as the lakes start to form.”

 Then he excused himself and went to find Jork; he didn’t like the idea of visiting professors; they tend to talk too much.",28,1728571919.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

TL;DR seemingly supernatural happenings

So TW right away, today's a trauma anniversary for me. It's the birthday of an ex-friend who assaulted me when we were 16

Being neurodivergent, I can't forget birthdays. It's been 12 years of CPTSD and nightmares and always having worsening symptoms around not only the date of the assault, but today as well. I'm in therapy, and have had therapy a few times over the years, but what sets apart this year I think is that I finally reported him a few months ago (post is still up on my profile for more details)

I woke up at 3am today, not even from a nightmare for once. Just suddenly awake, full of energy and rage

I'm not really a practicing witch. I've done a handful of spells in the past but most of my experience is hereditary/innate/instinctive. It's not something I choose to do, I just predict things sometimes and am sensitive to the paranormal all while usually trying to stay skeptical. I'm very mindful that my experiences could be psychological (hallucinations/paranoia, autistic pattern recognition), and any spells I have done (healing, banishing unwelcome spirits in a new home, safe birth/pregnancy spells) I try to view more like prayer or a mindfulness exercise to stay grounded given my psychiatric history

Anyway, I felt the urge to do some spellwork today. I won't lie, at first I did spend some time reading about hexes because I've zero familiarity with any of that side of witchcraft and I was mad as hell. But eventually I found an easier version of an unbinding spell I'd already been meaning to do for some time now. I'll try to find the source again but it wasn't an unbinding, more of a return to sender kind of deal

The original spell once the candle was prepared (black, carved with the target's name and anointed with olive oil) was to say a short phrase along the lines of ""Any intentions towards me I return to (name)"" then blow out the candle

Well, I read that out but it didn't feel good enough when he like most abusers of that kind don't see a problem with their behaviour and perhaps he never ""intended"" to do what he did. So before blowing out the candle, I repeated the phrase but changed ""intentions"" to ""harm he caused me"". I admit I also sprinkled in an angry ""Happy birthday, motherfucker"" in there right before angrily blowing it out 😅

Thing is I prefer to let candles burn or use a snuffer when doing spellwork. I suppose when I first started dabbling in practicing a few years ago, I read somewhere that blowing out the candle can negatively impact the spell and it's stuck with me. But I know that most witchcraft comes down to what feels right for *you*! It didn't quite sit right with me this time to snuff it out. I felt there'd be power in imitating the birthday candle ritual when this day seems to have chosen itself to be *the* day I finally cast a spell in relation to him. But it also didn't sit right to leave the candle intact, like the spell I read to inspire this one had instructed to blow it out immediately

So I had a coffee, relaxed for a bit, then re-lit the candle. I should note some other adaptations I made for the spell:

I opened my box of witchy stuff to get out a candle holder, chose the pentacle one (I have a bat and a cat, too)

Decided for some extra protection to get the quartz point crystal I was gifted by another witch

Went to close the box but it felt wrong, so I left it open so all my crystals could kind of boost/be there for me in the background

Turns out the box of black candles I bought all those months ago is actually labelled ""protection"". I'd originally bought a black beeswax candle for the unbinding, but it didn't fit the candle holders I had at home. I'm sure the purpose for that one will show itself when ready!

Since he has a common first and last name, I carved his date of birth on the candle, as well as "">!rapist!<"". I also chose to score down the length to separate his identity & crime from my intent, then carved between those lines ""free me from him""

I don't cook with oil so had no olive oil for anointing, but my fiancée stayed with me recently and turns out she left some rapeseed oil in my cupboard. I didn't even bother looking it up, it just felt fitting as hell, so I used it

The weird thing is that normally once I light a candle to burn out, I just kind of get on with watching TV or whatever and not pay it much attention once I've set my intention, but this time the flame drew me in. I watched it burn all the way down for 40 minutes (small candle with 1.5hr burn, yes it did burn very fast!), and it gets weirder

I don't even remember what I said but I was verbally praying/setting intentions that entire time and staring at the candle intently. The original phrase to start with, sure, but then just pouring it all out, almost like chanting. ""Protect me, protect all his victims, give them strength, this pain/anger/hate/blame/shame/burden/etc. isn't ours anymore, I send it back to him"" etc., etc., over and over again. There was part of me during this that drew parallels between the ritual and EMDR therapy

I noticed when the candle started melting, it was turning into shapes. The first shape was a woman arms outstretched seemingly wailing or screaming in agony. Then a woman crying in fetal position. That stayed the longest, until the wax eventually fell into a woman standing upright facing away from the candle. Then a woman sat holding a baby (I'm childfree but he does have a wife and young children and I was praying a lot for their safety). Then a woman standing arms folded at the top of the candle, seeming to watch the flame with curiosity. The candle then collapsed and it made the shape of a dragon (mostly a wing), which melted into an angel. The last dregs of the wax seemed to be a masculine arm with the fist nearly touching the wick, which started while I was saying stuff like ""let me go/let it go to him/let me let it go"" and ngl freaked me out more than the rest but also felt so freeing and right.

When the arm fell, I started thanking the presence(s) guiding me and supporting me through this, letting them know I could feel them and how grateful I am even though I can't see/name them, and a smaller version of the angel's wing reappeared during the last few minutes of the candle's life. I just stared at the flame shrinking to embers and this is I think the spookiest part for me, but the candle and holder, and my witch box, and bedside table (I don't have an altar) were radiating bright silver light. The candle and holder are black, and the rest of my decor is white, and it was just this brilliant white light coming from everything involved in the spell. I tried unfocusing/refocusing my eyes and it affected it a bit but it was still undeniably there, varying 2cm to 4cm of light depending on how focused my eyes were. It was also definitely not a trick of the sunlight, and the flame held eerily still for the duration of the spell until steadily shrinking at the very end as described. No smoke either

So yeah, slightly shaken by how powerful that experience was but feeling VERY at peace, and very sure it worked, whether the cause for that feeling be supernatural or therapeutic 😂",8,1728571918.0,WitchesVsPatriarchy,5,0.83,False

1g0ki8i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g0ki8i,1942 Silvertone 7010 rescued and restored,"Well this was a long one. I rescued this Silvertone from an antique store for $5 a while ago and finally got around to restoring it. I say rescued because this one was mangled and in bad shape. Both sides panels were busted out and the part of the frame holding the tuning assembly was bent up pretty bad. I think someone dropped it and the chassis fell out because the screws and knobs were missing (of course).Thank goodness the glass was intact. This is not really an exciting radio but I kind of took pity on it and it was cheap so I brought it home. I also discovered it had a blown rectifier tube and the filter cap has been oozing black goo for a while.

I did the typical stuff, replace the capacitors and bad resistors. Replaced the rectifier tube, installed a fuse, wired the power switch for the hot side and replaced the power cable. That got it working again but no way to tune it without moving the tuning condenser by hand. I found out the speaker cone had some tears so I fixed that with coffee filter paper and white glue.

My next task was bending the frame back and restringing the dial cord. It was smooshed pretty good but after a couple of long nights I finally got it as close as I can. It's not perfect but it's functional. At this point I was able to do a signal alignment and the dial scale actually matched up pretty close!

I started work on the cabinet next. Lucky for me, whoever dropped the radio put the broken pieces inside. I used super glue to hold the pieces in place and then JB Weld to reinforce the cracks on the inside of the cabinet. I think it turned out good all things considered!

Finally the antenna needed minor repair. Some of the wax lost it's hold on the antenna wiring. I used a tea candle to melt some wax on the needed areas. I'm curious to see how well this will hold up to the heat of the tubes but I think it will be fine.",2,1728571601.0,VintageRadios,1,1.0,False

Long time no post. I've had some stuff come up recently and am looking to offload a little bit of my collection to cover costs. Dental should definitely be a part of health insurance lol.

Anyway - Just about everything I am looking to sell is for the switch since that is where most of the value is...in my collection anyway. The prices below I /think/ are fair, if I am off base just let me know. I am alright with offers. Shipping is not included in the below prices (especially the CE's). I will be more inclined to do a deal on multiples.

I am working on pictures for a few of the things, the ones I took of the SRG games turned out awful because of reflections.

I wanted to share some results with a community that understands.

I was diagnosed with elevated testosterone when I was young, around 16 years old. The doctor told me that I would always struggle with my weight and that he doubt I would have children however he did not give me a diagnosis. Anyway fast forward, I joined the military and unfortunately had to get out due to injuries to my hips, and feet. These injuries caused me great pain which led to me turning to food for comfort. Since that time back in 2021 I have slowly been gaining weight, close to 100lbs.

Back in February I had to go into the VA for X-Rays of my hips. I didn't have a full mirror at home. When I checked in I turned around and saw my body for the first time in full length. I gasped and broke down. I couldn't believe what I had done to myself and how far I had let myself go. I knew I had to change and take things seriously. I reached out to my nutritionist and had a open and raw conversation with her. I had previously been diagnosed with an ED from her, but was in denial until that point. I took to heart what she said and also began to do research of my own. I joined a weight training class at my college, changed my diet reducing carbs (but carefully, I did not want to cause a binge episode), started taking proper supplements and really reduced my stress! We moved and since we have a bigger place we were able to get an elliptical as a low impact cardio machine. All of these minor changes have paid off! Here is what I did:

-30 minutes working out daily (really started implementing this in September when we got our Elliptical machine). I started slow only being able to do 15 minutes at the beginning and worked my way up!

-Low Carb, High Protein- Really focusing on clean, non processed foods. I am able to eat dairy (usually in my creamer or cheese). I have reduced my caffeine consumption to just one cup of coffee daily. I try to not go over 40 carbs per day, but I am not perfect and honestly I am going to enjoy having a date with my husband!

-Drink Tea at least 3 times a day- spearmint or mint mixture. This helps me stay on track with my daily water consumption too!

-Stay Hydrated.

-Taking my supplements (recommended by my nutritionist and OBGYN) to include Tumeric Curcumin X2 daily, CO Q10 X1, Vitamin D3 X1, Prenatal with Folic Acid and DHA (We are trying to get pregnant), and Fish/Crill Oil tablets X2 Daily.

-Taking my Ovasitol daily. I was using it twice daily at the beginning however since I have really managed my diet and exercise I have decreased it down to once daily as I was getting dizzy and my BG was dropping.

-Stress Management and Sleep! This is something that has been so important. I am taking time for myself and getting at least 7 hours per night. I am currently working nights so this has been very important for me! This also included quitting vaping.

Final Thoughts:

If you have made it this far awesome and thank you! Honestly consistency and small changes is going to show more results that just making abrupt changes. Change your mindset, this is a lifestyle change! I wanted to be healthy for my future pregnancy, lose weight so that I can start to run again, and have a healthy life with my husband. It is not a short term goal. I will always struggle with my ED but I have developed a positive relationship with food. Some weeks I didn't lose anything and then other weeks I lost three pounds. I feel better, and my mental health has improved greatly.

You can do this!

1g0k1bw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rotterdam/comments/1g0k1bw/how_to_getting_naturalisatie_appointment_in/,HOW TO - Getting naturalisatie appointment in Rotterdam,"Hello again,

I recently posted my experience getting an appointment with a python script. I promised I would post the code once my friend has gotten an appointment. I also have received a lot of messages asking for help so I will post my solution here. I will also leave a link at the end for you to buy me a coffee if you think I helped you in any way.

**Problem:**  
There seems to never be available dates for naturalization in RTD. After these week I also realized that the dates usually open in the morning for the same date and get taken in less that 5 min. Probably there is a company offering the service to other people and also some of us would know how to build a scrap bot because some of you did it before me and after me as well but it cant be that many.

**Solution:**

**1- Get Python installed:**

You can download Python from python.org. Make sure to add Python to your PATH during installation. Also get a code editor. If you are struggling with this part there are many guides on the internet to get python. Also if you struggle with this part I guess you are new to this so have patience there is a lot to learn but it is usually worth it when you make it.

**2- Install Telegram and create a bot:**

Install Telegram on your phone or PC and create an account. Search for BotFather in Telegram and follow instructions to create a bot. You’ll receive a token that you'll need for the bot to work. Second thing is to get your chat ID using userinfobot (search for it like Botfather) by sending the command /start.

Some notes: I believe BotFather is an offical bot from telegram but I think userinfobot is not (but at least 300k people seem to trust it). Be careful and use the exact names for the bots since anyone can create bots. Also my first bot got banned from telegram for some reason (I think because it was also sending messages my friends account as well) and i could get banned if I create another ""malicious bot"" so be careful and maybe only use your bot with yourself.

**3- Set up the Python script:**

**Install Required Libraries:**

Run the following command to install the required packages:

    pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 requests

**Download ChromeDriver:**

* You’ll need ChromeDriver for Selenium to control the Chrome browser.
* Download the version that matches your Chrome version and place the chromedriver.exe in C:/Windows/chromedriver/.

**Create and Run the Script:**

Open VS Code and create a new file, date\_checker.py.

Paste the following code into the file:

    from selenium import webdriver 
    from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By 
    from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait 
    from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

        # Properly encode the message text to be URL-safe

        for chat_id in chat_ids:
                send_text = f'https://api.telegram.org/bot{bot_token}/sendMessage?chat_id={chat_id}&text={encoded_message}'
                
                # Send message to each chat ID
                response = requests.get(send_text)
    
                if response.status_code == 200:

            date_info_list = []
    
            for date_button in available_dates:
                if date_button.get('disabled') is None:
                    location = date_button.find('h3').text.strip()
                    date_time = date_button.find('p').text.strip()
                    # Add each location and date/time to the list
                    date_info_list.append(f""{location}: {date_time}"")
    
            # Combine all date information into a single string with line breaks
            date_info = ""\n"".join(date_info_list)
    
            # Create the final message
            message = f""{message_first_part}\nAvailable at:\n{date_info}\nMessage Sent at: {current_time}""
            print(message)
    
            # Send the message via Telegram
            send_telegram_message(message)
        else:
            print(""No alert - No available dates found."")
    
            # Create the message indicating no available dates
            message = f""{message_first_part}\nNo available dates found.\nMessage Sent at: {current_time}""
            #send_telegram_message(message) # Comment this out if you dont want to get messages when there is no dates
    
    finally:
        # Close the WebDriver

Replace 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' with your bot token from BotFather.

Replace 'xxxxxxxxx' with your chat ID from IDBot.

**4- Test the code:**

After replacing the IDs you can take the # out of the last send\_telegran\_message so the code will send a message even if there are no dates. You can leave this part in so you know the code is working.

**5- Make it run in the background:**

To run the script automatically, you can use Task Scheduler on Windows or put everything on a simple loop code and leave your computer on the whole time.  
What I did was to create a bat file with the following code and put it on task scheduler every 5 minutes. I had to change some settings in my pc so it didnt stop the task scheduler when it went to sleep so I made it hibernate instead.

So as I said if you feel I helped you get an appointment you are free to buy me a coffee for my next trip to Slovenia!

“	Uh, guys? Maybe Teardrop did care, but just didn't say anything, because, ya' know, she CAN'T?	”
 	
— Barf Bag, ""Getting Teardrop to Talk""
Barf Bag is a female contestant in Battle for BFDI and Battle for Dream Island: The Power of Two.

In Battle for Dream Island, Barf Bag was one of the 30 recommended characters that had a chance to join the show in ""The Reveal"". The votes for the debut were revealed in ""Reveal Novum"" and she only got 3 votes which was not enough to join, placing her 27th to join the season.

In Battle for Dream Island Again, Barf Bag had the chance to join at the start of the season but she only received 78 votes which wasn't enough, placing 52nd to join the season and so she was sent to the Tiny Loser Chamber.

In IDFB, Barf Bag is currently in the Tiny Loser Chamber due to failing to debut in BFDIA. She had a chance to join the season but only received 293 votes[1] , which was not enough to rejoin and placed her 12th to join the season.

In Battle for BFDI, Barf Bag competed on Team Ice Cube! until the split in ""The Escape from Four"" where she left the show to compete on Two's show.

In Battle for Dream Island: The Power of Two, Barf Bag competed on Team8s until the team swap in ""What's Up Bell's String?"" where she was instead put on CloudYAY by One, where she competed until ""Category One"" where she was eliminated with 11,048 votes, placing 27th overall.

Personality
BFDIA
Despite not competing, Barf Bag has demonstrated a kind and rational nature, often showing more sympathy toward her fellow objects than some of the other characters. A clear example of this is in ""PointyPointyPointy ♫,"" where she was the only one concerned about Fanny being in pain. Barf Bag even volunteered to crank the LOL herself, despite the challenge's high difficulty, highlighting her selflessness and willingness to help others. It suggests that Barf Bag is not only considerate but also willing to take on hard tasks for the sake of her teammates, demonstrating a level of emotional intelligence and maturity that sets her apart from other competitors.

BFB
Barf Bag continues to be a friendly and caring person. She is seen to be caring for other contestants, as shown when she spared Teardrop in ""Lick Your Way to Freedom"" and is empathetic, showing that in that same episode she noticed that Bracelety missed Ice Cube. She appears to be very close with her teammates. She also shows concern for her fellow teammates and is rather selfless, as she tried to help iance get away from the lava in ""Don't Dig Straight Down"" and died doing so.

Despite her brain being placed in her vomit, Barf Bag also appears to be rather smart, as she used scientific proof to try to convince Lollipop that she isn’t stupid. However, it is unknown if her evidence was legitimate. Despite this, she has slow reflexes and/or a short memory, as seen in ""Questions Answered"" where she doesn't know the answer to ""what's snow + gasoline"".

However, despite her general kindness to others, Barf Bag gets easily upset when others, especially Lollipop, for assuming that she's stupid due to her brain being constantly doused in vomit. Due to this, she believes that no one else will take her seriously because a few people don't treat her with any respect. Her only conflicts in the entire series so far is towards people who think this way towards her as she wants to be respected. Barf Bag has also had her moments of mean-spiritedness; she has physically attacked the Announcer before and called out Bell for tying herself around her team's stack.

TPOT
Barf Bag can act sarcastic at times, such as in ""Getting Puffball To Think About Rollercoasters"" after she responded with a sarcastic laugh at Coiny's pun. She is also shown to be impulsive and somewhat childish in ""Fishes and Dishes"", as her ideas for the contest were to order a ""second moon"" and change the sign of The Slowest Train Ever to The Fastest Train Ever, refusing to change it back even after the rest of the team were screaming in fear.

This reveals Barf Bag's layered personality, combining traits of sarcasm, impulsiveness, and even a bit of childish behavior. These contrasting traits add complexity to her character, showing that while she can be caring and thoughtful, she is also prone to impulsive and rash decisions, sometimes disregarding the team's consensus.

Water Bag
Barfy 30
Barf Bag is concerned about the abnormally high heat levels.

In ""Don't Dig Straight Down"", as Water Bag, she is more energetic and childish, similar to Gelatin, though the hot spring water may not have affected her brain, just her personality. She still retains her intelligence, deducing correctly there was a volcano underneath the inverted planet her team was on at the time.

Tears Bag
In ""Balancing P.A.C.T"", Teardrop enters Barf Bag, empowering her while giving her some of Teardrop's personality. She feels wonderful, but she also feels reckless.

Zombified
If mixed with lava-infused vomit, as shown in ""Outbreak At Stake"", Barf Bag enters a zombified state. In this state, her entire person turns green and her eyes and mouth are diluted.

She is depicted as patient zero in the episode, the first object to have obtained this form.

Official Character Guide biography
Imagine having to carry around a bag of vomit 24/7. Barf Bag doesn't have to imagine. Barf Bag has a high opinion of herself, believing she is smart and often sensible.

Some people don't think that highly of Barf Bag, because they incorrectly believe the barf molecules pollute her brain, which makes her incredibly upset. After all, she answered a difficult quiz question for her team correctly!

Did You Know?: When Barf Bag feels like throwing up, she cannot use herself to collect her barf, because that would have no effect.

Abilities
Liquid Affecting Properties: When mixed with certain liquids, Barf Bag will gain many abilities.
Fire Breath: When mixed with gasoline and something flammable, she'll breathe out fire.
Enhanced Strength: When mixed with warm water, she'll get enhanced strength.
Zombification: When mixed with lava, Barf Bag will turn into a zombie.
Enhanced Stamina: When mixed with a protein shake, she'll have the energy to do exercises like push-ups for an extended amount of time.
Weaknesses
Content dependency: Having some liquid inside of her seems critical for brain function. Without it, she'll get woozy, and eventually pass out. (as confirmed in ""Don't Dig Straight Down"") Depending on the type of liquid in her, her personality will also change. This, however, can also be an ability as she gets stronger with Teardrop as her fluid.
Liquid Affecting Properties: When mixed with certain liquids, Barf Bag will gain many weaknesses.
Freezabillity: When mixed with Ice Cubes, She'll be completely frozen.
Sluggishness: When mixed with Warm Milk, She'll fall to sleep completely.

Battle for Dream Island
Barfbag
Barf Bag in Battle for Dream Island

Barf Bag was first recommended as Baggy. She, the contestants, and the other recommended characters except for Tennis Ball fell in the vat of hydrochloric acid trying to obtain Bally and Marble.

Barf Bag was first recommended as her current form in ""Vomitaco"". The challenges were represented by Barf Bag herself, and Taco. In particular, Pencil, Blocky, Bubble, Ice Cube, and Rocky chose the Barf Bag Contest.

She was recommended as Paper Bag in ""Bowling, Now with Explosions!"". She was part of the large crowd watching the Cake at Stake. She alongside the crowd was put in a box to keep them from seeing the Cake at Stake. During the episode's stinger, the box somehow manages to catch on fire, burning them all.

Barf Bag was handpicked out of the hundreds of recommended characters to join Season 1 in ""The Reveal"". Her audition tape is her sitting and accidentally breaking and spilling out vomit.

However, in ""Reveal Novum"", it is revealed she got 3 votes to join, so she, along with Naily, Tree, and Saw, was sent to the Locker of Losers, not before damaging the Announcer in one way or another.

Battle for Dream Island Again
In ""Yeah, Who? I Wanna Know,"" It was revealed that Barf Bag got 78 votes to join; she was once again treated with the Locker of Losers.

In ""Well, Look Who It Is!,"" Barf Bag makes her first speaking appearance in chronological order. She initially appears with her BFDI asset, but a stray laser from an Enhancement L-Yoy-Ser hits the LOL, giving her the current asset she uses from IDFB onward. Later, she sees the eliminated BFDIA contestants ordering islands and tries to place an order herself. However, Match, with a hint of sarcasm, tells her she's ""too far away"" for her to speak into the phone. When Barf Bag tells her to just hand over the phone, Match swiftly hangs up, claiming that it’s too late.

In ""PointyPointyPointy ♫"", Barf Bag saves Fanny from being used as a crank, opting to crank the Locker of Losers' helicopter rotors herself. She later excitedly announces the Cake at Stake results following the death of the previous hosts, who according to the Host Bug's phone was ""[the bugs'] next meal"". She is also revealed to be Fries' best friend. Later, all the objects locked in the Locker of Losers end up hosting the challenge due to the absence of a host.

In ""Spore Day"", the council of the Locker of Losers continue to host the show. She witnesses a drop of diluted lead turn into diluted gold and starts to sing ""Gold"" by Owl City.

IDFB
In ""Welcome Back,"" she is given a chance to join the game, along with the other characters in the TLC. Although the season is currently on hiatus, they ended up getting 293votes, placing 12th (to see spoiler texts, hover over it or highlight it with your cursor).[2]

Battle for BFDI
Maybe she did care
In ""Getting Teardrop to Talk"", her first speaking appearance, Barf Bag tries to correct Pillow with the fact that Teardrop can't talk. However, despite being correct, her correction was criticized by Pillow herself, and more prominently Lollipop, who says that the ""barf molecules"" inside Barf Bag's head causing her to be unintelligent. Eggy tries to correct Lollipop and defend Barf Bag, saying that it isn't Barf Bag's fault that her brain is infected.

Despite that, Barf Bag, now offended, flutters her arms, which Pillow interprets as a sign of Barf Bag not caring. Barf Bag becomes fast friends with Spongy, who takes her seriously and is relieved that there is finally someone who does so.

She appears later with Lollipop, telling her she can ""prove herself"" if she was on Lollipop's team. However, she is rejected, citing her assumed ""unintelligence"" as a reason, and forms a team with Spongy out of anger. She and Bracelety both use Spongy to help her team get their basket to X while Gelatin, not knowing they're doing so, suggests using Bomby to blow the basket to X.

In ""Lick Your Way to Freedom"", she helps her team lick Teardrop out of a jawbreaker. She spares and lets Teardrop go back to her team, and she shows empathy for a saddened Bracelety, who is expected to see Ice Cube. However, Firey Jr. says that Bracelety will ""get over it"".

Barf Bag in BFB 3
In ""Why Would You Do This on a Swingset"", she tries to explain to Lollipop how her barf doesn't make her dumber, but to no avail, as Lollipop tries to wiggle Barf Bag's arms instead, to make it seem as though Barf Bag doesn't care about their conversation. She, along with Gelatin and Spongy, later attempts to help her team spin their swing with her barf. However they lose the challenge as their swing was blown up with only three swings to go.

In ""Today's Very Special Episode"", she first appears as one of the objects who climbed Bell's string. She is the second safe in her team's first Cake at Stake at 711 votes. When catching her cake, Barf Bag spins, causing the vomit in her to fall out of her and land onto X and the remaining cakes, so the rest of her teammates but Donut (whose cake flew past his hole and was eaten by Bottle) and Bracelety (who was eliminated with a record amount of votes by the episode's release) got vomit-filled cake.

She is then zapped off of Bell's string by Lightning. During the challenge, she tells Four to see her team's creation, which they made out of what appears to be scraps of the recently-eliminated Bracelety's Ice Cube memorabilia. Her team is safe from elimination, for the creation was ""crafty, and good"".

While she doesn't have any lines in ""Fortunate Ben"", Barf Bag first appears to be angry at Gelatin for stealing Bracelety's signs and using them for the prize for Death P.A.C.T.'s Cake at Stake. However, she and the others are happy shortly after. She later appears on her team's paper airplane, and since her team didn't hit the ground, her team wins immunity.

Snapshot - 223
In ""Four Goes Too Far"", Barf Bag once again doesn't have any lines. She is only seen twice: looking worried at Donut injecting the Twinkle onto himself, and during the passing of the Twinkle to other objects. She was never infected with the Twinkle, and her team is safe, as no one on her team still had the Twinkle as the timer ran out. In fact, with Spongy being the last person on her team to recieve the Twinkle, her team finishes first.

In ""The Liar Ball You Don't Want"", she is first seen putting a rubber dome on Eggy's head. She is also briefly seen arguing among the contestants after Loser's elimination.

In ""Questions Answered"", she is first seen greeting Gelatin and does Four's intro pose.

Barfandlolly
""Shut it, LolliPOOP.""

During the challenge, Donut asks her why she hasn't answered for them even after he's tried to give her questions as easy as ""pieces of cake"". Barf Bag blames it on her reflexes, which are too slow. Lollipop chimes in and says her slow reflexes are caused by her ""barf molecules"", prompting Barf Bag to say ""Shut it, LolliPOOP!"" - showcasing their rivalry.

Question three is ""what is snow + gasoline"", which is glue, but Barf Bag does not know the answer. Donut then proceeds to ask her to recite what he said during his heroic speech, which only his teammates - including Barf Bag - heard. That was when she answered, and she answered correctly, so her team is safe.

In ""This Episode Is About Basketball"", she asks X to clarify what the ninth challenge was. She is also heard complaining when A Better Name Than That is safe, due to Blocky throwing Tennis Ball and Basketball onto his team's basket. When Gelatin suggests they use Bomby, presumably to explode the balls into the basket, Barf Bag glares at him. Gelatin then says they could use Bomby to throw balls. Donut is skeptical that that's what Gelatin wanted to say, so she tells him that he's taking a step in the right direction.

Barf Bag does not appear in ""Enter the Exit"" nor ""Get to the Top in 500 Steps"", but her team is safe in both episodes.

In ""What Do You Think of Roleplay?"" when Firey Jr. thinks Gelatin is fake because he hadn't used Bomby to win the challenge, Barf Bag says that he's stopped using Bomby since BFB 9. Barf Bag then proposes that Naily is fake due to her lack of nail puns recently, but she says she stopped because Firey Jr. told her it was annoying earlier on. Barf Bag seems displeased with him for this.

Barf Bag in TPOT 12
Shortly after, Firey Jr. thinks Donut is the fake because he hasn't been mean. Barf Bag asks what gave him the impression, to which Firey Jr. replies with the fact that he was eliminated first in BFDIA. Barf Bag defends him by saying he was standing by his principals. That's when Firey Jr. believes that Barf Bag is the fake. She tells him she's not fake and asks Spongy if he thought so too, which he agrees to. Naily then asks if Spongy is the fake due to him just sitting around, but Barf Bag says he always does that, once again to the agreement of Spongy. When Team Ice Cube! can't figure out the fake before all the other teams, they lose the challenge and are up for elimination. The faker was revealed to be Spongy, who was actually Tree. The real Spongy is upset about the team not finding him and asks if they know anything about him. Barf Bag tries to assure him that they do, but he isn't convinced.

In ""Return of the Rocket Ship"", Barf Bag is first seen with Spongy, who futilely tries to sail Paper Planes. Barf Bag says that while she does believe in him, they are running out of planes, she almost drowned, five times and have not even asked Four for permission to use the planes. She talks with Taco, who is grumpy because her team doesn't want to talk with her, and Barf Bag is the only one around. However, Barf Bag declines, stating that one of Taco's mutual friends is Lollipop, her arch-rival, and is busy hanging out with Spongy. Before Taco goes, Barf Bag tells her to start caring about her teammate's opinions of her, though she is unheard. Barf Bag suggests to Spongy that they play some table tennis, but Spongy refutes, saying he wants to play ping-pong.

Barf Bag is later seen at the episode's Cake at Stake. She gets souped by Four for being the first one safe, though the hot soup scalds her. When Firey Jr. is eliminated Barf Bag tells him that he wasn't really an asset to them as a team and that he should consider his 10,000 vote elimination as his first small victory. Barf Bag and her team, led by Gelatin, is later seen jumping in the hole iance made. They later land on Bubble, who iance thought had popped, but Bubble somehow manages to carry the entirety of Team Ice Cube!. (However, Flower would later fall onto Spongy, adding extra weight enough for Bubble to pop). Later, Team Ice Cube! starts to dig to the left, and eventually uncover something. Barf Bag states, ""Whoa... What is this place?""

Barf Bag in BFB 14
I... feel... AMAAAAZING.

In ""Don't Dig Straight Down"", the location Barf Bag has revealed is revealed to be a buried forest. She ends up having her body punctured by Naily, causing her to get woozy from a lack of barf. Donut has to patch her up and has Bomby dip her in (unknowingly warm) water. This makes her wake up, feeling very energized. She realizes the water inside her is warm (also the reason why she woke up energetic) and realizes how unnatural it is for lakes to be this warm, assuming the source of the heat is a Firey recovery center, or a volcano, which turns out to be accurate.

Barf Bag and Team Ice Cube! utilize Spongy's large friction to escape the buried forest that is now filling with lava, losing Donut in the process. When she makes it out of the hole, via Bomby's explosion, she hugs Gelatin and sarcastically thanks Spongy. She is one of the first objects to die when the lava spews towards the surface as she tries to warn iance of the incoming lava. As a result of her death, she loses all the spring water in her and regains her vomit.

Having not been recovered in ""The Four is Lava"", Barf Bag does not appear, though her team is up for elimination.

In ""The Escape from Four"", Barf Bag is recovered by Four, She is the first safe during her third Cake at Stake, and last in BFB; she gets specks of dust. She also helps with trying to pull the eliminated contestants out of Four. Amazed by Two's Limitless Power, she joins TPOT.

Barf Bag makes a small cameo in ""X Marks the Spot"" as part of a group that gasps when X is taken away by the Four Colored Team.

Barf Bag in TPOT 1
In ""You Know Those Buttons Don't Do Anything, Right?"", Barf Bag and Donut decide to be on the same team again. Gaty later asks Barf Bag if she wants to team up since they, along with Saw, are zigzags and Barf Bag accepts. They are named Team8s thanks to Saw still retaining the effects of 8-Ball's Fumes. After seeing Coiny use Pin to climb the building, Barf Bag follows his example by using Needle to do the same. Her team is the third one safe.

In ""The Worst Day of Black Hole's Life"", she initially helps the Team8s stack up the blocks but falls when Coiny suggests his new stacking idea (using glue). For the rest of the episode, she has a block inside of her. Barf Bag is intrigued by Coiny's idea and starts gluing and stacking blocks with Donut. The strategy proves to be useful as Barf Bag is able to push their tower back up when Eraser knocks it over. Later, Pin and Gaty attempt to stop them from cheating, but Barf Bag points out that what they're doing probably isn't against the rules since they didn't bring Two back with them. Later, Bell gets tangled around their stack, and Barf Bag tells her to get away from their stack. She ends up chasing Bell with her team when she starts carrying their stack in the air, trying to get it off her string. Needle eventually uses Saw to cut away the portion of the stack Bell was stuck on, unknowingly giving Tear Drop a stack. Her team ends up being safe from elimination due to having the tallest stack.

In ""Getting Puffball To Think About Rollercoasters"", she slips on her own barf and a block crushes her. She gets recovered after the intro. During the challenge, her team decides to build a restaurant as their attraction. Coiny suggests using her as food when it turns out the team has not sourced food yet. However, a stray laser shot from a Zap Ray vaporizes the attraction as a whole, leaving them and The S! up for elimination.

Barf Bag in Yoyleland

In ""Gardening Zero"", Barf Bag is the third contestant safe at Cake at Stake with 4,181 votes. For the challenge, Two assigns all of the team’s bracelets to help them reach their biome instantly. Barf Bag is skeptical about how that would work until she tries hers on and is teleported to Yoyleland. She is ecstatic to be there until she realizes that she’s by herself and isn’t sure how to get back. In a panic, she accidentally shakes her bracelet off and arrives back with the others. Golf Ball clarifies that she only needs to take the bracelet off to return.

She and her team are all sent to Yoyleland, which has a sufficient amount of requirements to naturally nurture a Funny Plant. Barf Bag says that the location is one of the places she yearned to travel to and knows the collectors' value of a Yoyleberry. After the challenge, a stray gamma ray from a quasar caused by Rocky's vomit being a lens vaporizes the plant whole.

In ""Fishes and Dishes"", Barf Bag is first seen pouring her vomit on a funny plant, along with Rocky. During the challenge, Barf Bag tells Coiny to order another moon. Coiny accidentally orders the magnet they need to Yellow Face's Warehouse, so the team has to board a train to get there quickly. After a trip on the world's slowest train ever, which Barf Bag turns into the world's fastest train ever, they arrive at the warehouse and pick up the world's strongest magnet. Needle helps with getting the team back to the competition by using the magnet to pull the train. Just as Eraser goes over to Two to give them a plate, Coiny snatches it away with the magnet at just the nick of time to save the Team8s from the chopping block.

Barf Bag in TPOT 6
In The Great Goikian Bake-Off, Barf Bag attempts to make a trade with Four, saying that she would give Four barf for his food. Four ends up crushing her. Later in the episode, Barf Bag gets recovered by Two. During the challenge, Barf Bag is seen making plans with Gaty and Needle. Team8s comes up with the idea of making Two a sandwich, so Barf Bag tells the team to make some traps to capture Two. She pours her barf on the ground, likely to make Two slip, but Two calmly levitates her barf back inside her. After hours of waiting, she gets impatient as Two still hasn't fallen into their leaf trap. But Bottle falls for it instead. The team decides to just use the prop bread that Coiny was wearing. They are given a 10/10 for their Two sandwich, making them safe. In the stinger, Barf Bag is mutilated by Four when she tries stealing their food.

In ""The Seven Wonders of Goiky"", Barf Bag and her team is tasked with the restoration of the Balance Beam. Pin and Coiny are immediately on the initiative, but Coiny gets distracted. Soon, the two tug on the mirror and end up making it big enough to cover the entire beam, making it appear like the beam was indeed untouched after all. However, the mirror soon breaks, so Barf Bag proposes that Donut be the glue. They are also aided with some wires that Just Not traded. Donut is flung into the path of both halves of the beam, crushing and killing him immediately. Once Two is called in to test the beam, they end up enjoying it so much; the team is safe.

In ""Balancing P.A.C.T."", Barf Bag is now on said balance beam. Teardrop hops into her, giving her a boost of strength - the others suggest she throws Pin, but she overshoots and Pin is sent across Goiky. Later on, Teardrop decides to hide inside Barf Bag as Eraser interrogates her for Teardrop's location, given the latter is in a one-girl band, Teardrop losing would mean automatic elimination, and the fact that Eraser had a rivalry with her. Snowball, deciding to take matters into his own hands, knocks Barf Bag clean off the balance beam, which has the side-effect of not only removing all of Barf Bag's barf, but revealing Teardrop's location (but thankfully, she's spared). Fanny's mouth ends up hitting Donut, who falls and gives the Team8s another elimination.

Barf bag in TPOT 9
In ""Outbreak At Stake"", the effects of Barf Bag losing her barf and indirectly Rocky's elimination in the previous episode are explored. As the only source of barf in all of Goiky now is infused with lava, and the only other way to give Barf Bag her barf back is to kill and recover her, Black Hole - not keen on the idea of killing another contestant - suggests the usage of the volcano-infused lava, which immediately has an adverse effect on her. Now patient zero, Barf Bag bites Pen. Throughout the episode, she is seen in this state, until an all-pure, all-clean Teardrop falls right into Barf Bag, purifying and recovering her. As the volcanic barf is the root cause of the zombie outbreak, and that the only source of pure barf now is the combination of Teardrop with Barf Bag's barf, Teardrop takes the shot for everyone and willingly sacrifices herself to make the cure, resulting in her elimination.

In ""Oneirophobe's Nightmare"", Barf Bag deals with the fallout of being patient zero in the previous episode, which was indirectly caused by Black Hole's fear of death, and soon afterward is placed into a deep sleep while her teammates try to wake her up. Her teammates try numerous different types of liquid, including lava, which affect her actions (so it makes her look like she is sleep-walking). She encounters an awakened Robot Flower, who threatens to destroy Basketball's aboveground factory so her team cannot restore her to an older version. Pin, pouring numerous amounts of caffeine into Barf Bag's barf, gets her teammate to act hyperactive, which happens to coincide with Bell and Snowball knocking Robot Flower off the roof of the hotel. The Team8s end up safe, but end up crashing into Robot Flower.

After her first recovery, she expresses her fear that everyone would be scared of her, but her team reassures her they'll always be by their side. Pin proceeds to hug Barf Bag a bit too tightly, killing her once more.

In ""What's Up Bell's String?"", Barf Bag faces a team swap, placing her in a new team dubbed CloudYAY by Two and new teammate Yellow Face. She shows distrust in Golf Ball's leadership, and decides to confide in Donut. Meanwhile, Golf Ball decides to enter the ad dimension to buy a lot of products from Yellow Face's store to help her team, but Pin and Gaty nab the stack, leaving CloudYAY with nothing once more. Barf Bag gets into a fight with Pen and Needle, but is killed when the Moon squishes her. A huge David stolen from Davidland remains their saving grace, but he decides to leave CloudYAY with nothing. Due to this, Barf Bag is up for elimination.

In ""Category One"", she and Donut attempt to block the door to the hotel as a hard-hitting hurricane ravages the hotel. The two of them are taken to Cake at Stake. Barf Bag is eliminated with 11,048 votes, and Pencil joins CloudYAY in her place. Barf Bag and Needle (who was also eliminated), end up disappearing into the mist; their whereabouts are not known.",1,1728570234.0,BattleForDreamIsland,0,1.0,False

These bite-sized treats feature rich, velvety chocolate mousse served in an edible chocolate cup, creating a beautiful and delicious dessert that’s ideal for any special occasion. Whether you’re hosting a dinner party, celebrating a holiday, or simply craving a chocolatey indulgence, these mousse cups are sure to impress.

In this article, we’ll guide you through the steps to make these delightful chocolate mousse cups, along with some tips to make them look as good as they taste.

**Why You’ll Love Chocolate Mousse Cups**

Chocolate Mousse Cups offer the best of both worlds — a silky smooth mousse paired with a crisp chocolate shell. The mousse is light and airy yet deeply chocolatey, while the chocolate cup adds a satisfying crunch with every bite. The presentation is stunning, making these cups a great choice for special occasions or even as a romantic dessert for two. Plus, they’re surprisingly easy to make, so you can whip them up whenever you’re in the mood for something indulgent.

**Ingredients for Chocolate Mousse Cups**

Here’s what you’ll need to make these elegant chocolate mousse cups:

**For the Chocolate Cups:**

* **8 oz semi-sweet or dark chocolate** (melted)
* **Silicone cupcake liners or chocolate molds**

**For the Chocolate Mousse:**

* **1 cup heavy whipping cream**
* **4 oz semi-sweet or dark chocolate** (chopped)
* **2 tablespoons powdered sugar**
* **1 teaspoon vanilla extract**

**For Garnish (optional):**

* **Whipped cream**
* **Chocolate shavings**
* **Fresh berries** (like raspberries or strawberries)

**Step-by-Step Recipe for Chocolate Mousse Cups**

**Step 1: Make the Chocolate Cups**

1. Melt the semi-sweet or dark chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring every 30 seconds until smooth.
2. Using a spoon or a pastry brush, coat the inside of silicone cupcake liners or chocolate molds with a thick layer of melted chocolate.
3. Place the chocolate-coated molds in the refrigerator for about 10–15 minutes to allow the chocolate to set. For an even thicker shell, repeat the process by adding a second layer of chocolate once the first layer has set.

**Step 2: Prepare the Chocolate Mousse**

1. In a saucepan, heat the heavy whipping cream over medium heat until it begins to simmer (do not let it boil).
2. Remove the saucepan from heat and add the chopped chocolate to the hot cream. Stir until the chocolate is fully melted and the mixture is smooth. Let it cool to room temperature.
3. In a separate bowl, whip the remaining heavy cream with the powdered sugar and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.
4. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cooled chocolate mixture until fully combined, creating a light and fluffy mousse.

**Step 3: Assemble the Mousse Cups**

1. Carefully remove the chocolate cups from their molds.
2. Spoon or pipe the chocolate mousse into each cup, filling them generously.
3. Garnish with a swirl of whipped cream, chocolate shavings, or fresh berries, if desired.
4. Refrigerate the assembled mousse cups for at least 1 hour to allow the mousse to set.

**Tips for Making the Best Chocolate Mousse Cups**

1. **Use high-quality chocolate:** The flavor of your mousse cups depends on the quality of the chocolate, so opt for good-quality semi-sweet or dark chocolate.
2. **Chill your mixing bowl:** To help the heavy cream whip up faster and fluffier, chill your mixing bowl and beaters in the freezer for about 10 minutes before whipping.
3. **Easy removal:** If using silicone molds, the chocolate cups will be easier to remove. Gently peel away the mold to keep the chocolate cups intact.
4. **Make ahead:** These mousse cups can be made a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator, making them perfect for entertaining.

**Why This Recipe Works**

The combination of whipped cream and melted chocolate creates a mousse that’s light, airy, and intensely chocolatey. Folding the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture gives the mousse its signature fluffy texture. The chocolate cups not only serve as an elegant presentation but also add a layer of rich chocolate flavor that complements the mousse beautifully. This dessert is both simple to make and impressive to serve.

**Serving Suggestions for Chocolate Mousse Cups**

* **For special occasions:** Serve these mousse cups as a sophisticated dessert at dinner parties, holiday gatherings, or romantic dinners.
* **With coffee or wine:** Pair with a cup of espresso or a glass of red wine for a delightful end to any meal.
* **Personalized toppings:**ﾠCustomize each cup with your favorite garnishes, like chopped nuts, caramel drizzle, or edible gold leaf, for a truly unique touch.

**Conclusion**

**Chocolate Mousse Cups** are the ultimate treat for anyone who loves the combination of creamy mousse and rich chocolate. With their elegant presentation and indulgent taste, they’re perfect for impressing guests or enjoying a special moment with someone you love. Easy to make and even easier to enjoy, these mousse cups are sure to become a go-to dessert in your recipe collection.",1,1728569779.0,u_Zdigitalkeys,0,1.0,False

Still no full or partial requests, though I've only been querying for a couple months. Any thoughts you might have on the query or the writing itself are welcome and appreciated!

Dear Agent,

THE WISH-FULFILLING GEM is an upmarket thriller, complete at 68,000 words. This story, set in the near future, blends the family-focused speculative elements of Richard Powers' ""Bewilderment"" with the investigatory spirit of Bernardo Bertolucci's ""Little Buddha"".

Penelope Culvert, an immigration attorney from Washington D.C., anticipates an uneventful two weeks before her forced resignation. So she is surprised, one morning, to find three Buddhist monks pressed into her office, eager for an audience. Today marks the fifth anniversary of the death of the Dalai Lama. The Buddhist leader had long maintained that, unlike his predecessors, his soul would not reincarnate into a successor. The monks, however, have come to suggest otherwise. They claim that the reincarnated soul of the Dalai Lama now resides in a five-year-old Panamanian girl currently being detained by I.C.E. in Texas. They need Penelope to help secure the girl's release and locate her politically dissident parents, in the hopes of winning them to their cause.

Penelope, herself a former Buddhist, wants to take these monks seriously and help them however she can. After all, they were a referral from her estranged mother. Penelope would do just about anything to mend their broken relationship. However, her contacts at I.C.E. take exception at bending the rules. And to make matters worse, the partners at Penelope's law firm have threatened her with litigation and disbarment, disinclined as they are to upset their wealthy and powerful Chinese clientele. Accompanying the monks to Texas, Penelope will balance her personal convictions with her professional obligations, all while navigating interference from both American and Chinese intelligence agencies, eager as they are to control the future of Tibetan Buddhism.

First 300:

Penelope Culvert found the office in upheaval. It was as if a revolution had stormed through an opened door, leaving in its wake a scatter of paperwork and stationary atop a host of upended workstations. She saw blood on the carpet. This office—once a model of sterile harmony—now seemed to quiver in the wake of some wandering disaster which had left as quickly and unaccountably as it had come. Violence, Penelope knew, was inevitable in spaces designed to temper our animal passions. Anger Management was no exception.

Penelope heard crackling behind a nearby filing cabinet. “No,” a man whispered.

“Elihu?”

A head materialized from around the cabinet, a rawboned little man pushing seventy. “Oh Penny, look what they’ve done,” he said, gesturing to the havocked landscape, what he had once tenderly described as his second home. At his feet a water jug sat severed from its cooler, where it had been used to smash several particleboard dividers.

“Elihu. What happened here?”

“Oh, Mr. Martinovich and Mr. Dunn got into it, I’m afraid.”

“Again?” Penelope asked. Elihu nodded his head, threatening tears. “Where are they now?”

“They took it outside. Last I saw, Mr. Martinovich was giving chase behind the generators. Doctors Horton and Bell hot on their heels. I called the police.”

“How long?” Penelope examined two large pieces of a broken coffee mug. Rejoining them, they spelled the opening of her therapist’s favorite tagline. ‘If the ocean can calm itself, so can you.’ The remaining fragments, along with the second half of its aphorism, stippled the short bristle carpeting like shells on a beach. She knew the rest by heart.
