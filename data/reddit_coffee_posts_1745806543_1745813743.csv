*All quotations and characters names from* [*Internet Archive Maude*](https://archive.org/details/anna-karenina-tolstoy-leo-graf-1828-1910/page/339/mode/1up).

Summary courtesy u/Honest_Ad_2157: Anna has told Karenin, but not told Vronsky that she told Karenin, even though she saw Vronsky that night. It‚Äôs now the morning after, and she‚Äôs got a shame hangover from what she has done and what she has failed to do. Annushka brings her clothing and a note from PB requesting Anna‚Äôs presence at croquet. Anna is listless and depressed. ‚Äò*I want nothing, nothing at all.*‚Äô Annushka announces coffee is ready and that Mariette expects her because Serezha has been naughty, eating a forbidden üçë.‚Ä† The mention of Serezha is like a hangover tonic, invigorating Anna. She is determined to leave with him. She confuses Mariette by being kind and dismissing her to talk to Serezha alone. She confuses Serezha by not punishing him and asking if he loves her. She then tells him to go to Mariette and walks out on the verandah in the post-thunderstorm cold, aspens shivering in the wind. The dose of indifferent nature reminds her of pitiless Society. She resolves to go to Moscow with just Annushka and Serezha, writing a letter to Karenin requesting custody of her son, omitting a reference to generosity in her final draft. She writes a one-line letter to Vronsky, ‚Äò*I have informed my husband*,‚Äô and tears it up.

‚Ä† Note that Stiva was bringing Dolly a giant üçêin 1.2 when she discovered the note. Genesis 3:6-12 recounts the story of original sin, the eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

**Characters**

*Involved in action*

* Anna Karenina, last seen headed home with Karenin in 2.29 >!or perhaps in a carriage with Kitty headed to Ergushevo in 3.12!<

* Serg√©y Alex√©yich Karenin, Sergei, Ser√©zha, Kutik, Seryozha, Anna‚Äôs 8-year-old son, last seen in 2.27 meeting his father at the dacha before the race, last mentioned prior chapter

*Mentioned or introduced*

Please see the [in-development character index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FbGn60f8tRX_xC2d87RFjDuAR3p0lZCjEyxDDCepCSw/edit?usp=sharing), a tab in the [reading schedule document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FbGn60f8tRX_xC2d87RFjDuAR3p0lZCjEyxDDCepCSw/edit?usp=sharing), which has each character‚Äôs names, first mentions, introductions, subsequent mentions, and significant relationships.

**Prompts**

1. In 2.8, we have the Very Long Night of Alexis Karenin, where he suffers alone. Here, we have Anna‚Äôs Morning After, where she tries to suffer alone. What are the differences in how they face up to what they have done and what they have failed to do? What kinds of actions and thoughts do the characters ascribe to others? Are they seeing clearly?
2. What are the similarities and differences between Anna's and Dolly's situations? What role do the children play? Why doesn‚Äôt Tolstoy choose to have them play that role with the men?

## What counts as a dupe?

* A perfume that smells ""just like"" another perfume - whether discontinued or priced out of budget

  * Example: ""looking for a dupe of BR540 Extrait, but without the price tag""

  * Example: ""something that smells ***just like*** Coffee Break, but lasts longer""

  * Example: ‚Äúa dupe for the discontinued Elizabeth & James Nirvana Black‚Äù

 * A perfume version of **any product**: body sprays, hair products, lotions / creams, skin care, candles, candy / sweets, makeup, etc.


## How it works:

Share as many details as possible that might be helpful in identifying the dupe you're after: a picture, notes or scent profile, your general geographic location, budget, etc. Please do a quick search of the sub before adding your request, even if you think it would be unusual.

Please remember that this is a global sub with quite a bit of volume, so a response may take time. This thread refreshes weekly on Mondays at 05:00 UTC, so keep that in mind when posting.

*If you're looking for perfumes with a similar vibe of another perfume, but not dupes, you can post directly to the main feed.*",1,1745812946.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

The house, which is fully walled, has 2 side corridors and a kitchen outside(all in stone floors), and in the wall, close to the kitchen, there's a door to a large area which is also enclosed but is purely undergrowth & dirt, no large trees and even has some sand;

About 2 years ago, some baby cats showed up in this enclosure, time skip and 2 of them stayed- for some reason they decided to do their brown duties in one of the corridors, even tho they sleep & eat in the kitchen that's not far from it, and that was bad enough, this left-side corridor doesnt lead to any open windows but we'd still have to clean it all with a chunk of cardboard, since it's all stone;

2 years later and now 3 extra cats have shown up from the undergrowth area, grown enough to come eat and sleep at the kitchen(we feed all of them), and for our own personal hell, all decided to turn the other corridor into a bathroom, which has destroyed the smell of the rooms with open windows to that side(the office suffering the most) and even the entrance to the house.

At this point, after having tried a few different things, like spreading camphor balls around(they'd just poop a little further away from it) or coffee powder(no effect), the family is considering putting down most of them, which i'm trying to avoid.

I dont understand why they'd choose the corridors they pass through daily rather than a large zone that still has sand; i'd guess it's because we've had dogs there in the past but that was more than 5-6 years ago.

This also doesnt include other nuissances, such as marking territory everywhere around the kitchen, under the cars, one time atop the car's front panel(ruined the AC for weeks), many times over the dishes on drying racks, and these odd times where one'd absolutely fill frying pans with urine, so much so that they're now kept covered in aluminum foil.

Only one of the cats is comfortable with being grabbed, moved around or pet in general, the other 4 would end up being taken out, including 2 barely past 1 month old.

I told him I have huge anxiety about weight gain after multiple IVF cycles caused some. Plus, my 1st trimester I had a previa that caused some bleeding and I was told to stop all workouts (even brisk walks would cause blood clots). 

Due to the IVF and bed rest weight gain, I avoid looking at the scale at appointments because even 1-2 lbs will make me feel like a failure.

He (an old guy) then tells me, I should slow down on the pregnancy weight gain because I‚Äôll be uncomfortable if I gain 40-50lbs. 
I haven't stopped crying thinking I've gained too much already if he's saying that at 17 weeks.  üò¢

It‚Äôs wild because I usually skip breakfast (mushroom coffee only) and eat 2 meals a day. I was intermittent fasting prior to pregnancy and I still don't get that hungry. I drink my water. And started back walking on my indoor treadmill now that the 2nd trimester energy kicked in and the placenta previa has moved up. 

But now, I‚Äôm wondering if I should just do one meal a day and 2 protein shakes as meals going forward. He made me feel fat and it makes me cry a lot now.

1k9mkp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1k9mkp1/is_there_really_only_one_objectively_correct/,Is there really only one ‚Äúobjectively correct‚Äù choice in every situation?,"Hi everyone, I know almost nothing about philosophy, but I‚Äôve run into a family issue that seems to have a philosophical root, and I could really use some help.

My husband strongly believes that there is always one single, objective truth. For example, he says that something like the trolley problem isn‚Äôt really a moral dilemma, it‚Äôs just a case of incomplete information. If we knew everything, there would be only one correct choice. He explained it like this: ‚ÄúA stone is gray. No matter how many people say it‚Äôs red, that doesn‚Äôt make it red. There‚Äôs only one objective truth.‚Äù

The problem is, this way of thinking leaks into everyday life. For instance, I love having coffee and a small piece of candy for breakfast - it‚Äôs my little ritual, it makes me happy, and I don‚Äôt want to give it up. But in his view, since eating candy is objectively bad for my health, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúwrong‚Äù choice, and by doing it, I‚Äôm denying reality and harming myself.

I tried to argue that even if I knew a piece of candy would take a year off my life, I could still consciously choose it, and that would be my right decision based on what I value. But he seems to think that anything that‚Äôs ‚Äúless healthy‚Äù is automatically wrong, no matter how I feel about it.

My question is:
Who gets to define what makes a choice ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù? Why should ‚Äúliving as long as possible‚Äù always be the ultimate goal? Is it philosophically valid to knowingly choose something harmful because it brings you joy?

Please help me save my morning ritual! Thank you so much

1k9mkik,https://www.reddit.com/r/petfoodfacts/comments/1k9mkik/forbidden_foods_for_furry_friends_what_not_to/,Forbidden Foods for Furry Friends: What Not to Feed Your Pets,"As loving pet parents, we‚Äôre always tempted to share our snacks and meals with our furry companions. However, not everything we enjoy is safe for them. In fact, some human foods can be dangerous, even life-threatening, for pets. Understanding which items belong on the forbidden pet food list is essential for keeping your cats and dogs healthy and happy.

In this guide, we‚Äôll highlight common foods to avoid, explain the risks, and offer safe pet food alternatives to keep your companions satisfied.

# Common Forbidden Foods for Pets

**Chocolate**

* Chocolate contains theobromine and caffeine, which are toxic to both cats and dogs. Even small amounts can cause vomiting, rapid heartbeat, tremors, or seizures.

**Onions, Garlic, and Chives**

* These kitchen staples can cause serious damage to a pet‚Äôs red blood cells, leading to anaemia. Whether raw, cooked, or powdered, they should never be part of your pet‚Äôs diet.

**Grapes and Raisins**

* Even a small number of grapes or raisins can lead to sudden kidney failure in dogs. Cats, while less tempted by them, are also at risk.

**Raw Meat, Eggs, and Fish**

While raw diets are popular in some circles, uncooked animal products may contain harmful bacteria like Salmonella or E. coli. Stick with specially formulated raw pet food options from trusted brands if you‚Äôre interested in this feeding style.

**Caffeine**

Tea, coffee, energy drinks, and certain sodas contain caffeine, which can be fatal to pets. Keep all caffeinated beverages well out of reach.

**Avocado**

Avocado contains persin, which can cause stomach upset in dogs and cats, and is particularly dangerous for birds and small mammals.

**Artificial Sweeteners (Xylitol)**

Found in sugar-free gum, sweets, and some peanut butters, xylitol can cause insulin spikes, leading to dangerous drops in blood sugar, seizures, or even liver failure in dogs.

**Alcohol**

Even small sips of alcoholic beverages can lead to vomiting, diarrhoea, difficulty breathing, and tremors in pets. Never allow your furry friend to taste beer, wine, or spirits.

# Safer Alternatives: Healthy Pet Food Options

Instead of offering risky table scraps, opt for nutritious and pet-safe treats. Modern [**pet food**](https://www.vetsupply.com.au/pet-foods/t200.aspx?utm_source=seo&utm_medium=organic) options are designed to meet your pet‚Äôs dietary needs without compromising on taste.

* Fresh veggies like carrots, green beans, and pumpkin (in moderation)
* Cooked, plain chicken or turkey
* Small pieces of apple (no seeds)
* Commercially prepared, vet-approved pet food and treats

**Final Thoughts**

It‚Äôs natural to want to share with our pets, but keeping harmful items off their menu is one of the most loving things you can do. Stick to safe, balanced pet food choices and consult your vet if you‚Äôre ever unsure about what‚Äôs suitable for your furry friend.

**Related FAQs**

Q1. Can I give my pet cooked bones?

A: No. Cooked bones can splinter and cause choking or internal injuries. Always opt for vet-approved pet food chews or raw bones designed for pets.

Q2. What should I do if my pet eats something toxic?

A: Contact your veterinarian or local emergency animal hospital immediately. Provide details of what was consumed and how much.

Q3. Are all human foods bad for pets?

A: Not at all. Some fruits and vegetables are safe in moderation. It‚Äôs always best to check with your vet or refer to trusted pet food safety guides before sharing.",1,1745812510.0,petfoodfacts,0,1.0,False

Because not everyone will buy food/drinks at the cafe or from the farm store. Some people will only come by to pet the cows and let their kids run around. How does that make them any money?

Who will be working there? I can see in the comments of her reel people are already offering their services for free in exchange for accommodation and I am sure she will take advantage of these people.

She says the idea is to create community and to gather together. so does it mean that she will be there at all times during opening hours? because her following is mostly made up of fangirl Americans. imagine flying halfway across the world to Sweden, driving to her farm outside of sigtuna and then she‚Äôs not even there!! How is this going to work?

We all know who will be making the coffees - Dennis! He will be behind stuck behind the machine and probably running the caf√©.

At the foundation, this business is funded by daddy casino because the land that they are using is his, so essentially this just feels like another ‚Äúlemonade stand‚Äù kind of venture for his 30 year old unemployed children to tinker around with and to keep them busy until the novelty wears out and this idea goes to die on her ever-growing cemetery of failed and forgotten projects.

Here are apps that I use

- McDonald‚Äôs : generous rewards and points. Good deals. ($5 off when you buy $20. Free fries etc)

- Panda Express: they often have deals in the app. 

- Starbucks : I only get iced coffee (less than $4). Don‚Äôt forget to bring personal cup. (Doesn‚Äôt have to be starbucks cup. ANY cup works). They give 10 cents off and give extra 25 stars. Which added up quickly. (100 stars = free iced coffee. 200 stars. Free ‚Äúfancy‚Äù drinks.)

- Chipotle : not that generous but my kids love Chipotle. So whenever I go Chipotle, scan app to get points. You can get free burrito with that points 2-3 times per year. 

- Instacart. - once in a while, it gives $40 off when u buy $80 groceries. I use it for walmart because it offer ‚Äúsame price‚Äù as in-store purchases.

1k9mgrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1k9mgrr/aitah_for_not_hearing_my_friends_side_of_the/,AITAH For not hearing my friends side of the story after i ended our 25year friendship???,"I'm sorry if this is going to be a long story but I feel that shortening it will leave out alot and I wanted people to hear the whole story.
Mind you this is the first time talking about the whole thing. I'm a closed off private person so this is hard for me.
I 33yr female have been a big time watcher of the YouTuber Charlotte Dobre, (My kids and I love her).... And I feel like I wanted to vent my issues and ask if what I did was wrong and accept whatever judgement is bestowed upon me. So Judge Charlotte grab your tea cup.... and tell me your honest conviction. (All names have been changed for privacy reasons)

So back story.... I 33yr female had been long time best friend with CiCi since we were 7 years old. Primary school days. We were never in the same class but we would spend every lunch time together and if on weekends if I wasn't at my grandparents place I was at hers sleeping over playdays and what not. You can say we had a bond like sisters. Even her parents accepted me as another daughter, CiCi and her family are Hungarians and Slavic and she came over to Australia when she was 6 so I was basically the first real friend she made besides her cousin and her older brother. 

Throughout our childhood and adult years we were always there for each other highs and lows at each kids birthday parties, watching our kids grow up together. Every heartbreak and tears we were there. She was closer to me than my own family. When ever she would call I'd drop everything no matter what I was doing and rush to hers, emergency or not. 
See through out my whole life I've always been a really big girl never under the 90kg mark since I was 13yrs old and CiCi was always the really thin girl with beautiful curly hair and big boobs, even after having her girls she never lost her figure. the type of girl all men like to be with. And she has only 3 female friends but mostly male friends and every male friend she dose have she's slept with more than once. (Keep this in mind for later)

Even when I left my abusive controlling partner and father of my daughter of 11years (tom) that CiCi never approved of cause she saw things that no one else saw. She was supportive of me and stood by no matter what decision I made. She was the only one that believed what horrors I was in but no one else did because he was extremely good at lieing and wearing a mask.

After leaving him in feb 2022 to march 2024 I lost just over 80kg in weight got a good steady job and my own place I met a nice guy, who we will call Stan, we met through a mutual friend called Ned at a karaoke bar that i known for years. Stan also came from the same country as my best friend and he was treating me decently. He knew all about me my insecurities about my weight and how much I have lost. He was incredibly proud of how far I've come. He knew about exs leaving me for skinnier girls cause they were bored of me. He assured me he was never like that and they didn't know what a good thing they had till it was gone. I felt so happy and in love. 
 We were steady for about 2months stan and I were incredibly happy and in love.
In the middle of May 2024 then I got a call from my best friend CiCi,
Crying in tears cause her partner and her were ending things and he is taking her to court for full custody of there 2 girls they had together and told me some pretty horrible things that did not make scene to his character, we will call her partner AJ.
AJ, CiCi and myself all went to the same high school. He seemed like a chilled played back guy who had some old school ways of thinking in relationships and love. He was always hung up on CiCi and briefly dated in high school but she was the one who always ""adventure out"" but would always end relationships before doing so. So I never had a problem with that I just don't agree to cheating or breaking the bro code like dating friends ex bf or their family members. 
But after every breakup she would always play the victim and over dramatise the situation... (remember this key point)

I do remember AJ and CiCi always fighting more often after her 3rd child/ his second was born (she had her eldest to a previous relationship) and he accepted her first born as his own and he was an amazing step dad to her eldest. She would even call me all hours even on days I had work to help her and listen to both talk out their issues and help resolve their fights. Mind you she was the only one screaming yelling he always kept calm and talk and everything he would say would anger her more. I always saw both sides and calmed her down and speak to both of them and offer wisdom on how they can resolve their issues.

Anyway when she called telling me the news she asked if I could come over, I said stan and I are getting ready to go out with a few of his work friends and CiCi asked if she could join. 
I asked Stan if that would be ok and he said that would be fine since I'm meeting all his work friends for the first time and would be happy to meet my best friend for the first time.
Stan and I rocked up and I met all his friends and they seemed nice going fellas we had a few drinks and things were going well. Then CiCi rocked up and I introduced her to everyone and from then on stan and cici never left each other side besides going to the bathroom they stood incredibly close, taking laughing and whispering things to eachother mostly in their mother tounge, I thought things were going well my best friend and my boyfriend getting along really well. 
After that I went back to his and we crashed for the night, we cuddled and he said how much he loved me and I made him feel safe and that he can't imagine being with anyone else. 
The next morning as he was driving me home he couldn't stop talking about CiCi and he feels bad about her situation and how good she looks and how someone could throw her away and treat her so badly. This made me feel awkward how he was talking about her appearance. But I looked past it.

About 2 weeks go by I get a phone call after work from Stan saying that he dosnt want to be with me anymore that he hasn't for a while now. I asked when did he start feeling like this, he replied after we went out with his friends, he said I wanted more from him than he wants from me, I could tell there was more and I mustered everything I had in me and calmly I said I feel like there is more your not telling me, he turned around and said ""he never knew how to tell me but he tried so hard to push past it but, I was everything he wanted I had the personality and heart, the love from me is everything he wanted but I was to FAT for him all along!!""
I went silent my heart shattered. 
Then he proceeded to tell me that ""he really thought that he could push past it till i lost all my weight but after meeting CiCi he just couldn't be with me anymore""
I hung up and my phone brew up with miss calls and messages. I kept my cool when I got home and once my kids where in bed I went for a shower and broke crying and blaming myself. I saw there was over 50 missed calls and over 100 texts, I blocked his number and all his socials, Looking in the mirror i thought the worst of myself. 2 days go past and I didn't speak to anyone I was numb at the world even going to work as a zombie I shut all emotions off.

I called my best friend CiCi 2 days after she was worried cause I never go quiet on her, and i told her everything she wanted to rip him a new one I told her it's not necessary his last words to me would eat him alive, and best thing i can do is move on and heal and keep at my weightloss journey... she cursed him and wished he was dead. She wanted to kill him. 2 week after the break up i lost close to 5kg from barely eating struggling of his words but I eventually healed after 2months I became myself and things were getting better again. Even though his words have affected me i became more confident within myself losing just over 86kg i was happy healthy and confident within myself.

In the start of August I went on a dating app to see what it was like being out of the dating game for a while I was curious. Alot of toads were on there just wanted either sex or money was kinda losing hope of finding someone I could spend the rest of my life with. My now partner Thomas found me on the dateing app. We got talking and became verry smitten with each other. We had similar trumars and similar values and goals. We are both parents,  he had a daughter and I had my two kids. We bonded in a intimate soul binding way and fell for him harder than anything I expected.  20 days later he asked me to be his partner. I was in cloud nine. The whole time I was telling my best friend CiCi what was going on she was behind me all the way. She was so happy for me. All my friends are happy for me. My long term friend Ned who I've known for over 10years who introduced me to Stan says he's never seen me happier and so happy that his two closest friends have found love again. I asked who is the other. He said it was Stan. He talks about how in love he is with his new gf but never told Ned who she was. I was too happy in my new relationship to give it much thought or feeling I just said to Ned I'm happy for him.


About 3 weeks into my relationship with Thomas I received a call from CiCi, she was crying and sounded drunk. It took me half hour to calm her down. 
When I was able to understand her she says she's made a horrible mistake and fears ill never forgive her.

She goes on to tell me that she had been in the car driving to the vets her lkng time pet shes had for nearly 20years had past away due to old age. I cried with her over the phone. Then I hear a voice, a man voice on the other end. I asked CiCi who she was with.... she says why dose it matter, I can be friends with whoever I want.
I said that's true but why get defensive.
She then snaped from crying to angry and addmitted she has been in contact with Stan for nearly 2 months and they became friends close friends. And she continued calling me crazy and insecure for asking who she's with and who she's friends with. I replied calmly I don't care be friends with him if that's what you want....

I was hurt but I've always been the type of person who's pretty chill and never stopping my friends staying friends with my exs especially if they were friends before hand but she expressed so much hatred towards him for doing what he did to me. But I find it weird how (and I did the maths) that shortly after she cursed him then became friends with him.
I said I had to go needed to go to the toilet and hung up.

 A week goes by, I was at my partners place, and I hear nothing from CiCi after our phone call, finally at 5 minutes after midnight she calls me in tears again.
Confessing that her and Stan got drunk together and they kissed. 
I was shattered but deep down I know when CiCi drinks if she dosnt stop with just a kiss so I know she was lieing. 
She sore black and blue that it was only a kiss, that she only kissed him because she wanted to hurt her ex and wasn't thinking, she says she ended the friendship with him and wants nothing to do with him and hopes I can forgive her.

I told her that this was a dog act she knew he hurt me badly and she expressed so much hatered towards him but gets close to him. 
I then said I need time to process this. And ended the phone call. That night I cried myself to sleep in my partners arms and he stroked my hair till I fell asleep.

After I woke up I had a shower got changed made a coffee in my giant travel mug and went to work i left 2 hours before work because CiCi's house was 5 minutes from work so I was hoping to talk to her one on one and see if there is any hope she would tell me exactly what happened and we can mend the situation and friendship. 
But when I got there Stan's car was parked outside her house. (Since he lives nearly 2hrs from her guess he never left last night) 
I just drove straight to work and started an hour early and clocked of and hour early. 
On my way home I drove past her place to see if he had gone so me and her can talk but to my surprise his car was still there. Being a Saturday he didn't have work and she was a stay at home mum, guess he was there all day. On the way home I got a phone call from the police asking me questions about CiCi and her relationship with her ex and her children. I told the truth and told the police officer all I knew and he informs me that CiCi filled this paperwork out when AJ wanted to take her to court and that I was labled as the ex best friend and asked what happened between us. I said I had no clue I thought she was. He then admitted that she had lost her court case that they are just going through more statements and wanted to get my side.

I arrived home to find my step sister and her partner came over we had a bbq and caught up even my folks came over and it was a great distraction. My phone was in my room the whole night till they left which was around 5 hours I came to my phone blown up with threats and guilt blaming. Saying if you don't reply I'm going to do it again with him (meaning stan) 
I looked at my phone in complete shock i thought to my self. I thought she said it was only a kiss but refrained myself.  
I sat on my bed taking deep breaths and explained calmly that I was having a family bbq and my phone was in my room. 
I hope you and Stan have a great life together you both lied to me. 
And I blocked her on everything.

3 days go by and my daughters dad (tom) calling me asking me what is going on between CiCi and if I am drink driving and doing drugs he will take me to court and he will take our daughter from me, i was confused saying what us he in about... 
He said that CiCi has been texting him and his whole family saying I've been drink driving with my kids in the car and doing drugs around them and sends him the pictures we took of me having a drink when we went out, Also telling him that I was cheating on him with her partner and hooking up with her ex partners. I was shocked and I told Tom everything. He says he and his family don't believe her but send ne everything that she's sending them , but if it's true this is my warning. I straight up said if he wants I'll go straight to the doctors and police for breath tests and blood tests also hair tests to prove it's all wrong. He said it's no need cause he knows I don't do drugs and I rarely drinks, and knows I protect my kids no matter what. I said to him what the police man said to me and we both agree since she lost her kids she wants me to lose mine.

I then got incontact with some of my ex partners and found out she had been seeing some of them in secret and had sexual relations with some of them. So far including Stan, she had been with 4 of my ex partners.
Even my eldest sons dad (James) that abused me then when I left he abused my 3yr old son. He recieved a black eye and 2 degree burns on most of his body and took him to court and won custody and she was close friends with him for 4 years after I left him she became close friends with him and kept it a secret from me. I didn't contact James to find this out but CiCi ex that won the court case and sent me the proof and thought I had a right to know. Photos of screen shots of all their messages... 
This crushed me.
I feel like I never knew this girl. 

Fast track to a month ago from today and it's now late April of 2025 I got a call off a private number I was half asleep and I woke up to a grumpy Helllloooo?

I hear a teary voice on the other end asking if it was me. I said yes who is this clearly I was in zombie mode and my brain didn't realise who it was. She said it was CiCi and can we talk. As soon as she announced who it was I screamed HEEELLLLL NOOO!
I hung up. She kept calling and I rejected her calls. I then sent a text to her mum telling her everything and her daughter has no right to call me to talk. Sorry it is soo long. And if you made it this far I appreciate it.

Was or am I the A hole for not letting my ex best friend explain after ending our 25+year friendship? 
Should I hear her out or just keep away from her.

I'm a ( 27 f) moved back in with my parents a year ago. trust me I would love to have my own place as i work a full time job, and that would solve all my issues, but im paying off all my debt I ended up in from my previous relationship, im in school as well so I can't afford my own place. 

obviously I no longer have any privacy or space anymore, and my main thing is I live in my parents place for free (I used to have to pay rent before I moved out at 20) so I know if give them any type of attitude they will bring up the fact I live there for free. i work 45hrs a week, in online school, buy my own groceries clean up after myself and my cats, but  ive been struggling to get back on a routine for the last year, since moving back obviously I can't to the things I did living on my own, like cleaning when i want, having friends over and smoking cigarettes/weed, I can't even smoke in the backyard I have to leave the property, (which i do bc they dont smoke i get that)

 I work night shift (have been for the last 6 years) 
my parents are retired and are always home, I started sleeping with ear plugs so they don't usually wake me up, but it's the constantly coming into my room while I'm sleeping, waking me up to do chores/favors, always on me about my spending (I have to buy my own groceries but they always tell me I'm spending to much) always  having any conversation turn into a lecture bc they dont like or agree with anything i do, they tell me I don't spend enough time with them, i do try to but i am busy alot, and always always always going through my stuff,  thru my mail, they are very very opinionated so anytime I do anything there's always some comment, ex: they hate coffee so everytime I make coffee they come into the kitchen to tell me the smell is gross and I shouldn't be making coffee. I know this stuff is little and I've been ignoring it but goddamn I swear they've gotten worse since I moved out LOL 

 i have tried multiple times, in multiple ways to kindly say "" I just got done a 12hr work shift, I really don't want to sit in the living room with you and watch the news, or talk about how in debt I am, I just want to sit in my room in slience"" or ""im trying to work out and do my yoga so can you please not stand at the door way and stare at me"" im not a morning person so I usually dont even talk to them when i wake up, and ive also mentioned im not a morning person so just dont even acknowledge me, but its always ""oh someones being a brat today""

. i only see my boyfriend on weekends as he lives an hour away, and sleep overs are not allowed at their house, so usually we just want to sit in my room and relax or go on a day trip but then its ""oh well we wanna get to know ur boyfriend so you need to sit in the living room with us, why are you avoiding us""  and every time  i always get told I'm being a brat and have a shit attitude, idk what to even say to them at this point lol ",0,1745811991.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

I made it through my surgery on 4/23, got discharged the next day and have had no issues. I had my first bowel movement this afternoon, it was solid but soft, and dark in color. 

A couple hours later, I had dark stool again. This time, it was more like diarrhea, but it had that coffee grounds sort of look to it. I had that twice in small amounts, then called the on call triage nurse where I had my surgery. She talked to the on call surgeon, who happened to be my surgeon, and he said it can be very normal after surgery to have the old blood in stools. He said I've I'm still having it by Tuesday, that I need to call back. 

I haven't felt dizzy, although now I do and I'm trying to tell myself it's from anxiety. No fever at any point, no bleeding or leaking from my wounds. I've been doing well with the diet, been able to get down soups, energy drinks, smooth move tea, pudding. I am also taking a calcium magnesium powder, as well as a multivitamin with iron in it.

1k9mb2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1k9mb2s/aa_working_in_mysterious_ways/,AA working in mysterious ways,"Hi y‚Äôall 

I wanted to share this story because it really changed what my recovery meant for me. 

I was adopted when I was an infant, due in large part to my birth father‚Äôs alcoholism. The story was always vague and peices came out over the years. When I got older the story started to make more sense. Mostly because I had come to my alcoholism at a ripe age, flying off the handle into addiction and institutionalisation. 

Fast forward, past rehab and therapy and finally getting myself through the open door of AA (after 10 years of flying in and out the window) - I came to accept my alcoholism. 

I had always wanted to get in touch with my birth family but was full of fear and resentment. I worked through it in step 4 but the fear was still so deep rooted. My birth mother had been in touch but from what I could comprehend - she wasn‚Äôt well. I steered clear until I was further into the steps. Going through the steps I felt a deepening connection to my birth father and a growing empathy for him. I was always so sure he was still out there drinking. 

I finally took on the decision and help of a higher power and sponsorship to finally open myself to getting in touch with my birth father. I had kept an eye on his FB profile for a few years and this time around, I was devastated to find out he had died. This was probably one of the most painful things I‚Äôve experienced and not just for reasons of his passing.  Much to my joy and sadness, I found written in his obituary details of how many people he had helped through the AA program. Specifically in the armed forces service branch - because he himself had served for many years in the army. Apparently he is two podcasts/talks about this subject. I‚Äôve tried to find them but no avail - one day I pray they will come to me. The pain is still so present in me but the joy of knowing his service was so important to many, remedies it.  I would give anything to have had 5 minutes with him, even if we just talked about recovery and nothing else. 

Fast track to finally approaching my birth mother - I find out she decided to get sober too. Her and my birth father had been in contact before his death and she informed me they had made amends to one another and that he was a gift to the world - helping 100s of people. This is a double whammy of pain and joy. So, even in isolation - AA seems to run in my blood. 

It‚Äôs been over a year since I found out and I still can‚Äôt imagine myself being alive if it hadn‚Äôt been for AA at that time. My worst fear came true and I didn‚Äôt drink on it, which is a miracle: but man does it still fucking hurt. An important lesson for me I‚Äôm not letting fear block me from being in connection with others. When I ask to have my selfishness removed from the situation, I clearly see - how wonderful it is that he got sober, tirelessly helped others and healed the deeply fractured relationship he had with my birth mother. 


Here‚Äôs to Mark E and all his service, I raise a cup of coffee to him and our wonderful fellowship 




Long story short: my long lost father was also in AA

After being saved by his sister, Tabane decides to fund a new home for Ichika and Chifuyu. Tabane was able to find land near where Ichika and Chifuyu original house was at. With some help of experts, the house had a 2m (6ft) tall, brick wall the surrounds the house. The house itself, is two stories tall with a basement, with an attic.The house itself is made out of heavy duty materials, with a layer to reduce sound. All the doors are made of steel, with the doors connected to the wall, and the main door of the house are heavily reenforced. The windows have two layers. The outer layer is bullet proof, with the inner layer allowing only one way window allowing anyone inside to look outside but not vise versa. 

With Dan's suggestion, and with several blackouts, Ichika with permission of Chifuyu and Tabane's funding, decided to stock up supplies, having solar panels installed, purchasing several power stations, water containers, canned food and also other stuff the Tabane and Dan encourage to buy.

During his first year in high school, during school break, Ichika heard news that riots were happing near a University that was very far away. He didn't think much about it, but he got a call from Tabane. She told him to stock up in supplies since she doesn't believe the riots are normal riots. She sent him extra funds to prepare. She also told him she already got in contact with Chifuyu. With that Ichika decided to tell Dan and to come to his house since Dan's parents were outside the country in family matters, and Ran was at the IS Academy. 

Dan brought from his home in a cart; water bottles, instant coffee, soda/energy drinks, energy/protein bars, his laptop, clean cloths and a radio from Dan's house. 

Both of them bought even more water bottles, power banks, a power station, 3 different decks of playing cards, canned food, portable stove with fuel for it, an electric stove, 2 way radio, a baseball bat, extra cleans cloths, extra medication, four first aid kits, a fire extinguisher, and other stuff. 

They did this for several days until the 'riots' got close to the city in which they decided to bunker in. They check inventory, they noted that they had enough food and water for 6 months for both of them, and had supplies to farm and collect rain water. 

Through the radio, tv, and internet, they see how the 'virus' infects people and how the infected behave.

Though as time goes on, they are left to decide of they let other people to join them or to keep to themselves. ",1,1745811403.0,InfiniteStratos,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just PPD or overthinking but sometimes it‚Äôs hard to talk myself out of it. 

My husband is deployed & I stay home so it‚Äôs just me & baby (3months today) home 24/7. I occasionally see family or friends & sometimes we get out of the house. The weather has been kinda cold and rainy where we live so it‚Äôs hard to go outside. He‚Äôs been too young to go to coffee-play places plus there‚Äôs measles outbreaks. I feel so bad bc he‚Äôs just stuck with me. ALL DAY. 

I love him & I love spending time with him but my energy has been low so it‚Äôs hard to do a lot. My brain can‚Äôt think of fun things to do with him. We don‚Äôt do screen time either, but he‚Äôs pretty good at entertaining himself when I need to do things. 

Whenever I‚Äôm around family, he laughs & smiles and talks all the time. But when it‚Äôs just us I feel like he‚Äôs so distracted & wants nothing to do with me other than to eat r be held. He doesn‚Äôt want to play anymore, just eat his hands and look around lmao. 

I took him to church today & put him in the nursery for the first time‚Ä¶I expected him to cry tbh, but he didn‚Äôt. The volunteers said ‚Äúoh he‚Äôs just the happiest baby‚Äù ‚Äúhe‚Äôs all smiles‚Äù. When I went to check on him he was like, fussy in my arms. I cried really hard bc he was happier with strangers.

Im running out of energy & I don‚Äôt have family nearby anymore since I‚Äôm back where we live. I miss my happy baby but I can‚Äôt seem to bring it out of him like other people can. (He does smile & laugh but maybe 20% compared to like 80% with other people.) 

He just wants to be held all the time bc he only wants to sit or stand but he can‚Äôt yet. He‚Äôs so heavy & I hold him literally all the time but he‚Äôs like 16.5lbs. I‚Äôm literally wrecking my body‚Ä¶like my hands are numb & tingly now all the time. He hates carriers, I‚Äôve tried like 5 different ones.

We usually sit and talk for at least an hour while drinking our coffees. Today, a girl, probably around 15-17 came in. She had severe burn scars on her face and upper right arm, while the arm below the elbow was gone, presumably in the same event that left her scarred. She came in with two slightly older women, maybe family? Not sure. Now, my Starbucks has two entrances - a back door leading to a parking lot, and a front door with large floor to ceiling windows with a view of the street and those on the sidewalk passing by. My dad and I always come through the back door and after getting our coffees, sit near the back - however, I always sit facing the front door so I can see out the windows. I've always loved people watching. When the girl and women came in, after ordering they sat at a table near the windows. I'm sure you see where this is going. After conversation had trailed off with my dad, I sat facing the windows watching everyone who came in and out of the Starbucks. I was not staring at the girl - however, the way I was angled and where she was sitting could have made her and her companions think I was. As I was lost in thought, thinking of a particularly unfortunate outfit a man had just come in wearing, I sensed a lot of movement coming from the girl's table. Naturally, my eyes slid over where I was greeted with the sight of the two women at the girl's table glaring at me. The younger of those women was making faces at me while the older one waved, but not a nice wave. I was confused at first and waved back, without realizing the rudeness behind her initial wave. She then rolled her eyes at me and made some rude faces, and I made a confused face and said ""What?"" out loud. She rolled her eyes and waved again. At this point, I had realized that it wasn't a nice wave and rolled my eyes back at her. She then continued to glare and turned back around to talk to the others at the table. For the rest of the time my dad and I were there, she turned around multiple times to glare. We ordered a tea to take home to my mom and I walked over to get it - the counter was near their table. As I walked by, the women stared at me. I rolled my eyes and glared at them, but I don't know if that was the right move. AITAH for inadvertently staring and possibly making this girl feel bad? By the way, she was really, really pretty. That was what I first thought when she walked in, before I even really noticed the scarring (which didn't affect her beauty).

After writing this out, I'm pretty sure I'm not in the wrong, but I would still love some feedback on how I could have possibly handled the situation better!!

EDIT: I should have clarified the part with the man wearing an ""unfortunate outfit"" but didn't - it was NOT a stranger. It was my older brother who came in (he didn't know my dad and I were there) wearing a shirt I hate. I didn't think about how that would come across, I'm sorry!

EDIT 2: I've had a problem staring since I was a kid (at everything, from squirrels and leaves to people) and it's totally possible I WAS staring at her and didn't know. I've gotten so used to staring out the Starbucks window in the same spot that I am sure I was staring at some point. BUT!!! I've also had frequent problems with people staring at me due to an abundance of sh scars on my arms and legs and I know how it can make people feel to get stared at so I try really really hard to make other people feel that way. Thankfully no one's stared in a while, but I will never forget the feeling of eyes on me when I'm just trying to live.",2,1745811229.0,AITAH,7,0.75,False

hello again redditors! i have returned once again after a long slumber to grace your subreddit with stilted, self-deprecating doomposting, AKA the only language I actually speak! 



i'll get the basics out of the way quick- i'm 38, cis male, in the Cleveland suburban area, have never dated, and am *intensely* neurodivergent. i don't like to take or even look at pictures of myself, so reddit gives me a way to interact with new people without gating participation behind selfies like dating apps do. i suppose i've turned out half decent flying 100% solo for my entire adulthood but i mean i'm almost 40 and i admit to feeling a little bit of relationship FOMO, so here goes (if anything at all goes wrong because of this i will return to my reclusive ways and die a hermit so no pressure!!!!).



some ~~stupid~~ tidbits about me/conversation starters: 



\-cats are good. i have a cat. she is spoiled. i snuggle the cat. (dogs are fine too but my tolerance of noise and dog smells is pretty low, so most dogs probably aren't for me.)



\-i hate to put negatives in these kinds of posts because i think they often come across as aggressive and mean, but it needs to be said- **i have zero interest in children**. zip. zilch. nada. i want none for myself and I have no interest in parenting yours. seriously, i would make a bad dad. you don't want this smoke. 



\-i work in tech so i dabble in many of the nerdy spectrum hobbies- gaming, reading stupid tech docs, writing craptacular code, ~~smashing misbehaving routers with a hammer~~ etc. i have a switch and xbox but 99.99% of my gaming is PC. 



\-i'm pretty settled and financially stable. bonus points if you are.



\-some extra talking points in case you need any more: coffee, fitness, ~~highly obscure sludge metal bands,~~ fragrances, watches, terrible movies, cooking.

It feels kind of personal or something like strangers showing me photos of them in a relationship, and then I think am I giving off a vibe and they need to remind me they‚Äôre taken I don‚Äôt get it? seems like more of a guy issue, I feel like girls will mention their boyfriend like once or twice but men are just like gf gf gf

also I can imagine if you‚Äôve just started dating it makes sense but when you‚Äôve been together for 7 years plus it‚Äôs like annoying thanks for letting me vent I‚Äôm getting very tired of it üòû and I don‚Äôt understand why people need to do this.",2,1745810707.0,PetPeeves,0,1.0,False

While this documentation may be brief and might not fully capture everything happening within me, I will do my best to articulate my thoughts.   
The effects of high caffeine can manifest in two distinct ways:  
 1. \*\*Increased Observance\*\*: During this phase, I become highly observant, paying attention to every little detail of things that pique my interest. I notice minor changes, such as a slight alteration in someone's hair or tiny spelling mistakes. However, this heightened awareness also comes with extra nervousness and anxiety.   
The anxiety manifests in waves:  
 \- The first wave brings a heavy sensation in my head and makes my face feel swollen. - The second wave is accompanied by cold hands and feet, heavy breathing, an increased heartbeat, and an urgent need to use the bathroom.  
 \- The subsequent waves are milder, where I experience a sense of calm and control over my mind.  
 \- I also often feel sudden tingling in my body, shivering, and a sense of goosebumps, indicating that the effects are setting in.  
 2. \*\*Sleepiness\*\*: Alternatively, I may feel very sleepy, clumsy, and tired. At this point, I become restless, struggling to relax. During this phase, I tend to disregard what is happening in the outside world.   
  
I have tried various caffeine sources, including instant coffee, Red Bull, liquid coffee, and Monster drinks, and have received the same results each time. Right now, I am experiencing the sleepy and tired phase.

I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has experienced this one as well. It gives me just the worst sinking feeling thinking about it still but it felt so real and I couldn‚Äôt leave the dream no matter how much I woke my self up that night I went right back in it. And they were pissed I kept leaving. 

Anyways in my dream there‚Äôs a man late 40s shoulder length hair very calm and persuasive personality to him but over exaggerated smile and he has an assistant but she or he doesn‚Äôt have clear details it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre blocked in my memory but basically they approach people offering job applications in busy settings to try sign on people for ‚ÄúThis job ‚Äú

The main setting is  like a huge white slope with like stations to either side and each station are portals to different realms or something like that. And the very last one at the bottom to the right side is the portal to home and it‚Äôs essentially some sort of trafficking situation and you‚Äôre stuck having to go to where you‚Äôre ordered to go for specific reasons through each portal station. But you can not go back home or else you‚Äôre done for. They seem to have to have you sign your soul over to  them before they can take you there which is why they offer jobs to young people in a coffee shop or at the mall .  
This place was so familiar so was this man in my dream I had went back to it to try find and get my sister out who had just unknowingly signed herself over to them and I knew what it really was but wasn‚Äôt allowed to tell her like for I would have been killed and unable to return to our world for warning her in the moment.

She lives 5 blocks away and got my number through some digging in my friend's group. She apparently followed me to my block to see where I live, and introduced herself to my mom as a ""friend"". She texted that she really liked me and wanted to meet over coffee sometime.

The thing is guys that I am a very closed off person since my childhood. Idk why, but all of her digging and ""stalking"" has kind of creeped me out. I feel its an invasion of my privacy and honestly don't know what to do. If I turned her down, would it lead to even more consequences as she might track me down everywhere further ? 

I am actually single and crave relationships but, this stalking isn't how I imagine people to meet. She could have just met me before texting me and asked this stuff too right ?

AITA for thinking to reject a girl because who is invading my sense of security ?

1k9lxna,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianPolitics/comments/1k9lxna/why_i_cannot_vote_conservative/,Why I cannot vote Conservative.,"\[This is an opinion piece\]  
Fear, Rage, and Value.

I‚Äôll break this down into Four parts. Party, Leader, Members, People.

¬†

Party: I have yet to hear an actual plan from the conservatives. Not one. Ten damn years of complaining and not one plan to do better. Just hollow words of ‚Äúif we were in charge we wouldn‚Äôt have this problem,‚Äù The fact they were caught flat footed when Carney called the Snap Election tells me all I need to know about their ability to plan. The fact that after a decade they didn‚Äôt have a stack of prepared ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù campaign plans boggles my mind. All they do is make Angry people Angrier. And Angry people don‚Äôt think before they vote, they just vote against what their mad at.

¬†

Leader: Pierre Poilievre has to be the worst conservative leader in modern history. Trump had at least some form of success before stepping into the public eye (If you squint and tilt your head to the side. No the other side). All Pierre‚Äôs done is vote against the Canadian people. Gets in, serves long enough to get a pension, then retires, and votes to slam the door behind him so no one else can do his little exploit. His voting record show him never showing his own views, never standing up for what he believes in. All he does is ‚ÄúVote with the party.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want a sheep in charge of this nation. His handling of covid and the trucker convoy are a disgrace to Canada. Saving Canadian LIVES and the Canadian economy is too expensive? Handing out coffee and doughnuts to people defecating in public, causing hearing damage from how loud their horns are and holding a city hostage because they have the mass, fuel, and people to do a lot of damage if they are told to leave. They have the right to protest yes. They do NOT have the right to bring multiple cities to a grinding halt, to threaten, harass, and verbally berate anyone that walks past them. Lastly onto more recent events. Hand full of ‚Äúno, don‚Äôt annex us,‚Äù with about the same amount of heart as a wet noodle. No slogans against it, other than ‚ÄúMake ~~America~~ Canada Great Again‚Äù (Pretty sure trump could sue for copyright infringement.) Has he demanded for his party members to remove any support the budding MAGA regime to the South? Nope. Has he denounced any of the ‚ÄúDeport them All‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaple MAGA‚Äù crowd that he doesn‚Äôt want their vote and to get out of his Party? Nope. And TODAY he held a rally a day after a terrorist attack in Vancouver. I‚Äôve seen enough to know the measure of this man. He shouldn‚Äôt be in charge and a D&D group much less a Nation.

¬†

Members: Housing is largely run by Provincial governments, now if the Libs are to blame for it. Than Conservative run provincial governments should have the lowest rent, and housing costs and the heights amount of homes. They don‚Äôt. The problem is we let private corporations buy all the housing and jack up the prices. The commodification of housing is to blame. Not immigrants, not the Woke and not the liberal party. We are for not putting enough pressure on the people in charge to address the actual problem.

¬†

People: There are only two root emotions. Love And Fear. You don‚Äôt get rage from love. You don‚Äôt get hate from love. You get hope from love. You get pride from love. I don‚Äôt see conservatives stoking hope for a better tomorrow in crowds. I see punchy words to stoke the fear of the hard times of the past are to continue. I hear hollow words of past glory. A past that was nice for a few, and hell for a whole lot more. All I see from the conservatives are people fanning the flames of hatred and fear. Giving people an answer that simple, easy to understand, gives a target for their rage, and that is completely wrong.

¬†

I will end with Value. Recently the Cons sent out a poll. One of the questions asked the poll taker to choose between ‚ÄúWoke Culture.‚Äù And ‚ÄúWarrior Culture.‚Äù Well that‚Äôs quite telling isn‚Äôt it? You don‚Äôt want a warrior culture in peace time do you? A warrior culture is quite safe, if you lead it, that is. In a warrior culture you are either the leader, a warrior, sub human, or are a prize for warriors and leaders. Here‚Äôs the rub, a warrior isn‚Äôt a hero, isn‚Äôt even a person. It‚Äôs a currency. To be spent at the whims of the Leaders, by the thousands. Men between the ages of 15 and 50, whose greatest contribution to society is to die in the dirt in service to the great glorious nation.

I guess it makes me woke to want the culture where Cis straight men‚Äôs lives have more value than a fucking penny.

1k9lx14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/1k9lx14/way_of_kings_my_review/,Way of Kings: My Review,"Please no explicit spoilers past Way of Kings...

So I picked up this book sometime in the Fall of 2024. I read about 200 pages during the first couple weeks then found myself picking up other books. Way of Kings stayed on my nightstand, but it wasn't my go-to. Reading the first part of this book felt like a bit of a chore. I knew, from its reputation, that I just needed to read further. Once I hit the 350-page mark, things started going much quicker and I ended up finishing the remainder of the book in a few weeks.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The world-building in this WoK is really in a league of its own. I am not sure if I have ever known another fantasy series that has this kind of depth in its debut novel. The primary three characters (Kaladin, Dalinar, Shallan) all felt very fleshed-out and complete. My primary complaint with this book was the length. I understand this series is a marathon, not a sprint - but the first few hundred pages were a real slow burn for me. All that being said, the payoff at the end is incredibly satisfying and totally worth it. I am consistently impressed by Sanderson's ability to create such crisp and satisfying endings.

  
**Kaladin**: Let me preface by saying, I loved Kaladin. Sanderson did a really amazing job writing him and fleshing out the relationship he had with his family. I also really enjoyed watching his relationship with Syl continue to flourish throughout the book. Candidly, some of the Kaladin chapters are where I really struggled with the book. I personally have some issues with the 'hero who feels so much guilt all the time' trope. Especially when it becomes obvious to the readers early that, said hero, shouldn't feel guilty. I felt the middle of the book was largely dominated by a lot of Kaladin misery in Bridge Four. Then it was dominated by a lot of Kaladin's backstory. This is where the book started to feel dense and plot details started to blur. In areas where we get Kaladin flashbacks, I wanted more Shallan/Dalinar flashbacks. 

**Dalinar:** Probably my favorite character thus far. Watching Dalinar navigate his visions and the (obviously screwed up but interesting) Alethi court was so engaging. The scene at the end when he gives his Shardblade up for the Bridge Crews was phenomenal. I think I may have clapped in the coffee shop I was reading in. I really would enjoy seeing more of Dalinar's past in future books. I also really enjoyed his relationships with secondary characters: Adolin, Navani, Sadeas, Elkholar. Also I LOVE Gallant. Get that good boy a Shard saddle immediately.

**Shallan**: I found Shallan and Jasnah to be the most interesting relationship in the entire book. For me, their storyline so easy to read as I felt like I was piecing information together alongside the pair. The ending with these two was one of the most climactic non-action sequences I have read in awhile. I think I am the most eager to see these two in the next book.

1k9lvza,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1k9lvza/aussie_culture_around_dating/,Aussie culture around dating,"Hi! 45F here, POC who has lived across the globe and living in Melbourne since 3 years and absolutely loving it! 
I don‚Äôt find making friends here challenging as I am very regular on meetups and have hobbies like hiking, dancing etc. I end up making a lot of women friends in these places. 
However dating has been a challenge here. I never used dating apps before moving to Australia. Started using them here and it‚Äôs not great at all! The men I met.. I just found them extremely low effort compared to men I dated in other western countries. 
Few things I wanted to understand.

1. Is 50-50 a normal thing to do on first date? Paying for your own share? I believe in 50-50 or pay for rounds as we are practically strangers at that point. Outside Australia, men have never allowed me to pay. However, here, it‚Äôs almost as if men demand that I pay. Do I state before going on the date that I will pay for myself ? Or is it assumed? Is it normal to discuss who is paying? I don‚Äôt even do that with my friends coz we all know we are paying for ourselves. I don‚Äôt expect man to pay all the time but the experiences I had almost borderlined on rude behaviour to me. 
And at one of the dates, it looked like the man expected me to pay. interestingly, all of these men were well placed and in stable jobs. The only guys who readily paid for the dates were what I would call as f**kboys. 

2. After 5-6 dates, Men rarely initiate texts, call or follow ups. But if I initiate, they are happy to respond. I don‚Äôt mind initiating but after a while it gets tiring and I give up. 

3. Most men I met don‚Äôt plan dates properly at all. The first 1-2 dates maybe a coffee or restaurant but after that, it‚Äôs always - come over to my place. I‚Äôm a very outdoorsy person and these feel super boring to me after a point. Is this common? I like people who have hobbies and interests. 
I generally go for people like that and even they want to stay indoors when it comes to meeting up. 

4. Outside of dating apps, where do you meet people? I go to gym, dance classes, hikes but rarely do people interact and if they do, it rarely goes beyond a hi, how are you going? I do make more women friends in these places but men rarely approach me. 

5. Is race a thing even in dating apps? I rarely get matches from people from other ethnicities other than mine. I dunno if it‚Äôs the app doing it, but I never match with people from other cultures whereas Australia is actually one of the most multicultural country I have come across so it feels strange to me. I would like to connect with people from different cultures. 

6. How are speed dating events? I have come to know of few in my city.. might give it a try but I truly dunno what to expect and if it‚Äôs worth it. 

Other than the dating scene, I absolutely love Australia. After having lived across the globe, hand on my heart, this is  the best place to live imo! ",7,1745810181.0,AskAnAustralian,70,0.59,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The modern cast iron tea kettle blends traditional craftsmanship with contemporary design and functionality. These kettles are built to last, providing years of reliable service while adding a touch of elegance to any kitchen.

**Material and Construction:** Description of material and construction with specific details.

Cast iron tea kettles are typically made from high-quality cast iron, known for its excellent heat retention and durability. Many are enameled on the interior to prevent rusting and make cleaning easier. The exterior often features intricate designs and a durable finish that can withstand high temperatures. The weight of the kettle is a significant factor, reflecting the quality and thickness of the cast iron.

**Heat Retention:** Technical explanation with concrete details about materials or technologies.

One of the primary benefits of cast iron is its superior heat retention. Once heated, a cast iron tea kettle will maintain a consistent temperature for a prolonged period. This is crucial for brewing tea properly, as different types of tea require specific water temperatures to extract the optimal flavor. The thick walls of the cast iron distribute heat evenly, preventing hotspots that can scorch the tea leaves.

**Spout Design:** Description of another important specification with factual information.

The spout design is critical for controlled pouring. A well-designed spout should minimize drips and spills, ensuring a smooth and even flow of water. Some cast iron tea kettles feature a gooseneck spout, which provides even greater control, particularly useful for pour-over coffee or delicate teas. The angle and length of the spout influence the accuracy and ease of pouring.

**Handle and Lid:** Another important specification.

The handle of a cast iron tea kettle is typically made of cast iron or a heat-resistant material, such as wood or plastic. It's essential that the handle remains cool to the touch or provides adequate insulation to prevent burns. Similarly, the lid should fit snugly to retain heat and prevent spills, often featuring a knob or handle for easy removal.

**Capacity:**

Cast iron tea kettles come in various sizes, typically ranging from 20 to 40 ounces. The ideal capacity depends on individual needs and preferences. A smaller kettle may be suitable for single servings, while a larger kettle is better for entertaining guests or brewing multiple cups at once. Consider the number of people you typically brew tea for when selecting the appropriate capacity.

**Interior Coating:**

Many cast iron tea kettles feature an enameled interior, which serves several important purposes. The enamel coating prevents the cast iron from rusting, simplifies cleaning, and prevents the water from coming into direct contact with the iron, which can alter the taste. The enamel should be durable and resistant to chipping or cracking.

 ## Core Benefits

A cast iron tea kettle offers several distinct advantages over other types of tea kettles, making it a worthwhile investment for tea enthusiasts.

**Superior Heat Retention:** The [Cast Iron Tea Kettle] excels at maintaining water temperature for extended periods compared to electric kettles, which cool down rapidly. Users report consistent brewing temperatures, leading to more flavorful and aromatic tea. This translates to a more enjoyable and satisfying tea-drinking experience, especially for those who prefer multiple steepings.

**Enhanced Flavor Extraction:** With its [even heating], this product simplifies the brewing process, allowing tea leaves to unfurl and release their full flavor potential by eliminating the risk of scorching.

**Health Benefits:**

Some believe that cast iron tea kettles can contribute trace amounts of iron to the water, which may be beneficial for individuals with iron deficiencies. While the amount of iron leached into the water is minimal, it can be a supplemental source of this essential mineral. Always consult with a healthcare professional regarding your individual nutritional needs.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions and concerns to help potential buyers make informed decisions.

**Is the [Cast Iron Tea Kettle] suitable for all stovetops?**
  Yes, it's generally compatible with gas, electric, and induction stovetops. However, it's essential to check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure compatibility with your specific stovetop. Some older or specialized stovetops may not be suitable for use with cast iron cookware due to weight or surface compatibility.

**How do I clean and maintain my cast iron tea kettle?**
  Cleaning typically involves rinsing with warm water and a mild detergent. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as they can damage the enamel coating. Dry the kettle thoroughly after each use to prevent rusting. For uncoated interiors, a light coating of vegetable oil can help prevent rust.

**What is the warranty coverage?**
  Warranty coverage varies depending on the manufacturer. Most reputable brands offer a warranty of at least one year, covering defects in materials and workmanship. This includes issues such as enamel chipping, handle breakage, or leaks. Be sure to review the warranty terms and conditions before purchasing.

**Can I use my cast iron tea kettle to brew coffee?**

While primarily designed for tea, some cast iron kettles can be used to heat water for pour-over coffee. However, it's crucial to ensure the kettle is thoroughly cleaned and free of any tea residue, which can affect the flavor of the coffee. A gooseneck spout is particularly useful for precise pouring when making pour-over coffee.

That is the only opening statement I can give on this. Per United States Naval Regulations 1990 - Article 1129, all missions are required to give the necessary amount of after action reports per the discretion of the command. I have been tasked due to my‚Ä¶ close encounter of the maritime kind, but I‚Äôll get to that, originally I would just keep this stock until certain advisor elements have told me to retell this the best I can for archiving purposes. If you‚Äôre seeing this you are either a senior DOD intelligence officer, or it‚Äôs been declassified and posted to open source. 

‚Ä¶We might have bigger problems if it‚Äôs the latter. 

Some background to give context for this‚Ä¶ full disclosure I‚Äôm Petty Officer Second Class Spears, a Special Warfare Operator for the United States Navy for the last 9 years, popularly known as a ‚ÄúNavy Seal‚Äù. I‚Äôve been assigned to Team 4 for the last year and some change, Alpha Platoon, we fall under Navy Special Warfare Command‚Äôs Group 2 based out of good old Virginia proper. Our main AO is South America, I‚Äôve done time in with the Africa group, Indochina, but let‚Äôs just say South America is the ‚Äúfun time‚Äù region to be for many reasons, especially if you‚Äôre in your prime. Alright, enough fucking about before my O3 rides my ass‚Ä¶ 

He‚Äôs our Platoon Commander, Captain Daughtery, he‚Äôs from DEVGRU, a younger guy but he‚Äôs absolutely straight to the point: get in, get our tasks done, go home, get on the bird, get after it. He‚Äôs rotated off the line to get some time as a JOIC (Junior Officer In Charge) on another team, and you can tell he‚Äôs dying to get back. Working with him is our platoon chief, Chief Murphy‚Ä¶ going into an organization with a famous last name, especially one that was KIA, is an easy way for you to get hazed. You can tell he‚Äôs been dragged through the mud, despite this the old bronx salt dog that he is has survived‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs from DEVGRU too, Red Squadron but only because I caught sight of the old native head patch in his garage during a barbeque, he also carries the hatchet around too and I ain‚Äôt gonna be the one to ask if it‚Äôs for show. Alright, there‚Äôs the pertinent people in charge‚Ä¶ 

Back to our AO, as much as shore leave with partying is fun, Team 4‚Äôs AO isn‚Äôt as slow as you might think or we might want it to be. A large part of our mission set down there is ‚Äúcounter insurgency‚Äù, which ends up directly assisting partner nations in dealing with narco activity. Many times this means we go low profile, stack up with critical response teams, and almost always have to pull the heavier end of the weight by the end of the night. Sometimes however we get dispatched to conduct maritime ops with an SDV (Seal Delivery Team) or SWCC themselves, not that often but it‚Äôs not uncommon, most times it‚Äôs boats, once in a while it‚Äôs a sub, all of it to combat the trafficking of both drug product and human cattle that runs directly into the rest of the Americas. In terms of forever wars, it‚Äôs at least a mildly noble cause to fight for‚Ä¶ 

One thing you quickly learn about Team 4 versus 5, 7, and 10 is your intel is usually short notice, you‚Äôre not allowed to learn much else beyond hard borders set by your intelligence pax, and the situation can evolve completely down to the last ounce by the time you get there. Basically: you never know what the hell is going on until you‚Äôre boots down and sending it, nothing embodies that more than this mission. 
It was just past new years when we were spun up at the crack of dawn for a VBSS (Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure) of a vessel that had lost communication with the mainland several nautical miles off the coast of Peru towards Chile. We got to our ad hoc TOC for a briefing, coffee and caffeine rampant as we tried to remain wide awake for what came next. A man only identifying himself as someone from the ‚ÄúState Department‚Äù greeted us inside of that plywood, box fan shack, standing next to a Peruvian intelligence officer. The dude was bald, sporting a five o‚Äôclock shadow, and dressed like an accountant‚Ä¶ the stress lines told me he spent more time in country than home, that was enough to tell us to pay attention. The Peruvian would talk in his native language as the dude immediately translated to us what was happening, along with his own input. 

The vessel was a dutch cargo freighter, ‚ÄúAmity‚Äù, approximately 400 meters long, a control tower towards the rear, marked out of Thailand that was set to transport foods and perishable goods to the Peruvian capital of Lima. At 2214 hours several days ago, it missed its window to begin its route in and continued southwards, going deep towards the Chile coast. When attempting to hail it, messages responded with only static, Peruvian Navy contemplated sending a vessel to conduct a welfare check however a harsh winter storm made waters unsafe. Surprisingly the vessel was still topside, and when a message got through‚Ä¶ 

They played a recording of it as we all read a print out of the transmission. Amity responded signaling immediate distress, saying ‚Äúwe have been boarded, we have been boarded‚Äù. Control personnel began to try and zero in on Amity‚Äôs position as they gauged for more information, when asked about the size of the attacking vessel‚Ä¶ Amity simply responded: ‚Äúno opposing boat‚Äù and then followed up saying; ‚Äúthey have overrun the deck‚Äù. The background sounds nearly drowned out the voice, automatic gunfire could be heard.

This‚Ä¶ caused a fair amount of confusion, my Platoon Commander especially double took and eyed around‚Ä¶. In what was less than 6 minutes, a massive freighter had not only been boarded, but had their entire top deck seized. The final message seemed to cap off the sour feeling of anxiety that was lurking, as in an all too monotone voice the man simply said: ‚ÄúThey can see me, I‚Äôve been found‚Äù. Afterwards‚Ä¶ the transponder turned off making locating it difficult. 

This is when things got weirder‚Ä¶ Amity was found nearly 40 degrees off their trajectory, several hundred nautical miles where they were before the storm. No other vessels could be located, even so much as a set of rogue rafts used by pirates. Pirate activity in the area as well is almost nothing, cartels didn‚Äôt want to mess with international shipping lanes lest they bring down the hammer of INTERPOL on themselves and things get messy. It physically made no sense that anyone could reach a vessel of that size, in rough waves, with no craft, no raft, and board, with no clear motive. 

Locals were dragging feet for days without sending any response, citing ‚Äúrough conditions‚Äù as an excuse to let the freighter collect dust. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ sadly more common than you‚Äôd think, likewise they pressured the US after the contracting agency responsible for the cargo was marked to be an American pharmaceutical company attempting to have them cut down through dragon's pass versus the Panama Canal. Chief immediately picked out something: ‚Äú-If they were tasked to stop at Lima, why go through Dragon‚Äôs pass?‚Äù. The Jaded fed simple took a long drag that killed half his cig, shrugging ‚Äúgood question‚Ä¶‚Äù. 

Captain Daughtery looked unimpressed; ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre telling me their mess to avoid tariffs has us cleaning up their fiasco?‚Äù. The state rep shook his head ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre cleaning their fiasco. In approximately 2 hours you‚Äôre to board, seize, and secure the vessel and find out what‚Äôs become of the crew‚Äù. 

Would you believe this is one of the more positive interactions we‚Äôve had with feds in South America? 

The entire thing was just eerie, when we met up in the team room it was the captain, chief, myself and a few other senior guys. Daughtery exuded westpoint confidence and clarity, when he shut the wooden door and the water bottle use to counter weight slid down, leaving us in silence, I could see the dread behind his eyes. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ cartel? There was gunfire in the background‚Äù one of the other team leaders asked, Chief just shook his head in response. Daughtery however controlled the room ‚ÄúWhatever it is, we‚Äôll go deal with it, treat it as if anything else that could get intensely kinetic‚Ä¶ an air infil isn‚Äôt probable but we will have some bird coverage, Spears, you guys will be going up the side by ladder so make sure everyone‚Äôs got their MAS suit. The waves are reported to be very rough, so make sure we go out on an empty stomach. Keep your heads on and whatever this is will be over by supper‚Äù. 

If only it was that simple.

‚ÄúMAS‚Äù stands for Maritime Assault Suits, a grey waterproof suit specifically designed for Navy Special Warfare operators to use during boardings, dives, and other tactical inserts in and through the water. The grey used has also become fairly popular in the seal community, ‚ÄúMAS Grey‚Äù is a common gear theme and our platoon adopted it specifically for maritime operations. Within 15 minutes we had checked each other's assault suits, tightened down the slop, gotten our radios filled, roads loaded. It‚Äôs my personal opinion that human bodies have internal alarms to warn us when we‚Äôre walking into certain doom, back in ancient times we would look into a cave and see a face that just wasn‚Äôt right before getting out of there, a canyon that smelt of death. Now? I struggled to breathe even as the neck ring of my assault suit was fitted on and we were heading to the chalk. 

Normally an SDV team would meet with us as SWCC usually prioritized DEVGRU, however they were on sight ready to link up with us. We helped load their zodiacs into the CH-47s, heavy duty rafts with mounted weapons, the best you could get for light boarding and even then they were a pain to be in. Daughtery was going to be on my raft while Chief rode with the other, even if dawn was a few hours away the darkness mandated we wore our nods. 

Several radio checks came through, Chief chimed in‚Ä¶ then the SWCC crew chief; [‚Äúcraft is ready, Alpha-6 check‚Äù]. The commander followed: [‚ÄúThis is Alpha-6, platoon is ready, all pax green‚Äù]. 

A night VBSS onto a lost freighter, in which an unknown force had somehow overtaken the vessel‚Ä¶ moreover, the distress signalers final words stuck with me even as the engines drowned out all noise past my helmet‚Äôs headset: ‚ÄúThey have found me‚Äù. To be so calm in the face of defeat means resignation‚Ä¶ or something else. None of them are good answers, but we had to go figure out why it all happened. 

We immediately knew why an air landing was off the table when we got out there, the 47‚Äôs rotors battled the harsh winds so much the whole damn airbus was rocking back and forth. Even the commander gripped the overhead handle, glancing around under nods to ensure he had all his men. Soon we opted to get into the Zodiac‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a common thing in the open ocean, if the winds are rough the waves are twice as bad. I braced myself as the front SWCC gunner ensured his leash was fastened, checking his rotary M134 as everyone grabbed onto something even if it was each other. The crew chief signaled to the driver three fingers‚Ä¶. Then two‚Ä¶.. Then one. 

In seconds the Zodiac slid out, hitting the rough waves as we all bobbed, I don‚Äôt know how they did it, but even if the first wave of water made me think we all went under‚Ä¶ we didn't. It was cold, the sky was dark as the lights of the chinook disappeared leaving us to finish the job. In front of us was a dark horizon with a distant sunrise still hours away, the white phosphor of our night vision trying its best to give us some semblance but the crashing waves kept us moving and blind. You know it‚Äôs easier to go to space then it is the dead sea? I know why‚Ä¶ I hate the ocean, ironic cause I‚Äôm a seal, but being out there with that primordial body of water salivating at the chance to engulf us‚Ä¶ thousands of ships have gone missing over the past centuries, easy to understand why. 

Our second craft was to our nine o‚Äôclock as we pursued, the IR strobes on our helmets allowing us to see where we were. The distant rotar of our air cover was behind us, from what I could tell and heard after, they were doing everything they could to keep up. I could see the front gunner of the Zodiac scan around, then stop at something in front, he followed up on the radio; [‚ÄúPrimary objective, One O‚Äôclock‚Ä¶ adjust to 312 degrees‚Äù].

I peaked up, through the horizon of man high waves‚Ä¶ I could see it: The massive form of the cargo freighter looming in the distance, no lights showing that either power was out or they had gone dark. Neither was a good option‚Ä¶ As we grew closer, the larger it got, the rougher the waves were all I could think was‚Ä¶ what the hell could brave these conditions and lay claim to that vessel, that quickly. 

We passed the stern of the boat, SWCC opted to center around the port side as it was the closest. Despite the height of the boat, it was nothing we hadn‚Äôt done before. Two of our guys prepped the ladder prong‚Ä¶ You want to know why VBSS sucks? The ladder, you know those small, single person ladders you see at cheap carnivals, the prong has one of those attached, once it hooks it secure onto the edge of the vessel we then proceed to climb it‚Ä¶ in 90lbs of gear, in the dark, with rough waves, under night vision, often times assailants would commence an attack seeing as we were vulnerable and we would rely on support craft and air cover. For all our training and equipment, it was a dangerous job, one that made my stomach sink as the cold air and water doused us. 

The dark vessel loomed over us, nothing but shadows where there should be some sort of warning light‚Ä¶ knowing this had been left captured for days only made the feeling grow stronger. The gunner scanned around, a few of us noticed the rear of the ship‚Ä¶ the lack of broken waves, one of our guys called in; [‚ÄúPropeller is down, ship is adrift‚Äù]. 

We got to the port side, the SWCC crew keeping us steady so as not to get us all pulled under, an absolute death sentence when beside a monolithic hulk of metal. The tension rose, I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know why but I felt like everything was watching me as we all kept our barrels trained, on every shadow, every ledge, not from the ship but from the waves. I opted to go first as they secured the ladder, my captain gave me a pat on the shoulder as I climbed. One of our guys and a SWCC member kept the ladder steady, even then the thing shook like hell as I slowly climbed, praying it wouldn‚Äôt give away. All the while‚Ä¶ I could feel a burning sensation of something zeroing in on me, through my headset I could hear Chief call in; [‚ÄúBird says no pax visible on deck‚Äù]. 

If it was a raid several days ago, they‚Äôre long gone‚Ä¶ if they‚Äôre still here, they‚Äôre likely to be held up inside to avoid superior firepower. I drew my pistol as I got to the top, my glove death gripping the metal ledge as I pulled myself up, quickly transitioning to my 416 as fast as I could. I got that laser up, safe under my nods hoping it would give me some sort of advantage. You think that‚Äôs what old school sailors said, harpoon in hand before meeting the kraken? I quickly dragged the second guy up and we stood back to back, 180 degrees of security on both sides as the waves bobbed‚Ä¶ Something wasn‚Äôt right. Even if it had been several days under harsh winds, to arrive on a ship that is dead empty and silent meant death‚Ä¶ or worse. 

Soon a bunch of us stacked up against one of those containers, Daughtery and another took one group as I took another; [‚ÄúSecure top deck‚Äù] came through the headset, crackling from the moisture. It‚Äôs all we needed though, I quickly learned my condition wasn‚Äôt the only case as those next to me were all too ready to get going. We pied each corner, some pushed long down the side of the ship as I continued to cut through the middle rows of containers as we looked. Any of the shadows could contain an enemy, an AK prepped, safety off, waiting to dump a magazine into any of us, that thought kept adrenaline high. Despite this: no bodies, no life, nothing‚Ä¶ Soon as I cut to the starboard side, slight movement to my right caused me to raise my barrel, my peq laser met another. 

[‚ÄúBlue Starboard‚Äù] is what we quickly called in, Chief‚Äôs zodiac linked up with ours. Murphy himself was the one to link up with me as our combined force pushed towards the front of the ship. He used the headset since attempting to hear with the crashing waves was nearly impossible [‚ÄúAny OPFOR or crew?‚Äù]. 

[‚ÄúNegative‚Äù]. 


Then one of the team leads on my craft called in [‚Äúreached the front of the vessel, located forward antenna, completely inoperable‚Äù]. Chief and I made our way there as the middle portions of containers were slowly, deliberately cleared, all of us slipping, attempting to keep our balance on the dark vessel. At the base of the front antenna tower between two stacks of containers that creaked and groaned with the shifting of the dead ship, the console was‚Ä¶ completely gone. For reference it would‚Äôve been the redundant backup to assist long range communications incase there was a malfunction, the system itself weighed nearly 500lbs and should‚Äôve been bolted down‚Ä¶ ‚Äúshould‚Äôve‚Äù. It was gone‚Ä¶ broken metal under the bolts meant it wasn‚Äôt unfastened‚Ä¶ it was pulled off. 

I looked to Chief who just stared at the spot, his hand moving to his PTT: [‚Äú7 to 6‚Äù]. 

Daughtery responded [‚ÄúGo for 6‚Äù].

[‚ÄúForward communication system has been pulled off, no sign of it‚Äù]. 

There was a pause as the Platoon Commander came through in response: [‚ÄúSay again last‚Ä¶ you said ‚Äòpulled off‚Äô?‚Äù]. The bafflement in his voice mirrored our own; [‚ÄúCorrect‚Ä¶ bolts still on deck‚Ä¶‚Äù]. Chief then leaned down, on a particularly large piece that had a jagged edge, I could see some sort of substance. I kneeled down with him, it was strangely congealed, like blood but‚Ä¶ not, we‚Äôll get to that later. Strangely the water splashing all around it didn‚Äôt seem to move it one single bit, like it repelled it. 

Daughter answered back at this point: [‚ÄúCopy‚Ä¶ 7 leave a small unit to maintain presence on deck with bird support, bring the rest of the unit to me, we‚Äôve found an entry point, how copy?‚Äù]. 

Chief shot up, flicking it off his mechanix glove [‚ÄúRoger, enroute‚Äù]. 

Four were left to keep a watch on the deck as the rest of us hustled, as best as we could over a slick deck, towards the main tower at the stern of the ship. We had captured the deck, ready to move in and yet I wasn‚Äôt locked in at all‚Ä¶ I seemed to space out, my attention drawn to the waves. That‚Äôs where I kept feeling sized up from, since I grabbed that ladder‚Ä¶ and underneath the crashing sound I could hear talking. It was indecipherable, if you put a gun to my head right now and told me what was said, I‚Äôd tell you to pull the trigger cause I do not know. It was‚Ä¶ welcoming however, that‚Äôs the worst part, like it wanted to pull my gaze and I don‚Äôt know why. I shook my head and focused on anything else, the cold, the moisture, the exhaustion and heat inside of the MAS suit‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what knocked it off. 

We got to the entry point where the commander had his force stacked up, approaching the hinge side we could see it: a large bulkhead door that was swinging freely, unable to relatch or become secure as it had been mangled. So‚Ä¶ coming from an experienced breacher, they‚Äôll leave marks, obviously. Pry bars and sledges will make obvious impacts, welds and thermite will of course melt the metal‚Ä¶ the doorlock wheel, the edge of this 3 inch thick door was bent. Not from an invasive tool but from sheer force, the paint wasn‚Äôt even chipped, not a single bit. The solid metal of the wheel as well had been bent like it was taffy, like you left plastic in the sun for too long and it melted and bent under it‚Äôs own weight. Standing there in the rain assessing this‚Ä¶ it was uncanny. 

That‚Äôs how a lot of this felt: unnatural, variables that shouldn‚Äôt exist, dread that came from a situation where we knew none of us had ever been. That‚Äôs the human instinct I mentioned earlier, in territory you don‚Äôt understand, with something you‚Äôre not made to fight. Yet‚Ä¶ here we were. Chief signaled a breach, and we pushed in, a team went in first and it was now or never. 

We pushed in, two barrels leading as one of our guys had to pretty much shoulder check the door open to prevent the 200lb hunk of metal from taking out any of our shins, due to the damage it was free swinging. With the ghostly absence outside, you could be forgiven for forgetting about the remnants of the overtake, the gunfire in the radio transmission- I did. Once we poured in it all came rushing back. Metal furniture was destroyed, far more than any rocking of a ship could do, counters were cracked as signs of a struggle were clear as we secured what was a large common room area. No signs of gunfire, no brass or impact holes, yet blood smeared the floor‚Ä¶ red, and it led out into the hall. I stacked up with one of my platoon members, I squeezed his shoulder, adrenaline skyrocketed as we pushed into the hall‚Ä¶ 

It‚Äôs one of the most definite ways to die in close quarters combat and yet‚Ä¶. Nothing. 

Doors, some open, others closed greeted us as we controlled and I stuck to the right side. Our lasers centered on someone, a body‚Ä¶ slumped at the end of the hall with something protruding from their stomach‚Ä¶ under nods I couldn‚Äôt get a good look from our end. Our guys quickly followed us in as we split up, searching the different rooms shouting; ‚ÄúAmericans entering!!‚Äù, ‚ÄúMake yourself known!!‚Äù. The purpose of a VBSS isn‚Äôt extermination, it‚Äôs boarding and rescuing, even when fighting combatants we‚Äôre told to unironically ‚Äúshoot to wound‚Äù so we can capture them for intel. 

Nothing. Nothing but that body looking at me as our guys poured down each room as I and the man on my left kept security forward as we slowly inched with every advance our guys made to the left and right. Soon‚Ä¶ we reached it: It was a smaller man, slumped forward with his whole throat just‚Ä¶. Let me put it this way, I could see his spinal cord from where I was standing. His eyes were punctured, still there as I could see the chunks of what was left but something had stabbed deep into them. The ‚Äúobject‚Äù I said earlier made itself known, some sort of spear-like implement that at a first glance looked like petrified wood, or something to that nature, as white and enigmatic as marble but much more coarse. I motioned for him to cover me, he kept his 416 trained on the man as I searched him‚Ä¶ a grey polo with ‚ÄúZephyr Evo‚Äù on the right side chest was embroidered, and the thing had gone clean through his sternum and was inside the wall behind him. 

As our guys searched this area, I heard over comms; [‚ÄúGot 2 KIA in here‚Äù]. 

[‚Äú3 bodies in here‚Äù]. 

Some of them crew, others the ‚ÄúZephyr‚Äù personnel, all seemingly killed and left to rot‚Ä¶ boy did it fuckin‚Äô smell. It didn‚Äôt hit until after the adrenaline wore off a bit but it wreaked, combined with the moisture and some of the bodies had bloated. 

We pushed upstairs, clearing out latrines and other rooms, and found some more dead in similar condition, but no signs of fighting. We reached the bridge around 0250, forcing open the door we quickly got our points of domination and focused barrels on the center. Not much was destroyed, except for the wheel of the ship which had been half torn off the mount, and the communications console was completely caved in‚Ä¶ a substance coating it, similar to the one found on the front comms. Chief noticed and as we were inside, we took a white light to it: dark blue, almost looking like paint with a reflective inside, it was gelatin to the point of high density. Droplets led from an angled part of the broken comms unit out of the room. 

One of our guys asked ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ some sort of coolant?‚Äù. 

Chief wiped it off on the edge of a counter ‚ÄúNothing that I had seen‚Äù. 

Suddenly from below [‚ÄúA-2 to A-7, I‚Äôve got confirmed movement below‚Äù]. The speed in which we took off down those stairs would rival usain bolt, many of us breaking safety and skipping steps as we stacked up alongside our second squad. Chief quickly moved in behind; ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you see?‚Äù. 

‚ÄúA-2‚Äù, the E-5 leading second squad kept watch down the stairwell with his men as he whispered: ‚ÄúSomething moved out‚Ä¶ think it was one of the attackers as they didn‚Äôt respond to our call outs. It took one look at us and I could see their eyes shine before they rushed to the left side of the hall through the middle door‚Äù. Chief around the corner to where our lasers scanned, Captain Daughtery clarified: ‚Äúreflected‚Ä¶ IR?‚Äù. 

A-2 shook his head ‚ÄúNo, didn‚Äôt give off an IR shine‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think I need to state this‚Ä¶ but people‚Äôs eyes don‚Äôt shine, and if it didn‚Äôt give off an IR reflection‚Ä¶ the PL got on comms: [‚ÄúOpfor possibly located, signs of peq and nod usage. Proceed with caution‚Äù]. From here on out‚Ä¶ we limited our lasers and tightened up discipline‚Ä¶ we carefully moved down in a split stacked straight into the hallway, approaching the first set of opposing doors as four men poured into each side. As we moved forward and they called ‚Äúroom clear!!‚Äù... we heard it. 

The silence was broken, causing a visible jump in all of us: a shrill growl, like that of a hiss but with major reverb behind it, came from our front left‚Ä¶ a huge amount of thrashing came as we could hear it flipping furniture and cabinets before moving back further towards the stern. I say cabinets specifically‚Ä¶ because one tipped and came flying out into the hall and laid across it.

[‚ÄúOPFOR located, 10 O‚Äôclock, maneuver!!‚Äù] Chief ordered as I and a few others moved into that left room. What greeted us was a commons and sleeping quarters than had a torn up couch gutted, yet‚Ä¶ no figure. As we scanned the same substance from before could be seen drenching the floor before heading to the back. We moved towards the door and continued to see it and the hallway connected to a large back storage area. We scanned the room with our lasers, lassoing with others from the main hallway and what I believe was the rooms on the right before signaling a joint entry. 

All of us pushed in, quickly clearing under desks and in between shelves, a labyrinth between us and whoever else was in here. So many of us had to switch to pistols for better aim, I had to. My sidearm was a P226 MK25, a reliable weapon, luckily the surefire attachment had an IR flood along with its normal flashlight. I took the lead as I squeezed between shelves‚Ä¶ following the trail like bread crumbs as I could hear our guys on the other side move as well. 

[‚ÄúSee anything?‚Äù]. 

[‚ÄúNegative, continuing search‚Äù]. 

[‚ÄúStay sharp, there‚Äôs so much fuckin‚Äô dead space‚Äù]. 

I managed to squeeze my 200lb ass through enough to search‚Ä¶ The trail ended through a pile of collapsed chairs‚Ä¶ as I followed it and scanned towards my front‚Ä¶ 


A set of black, deep sea eyes greeted me, a smooth form with a bump where I would‚Äôve gauged its nose was, a mandible that hung open with hundreds of razor thin teeth, and hideous gill flaps underneath it. It lurked between an opening, sizing me up as it stood a head taller than me, lumpy skin with periodic spikes, frills that made my skin crawl, and webbing between it‚Äôs all too long fingers and feet. The thing paused, a large wound where it‚Äôs shoulder was as the substance leaked out of it like molasses. I stood there, my throat clenched in fear as my barrel shook slightly‚Ä¶ 

I was staring into the eyes of something that was more ancient than the trident I endured so much hell for and to serve with. It could tell, as its flaps and gills seemed to twitch‚Ä¶ it roared, the shrill yell from before was much louder‚Ä¶ at the center what sounded like a man yet‚Ä¶ drowned out by a high pitched whine that made my ears ring. I cringed as it lept, my barrel aiming as it was all too quick, its jaw seemingly opening even wider as it slashed and its arm dragged a whole cabinet with it. Its razor thin claws got stuck in the nylon of my plate carrier, my finger pulled the trigger and began to fire off shots. Rounds impacted the chest and I could see a splash and yet it kept staring. It thrashed, lunging forward as its claws made contact with my skin, I cringed as it pulled a whole damn cabinet down with it and onto me. 

Meanwhile, my headset was going off the chain; [‚Äúwhat was that?!‚Äù]. 

[‚ÄúWho‚Äôs letting rounds loose?!‚Äù]. 

As my backplate hit the ground, I stomped down and took out one of its legs, much thinner than my own, as my off hand grabbed it‚Äôs shoulder and pushed it off. I felt its claws slide out of me‚Ä¶ a feeling that chills me now while I‚Äôm writing this report. The thing bit down and gnawed on my nightvision and I got an all too visceral look at it‚Äôs throat: thorny spikes that looked like the esophagus of a leviathan lined a scaly interior, behind those hundreds of teeth were rows of dozens more, all chewing on my 50 grand quads that were protecting my head more than my helmet was. 

That‚Äôs when I could only describe as an IR flood from the others bathe the creature, a setting on the peq laser that acts like a flashlight for night vision. With me and the thing intrinsically coiled together, I tried to kick it away, only for it to use me as a launch pad. It slashed my right arm, adding to the puncture in my left shoulder, and one of it‚Äôs spiked feet tore through my pants opening up a gash on my thigh. I rolled to my side, messily pulling my sidearm to see it close the distance with my boys, with all of us so close together they couldn‚Äôt just let loose or they‚Äôd risk catastrophic fratricide. Somehow even with what I then knew was it‚Äôs blood gushing all over, it took several rifle rounds, one of it‚Äôs hand slashing across the front of Daughtery‚Äôs plate carrier, his front plate saving him even as he slipped back from the force into several others. Despite this the captain roared as he cracked off several rounds, visibly tearing into the thing‚Äôs ribs.

I pushed myself up, my body screaming in pain as I fumbled to slam my glock back into it‚Äôs holster. I shakily held my rifle, adrenaline being the only thing allowing me to move operationally as we pursued. 

Chief lit up comms with [‚ÄúOpfor sighted!!! One making a run for the deck!!! Cut off entry point!!‚Äù]. 

The distant sound of the open door above being closed, leaving us in contained silence as we all slowly pied the corners. Chief and I, and several others carefully maneuvered through, my nods scratched to all hell but I kept going. ‚ÄúYou good, Spears?‚Äù Chief asked, truthfully? I felt like I just hugged a woodchipper, but I wasn‚Äôt going to tell him that. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good‚Äù. 

Soon we heard it‚Ä¶ calling out, the same way an animal does to its pack when it‚Äôs cornered‚Ä¶ elongated, desperate cries from deep within the bowls. We moved forward towards the front, ducking below pipes and equipment, our lasers scanning every cover point until we got to one of the lowest points, we opened a bulkhead and a foot of water came sloshing out. Chief quickly warned; [‚ÄúThis is 7, we‚Äôve got a possible integrity breach near middle hoppers-‚Äù]. 

Was it trying to make an escape? Did it escape? 

We pushed through, our movement no longer secret from the breaking of water, still‚Ä¶ as we turned a corner, against a metal wall we could see it‚Ä¶ it had one of the fucking 2 inch thick metal floor plates peeled back at the corner like a damn can. It was trying to escape, trying to very literally crawl into the hopper. As it turned to look, it truly looked like something that crawled out of the deep‚Ä¶. Even if the water was just a foot deep, it seemed to move faster when it withdrew and faced us, the sludge it was bleeding floated atop the water. 

I made a low growl, knowing it was cornered‚Ä¶ and then moved towards us, sliding unnaturally fast through the water as I could see its claws. We opened up, fuck shoot to wound, we were shooting to survive. All of us backed up, my back hit the wall as I could feel my wounds sting, as myself, Chief, and several others quickly shot into that thing. Holes opened up, more of its blood leaked out, I could see its jaws open up and it growed‚Ä¶ a round shattered its jaw, another through its face. Then‚Ä¶. It grew still. The ship rocked as we all stood there, taking in the situation as Chief quickly took control: [‚Äú7 to 6, Opfor is down, securing hoppers‚Äù]. 

From there, seizing of all materials and evidence was had, along with consolidation of any and all casualties to be collected by higher authorities. Surprisingly‚Ä¶ there weren‚Äôt many others, Daughtery‚Äôs carrier protected him, I got the worst of it‚Ä¶ second to one of our guys on deck. It was during the fiasco, down to the second I had seen it‚Ä¶ According to his second on his side of the ship, he stopped and just stared out at the waves. The only thing he said was: ‚ÄúYou hear it?‚Äù. 

Transcript provided read‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù A-3A asks A-3S as he seems to stop, flicking up his nods as he stared into the darkness and took a step forward. A-3A, now thoroughly freaked out, visibly cocked his head and asked; ‚ÄúHey, you alright? The fuck you hear?‚Äù. A-3S then‚Ä¶ according to the ISR footage from the bird, tore off his IR stobe on his helmet, and walked off the side of the deck into the ocean. A-3S immediately yelled into comms: [‚ÄúOverboard!!! A-3S is Overboard!!!!‚Äù]. 

56 hours of search and recovery provided no information as to what happened to him, only evidence of him was one of his boots‚Ä¶ found over 1,000 nautical miles at a port in Tirua, Chile, a distance impossible for any simple drift within that time frame. How did they know it was his? One of his teeth was found inside, dental records matched. Officially he was lost during the VBSS initial boarding, in reality‚Ä¶ something coerced him in. 

We were all kinds of torn up, unsure as to what had gone on however we finally got an extended AAR 3 days later. In the interim I had been given a serious amount of stitches, enough military grade fentanyl to make me forget I was cut open like a deli, and we were all brought to a much more classy FOB in the central pacific. The state department rep from before greeted us, this time in jeans, a polo, slicked back hair‚Ä¶ he walked in and set down a stack of folders, telling us; ‚ÄúTake one pass it left‚Ä¶ Gentlemen I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre all aware of what you saw on the Amity?‚Äù. 

Chief chuckled, quipping back ‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôre supposed to say nothing? Maybe a pirate? That‚Äôs what killed one of our guys and slashed up another?‚Äù. He patted my good soldier, the state rep instead lit a cigarette; ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. 

This caught Chief off guard, I could tell because of the silence and single eyebrow raise, very rarely is he ever there. He flipped open one of the folders; ‚ÄúPage 5‚Äù, we did‚Ä¶ it was an autopsy report. I could see it in it‚Äôs full detail, a dark blue color, the layers of flesh and some skeleton that looked like a cross between a neanderthal and a frog. ‚ÄúWhat you encountered aboard the Amity is known within the community as Populus Aqua, current origins are theories based off cryptozoology with none yet being proven as concrete. Many different subspecies exist, one of which being qui tenebrosa aqua: ‚ÄòPeople of the Dark Water‚Äô... that‚Äôs what you found aboard that dutch ship‚Äù. 

The absolute certainty of what he was saying, even as we were seeing what looked like images from some shitty sci-fi movie was‚Ä¶ surreal. I knew it was real, hell it made me bleed, took another one of our guys, it had to be real. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶..‚Äù one of our gunners who was sitting near the back, awkwardly eyeing the picture of the cut open sea demon, back to the man: ‚Äú... Mermaids?‚Äù. 

‚ÄúIn the popular modern sense? No, in fact it‚Äôs debated if they‚Äôre even related to humans besides their pipedal usage of hips and similar limbs. These things predate written history and are seen on ancient carvings everywhere from Jerusalem to New Zealand‚Äù he said, he flipped a few pages; ‚Äúcheck page 11 if you want more on that‚Äù. 

‚ÄúWhat was their intent for this? There‚Äôs got to be some follow up or we would be told to keep calm and not talk about it‚Äù Daughtery said, leaning forward on the table. The man nodded ‚Äúcorrect, you would be‚Ä¶ the attack lines up with several others that have occurred within the last few months, all from this species. They would usually remain below crush depth, as seen by their physiology, but they‚Äôve not only come to the surface but are attacking ships. You are the first operational unit to encounter them and confirm their existence‚Äù. 

Chief leaned back ‚ÄúSo you know what we were getting into and gave us the narcos schtick?‚Äù. The man however didn‚Äôt relent ‚ÄúI had a theory, I sent you in there with the most actionable intel, you found an anomaly, Chief Shane Murphy. What happens now is up to the intestinal fortitude of you and your men‚Äù. 

‚ÄúThat being?‚Äù the captain asked. 

‚ÄúWe believe now that we know the species and a fresh example of how they attack ships, we can better coordinate and anticipate their next moves. Your unit is the most experienced having not only encountered but killed one. Some losses, yes-‚Äù he said, Chief didn‚Äôt like that as he sat forward. ‚ÄúSome? That was one of my fucking men‚Äù. 

The man fired back: ‚ÄúYes, one of several hundred that have been claimed and written off as storm casualties. You want to curve that number? You‚Äôre being assigned under me to help hunt down and stop these intrusions. Together, we are going to close the distance and get to the bottom of this‚Äù he said, taking a long drag. This is when I finally spoke up: ‚ÄúWho might you be?‚Äù. 

‚ÄúSpecial Agent ‚ÄòMiller‚Äô...‚Äù he said, locking eyes with me, the cold dead stare of a man who‚Äôs done more than a few questionable things for his country. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm part of a special joint task force, working name is ‚ÄòPexu‚Äô, no dossier, consider it like an Omega Deployment for the guys here who‚Äôve been around the block. I‚Äôve been assigned to see the violent conclusion of the qui tenebrosa aqua‚Äù. The pages of this file are lined with reports, missing people dragged to the depths, others torn to shreds with the autopsies all matching the same thing that nearly gut me.

‚ÄúDo we have an easier name?‚Äù one of the other squad leads asked. 

Miller rolled his eyes; ‚ÄúCommon term is ‚ÄòMermen‚Äô, however the moniker used everywhere from Mexico to Turkey is ‚ÄòSirens‚Äô‚Ä¶ two of the first written examples credited to the Irish and Greeks. Gentlemen it may seem fantastical, but the reality is anything but, in the 1970s a british military sub was nearly downed by a group of these, see page 18‚Ä¶‚Äù. Truth be told, I did ‚ÄòHMS Dreadnought S101‚Äô, severe damage that ruptured the body. If they could do this‚Ä¶ 

Daughtery was taken aback as he inquired ‚ÄúSo what‚Ä¶ they did this with their hands?‚Äù. 

Miller shook his head ‚ÄúNo, weapons similar to those found in your raid‚Ä¶ Page 6‚Äù. I flipped back to see the same spear that was stuck in the man, a full image with notes. I could hear Miller detail ‚Äúwhale bone, carved and fine tuned. You know how tough whale bone is captain?‚Äù. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôd say very tough‚Äù. 

‚ÄúWith the right force behind it, it could puncture steel. So‚Ä¶ is everyone taking this seriously?‚Äù the agent asked. The silent of 2 dozen seals all staring intently was his answer and the respect he wanted. ‚ÄúGood‚Ä¶ get some rest, don‚Äôt wander too far‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve got another objective, I‚Äôll be in touch‚Äù. With that‚Ä¶ he just picked up his file and walked out, leaving us to grieve and our minds to wonder about the future. 

We‚Äôve been convening amongst ourselves, this is completely out of the realm of anything we‚Äôve experienced but‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre marching head first together. I‚Äôve been tasked to keep this log updated until the conclusion or until my untimely demise. 

I‚Äôll be back with more soon.

1k9lr8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k9lr8p/situationship_advice_needed/,Situationship??? Advice needed,"\*sigh\* This is going to be a really long one. Just bear with me, it's at least 3-4 months of BS.

I male \[24\] are in a situationship that's fucking with my mental health so bad because of other deeply rooted issues I have not worked through yet.

I was in a 4-year relationship with my ex, but things started to take a turn around October of last year. I was falling out of love with her because I was unsatisfied with the 20% I was fixated on. In hindsight I could have done a better job at communicating and doing more myself, but she did things that made me start looking at the 20%. 1. She was very insecure, 2. She did not take job opportunities that I gave her, 3. Sexually the intimacy became less and less on both our parts. Little things started to add up on both sides that caused a rift. I eventually made the decision to break up with her in February because it came to its finale. It wasn't a good breakup, but we have since made up and talked it out and forgave each other. She is still my best friend, and we still talk but don't have any intention to get back together anytime soon. We were highly compatible, just not ready yet. She was my first love and I'm glad she was. I was her third boyfriend.

Around October we got a new batch of workers at the place I work, and I was training some of them. One of them was another woman who is the same age as me. We can call her Amber \[24\]. Amber is super attractive totally my type physically. I was still with my ex at the time but was always faithful to her. I had approached Amber and introduced myself to her and offered to train her/help her out with any questions work related. (Something I never do is introduce myself to women let alone go out of my way to do so). She was very sweet and friendly at the time and had me write my number down in her notebook since she didn't have a phone at the time. As the months would go on, I saw her around more often especially down where I work, and we would briefly chat about work and simple things like her hair or how the weekend was for us. Nothing ever lasted more than 5-10 minutes. Sometimes a simple hi and bye. However, I noticed in one particular conversation she had stopped me by the elevators and asked me to help her check her hours on the system. While talking to her, she is smiling intently at me, batting her eyes, playing with her hair, and even being somewhat playful in the conversation. She knew I was taken because somehow it made its way in the conversation and previous ones. But I started to feel that this girl Amber had a crush on me. And I was right or at least I thought so.

Fast forward to February, I run into a mutual friend/coworker of Amber's and I in the hallway. We can call her Joan \[35\]. Joan stopped me in the hallway and out of nowhere asked how things were going with my ex. I responded that it ok, but that we are going through some stuff. She then said, ""Oh okay, I can't tell you anything then."" I just laughed and said, ""What I got a secret admirer?"" She nodded yes and said so. Thats when the fucking gears in my head started to turn because earlier that day Joan and Amber came down to where I worked hours earlier and Joan said, ""Hey, don't you think my friend Amber looks cute?"" I said, ""Yeah, I like her hair too, but I think I think Josh looks cuter (Josh is a random male coworker that was working with me at the time). They just laughed, and I quickly walked away not thinking much of it. But, after Joan had told me that upstairs, I immediately got flustered and left. I called another mutual friend of mine and Amber's up to get his opinion. We can call him Henry \[41\]. Henry has given her rides home because he and her live in the same direction. He told me that one night Amber started talking about me and said that ""Your boy \[my name\] can get it"". This was apparently back in October which is when we first started being introduced through small run ins at our job. I was like holy fuck this is tight. But then, I started thinking about my ex and was like nah I can't do that no matter how much we are struggling right now. 15 minutes after Henry and I had that conversation Amber texts me out of nowhere, I did not have her number, but she had mine since October. She came hot and heavy out the gates calling me cute and that she's been looking for me all day and that she wants my help with ""something"". She sent me a photo of herself in the elevator nothing lewd but asks for one back of me. (So, I send one). She starts again with the compliments, and I call her cute as well. Shortly after meeting up with her, we get to talking and she's sharing stuff about her to me. She tells me she has a kid, that she rents an apartment alone with her mom and sister and tells me some personal details about the sister she lost a few years back. So naturally I share stuff about myself back. But as the hour approaches, she tells me that she knows I have a girlfriend, and she is going to respectfully take a step back and that she just wanted to tell me how she felt. I was thankful that she did that, and I told her that I am flattered but that I want to keep my peace and not complicate things.

Needless to say, I sat with this for a couple days. I decided to break things off with my ex and I won't lie. A big reason was because of Amber. I wanted to pursue someone new and try new pussy. Yeah, I was unhappy and so was my ex. It would have gotten worst and reached a new boiling point at some time in the near future. So, I said fuck it. Little did I know how much I was going to be hurting despite me doing the breaking up. My ex ended moving back home and I approached Amber a week later and told her what transpired. I was honest with her. I told her, ""I like you, I am attracted to you, and I want to pursue you. But I also want to be truthful with you. I just got out of a 4-year relationship and I'm hurting. I don't want us to move fast, and I don't want to use you as a rebound. I want to build up a friendship with you first. We both work here and the last thing I want is for us not to work out and make things uncomfortable and disrupt each other's peace. We both have a lot going on and you have a child to take care of. With that being said, I would like for us to make time for each other and spend time together outside of work when we can. I want to get to know you and build up something up with you. I don't play with people's emotions because people can get hurt badly that way."" She agreed and told me that I need to heal first and that she'll be there for me. She continued to love-bomb me and follow me at work to the point where other coworkers started noticing it and even a manager called it out by calling us ""love birds"". Naturally, she was making me feel good while I was hurting, I didn't really fully process the breakup yet. She would call me almost every morning, leave me hearts in the messages and text me consistently for weeks. But out of nowhere she pulled back suddenly. Calls became less frequent to now none, text messages became hours apart sometimes never responding back. This made me spiral in my head thinking ""Was this a game to her?"" I thought we were on the same page. She told me she hasn't dated in 3 years. That she has only had 3 relationships (all of which ended with her being cheated on). She told me she valued consistency and honesty. That communication was not her strong suit and that she hates texting and would rather call. I would ask her out for coffee, or dinner, or even a hike since she told me she likes the outdoors. Not once have we hung out since February. I took it as her being busy since she's a mom and the only breadwinner in her household. But I would sometimes see her stories on IG, and she would be out with friends or chilling at home. Not just that, but as texts became less frequent and response times super long, we would take lunch together and she would be glued to her phone while I'm trying to talk with her. Calling people, texting people back and looking at memes. Mutual friends/co-workers would tell that she really likes me and cares for me. That she would be smiling texting me in the girls locker-room.

I started to take a step back when I saw that. And it hurt because here I am finding myself in a situation that isn't what I thought it was. I got my hopes up about her because she was very sweet in the beginning. She love bombed me, made plans that never came to be, had all these strong qualities I liked, told me she wanted to move slow, and of course our mutual friends told me that she likes and cares for me. I mean ffs she shared what her goals and future plans are and that she wanted to go in the same field as me so I even took her to my college so she could apply. Nonetheless, I started to question everything and her intentions even my own self-worth because I put her on a pedestal.

Last month on March (28th) I messaged her friend Joan asking if she can give me advice about where Amber's headspace was at since they are close. I Told Joan that I liked Amber etc. etc. she's amazing, but I don't want to hurt myself emotionally if she's not ready. Joan promised to get back to me which she never did till I reached out two weeks later. I want to say on April 1st. Before reaching out to her, I gave Amber the benefit of the doubt because I drove her home one night (second to last week of march), and she argued with her family about her child being up and it got pretty heated since her mom and sister don't work, and they don't want to watch her kid while she's out all day working for the most part. Then baby daddy does petty shit to bother her like take her car seats without asking when he has custody on certain weeks. So, I just let her vent to me and comforted her. I let her know that she can talk to me and I'm ready for her when she is. I felt that we were in a good place right there because I saw a side of her that I haven't seen and that she has real shit going on. I slowed my brain down and it gave me clarity. Mind you I have tried asking her about this stuff, but she doesn't like to share with me, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt because of her hard upbringing struggling with homelessness, neglect from her parents, and bad relationships. Also, I heard a rumor from the guy Joan was fucking at the time that apparently Amber was crying about me. Saying that she likes me but doesn't know what she wants and that she's emotionally not ready. (Joan had told this guy she was fucking and that guy told me) However, things took a turn. I noticed at one point Ambers IG story and highlights stopped appearing on my page which is strange because they were always there, and she was active on social media. I had a feeling she restricted me, and I was right. During lunch one night, she opened her phone next to me and clicked on her story and shit began playing, she quickly closed it, and I think she noticed that I noticed. I took her home that night like nothing happened, and I just stepped back even more. At this point that rubbed me the wrong way and made me question everything again. I stopped taking her home after that.

Shortly after that night, she called out of work for about a week. I messaged her letting her know that I hope she's okay and that I'm here if she needs someone to lean on or go out for a coffee. I never heard from her. This is when Joan got back to me on April 1st. Joan told me that Amber was vague on the response and that she was dealing with a lot and that she was not emotionally ready for anything. She apologized to me for setting us up at the time and that she was sorry for any pain caused. I had my clarity and kept it pushing. I told Joan that I wasn't upset and that I hope Amber gets through what she's going through and that I will see them around at work. The next day on April 2nd Amber texts me late at 10PM just an hour before our shift is over and she is fucking fuming. Saying she's hearing shit from other people about how I feel about her among other bullshit. That I didn't tell her I was working the same day as her. (Idk why she put that, we have never shared every time one of us was working. Sometimes I didn't know she was working the same shift as me and I would not know until the night was done at clock out) She continued to text me that she goes through a lot mentally and no one knows how she feels. She came at me sideways like if I was her dude. I was like ""Woah, what the fuck?"" I offered to talk in person since she apparently hates texting, and I wanted to clear the air and get things off my chest and understand why she felt the way she did. Hopefully even set boundaries and see what this was. She didn't want to talk that night, so I offered to take her out for coffee next week on Monday which she agreed too. I checked in with her Sunday morning and she never responded to me until 8PM asking what time. She told me she was at the aquarium with her kid. Needless to say, the coffee didn't happen, and she stood me up. At this point I've done tooooo much. But it didn't sit well with me and I gave her the benefit of the doubt again. I called her Monday around the time we were supposed to go, and she told me that she still wants to meet up but that she has her kid and is calling her mom to watch her child. I asked her to keep me updated and that I would still be willing to pick her up and meet. She never got back to me or even apologized. She was out of work for a whole week with the flu, doctors note and everything. I ended up unfollowing her on Instagram because of the whole restriction thing and how she stood me up. There has been zero communication on her part. Funny enough before I unfollowed her, she was commenting under reels the same day she sent me that angry message to me. For context the post said, ""When he stops texting you good morning and calling you, so you know your free trial is over"". She commented under that post saying, ""He doesn't care about me anymore"" and then a day after saying ""He still cares about me guys stop liking the comment"" (at this point I don't think I'm the only guy she was talking to)

The kicker is she wanted to talk about this in person when I offered and agreed to meet for coffee yet stands me up with no explanation. It gets better, she hits me up a week after she recovers and tells me her work schedule. Once again, no apology or explanation. I end up seeing her Friday before I leave home, and she tells me to have a goodnight and sorry we didn't get to talk in person today. (She was texting me Friday If I was going to be working).

At this point I don't believe I'm going to get the clarity I need from the talk she agreed to have after she sent me that message. I'm wondering if she's just really damaged or manipulative or both.

As far as I know from what I have seen/felt:

1. She lovedbombed me at the start \[I'm not familiar with dating out there or know what it's like. I've been in one solid relationship\]
2. It felt like she began breadcrumbing me with the super late texts and hitting me up randomly when I would not text her back and would say things like ""We should go hiking,"" I'm like cool let me know when you're available.
3. She is very bad at communication and seems to avoid ""confrontations"" despite agreeing to have them
4. Her actions aren't lying up with her words
5. Mixed signals
6. Has not made an effort to hang out or get to know me
7. Restricted off IG for whatever reason
8. Is telling other people she cares and likes me but hasn't told me herself??? (unless its all lies)
9. If two people like each other, it's never this difficult and communication is the bare minimum, time will be made in anyway so that two people can see each other and spend time with one another

9b. One night I was taking her home and she said, ""I don't like you having to give me a ride because I live so far away,"" I responded back, ""I like taking you home because I get to spend more time with you and hearing you sing"" (we would do karaoke in the car). Her response? Not a damn thing. Either she felt flustered by it or maybe didn't really care. It's whatever at this point

Is this what its like meeting people and trying to bond with them in 2025??? Am I the crazy one?

I'm looking for advice and peoples input anything helps. I am stressed out my fucking mind especially with the unfinished ""talk"" about why she sent me that. It is causing me a bunch of emotional distress to the point where it has fucked with my peace. I have no problems in life, no real responsibility. I work, go to school, hit the gym, and take myself out from time to time. I was fine sharing my peace with someone so long as they reciprocated the same amount of energy and feelings back regardless of what they have going on. Why is it so hard for people to be honest and communicate especially if that's what you say you wanted? I never asked for anything, and I was upfront about my intentions.

-JAMES HARPER-

In the heart of Foundry Hills, corruption and deceit governed the land. Skyscrapers clawed at the sky, each straining higher for dominance over the concrete jungle. Foundries surrounded the town, expelling thick, toxic plumes that blanketed the population below. Pedestrians rushed along, indifferent to one another, dodging vehicles that tore through intersections with horns blaring, each driver consumed by their own desires. Here, humanity had bartered away its soul for a slim chance at success, with odds near impossible.

To the northwest stood Warren Court, beneath a canopy of dark clouds drifting in from the industrial district. Cloaked in shadow, this neighborhood held a peaceful stillness, untouched by the city‚Äôs sins. James Harper‚Äôs home was here, filled with memories that served as a rare refuge‚Äîa flicker of peace against the chaos taunting its border.

Harper retrieved his glasses from the sink counter, wiping the lenses to restore clarity to his blue-eyed view of the world. Rain hammered against the bathroom windows, its rhythmic pounding a percussion backdrop to the muffled voices drifting in from the hallway.

Suddenly, the house plunged into darkness.

‚ÄúHarp?‚Äù Denise‚Äôs voice called from the kitchen.

The lights flickered back on, the outage brief.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Denise, just another brownout,‚Äù Harper called back, his tone reassuring. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be out in a second.‚Äù

It was brief this time, at least, thought Harper. His fingers brushed against a small box as he reached into his hoodie pocket and pulled it out‚Äîa delicately wrapped package labeled For my love in elegant, golden script. A smile crept onto his face as he envisioned its contents: a gold necklace with an emerald pendant, chosen to match the sparkle of Denise's eyes, as he so vividly remembered from their first encounter. The emerald, though valuable, couldn‚Äôt compare to them. Today was the day he‚Äôd gift it‚Äîa symbol of the love they'd built over a decade.

Harper felt anxious and excited, picturing Denise's face when she saw it. He tucked the box back into his pocket, a hidden surprise that would be revealed in a couple of hours.

As he walked down the decorated hallway, lined with family photos, a flash of lightning illuminated their faces. Peering through the drapes, he watched the rain swell the nearby creek, spilling over into the garden beds.

Alice and James Jr. looked up as he entered the living room and made his way to the couch, their laughter spilling from the card game they were playing. They were great kids, always looking out for each other‚Äîsomething Harper never had growing up as an only child in a city as unforgiving as this one.

‚ÄúMmm, do you smell that, Junior?‚Äù Alice asked.

He nodded eagerly. ‚ÄúYup, our favorite on cold, rainy days‚Äîdelicious stew.‚Äù

The aroma of Denise‚Äôs family recipe, a hearty beef stew simmering with herbs and vegetables, filled the house. She covered the pot with a lid, then picked up a bowl of popcorn and joined them in the living room.

‚ÄúBeen your dad‚Äôs favorite for years,‚Äù she said, smiling down at them. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that right, Harp?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know it is,‚Äù Harper replied, inhaling the rich, comforting scent. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without your amazing cooking.‚Äù

Her smile widened as she set down the bowl and placed her hand on his. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be living on bland food, missing all the flavor I bring to your life,‚Äù she teased, her smile playful.

‚ÄúI love you, Denise,‚Äù he murmured.

‚ÄúI love you, Harp.‚Äù

They snuggled on the couch, listening to Moonlight Sonata drifting from the radio. Their eyes settled above the fireplace, on a photo taken at Rolling Peaks. It was the last family photo they took together, the four of them standing together, smiling in front of blooming red peonies.

Denise rested her head against Harper's chest. He breathed in deeply, catching the soft, floral scent of her red hair. On the tan carpet, Alice and James Jr. lay immersed in their game, their laughter weaving softly through the evening.

Harper felt at peace, his gaze drifting to the flames dancing in the fireplace, casting light and shadows across the room. His eyes closed for a moment‚Äîuntil the crack of gunfire shattered the silence, bullets ripping through the lock. The Harpers all turned toward the front door as splinters flew, a final gunshot blasting it from its hinges. A masked intruder in all black burst through, slamming the door open as the frame buckled under the force.

Two other armed gunmen rushed in behind the intruder, closing in from multiple angles. Harper shot up from the couch, heart pounding and adrenaline surging through him. He pivoted to face the threat as one of the intruders rounded the corner of the couch, weapon raised.

Before he could react, the pistol struck Harper‚Äôs temple with a sickening crack, sending him staggering back. He stumbled against the coffee table, then collapsed to his knees on the ground. Pain radiated through his skull, spreading like a thousand knives stabbing every nerve behind his eyes. His vision blurred, and the intruders‚Äô voices began to muffle as the edges of his consciousness slipped‚Äîuntil a scream tore through. Denise, no. I have to get up‚Äînow! he thought.

Her voice jolted him back to the scene, his left eye clouded by a thin trickle of blood from a cut above his brow. Harper touched the wound, keeping his one clear eye on the gunmen. Surrounded and outnumbered, he held back, trying to figure out their intentions.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù he demanded.

‚ÄúMoney?‚Äù the woman scoffed. ‚ÄúPlease, you couldn‚Äôt afford anything close to my worth. We‚Äôre simply fulfilling his request.‚Äù Her voice was chillingly calm as she stood slightly apart from the others, clearly in charge.

‚ÄúAnd what is that?‚Äù Harper‚Äôs fists clenched as he eyed her.

Her gaze drifted toward the window, landing on a photo on the end table. She lifted it, her gloved fingers brushing over the smiling faces. ‚ÄúA shame‚Ä¶ such a beautiful family‚Ä¶‚Äù

Harper guided Denise and the children behind him, drawing them close as he shielded his family as best he could. James Jr. whimpered, clutching his sister. The coffee table and sofa were all that stood between them and masked intruders, who held their guns pointing to the ground.

The woman‚Äôs gaze shifted to Denise, then down to the kids behind her legs. She sighed, setting the photo back on the table, then locked her gaze dead-set into Harper‚Äôs blue, desperate eyes. ‚ÄúKill the Harpers.‚Äù

Harper‚Äôs eyes dropped to the coffee table. He quickly grabbed the laptop and swung it hard, smacking the intruder across the face, sending him crashing to the floor, unconscious.

Another intruder approached, his weapon in hand but not yet aimed. Before he could raise it, Harper ducked, throwing his weight forward as he grabbed the gunman‚Äôs arm, wrestling to keep the barrel pointed away from Denise and the kids, who had shifted toward a corner. The intruder pushed back hard, forcing Harper‚Äôs shoulders into the mantel above the lit fireplace, knocking a set of fireplace tools clattering to the ground. Harper groaned, the intense heat from the fireplace searing against his back, making his clothes feel as if they were melting to his skin.

The intruder jerked his arm back, but Harper twisted his wrist, locking him into a firm Jiu-Jitsu hold. He angled the gunman‚Äôs arm upward and outward, forcing him into a position where aiming the weapon was impossible. A round fired, missing the coffee table and burying itself in the carpet.

Then, a second gunshot rang out, shattering the framed photo above the mantle inches from Harper‚Äôs face and sending glass fragments flying toward him.

They all looked back at the woman, her smoking barrel aimed at Harper.

Denise stepped forward, shoving the woman‚Äôs armed hand downward and clawing her nails across her skin, catching the edge of her eye. The woman didn‚Äôt flinch but, with a sharp, angry motion, struck Denise on the left side of her head with the butt of the gun.

Denise stumbled back, clutching her head. As she tried to recover, the woman yanked her red hair back, pressing the barrel of the weapon firmly against her temple.

‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù the woman barked, silencing the room. Her free hand brushed the fresh cut near the corner of her eye, smearing the blood as annoyance and a hint of admiration flashed across her face.

‚ÄúFeisty,‚Äù she muttered, pressing the barrel harder. Her lips twisted into a humorless smile. ‚ÄúI can respect that. Still, I pity it won‚Äôt save you‚Äîor them.‚Äù

Harper was too far to intervene, and any sudden move would risk Denise‚Äôs life‚Äîincluding his children‚Äôs. He forced himself to stay still, but the fury inside made him shake with the urge to explode.

‚ÄúPut those hands up, now!‚Äù she commanded.

Harper raised his hands. ‚ÄúPlease, don‚Äôt do this. I‚Äôll do whatever you want, just don‚Äôt hurt my family.‚Äù

‚ÄúClearly, you‚Äôre hard of hearing. I‚Äôve made our purpose here obvious.‚Äù She shot a glance at the assailant next to Harper and gave a nod. ‚ÄúFinish it. And don‚Äôt forget to drag that one out,‚Äù she added, gesturing dismissively at the unconscious one on the ground.

‚ÄúPor supuesto,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNothing personal, Mr. Harper. Buenas noches.‚Äù He drew back and delivered a powerful strike with the butt of his gun to the side of Harper‚Äôs head, sending him crumpling to the floor and into a deep, painful unconsciousness.

Gunshots erupted in the room with a deafening roar, blending with the fury of the storm outside, which thundered and rained relentlessly over the community. From the outside, 113 Warren Court seemed peaceful‚Äîan unintended illusion that concealed the horror within.

Gunpowder smoke sat heavy in the Harper home, stripping it of its former warmth. Nothing moved except the simmering stew on the stove.

1k9ldem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1k9ldem/im_in_awe_of_the_power_of_lent/,I'm in awe of the power of Lent,"I've given up things for Lent before, but this past Lent was the first time I gave up several things in an effort to really take the practice of self denial seriously. For me this meant giving up alcohol, meat, fancy coffee, snacking, and sugary drinks. I kept life simple, focusing on daily prayer and giving to the poor (working in a city with many impoverished people helped with this one).

After Lent was over and I started to bring those things back into my life, I noticed how quickly the insatiable desire for them came back too. Even just this past week, when I've had a few drinks, or too much to eat, afterwards I've just felt like, ""Why did I do that?"" I can feel the craving for more almost immediately. It's wild to deny yourself for a period of time and then once you get a little bit, the lust for it comes back again so strongly.

I've read many times in Scripture how Jesus is freedom, and I've grasped it intellectually but this is the first time I really understood it viscerally with my body. I remember reading an interview with a monk who said that abstaining from food is the easiest way to train for controlling yourself against harder things you struggle with. I don't know if anyone else has had this experience with Lenten abstinence, but I guess I just want to say, take Lent seriously as an opportunity to simplify and center yourself on living a life pleasing to God. I think even small practices of denying yourself like on Fridays helps with building up your ability to control sinful and un-Christian-like behaviors that get in the way of your relationship with Christ, and I think you can really get to that place much more easily than you would without a regular practice of abstinence. Maybe I'm preaching to the choir, but I hope this helps someone in their journey towards Christ.",5,1745808452.0,Catholicism,1,1.0,False

i just. love masc women. masculine lesbians. i was never able to explain it and i will struggle to explain it now but i'll try my best: dating a masc lesbian is receiving a warm hug. constantly. i love how they they just *exist* in the world, all loose limbed and self assured, speaking with their hands. *those hands.* sitting with legs spread like she owns the place? like she's waiting for me to climb on her and when she knows it's *exactly* what I'm thinking? leather jacket, denim, jacket, sleeves rolled up and veins showing.

the soft smile that only you get to see? when you get to hold her in your arms shorter than her torso? and i get to tell her, *remind her*, that i am so damn lucky. and reassure her every damn day that how she exists in the world is absolutely perfect. 

the protectiveness? how she looks out for not just me but other women, how other women *see* her and know exactly who she is. that validity in her existing as herself, is a signal for others, but also for lesbians like me? she's stood in coffee shop in a tank top and low waisted jeans, sunglasses on her forehead and she is so *lesbian*. and other people see it too. other lesbians see it, see *us* and maybe another lesbian can think *hey it's possible for me as well.*

she wears a sports bra and boxers under her scrubs and i know that's when she feels her most confident, most herself. and when i have the privilege of dressing up around her and holding onto her arm. when she *guides* me through the crowd and i have never felt more *femme* in my life than in that moment.

she glares at the instruction manual for the new bedside table we bought and says *don't worry i got it*. her biceps flex and she's sat on the floor and i want to sit on *her*. she is so intelligent. she wants to figure out how things work. masc lesbians *take care* and in turn i want to take care of them, *take care of her.* she somehow knows what i need, always what i need, and it makes *me* need *her* so much more.

masculine lesbians. who are unapologetically lesbian. unapologetically masculine. in a world that doesn't want you to be either and especially, definitely, not both: i love you. we see you and we love you. and there is absolutely going to be a woman out there who appreciates every atom of your entire being.

1k9l6uq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9l6uq,First tour: New Haven to Provincetown,"Route: We used the East Coast Greenway (ECG) and Ride with GPS heatmaps to plan the route. We followed ECG for the most part with some detours to avoid unpaved trails. It was a nice mix of mixed-use trails and quieter roads, with the occasional higher traffic road (the ECG map indicates ‚Äúhigh-stress‚Äù sections). Crossing the Sagamore Bridge was the worst part. We split the route into 6 days of riding and 2 rest days in Providence. Full ride data here: https://ridewithgps.com/trips/272755596?privacy_code=Mcoad7j6P25hwZoa89ulti8YSumREx5f 

Bikes and gear: My partner and I both bought our C lines for commuting in NYC, but we were inspired by other Brompton tourers to try a longer trip. I switched out the stock 50T chainring for 44T for easier climbing, though we still found anything above a 10% grade pretty hard. Thankfully we didn‚Äôt get any flats or other mechanical issues. We went credit card-style and stayed at motels + BNB‚Äôs, so we just carried the essentials with some room for groceries. For the bus plus train trip back to NYC, we packed the bikes in Dimpa bags with some cardboard and bubble wrap that we bought at our destination.

Some highlights:
- Quiet country roads in Connecticut leading to and from Willimantic, and the forested roads crossing into Coventry, RI
- Waterfront views throughout Cape Cod, and beach views from Wellfleet
- Favorite coffee stops: Story and Soil (Hartford), Nitro Bar (Providence), Snowy Owl (Sandwich)
- Sweet bread french toast at Al Mac‚Äôs Diner in Fall River

Where we are at so far:

*Cold brews and cold shoulders*

Since the fateful day when I  refused to fund another artisanal caramel smuzzle-fruzzle drink, things between me and Iced Caramel Macchiato have... shifted.
No more 1-on-1 coffee strolls bright an early. Only group coffee runs now, where she miraculously orders a normal drink like everyone else. Small victories make the days go by.

That said, I do detect a slight coolness in her attitude. Maybe it‚Äôs just my paranoia. Maybe it‚Äôs the caffeine withdrawals hitting her harder now. Who‚Äôs to say?

Interestingly enough, he heard whispers a while back from another colleague claiming he got scammed into buying an overpriced drink recently... No names mentioned, but cmonnnnn....

*Announcement day*

Big company news dropped earlier than expected:
They officially announced that my manager is leaving in June ‚Äî and yours truly is stepping into the big boy chair.

Most of the team has actually been really lovely ‚Äî people coming up all morning, offering congratulations, a few even joking that finally someone who will be in the office more than 10 mins a month.

As for Iced Caramel Macchiato?
Not a peep.
Not a word.
Not even a slurp of the straw.

Yes, a few awkward glances across the room, though ‚Äî like she‚Äôs trying to gauge if she should say something, or if she'll get invoiced $18 per compliment (I may be considering it)

*Team morale initiatives*

Now, naturally, as a soon-to-be leader of the people, I‚Äôm thinking of creative ways to foster positive workplace culture. I have been watching Dwight Schrute Manager compilation clips non stop,  all morning.

One idea:
A ""Team Coffee Etiquette"" poster ‚Äî gentle reminders about buying reasonable coffees when it's someone else's shout. You know, promoting healthy habits, financial wellness, mental well-being, and basic human decency. I won't mention any names.

Is that cheeky? Is it petty? Im opening the floor for this one.
But what‚Äôs leadership without a little bit of reform?

Stay tuned..... I might just become the first manager to implement a Fair Trade Coffee-Shout Agreement.

The road ahead is exciting people....

Edit: I just wanted to clarify, I will **NOT** be actually doing this. It's just a cathartic creative exercise. Im trying to add a little bit of humour in my day.",85,1745807240.0,auscorp,32,0.86,False

Mystery Packs are launching this week!
Moving to different packaging, testing new rebranding/packaging.
(See the previous post for details.)

Subscription orders will start shipping this weekend and into the first of the month. Fresh coffee is landing throughout the week! I‚Äôm pushing hard to get everything out ASAP. Basically have 2/4 coffee on hand. Just waiting for things to arrive before we can shop. Tentative target date is first week of May.

We‚Äôre also adding a ton of new coffee,
going harder than anyone‚Äôs ever gone before.

My new timeline is order coffee at the beginning of the month from international roasters. Takes about 2 weeks to arrive, pack 1 week, and have ready to ship by EOM.
 
The vision: 20+ roasters per drop, with 7‚Äì15 of their absolute best coffees each.

Still fine tuning some storage protocols, but we‚Äôre moving toward vacuum sealed, cold storage in the near future. Just need to upgrade the hardware to make it happen.

Big moves incoming with Zero Fucks given.

For some background info, I‚Äôm 24F, my husband is 27M and we have two kids, 1F and 3M. Please no foul comments, yes I am aware I had children young etc and it was not a good decision. I am actively looking for ways to better their lives and they are well taken care of. 

I met my partner 7 years ago, and we were on and off until I got pregnant with my son. 

My partner has various issues. He‚Äôs a heavy drinker, yellowing eyes, exhaustion, weight loss etc. He never leaves the house, never gets home from work at the restaurant until after 1 am, in any argument has smashed my glass coffee table shattering it, tore up my favorite sweatpants while I was still wearing them looking for my phone, punched a hole in the wall, all of the screens off the windows and constantly threatens to end his life if I ever leave him. This happens when he is intoxicated and I express I don‚Äôt like his behavior. Thankfully the kids haven‚Äôt been present for this. 

To his friends and coworkers, he‚Äôs the coolest guy. He treats his girl-friends wonderfully and I honestly have no idea why he acts like this around just me. I try to be the best partner I can for him, I cook clean etc go to work full time and take care of children. Recently I have been getting more and more distant from him, his behaviors to me are become less and less tolerable and I am starting to feel the gravity of the situation. He never has shared me online, hates to go out with me to social gatherings with friends (he will lie where he is before telling me anything) etc. I can admit I am not the best at reacting and sometimes he makes me feel like it‚Äôs my fault since he is nice to everyone else but me. It really hurts. 
Is this unacceptable? Is this abusive? I come from a horrible family environment myself so I‚Äôm not quite sure if it‚Äôs my fault or not. 
I work full time but would not make enough to keep my current living situation and I can‚Äôt even fathom what he would do or lengths he would go to to make my life hell if I leave. I feel stuck. He has threatened killing himself or any future boyfriends I may have if I ever leave with a machete.

I male \[24\] are in a situationship that's fucking with my mental health so bad because of other deeply rooted issues I have not worked through yet.

I was in a 4-year relationship with my ex, but things started to take a turn around October of last year. I was falling out of love with her because I was unsatisfied with the 20% I was fixated on. In hindsight I could have done a better job at communicating and doing more myself, but she did things that made me start looking at the 20%. 1. She was very insecure, 2. She did not take job opportunities that I gave her, 3. Sexually the intimacy became less and less on both our parts. Little things started to add up on both sides that caused a rift. I eventually made the decision to break up with her in February because it came to its finale. It wasn't a good breakup, but we have since made up and talked it out and forgave each other. She is still my best friend, and we still talk but don't have any intention to get back together anytime soon. We were highly compatible, just not ready yet. She was my first love and I'm glad she was. I was her third boyfriend.

Around October we got a new batch of workers at the place I work, and I was training some of them. One of them was another woman who is the same age as me. We can call her Amber \[24\]. Amber is super attractive totally my type physically. I was still with my ex at the time but was always faithful to her. I had approached Amber and introduced myself to her and offered to train her/help her out with any questions work related. (Something I never do is introduce myself to women let alone go out of my way to do so). She was very sweet and friendly at the time and had me write my number down in her notebook since she didn't have a phone at the time. As the months would go on, I saw her around more often especially down where I work, and we would briefly chat about work and simple things like her hair or how the weekend was for us. Nothing ever lasted more than 5-10 minutes. Sometimes a simple hi and bye. However, I noticed in one particular conversation she had stopped me by the elevators and asked me to help her check her hours on the system. While talking to her, she is smiling intently at me, batting her eyes, playing with her hair, and even being somewhat playful in the conversation. She knew I was taken because somehow it made its way in the conversation and previous ones. But I started to feel that this girl Amber had a crush on me. And I was right or at least I thought so.

Fast forward to February, I run into a mutual friend/coworker of Amber's and I in the hallway. We can call her Joan \[35\]. Joan stopped me in the hallway and out of nowhere asked how things were going with my ex. I responded that it ok, but that we are going through some stuff. She then said, ""Oh okay, I can't tell you anything then."" I just laughed and said, ""What I got a secret admirer?"" She nodded yes and said so. Thats when the fucking gears in my head started to turn because earlier that day Joan and Amber came down to where I worked hours earlier and Joan said, ""Hey, don't you think my friend Amber looks cute?"" I said, ""Yeah, I like her hair too, but I think I think Josh looks cuter (Josh is a random male coworker that was working with me at the time). They just laughed, and I quickly walked away not thinking much of it. But, after Joan had told me that upstairs, I immediately got flustered and left. I called another mutual friend of mine and Amber's up to get his opinion. We can call him Henry \[41\]. Henry has given her rides home because he and her live in the same direction. He told me that one night Amber started talking about me and said that ""Your boy \[my name\] can get it"". This was apparently back in October which is when we first started being introduced through small run ins at our job. I was like holy fuck this is tight. But then, I started thinking about my ex and was like nah I can't do that no matter how much we are struggling right now. 15 minutes after Henry and I had that conversation Amber texts me out of nowhere, I did not have her number, but she had mine since October. She came hot and heavy out the gates calling me cute and that she's been looking for me all day and that she wants my help with ""something"". She sent me a photo of herself in the elevator nothing lewd but asks for one back of me. (So, I send one). She starts again with the compliments, and I call her cute as well. Shortly after meeting up with her, we get to talking and she's sharing stuff about her to me. She tells me she has a kid, that she rents an apartment alone with her mom and sister and tells me some personal details about the sister she lost a few years back. So naturally I share stuff about myself back. But as the hour approaches, she tells me that she knows I have a girlfriend, and she is going to respectfully take a step back and that she just wanted to tell me how she felt. I was thankful that she did that, and I told her that I am flattered but that I want to keep my peace and not complicate things.

  
Needless to say, I sat with this for a couple days. I decided to break things off with my ex and I won't lie. A big reason was because of Amber. I wanted to pursue someone new and try new pussy. Yeah, I was unhappy and so was my ex. It would have gotten worst and reached a new boiling point at some time in the near future. So, I said fuck it. Little did I know how much I was going to be hurting despite me doing the breaking up. My ex ended moving back home and I approached Amber a week later and told her what transpired. I was honest with her. I told her, ""I like you, I am attracted to you, and I want to pursue you. But I also want to be truthful with you. I just got out of a 4-year relationship and I'm hurting. I don't want us to move fast, and I don't want to use you as a rebound. I want to build up a friendship with you first. We both work here and the last thing I want is for us not to work out and make things uncomfortable and disrupt each other's peace. We both have a lot going on and you have a child to take care of. With that being said, I would like for us to make time for each other and spend time together outside of work when we can. I want to get to know you and build up something up with you. I don't play with people's emotions because people can get hurt badly that way."" She agreed and told me that I need to heal first and that she'll be there for me. She continued to love-bomb me and follow me at work to the point where other coworkers started noticing it and even a manager called it out by calling us ""love birds"".  Naturally, she was making me feel good while I was hurting, I didn't really fully process the breakup yet. She would call me almost every morning, leave me hearts in the messages and text me consistently for weeks. But out of nowhere she pulled back suddenly. Calls became less frequent to now none, text messages became hours apart sometimes never responding back. This made me spiral in my head thinking ""Was this a game to her?"" I thought we were on the same page. She told me she hasn't dated in 3 years. That she has only had 3 relationships (all of which ended with her being cheated on). She told me she valued consistency and honesty. That communication was not her strong suit and that she hates texting and would rather call. I would ask her out for coffee, or dinner, or even a hike since she told me she likes the outdoors. Not once have we hung out since February. I took it as her being busy since she's a mom and the only breadwinner in her household. But I would sometimes see her stories on IG, and she would be out with friends or chilling at home. Not just that, but as texts became less frequent and response times super long, we would take lunch together and she would be glued to her phone while I'm trying to talk with her. Calling people, texting people back and looking at memes. Mutual friends/co-workers would tell that she really likes me and cares for me. That she would be smiling texting me in the girls locker-room.

I started to take a step back when I saw that. And it hurt because here I am finding myself in a situation that isn't what I thought it was. I got my hopes up about her because she was very sweet in the beginning. She love bombed me, made plans that never came to be, had all these strong qualities I liked, told me she wanted to move slow, and of course our mutual friends told me that she likes and cares for me. I mean ffs she shared what her goals and future plans are and that she wanted to go in the same field as me so I even took her to my college so she could apply. Nonetheless, I started to question everything and her intentions even my own self-worth because I put her on a pedestal. 

Last month on March (28th) I messaged her friend Joan asking if she can give me advice about where Amber's headspace was at since they are close. I Told Joan that I liked Amber etc. etc. she's amazing, but I don't want to hurt myself emotionally if she's not ready. Joan promised to get back to me which she never did till I reached out two weeks later. I want to say on April 1st. Before reaching out to her, I gave Amber the benefit of the doubt because I drove her home one night (second to last week of march), and she argued with her family about her child being up and it got pretty heated since her mom and sister don't work, and they don't want to watch her kid while she's out all day working for the most part. Then baby daddy does petty shit to bother her like take her car seats without asking when he has custody on certain weeks. So, I just let her vent to me and comforted her. I let her know that she can talk to me and I'm ready for her when she is. I felt that we were in a good place right there because I saw a side of her that I haven't seen and that she has real shit going on. I slowed my brain down and it gave me clarity. Mind you I have tried asking her about this stuff, but she doesn't like to share with me, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt because of her hard upbringing struggling with homelessness, neglect from her parents, and bad relationships. Also, I heard a rumor from the guy Joan was fucking at the time that apparently Amber was crying about me. Saying that she likes me but doesn't know what she wants and that she's emotionally not ready. (Joan had told this guy she was fucking and that guy told me) However, things took a turn. I noticed at one point Ambers IG story and highlights stopped appearing on my page which is strange because they were always there, and she was active on social media. I had a feeling she restricted me, and I was right. During lunch one night, she opened her phone next to me and clicked on her story and shit began playing, she quickly closed it, and I think she noticed that I noticed. I took her home that night like nothing happened, and I just stepped back even more. At this point that rubbed me the wrong way and made me question everything again. I stopped taking her home after that.

Shortly after that night, she called out of work for about a week. I messaged her letting her know that I hope she's okay and that I'm here if she needs someone to lean on or go out for a coffee. I never heard from her. This is when Joan got back to me on April 1st. Joan told me that Amber was vague on the response and that she was dealing with a lot and that she was not emotionally ready for anything. She apologized to me for setting us up at the time and that she was sorry for any pain caused. I had my clarity and kept it pushing. I told Joan that I wasn't upset and that I hope Amber gets through what she's going through and that I will see them around at work. The next day on April 2nd Amber texts me late at 10PM just an hour before our shift is over and she is fucking fuming. Saying she's hearing shit from other people about how I feel about her among other bullshit. That I didn't tell her I was working the same day as her. (Idk why she put that, we have never shared every time one of us was working. Sometimes I didn't know she was working the same shift as me and I would not know until the night was done at clock out) She continued to text me that she goes through a lot mentally and no one knows how she feels. She came at me sideways like if I was her dude. I was like ""Woah, what the fuck?"" I offered to talk in person since she apparently hates texting, and I wanted to clear the air and get things off my chest and understand why she felt the way she did. Hopefully even set boundaries and see what this was. She didn't want to talk that night, so I offered to take her out for coffee next week on Monday which she agreed too. I checked in with her Sunday morning and she never responded to me until 8PM asking what time. She told me she was at the aquarium with her kid. Needless to say, the coffee didn't happen, and she stood me up. At this point I've done tooooo much. But it didn't sit well with me and I gave her the benefit of the doubt again. I called her Monday around the time we were supposed to go, and she told me that she still wants to meet up but that she has her kid and is calling her mom to watch her child. I asked her to keep me updated and that I would still be willing to pick her up and meet. She never got back to me or even apologized. She was out of work for a whole week with the flu, doctors note and everything. I ended up unfollowing her on Instagram because of the whole restriction thing and how she stood me up. There has been zero communication on her part. Funny enough before I unfollowed her, she was commenting under reels the same day she sent me that angry message to me. For context the post said, ""When he stops texting you good morning and calling you, so you know your free trial is over"".  She commented under that post saying, ""He doesn't care about me anymore"" and then a day after saying ""He still cares about me guys stop liking the comment"" (at this point I don't think I'm the only guy she was talking to)

The kicker is she wanted to talk about this in person when I offered and agreed to meet for coffee yet stands me up with no explanation. It gets better, she hits me up a week after she recovers and tells me her work schedule. Once again, no apology or explanation. I end up seeing her Friday before I leave home, and she tells me to have a goodnight and sorry we didn't get to talk in person today. (She was texting me Friday If I was going to be working).

At this point I don't believe I'm going to get the clarity I need from the talk she agreed to have after she sent me that message. I'm wondering if she's just really damaged or manipulative or both.

As far as I know from what I have seen/felt:

1. She lovedbombed me at the start \[I'm not familiar with dating out there or know what it's like. I've been in one solid relationship\]

2. It felt like she began breadcrumbing me with the super late texts and hitting me up randomly when I would not text her back and would say things like ""We should go hiking,"" I'm like cool let me know when you're available.

3. She is very bad at communication and seems to avoid ""confrontations"" despite agreeing to have them

4. Her actions aren't lying up with her words

5. Mixed signals

6. Has not made an effort to hang out or get to know me

7. Restricted off IG for whatever reason

8. Is telling other people she cares and likes me but hasn't told me herself??? (unless its all lies)

9. If two people like each other, it's never this difficult and communication is the bare minimum, time will be made in anyway so that two people can see each other and spend time with one another

9b. One night I was taking her home and she said, ""I don't like you having to give me a ride because I live so far away,"" I responded back, ""I like taking you home because I get to spend more time with you and hearing you sing"" (we would do karaoke in the car). Her response? Not a damn thing. Either she felt flustered by it or maybe didn't really care. It's whatever at this point

Is this what its like meeting people and trying to bond with them in 2025??? Am I the crazy one? 

I'm looking for advice and peoples input anything helps. I am stressed out my fucking mind especially with the unfinished ""talk"" about why she sent me that. It is causing me a bunch of emotional distress to the point where it has fucked with my peace. I have no problems in life, no real responsibility. I work, go to school, hit the gym, and take myself out from time to time. I was fine sharing my peace with someone so long as they reciprocated the same amount of energy and feelings back regardless of what they have going on. Why is it so hard for people to be honest and communicate especially if that's what you say you wanted? I never asked for anything, and I was upfront about my intentions. So there you have it.

At home, if I'm preparing a meal it will most likely be something not associated with American food. Pho, ramen, Thai curries. Cottage pie, popovers (Grammy's variant of Yorkshire pudding essentially), roasted pork tenderloin, steak frites, lasagna. Pizza. A ham and cheese sandwich. Tacos ffs. I can think of a handful of regionally specific items maybe, such as chicken & dumplings, stuffed peppers, beef liver & onions (that one's just for me when the wife and kid are out, they would never). If I feel frisky, a 3 bone prime rib roast for a special occasion a couple times per year. Bacon, eggs, and toast for breakfast if I actually had the time for breakfast (it's just coffee, black thank you). But just about every cuisine is borrowed.

BBQ maybe? But even that is influenced by other cuisines. And I'm not referring to burgers and hot dogs, nobody here calls that BBQ, I mean long smokes: brisket, pulled pork shoulder, ribs, chicken wings at the minimum.

I male \[24\] are in a situationship that's fucking with my mental health so bad because of other deeply rooted issues I have not worked through yet.

I was in a 4-year relationship with my ex, but things started to take a turn around October of last year. I was falling out of love with her because I was unsatisfied with the 20% I was fixated on. In hindsight I could have done a better job at communicating and doing more myself, but she did things that made me start looking at the 20%. 1. She was very insecure, 2. She did not take job opportunities that I gave her, 3. Sexually the intimacy became less and less on both our parts. Little things started to add up on both sides that caused a rift. I eventually made the decision to break up with her in February because it came to its finale. It wasn't a good breakup, but we have since made up and talked it out and forgave each other. She is still my best friend, and we still talk but don't have any intention to get back together anytime soon. We were highly compatible, just not ready yet. She was my first love and I'm glad she was. I was her third boyfriend.

Around October we got a new batch of workers at the place I work, and I was training some of them. One of them was another woman who is the same age as me. We can call her Amber \[24\]. Amber is super attractive totally my type physically. I was still with my ex at the time but was always faithful to her. I had approached Amber and introduced myself to her and offered to train her/help her out with any questions work related. (Something I never do is introduce myself to women let alone go out of my way to do so). She was very sweet and friendly at the time and had me write my number down in her notebook since she didn't have a phone at the time. As the months would go on, I saw her around more often especially down where I work, and we would briefly chat about work and simple things like her hair or how the weekend was for us. Nothing ever lasted more than 5-10 minutes. Sometimes a simple hi and bye. However, I noticed in one particular conversation she had stopped me by the elevators and asked me to help her check her hours on the system.

One night I was taking her home and she said, ""I don't like you having to give me a ride because I live so far away,"" I responded back, ""I like taking you home because I get to spend more time with you and hearing you sing"" (we would do karaoke in the car). Her response? Not a damn thing. Either she felt flustered by it or maybe didn't really care. It's whatever at this point

Is this what it's like meeting people and trying to bond with them in 2025??? Am I the crazy one? 

I'm looking for advice and peoples input anything helps. I am stressed out my fucking mind especially with the unfinished ""talk"" about why she sent me that. It is causing me a bunch of emotional distress to the point where it has fucked with my peace. I have no problems in life, no real responsibility. I work, go to school, hit the gym, and take myself out from time to time. I was fine sharing my peace with someone so long as they reciprocated the same amount of energy and feelings back regardless of what they have going on. Why is it so hard for people to be honest and communicate especially if that's what you say you wanted? I never asked for anything, and I was upfront about my intentions. So, there you have it.

I had been in a rough relationship for 2 years with a guy from 18-21, friends with him since 16. I waited a year before dating again. 

This guy, let‚Äôs call him Andrew, seemed amazing. Funny, compassionate, driven, honest. He wasn‚Äôt my exact type physically, but he had such charisma. I had a date that weekend with another guy from hinge that had been previously set up to Andrew (this is important later), and it was bleh, so I stuck with dating Andrew.

He wanted to become official after the third date, to which I politely asked if we could wait. We did. We became official in July. I didn‚Äôt know much about his family, we lived about 45 min away from one another, not too far. 

He was complimentary, kind, respectful. He took us to antique malls, coffee shops, we did arts and crafts, etc. I‚Äôd attend sports things he liked, so on. 

Important note number 2: I am chronically ill. I have POTS, PANS, (I joke I‚Äôm a kitchen), EDS, Fibromyalgia and migraines. I told him these minus EDS once I got that diagnosis last year. He was completely okay with this, as he had mental health issues (depression, social anxiety). I understood, having my own such as anxiety, ocd, adhd. 

Covid hits, we continue to date. I see his family less and vice versa dude to it. He proposes October. We get married April.

Things change.

He states he doesn‚Äôt like the church he goes to anymore (dealbreaker for me at the time. He said his friends left the church, so he quit going.) 

Still, to this day, will tell acquaintances I ‚Äúcheated‚Äù on him because I went on a date with that other guy after our FIRST DATE.

He makes little jabs. They‚Äôre jokes!! Just jokes. Like, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you go and make me a sandwich?‚Äù Or, ‚Äúoh good job, you finally didn‚Äôt laundry!‚Äù And I believed that. Until last summer, when it got really bad. I thought it was just me. I thought I was the problem. But he began to make me feel like any request, any help, was such a chore. I mean, ‚Äúhey can you clean your bowl from dinner please?‚Äù When I‚Äôm absolutely exhausted from cooking dinner and need to lie down. He sets it beside the sink. Here is a list I‚Äôve compiled:

He would NOT let me tell my parents if we argued. Said it was just between us. The few times I told my mom out of OCD guilt, he got furious. 

‚ÄúIf I treated you the way you wanted me to, I‚Äôd be doing a full caretaker job.‚Äù



‚ÄúIf (my niece, who is goth) wore a dress, it wouldn‚Äôt look right because of her style. If I wore what she did-‚Äú
‚ÄúWhich no one ever should.‚Äù (Shaming her style.)

‚ÄúYou threw trash on my face‚Äù
‚ÄúWe were in a playful mood.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo we weren‚Äôt.‚Äù (I was lying down. He threw plastic from my supplement bottle on my face because it was on his side of the bed.)

‚ÄúCan you try to not look like you want to kill yourself?‚Äù During his presentation, said in front of his sister. I was just watching.

‚ÄúLook, there‚Äôs two whales by the pool.‚Äù Talking about overweight women. I called him out, and he cried. 

My psychiatrist said he was a narcissist, so I set a boundary. I left for my parents a week ago. We WhatsApp called, and he said two weeks for no talking, I agreed. Then when he kept texting me, I said I was trying to respect that and he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I gave you that impression.‚Äù 
Felt like boundaries weren‚Äôt respected, and he twisted his own words.

He tapped my face during play fights. I say he did. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done that before.‚Äù I knew he hadn‚Äôt, he swore he had. I said to never do that again. 

Asked for time to sort through my feelings and thoughts, he kept coming into the room to ask if it was ‚Äúabout us though.‚Äù And ‚Äúbut are we okay?‚Äù When I came home after being out with Felicity, he was withdrawn and doing the same thing, saying he just needed time. 

Not believing in uv radiation as a joke for almost 2 years until I nearly broke up with him and then he said it was all a ‚Äúbit‚Äù.

Parents offered to pay to have someone professionally clean apartment, he got very defensive. Why? If we are both too busy or out of energy, why? 

He absolutely cries if I give him any criticism. He‚Äôll say he‚Äôs fat. Or his hair looks ugly. I say it doesn‚Äôt. He sulks. He has no self esteem. Refuses to go on medicine for his depression. Says his counselor (where I have seen no change) helps enough. 

Twisting my words. Guilt tripping. Crying for attention. Saying he cries because of me. Blame shifting! 

Am I freaking crazy? Is this covert narcissism? I‚Äôm setting up couples counseling as a last resort before divorce to see if there‚Äôs a shred of any of the 6 years I can salvage since we are both religious. Praise that there‚Äôs NO KIDS. Because he, Cherry on top, has a porn addiction. Which he swore he quit. He‚Äôs never finished in me. Said he couldn‚Äôt wear a condom. He can‚Äôt keep it up wearing one. I don‚Äôt want a baby, and would rather not get a BV with spermicide, or heavy periods with a copper IUD. I went on the mini pill year one of our marriage and was a walking bitch on wheels that got two periods a month. Hormones are out. Please, advice. Thank you.

As we stepped into the hotel lobby, Karri instantly shrank back ‚Äî hiding half behind me, her hands clutching my arm tightly.  
Her brave walk through the hallways had drained her boldness ‚Äî and now, under the bright lights of the lobby, surrounded by families and couples, the reality of her outfit hit her hard.

The thin red mesh dress was barely covering her.  
No bra. No panties.  
Every curve, every mark from our wild nights, every secret... whispered through the sheer fabric.

She kept her head low, hair falling over her face, blushing deep.

And then ‚Äî it happened.

An Indian couple, maybe mid-30s, noticed us.  
The woman, wearing a simple kurti and jeans, smiled warmly and walked over.

""Meeru Hyderabad nunchi vachhara? Telugu vinipinchindi!""  
(""Are you from Hyderabad? I heard you speaking Telugu!"")

Karri froze ‚Äî like a deer in headlights.  
I smiled awkwardly and nodded.

The woman kept chatting, friendly and curious, while Karri ‚Äî mortified ‚Äî stood there trembling slightly, clutching my hand so tightly I could feel her nails digging in.

Every few seconds, Karri would nervously tug at the hem of her almost-nonexistent dress, trying hopelessly to pull it lower.  
The Indian lady's eyes flickered ‚Äî clearly shocked at Karri‚Äôs outfit ‚Äî but too polite to say anything.

That‚Äôs when John approached ‚Äî calm, confident, grinning like the devil himself.

Without hesitation, he slid his strong arm casually around Karri's bare, trembling shoulders and said:

""Hey there ‚Äî I‚Äôm John. Their friend. We‚Äôve been having one hell of a vacation!""

Karri nearly died on the spot.  
Her face turned deep crimson.  
Her body stiffened under his touch.  
She looked like she wanted the floor to open and swallow her whole.

The thin dress clung to her shy body,  
her dark nipples clearly outlined through the wet, see-through mesh,  
the golden thali swinging gently between her bare breasts,  
and lower ‚Äî the curves of her hips and thighs completely visible through the golden crisscross strings.

The Indian woman blinked ‚Äî stunned ‚Äî eyes darting between Karri‚Äôs almost-nude body, my awkward smile, and John's cocky grin.

Karri pressed herself tightly against me, clutching my arm with both hands now, desperate for cover ‚Äî her soft, warm body trembling against mine.

The Indian husband, noticing the situation, mumbled something quickly to his wife, and they politely excused themselves, walking away with hurried, embarrassed steps.

John chuckled softly.  
Karri buried her face against my chest, whispering:

""Nee vallaki naa roopam chaala clear ga gurthu untundi ippudu...""  
(""They‚Äôll never forget seeing me like this..."")

I gently kissed the top of her head, wrapping my arms around her protectively ‚Äî feeling both her shame and her strange, thrilling excitement.

We quickly finished checkout, Karri practically glued to my side, hiding her glowing, almost-naked body behind me every step of the way.

But even as she blushed and trembled...  
A tiny, secret smile played at the edges of her lips.

Somewhere deep inside her shy, tender heart ‚Äî  
a new, wild Karri was waking up.

  


üå∏ **Parking Lot Secrets ‚Äî New Friends, New Dangers** üå∏

We were about to get into the car when we heard a cheerful call:

""Anna! Okkasari group photo teesukundama?""  
(""Brother! Shall we take one group photo?"")

It was Prasad and Sureka, waving from near their car.

Sureka giggled, her bright smile lighting up the morning.  
Laxmi hesitated, hiding half behind me, her bare thighs trembling under the flimsy red mesh.

John grinned and happily grabbed the DSLR camera Sureka offered.  
Without fully understanding the Telugu, he sensed what was happening ‚Äî and looked more than eager to capture Laxmi's helpless, exposed beauty again.

We lined up ‚Äî me, Laxmi, Prasad, and Sureka.

As we posed, Prasad casually placed his hand on Laxmi‚Äôs delicate shoulder.  
Her entire body tensed under the bold, almost possessive touch.

The mesh fabric clung tighter to her curves,  
the thali swinging gently between her small, heaving breasts,  
her dusky nipples perfectly outlined through the thin red.

John snapped photo after photo, smirking.

In between shots, Prasad smiled and asked in Telugu:

""Meeru Hyderabad lo ekkada?""  
(""Where in Hyderabad are you from?"")

I smiled awkwardly, still holding Laxmi tightly.

""Manam Kukatpally nunchi.""  
(""We‚Äôre from Kukatpally."")

Sureka's face lit up:

""Wow! Memu Madhapur nunchi! Chala daggaragane undi!""  
(""Wow! We‚Äôre from Madhapur! So close!"")

Laxmi blinked in shock, trembling more.  
Sureka clapped her hands happily:

""Chaala bagundhi! Mana mana vallu dorikina feeling untundi kada!""  
(""It feels so nice finding our people here, right!"")

John, holding the camera, watched this rapid Telugu chatter with amusement, clearly enjoying Laxmi‚Äôs blushing even without understanding.

Sureka leaned closer and whispered to Laxmi mischievously:

""Dress chala bold ra akka... aah confidence vere level.""  
(""Your dress is so bold, akka... your confidence is another level!"")

Laxmi buried her burning face into my arm, half-hiding her smile.

  


**A Casual Question Turns Everything**

Just as we were about to finish, Prasad casually asked:  
**""America lo ekkada untaru meeru?""** (""Where do you live in America?"")

Still clinging to my arm, Laxmi stammered:  
**""Tennessee... Nashville lo.""** (""In Tennessee... Nashville area."")

Sureka's face lit up:  
**""Wow! Mem kuda Nashville lo untamu! 15 minutes distance untundi!""** (""Wow! We‚Äôre also in Nashville! It's just 15 minutes away!"")

Laxmi‚Äôs heart skipped a beat ‚Äî her cheeks burning hotter than ever.

Sureka giggled:  
**""Mana Indian parties lo tappakunda kalustam!""** (""We‚Äôll definitely meet at Indian parties then!"")

John just stood there, half-smirking, sipping his coffee, clearly enjoying Laxmi‚Äôs shy helplessness without understanding much Telugu.

  


**The Group Picture**

Then came the moment:  
**""Group pic teesukundam!""** (""Let‚Äôs take a group picture!"")

John stepped forward, grabbing the DSLR, while we lined up again near the car.  
Laxmi desperately tried to adjust her scandalously sheer red mesh dress, pulling the hem lower, tugging at the thin straps, but it was hopeless.  
Nothing could hide her body now.

Prasad stood beside Laxmi, slipping his hand over her shoulder for the photo.  
But as the moment stretched...  
his hand **""accidentally""** slipped lower...  
grazing the very top of her exposed breast through the see-through fabric, his fingers almost brushing the black areola.

Laxmi stiffened, panic flashing in her eyes.  
She instinctively shifted her body closer into me ‚Äî her soft side pressing against my ribs ‚Äî but she didn‚Äôt dare cause a scene.

John, behind the camera, chuckled softly as he clicked another photo.  
**""Smile!""** he teased.

Laxmi gave the tiniest, most helpless smile ‚Äî her whole body trembling.  
The camera clicked again ‚Äî a crystal-clear, high-definition capture of:

* Laxmi standing half-naked under the bright sun,
* Prasad's hand almost cupping her breast,
* her thali glittering wildly against her naked chest,
* and her mesh dress doing nothing to hide her shame.

  


**Compliments and More Embarrassment**

After the photos, Sureka giggled:  
**""Chala bagundi! Nuvvu model laga vunnav ra Laxmi!""** (""So beautiful! You look like a model, Laxmi!"")

Laxmi mumbled shyly:  
**""Naa dress konchem... light ekkuva undi kada...""** (""My dress is a bit... too light, isn‚Äôt it..."")

Sureka winked:  
**""Anduke sexy ga vuntundi!""** (""That‚Äôs why it looks sexy!"")

John handed the camera back and laughed:  
**""You all look... unforgettable.""**

We quickly exchanged numbers ‚Äî phones beeping with new contacts.

  


**The Real Shock**

As we set up for the final group selfie ‚Äî me, Laxmi, John, Sureka, and Prasad ‚Äî  
John casually stepped behind Laxmi, pretending to ""help"" fix her dress.

With a mischievous tug,  
he pulled the mesh up slightly ‚Äî not down ‚Äî  
lifting it enough to expose the underside of her breasts,  
the black, puffy areola clearly visible under the red.

Sureka's eyes widened ‚Äî stunned ‚Äî seeing everything.  
The transparent dress clung tighter, shamelessly revealing:

* Laxmi‚Äôs bare side-boob,
* dark, swollen nipple pressing against the mesh,
* John‚Äôs rough hand suspiciously low on her waist ‚Äî almost on her ass.

Sureka awkwardly cleared her throat, but said nothing.  
Poor Laxmi...  
Her whole body stiffened under John's touch, her nails digging into my palm.  
Still, she couldn't stop it.  
She couldn't protest.  
She couldn't escape.

The camera clicked again. üì∏  
Another crystal-clear, almost pornographic shot.

  


**Tension in the Parking Lot**

After the final pic, Sureka laughed nervously:  
**""Meeru chala bindass ra Laxmi! America lo full freedom kada!""** (""You‚Äôre so bold, Laxmi! Full freedom in America, right!"")

Laxmi just gave a tiny, broken laugh ‚Äî burying her burning face against my shoulder.  
Sureka hugged Laxmi lightly ‚Äî feeling the sheer wet fabric ‚Äî and whispered.

In the parking lot, Laxmi clung to my arm, trembling,  
as John walked just a few steps behind us, grinning wide.

She whispered softly to me in Telugu:  
**""Nenu ippatiki shock lo unnanu... na dress lo vallaki anni kanipistunnayi...""**  
(""I‚Äôm still in shock... they saw everything through my dress..."")

I kissed her forehead and whispered back:  
**""Nee roopam, na adrustam.""** (""Your beauty is my blessing."")

Her thali glittered in the sunlight ‚Äî  
the final proof that no matter how wild, how exposed, how humiliated she felt ‚Äî  
her heart belonged to me, and me alone.

I pulled Laxmi closer, grinning wickedly, and said loud enough for everyone to hear:  
**""Balle unnavvu ra lanje laga... Prasad ki kannaalu venaka pettaledu nee pai... vadidi kinda sagam perigindi chusava?""**  
(""You look damn good, like a real slut... Prasad can‚Äôt even blink looking at you... did you see? He‚Äôs half hard down there already!"")

John burst out laughing even though he didn‚Äôt understand the Telugu ‚Äî he could feel the wild energy.  
Sureka‚Äôs mouth dropped open slightly, blushing fiercely but trying to hide it.  
Prasad awkwardly shifted, trying to hide himself, but it was too late.

And poor Laxmi...  
Her whole body shivered against me ‚Äî humiliated beyond words.  
Her hands instinctively tried to pull down the sheer red dress ‚Äî but it was hopeless.

* Her dusky nipples,
* her soft belly,
* even the hint of her wet slit ‚Äî

everything was outlined for everyone to see.  
Her golden thali swung helplessly between her breasts, glittering like a sinful necklace of shame and love.

Her face buried into my chest, whispering almost inaudibly:  
**""Please... let‚Äôs go...""**

But even as she begged,  
her body pressed tighter against mine ‚Äî  
betraying her secret excitement. üå∏

  


**The Drive Home**

We finally got into the car.  
Laxmi, trembling, quickly buckled her seatbelt ‚Äî still trying to pull her scandalous red mesh dress lower over her thighs, even though it was hopeless.

As I started the engine, my phone buzzed ‚Äî a new message.  
Since I was driving, Laxmi picked it up and checked.  
It was from Prasad:  
**Prasad:**  
*""Nice meeting you guys today! Safe drive! See you around soon!""*

Laxmi let out a small, shaky breath ‚Äî half relief, half leftover nervousness.  
She handed the phone to me, her fingers brushing mine, still ice-cold from the tension.

I smiled a little, squeezing her hand reassuringly.  
**""No drama,""** I said softly.  
**""Just friendly people.""**

  


**The Photos**

But Laxmi‚Äôs mind was still stuck on the photos.  
Her thumb hesitated over the chat ‚Äî and she couldn't resist.  
She tapped open the gallery.

And there they were.  
The parking lot photos.  
Crystal clear.  
Every scandalous, humiliating detail captured forever.

The group shots ‚Äî  
where Prasad‚Äôs hand was way too low, brushing the top of her breast.

The close-ups ‚Äî  
where the sheer red mesh exposed the dark circles of her nipples.

The cursed moment ‚Äî  
where John‚Äôs hand adjusted her dress upwards, flashing half her areola, fully visible to the camera.

Laxmi‚Äôs face turned beet red.  
Her hand flew to her mouth in horror as she zoomed into one of the worst photos.

From her angle, she could see it even clearer:

* The curve of her exposed sideboob,
* The glittering thali chain slicing across her naked chest,
* Prasad‚Äôs eyes glued shamelessly to her body,
* Sureka‚Äôs stunned expression,
* John smirking behind the camera.

She gasped softly, clutching the phone against her chest ‚Äî as if trying to erase what she had just seen.

I glanced sideways at her, smirking a little.  
One hand on the wheel, the other gently resting on her trembling bare thigh.

**""You looked beautiful,""** I said in Telugu, low and teasing.

Laxmi shook her head fiercely, burying her burning face into my arm.

But her body...  
...her body was betraying her.  
Her thighs rubbing slowly together under the flimsy mesh.  
Her chest rising and falling fast.

  


**A New Invitation**

As we drove toward home, Laxmi‚Äôs phone buzzed again.  
She glanced down ‚Äî expecting maybe another polite goodbye from Prasad.

But no ‚Äî  
this time it was a message from Sureka, directly to Laxmi:  
**Sureka:**  
*""Laxmi! Chala bagundhi ee roju... super fun talking with you!* üòò  
*Let's meet at home sometime! Small get-together chestham!""*  
(""Laxmi! Today was so nice... it was super fun talking to you! Let‚Äôs meet at home sometime! We‚Äôll do a small get-together!"")

Laxmi smiled nervously, her fingers hesitating over the keyboard.  
Still blushing, she typed a soft reply:

**Laxmi:**  
*""Sure ra! Chala santosham ga undi meet avvadam!* ‚ù§Ô∏è*""*  
(""Sure! I‚Äôm so happy we met too!"")

Just as she hit send, another notification popped up.  
Sureka had started a new group chat:  
üèñÔ∏è **""Nashville Friends""** üèñÔ∏è  
**Members:**

* Prasad
* Sureka
* Me (you)
* Laxmi
* John

Immediately, a message came:

**Sureka:**  
*""Sharing the best pic from today! Memories!* üòç*""*

And she uploaded a photo.

  


**The Ultimate Humiliation**

Laxmi tapped to open it full screen...  
and she froze.  
Her heart almost stopped.

In the main photo:

* Her red mesh dress was almost completely invisible in the sunlight.
* Her lower half was clearly bare ‚Äî no panties visible at all.
* 95% of her breasts were exposed, the dark circles of her nipples shining clearly through the wet fabric.
* Behind her, in the side mirror of the car, you could see her full bare back ‚Äî smooth, glistening, completely nude, every curve perfectly reflected.

It was obscene.  
Accidental... but obscene.  
Worse ‚Äî it was now shared in a group where Prasad and John could zoom and stare freely.

Laxmi gasped, covering her mouth with her hands, her phone trembling in her grip.

She looked at me, wide-eyed, desperate, whispering:  
**""Photos lo anni kanipistunnayi... Naku teliyadhu...""**  
(""Everything is showing in the photos... I didn‚Äôt even know..."")

I calmly squeezed her bare thigh, smirking slightly:  
**""Late ayipoyindi ra... ippudu andariki telusu...""**  
(""Too late, baby... now everyone knows..."")

On the chat, Prasad reacted with üî•üî• emojis.  
John casually dropped a üòç.

Laxmi's whole body shrank smaller against the car door, her legs squeezing together ‚Äî  
burning alive with helpless shame,  
but unable to stop staring at the scandalous picture of herself.

She could see every filthy detail if she zoomed in ‚Äî

* the hard nipples,
* the bare back,
* even a faint hint of her smooth mound if you looked close enough.

And now...  
it was saved in all their phones.  
**Forever.**

  


As Laxmi stared at the scandalous photo on her phone, still trembling,  
another notification buzzed.

üèñÔ∏è **Nashville Friends Group Changed Profile Picture.**  
**Updated by: Sureka.**

Laxmi blinked in horror ‚Äî  
she quickly tapped the group chat.

And there it was.

**Sureka had set the group profile picture** ‚Äî  
not just any random safe photo ‚Äî  
but **that** exact **scandalous** group photo:

* Her see-through red mesh
* Bare thighs
* 95% exposed nipples
* The shimmering thali chain swinging across her bare chest
* Her completely **nude back** visible in the car mirror.

**That photo**  
was now the **official face** of the group ‚Äî  
**publicly pinned** at the top for anyone who opened the chat to see immediately.

Laxmi gasped, her fingers flying to her mouth again.

""Profile pic... chesaru... aa photo..."" she whispered, tears almost filling her eyes.  
(""They made... *that photo*... the profile picture..."")

I laughed under my breath, unable to hide the wicked grin spreading across my face.

""Chaala beautiful group face undi kada..."" I teased softly.  
(""Isn‚Äôt it a beautiful group face now?"")

From the backseat, John ‚Äî who had been quietly checking his phone ‚Äî chuckled and said:

""Man, that's a HOT profile pic! üî• Lucky group!""

He still didn't know all the Telugu context ‚Äî  
but he knew exactly what he was looking at.

Prasad casually dropped a voice note into the group:

**Prasad:**  
*""thanks to John!‚Äù*

Laxmi was frozen in her seat ‚Äî  
face buried in her palms,  
her body pressed tightly against the door,  
desperate to hide, to disappear, to undo everything ‚Äî  
but there was no escape now.

Every second that passed, the group notification stayed proudly pinned:  
üèñÔ∏è **Nashville Friends** ‚Äî with **Laxmi's nude body** as the cover.

  


  


  


üå∏ **Parking Lot Secrets + Nashville Friends Group Explosion** üå∏

As we drove on, the car buzzing with tension,  
another burst of notifications exploded from the **Nashville Friends** group.

**John**, excited by the new group energy, casually uploaded a few of his own photos before Laxmi could even react:

üì∏ **1st Photo**:

* Laxmi stepping out of the ocean in that sheer black bikini.
* Water pouring off her glistening body.
* The wet, clinging fabric turning almost invisible.
* Her full breasts ‚Äî dark nipples standing hard ‚Äî clearly visible through the fabric.
* Her hips, thighs, even the soft shadow of her mound visible between her legs.

üì∏ **2nd Photo**:

* Inside the wild beach club.
* Laxmi, totally drunk, laughing uncontrollably.
* Her mini-skirt bunched up over her tummy, **clearly exposing** everything.
* Her flimsy black cami top almost torn off, barely hanging from one strap.
* Two of John's friends holding her:
   * One had a full grip on her exposed breast.
   * Another grabbed her bare ass, grinding into her drunken, helpless body.

Both photos were brutally clear ‚Äî full HD, bright lighting ‚Äî **nothing left to imagination**.

Before Laxmi could even scream or protest ‚Äî the images were posted.  
**Instantly saved** by everyone in the group.  
**Permanent**.

Laxmi gasped in horror, grabbing at her phone ‚Äî but it was too late.  
She curled tighter into her seat,  
shaking uncontrollably,  
then suddenly ‚Äî she **burst into tears**.

Silent, broken crying ‚Äî  
her small body trembling against the car door,  
one hand over her mouth to muffle the sounds.

I glanced at her with a wicked smile...  
relishing every second of her helpless shame.

  


**Group Chat Explodes:**

Prasad tried to say something polite:

**Prasad** üôè**:**  
""Super daring moments captured beautifully.""

(And then he stayed silent, only reacting later.)

But **Sureka** went absolutely wild ‚Äî  
flooding it with Telugu comments, laughing emojis, hearts, and praises:

**Sureka** üî•**:**  
""Laxmi akka, nuvvu full bold queen ra!""  
(""Laxmi akka, you're a full bold queen!"")

**Sureka** üòÇ**:**  
""Ahaaa... America lo full freedom ante idi kada!""  
(""Ahaa... this is what full freedom in America means!"")

**Sureka** üòà**:**  
""Next party ki sexy dress compulsory ra!""  
(""Next party, sexy dress is a must!"")

Then she teased even more savagely:

**Sureka** üëë**:**  
""Stretch marks kooda visible ra... chala realistic ga beautiful ga unnayi!""  
(""Even your stretch marks are visible... looking so real and beautiful!"")

**Sureka** ‚ù§Ô∏è**:**  
""C-section scar chusanu beach pic lo... pure mommy queen ra!""  
(""I saw your C-section scar in the beach pic... pure mommy queen!"")

**Sureka** üòç**:**  
""Beach lo chala mandhi staring chesthunaru... nenu akkadunte direct touch cheyyadaniki try chesthey!""  
(""So many people were staring at you at the beach... if I was there, I would've tried to touch you directly!"")

**BOOM.**

Sureka set the **worst beach club photo** ‚Äî  
Laxmi‚Äôs drunk, exposed body ‚Äî  
as the **group profile picture**.

  


**Laxmi‚Äôs Heartbreak Response:**

Still crying silently,  
her fingers trembling,  
Laxmi finally typed back ‚Äî in broken, shaky Telugu:

**Laxmi** üå∏ **(typing slowly, tears dropping):**  
""Sorry Sureka akka... naaku chala bayam vesthundi... nenu chala cheap ga feel chesthunnanu...""  
(""Sorry Sureka akka... I feel so scared... I feel so cheap..."")

For a moment the group went quiet.

Then Sureka messaged something so raw, so unexpected, it stunned even me:

**Sureka** üå∏**:**  
""Nenu kuda wish chesthunnanu... college days lo ila enjoy chesthunte bagundedi... aa freedom, aa madness... nee story chala inspiring ga undi Laxmi!""  
(""I also wish I had done all this... if only I had enjoyed like this during my college days... your story is so inspiring, Laxmi!"")

And quietly,  
**Prasad** reacted with just a ‚ù§Ô∏è on Sureka‚Äôs message.

Nothing more.

Silent approval.  
Silent pride.

  


**Calm After the Storm ‚Äî Personal Chatting Starts:**

The energy shifted after that.

Sureka sent another softer, more emotional message:

**Sureka** üòä**:**  
""Nuvvu oka baaga prema chese ammayi ra Laxmi... chala manchi soul... idi journey matram... body shame ledu, only memories undali.""  
(""You're a girl full of love, Laxmi... you have such a beautiful soul... this is just a journey... no body shame, only memories should stay."")

John added:

**John** üçª**:**  
""You‚Äôre awesome! Can't wait to hang out again. Chill BBQ next weekend?""

Finally, Laxmi calmed down a little.  
She wiped her wet cheeks, closed her eyes for a second,  
and slowly smiled... tiny, but real.

She replied to the group:

**Laxmi** üå∏**:**  
""Mee words vinaka... naaku strength vastundi... thank you everyone... love you all...""  
(""Hearing your words... I'm gaining strength... thank you everyone... love you all..."")

Sureka immediately responded:

**Sureka** ‚ù§Ô∏è**:**  
""We love you more ra bold queen!""

And for the first time that night ‚Äî  
Laxmi laughed softly.

A broken, wet laugh...  
but a **free** one.

The shame was still there.  
The humiliation burned deep.  
But now... it was wrapped in something **sweet**.  
Acceptance.  
Friendship.  
Freedom.

üå∏üå∏üå∏

  


  


After the wild group chat calmed down a little,  
Sureka created a **private side chat** ‚Äî just her and Laxmi.

**Sureka** ‚ù§Ô∏è**:**

""Ra Laxmi... ninnu personal ga matladali anipistundi... cheppali chala emotions...""  
(""Hey Laxmi... I feel like talking to you personally... so many emotions to share..."")

**Laxmi** üå∏ **(still shy):**

""Cheppu akka...""  
(""Tell me, akka..."")

Before Sureka could start,  
**John** ‚Äî ever cheerful ‚Äî jumped into the main group chat:

**John** üçª**:**

""Hey hey! Speak English please! üòÇ I‚Äôm feeling left out!""

Laxmi and Sureka both **burst out laughing** privately.

**Sureka** üòà**:**

""Let him feel left out ra... mana secret fun better!""  
(""Let him feel left out... our secret fun is better!"")

They both **ignored John** completely,  
giggling like naughty sisters,  
switching fully back to Telugu.

  


**Sureka Starts Teasing Again (Sweetly + Shamelessly):**

**Sureka** üî•**:**

""Ra Laxmi... beach pic lo... nee buttocks full HD lo shining laga vunnayi... proud ga feel avvali ra!""  
(""Laxmi... your buttocks were shining in full HD in the beach pic... you should feel proud!"")

**Sureka** üòÇ**:**

""Beach lo local boys pakkana undaga... camera lekapoyina... they already undressed you with their eyes ra!""  
(""Even without cameras, the local boys at the beach had already undressed you with their eyes!"")

**Laxmi** üå∏ **(blushing, shy typing):**

""Akkaaa... nenu chala cheap ga feel aipotunna... enduku ila avvutondi naaku...""  
(""Akkaaa... I still feel so cheap... why am I becoming like this..."")

**Sureka** üòç**:**

""Cheap? Ra crazy girl... idi real boldness! Real woman ante body ni accept cheyatam, flaunt cheyatam!""  
(""Cheap? You crazy girl... this is real boldness! A real woman accepts her body and flaunts it!"")

**Sureka** üëë**:**

""Stretch marks, C-section scar, sagging, drunken madness ‚Äî anni mana story part ra! Dairyam ante idi!""  
(""Stretch marks, C-section scars, sagging, drunken madness ‚Äî it‚Äôs all part of our story! This is what real courage means!"")

  


**Laxmi's Heart Softens... and Pride Sparks:**

Slowly,  
Laxmi wiped her tears again...  
but this time she was **smiling**.

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard,  
then typed:

**Laxmi** üå∏**:**

""Akka... nenu ippudu proud ga feel chesthunnanu... nenu na flaws tho kuda beautiful anipistundi.""  
(""Akka... I'm finally feeling proud... I feel beautiful even with my flaws."")

**Sureka** üíñ **(excited):**

""Yessss ra cutie queen! Idhe spirit! Full body love, full memory love!""  
(""Yessss cutie queen! This is the spirit! Full body love, full memory love!"")

**Sureka** üî•**:**

""Next party lo... bikini remove cheyyali... full natural photoshoot! üòà""  
(""Next party... you should remove the bikini too... full natural photoshoot! üòà"")

**Laxmi** üå∏ **(shy but playful):**

""Akkaaa... chalu ra... inka excitement handle cheyyalekapothunnanu...""  
(""Akkaaa... stop it... I can't handle more excitement now..."")

They both laughed together ‚Äî  
warm, mischievous, happy.

Their bond, woven tighter by shame, courage, boldness, madness ‚Äî  
**now blooming into pure sisterhood**.

  


Meanwhile, in the main group chat,  
**John** had sent a confused emoji:

""??? üòÖ You girls plotting something?""

They both just smiled at their screens,  
completely ignoring him again,  
lost in their own wild, spicy, beautiful world. üå∏

  


  


*VERY* fun weekend! üòÇüòÇ""

The whole group **erupted into laughter**.

  


üå∏ **Everyone Dying Laughing** üå∏

**Sureka** üòÇ**:**

""John full energy drain ayipoyadu ra first day nunchi! üòÇ""

**Laxmi** üå∏**:**

""Nenu ayipoya akka... John kuda ayipoyadu... beach lo lock lo... ü§£""

**John** ‚ù§Ô∏è**:**

(Just spamming the chat with laughing faces, clapping emojis, and hearts.)

**Prasad** üòÇ**:**

""Need to book another beach house fast... illa ante next party ki energy ledu ra! üçª""

  


üå∏ **Mood at the End**

The car was filled with **Laxmi's soft, helpless giggles**,  
the phone buzzing nonstop,  
the Nashville Friends group **overflowing with laughter, teasing, crazy love**.

Me, still driving ‚Äî heart pounding, face burning ‚Äî  
but a slow smile creeping over my face too.

Because somehow...  
this madness... this chaos...  
felt like the most **wildly beautiful memory** we'd ever created together. üå∏

  


üå∏ **Private Chat Explodes - John Gets Angry** üå∏

While Sureka and Laxmi were laughing and bonding in Telugu,  
John started getting annoyed.

**John** üò† **(main group chat):**

""If you guys don't talk in English, I'll send one more pic! üò°""

Laxmi and Sureka both paused, looked at each other through their phones,  
then typed at the same time ‚Äî bold, fearless, wicked smiles on their faces:

**Sureka** üòà**:**

""Go ahead ra! üòò What else is there to hide now?""

**Laxmi** üå∏ **(giggling):**

""Yeah John... no secrets anymore! üòú""

John didn‚Äôt wait even a second ‚Äî with devilish confidence, he uploaded one more bomb photo.

  


üì∏ **New Photo Sent:**

* From the very first night at the beach house.
* Laxmi‚Äôs bare back, nude and glowing under the moonlight.
* Her mouth wrapped around the chastity lock at my waist.
* A teasing, intimate moment ‚Äî raw, shameless, wild.
* The angle was artistic but extremely suggestive ‚Äî only her messy hair, bare back, and the lock against her lips were visible ‚Äî but anyone could guess exactly what was happening.

  


üå∏ **Group Explodes Again** üå∏

The entire Nashville Friends group froze for a second ‚Äî  
nobody typed ‚Äî  
shock and wild excitement buzzing in the air.

And then, Sureka couldn't control herself ‚Äî  
she burst out laughing so hard in the chat:

**Sureka** üòÇüî•**:**

""Ayoooo super akka pic! üòÇüî• Loved the way you locked him! Looks like fun ra!""  
(""Oh my God! Super akka pic! üòÇüî• Loved the way you locked him! Looks like pure fun!"")

**Sureka** üòà**:**

""First day nunchi full wild queen ra neeku title! üëë""  
(""From the first day itself, you were a full wild queen!"")

**John** üçª**:**

""Told you girls! Don't mess with me! üòÇüòÇ""

**Prasad** ‚ù§Ô∏è **(only one decent reply):**

""Chala sweet moments... memories for lifetime... ‚ù§Ô∏è""  
(""Very sweet moments... memories for a lifetime... ‚ù§Ô∏è"")

  


üå∏ **Laxmi's Reaction: From Shock to Laughter** üå∏

Meanwhile me ‚Äî  
I was frozen at the wheel, blood rushing in my ears,  
absolutely dead inside when I saw that pic being shared openly.  
How would I ever face Prasad next time?!

But beside me,  
Laxmi had gone through the shock...  
and now she was laughing ‚Äî soft, helpless giggles escaping her lips.

She leaned her forehead against the car window, tears streaming ‚Äî  
this time from laughter.

**Laxmi** üå∏ **(typing, laughing):**

""Akkaaa... nenu emi queen ra... complete idiot ni... üòÇ""  
(""Akkaaa... I'm not a queen... I'm a complete idiot... üòÇ"")

**Sureka** üòç**:**

""Nee idiocy valla andaram enjoy chestunnam! üòà Proud of you ra slutty queen!""  
(""Because of your 'idiocy', all of us are having fun! üòà Proud of you, slutty queen!"")

Everyone kept dropping emojis ‚Äî  
üî•‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇüçª ‚Äî filling the chat with laughter, teasing, love, madness.

Even though the photos were crazy, bold, wild ‚Äî  
the atmosphere turned into something sweet, open, unforgettable.

And Laxmi...  
for the first time, sitting next to me, bare thighs trembling,  
head still foggy with shame and wildness...  
smiled proudly to herself.

No more hiding.  
No more fear.  
Only wild memories and unbreakable bonds. üå∏

  


üå∏ **Aftermath: Sureka's Wild Roasting Continues** üå∏

After the shocking ""lock photo"" dropped,  
the group was on fire.

Laxmi was half-crying, half-laughing in the car seat, face burning hot.  
I could barely focus on driving anymore ‚Äî my hands sweaty on the wheel.

But **Sureka** ‚Äî  
Sureka was just getting started.  
Her wild tongue spared no one ‚Äî not even me!

**Sureka** üòÇüî•**:**

""Akkaaa... lock anta tiny undhi... nenu shock ayya ra!""  
(""Akkaaa... the lock is so tiny... I was actually shocked!"")

**Sureka** üòà**:**

""Ee tiny lock lo fit ayyindi ante... ayyayyooo... size guess cheyyachu kada! üòÇüòÇ""  
(""If it fit in that tiny lock... ayyayyo... we can guess the size right! üòÇüòÇ"")

**Sureka** üíÄ**:**

""Akka lock chupisthe... mallliyya... inka lock ki size compare chesthunnaanu... ü§£ü§£ü§£""  
(""Akka, after seeing the lock, I keep comparing sizes in my head... ü§£ü§£ü§£"")

**Sureka** üòàüî•**:**

""Nuvvu full enjoy chestunnav... adey biggest victory ra! Lock kanna feel strong undali... adhey ma motto! üî•üòÇ""  
(""You're fully enjoying... that's the biggest victory! The feeling should be bigger than the lock... that's our motto! üî•üòÇ"")

  


üå∏ **Laxmi's Sweet, Shy Response** üå∏

Laxmi‚Äôs hands shook as she typed, face flushed,  
tears still leaking from laughing too hard:

**Laxmi** üå∏ **(typing slowly, giggling):**

""Akka... lock size gurinchi matladakandi ra... chala baadha padthunaru already! üòÇ""  
(""Akka... please don't talk about the lock size anymore... he's already suffering a lot! üòÇ"")

**Sureka** üòà **(instantly):**

""Awww chinni lock boy! ü•∫ We love you ra... small but mighty! üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è""

**John** ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è**:**  
(Just sending dozens of laughing faces, hearts, and thumbs up emojis ‚Äî fully enjoying the roasting.)

  


üå∏ **Prasad Adds His Cheeky Comment** üå∏

Out of nowhere, Prasad ‚Äî  
who had been trying to stay decent ‚Äî  
suddenly dropped a naughty comment:

**Prasad** üòÇüçª**:**

""Looks like John had a *VERY* fun weekend! üòÇüòÇ""

The whole group **erupted into laughter** again ‚Äî  
fire emojis, hearts, drinks, nonstop messages.

The energy between all of us ‚Äî  
bold, mad, sweet, unforgettable ‚Äî  
was now **something we would remember forever**. üå∏

  
  
üå∏ **Wild Return Drive: Roasting, Laughing, and Memories** üå∏

After the second ""lock photo"" explosion,  
the car fell into a wild rhythm ‚Äî  
laughing, teasing, roasting ‚Äî non-stop for hours.

Laxmi was still wiping her eyes, still giggling at herself.  
And Sureka ‚Äî oh, Sureka was on absolute FIRE ‚Äî  
she was loving every second of this open humiliation.

  


**Sureka** üòà **(laughing hard):**

""**Akkaaaa... seriously... chinna lock boy and giant queen combo ra...** üòÇüî• **Match made in mad heaven!**""

**Laxmi** üå∏ **(mock pride):**

""**Naa luck ra akka... enti size enti lock... anni settle ayindi** üòÇüòÇ""  
(""My luck akka... whatever the size, whatever the lock... everything got settled üòÇüòÇ"")

They kept roasting me about the tiny lock,  
imagining **""how difficult it must have been""** for Laxmi to even notice it...  
and how she had to be **""extra careful""** not to lose it **""inside somewhere""**! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ

**Sureka** üòÇ**:**

""**Seriously ra... chinna lock... pedda queen... adey life gurinchi biggest joke!** ü§£""

**Laxmi** üå∏ **(giggling and teasing):**

""**Naa jivitham lo biggest adventure ra... lock size to patu patience kooda develop avuthundi!** üòÇ""  
(""Biggest adventure of my life... along with the lock size, my patience also developed! üòÇ"")

Every 10 minutes,  
Sureka would find a new creative way  
to mock the lock, mock the ""size"", mock the situation ‚Äî  
and Laxmi would sweetly, shamelessly, proudly respond ‚Äî  
enjoying her ""wild queen"" crown now. üëë

  


üå∏ **John's Secret Pics Reveal (Kind of)** üå∏

At one point, Sureka poked John in the chat ‚Äî grinning wickedly:

**Sureka** üî• **(mock commanding):**

""**Oye John! If you have any secret pics left, drop them right now ra!** üòÇ""

**John** üçª **(calmly replied):**

""I didn't take any pics that night... other than what I already sent Laxmi. Promise.""

Everyone went silent for a second.

**Laxmi** üå∏ **(narrowing her eyes, teasing):**

""Are you sure ra? You were drunk too... maybe you forgot?""

**John** üòè **(playfully teasing):**

""Maybe... after Laxmi fell asleep... I clicked a few... but nothing bad... just cute sleeping pics.""

**Sureka** üòà **(fake shouting in the chat):**

""**AYYOOO!** üò± **SECRET PICS EXIST??!! LAXMI KILL HIM!!** üòÇüî•""

**Laxmi** üå∏ **(pretending angry):**

""**John!!!** üò° **How dare you!! Unseen pics aa?!** üò§""

**John** üçª **(laughing, sending emojis):**

""Chill chill... you look like a sleeping angel ra... no naughty stuff... just memories.""

That revelation blew up the chat again ‚Äî  
Sureka screaming for the secret pics,  
Laxmi hiding her face in her hands,  
me... just driving, sweating, feeling smaller and smaller in the seat. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ

  


üå∏ **Passing the Torch: Sureka and Prasad's Turn** üå∏

Our wild hotel stay had finally come to an end.  
The chaos, the dares, the mad laughter ‚Äî all packed away with our sandy clothes and burnt skin.

We were checking out of the hotel ‚Äî  
tired, happy, still giggling over memories ‚Äî  
when we bumped into a surprise at the lobby.

**Sureka and Prasad** ‚Äî  
all fresh, glowing, smiling ‚Äî  
were checking in, suitcases in hand, sunglasses perched stylishly on their heads.

They looked ready for a **movie-style vacation** ‚Äî  
totally opposite to the madness we had just survived! üòÇ

  


**Sureka** üòà **(grinning as she saw us):**

""**Oyy... tired faces!** ü§≠ **Our turn now ra!**""

**Laxmi** üå∏ **(laughing, nudging me):**

""**Akkaaa... careful! E place lo full naughty energy left behind undhi...** üòú""  
(""Akkaaa... careful! We've left a lot of naughty energy behind in this place... üòú"")

**Prasad** ‚ù§Ô∏è **(chuckling, polite as ever):**

""**No worries... we'll keep it peaceful... hopefully!** üòÖ""

We laughed, exchanged quick hugs,  
gave them the ""**good luck surviving each other**"" look,  
and then ‚Äî with heavy but happy hearts ‚Äî  
we dragged ourselves back to the car and started the long drive home.

  


üå∏ **Sureka and Prasad: New Adventures Begin** üå∏

As we drove away,  
Sureka messaged the group chat:

**Sureka** üòàüî•**:**

""**Beach madness batch leaving... couple's honeymoon batch entering!** üòÇüòÇüî•""

**Laxmi** üå∏ **(replying immediately, still in giggles):**

""**Enjoy ra akkaaa... but careful... hotel lo cameras untayyy!** üòÇ""  
(""Enjoy akkaaa... but careful... hotels have cameras! üòÇ"")

**Sureka** üòà **(winking):**

""**Don't worry! We'll be decent outside... indecent inside!** üòàüî•""

And just like that,  
while we started winding down from our wild storm,  
**Sureka and Prasad's** own little ""**vacation storm**"" was just beginning... üå∏üíã",1,1745806725.0,fcouple2047,0,1.0,True

üí• **Breakfast Mood**

I sat there ‚Äî caged, throbbing, mind spinning ‚Äî  
as my wild, blushing Karri calmly finished her eggs, her bare foot teasing along my trapped cock, her sundress fluttering higher with every little shift.

Outside, the Virginia Beach sun sparkled across the water.  
Inside me, something wild and irreversible was breaking open.

Karri wasn‚Äôt just my shy wife anymore.  
She was transforming.  
Becoming something powerful.  
Something unstoppable.  
And I couldn't ‚Äî wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äî stop her even if I tried.

  


üî• **Day 2 ‚Äî Private Beach: New Rules**

After that electric breakfast, Karri was a woman reborn.

Still sweet.  
Still blushing when she smiled.  
But now?  
Dangerous. Bold. Wicked.

John had booked us a private beach cabana.  
When we arrived, the beach was nearly empty ‚Äî miles of soft sand, sun, and endless blue water.

Karri wore a tiny two-piece bikini John had gifted her:  
A soft peach-pink top ‚Äî so thin her dusky nipples pushed shamelessly through.  
A micro-thong bottom that disappeared between her thick brown thighs.

As I was setting up towels, she leaned close to me and whispered:

‚ÄúToday... you‚Äôre just my assistant, baby.  
John will take care of me.‚Äù

And before I could even react, she laughed, tossed her hair, and ran toward the water ‚Äî  
John chasing after her like a predator.

I stood frozen, heart pounding, my caged cock throbbing helplessly inside my jeans.

  


üî• **Beach Play Turns Wild**

John caught her easily ‚Äî lifting her into the waves, his hands roaming her slick, sun-warmed skin.  
Karri shrieked, wrapping her legs tightly around his waist ‚Äî  
forgetting everything except the thrill of the moment.

The wet bikini clung to her curves, making every inch of her breathtaking body impossible to miss.

At one point, John spun her around playfully ‚Äî  
and her thong slipped, flashing the curve of her beautiful ass.

Karri only gasped, buried her face against his neck, blushing... but never pulling away.

I stood there, pretending to fiddle with a drink ‚Äî  
but my eyes never, ever left them.

  


üî• **Private Husband and Wife Moments**

Later, they returned to the cabana.

Karri dropped onto John‚Äôs lap as if it was the most natural thing in the world.  
His hands immediately wrapped around her waist, stroking her sun-kissed, sore skin.

She glanced at me ‚Äî sweet, innocent ‚Äî but her eyes sparkled with wicked joy.

‚ÄúHubby, can you get me a cocktail, please?‚Äù

I nodded and stumbled off toward the beach bar, leaving them alone.

When I turned to glance back ‚Äî  
I caught it:

* Karri, leaning in.
* Whispering something against John's ear.
* Pressing a slow, lingering kiss against his neck.

Open. Shameless. Beautiful.

  


üî• **The Ultimate Shift**

When I returned, John was rubbing suntan lotion all over her body ‚Äî  
his hands wandering low, stroking her inner thighs, squeezing her ass casually, confidently.

Karri just lay there, eyes closed, smiling softly... accepting it all.

When he finished, she sat up ‚Äî her voice a breathy purr:

‚ÄúThank you, hubby...‚Äù

Then she turned to me with a little smile:

‚ÄúYou too, baby. You're such a good helper.‚Äù

My heart shattered and rebuilt itself all at once.

The roles had flipped.  
Completely.  
Irrevocably.

And Karri loved every second of it.

  


üî• **Sunset Walk ‚Äî Public Teasing**

As the sun slipped toward the horizon, John took Karri for a walk along the waterline.

She wore only his oversized beach shirt ‚Äî and nothing else.

Each step, the breeze lifted the hem, flashing bare thighs, bare ass cheeks ‚Äî teasing anyone lucky enough to look.

They held hands.  
Whispered.  
Shared soft kisses under the fiery sky ‚Äî like lovers on their honeymoon.

I trailed behind them ‚Äî carrying towels and bags ‚Äî  
watching my gorgeous wife glow in another man‚Äôs arms.

And the most intoxicating part?

She kept glancing back at me.  
That same shy, wicked smile on her face.

Loving how helpless ‚Äî and hopelessly hers ‚Äî she had made me.

  


üåô **Final Night ‚Äî Secret Unlocked**

That night, back at the hotel, the air crackled with heat.

Karri slipped into a soft, silky white nightgown ‚Äî sheer, clinging to every curve.  
No bra. No panties.  
Just temptation, pure and dangerous.

John lounged on the sofa, beer in hand, radiating casual dominance.  
And me?  
Still locked.  
Still desperate.  
Still utterly devoted.

Karri smiled ‚Äî sweet, mischievous ‚Äî and called me over.

‚ÄúBaby... come here.‚Äù

I knelt by the bed, heart pounding.

She dangled her thali chain in front of me ‚Äî the sacred chain she wore around her neck ‚Äî  
and hanging from it, brushing her breasts all day, was the tiny key to my chastity device.

The key.

It had been there.  
All.  
Day.

Karri‚Äôs smile deepened as she gently unhooked the chain.

But instead of handing it to me ‚Äî  
she walked to John.  
Placed the key in his hand.  
Closed his fingers around it.

‚ÄúTake good care of it tonight,‚Äù  
she whispered.

John smirked, slow and sure, and tucked the key into his pocket.

And in that instant, I understood:

* Karri had handed my chastity ‚Äî and her body ‚Äî over completely.
* She had given John control.
* And she had *wanted* it.

My cock strained painfully inside the cage, my heart pounding even harder.

There was no going back.

  


üåô **Final Night ‚Äî Karri‚Äôs Confession**

Later, in the darkened room, everything slowed.

Karri slipped into bed beside me ‚Äî wearing only a tiny lace panty, her thali chain glinting against her dusky skin.

She curled into my arms ‚Äî trembling slightly ‚Äî pressing her face against my chest.

The cage around me ached, yes ‚Äî  
but my heart... it overflowed.

And then ‚Äî  
in a small, broken whisper ‚Äî she said:

""Wherever I go... whatever I do...  
End of the day, I only want to come back and sleep next to you.""

""You are the love of my life.""

""And this thali you tied around my neck... it‚Äôs my proof.""

""No matter what happens ‚Äî you are my husband, my home, my forever.""

And then ‚Äî  
Karri began to cry.

Soft, heart-wrenching sobs soaking into my chest.  
Tears for the wildness.  
The guilt.  
The freedom.  
The madness of the past two days.  
Tears for the deep, sacred bond we had strengthened ‚Äî against all odds.

I tightened my arms around her, kissed her hair, whispered into the heavy, holy dark:

""I love you, Karri.  
Always. Only you.""

We lay there ‚Äî  
No cages.  
No strangers.  
No fear.

Just two souls ‚Äî tangled together ‚Äî  
closer than ever before.

  


**Morning Chaos ‚Äî Coffee, Comforters, and Shameless Eyes**

The next morning, sunlight streamed through the balcony doors.  
The soft scent of coffee filled the room.

I was still deep in sleep, but Karri slowly woke up.  
Her eyes fluttered open ‚Äî and immediately, she froze.

There was John ‚Äî  
sitting casually in the corner chair, fully dressed, sipping his coffee, a mischievous smirk playing on his lips.  
And we?  
We were completely naked, tangled together on the bed.

Karri gasped softly, instinctively trying to pull the comforter over us.  
In her sleepy panic, she only managed to cover me ‚Äî  
leaving her gorgeous dusky back completely exposed,  
her bare ass peeking through the folds,  
and her golden thali chain dangling and sparkling down her naked spine. ‚ú®

John just smiled, not saying a word, leisurely sipping his coffee, his eyes devouring the view.  
He set a second cup down beside me.

I stirred awake, groggy, confused ‚Äî until I realized the situation.  
Karri gave me a helpless, shy look ‚Äî cheeks flushed dark ‚Äî  
but I couldn't help but smile.  
I grabbed the coffee and sat up in bed, still under the comforter...  
but as I adjusted, the blanket slipped.

My entire back and ass were exposed too.

The room was thick with silent electricity ‚Äî  
John, sipping his coffee, enjoying the early-morning, wild, unfiltered view of us:  
naked, tangled, raw, still glowing from the night before.

We made small talk ‚Äî about breakfast plans, about checkout timing ‚Äî  
pretending like everything was normal.  
But the air was anything but normal. üî•

As we chatted, John casually leaned back in his chair, his coffee cup cradled in his hand.  
With a lazy grin, he finally said:

""Karri... If you want his freedom, there‚Äôs just one small condition.""

He pulled a small, sleek bag from beside his chair and dropped it onto the bed.

""Wear the dress I picked... just for you. After that, you get the keys.""

Karri glanced at me, then at John ‚Äî her cheeks still warm, her thali chain swinging gently against her chest as she shifted under the comforter.  
For a second, she hesitated.  
Then, slowly, with a soft, wicked smile, she nodded:

""Okay, John... deal.""

John‚Äôs eyes glittered with mischief as he tossed the tiny key across the bed ‚Äî landing it gently near Karri‚Äôs thigh.  
She picked it up carefully, holding it between her fingers.  
Her hand trembled slightly ‚Äî from excitement, from nerves, from the delicious weight of the moment.

She turned to me.  
Our eyes locked.  
Without a word, she shifted closer, pulling away the comforter that barely shielded her body.

There she was ‚Äî naked, golden, wild ‚Äî sitting back on her heels.  
The sunlight caught the curves of her breasts, the soft gleam of her skin, the dangling shimmer of her thali swaying above her bare belly.

I was throbbing so hard inside the cage it hurt.  
But I stayed perfectly still, breathing hard, trembling slightly.

Karri leaned down between my legs, her soft fingers finding the tiny lock.  
As she worked the key into it, her mouth brushed lightly against the cold steel of my chastity device ‚Äî  
and with a helpless moan from deep in my throat, I leaked onto her bare chest.  
Milky drops slid across her dusky areoles, clinging to the dark peaks of her nipples, and dripping down her flat belly.

John watched ‚Äî silent, intense ‚Äî sipping his coffee like he was watching a masterpiece unfold.

Karri, cheeks flushed, bit her lip but didn‚Äôt stop.  
She finally heard the soft click of the cage unlocking.

At that moment, my cock sprang free ‚Äî hard, throbbing, aching ‚Äî  
and another thin, sticky thread landed across Karri‚Äôs breast and tangled lightly into her hair.

The room was filled with nothing but soft breathing and a thick, burning silence.

John chuckled lowly.

""Well, damn... Looks like someone really missed their wife.""

Karri laughed too ‚Äî a shy, sweet, sexy sound ‚Äî as she grabbed the fallen comforter and threw it over herself, finally breaking the heavy spell.

I sat there ‚Äî free, exposed, helplessly in love with the woman kneeling before me,  
her body painted with my need, her eyes shining with bold, dangerous affection.
