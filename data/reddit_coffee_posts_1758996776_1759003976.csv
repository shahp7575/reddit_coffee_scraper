1ns4zzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyTexas/comments/1ns4zzp/heb_swoon_brand_ice_cream/,H-E-B Swoon brand ice cream,"Decided to post this here since both HEB & Blue Bell have Texas roots. If you're like me (huge fan of Blue Bell ice cream), you'll want to discover the Swoon brand at HEB. I think equals the flavor & quality of Blue Bell. Swoon currently has 22 flavors but only comes in pints sizes. I'm in the process of working my way thru their flavors. So far I've tried:

Mexican Hot Chocolate Rocky Road - it's a Rocky Road w/ a kick. My favorite so far & it must be a lot of others' favorite too since it was the only one completely sold out during my store trip yesterday. It was the main item on my list since my nephew discovered my stash, laying waste to it & I needed to restock. Put a little of it on a warm brownie & you'll think you've died & gone to heaven.

Banana S'Mores - if you love banana pudding, you're going to love this.

Columbian Coffee Toffee - a delicious combo.

Coffee - it's as good of a plain coffee ice cream as I ever tasted, but after eating the Columbia Toffee, I'm really thinking about crushing up some Heath Toffee bars to mix in it & make it special.

Cherry Pistachio - I was expecting pistachio ice cream w/ bits of cherry, so I was disappointed to find it was the opposite. I'm not a big fan of cherry ice cream but my nephew called this morning raving about how good it was, so I know mine isn't going to go to waste.

Pecan Praline - it definitely rivals BB's Pecan Pralines 'n Cream but BB also comes in a 1/2 gallon.

Their other flavors are: Butter Pecan, Cookie Lovers, Cookies & Cream, Salted Caramel Truffle, Caramel Bourbon Almond, Texas Brownie a la Mode, Brownie Batter Dough, Mint Chip Brownie, Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake, Mixed Berry Cheesecake, Pumpkin Cheesecake, Red Velvet Cheesecake, Strawberry Cheesecake, Key Lime Pie, Triple Chocolate, & of course Vanilla.",1,1759003790.0,ActuallyTexas,0,1.0,False
1ns4ztz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietsoda/comments/1ns4ztz/were_going_to_get_your_soda_intake_down_no_were/,“We’re going to get your soda intake down.” No we’re not.,"You would think one of the multiple doctors I’ve had this conversation with would have made some kind of bold note in my file about this by now. It’s frustrating. 

Every time I meet with a new healthcare provider it’s the same conversation. It doesn’t matter what we’re meeting for, the soda question is part of general intake. They’re shocked when I tell them 2-4 liters of diet soda a day is my average, with an effort to match or exceed that with water. They apparently never hear the word “diet” and make a remark about how much sugar I’m drinking. I tell them it’s diet, they make a comment that I need water too, I tell them I literally just said I try to drink 1:1 water:soda. They realize I’m not going to be cooperative about this and move on to what we actually need to talk about. 

By the end of the appointment they’re smiling again and happily say something along the lines of “and we’ll talk about drinking less soda next time we meet.” I’ve had this conversation so many times that I basically tell them we’re never having that conversation unless I’m guaranteed to drop dead tomorrow from diet soda specifically. No doctor has given me a legitimate reason to quit or lessen. I have chronic fatigue that hasn’t been fixed by medication or lifestyle changes so caffeine isn’t fucking optional for me. It’s not safe for someone to stumble through every single day hoping they don’t fall asleep while driving. 

Why do I refuse to even talk about drinking less diet soda? Because I know I’m not going to do it. My time with the doctor is limited and valuable, I refuse to waste it by making game plans I’ll never follow or discuss aspects of my life that aren’t currently affecting my health. 

Believe me, regular people can be annoying as hell about it too. It’s just I don’t plan 1 hour with this person 3 months ahead of time just to get sidetracked by their obsession with my soda intake. 
- “Aspartame is worse for you than sugar!!!” I would be the most diabetic person in earth right now if I didn’t drink diet. I’m currently 0% diabetic. 
- “All that salt is bad for you!!!” My diet soda intake has been this high for years now. The most recent test on my sodium levels was: LOW SODIUM. Clearly I’m not getting excess salt from the soda. 
- “That much soda is expensive!!!” Coffee is disgusting so I don’t spend $6 a day on one 12oz drink, Barbara. Off-brand diet 2lt bottles are around $1 at Walmart. Do the math. I’m spending less money and drinking less sugar than most Starbucks customers, leave me alone and bother them instead.

1ns4ztk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ns4ztk/ran_into_boyfriends_32m_ex_33f_and_had_to_spend/,Ran into boyfriend’s ’32M’ ex ‘33F’ and had to spend hours next to her,"I‘26/F’ have been dating my boyfriend‘32/M’ (let’s call him Alex) for about 4 months now, and we’re already talking about getting engaged. Before me, he was in a very long relationship(they were together for 10 years and engaged for the last 5 of them). She’33F’ ended the relationship after cheating on him with the man’40M’ she is currently with.
A few months later, I moved into the apartment that Alex had been renting (about 3 months after their breakup). We started dating 2 months after they ended things, and by that time, she was already in her new relationship. So, there’s no overlap and we didn’t do anything wrong.
Last night we went to a pub quiz with two of Alex’s friends. By coincidence, his ex showed up with her new boyfriend (the guy she cheated with) and two of their friends. They ended up sitting right next to us.
When they walked in, Alex went over and greeted them briefly, just to avoid making things awkward, then came back to our table. We stayed there for around 4 hours. The entire time, she completely ignored not just me, but also Alex’s friends (who actually know her too). She acted like our whole group was invisible, while constantly laughing really loudly throughout the night.
When we were leaving, she made a joke to Alex but still didn’t acknowledge me at all. It felt very intentional and disrespectful. And that made Alex very upset but he kept it cool and wished the whole group luck and we left. 
This wasn’t even the first time we ran into her. On a previous occasion, she also ignored me, and later messaged him saying she was just “surprised,” which is why she acted that way.
After last night, she sent him three separate messages in a row:
First, again saying she was just “so surprised” and that it was “an awkward night.”
Then, adding that she didn’t greet me because she thought I wouldn’t want her to, and that she was trying to “respect my boundaries.”
Finally, she asked if he even cares about her feelings, and said that he immediately moved in with me into the beautiful home she loved, and that now we are living there together.
She also once asked him to meet for coffee, but he told her no that he’s in a new relationship now and wants to focus on me.
Next week, there’s already a plan for them to meet briefly so he can return some of her belongings he found in his car. Alex thinks her behavior was extremely rude, and he completely understands how uncomfortable she made me feel. 

So here’s my question: How would you handle this? why do you think she’s acting this way? Has anyone been in a similar situation with a partner’s ex?

The Christmas fix 3.5/5 how i realised that romance bores me and finding out the hard way that I’m not comefortable reading erotic parts of books, but also the only actually decent romance book i have ever read

The before the coffee gets cold series: 4/6 books read so far: the series that got me back into reading after years of not reading. Simply put the perfect balance of so many themes. 4.5/5 (so far)

The heart: the most tragic book i have ever read, super super dense, but a great read, but would prefer not to go down the dense in langauge/super confusing route
4.75/5

The tourist: my first spy novel, and the most confusing book i have ever read i have ever read in my entire life: 
Litrelly gave me headaches for weeks. My longest standing read so far, but great characters, amazingly written, amazingly complex and Rich storyline, and very dark. 4.3/5

A Mrs miricle Christmas: 
4.4, but one of the most enjoyable books on this list. it was warm, welcoming, magical, a little spiritual and religous with some religous references, simply perfect, and suprised that the romance was tied in a meaningful way, instead of in a simple and boring way it makes the top 5 of books that i have finished this year. 

The big year:
Enjoyable, entertaining, somewhat intresting storylines, very well written, and a solid middle ground for me. A little too dense on the pacing and bird facts, but otherwise very enjoyable and engaging. 4.3/5

The sound of a wild snail eating:
Very enjoyable read, but i didn’t understand the moral and pylosophical connection between snails and and life about a 3rd of the time. 4.1./10

The starless sea:
My only DNF of the year. I will admit that the writing is really really good in this book, and the only book that i really really loved but also really really really hated at the same time at the same level on this list. It was so uncanny and offbeat and creepy that it actually made me physically uncomfortable. It actually made me say “NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.” Out loud. 4/5

Call me Mrs miricle: 
Really dissapointed with this one. Still a great read, but 70 percent of the books was all a hallmark romance, and it really bored me. It saves itself a couple of points at the end where it incrparates a bit of really really sweet and comforting and magical and just perfect magic, but otherwise dissapointing. Therefore it earns the lowest rating out of all of them.
3/5

A curious incident of the dog in the nighttime:
A mixed bag. So mixed in fact that it even mostly drops the seemingly centraln theme halfway through, and goes off about something seemingly unrelated at that point in the book. The books also has one of the worst characters out there for me. Super toxic and emotionally abusive father, witch as an autistic person felt like it hit s bit too close to home. Otherwise, a well written book and gets more exciting towards the end witch kept me gripped, easy wording, and a satifying resolution.
4.1/5

My sister’s keeper:
A very very well written but, but i failed to feel significant empathy for some of the characters because they act like ethier they don’t realise or are oblivious or compleatly ignorant to thier wrongdoing. Unfortunatly i accidently spoiled part of the ending for myself like a quarter of the way through, but the other part of the ending i did not see coming and throughly enjoyed. Very emotional, heart wrenching, sweet and tender, but also caotic and satisfying. loved this one 4.75/5.

These are all the significant reads from this year. You don’t have to read all this but if you did, Thank you. ❤️",1,1759003508.0,suggestmeabook,0,1.0,False

1ns4tj1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ns4tj1,Parklife removed from Best Of CD?,"I was going to buy the Best Of (Deluxe Version) CD on Blur’s official website store, and I noticed something odd.

When I went to Apple Music’s Best Of (Deluxe Version), I wanted to make sure all songs on there were the same on Apple Music, as on the CD.

I noticed #6 on Apple Music is Parklife, one of my favorites.

When I checked #6 on Blur’s website on the track list of the CD, it’s says #6 is  “Revolution (1999 Remaster)” by Tomorrow.

This isn’t a bad song, but why is it on their album? It’s not by them. Also, why remove Parklife, one of their most popular songs, and switch it out for a random song?

Another question I have, which is way less of a concern, is this:

#10 on Apple Music is Girls and Boys.

On their CD it says Girls and Boys (7” Mix).

I was just wondering if this meant it was longer or shorter or just in general how they were different.

Everything else (song wise) seems the same, though.

Several months ago, I quit completely. I had maybe 3 days of feeling slightly on edge, but never really felt bad or any discomfort. I missed the feeling of nicotine with my morning coffee or as I read before bed, but soon realized that I felt better overall without it. Going from using it throughout the day to no nicotine, I feel considerably less stress throughout the day and higher energy levels.

I always enjoyed putting a zyn (6mg) in while I did my reading before bed. After 9 months without nicotine, I did so again. Read for an hour with nicotine, took it out, went to sleep. 

I track my sleep with a garmin watch, and that night had a considerably higher sleep score (I usually get a 60 something with 6 hours of sleep on a weeknight. With nicotine it was in the 90s).

Ive experimented back and forth and the results are seemingly clear. One 6mg zyn at bedtime and I always have a much higher sleep score than the nights without. Even when I get MORE sleep without nicotine. I make sure that my bedtime routine, eating cutoff, no alcohol, etc are the same regardless.

I don't know if it's a placebo from seeing the score, but I feel better overall and better rested following the nights I use nicotine.

I kept burning out until I started doing a few simple things that really made a difference. Thought I’d share in case it helps anyone:

* **Time-blocking my week**: I plan out everything on Sunday, classes, work shifts, gym, even downtime. It’s way easier to stick to a plan when it’s written out.
*  **Micro-goals for assignments**: Instead of tackling an entire essay at once, I break it into small daily goals (like “write intro today” or “finish citations”).
*  **One non-academic thing daily**: I make time for a walk, a coffee with a friend or a show, something that reminds me life isn’t just assignments.
*  **Study sprints instead of marathons**: 25-30 minute focused sessions with short breaks helped me do more in less time.

I’m still figuring it out but these have honestly saved me from burning out completely. What’s one thing you do to keep school and life in balance?",1,1759002744.0,StudentLifeBalance,0,1.0,False

Honestly, it has gone quite well. I eat almost everything (except dairy and spicy foods) One day I even dared to have coffee, since I read it doesn’t cancel out the antibiotics, and everything was fine. I only had a few side effects: extreme fatigue and a horrible pressure in my ears and head. 

But now I’m on day 8/10. and I started having nausea and burping, and a cyst I have on a nerve has started hurting. Nausea was one of the symptoms I had before, but not the burping.

1ns4hu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1ns4hu3/explore_the_best_nugget_ice_maker_silonn_slim32t/,Explore the Best Nugget Ice Maker Silonn SLIM32T Worth Your Countertop?,"Using the Silonn SLIM32T nugget ice maker has been an interesting experience in my kitchen. As someone who enjoys chilled drinks all year round, ice quality plays a surprisingly significant role in my daily routine. Unboxing the nugget ice maker felt exciting—it’s not every day that an appliance promises such convenience and style. Crafted from stainless steel, the Silonn SLIM32T immediately struck me as sleek and modern, blending effortlessly with other kitchen gadgets on my countertop. While it markets itself as compact, I’d still recommend checking the dimensions to ensure it fits your space. With its pull-out water tank and a detachable ice basket, the setup felt straightforward, even for someone as occasionally impatient as me.

**Ease of Use and Design**  
One of the standout features of this ice maker is its pull-out water reservoir. I found this incredibly convenient, especially since I’m somewhat of a klutz with pouring water directly into fixed reservoirs. Refilling and cleaning were hassle-free, thanks to these removable parts. The LED control panel, enhanced by a calming blue light, was remarkably intuitive. Operating this appliance really boils down to pushing a simple button—no convoluted manuals required. That said, the stainless steel exterior adds a polished look to it, making it an aesthetically pleasing addition to any kitchen. However, the glossy finish does mean frequent wiping to keep fingerprints at bay.  

**Performance and Ice Quality**  
Performance-wise, this nugget ice maker lives up to its promises. Within ten minutes of powering it on, I was greeted by the first batch of chewable nugget ice. Daily, it churns out up to 44 pounds of ice, which is more than enough for hosting gatherings, iced coffees, and poolside weekends. The texture of the nugget ice is fantastic—it’s soft, chewable, and doesn’t dilute beverages quickly. This feature really stood out to my kids, who seem to love munching on the ice with their lemonade. The quick 10-minute cycle time was consistent throughout my testing, which impressed me. It’s worth noting that leaving the ice in the basket for extended periods tends to cause slight melting, but that’s expected for non-commercial ice makers.  

**Highlights**  
- The self-cleaning function made maintenance a dream. Just with a single press, the device goes into cleaning mode, saving time and frustration.  
- Removable basket and tank simplify both water refills and ice collection.  
- Rapid ice production keeps you prepared for unexpected guests or scorching summer afternoons.  

[Check Silonn SLIM32T price on Amazon.](https://chvnx.com/p/b0dpmf9v3q/)  

**Shortcomings**  
Some areas could benefit from improvement. For one, the motor, while not obnoxious, does emit a noticeable hum—comparable to a standard refrigerator sound. For folks who prioritize a very quiet environment, this might be worth considering. Additionally, while the LED panel is user-friendly, I wish there were more advanced functionality for adjusting ice settings, perhaps via a smartphone app or even some customization in ice size.  

- Slightly noticeable hum in operation, which might bother those looking for absolute silence.  
- Limited settings for tweaking ice size or production preferences.  

**Competing Brands**  
The countertop nugget ice maker market is undoubtedly competitive, and this one sits among notable peers like the GE Profile Opal and the Frigidaire Ice Maker. While these competitors may offer Wi-Fi connectivity and app integrations that grant control over ice production schedules, the Silonn SLIM32T counters with a more budget-friendly price range and simpler design. For me, its understated functionality holds enough appeal, though enthusiasts requiring app connectivity might lean toward the GE Profile’s more advanced features. Additionally, Frigidaire models often feature larger capacities, which might suit larger households better.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering this ice maker against some of its competitors, it’s apparent Silonn aimed to strike a balance between price and functionality. While you won’t find fancy tech extras here, the appliance delivers where it matters: speed, quality, and ease of operation. If premium bells and whistles are non-essential for you and all you need is crave-worthy nugget ice, this product fits the bill without breaking the budget.

It was their first time, and my fifth time.

The 3  day we went to a restaurant, and after dinner,   my fiancée uncle and her father decided they wanted to order the most expensive dessert (though, I must emphasize, it was a fairly cheap restaurant, and the dessert could easily have been bought by two people). It was basically a small chocolate fountain with cookies. Well... the problem was, I'd had it before. At this restaurant.  It was bad, the chocolate seemed old, and the cookies tasted like ash. So I said I pass and that I'm not hungry anymore.

They all ended up paying for dessert and eat it while I drank coffee but there was no problem with it back then, everyone seemed in a good mood etc... well, now it's September and it turns out my fiancée's father is  still angry with me for not saying a word about the quality of this dessert.  Ever since he accidentally found out I'd eaten this dessert before and didn't like it, he's been claiming I deliberately caused him gastric problems  and forced all of them to pay for something so bad. The others are either on my side or neutral.

Well, the thing is, he's not entirely wrong.  I mean, I didn't want him to have problems.

But the fact is, he was another reason I kept quiet.

I don't really know what he has against me, but in the past, whenever I tried to warn him about something or express my opinion on something... he did the complete opposite or tried to prove me wrong. Even during our trip, when I suggested where we should go, he constantly questioned my judgment. On the second day, we literally got lost because he thought I didn't have the right to remember how to get from our hotel to museum,  and  he, who had never been to Italy, knew better.

So, yes, I assumed that if I said something like ""this dessert is bad"" he would want to buy it even more and would even start complaining that I had bad taste.  And, like... The second day was awful, and I didn't want the third to end the same way. Besides, it's not like I made them eat everything. And as far as I know, no one else had stomach problems afterward.

But yes, I must admit I  still feel a little guilty.",16,1759002528.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,13,0.9,False

i can only imagine the looks of digust some people would wear while reading/looking at this
   🤷‍♀️  my food, my meat suit, my choice
 besides
i think it kinda works

  to me,
it's an edible meal on the go
   hence the chia seeds/hemp hearts

wtf does it taste like?
  about as weird as it kinda sounds 

it's definitely not great by any means
it's not bad either
  tastes a fuck lot better than a lot of prescription meds/etc i've had over the course of my life

things such as
  cough syrup
lunestra after-taste that lasts for days
   liquid barium

 fuck liquid barium
that ish is naaaaarrrstyyy
   ↪️  upper gi re: lap band insertion in 2009

 so yeah
i'll take the flavor of this in a heartbeat over that
   besides, like i said
  it really isn't bad
 i just need to tweak it some next time 🤷‍♀️

  but...
honey in coffee??

   look at it as honey in tea then
 idgaf
my cuppa

  i normally use honey in my tea
and sugar in my coffee

  it also amuses me and warms my heart in another way
while growing up,
   my mother tried her best to not actively curse in front of kids

she used to say ""sugar honey iced tea"" instead of shit
  i always loved that for so many reasons

 this might not be iced tea
but whatever, it makes me happy

  emotion aside,
lemme further unpack my logic in creating this concoction:

  all the stimulants i can shove into a single cup
packed with a buttload of natural anti-inflammatories 
  with added nutrition and nutrients 
and the added bonus of possibly being a true edible
  by the addition of the fresh permanent marker flower [marijuana]

but but
  i said fresh flower
  as in not yet dried out

   doesn't that mean it won't have psychoactive properties?


to touch on thermodynamics
  marijuana needs heat to draw out the thc/etc
  marijuana flower needs to be dried out in order to burn it 
     ↪️ moisture makes burning difficult otherwise
           #duh

  my thought?
liquid is wet
  #aka
    moist

perhaps if i use a drawn out low heat
  those psychoactive properties will indeed be drawn out as well

this yeti cup is amazeballs for heat retention
  especially when i add my coozy to it
 this bitch can stay hot for hours
especially if i leave it in my car in the jersey summer heat

so i slow drink this
  sips here & there
 to give it time to process
   
since i wanna keep the flower in it for now
  i'm drinking it while keeping the top tab closed
 not preferred, but at least i'm not accidentally eating the flower 😅🤦‍♀️



  okay,
this now taken care of

  lemme see if i can find my concentration 
and somehow manifest $250 within the next couple of hours

  i need to get shit done.

I’ve been using a water to coffee ratio of 16:1, which is what I use for my other methods.  I’ve made 3 brews now grinding finer and finer on my Baratza Encore. Started above 20 and this last cup I tried at 15 and it’s still very weak.  I grind my V60 around a 12 and my chemex around a 17 on my grinder.  
My method:
I been doing a bloom on the French press and then a steep for 4 minutes. I check for any floating grinds to stir or scoop in, but haven’t seen any with any of my grind sizes. Then I steep for another 4 minutes. 8 total.  
I’ve had no silt in my cups, but the coffee is weak. I worry that if I grind much finer that it’s going to get silty, but it hasn’t yet. But I wonder if my problem is the ratio more than the grind sizes. Anyone using a ratio with much more coffee to water?  Any opinions? ",1,1759002271.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False
1ns4djw,https://www.reddit.com/r/disneylandparis/comments/1ns4djw/review_disneyland_hotel_the_princely_suite/,(Review) Disneyland Hotel - The Princely Suite,"*tl;dr Whilst you're paying a hefty Disney premium for a large suite overlooking the park, it is worth it if you've got the money to spend and want magical views of a beautiful castle. There are some small negatives around the service, but otherwise a cosy suite for a couple and only 57 steps to the park entrance. 9/10*

# Price

I'd originally booked for 4 nights for a price of £25,135 but after a disappointing stay in the GFC suite at Sequoia Lodge earlier in the year I considered cancelling before settling on just 2 nights for £12,757. I also spent another £450 for some additional in room services as it was a special occasion for us.

# Check-In

In a stark comparison to my stay at Sequoia Lodge the check-in process was a breeze. Drove up to the hotel at around midday and had our luggage collected and car valeted, we were then escorted to the Castle Club level reception for a smooth check-in. The staff were very discreet about the extras I'd ordered and very friendly overall, it really felt like they were there to help us in any way. We were told that our suite would be ready at 3pm and would be contacted then, we returned a tad early from the park to potter around the hotel for a bit and received a WhatsApp call to let us know that the suite was ready for us. We were then escorted from the reception to the suite and shown around, our luggage followed shortly after. There were some treats awaiting us in the room, [some chocolates/sweets](https://i.imgur.com/5fRDsVu.jpeg) as well as [a small bottle of champagne and a key](https://i.imgur.com/JFB2x1V.jpeg). 

# The Suite

I'm quite a negative person and was expecting to be disappointed by the suite and services. I imagined it would be rather tacky, a standard suite you'd find at a normal hotel and not worth the price whatsoever. **How wrong I was.** There are a few videos of the suite on YouTube and TikTok, but here are a few photos of the suite. 

The door opens onto [a hallway which leads into the main lounge](https://i.imgur.com/pFK9vYg.jpeg) as well as [a small little alcove with tea/coffee making facilities](https://i.imgur.com/CMwc3zx.jpeg) as well as [a toilet](https://i.imgur.com/CLvOGsv.jpeg). The [lounge is absolutely gorgeous](https://imgur.com/a/O105D4a) and you cannot hear a sound from outside unless you open the two balcony doors. The lounge then leads into a[ lovely bedroom with a Super King bed](https://imgur.com/a/3EUoQD9) which has an en-suite bathroom that runs the length of the suite. [The bathroom](https://imgur.com/a/5HgXBou) has a separate toilet, his and hers sinks as well as exquisite shower (with multiple settings from overhead and the side) and a jacuzzi bath. Both toilets have seat warmers as well as built in bidets and fans which was a lovely little touch. The suite also has [a LED fireplace](https://i.imgur.com/YohAsiF.jpeg) with changeable colour schemes, it can also be turned off if you don't like the flicker. One minor negative was that in a bid to make the lights seem more like candles they seemed to be on ""flicker"" mode which became quite annoying and couldn't be turned off.

[The view, both during the day and at night, was worth the price alone.](https://imgur.com/a/0wa9MVr) Sadly the station blocks off much of the parade, but you can still hear it quite well (and not at all if you close the balcony doors and prefer peace and quiet) and the night time show from the balcony is not an experience we'll forget any time soon. 

# Services & Amenities

Sadly this is one of the areas where Disney does fail, the water issue I faced before returned and the mini-bar only had 2 glass bottles of water which were not refreshed. Whilst I was happy to drink the tap water, there was an odd chemical taste to it which wasn't terrific and I ended up popping into the park to buy a few bottles of water. I understand that I could have driven to a local supermarket, the shop in the train station or even the trading post in Davy Crockett but it still leaves a bad taste in the mouth to be paying this much and not be able to get bottled water.

I also ran into an issue with the laundry service. We were there over the weekend and it seems the hotel outsource their laundry service meaning it was not available to us at all during our stay. We were checking out at 11am on Monday and I was told we would not be able to make use of the laundry service on Monday as we would have been checked out by then, but I was directed to the self-service laundry available at Santa Fe. 

I was also very disappointed when my car was delivered to the hotel on Monday for check-out to discover that quite a few birds had decided to re-create a Jackson Pollock painting on my windscreen. The valet didn't seem to care at all and handed over the keys and I had to chase after him to ask for it to be cleaned. Gave the impression that once it hits 11am on checkout, the hotel is done with you. 

# Food

Breakfast was included with our booking and on the first day we opted for the buffet which was in the the Castle Club lounge. A tasty affair and the potatoes appear in our dreams until we can return again. The breakfast had the typical offerings you find elsewhere as well as a chef who would prepare eggs for you as well as fresh fruit smoothies. For our second morning we opted to have breakfast in the suite and it was quite simply magical, the table was set up right in front of the balcony doors so that we would have a view of the castle. There was also the usual snacks and drinks available at tea time in the Castle Club lounge. 

Unrelated to the suite, but the reception helpfully booked us into the Royal Banquet for one evening and it truly was an experience. The buffet itself was a chaotic mess; children screaming and running everywhere but this is more of a parent problem than a Disney problem. The Royal Banquet did seem to have an odd queuing system where you had to walk past the salads, condiments and so on if you wanted to get to the cooked food or even dessert and this seemed to cause quite a few shouting matches when guests decided to cut in line. The buffet at Davy Crockett Ranch seemed to be a much tamer experience, even if it was missing the the tasty pesto ravioli. 

# Conclusion

A short but magical stay that has made me reconsider my stance from earlier this year. I was ready to write Disney off and start exploring other parks for our breaks but this experience has drawn me back in. I've already rebooked the Princely Suite as we had such a lovely time and I'm even considering making it a yearly experience for us. I don't think I'll bother with other hotels from now on and just focus on staying at the DLH.

>Conviction, as I shall call it, is different from the previous documentaries. It doesn’t have an obvious pro-Letby agenda like the last Channel 5 doc (associate producer: Cleuci de Oliveira). Nor does it dig deeply into the scientific claims and counter-claims like the last Panorama. It is not trying to be the definitive account. **Instead it follows her lawyer Mark McDonald and expert witness Dewi Evans for an eight month period in 2024-25 when the Free Letby campaign was becoming mainstream**. Bogado was, I believe, genuinely interested in making an interesting film rather than picking sides.

>Since it was filmed in real time and started after the trials had ended, most of the action comes from the pro-Letby camp and so, in that sense, the film is unbalanced (as Bogado acknowledges). **It covers a period in which there were two press conferences organised by McDonald**. The other side gets the chance to rebut some of the claims via journalist Liz Hull, who attended the trial and co-hosts The Trial podcast, and Dewi Evans himself. Private Eye’s Phil Hammond does most of the legwork making the opposite case.

>Conviction is a film about uncertainty, starring two people who are very certain about their diametrically opposed positions, with Hammond and Hull acting as wingmen to provide the detail. This is satisfying from a dramatic perspective and there is lots of footage of Evans and McDonald in their homes, making coffee, staring out of the window and so on (perhaps a bit too much, tbh).

>There is no narration. Bogado says he wants people to make up their own minds about what they are seeing. He said on Monday night that some scenes are like a Rorschach test in that people from both sides interpret them as confirmation of what they believe. I suspect that one example of this is the scene where Dewi Evans is filmed watching the Shoo Lee press conference for the first time. John Sweeney is (wrongly and irrelevantly) claiming that Evans has never published a peer-reviewed study and Shoo Lee is posing three questions to Evans directly. Sat in front of the TV, a weary Evans is silently taking notes and quietly sighing. Depending on your perspective on Letby’s guilt, his body language is either that of a man who has been exposed or that of a man who can scarcely believe that people can be so ignorant.

The piece continues with opinion, such as:

>If I had to guess what impression a general audience would have of the two protagonists after seeing this film, it would be that Evans is stubborn and has a chip on his shoulder while Mark McDonald is a media tart who loves the limelight. There is an element of truth to this. In the film, Evans expresses the peculiar opinion that resistance to the verdict has been driven by the “metropolitan elite” in the south of England while McDonald’s insistence that “it’s not about me!” seems like a case of protesting too much.

I would not be surprised if people would get that impression from these men.

Some subreddit members will be in agreement with Snowdon when he writes:

>I can understand why the makers of Conviction don’t want to get bogged down in details like this, **but it would be better not to mention the science at all than to only give us half the picture.** Dewi Evans says (in the film) that he has written reports responding to all the claims made by the Shoo Lee panel, but we don’t hear him talking about any of them (the producers visited his home three times so Evans must have discussed the medical claims of the Lee panel in more detail than we see in the film). Instead, we get footage of him basically just saying that Lee’s experts are wrong.

In fact, the review is so fairly written that I'm pretty annoyed by how he ended it:

>Overall, this is a fine film and well worth watching. But it is probably best enjoyed in the privacy of your own home rather than in a cinema surrounded by cackling victims of Dunning-Kruger syndrome.",3,1759002178.0,lucyletby,0,1.0,False

This is a request for tips and tricks so I hope my flair is okay!!

I take my 30mg of vyvanse in the morning around 08:30. It helps me throughout the entirety of the morning, and then once lunch hits, I feel them starting to wear off a bit. Lunch is from 12:40 - 13:30. I usually then grab a coffee drink of some kind and I’m good until the end of my day, which is 15:35. 

Issue is, once that’s all done, I’m also done. So done. I can barely function at home, and I know some of it is from exhaustion from the day (I just started back in a school setting after over a decade since I was in school at all).

But being a, y’know, adult (ugh), I have to still get stuff done in the evenings. What are some things that you all have utilized in order to keep that motivation going?

Additional question for those that can answer: my friend uses CBD to help with his ADHD. He is unmedicated. Has anyone used CBD for this, and does it help? (I am in Canada and cannabis is legal here so I do hope my question is acceptable)

Thank you all in advance!

TLDR: I need something after my meds wear off past 16:00 in the evenings to help keep me motivated so I can get chores done. Any recommendations? ",1,1759002074.0,VyvanseADHD,2,1.0,False

1ns486o,https://i.redd.it/x71bt4flfrrf1.png,A Canadian in All 50 States: A Reflective Odyssey,"Last week in Oahu, I rented a moped — not a WRX, not a Mustang — because that fit better with the island vibe. And with that ride along the Pacific, I closed the circle: I’ve now driven in **all 50 U.S. states**. Back story [HERE](https://www.planksip.org/a-canadian-in-all-50-states-a-reflective-odyssey)

But don’t mistake this for a polished bucket-list achievement. This wasn’t corporate, it wasn’t curated. It started when I was 21, a broke Canadian with a beat-up 1978 Toyota Corolla 5-speed and a bad habit of climbing fences.

# Dollywood at 2 a.m.

In Tennessee, my buddy and I scaled the fence at Dollywood in the dead of night. Security lights blazed, alarms went off, and we dove into one of those ball pits — yes, the plastic ones meant for kids. We lay there, holding our breath, buried in a sea of red, yellow, and blue, waiting half an hour for the guards to give up. That’s one way to see America.

# Atlantic City at Dawn

Another time, we ended up on the helicopter pad of Trump’s Atlantic City casino. I’ll never forget the little booth up there — steaming cup of coffee, half-eaten donut — a guard was just around the corner. We bolted across the pad with the ocean wind in our hair, laughing like idiots, sure we’d get caught. But we didn’t.

# 24,000 Miles in a Corolla

We washed windows at gas stations to scrape together cash. We slept in the Corolla at rest areas, steering wheel for a pillow, shivering through nights in states we couldn’t afford motels in. Over 24,000 miles in two and a half months, we zig-zagged across the lower 48. Some stretches blurred together in exhaustion, others burned into memory forever.

Texas felt like an entire country. Maine was all salt air and stoic towns. California highways — beautiful chaos. And yet the road itself was the constant, the hum of tires on asphalt the soundtrack to our lives.

# Hawaii: The Final Boss

So when I rolled out on that little Oahu moped last week, it wasn’t about luxury or status. It was about completion. Hawaii was the last piece, the “final boss.” And fittingly, it wasn’t conquered in some muscle car fantasy but in flip-flops, buzzing along the coast, laughing at how far the road had carried me from that Corolla at 21.

# Why It Mattered

Driving all 50 states wasn’t about seeing them. It was about **surviving them**. About getting chased, getting lost, and getting found. About turning America into a mirror — one that reflected back a kid who wanted stories more than comfort.

And I got them. Every damn mile.

Before that I was always in relationships. I somewhat thought that dating might not be for me as I met around 14 people and I was not attracted to most of them. I did like 2 people but they were not offering the time and attention I wanted so I decided to move on without begging them for attention. Not to sound arrogant or anything but I do think that I am a catch as I have never failed to pull someone I wanted as well as not wanted. All the 13 dates, they were into me. I have strict rules towards dating which include not being physical and not inviting them home. I have known this one guy for over an year now. We met online but we lived in different cities so we never got to meet before a year period. We talked on and off nothing consistent however once we talked on a call and he told me he came out of relationship few months back and he was heartbroken and devastated. I did think at that time that I don’t want to be someone’s rebound although I did think I will keep a check on him, which I didn’t as I got busy and forgot about it. So after a year period, he hits me on my social media saying he will be crossing my city and if I’m up for a dinner. I said yes. He was earlier than he was expected to be free and I was not ready when he was nearby so I asked him to come at my place as it was not dinner time anyways. He came, we talked and had a coffee and I asked if it is a date or not and he got confused which was cute. He said let’s say I was crossing so we thought we should meet. I asked about her ex as he was not in a very good condition when we talked but it was around a year ago. He said it’s over, they did talk four months back but it’s over. I asked to see her picture, he showed me one and I felt he is still sad about it. I did not think much about it at that time as it was not the date YET. We went out for dinner, he was nice, considerate and gentleman. He looked for a dessert place himself and took me there. He paid even when I offered because it was not a date. At dessert place, we talked about our family traumas and bonded over that. We both felt something there. He came back to drop me and I was confused if I should invite him over or just say bye. So I did neither and got off the car. He came after me and eventually at my place again. At that time we both were feeling it. I hinted very strongly that I will be okay with being intimate. We ended up making out and he confessed that he has been checking my social media for quite a time now but he was embarrassed to admit it and he was checking me out in the restaurant as well. Anyways, we cuddled and made out for a while but I made it clear that I will not be having a night stand. He agreed and around 11, he said he should leave otherwise it will be hard for him to control. We kissed each other goodbye and he left. He texted me when he reached. Texted me next morning as well. But by the night he started to disappear. I texted him myself and he just told me he has been busy with his business and stuff. Then he completely disappeared. After some time I asked what happened and he said that “would it be fair if I can’t do justice to you” and “I have been open to you” I said okay, let’s not start something we can’t end. Few months passed, he was still in my mind but I didn’t do anything stupid, however he saw my social media post when I was in his city and he asked to meet again. I said we can meet next week, he said okay but then when I asked him to schedule meet-up he was very unresponsive. Eventually, he texted next day saying he was very busy and asked if we can meet now. I told him where I was, he picked me up and we went for a coffee. I was pissed at his at that time and I complained about his irresponsive behaviour and he told me he has his notifications off due to business and he kept telling me he is very busy most of the times. When he dropped me off, I told him that we should not be even in contact and he said no, I don’t leave people behind. That meetup was full of confusion. Then when I came back, I started to call him as he said, if I wanna talk I should call and not text. He was mostly responsive on calls and even he facetimed me once. But he didn’t initiate anything still and then I started to back off again. Then after a month I was again in his city and I asked him to meet next day. He responded late with directly where shall we meet. We went for a coffee again and he felt so distracted like he was looking here and there and I was confused. The confusion is, he often hints to be interested like once he said I would care about my partner and I said yeah I understand you don’t care about me and he quickly said “ I didn’t say that” or he would ask if I found someone. And I know he tries to pretend that he doesn’t notice me as he admitted that to me in our close moments. He also said that he will come to my place but his work got him so he couldn’t. After our last meeting I decided I will not run after him and I even said that you will not hear from me again. But it’s been 3 months and I’m still obsessed with him. He likes my particular stories, most posts. He did wish me on my birthday. But he doesn’t do anything to initiate something. Even in our last 2 meetings, he didn’t try to hold me.

Just posting my timeline and story to give back to this community. And, to give positivity, especially to the ones who are waiting for their turn at Newark, New Jersey Field Office (there are quite a number of negative remarks from this FO.) 

I, the beneficiary, came to USA with an ESTA/visa waiver program just last January 2025. Got married to a naturalized US citizen on March 2025. I overstayed my entry.

We got an immigration lawyer to help us file everything as we have no clue what to do given our circumstances. (Known my husband, the USC petitioner, since we were kids. Been officially dating just last year June and just on a long distance relationship. Facetime calls everyday and husband visited me in my country only twice)

We submitted both i-130 and i-485 together with my sealed medical paperwork. 

⭐️Here are all the documents we submitted:

	•	Both our birth certificates
	•	Marriage License

❗️(Made sure both our names are reflected on these documents below)
	•	Joint bank statements
	•	Rental agreements
	•	2 months of Electricity bills
	•	2 months of Phone bills
	•	Life insurance beneficiary statement
	•	My retirement beneficiary statement from my country of origin
	•	Affidavits of support of relationship from my mother, his mother, his sister and one of our common friend along with their IDs.

Our lawyer said the more proof the better. So, we just gave every little thing to USCIS. 

Got my biometrics appointment just after a month of them receiving our packet and received my EAD card one week after.

Interview was scheduled for yesterday, Friday September 26, 2025 at 10:45am.

Me and my husband dressed in like we are going  to work at an office, business casual. Our lawyer advised us no need to bring her to the interview, as when we were prepping with her, she was confident with us. 

Arrived at Newark FO on the 14th floor 45minutes early and checked in on the window. We gave our notice of interview letter to the receptionist. The  waiting room was packed with other couples and some children, lawyers and interpreters. We got to people watch for a time. Some of them got separated.. others were shedding a tear of dismay once they got out of the interview double doors. It added to our anxiety seeing those sad faces. Some were happy, smiling and giving loving gestures after their interview which gave us positive vibes, too. Basically, it was a mixed emotions of waiting since we got called in just before 12noon. 🫠

Surprisingly, officer didn't call us to check our IDs at the reception window like what other couples did. He called in my name and he just said to follow him thru the interview hallway.

We gathered our binders and two huge photo albums. 

Officer was a lovely man...he clearly had a nice cup of coffee as he was so calm, professional and respectful. He introduced himself and that he would like to see both our passports and state IDs/drivers license. 

He then asked our additional bona fide paperwork so he can scan them. He even said thank you to us because we organised them by dates with sticky notes on top and highlighted our names and addresses on each paper. 

We brought a lot and he said he just needed the ones after we got married. I gave him the following: 

	•	Rent receipts
	•	Car insurance
	•	Updated bank statements
	•	Credit card statements
	•	Electricity bills
	•	Pet insurance
	•	Receipts from the wedding

He didnt bother with all the receipts from airbnb, hotel bookings, or the movie tickets we printed out. Or the engagement ring receipt we forgot to include in the packet. 

He just acknowledged our huge photo albums and didn't even bother to see them. 

He then proceeded to take our oaths and he looked at my husband and said he is conducting the i-130 interview first.

He just asked for his full name, his date of birth and his residential address. My full name date of birth and where I was born. He just asked him how many times he was married (just once, me) and how many times has he petitioned an alien relative (just once, me). He just asked if he knew my phone number, which he did have memorised by heart. It was done. Husband signed that interview was conducted.

Officer then looked at me and said he will do the i-485 interview. He just asked my full name, date of birth, residential address, my husband's full name, date of birth, when and where we got married, what kind of ceremony we had. If we are planning to have a religious ceremony at some point (i answered ""we haven't planned on that yet"" he apologised like he offended me 😅 i just said ""no,no it's fine. We might do a church one at some point"") He asked if I was married before. He also, asked me the dates of my entry to the USA. 

That's it! He then proceeded to ask me the yes/no questions on the form i-485. I said NO to everything except the ""Have you EVER violated the terms or conditions of your nonimmigrant status?"" Which I said YES to coz I did overstay and he said it's fine coz I'm married to a citizen anyway. That was it. He made me sign that he had conducted the interview and gave us the NOTICE OF INTERVIEW RESULTS paper.

He said we have no red flags and not to worry about anything. And he then advised me my green card will be 2years conditional and that I can apply for citizenship once I hit 3 years of green card status.

I was confused at that point. And asked if we were approved. He said yes, no red flags and they will review our case and not to worry about anything.

Still, confused coz of the review bit that he said but he was all smiles and led us through the exit door and wished us luck on our future family. 

Because of that..me and my husband were all high with happiness. We were so giddy and just giggling like kids on the hallway until the parking lot... that I forgot to ask for when can we expect the results of that ""review."" Husband just said let's just wait and see and have something nice for lunch.. our stomachs were singing hungry songs by that point. 😂

Here I am now writing my journey... hoping this will help someone in this community... today Saturday, September 26, 2025, received a taken an action email from USCIS two hours ago, my i-485 said APPROVED 🎉🎉🎉

My i-130 is still saying interview was scheduled tho, even on my husband's account. I guess we have to wait and see. But..

I am beyond thankful to this community! 🥰 Sending positive vibes and manifesting good news to everyone soon! 🤞🏼🙏🏼☺️

Thanks to everyone that is sharing news updates and experiences in this community.

I am lucky to have the best lawyer from my home country, a lawyer that is defending the president, the prime minister and some other important people from my country in Europe.

But, having a lawyer even a great and expensive lawyer doesn’t mean literally anything to you and your case unless you get your shit together and know what you are doing with paperwork, answers during the interview etc.

My interview was in late August in Florida and i went 45 minutes earlier with my wife and lawyer. We waited for 2 hours to be called and a serious officer opened the door and called our number. 
During this time of 2 hours this officer never opened the door or called someone else so when we entered his office he had many things written on a piece of paper and started the interview with raising the right hand and as usual, to promise that you will say the truth.

He started saying that he is hungry and that he loves eating pizza and asked me if I like deep dish pizza 🍕 which I have tried and yes I like it. 
My first advise to everyone is to bring literally everything that you have from paperwork literally every piece of paper no matter if its on the letter or not.
He started asking how we met and was looking at my wife who was the petitioner. He was looking at the piece of paper infront of him and said I know everything about your case. 

After this short question he asked these questions:

1) when was your second date?
2) do you have any kids? ( she has 3 kids from her previous relationships not married before ) 
3) have you ever got into a fight?

Started asking me: 
1) when did you land in the US
2) why did you land on 9/11 and why in NY?
3) how many times have you been in NY
We havent traveled together yet and asked me if we are planning to go somewhere and I had printed our tickets to NY for next month and asked me again about NY which doesnt make any sense… its just I have been in NY many times cuz I love the city and have money to be doing it.. 

He was positive and his system was very slow also his printer and scanner were not working so he has to go to another office to print, when he was coming back my wife was yawning 🥱 and he said i promise we will do this fast we are almost done so thats when I said wow thats awesome! 🤩 
The officer looked me in my eyes and said to me hey I will go with the next phase which is asking some other questions and we should be done

Started asking me about my life in FL why i decided to live here and do I have anyone from my family, and I do, I have my sister here in Florida that lives next to us.
Asked if we have more paperwork and thats what I was waiting for,
I gave him new joint bank statements and he said I already have them ( im not sure how )
I gave him FPL bills he said I have them already..lol
Then he really liked our car title on both names and asked who is driving it and when and if we have another 🚗 
My wife yawned again which i hated and the officer saw her again and said I will be quick and we will be done shortly he promises 😂

He then started talking to my lawyer here since he has an office in FL, IL and NY and asked for how long he works for this company and my lawyer is the owner and then he started to respect alot and started sharing his experiences with someone that literally had offices in the same states and how he became one of his best friends..

They started laughing at something which i forgot about and then my lawyer said if I can provide the rest of the paperwork I have that is fresh and not updates in their portal
He stopped at the pictures, took all of them and started asking 1 by 1 like a short description of them and stopped at a picture where I was with my wife and one of the kids, and all of a sudden he asked - so this is the small one? And Im not sure how and why I said - Yes this is the fast one, and everyone started laughing and he liked it a lot. 

Then we went through the I-485 quesitons and started asking me again about NY which I really dont know why….
All of a dudden said that we should follow him to the main printer, when we went there there were 3 other officers around with mugs of coffee on a break and I was like what the hell is going on 😂 
Our officer was printing the final paper and the other officers started blaming ours that he broke this printer too😊😅 and the atmosphere was great and they were all happy and laughing 😂 

after 30 days of the interview I got my i-130 approved and Im still waiting for the i-485 

* quick tip, trust your proccess, bring your smile over there and be natural and normal as you are. They are all normal human beings that are doing their job - DONT FORGET to have everything well organized and to be respectful have a confident body language and look him directly.

You know who you are. You're sweaty and you're over it. Holding a thought in your head? Pffft. Where did this anger come from and why do I want to cry? 

Because hormones are bastards. 

This isn't specifically. We do not care Club, but particular movement is definitely an inspiration. Inspiration. We don't have to be isolated in all of this bullshit. We're dealing with. All the weird stuff going on with our bodies that we don't understand. 

It looks like there's a lot of people who are interested in meeting at least somewhat regularly, so if you aren't available this time, we'll do it again. I included a Discord link. There's room to chat, plan, or whatever. I'll post dates in the sub when we know what's going on. 

I know a lot of people are not too keen on Discord, but it is the best place to disseminate information, chat, that sort of thing. There are good tutorials and I'm working out how to make the display a little bit more streamlined and accessible. 

I thought coffee might be the easiest way to go. I don't want anyone to feel like we're going to sit down in a restaurant and everybody has to buy something. My thought is Black Rock coffee. It's down on 7th, and there is some parking. Alternately, I thought about dark pine downtown. It seems like they have a lot of space that isn't always getting used. The parking situation would be much easier too. There's a poll at the bottom here.

Blake seems strong enough to stand against those like Katakuri or at least Queen. The rest of the Stages seem to be there mainly so that Blake doesn't backstab Ragnar and take his stuff. November could stop the oxygen. Clementine, if she's Depression, could put him out with her coffee logia.

And Acceptance seems built up to just generally be powerful enough to quash him if he acts up. But Denial seems to not be part of that apparatus.

1ns3xkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ns3xkl/what_does_this_mean/,What does this mean.,"Over the course of my teenage years, I have struggled with depression. Now at 18, despite making improvements in my life, I still find myself experiencing periods of suicidal thoughts.

I’ve tried to build meaning into my daily life, reminding myself that we only get one life and I don’t want to end up with regrets. I’ve established a consistent routine: going to the gym regularly, learning things that interest me, and keeping a healthy sleep schedule.

However, I still have no close friends. I sometimes wonder if the ongoing loneliness contributes to my suicidal thoughts, or if there is something deeper I don’t fully understand, perhaps unresolved experiences from my past.

Growing up, I had few friends and the ones I did have eventually drifted away. I also felt emotionally neglected by my father. There were moments of intense conflict: once, he did not intervene when I tried to cut my wrist with a knife to prove to him that I wasn't acting which he kept saying I did do (I got stopped forcefully by family), another time, I smashed a glass table with my forehead during an argument, bleeding heavily. There was frequent yelling, and one incident where he harmed me after finding me stirring a cup of coffee at night.

These events are no longer happening, and I’ve tried to let go of my anger toward him because I don't think he's a bad person.

Yet the suicidal thoughts persist, With me wanting to act on them and not understanding why I should even bother getting up the next day.

 I take medication for depression, but lately I feel it may no longer be working, which worries me. And I don't consult psychiatrists after my previous ones treated my emotions like nothing.

I’m not sure whether it’s the loneliness, unresolved pain from my past, or maybe an idea on life that I haven't understood yet, but I’m still struggling, nothing has changed.",2,1759001123.0,depression,0,1.0,False

When I got it, the inside was pretty gnarly so I used the Impressa Descaler multiple times to try and improve it. The inside looks a lot better but certainly not perfect or brand new. Additionally no matter how many times I run it a few flakes of grossness still seem to come out. I imagine it wont make it into my coffee once I have the espresso grounds and filter in it though I think. 

I’ve included some progress photos of the inside so you can have any idea of what we’re working with this. The first photo is after I ran it with water the first time, the second shows after I did two cycles of the descaler, and the third is after two more cycles of the descaler. 

But I’m a bit of a worrier and I just want to know if people think I can use it. If anyone has any advice I’d greatly appreciate it, but I’m all out of descaler and sick of cycling the thing. ",0,1759001110.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

I had been wanting to order the SSP MP v1 (brew) burrs but was having trouble finding them in stock anywhere online. I was also finding limited info on forums/reddit for where to buy the more niche SSP burrs. I found a thread where someone mentioned that the official SSP website is espressotool.com, but there was not much info on how reliable the site was or how quickly the burrs shipped. 

To add to this, the espressotool.com website is kind of hard to navigate and order from. It’s also basically non-functional on mobile. I really wanted to try the burrs out, so I decided to give it a shot and placed an order. I was worried that I may have been scammed out of my money after not getting any shipping info for multiple days after ordering. However to my surprise, the burrs that I ordered showed up to my door from South Korea (I live in southeast USA) just 6 days after ordering. So overall, I would 100% recommend ordering from that website if you are looking for a more niche burr that isn’t available on other more typical coffee websites. The website is legit.

Two years ago, I had a nightmare that I believe God was speaking to me. I got up out of bed and heard a booming voice that was incomprehensible. I was in a panic and tried to leave my apartment. But I tripped on my coffee table, and heard clearly “and now it’s all over.” My last sight was the sun peering through my living room windows, and I felt a full body hot flash, and was in my bed. It shook me to my core, but didn’t really get to process it, as I woke up at 4AM, and needed to work at 7, so I went right back to bed and had dreamless sleep. 

In this period of my life, I was an “impotent Christian.” I never not identified as not a Christian, but never went to church, and just focused on earthly pleasures. I had a job that was very demanding (AGM of a hotel, so sometimes I had to work 16 hours a day without breaks) At some point after the nightmare, I was home and drunkenly broke down crying, and knew I needed to start going to church again. Along with that, put effort into finding a new career. 

Fast forward two years later, I found a new job I enjoy, and have been going to a PCUSA church. I have also attended, out of curiosity a Catholic and Lutheran church. I have mixed practices myself. I possess a rosary, and while I do not pray it correctly like a cradle Catholic would, I like holding it. 

Despite working to improve myself, I still fall into lustful and wrathful patterns. (In my heart mostly, I am rather a calm person towards others) 

Two weeks ago, before going to bed, I said 11 Hail Marys, a Lord’s Prayer, and a personal one. In my personal prayer, I repented over my sins, and acknowledged the inadequacy that I will never truly overcome my sinful behavior, I have faith in Christ. 

After I went to bed, I felt God’s presence again. I had a dreamless black sleep, however before waking up, I felt the warmth of the sun on my face for minutes before waking up. Since then, I still feel lust and wrath at times. But if a light being on or off represented sinful behavior, since that night it’s like a dimmer switch in my mind and heart had lowered the brightness. 

I know that I alone cannot stop this. But I feel “over it.” Pestering thoughts of anger and grudges towards others don’t hold much of my thoughts anymore. And I’ve been porn and masturbating free since then. I still look at women in fleeting desire, but I truly want a constructive relationship with a woman now. 

I just wanted to put to words how I’ve felt these last two weeks. God bless you all, and I pray that everyone can be improved through Christ.",2,1759000619.0,TrueChristian,1,1.0,False

So basics out of the way (let me know if I missed anything), I'd like to be able to continue to work through the storm if the power goes out -- again, this is a townhouse, so limited what I can do.. and at worst, I'm expecting 1, maybe 2 days at worst of power out -- I need to be able to use a laptop, have internet access -- I have a desktop, but I'll power that down and use my laptop (surface, very power efficient):

\* 3x 2000Va/1600 watt lLiFePo4 battery backups for laptops and modem/router

\* Battery operated hotspot in case internet goes down

\* flashlights/batteries

\* Makita battery operated coffee maker

\* cars all gassed up

1ns3jkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Tetraom/comments/1ns3jkn/reallife_examples_how_i_use_tetraoms_daily/,🌞 Real-Life Examples: How I Use TETRAOM’s Daily Guidance,"What I love about TETRAOM is that it doesn’t just give you “cosmic info” — it highlights **Opportunities & Challenges**you can act on in the moment. Here are three times where those simple insights shifted my whole day:

# 🌞 Example 1: Work / Meetings

**Header: How I Use TETRAOM Before a Big Work Meeting**  
I woke up knowing I had a high-stakes meeting later that morning. Before even making coffee, I opened TETRAOM and saw:

* **Opportunity → Clear communication**
* **Challenge → Emotional reactivity**

That was spot on, because I tend to get passionate and sometimes interrupt when I care too much about an idea. Instead of just winging it, I wrote out bullet points so I wouldn’t lose focus. I also reminded myself to take a breath before answering tough questions.

👉 Result: During the meeting, I stayed calm, made my points clearly, and people were actually nodding along instead of pushing back. Walking out, I felt like I had led with clarity instead of stress.

# 💕 Example 2: Relationships

**Header: Checking TETRAOM Before a Tough Conversation with My Partner**  
That same week, I had to bring up a touchy subject with my partner. TETRAOM’s forecast said:

* **Opportunity → Deep listening**
* **Challenge → Misunderstandings / projecting fears**

That was the nudge I needed. Normally, I’d come in defensive, ready to prove my point. Instead, I slowed down, asked open questions, and really listened.

👉 Result: What could have turned into an argument became one of the most open and calm conversations we’d had in weeks. Instead of walking away frustrated, we felt closer — and I realized how much difference it makes to adjust my approach with a little awareness.

# 🧘 Example 3: Personal Growth / Focus

**Header: How TETRAOM Helped Me Avoid Burnout in My Morning Routine**  
One morning I had a packed to-do list, but TETRAOM showed:

* **Opportunity → Grounding & creativity**
* **Challenge → Overcommitment / spreading energy too thin**

That hit home, because I usually say yes to everything and end up exhausted. So I made a choice: cut the list in half and focus on one creative project that mattered most.

👉 Result: By the end of the day, instead of dragging myself to bed feeling burnt out, I was energized, proud of my progress, and even had extra time to relax. It reminded me that doing less — with focus — often brings more satisfaction.

✨ These are the kinds of small shifts that TETRAOM makes possible. It’s not just “cosmic weather,” it’s a **daily compass** that helps you bring more clarity, calm, and balance into real life.

Stats: UW GPA: 95.8 W GPA 98.6. I arrived at my school sophomore year where they limited us to 1 AP which was AP world and I got a 5. They then let me be the first student to exceed the limits of 3 APs for junior and senior years where last year I took calc ab (4), chem (4), APUSH (5), and AP Lang (5). This year I am taking AP Spanish, AP stats, AP Lit, and AP Gov/AP Microeconomics. I have a 1510 SAT (740 R/W and 770 M) and I am taking a school day SAT October 7 so I am hoping to raise that.

ECs: I have been involved in student gov each year at my school and served as president last year. This year it was disbanded by admin, so I serve in pretty much the same role with a different title. I interned for a superior court judge in my state this summer. I serve as an immigration law assistant. I have done mock trial each year at my school and will be captain this year. I have also been in my school’s investment club each year and am co president this year. Varsity bball 4 years and captain 2 years. I have done Jiujitsu for 2 years and have 2 years of varsity soccer. I am also a part of my school’s leadership group selected by our admin and through that I serve as a school tour guide and ambassador. Lastly, I served on our honor council.

Awards: I was a semifinalist in my state’s governor’s honors program for social studies twice and was also nominated for communicative arts. Social studies departmental award (10), Spanish departmental award (11), dean’s list every semester, AP scholar with Distinction

Essays/LORs: I feel very good about my uncommon essay where I use the past prompt on two types of people in the world to talk about my sister and I’s different coffee orders that we get when she is in town and I relate that to how different but close we are and how that has inspired me to branch out and try new things at school and in life. My letters of rec might be the highlight of my application. I have had multiple teachers at my school request that they write mine and my counselor said she wrote a very strong one for me. I also have one from the judge I worked for. I want to study history/spanish and eventually become an immigration attorney, and I feel like that will be pointed out by my letters and essays. In my why UChicago essay I talked about the core curriculum appealing to my interest in multiple subjects and talked about how my tour guide did all of the activities I’m interested in and how that helped me see a prosperous future at UChicago. In my main common app essay, I split it into three nicknames I have gone by and talk about what they mean to me with emphasis on how my school janitor calls me “mijo lindo” (my beautiful son) everyday because we speak in Spanish together and how that has inspired me to study Spanish further and become an immigration attorney.

If you read all of this, thank you so much!! Does anyone have any opinions on things I could improve upon or focus on in the short period of time before the application is due? Any tips are appreciated!

1ns3czj,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1ns3czj/the_secret_to_building_healthy_habits/,The Secret to Building Healthy Habits,"The journey to a healthier, more vibrant life is not paved with grand, sweeping gestures, but with the small, consistent steps we take each day. These steps are our habits—the invisible architecture of our daily existence. While the desire for change is often strong, the path to making new habits stick can feel elusive. The secret, however, lies not in a surge of willpower, but in a gentle, strategic approach that works with human nature, not against it.

https://preview.redd.it/9fngeykcalrf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0db1cd48743e1045376dace95c4938a87fb058bc



The most powerful principle for building lasting habits is to start astonishingly small. The ambition to meditate for thirty minutes, exercise for an hour, or read fifty pages a night is admirable, but such goals can be intimidating to the part of us that craves comfort. The key is to make the new behavior so easy that it requires almost no motivation to begin. The goal is not to achieve a monumental outcome on day one, but to simply establish the identity of someone who does this action. Floss one tooth. Do one push-up. Read one paragraph. This minimal commitment bypasses the brain's resistance, and the act of consistently showing up, even in a tiny way, builds the neural pathways of the new habit far more effectively than sporadic bursts of effort.



Consistency trumps intensity every time. It is the daily repetition, not the duration or intensity, that forges a habit into an automatic part of your life. The rhythm of doing a behavior at the same time and in the same context creates a powerful trigger. This is the principle of habit stacking—anchoring a new habit to an existing one. After you pour your morning coffee, you take one minute to breathe deeply. After you brush your teeth at night, you write one sentence in a journal. By linking the new desire to an established routine, you leverage the momentum of your current habits, making the new action feel natural and effortless.



Another essential element is to focus on the feeling, not just the finish line. Healthy habits are sustainable when they are intrinsically rewarding. Instead of focusing solely on a distant goal like weight loss or increased productivity, bring your attention to the immediate positive sensation the habit provides. Notice the feeling of clarity after a moment of mindfulness. Appreciate the sense of accomplishment after completing your tiny habit. Savor the energy boost from a short walk. When the habit itself becomes the reward, you are no longer relying on willpower to push yourself; you are pulled forward by the positive experience.



It is also crucial to design an environment that supports your goals, rather than one that challenges them. Willpower is a finite resource, but a well-designed environment works for you automatically. Place the book you want to read on your pillow. Keep a water bottle on your desk. Prepare healthy snacks and make them easily accessible. By reducing the friction associated with your desired habit and increasing the friction for habits you wish to avoid, you set yourself up for success without constant internal negotiation.



Finally, practice self-compassion, not self-criticism. There will be days when the habit is missed. The path to change is never a straight line. The critical voice that says, ""You failed,"" is the single greatest threat to lasting change. Instead, meet a missed day with kindness. Acknowledge it without judgment and simply recommit to the small step the next day. This resilient mindset ensures that a temporary stumble does not become a permanent derailment.



Building healthy habits is the art of gentle persistence. It is the quiet power of showing up for yourself in small ways, day after day. By starting small, prioritizing consistency, finding the joy in the action, and crafting a supportive environment, you are not just building habits—you are building a new you, one peaceful, positive step at a time.",1,1758999722.0,mypersonaldevelopment,0,1.0,False

We'd meet up twice a week after class, sometimes grab coffee. My husband worked late constantly, and I was lonely. Not an excuse, just context.

He found out three weeks ago. Went through my phone while I was sleeping. Woke up to him sitting on the edge of the bed, holding my phone, tears streaming down his face.

""How long?"" he asked.

""Six months,"" I said.

""Get out.""

""Can we talk about this?""

""Get. Out.""

I tried explaining it meant nothing. That it was just sex, just loneliness, just a mistake. He wouldn't listen. Started packing my stuff into garbage bags while I sat there begging him to calm down.

""You're being dramatic,"" I told him. ""It literally meant nothing. Can't we work through this?""

He stopped packing and looked at me. ""Nothing? Six months of lying to my face meant nothing?""

""That's not what I meant.""

""What did you mean then?""

I couldn't answer. He finished packing my things and put them on the porch. I stayed at my sister's place that night.

The next two weeks were hell. He wouldn't answer my calls or texts. Changed the locks. Only communicated through his lawyer. I'd go to pick up the kids and he'd have them ready at the door, wouldn't even look at me. When I brought them back, same thing. Door would open, kids would go in, door would close. No words.

But when the kids were around? Different story. Suddenly he'd talk to me like nothing happened. ""Hey, don't forget their dentist appointment Tuesday."" Or ""Their school play is next Friday at seven."" Normal parent stuff, normal voice, but only when the kids could hear.

The second they were out of earshot? Stone cold silence.

""This is manipulation,"" I told him one day when I dropped them off. The kids had just run inside. ""You're using them as weapons against me.""

He finally looked at me. Really looked at me. ""No. I'm protecting them from whatever this is. They don't need to see their parents at war.""

""But ignoring me when they're gone? That's mature?""

""More mature than pretending six months of betrayal meant nothing.""

My mom got diagnosed with cancer around this time. Stage four. Doctors gave her weeks. I texted him about it, hoping maybe this would make him realize life's too short for this anger. He replied, ""I'm sorry about your mom. The kids can visit her whenever you want.""

That's it. No comfort. No support. Just logistics about the kids.

Mom died two weeks later. The funeral was yesterday. Small service, maybe fifty people. I gave the eulogy, talked about how mom taught us that family comes first, that loyalty matters, that love means standing by each other through everything.

I was walking back to my seat when I saw him. Back row, black suit. My sister grabbed my arm. ""Did you invite him?""

""No.""

After the service, people were giving condolences in the church lobby. I was hugging my aunt when someone tapped my shoulder. My husband. Holding an envelope.

""I'm sorry about your mom,"" he said quietly. Then louder, so others could hear, ""These are for you.""

Divorce papers. At my mother's funeral. In front of my entire family.

My cousin gasped. My aunt's mouth fell open. My sister looked ready to kill him.

""Are you serious right now?"" I hissed.

""You talked about loyalty,"" he said. ""About family coming first. Standing by each other. Every word was a knife, considering what you did. So yeah, I'm serious.""

He left before I could respond. Just walked out while everyone stared at me holding those papers next to my mother's memorial photo.

My phone's been blowing up since yesterday. Half my family thinks he's a monster for the timing. The other half says I got what I deserved. My sister says I should use this against him in court, show how vengeful he is. My dad won't even talk to me because ""the man had a point about loyalty.""

But here's what gets me. Last night, my daughter called from his house. She was crying because she missed grandma. And you know what I heard in the background? Him comforting her. Telling her grandma loved her so much, that grief is just love with nowhere to go, that it's okay to cry.

The same man who humiliated me hours earlier was being the perfect father. The same man who won't speak to me unless the kids are around was teaching our daughter about processing loss.

So I need to know. After everything, after I cheated, after I minimized it, after I accused him of weaponizing the kids, after he served me papers at my mom's funeral... am I the asshole for thinking he took this revenge thing too far? Or did I create this monster myself?

Because right now, I can't tell if I'm the victim or the villain anymore.

1ns3aqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1ns3aqw/november_9_colleen_hoover/,November 9 – Colleen Hoover,"Hey everyone! I just finished reading Colleen Hoover's *November 9*, and I'm super keen to share my thoughts with you all, just like I would with a friend over coffee. If you've been curious about this one or are looking for your next read, I've got some honest insights. You can even check out more about it here: [November 9 – Colleen Hoover](https://pdfhive.com/november-9-colleen-hoover/).

So, what's *November 9* all about without giving anything away? It tells the story of Fallon and Ben, who meet by chance on November 9th, Fallon's last day in Los Angeles before moving across the country. They feel an instant, undeniable connection. Instead of pursuing a traditional relationship, they decide to meet once a year, on that same date, to see where life has taken them and if their feelings still hold true. It’s a really unique premise for a love story, focusing on how people change and grow—or don't—when they're apart, only to reconnect one day out of 365.

### What I Truly Enjoyed

First off, the characters, Fallon and Ben, are just wonderful. Colleen Hoover has a real knack for creating people who feel incredibly real and flawed, making it easy to root for them, even when they're making questionable decisions. Their chemistry is palpable from the get-go, and seeing how they evolve each year through their brief encounters is fascinating. Ben, in particular, is a writer, and his perspective gives the story a lovely, introspective layer.

The writing style, as is typical with CoHo, is incredibly engaging and easy to fall into. It's direct, heartfelt, and moves at a pace that keeps you turning pages. Even though you're only getting snippets of their lives once a year, she manages to build a really strong emotional connection between the reader and the characters. For those new to contemporary romance or character-driven stories, this book is a fantastic way to dip your toes in. It's not overly complicated, but it dives deep into human emotions.

The ""one day a year"" structure is brilliant. It creates so much anticipation. Each chapter is a new November 9th, and you're always wondering what's happened in the intervening year, how they've changed, and if they'll still find their way back to each other. It's a fresh take that really sets it apart.

### What Gave Me Pause (or Might Not Be For Everyone)

While I genuinely enjoyed the book, it wouldn't be an honest review without mentioning a couple of things. There are some plot developments and twists that felt a bit… dramatic. While they certainly add emotional impact, some readers might find certain revelations a little less believable or perhaps a tad convenient for driving the story forward. If you prefer your fiction to be strictly realistic, some elements might require a small leap of faith.

Also, the emotional intensity is quite high. If you're someone who prefers lighter reads or something that doesn't tug so hard on the heartstrings, prepare yourself. This book definitely takes you on an emotional roller coaster, and not every moment is easy. However, for those who love a good, cathartic cry or a story that truly makes you *feel*, this is a major selling point.

### My Recommendation

So, would I recommend *November 9*? Absolutely! Especially if you're a fan of emotional, character-driven love stories with a unique twist. If you're typically into thrillers or psychological fiction but are curious about exploring stories with deep emotional connections, this could be a really great bridge. It has its own kind of suspense—the suspense of human connection and destiny. My personal tip for new readers or those stepping out of their usual genres: just let yourself get swept away by the story and the characters. Don't overthink the ""what ifs"" too much, and just enjoy the ride. It’s a wonderful example of contemporary romance done right, exploring themes of forgiveness, second chances, and fate.

For anyone looking to experience this unique love story, you can find the book and delve into Fallon and Ben's world. Books like this remind us that sometimes the most memorable stories are found outside our usual reading comfort zones.

He carries your boxes, he keeps your cat,

Actual: 298 + grocery list","I sat down to write my thousand words today, armed with ambition, caffeine, and the kind of false confidence usually reserved for cult leaders. 

The result? Two and a half paragraphs of shaky prose and a grocery list that reads like the diary of a deeply unhinged chef. 

“Bananas, duct tape, three bags of shredded cheese, and the courage to keep living.” If word count were calories, I’m starving to death on a toddler’s diet.

Intentions for writers are like New Year’s resolutions: bold, loud, and dead within 48 hours. I wanted to sculpt a chapter, something with tension, arc, maybe even meaning. What I produced instead was a vague sentence about a protagonist walking down a hallway, followed by “don’t forget toilet paper.” Apparently my subconscious believes grocery logistics deserve more urgency than plot progression. And honestly? It’s not wrong.

But here’s the part I cling to: this collapse of ambition is the most universal writer ritual we have. 

We dream in epics and execute in fragments. The story we meant to write gets eaten alive by distractions, laundry, and intrusive thoughts about whether salsa counts as a vegetable. It’s tragic. It’s hilarious. It’s human. We’re not failing—we’re just redirecting our creativity into survival spreadsheets disguised as shopping lists.

So yes, my “masterpiece” today is 298 words of half-baked fiction and a bullet point reminder to buy more coffee filters. 

I could see that as failure, or I could accept it as practice—the kind where the words are still alive, even if they’re not the right ones. In the end, writers don’t measure progress in perfect chapters. We measure it in stubbornness.

While I was studying in the university hallway, a guy sat near me and asked if I had an exam. At first, I didn’t want to answer, but eventually I did. He said he was a student from the neighboring faculty. When I asked him what he was doing here, he seemed a little surprised and said he had taken a course here. Then he talked about the difficulty of his major and confided in me. I stayed calm and listened, and finally I told him good luck, and he left.

When he asked if I had anything else to do, I said “no” out of confusion, and then he and his friend left. I don’t remember the details of that night because of the anxiety—maybe nothing actually happened. Later, I felt a burning sensation, which might have been due to stress. That same night I had a nightmare where a man with a threatening and scary look grabbed my hand and pulled me toward him. I couldn’t defend myself, and he wanted me. I woke up from the dream and couldn’t sleep until morning. Although I was afraid he might come back and harm me, I also felt attached to him. I cried a lot and was completely confused about my feelings. I sobbed and even lost focus on studying. Later, when I thought about that night, I wondered if he had touched me… I laughed, but the laugh was like crying, like a crazy laugh. After that, I had a severe kidney stone attack, which I don’t know if it was related or just a coincidence.

Two months later, he came back and called me. I told him that he had hurt me. At first, he denied it and then accused me of imagining things due to stress and drug use. I didn’t argue with him anymore. He asked me to sit somewhere and talk, have coffee, or something. I went with him but eventually refused, and he left.

Hey Travel Trotters! I've been cruising around the Caribbean on Virgin Voyages and thought I'd share why this unique cruise line might be perfect for your next adventure! If you're tired of conventional cruises with buffet lines and cheesy entertainment, this one's for you.

Virgin Voyages is Sir Richard Branson's adults-only cruise concept that's completely flipped the script on what a cruise experience can be. Let me break down why it's becoming the go-to choice for travelers who previously swore they'd ""never go on a cruise.""

## No Kids, No Problem 🍹

First things first - this is an adults-only experience (18+). While I love the little ones, there's something genuinely refreshing about a vacation space designed purely for adult enjoyment. The vibe is relaxed yet energetic, with no chicken nugget buffets or splash pads in sight!

## Group Travel That Actually Works 👯‍♀️

Planning a friend getaway, bachelor/ette party, or milestone birthday? Virgin's Group Program is LEGIT. Book 180 days in advance and you'll score 10% off, plus each cabin gets a $300 bar tab (hello, free drinks!). They'll even arrange a VIP-style group dinner and offer 30-day price protection.

My college friends and I did this for our reunion and it was honestly the easiest group travel I've ever coordinated.

## Romance On The High Seas ❤️

For all you couples out there, the ""Splash of Romance"" package turns the romance dial to 11. We're talking daily cold-pressed juices delivered to your cabin, thermal spa passes, and chocolate-covered strawberries that are perfect for... well, use your imagination! 😉

## Epic Entertainment That Doesn't Suck 🎭

Forget the cheesy cruise shows of yesteryear. Virgin offers immersive dinner shows like ""Up With a Twist"" (vintage music vibes), murder mystery escape rooms, and a disco-themed extravaganza called ""Disco Reimagined.""

The nightly Pajama Parties are surprisingly fun too - there's something oddly liberating about dancing in your PJs with strangers who become friends by the end of the night!

## Fitness That's Actually Fun 🏃‍♀️

If you're like me and dread gaining the ""cruise 15,"" Virgin's fitness options are surprisingly awesome. ""The Runway"" is a 255-meter red track that circles the entire ship with ocean views. They also offer beach yoga sessions at ports, guided hikes, and meditation classes.

I did a sunrise yoga session in Bimini that honestly might have been worth the entire cruise price.

## Food Without The Buffet Madness 🍽️

Here's where Virgin truly shines. Instead of one massive buffet hall, they offer 20+ eateries included in your fare. From Korean BBQ to elevated Mexican, gourmet vegetarian to fresh Mediterranean - the food is legitimately restaurant-quality.

Pro tip: The Test Kitchen's experimental tasting menu blew my mind, and it's included in your fare!

## No Tipping Required! 💰

That's right - Virgin has a no-gratuity policy. The price you pay includes ALL service charges. No mysterious $15/day per person charges appearing on your bill, no awkward envelope for your room steward. The staff are well-compensated without passenger tips, which creates a more genuine service experience.

## Get Inked At Sea? 🦑

For the ultimate souvenir, Virgin ships feature ""Squid Ink"" - an actual tattoo parlor at sea with world-renowned artists. Yes, you can legitimately get tattooed on your cruise! (Don't worry, they recommend waiting until the last sea day to avoid swimming issues.)

My cabin mate got a small wave design and said the experience was better than most land-based tattoo shops!

## Party Packages That Deliver 🥂

The ""Add a Splash"" program lets you level up any sailing with bottomless brunches, exclusive dinner parties, and complimentary Moet & Chandon champagne. If you're celebrating anything special, this is absolutely worth the splurge.

## Casino That Teaches You To Gamble 🎲

Even if you've never gambled before, Virgin's casino offers gaming lessons for beginners. Their Sea Roller Rewards Program lets you earn points for complimentary drinks or waived fees. Just remember to set your limits!

## My Honest Take

Virgin Voyages isn't for everyone. If you're looking for a traditional cruise experience with formal nights and shuffleboard, this isn't it. But if you want a fresh take on cruising that feels more like a floating boutique hotel with amazing food, adult-oriented fun, and zero kids screaming in the pool - it's perfect.

The ships are medium-sized (about 2,700 passengers), which means no massive lines but still plenty of entertainment options. The design is modern and Instagram-worthy at every turn.

Is it budget-friendly? Not exactly, but considering gratuities are included, all restaurants are covered in your fare, and basic beverages (water, tea, coffee, sodas) are complimentary, the value is better than the sticker price suggests.

I have just been blown away by the food choices and quality since arriving. I had one of the best chocolate desserts I've ever had tonight. As a vegetarian of nearly 30 years I was looking forward to eating a lot of ""Indian"" food, but what has surprised me is the selection of food that is vegetarian but not ""Indian"". Don't get me wrong, I've had fantastic paneer makhani the last few days. However, I've also had veggie burgers, pastas and pizza that were just awesome. Actually, the pizza would have been much better with buffalo mozzarella, but the dough was top notch. 
I am not brave enough to eat the street food, though I have been really  tempted a couple of times! 
Oh! I almost forgot about the espresso and coffee available here! Totally blown away! I've been in hundreds of cafes in Italy, France, England, Canada and USA and Delhi has among the best. Big shout out to Devan's, that place is amazing!

 I have been the head moderator of this forum since early 2022 and since that time I've seen this subreddit grow from 250 subscribers to nearly 41,000 with over 144k average daily unique visitors. (yes that number is real)

 Needless to say I have seen Virgin  Voyages grow from nearly the beginning and have seen it evolve as it's tried new things and learned important lessons.   From this experience I can confidently say that I understand why virgin is making the changes they are, but I can also state unequivocally that they are playing Russian roulette with their most loyal sailors in the process. 

**New Tiers** 

The new tiers are an interesting idea. Basically from what I can see they are trying to make sailing with virgin more accessible to those who are price conscious while also giving those who are willing to pay for it, more options (perks if you will). I have also heard from the rumor mill that the new restriction on not being able to change the primary sailor for the Base and Essential tiers was put in place to reduce the number of people (travel agents mostly) buying up newly released sailings just to resell.  I don’t necessarily think this is great for sailors but I do think it’s an important change to give more people a fair shot at booking a sailing through their preferred method or travel advisor so ultimately I support the change.    Now as for the new tier system itself, I do worry that it’s creating a sudo class system for a cruise line that supposedly embraces equality as the base tier (lock it in rates) are known for being the cabins with noise or visibility issues but are also now going to have the worst internet as well as only a 15 day window for dining reservations meaning that in some cases these sailors are going to have a miserable time and will be vocal about that less than stellar experience.  I also have questions regarding the internet speeds tied to the pricing tiers as not being able to upgrade without being forced up the cabin pricing tiers doesn’t seem fair or reasonable. (I'm hoping to get some clarification from Virgin on this but have yet to hear back due to the weekend)   Now if you look at what we have now verse the Essential tier which we are told is equivalent to what we have today minus the ability to change the primary sailor, the premium tier is basically just the current added cost of premium interment ($30) plus the $15 per night bar tab so other than the perceived value of “priority sailor services” there’s actually no real value add, it’s just prepaid upgrades.  For me personally this is actually a downgrade as I typically don’t drink, I hate coffee and basically have no use for a bar tab other than maybe using it to pay for the absurd ship eats service fee. 

This tier system really starts to fall apart however when you look at the rockstar tiers as not including the best internet available for people paying triple or more of what other sailors are paying to be on the ship is short sighted as-is only making it one device per cabin. The idea of making lock it in rates for these rockstar sailors is also dumb in my opinion, although someone pointed out to me that it could be advantageous to last minute bookings,  but I guess we will see how that plays out.  The headlines about someone not being able to rebook a $25,000 cruise after someone has a health issue however is inevitable so I’m sure that press will be fun to talk about (that’s sarcasm). 



**Tipping / gratuities** 

***Let me be a blunt as possible, I F#%\*\^!% hate tipping culture.***  We, and I do believe that’s most of us Virgin Voyages fans, were of the understanding that Virgin was a no tipping cruise line. I was however informed repeatedly over a nearly 40 minute phone call with a Virgin Voyages representative ( I won’t name them but they are fairly high on the totem pole) that in fact Virgin Voyages was a Gratuities included cruise line.  Basically what this means is Virgin has always been charging us for tips (gratuities) but not giving us the option to opt out and they have allowed the public to perpetuate this false belief that they were a no tipping cruise line. ( I'm 100% guilty of perpetuating this too as a mod here, and I would like to apologize for that.)  Ultimately they are making this change because California law is forcing them to make the gratuity (tipping) charges transparent.  The other thing I was told however is that this change will also help Virgin be more competitive in pricing as now their fare pricing will be more of an apples to apples (tips not included to tips not included) comparison on any websites that sorts by price  instead of tips included (Virgin)to tips not included (every other cruise line).   In this I understand but I feel very mislead and quite frankly pissed off that Virgin Voyages allowed this false perception to exist while still paying crew via the very tips I despise.  Now what I was told via phone is this pay via tips thing was setup in large part because it’s the cruise industry standard and it’s what crew is used to. Their base pay is still orders of magnitude larger than other cruise lines ([https://shiplife.org/salaries/ ](https://shiplife.org/salaries/)) but ultimately they are paid via these gratuities/tips that Virgin has been rolling into their fare pricing since the beginning instead of what most of us believed that they were being paid larger salaries instead of relying on tips.   The thing that really pisses me off about this however is  Virgin had the opportunity to just eliminate tips/gratuities all together and force positive change to the entire cruise industry and they instead chose to mislead their customers.  It’s ultimately is why Loyal Virgin cruisers are so up in arms about these changes. We were essentially lied to for years. This ironically is the thing the Virgin representative couldn’t understand about why the community was so upset about this announcement. In their eyes, this is all been transparent from the beginning and I suppose in a way it has been with the “gratuities included” marketing language but the reality is that’s not what we the Virgin sailors thought we were investing in.  

\------------------------

ok so I’ve said my peace but I need you to understand this: **if you take nothing else away from this post please know Virgin executives are actively reading your posts and are paying attention to the fallout from this announcement.**  It’s extremely important that you vote in the [polls](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1nqzt0b/unscientific_poll_how_do_you_feel_about_new/) and be vocal about your opinions  [voyagefairchoicesfeedback@virginvoyages.com](mailto:voyagefairchoicesfeedback@virginvoyages.com)  as they do truly matter more now than ever.  



Keep in mind that the Virgin Representative that I mentioned above reached out to me on their own. This is not normal for the corporate world but it is entirely normal for virgin. They want to offer a world class product we love. They don’t always listen but they are trying and that’s commendable.  BTW as a side note, the conversation was cordial and I do feel like I was taken seriously. 

Also, one of the positive things that came out of my phone conversation with the Virgin rep was an agreement to participate in an AMA.  As soon as I can schedule this I’m going to do so but in the mean time **keep up the feedback and stay loud.**

I was just… there.

A year ago, I couldn’t even get out of bed without a pit in my stomach. I felt like life was happening at me, not with me. But today I realized I’ve slowly built little routines that keep me afloat, texting a friend every morning, journaling even when it’s just “I feel tired,” and saying yes to small things like going for a walk when I’d normally cancel.

It’s not some dramatic Hollywood turnaround, but damn, I’m grateful. Grateful for the tiny wins stacking up. Grateful for the version of me that didn’t give up. And grateful that I can finally take a deep breath and actually mean it.

‼️SPOILER‼️ LONG POST🥴 
☑️I have realized that some of the people that played Bioshock 2 don’t really understand what would have happened if Sinclair didn’t die at the end of the game. They realistically and really have to analyze this character to acknowledge that he was capable of doing irreversible damage to the surface if he lived. 
As we know Rapture failed because of the greed for money and power of the people and of course the other things that come with it like arrogance, pride and craziness of having the power to do absolutely everything in the city moral or not. But Sinclair wasn’t a common businessman he was a ➡️bad visionary businessman⬅️ this means that he knew before hand where was the city going into (with the plasmids, ADAM, poverty, experimentation etc.) and he provided with his firm Sinclair Solutions tons of products and services that feed this need to the city (and really guys if you have heard his audio diaries I can tell you HE. DIDNT. GIVE. A. D…) using poor people without any hesitation (like slaves) and later on using rich people like him when the Civil War was going on and Ryan needed more plasmids (hehe wasn’t he lovely) so back to the point. He got what he deserved by staying 8 years on the same conditions of hunger and lack of freedom he had given to the people he used back in his prison or in Paupers Drop. 
When Delta arrives as we know at the beginning of his deal with him he is only using him and if you really listen to the dialogues when he chats with Delta he mocks him (like in the Drop when he tells Delta that Big Daddies are only slaves and he recently broke free WTH man thanks of the compliment 🥴) he does this because Delta is a good person and doesn’t use other people when he can decide and even helps them, Sinclair says that this is a BIG LIABILITY but meh Delta is a good boy (I love him ❤️) So at the end in Persephone his feelings for Delta have changed because of his journey with him (like saving him on Siren Alley and Delta winning nothing because of this) and goes helping Delta we know what happens and guys I was really sad too of what happened to him but really know that I have realized of all of this, his end was for the best and is more meaningful. We all want to imagine what would have happened but cannon when Delta was arriving to Eleanor he even said that he had to put feelings aside (because Delta was a prisoner and Sinclair sold him like a thing to experimentation) and focus on the present like the past didn’t matter at all. So with this in mind of imagining him not dying in Rapture, I think that if he hadn’t turn into a big daddy and still was a human, he would have escaped with Delta and Eleanor but he would have sold lots of stuff that where in Rapture like normal things (like the coffee flask that never goes cold Wow I want one of those 🥹) but remember that greed is really strong and he has chosen that way before so the question here is:
➡️¿What would have stopped him from selling ADAM on the surface?⬅️
Delta? Remember that Delta was going to die because of the link with Eleanor 😭 (sad I know still haven’t recovered)
Eleanor? I don’t know, remember he has Deltas memories of forgiveness but I don’t know if she could have stopped him 😔
Sofia? Dead surely or mentally damaged because of Eleanors choice of rejecting her. 
Jack? No, leave him alone with his girls 🤨
So in the end folks I just have to say ¿Can you imagine ADAM up here? ¿The war,destruction, pain, suffering and despair that would have happend? And as I said before he really doesn’t care at all, he has done it before and in fact he almost said in the game he would be the happiest man on earth with all that money (Dionysus park). I know he redeemed himself and helped Delta, I know he changed and I respect that really. But it only has the importance and weight it has because of what happens in the game.  But guys we can’t lie to ourselves that Sinclair would have ruined millions of lives on the surface because of his greed. 😞That is the problem with lying when someone wants you to believe in him and he has broken your trust you can’t see him with the same eyes. 
➡️If you have reach here thanks for reading 💚💚⬅️
Leave your comments so we can amplify our opinions 💚
Don’t misunderstand me I really love this character and I feel it doesn’t get the light he should have, but I feel that his end is better that imagining other. But I would say if Delta haven’t died I wonder what would have happened… 🥹",0,1758998611.0,Bioshock,8,0.4,False

Most dudes actually love practical stuff or upgrades to things they already use. Think about it.... guys usually aren't out buying themselves new wallets, better socks or nice cologne unless theirs are completely falling apart. So when they get something useful and a little nicer than what they'd buy for themselves it feel like an upgrade to their daily life. And it doesn't have to be some huge expensive thing.

Here's a solid list that never misses (at least from what I've seen).

* **Everyday essentials** – good quality wallet, belt, socks. 
* **Grooming gear** – electric shaver, beard kit, nice cologne (safe/fresh scent).
* **Tech gadgets** – wireless earbuds, portable charger, smart home gadget.
* **Clothes that fit their vibe** – hoodie, plain tees, cap (stuff they’ll wear daily).
* **Favorite drink/snack** – nice whiskey, craft beer, coffee beans, jerky.
* **Hobby-related gifts** – tools, sports gear, gaming accessories, etc.
* **Experience gifts** – concert tickets, sports game, cool activity (go-kart, axe throwing).
* **WFH or desk upgrades** – mouse pad, monitor stand, cool desk light.
* **Quality time gift** – plan a date he doesn’t have to organize. 🙃

Bottom line it's not about spending big. It's about showing you actually paid attention to what he like and uses. Even grabbing his fav snack or drink can hit harder than a pricey gadget... because it shows you notice the little things about him. ",1,1758998555.0,u_Personal-Weekend3173,0,1.0,False

I've only tried oatmilk once, and it wasn't in coffee, so I could be mistaken, but the flavor didn't come through at all. Would the espresso have covered up the flavor?

I'm torn on whether I should contact the store, because I don't particularly care if they gave me the wrong milk, but I have family members with severe dairy allergies, so to me it's something that should be addressed.

Guys,  I haven’t been this excited about a flavor of something, ANYTHING, since I had the best steak of my life.

So, back when I went to the hospital for a UTI, I was in IFS therapy and was writing with either a part or, what I believe, is god. It could just be a ""part"" that behaves like my understanding of God. 

So, I had a notebook where this God part wrote to me, and he said he liked that I was kind without virtue signaling. I think the doctor read this and then the nurses kinda treated me some typa way.

This is my issue with the left. I was a hard-core leftist for so long. Now like, I'm not going to go vote for an evil billionaire that wants everyone dead, but I'm sick of the left. It's too extreme. 

Nobody can be nice or talk about accomplishments without it being a ""virtue signal"". Nobody can be friendly and say nice things to people without ""love bombing."" If someone tries to explain their damage to express where they're coming from, they're ""emotionally blackmailing"". If someone tries to make peace after an argument, they're a ""toxic manipulator."" 

I believe I connected to God through ifs, and what happened after was a lot. I did believe some delusions, I believe I was being tested, and my therapist accuses me of ""wanting to be special."" 

You have emotions and you're judgemental. If you don't think anything but pretty, perfect, happy thoughts, you're a bad person. 

If the Bible says that having a thought is just as bad as doing something, and leftists hate Christianity for this puritanical thought-police mindset, why are they out here being puritanical thought police? 

This is a big reason why so many young men are republicans. All this weaponized therapy speak, the lack of understanding, the severe judgement, cancel culture, no forgiveness for mistakes is driving men to vote for evil people who want to destroy the world. There's no understanding, no meeting people halfway, no communication, and no love among the left anymore. 

I'm not about to go vote for an authoritarian asshole, that's for sure. I don't hate any individual human and I have compassion for everyone. I can't believe that's an unacceptable view to have in my political party. Yeah, there's people who literally want me dead because of my disabilities and I still don't hate them. I'm not standing from a point of high privilege and saying we should sympathize with evil mindsets. What we need to do is be more compassionate, have gentle discussions, and help guide people to a more peaceful way. 

I'm so sick of everything a person does being politicized. Our bodies are politicized, our interests, our ages, our every experience is being turned political so we all fight each other and give shitty people power. 

It's sad. I feel like there's no humanity in politics. There's just a bunch of fighting fire with fire. 

I've turned to God and seek the Truth in all things. If God is love, and love is real, then love is my god and I must act with love. I don't need to feel affectionate to love, but I love deeply. My political standpoint is to love people, stand up for what's right, and to teach a better way. We must also put our egos aside, listen to the opposition, understand their pain, and either be willing to change an opinion or show them something better. 

I sometimes explain myself poorly or have my ideas warped by others' own perceptions of things. If someone says ""I don't drink coffee, I prefer tea"" someone else might understand that to mean ""coffee is evil and I'm better than you for not drinking it."" Because of these frequent misunderstandings and struggles to communicate, I try to understand where people are coming from and just see most people as lost and suffering when they act unkindly. This empathy gets me into trouble, but it's better than living with a blackened, bitter heart. 

Anyway, that's my two cents.

She does prefer when I make her a coffee/espresso/moka pot if we have the time to prepare something better.   

Has come up with a ‘push button solution’ that provides a similar output with marginal fuss, with better results?     

I can’t really seem to find a solution that fits perfectly.   The moccamaster is likely the closest but I would greatly prefer espresso shots.   Neither of us use any sort of milk/cream in our coffees.

At first it was great!  They had a cat door to go out anytime they wanted and loved it.  However, I have some feral cats who I feed and who practically live in the backyard.  I am not getting rid of them as I could not do that anymore than getting rid of the orange cat.  They are all fixed by TNR already.  My orange boy cat became territorial and started marking inside the house.  

This was awful and took time and drastic measures, but he has finally stopped marking.  In order to fix him from marking I had to stop him from going outside on the covered patio, cover up the cat door entirely, and cover the window facing the backyard, and now he is banned from my bedroom as well (don't ask it was horrible).  I do let him in the garage which he likes, but he is desperately bored even after getting many toys/cat puzzles to play with.  He is also loud when bored which drives my anxiety through the roof!!  I do not have enough time in the day to play with him enough for him to not be bored everyday.  I've tried feliway to see if he'd chill out, but I see no difference in behavior after 2 months.  He still has windows facing the front lawn which he just doesn't care for. 

I am thinking of buying a big enclosure, attaching it by tunnel to the screened in porch and letting him live outside in that year-round. Rehoming him is NOT a option as I don't trust anyone to care for this cat as much as I do.  I spend every morning and afternoon on the porch with my cup of coffee, a good book and my other way more chill cat, so I'd spend time with him often. 

 The problem is once he has access to being back on the porch and new enclosure he can never return to live in the house due to his spraying.  He'd have to stay out there with only closely supervised visits inside once in awhile.  The patio is covered and big and the new enclosure would be about 10 feet by 9 feet or so.  It is also inside a huge fenced in back yard so no wild animals would get near him.  He'd get to see the feral cats again who never really bothered him personally.  They would touch noses through the screen and he'd try to bat at them, but that it.  I think he'd be happier outside overall, and this would help my anxiety from his constant meowing.

Around age 30 I flared up really bad and it was ongoing for a year and I didn’t know what it was. It came down to coffee and the baby spinach salad. Apparently these can heat up the body and cause inflammation. I cut these and I was free again and my skin cleared. For the last few years, I’ve been suffering loads with full body blown eczema. No food allergies this time. It’s my gut for sure and I know. My diet was terrible, no fiber, no fruit, no vegetables etc. I lived on processed foods, sugary drinks, sugary snacks and alcohol. I saw all these gut videos online and I’m certain it’s my gut. I’ve been on my eczema friendly diet for 6 weeks now. 

During the last 18 months I’ve been using steroids on and off and been moisturising daily. My steroid is betnovate 0.1 cream and also betnovate 0.025 cream and also I use aproderm ointment daily to moisturise. My eczema is severe and steroid is needed to calm me down and get through the day. I haven’t had any oral tablets or immunosuppressants or other injections like dupixent etc. I’m on my eczema healing journey. I must admit, I feel great with my mood but it’ll take a good few months before I hopefully start seeing results on my skin. I believe I had nutrient and vitamin deficiency a lot. 

That’s some background on myself. I just want to know please, I’ve seen a lot of stuff about tsw (topical steroid withdrawal). I feel for anyone who has had it or going through it. However, can I know more details please. For example, exactly how long and how often you used creams, the exact cream, your age and gender, if you was on oral tablets or immunosuppressants or dupixent or predisnone etc, your location, your symptoms. Like did u completely stop using steroid cream and that’s it or did u try to taper down? I see a lot of people online on Reddit saying they have tsw but they don’t really explain any detail with their history to try help others. This is a lot of questions I know and I’m sorry but I think it’ll really help myself and alot more people who find this post. A lot of people are claiming to have tsw after 2 weeks of steroid use etc. The people who have actually had it and they know it’s tsw, I would definitely like to know more detail about your history of usage as mentioned above. 

Thank you so much. ",2,1758997701.0,eczema,1,1.0,False
1ns2j54,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ns2j54/airscape_canister_size_small_or_medium_space/,Airscape canister size. Small or medium? [Space],"Greetings fellow coffee lovers,

I have a great dilemma regarding the Airscape canister size for my coffee beans. I can’t decide between the small (250g) and the medium (500g). Normally, I buy my coffee in 250g bags. When I purchase 1kg, I use 250g in my current container, and the remaining 3 × 250g portions I vacuum-seal and store in the freezer.

Based on Airscape specifications, the small Airscape canister should be sufficient, but I’m concerned it might be too small. Perhaps it’s just in my head 😀. On the other hand, I worry that the medium (500g) might be too big, since I usually only store 250g at a time. And there will be canister allways half full (I'm not concerned about the air... It is pushed out...) and I'll have to scrape the beans from the bottom with spoon ...

Could you please advise me on which size would be more practical? 

Many thanks for your help!",1,1758997699.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Don't expect a big scare out of this one. However, this story *is* some of my best work, in my opinion.)



Fixer-upper might have been a little bit misleading.

Perry doesn’t necessarily blame the agent. The business of selling real estate is, of course, sales, and therefore sometimes requires the truth to be massaged a bit. But calling this a fixer-upper is like saying that Perry’s Subaru could probably use a tune up; true, technically, but glossing over the situation a bit. The Subaru’s odometer had rolled over to 400,000 on the drive up here, and this house is less of a fixer-upper and more of a bulldoze-this-eyesore-and-start-over. 

But it’s also within their price range, and it’s on the historical register. Actually, it’s in their price range *because* it’s on the register. The county is willing to donate the home and the supplies needed to restore it, assuming Perry and Melissa are willing to do the manual labor to change this ruin back into the manor it once was. They are, and so the deal is going forward. They have been told that renovations must be completed by July 1st of next year; this gives them a year and three months. It’s a big job, but the realtor assures them that it’s completely doable. The young couple is responsible for the restoration and upkeep of the home - also, they had to sign a waiver. They are not allowed to sue the county if they get eaten. The manor has zombies.

The little Montana mansion was built in 1880 after the original homesteading family gave up on the land; It becomes apparent to Perry that the mansion’s hilltop placement was a strategic choice. The tree line sits a good two, in some places three hundred yards away from the building. Plenty of distance to spot an incoming horde of shambling undead and batten down the hatches. The original homesteaders, the Perkins family, had built their cabin in the shadow of the big ponderosas. Rookie mistake. The stone foundation of the cabin is still just barely visible if Perry uses his binoculars, which he was advised to bring by the local general store owner, and who also looked at Perry as if he had three heads when he said he bought the Perkins land. 

“Use the binoculars,” the man had said. “Some of them zombies you can shoot, but some of them’s on the register too. Get a good clean ID before you pull the trigger. Ammo’s down aisle five.”

The patriarch of the Perkins clan, Cyril James Perkins, probably hadn’t intended to join the undead that infested his woods. He almost certainly didn’t know they were there; In the 1870s, westward expansion was the drive to build on this particular parcel. The reason to come back is the housing crisis. But between those two driving forces, nobody has been unfortunate enough or brave enough to call this place home, with the notable exception of the mansion’s original owner, and he skipped town a month after the manor’s completion. He wasn’t afraid of the undead. He had fled a far greater terror: unpaid creditors.

Today, Cyril is still ambling around the property. The guys from the department of corpse management were nice enough to come out and tag Cyril so that he’ll be at least a little easier to manage. He’s the mostly skeletal one wearing a bright yellow DoCM safety vest. He’s on the register, so he stays, even if Perry gets a clean shot; Perry wonders idly who exactly is going to check and see if Cyril is still upright, but he also doesn’t feel like messing with government bureaucracy. He has a healthy fear of high interest rates, food poisoning, and the IRS, in that order. Desiccated walking corpses don’t even make it into the top ten.

“Oh look, there’s a little garden,” Melissa says. She’s looking at a patch of dirt demarcated from the surrounding scrub by a loose border of small boulders. “I wonder what grows well here.”

“Dirt seems to do pretty well,” gripes Perry. “You could probably scare up some rattlesnakes too, if you really wanted to. Do they get zombie virus?” Perry is not a pessimist, though his friends might call him one. He frequently sees all of the things that could go wrong and then addresses them aggressively. He has a history of winning situations that most people would consider unworthy of even trying to beat. He is known for his refusal to take acetaminophen. He prefers to just complain about the aches and pains and have a beer. Melissa loves him dearly, but wishes he’d just take the obvious solution once in a while. Perry’s favorite adages are about work; according to him, there’s rarely time to do a job right, but never time to do it twice.

“I bet I could get some blueberries to do alright out here,” Melissa continues. She knows better than to engage with Perry’s grumbling. “And if we get irrigation put in, I could grow corn. Maybe put in a chicken coop over there, and there you go, that’s everything you need for blueberry cornbread.”

“Look at us, huh? Homeowners.”

“Homeowners,” She beams. She believes that this place will be where they can start a family and a legacy. She can already envision the homey plaque over the door: Welcome to the Wynne Family Homestead. The house can become their love letter to their future children. She can see them clearly in her imagination. She wants two, a boy and a girl. 

“Except zombies eat chickens, don’t they?” Perry frowns. “I guess I could put up a fence.” But even he isn’t immune to the optimism of the moment. “Oh, hell. A fence isn’t so much work. Just let me get the roof patched first.” He smiles. Melissa sees, as she has so often lately, the man she fell in love with. He takes her hand and, together, they climb the steps up to the threshold of their very own fixer-upper.

\#

“Sweetheart, we’ve got one over by the old homestead again,” Melissa calls out. She’s gotten the blueberry bushes in and she was right, they’re thriving. She is out pulling up scrub bushes to make way for further planting. Perry is inside rebuilding the wood floors in the eastern side of the manor. He keeps the windows open both for the fresh breezes that come rolling in off the windy, barren hill, but also so that he can keep an ear out for occasions such as this. 

He stands up from his work and walks to the window, picking up the beastly old rifle he keeps there. It’s an ancient Mauser, a bolt action behemoth with 1940 ANKARA K. KALE and a Turkish moon symbol stamped across the receiver; a military surplus gun with plentiful, reasonably cheap surplus ammunition. He found it at the general store for $150. He finds the zombie in question out near the tree line.

“Cover your ears, dear,” he calls down to his wife. She shouts back that she’s ready, and he pops on his own earmuffs and sights down the weapon. He steadies his breathing and gently squeezes the trigger. The Mauser barks, kicks back into his shoulder. The force rocked him back on his heels the first time he fired the gun, but he’s ready for it by now. His shoulder sports a splotchy purple bruise most days. The Mauser has a steel buttplate.

As he hears the gunshot echo back to him, reflected off of the wall of trees, he watches the zombie’s head turn to pulp and spray across the stone foundation; he makes a note to head out that way and hose that down before it has a chance to get baked onto the rocks in the sunshine. 

They have been living in and restoring the manor for three months now. Summer is in its zenith and the home, with its cutting-edge-for-1880 design, lacks air conditioning. Perry is irritable and yet optimistic; Melissa is sunshine itself, welcoming every morning with a happy little hummed tune as she retracts the heavy bars that reinforce the steel security doors. She has hung up a little hummingbird feeder, and against Perry’s assertion that there are no hummingbirds out here, it has become quite the hotspot. The glinting red glass does attract a zombie once, which Perry takes care of by giving it a good whomping with the butt of the Mauser. He is nearly bitten, and it is an excellent reminder to keep the gun loaded.

Cyril is a constant nuisance. His hi-vis vest was helpful at first, but fell off at some point and now adorns a sharp tree branch a hundred yards into the woods. As relatively safe as the scrub is, the forest itself is a deathtrap. Patient, motionless corpses can wait behind any tree, silent as death and only noticed once they lunge. Perry has watched deer be ambushed by the ancient residents of those woods, and even he is not belligerent enough to try and retrieve the yellow vest from its likely permanent home among the pines. For now, Cyril can be identified through binoculars. 

This fails to mitigate Cyril’s looming presence one bit. His empty eyeholes glow like dull embers late at night. He shows an animal cunning and will sometimes even knock on the door. Perry has grown deeply tired of his unwanted neighbor and uses a pool cleaning net to wrangle him back to the woods whenever possible. 

“Hi Cyril,” He says as he plops the long net around the ancient evil’s shoulders. “Can you go somewhere else, man? I’m trying to build equity here.” Cyril does not respond; he’s rude that way. Perry has nearly been bitten by Cyril twice, and once, Melissa doesn’t notice him until he is just on the other side of the clothesline, grasping at her through the clean linens. It ends alright, at least, with Cyril becoming too tangled in the bedsheet to see where he is going. As he ambles off toward the trees, a glaring Perry grips the Mauser tightly. 

“I’m fine, sweetheart,” Melissa reassures him. He keeps his eyes locked firmly on Cyril.

“Perry.” She says his name with authority. “I said I’m fine.”

He nods and relaxes a bit. He knows she’s right. Destroying Cyril is grounds for the county to void their mortgage.

\#

Winter washes over the manor and puts the world into soft white stasis. Perry has time to go into the forest and get the yellow vest because the corpses are all frozen solid, but he finds that the vest is also frozen quite firmly in its new woody home. He leaves it there rather than spend too much time in the woods, which are plenty eerie even without the dead lurching after him. Cyril has become a wintertime statue in the garden, and Perry nails a sign to him. Melissa chastises him for profanity, and now the repainted sign says “I am a gigantic pain in the butt” instead. 

Their realtor makes a point of visiting Melissa and Perry that January, bringing a late albeit still appreciated housewarming gift. Brenda Thornton, as perpetually smiling as she is in her daytime TV commercials, turns up on the porch with a bottle of sherry and a voucher for a free oil change. It’s a savvy gift; Perry’s battered Subaru is on its last legs, and even an oil change is an expense the cash-strapped couple can hardly afford. Every dollar they have is tied up in this place.

“Hello, you two lovebirds!” She says this every time she sees them for reasons Perry cannot fathom. Brenda has the unenviable tendency to try and be their best friend, even though they barely know her, and the word that Melissa uses to describe the woman in private is saccharine. Perry uses several other words, many of which are four letters long.

“I just thought I’d stop by,” Brenda says without losing a fraction of her smile, “and see how things are going on the renovations. Can I bother you two for the tour?” Melissa warmly welcomes her in, and Perry does his best to not look grumpy. He even smiles, though it’s forced. 

He knows that this is not a social call. 

On top of the quite healthy and non-refundable fee they paid for Brenda’s services in the first place, their mortgage comes with a very specific schedule to renovate the manor. It needs to be done and ready for inspection by the coming July. Brenda is here to look for signs of contract breach, and the Wynnes have plenty of them to worry about. The wood they have been provided lately is warped and the insulation has been substandard, and despite Perry’s best efforts, they simply cannot be used. Shoddy insulation is only half of the reason for the chill that creeps into the air while they show Brenda the extensive updates. 

She holds her phone in front of her like a talisman, recording everything down to the minutest detail. The smile never budges, and in her haste to capture the litany of little problems, she still manages not to smudge her designer heels in the areas Perry has yet to finish. 

“The wood’s a little bit off,” Perry says as they review the results of Brenda’s inspection. They sit at the kitchen table, two mismatched thrift store glasses of sherry and a lemonade in front of them. Melissa does not drink alcohol; it gives her a ferocious hangover ever since she turned thirty. The lemonade cup gathers condensation. Nobody is touching their glasses. 

Brenda’s smile doesn’t leave her face, but it does take on a patronizing edge. Perry doesn’t relent.

“We’re having trouble with the wood that’s getting dropped off,” He continues. “It’s the planks they’re giving us for the flooring. A lot of it’s twisted.”

Brenda is scrolling on her cell phone. “I noticed that.” She turns the phone to him. There is a photo of the east hallway. “See that? That flooring is just all wrong. We’re going to have to do that whole hallway again. Let me talk to the lumberyard, I’ll get it all sorted out.” She smiles.

The room thaws a little. Perry takes a tentative sip of his sherry; he’s a beer guy, but he certainly isn’t about to turn down a nice gift. He has been afraid to say more than a few words until now. He has been terrified that Brenda will tell him that faulty materials are hardly a valid reason to amend the contract and that they are out of luck. For the first time since Cyril froze solid beside the compost heap, The Wynnes have something to lighten their spirits. Perry and Melissa even find themselves enjoying the visit. Perry explains his strategy for keeping the zombies at the tree line. Melissa tells an amusing story about the garden. More drinks are poured, and the house glows with joy. They are not going to lose their house because of junk timber after all. 

The undead lurk outside, but for the first time in a long time, nobody in the Wynne house is afraid. 

\#

Springtime comes in lush and wet, drizzling much needed rain onto the parched scrubland. Thunderstorms rumble pleasantly over them, but the roof is repaired and they stay happily indoors, working by candlelight on thrift store puzzles that inevitably fail to contain all one thousand pieces. They welcome a new member to the family; Perry suggests they call him Mauser so that he will be strong and help protect the house. Melissa overrules him and names him Spark Plug. Spark Plug is a cat.

But even with progress, there is little sleep to be had in the Wynne household. Perry works on coffee and stubbornness; he feels the deadline approaching at a gallop. Melissa spends her days hanging wallpaper that exactly matches the manor’s original style. The entirety of the east rooms have been restored, and Perry’s handiwork shines. He was once a carpenter. It shows. Even Spark Plug gets into the spirit of things and stages a one-cat war on the mice in the basement. Melissa keeps a tally of his victories and is somewhat alarmed when the number keeps rising well past thirty. They have not had time to begin dealing with the rodent problem.

The trouble they come across feels bottomless. When Perry descends into the basement to lay mousetraps, flashlight in hand, he discovers that some of the ceiling beams are dangerously rotten. This was not discussed in the original agreement, but it certainly needs to be fixed. He does not own the proper equipment to lift heavy new beams into place, but he is a clever man and makes do with pulleys and rope. He pulls a muscle in his back, but will not rest; he just helps Melissa do some of the less strenuous work for a few days before returning to carpentry. There is no time to lose. The house is poised to reveal a new, unforeseen issue roughly every few days. When they discover an ancient, nearly mummified zombie in the locked attic, they lure it outside with Spark Plug’s mouse trophies before destroying it. There’s no reason to make an even bigger mess indoors.

Perry’s work never stops. He works until the day’s work is done, even when the day itself has long since given up the ghost and then he works by flashlight. He finds time, between blasting zombies and recreating century-old architecture, to make the sign that Melissa has dreamed about since the moment they saw the manor’s online listing. In firm, cerulean letters over a clean white background, it says “Welcome to the Wynne Family Homestead.” Like the manor itself, the sign’s woodwork is all Perry, and the paint is done with Melissa’s artistic flair. A painted green vine rolls along the border of the sign, popping blooming blue flowers onto the white background. Someday, Melissa promises, the front of the manor will have morning glories that match the ones she’s painted on the sign. It’s a small victory, but a significant one. The place feels more like home than ever.

But despite these small, successful battles, they cannot help but feel they are losing the broader war. Their original repair plans have been amended and added onto so many times that they only vaguely resemble the job they set out to do; the discovery of rotten beams, crumbling masonry, and rodent colonies has revealed their initial appraisal to be so much wishful thinking. If the house hadn’t so successfully hidden its deeper cancers, they may have never taken on the project at all; as it is, they have two more months to complete a list that seems as foully undying as their shambling neighbors. Perry assures his wife that they will make the cutoff. He is one to roll the dice even when the odds are against him, to play the entire hand of cards before he admits defeat. But Melissa has caught him up late at night, pacing the renovated kitchen with a beer in one hand and a to-do list in the other, now and then taking a heavy sigh. He puts on a brave face for her, as he always does, and she doesn’t have the heart to tell him that she knows it’s just an act. Still, they press on. The Wynnes do not know what it is to fight from an advantageous position. They never have. For them, this is just one more uphill expedition, and they have every intention of making it to the top.

\#

The deadline arrives before the last of the lumber. Instead of holding a housewarming, the Wynnes are packing the same cardboard boxes they arrived with. They haven’t made the deadline. The coughing and spluttering Subaru chugs down the rough dirt road away from the manor. The interior of the car is silent except for the tires chewing away at gravel and bumping through the occasional pothole. Perry doesn’t speak. He doesn’t know what to say. Melissa doesn’t either, but she tries anyway. 

“Maybe we can appeal to someone,” she offers. “The manor isn’t going anywhere, and maybe if there are no buyers…” She doesn’t finish the thought. She and Perry have already had this discussion with Brenda, who explained that their deadline was simply up the same way she might explain Chutes and Ladders to an unhappy child. Sorry, that’s just the way the game goes. Back to square one for you! She didn’t even stop filling out the paperwork canceling their contract, her monogrammed pen flicking this way and that, the hefty packet of papers resting on their scuffed and thrifted card table. Couldn’t they have an extension? Considering the state of advanced disrepair the house had been in, weren’t they entitled to another thirty days or so? Melissa pointed to the jar of spent Mauser cartridges on the windowsill; forty seven zombies dispatched, plus the one Perry clubbed on the front porch. Wasn’t *that* worth a little more time? 

Brenda’s plastic smile never budged. Rules are rules, she told them, and slid the heap of papers across the table to them. Sign here and here, please, then get the hell out of the house that is no longer yours. Buh-bye.

The house practically shines. Melissa had finished painting the outside of the rambling structure just the day before Brenda came to take it away, the former wreck atop the hill now a cheery periwinkle blue. All that is left to fix is the attic, and even that is a minor job. Another month at most, assuming they don’t discover silverfish or warped beams or a portal to hell. Even the portal could probably be dealt with given some extra plywood, but then, Perry reasons, Brenda would lose her shortcut into the place.

The reality of the situation, Perry suspects, is that Brenda knew the job was too big for just a year and a half. Sign up a couple of broke and too-ambitious people to flip the place, then drop the hammer on them when it isn’t done in the allotted time. They get nothing at all if they fail to complete the renovations, not even payment for their work. As soon as the papers were reluctantly signed, Brenda practically skipped through the house removing any personal effects. Melissa held her breath when the peppy realtor flagged them down on the way out; Perry stopped the Subaru and hand-cranked down the window. Perhaps she would show some mercy, or have some sort of deal they could strike – but no, she was merely handing them the sign from the front door with a phony look of sympathy. As they reached the end of the gravel driveway and lost sight of the house, Melissa did her best to sniffle back tears. They are ten minutes from the house when Melissa speaks up again.

“Perry!” she shouts, startling them both; she is much louder in the cramped little car than she means to be. Perry stomps the brakes. “Perry, Spark Plug!”

Of course, Spark Plug had skittered to one of his many hiding spots the moment Brenda knocked on the door. He has lived outside with the zombies for years and he knows evil when he sees it. Currently, he is sitting in the East upper bedroom’s window, where the Mauser he was nearly named after had rested. He is watching a shamelessly gleeful Brenda busying herself with initial changes to the manor; she intends to have this place back on the market within the week. She may even purchase it herself. Any of the Wynnes’ personal effects have to go, though their updates to the house can stay. Only the garden escapes her scrutiny. A woman wearing $600 heels isn’t about to go tromping around between corn stalks. Spark Plug watches her adjust things here and there, picking up the shovel Melissa has left leaning against the house and moving the lawn sprinkler that Perry has been using to entice the lawn into some shade resembling green. Then her eyes swing across the tree line, and she spots a garish splotch of fluorescent yellow.

The ruckus is nearly over by the time Melissa has bundled Spark Plug into her arms and is ready to leave the fixer-upper forever. Far down the hill, the forest is in an uproar. The tree line swims with shadowy movement, and Brenda’s wild shrieks carry easily in the still summer air. Melissa spies snippets of her stylish blouse through the trees; it looks like she’s carrying Cyril’s lost safety vest in one long-nailed hand. Perry charges up the staircase with his rifle, working the bolt and preparing to fire. In winter, the angle from the window gives the best view of the tree line. But In the height of summer the trees hide far too much for him to identify any good target. Even if he has a shot, what can he do? Brenda has wandered into a hornet’s nest. She’s going to get stung. 

By the time Perry finally spots a zombie wandering out of the tree line, he knows Brenda is bitten, if not devoured outright. Besides, the corpse he spots is Cyril. He is gnawing absentmindedly on a designer high heeled shoe. 

\#

The realtor assigned to the manor after Brenda’s devouring is a much more lenient woman. She inspects the old house and is pleased at how much the Wynnes have achieved already; she happily files an extension on their contract, gives Spark Plug a hearty scritch behind his ears, and congratulates the Wynnes on their new home. With a flair for the dramatic, she even recommends that the Wynnes put Cyril into a settler costume and start an Instagram for him; Perry declines. 

Even without the Instagram fame, Perry and Cyril’s relationship grows. When Cyril knocks on the door early in the morning, Perry pretends to be annoyed about it and then takes the ancient frontiersman for a walk anyhow. Now and then he will buy a pair of ladies’ pumps at the thrift store and throw them for Cyril. This turns out to be a sound investment. With Cyril’s three remaining teeth, he can happily gnaw on a pair of shoes for a month before he needs another. Between his preoccupation with eating footwear and the bell Perry manages to hang around his neck, Cyril’s presence becomes almost pleasant.

The Wynnes find themselves in a situation they have never before enjoyed: For one shining season, they are actually out of work to do on the house. Once winter rolls through and the cold batters the woodwork, they know they’ll once again find themselves fighting a battle of constant maintenance. But for now, they can rest on the balcony and watch the sunset. Perry’s gun rests against the windowsill of the East bedroom and gathers dust. ",1,1758997652.0,AbbatoirOfMnemosyne,0,1.0,False

Something I started working on during the summer was to compile the average tier placements of all major/serious tier list attempts for all three Tactics games. This is the mean average of all said lists, though I had to do a little tinkering to standardise it for each game, as the number of tiers and their names were arbitrarily chosen by each maker (as you would expect), this way reducing everything to the lowest common denominator was possible. For FFT, there wasn't agreement on whether the OG version or the WotL remake should be chosen and whether to rank unique classes alongside generics. FFTA tiers mostly skipped unique classes, as they were entirely locked to the postgame. FFTA2 tier lists generally featured the unique classes, even though these varied in availability. 

It's mainly YouTube that proved most fruitful in offering serious efforts in tiering all the classes in the three games, with an exception made for a post on Reddit and a series of comments (!) on a popular YouTube video that rivalled the upload in insight and care.   
  
For reference, here are the sources data was drawn from for the compilation tier list in question:

So we’ve been friends for the better part of a year, and about 3 months ago, she got tipsy, she said she was starting to like me as more than a friend. So we kissed, i know she was tipsy, so I didn’t read a lot into it. She just got out of her crappy marriage, so I know that is a factor also. So I understand she needs time, and this isn’t the time for a full blown relationship.

We kissed again when she wasn’t tipsy, so know there is something. We talk every day.  She says that she tells me her deepest secrets, admits that she has plenty of male attention. But I’m the male friend she is closest to. 

We hang out, 2-3 times a week also. It’s just odd because we have these intimate moments. Couple days ago, she’s told me she loves me, and that she misses me. But we both know we’re not exclusive. 

A couple days ago we were hanging out, she was lying on the floor, and reached her hand out and I grabbed it and asked “you need help getting up?” And she was like “no, I just wanted to hold your hand for a minute” 
Which ended the night with this 15min long intimate hug where we held one another. 
She will go from that to like it never happened. 

She will go from talking sexually with me to flipping a switch and being like “hi friend” sometimes she calls me “boo” etc. she will tell me she tells all her acquaintances about me and everyone knows about me. But we’ve also said “anything good takes time” etc, it’s very back and forth. 

We went from spending weekends together, to know she spends time with me during the week a lot, but not so much on weekends. 

I’m not tripping out about any of it, we aren’t exclusive, I understand the “back and forth” is part of her personality. And she’s told me she backs off because she doesn’t want to rush in get overwhelmed and ghost me. Which is also fair. 

She has gone out of her way before work to meet me at the gym and bring me coffee before work and tell me “I don’t bring coffee to anyone, especially guys” she’s gotten me pants and a pair of shoes when we were running late for a concert. 

So it’s really the conflicting energy I am wondering about.

To be honest, I just wanted to know if I’m being played with all the “extra stuff” she says and does. Because I’m perfectly fine with friendship, I just don’t want to feel stupid after the fact.

""Keith O'Donnell, head geneticist at the New Organism Vitality & Advancement genetics company. They want me logging from day one, so here’s day one.

The air down here smells like oil and rust. We’re beneath an abandoned NORAD-adjacent facility, built in the fifties, decommissioned in the eighties, and repurposed for NOVA Genetics in the nineties. Gotta love recycling.

What we’ve found—or what NOVA claims we’ve found—makes the discovery of the atom look like a waste of time. 

They call it Syberium — a viscous, violet liquid, drawn from the Chersky Range four years ago.

After examination, it yielded potential benefits for the subjects. Proceeding 14 tests, the conclusive answer is that Syberium acts as a growth accelerant and is extremely potent; as of now, only 20 CC is needed for complete growth. But...again, none of the subjects have made it out of the newborn stage,(sigh) all dying from rapid cellular decay.

I fear the Syberium itself is missing to endure the constant strain of duplicating molecules. We'd need a stabilizer of some sort.""

He stood with his back to me, hands clasped behind him. Same suit, same inner fear. When his voice came it wasn't speaking. It was a whisper that felt like it landed directly in my inner ear. Like a demon making me surrender to his wicked whims.

The scent shifted every few seconds, until it returned to a soft fire licked marshmallow aroma, all those flavors seeping of nostalgia, the man then sipped the cup gently.

I noticed when his lips parted the drink, his tongue was partly purple as though stained by a food. He proceeded to sit down on the chair rolling it to the start of the desk, depositing his cup on a coaster.""

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Phillies vs. Twins: A Tale of Two Teams, One Overwhelming Favorite**  
*By Your Humble Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Believe the Twins Exist*

The Philadelphia Phillies (-204) are about to face the Minnesota Twins (+168) in a matchup so lopsided it makes a teeter-totter after a toddler hops on one side. Let’s break this down with the precision of a MLB umpire and the humor of a beer-soaked bar bet.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Phillies Are Basically Already Celebrating

The Phillies’ implied probability of winning this game is **67%** (thanks to those -204 odds), while the Twins hover at a laughable **37%**. To put that in perspective, the Twins’ chances of winning are about the same as me remembering to wear pants to work on a Zoom day.

Statistically, the Phillies are a juggernaut:

* **Offense**: 8th in MLB in runs (4.9/g) and home runs (1.3/g). Bryce Harper’s slugging percentage (.493) could double as a blueprint for a demolition crew.
* **Pitching**: A 3.83 ERA and 9.1 strikeouts per nine innings? Ranger Suarez (3.12 ERA, 12-7 record) isn’t just a pitcher—he’s a human strikeout machine with a side of “meh” against the Twins.
* **Moneyline Magic**: The Phillies are 22-5 when the odds are -204 or shorter this season. That’s the sports betting equivalent of a “layup” in basketball: easy, inevitable, and slightly insulting to bet against.

The Twins? They’re the team that trips over its own shoelaces while sprinting toward relevance. Their 4.62 ERA (25th in MLB) and .239 team batting average make them the baseball version of a group project where everyone forgets to show up. Their starter, Mick Abel (7.36 ERA), has the same chance of silencing the Phillies as I do of napping without my coffee.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Struggles, and a Side of “Why?”

The Phillies aren’t perfect—they’re missing key arms like Turner, Romano, and Alvarado—but their core remains intact. Harper, Schwarber (56 HRs, 132 RBIs), and a bullpen that’s third in strikeouts per nine innings? That’s a recipe for victory, not a grocery list.

The Twins, meanwhile, are a case study in “how not to bui

I'm a 36M who recently started taking salsa classes from scratch. It's been an amazing confidence booster.

There's a woman in the class (she is in her early 40s) who was one of the first partners kind enough to dance with me when I was a beginner. We'd chat, she'd ask personal questions (if I live alone, what I do weekends, etc.), and I developed a bit of a crush. The mixed signals had me in the ""is she/isn't she"" loop.

Last week, after a social event, I finally shot my shot and asked her out for coffee. Her response was the classic gentle let-down: she said ""how sweet"" (""tan tierno"" in Spanish, which is a soft no here), said she didn't have time, but maybe a tequila another day (vague future).

**Logically, I get it.** I'm not pursuing it further; I respect her answer and won't make it weird in class. I wasn't in love, but the attachment to the *idea* of her still stings a bit. It's more about the bruised ego and the ""what if"" fading away.

For the guys who've been there: **What's your best mental reset button?** How do you flip the switch from dwelling on the ""no"" back to focusing on your own mission? Any practical steps you take to shake off that feeling?

When I awaken in the night to go to the bathroom, not from pain, my leg has become a wooden peg leg. It doesn't really hurt until I try to walk and bend it. I get back in bed and am able to go back to sleep. 

But come morning, I go to the restroom, take other meds not related to TKR, then crawl back in bed to do some ankle pumps and watch the morning news. The peg leg remains until I get up and have breakfast and coffee, then warm up with ankle slides and stretches on a step. I'm warned up a bit until I sit and watch TV for 2 hours again and then my leg leg is back. Do I need to be doing something every hour? May I use heat now?
