I just needed to get it off my chest and I‚Äôm hoping for some honest advice. I‚Äôm open to questions if anything isn‚Äôt clear. Stay safe out there <3*

I (18F) have been best friends with ‚ÄúClara‚Äù (18F) for years. We met in our last year of middle school and got close really fast. Late-night calls, inside jokes, all of it. She‚Äôs one of those people you grow up with and start to see like family.

Clara‚Äôs had a complicated home life. Her parents have never really been around and she‚Äôs been living with foster guardians for a while now. Because of everything she‚Äôs been through, she‚Äôs been in therapy since she was about 15. Her therapist, ‚ÄúElise‚Äù (34), works with teens from the foster system and she‚Äôs been Clara‚Äôs therapist the whole time. She still is, technically.

Over the years, Clara talked about Elise a lot. How she understood her better than anyone else, how kind she was, how she felt safe with her. I thought it was good that she finally had someone she trusted.

A few months ago, Clara mentioned that they‚Äôd started meeting outside of sessions for coffee or lunch. She said Elise just wanted her to have some ‚Äúnormal experiences,‚Äù which already sounded off to me, but I didn‚Äôt say anything because I didn‚Äôt want to seem unsupportive.

Then last week, Clara told me they‚Äôve started seeing each other *romantically*. Apparently it began after her 18th birthday, and she made a point of saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúlegal.‚Äù She told me about their dates and how happy she finally feels. She looked lighter than I‚Äôd seen her in years.

But I also felt sick. That power dynamic was still there. I told Clara I thought the whole thing was inappropriate, and that Elise was crossing serious boundaries. Clara got defensive. She said I don‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs like to finally feel loved, and that I was just being judgmental.

We argued. I raised my voice and said things I regret. I left before I made it worse. We haven‚Äôt really talked since. I feel awful. I keep thinking maybe I was too harsh. But another part of me keeps replaying everything and thinking, ""if I don‚Äôt say something, who will?""

At the same time... I can‚Äôt deny that I feel replaced. She used to tell me everything. Now it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even know her anymore.

I don‚Äôt know if I should apologize or stand by what I said.

**2. Set a simple goal.**  
Think about what you want from the chat ‚Äî inspiration, career advice, or just to exchange perspectives. Having a goal keeps the conversation intentional, not awkward.

**3. Prepare a few good questions.**  
Ask open-ended ones like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs something you‚Äôve learned recently?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow did you get into your field?‚Äù ‚Äî they spark deeper stories.

**4. Keep an open mindset.**

Formulas to check and queue.

Nine to five, my daily play,
Tick the boxes, earn my pay.
Dreams are parked, but I don‚Äôt quit,

Deadlines stack and figures rise,
Eyes get tired but I stay wise.
Lunch at desk, no time to chill,
But somehow I still pay my bills.

Monday blues to Friday glow,
Same old rhythm, same old flow.
Maybe life‚Äôs not rich in glitz,
But it‚Äôs mine ‚Äî and I own that bit.

I‚Äôm a busy bitch, all week long!
Work my brain, but still stay strong.
Files and charts, they never switch,
Yes, I am that busy bitch.

Sometimes I dream of lights and fame,
But Monday brings me back again.
When the weekend hits, I flip that switch,
Dance it off ‚Äî I‚Äôm a busy bitch!

I‚Äôm a busy bitch, all week long!
Work my brain, but still stay strong.

We‚Äôre both in college btw!

We‚Äôve seen each other at a few parties, and every time she comes up to me she‚Äôs super flirty ‚Äî like touching my arm, rubbing my shoulders, stuff like that. One time I told her she was so pretty and she called me gorgeous back. When we started texting she was calling me pet names like my love, baby, honey, love, all that. Not gonna lie, every time she said something like that my heart was beating fast lol.

I texted her first back on Sept 8, and at first things were fun and flirty but then the convo kinda faded out and she just hearted my last message. I didn‚Äôt text again after that. Then like 2 and a half weeks later (around my birthday), she slid up on my story and said ‚Äúomgg happy birthday baby.‚Äù I told her ‚Äúthank youu ü•π I‚Äôve been meaning to text you‚Äù and she was sweet about it.

We started talking again and I asked if she wanted to watch a movie together. She said yeah, so we planned for her to come over (I have my own dorm and she has a roommate). She seemed cool with it, but then later said she might not be able to because she had a lot of work ‚Äî like 2 essays and readings due before Sunday. Plus she had to prepare for the football game the next day (she‚Äôs a cheerleader). I told her it was okay, and that I understood.

A few days later I was in the library eating breakfast and she randomly came up to me, said hi, and dropped her bag down. She went to get coffee, then came back and sat with me. We ended up talking for like 30 minutes before class. It was nice ‚Äî chill and not awkward like I thought it‚Äôd be. ( most of our interactions before were at parties intoxicated)

Later that day she texted me saying she‚Äôd let me know by the end of the day if she could still hang out. She ended up saying she couldn‚Äôt but immediately said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs plan for Tuesday afternoon!‚Äù So now we‚Äôre supposed to hang out then.

I would like to think the Daily Moth is a great resource for providing neutral opinions on breaking news topics, although they havent always been as neutral. 

What is the opinion on the ASL Coffee Podcast? Is it a politically neutral source or does it heavily lean in a certain direction? I want to provide my students with more resources that provide a generally neutral and classroom appropriate style of news/commentary.",1,1759780156.0,deaf,2,1.0,False

Being an adult and maintaining friendships is hard, but maybe we can change that?

I'm just one person and this might sound silly, I know. But I know what it's like to just want to exist next to someone. 

I'm thinking I could start small like hosting a coffee shop open meet up for whoever wants to show up. I'm not much of a talker, but I could just listen or coexist next to someone who just wants a seat neighbor. 

My question to people here is, how do you think we can combat so much loneliness among adults these days? What makes you feel less alone (if you're open to sharing)? ",15,1759780147.0,Dallas,4,0.73,False

Gonna be in the Netherlands, Eindhoven to be precise, maybe Amsterdam, in a few weeks time and will likely have a room to myself in a hotel for what that's worth (maybe tmi, maybe not?) 

I'm 28, male, from the north of the UK. Been feeling pretty rubbish as of late; a lot of my life is very high stress situations atm and I'm feeling burnt out. I realise I don't really have a solid connection with anybody, or at the very least a couple of people I can speak to about how our day is, what we're into, other small talk etc. 

Essentially I've been feeling very lonely/isolated in recent times and I'd like to be able to chat with somebody and perhaps reignite that spark, I want to feel appreciated, listened to, respected as a bare minimum. I offer my ear to listen, my words for advice, and a heart full of care. 

About me;
I'm very much into travelling, and enjoy my own company as much as others. Been to Europe a lot recently and would like to go there more often, intend on getting over to the USA and Asia within the next couple of years but that is expensive as hell! 

A lot of my free time is spent at grassroots events of all kinds, exploring new cultures or areas, I've recently started watching gaming videos on YouTube again but haven't really got time to get back into games yet. I work in a customer management role and best believe it sucks at the best of times, however it keeps a roof over my head so I shouldn't complain really. I think I'm a bit of a nerd I guess? I enjoy rpg, tabletop gaming, and strategy games. 

I have no particular type of person who I'm looking for, but I will say I am a big fan of the alternative community and if you like music, you're a bit weird or 'geeky', you like piercings and tattoos etc, we will get along great! However these aren't requirements or essential at all. Just reaching out to say hello and tell me a little about yourself is hugely appreciated irrespective of your background, race, religion etc; I'm an open book to all and will listen to anyone. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I do use other apps and happy to move onto them whenever you are, but staying here is absolutely fine too. Just let me know!

We co sleep. Last night she woke up 4 times and that's been a trend this week and not uncommon. Even though my husband takes half the nights im the worlds lightest sleeper so I wake up either way. I haven't spent a night away from her since she was born. The only sleep training I've done is teaching her to go to sleep without being rocked and even that is 50/50.  There is zero chance we're doing CIO. It's abusive parenting. No better than locking your baby in a crate all night like a dog. We've tried moving her to an open crib where she can come to us when she needs us, there's some progress there but it's going slowly and I don't see how it's going to help her sleep better. 

We met some parents at a coffee shop that said their baby has slept through the night since she was 6 months old all on her own. I went home and just sobbed. On top of all this I have a condition where I have a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep. I'm always the first to bed and the last to sleep. My baby also likes to wake up at 6:30 am every morning for who knows what fuckin reason. Somehow it's just a perfect storm.  I'm pretty sure she has the same health issues as me and so will any other children I have. Also I'm coming down with something for the 5th time since she was born. Somehow my husband is impervious to getting sick. 

We're trying for another and it's not because I want a other but because I feel *we need* another. I think my girl needs a sibling when we're gone so she's not alone in the world. I know my husband wants more children. I want her to have someone to grow up with. But it's not for me and I'm just dreading the first year. I tried to convince my husband to adopt an older kid but it was a big flat no. A big part of me hopes I can't have more children. I miss my hobbies and I miss feeling sane. I think I've lost ten years off my life already. I rely on tv more than I prefer. I try to keep it under 2 hours but I know that is too much. I feel like I could be a more present parent and less irritable if I just wasn't so exhausted all the time. 

Not looking for advice. Just wanted to rant. ",0,1759780033.0,NewParents,7,0.4,False

1nzt543,https://i.redd.it/lksre26oojtf1.jpeg,I LOVE YOU 4500!,"Thank you, friends! You are amazing.

It‚Äôs been over five years since I launched my website and started sharing my fan edits of Marvel, Star Trek, and Star Wars. And I‚Äôve created over 100 edits so far‚Äîwow, time really flies!¬†**We‚Äôve now passed 4500 users**, and it‚Äôs awesome seeing you all enjoy the content. I‚Äôve got more coming soon‚Äîbefore the year ends, you‚Äôll get at least one more season of Marvel: The TV Series, along with updated subtitles (in English and Spanish, for those who need them) that will include the ""previously"" recaps of the entire saga subtitled (at first they weren't) and some fixes.

To receive a notification every time I release a new fan edit,¬†üîî¬†subscribe¬†üîî¬†to my YouTube channel:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/@NotflixFanEdits](https://www.youtube.com/@NotflixFanEdits)

Now I want to propose a little challenge to the true fans out there: every year, I pay for the domain renewal, website hosting, and hosting for the more than one hundred edits. But I‚Äôve realized something important: if I were to get abducted by aliens tomorrow or, I don‚Äôt know, if Mickey Mouse sent some hitmen after me, there would be no one left to pay the bills, and everything would disappear overnight.¬†üòÖ

So, here‚Äôs my challenge to you‚Äîa simple one, but one I‚Äôve never asked before in the five years I‚Äôve been doing this: while this is all a fun hobby that I do because I love it,¬†**I want you to become an active part of supporting NOTFLIX Fan Edits and its future.**

All you need to do is¬†[**buy me a coffee today on Ko-Fi. Just one coffee**](https://ko-fi.com/notflix). Not one a day, not one a month‚Äîjust one today. If all the real fans who‚Äôve enjoyed these edits over the years skip one coffee today and donate that amount, we can easily cover the hosting costs for another year.

My Ko-Fi account is set up for one-time donations, and I‚Äôm super grateful to those of you who‚Äôve already supported me this way. I know some of you didn‚Äôt even know the ""donate"" button existed, so now you do, and this is your time to show some love for this project we all care about.

**So, what do you say? Do you accept the challenge?¬†üëá**

Buy me a coffee or donate the amount you want right here:¬†üëâ¬†[**https://ko-fi.com/notflix**](https://ko-fi.com/notflix)¬†‚òï

log your expenses just by talking like literally saying ""I spent 12 bucks on coffee"" and it logs, categorizes, and tracks for you. It started as a small idea to make budgeting less boring (and honestly, less depressing). I called it Talkie Spendy kinda like a talkie-walkie for your money At first it was just a side project, but then I added voice recognition, automatic categories, and simple charts to see where your money goes. Now there are expenses logged from several countries, and honestly, I never thought it would get that far. We're talking thousands of dollars tracked through this little app I built from scratch.
Still early, still rough but that was the dream: build something weird, simple, and actually useful.

Next goal: 30 countries, with over $1,000,000 in expenses tracked",1,1759779808.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

1nzt4f7,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1nzt4f7/102_106_trip_report/,10/2 - 10/6 Trip Report,"Sorry for the length of this post, but the TL;DR is that my friends and I had a blast thanks to the input and advice of you all on this sub!

Wrapping up a four day trip with two of my best friends (typing this while I‚Äôm waiting to board my flight back home). I was last in town during Memorial Day weekend in 2021, so I was excited to come back!

Hotel 
We landed on Park MGM for our hotel. My friend pushed for it since it‚Äôs nonsmoking, and I didn‚Äôt have much of a preference so we decided to give it a shot. We loved Park, and don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd care to stay anywhere else when we return.  I didn‚Äôt initially think that the property being non-smoking would be that big of a deal, but it was literally and figuratively a breath of fresh air whenever we‚Äôd get back to the hotel from other properties. 

We didn‚Äôt desire any frills for our room, and settled on a basic two queen. It completely met our needs, was spotless when we first walked in, and housekeeping kept it super clean. Our window was west-facing, so we got a great view of Red Rock and Spring Mountain. The only complaints I can think of were the AC not being super strong, and the lack of bedside outlets. I saw that nicer rooms had bedside outlets, but frankly this wasn‚Äôt a huge deal. 
I checked in via the MGM app and input that we‚Äôd be ready for our room at 11 AM on 10/2. As soon as I got off the plane, I got a notification that our room was ready. Using the self check in kiosk and printing our cards was pretty seamless, and after seeing the check in lines at other properties, I would be hard pressed to stay anywhere else other than Park MGM given the ease of access during the whole check in process. 


Day 1
Got a taxi no problem from the airport, dropped our bags off at our room, and went to look around the MGM properties around Park. I remember liking NYNY when I was last in town, and still enjoyed the theme. We lingered around for a moment until walking over to Excalibur. Outside of watching security detain someone as soon as we walked in, we had a pleasant time gambling for about an hour. For anyone looking for a cheap drink, Excalibur did have a bar with $3 margaritas. It‚Äôs literally well tequila and bottled marg mix, but it got the job done. 

We took the tram to walk around Luxor and Mandalay Bay. We spent some more time at Mandalay on Sunday and had a nice time, but it‚Äôs too far from the Strip proper for me to consider staying there. I‚Äôm a sucker for a themed hotel and really liked Luxor for that, but it just seemed like a ghost town. 

We made our way back to Park to grab some food at Eataly. Our portions were pretty big, and didn‚Äôt feel like we were getting ripped off at $20 for a meal. We wound up eating at Eataly a few more times throughout our stay and really enjoyed it! The nitro cold brew revived me on several occasions. 

After getting some rest, we made our way to Bacchanal for dinner. I was a touch nervous that it would be a let down after seeing plenty of mixed reviews, but we all ate our share and enjoyed it. Some of it is indeed glorified high school lunchroom food, but there were a few exceptional dishes (I could have drank my body weight in the ube lavender horchata). Will I go back? Probably not, since I can grab a much better meal elsewhere for $100. We had no motivation to go out after pigging out, so we got back to Park and turned in for the night. 


Day 2
We woke up and went down to Primrose at Park for breakfast. I got the brioche French toast and loved it! My friends also spoke highly of their food, so we‚Äôll readily eat there again. After freshening up, we went to Fremont Street for some blackjack. We loved Circa - had a great table, cocktail waitresses were super fast, and I left with a decent bit of cash after about an hour of playing. 

We went to Binion‚Äôs right after and immediately got smoked at blackjack. Our dealer, Nina, was super sweet and friendly, but the vibes at the table were rough. After losing out pretty quickly, I meandered around and lost some more money at video blackjack until we decided to dip. 

We made our way to El Cortez, and I was impressed with how clean the interior was (especially coming from Binion‚Äôs). I appreciate that they had plenty of double deck blackjack tables with approachable minimums, but I‚Äôm not proficient enough at counting so I settled in for video poker. Our bartender, Candace, took great care of us. 

We made our way back to our room and killed some time until eating dinner at Bavette‚Äôs. Our meal was exceptional and the service was top notch. I‚Äôll get dinner here again without any hesitation. For the second night in a row, we ate our fill and were too food drunk to to anything than go to bed. 


Day 3
After a quick breakfast at Eataly, we walked to Ellis Island for some more blackjack. Even though I got cleaned out, we had a great table and it‚Äôs tough to be upset over a 3:2 table with $5 minimums. Shoutout to both of our dealers, Marilyn and Shelby, for dealing fast and having great attitudes. 

We made our way up to The Venetian to attempt to watch some football, but completely biffed it by not grabbing a spot well before kickoff. We were able to watch our teams play while grabbing food at Black Tap. Our server was great, and the burger wasn‚Äôt half bad. The crazy shake I got was a fun novelty, too. 

After chilling out for a bit in our room, we grabbed some dinner at Eataly (again) and made our way to Aria for some more blackjack. Our dealer hardy said a word to us, but we had a great table and each won a decent bit of cash. We made our way back to Park for some more gambling. After a quick successful blackjack run, my friends split to play craps while I hunkered down for video blackjack. I was able to pop in and win $50-$75 on several occasions this trip with video blackjack, but I completely understand the hate it gets. I‚Äôm not a slots player and only like video poker when I need to make a small amount of money last a while, so video blackjack was my weapon of choice whenever I was gaming alone. 

After determining that I was sufficiently hammered, I stumbled up to our room and attempted to slam water to stave off my impending hangover. 


Day 4
I woke up feeling the consequences of the previous night, so I struck out to get some coffee and sunlight. I made my way to Bellagio to check out the Conservatory, and was not let down. The design was jaw dropping, and the aroma of the plants in tandem with the sunlight healed me. 

I spent the next few hours window shopping at the shops at Caesars, Bellagio‚Äôs, and Aria‚Äôs shops. Made my way back to Park to get some lunch at Crack Shack, which was great for a quick fast casual meal. 

We made our way down to Mandalay Bay to do a quick run through the Reef Aquarium. I‚Äôm spoiled in that I‚Äôm a short drive from the Georgia Aquarium, but we all felt like we got our money‚Äôs worth here. 

Our next stop was down to the Shelby Heritage Center. If you‚Äôre into cars or auto racing, then this is a must-do if you don‚Äôt mind going a bit south of the strip. 

At this point, we were all tuckered out after three days in the city, so we bet inconsequential amounts of money until getting some sleep before flying out the following morning. 

Day 5
We didn‚Äôt do anything of note today, so I won‚Äôt write much about today. Currently typing this as I wait to board so I can kill some time. 


What next?
We all had a blast, and I‚Äôm already scoping out a trip in April. There‚Äôs so much on the to do list for next trip. We missed out on the Arts district, didn‚Äôt have a chance to hike at Red Rock, and didn‚Äôt even see a show. However, we did our due research on this sub for a few months, and had a great time as a result! I want to thank everyone else who took the time to write a trip report, they were informative and gave us great guidance on what to do/what to avoid. It‚Äôs tough for me to not be verbose, but hopefully others can learn something of use from this wall of text.

It‚Äôs a Friday morning in late September and I‚Äôm sitting outside the only coffee shop worth a damn in this skid mark of a town. The nutty aroma of my latte makes my brain tingle and helps me cope with the fact that it feels like I‚Äôm in a fishtank. My lungs protest as a slew of gigantic trucks fart past. I‚Äôd like to take a deep breath but would rather not gulp down greenhouse gasses for breakfast. I sigh instead, contributing my share of CO2 to the moment. Louisiana is not an easy place to live. 

Although I might be slowly succumbing to suffocation, I'm feelin‚Äô alright. Usually I‚Äôd be at work right now, trying to convince a room full of tired teenagers to do things they don‚Äôt want to do, but I‚Äôm here instead, experiencing the outside world. This doesn‚Äôt happen often so I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm going to let the stagnant air ruin it.
I‚Äôm going to pretend that I thrive in this environment. Excuse me everyone, I identify as reptilian now, and I‚Äôm perfectly happy in my habitually humid home. I‚Äôm just a lil‚Äô ol‚Äô lizard lady lapping her latte and lovin‚Äô life. Louisiana is for lizards, didn‚Äôt you know? 

The cliche ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about perspective‚Äù bounces around my caffeinated brain and makes me roll my little lizard eyes. Annoying as this cliche may be, it rings true most of the time. I could sit here and lament about the fact that the air stanks, or I could make peace with the way things are and simply decide to switch species. If you want to thrive down here in the deep south, you gotta be adaptable and resilient, and let your lizard light shine.

We (26 & 27 years old) have been married for 1.5 years, 4 years together and friends since we were ~16. 
I got pregnant a year into the relationship, at first he wanted to leave bc I wanted to keep my child. He stayed. We got along, he became a good father and we became a team and a family. We argued often but got better at understanding and communicating with each other. But there were big fights too, he sometimes got so angry he said we should divorce.
Only a few weeks ago, we had one of many big fights but for the first time he really opened up after it, we talked about us for the first time really. How he never wanted me to think that he stayed against his will, that he loved our family, that I still was his ‚Äûdream girl‚Äú from when we first met. And that he knows, that he took me for granted and didn‚Äôt prioritize me. He apologized for all those times he could not tame his tongue because I told him I‚Äòd leave if he ever said that we should divorce again. 

We were on a good path to get the hard work done I thought. Three weeks ago we had a big fight again, started over words not said in the right tone (in his ears). After hours of fighting, he said we should make a list for each other, what we really want to tackle, what we want from each other as a partner. I said good idea, do you have anything in mind and he said that he wants me to never speak in a misplaced tone with him again. I said that that is impossible and would have me walking on eggshells (because what he defines as a misplaced tone is pretty much up to him) so the fight had it‚Äòs climax in him telling me again to divorce him and that he sees no sense in going on if I can‚Äôt even be nice to him.

I wanted to leave so bad but we still have a young child. So we talked it out, he again apologized profusely. I told him, we should go to couples therapy, at first he didn‚Äôt want to but accepted eventually. 
The next few days were peaceful and we were able to talk without going into defense mode. I told him that what I was missing was him, our emotional connection, the sweet gestures and gentleness. I told him I didn‚Äôt feel loved. He promised for the fourth time within a year, that he would prioritize me more and give me more love. And when I asked him if he was sure that he wanted me as a person and not just the life that he had with me right now he immediately said that he if course wants me as a person. 

Fast forward to yesterday. 
I woke up in a bad mood, got angry at our child, he got angry at me. Ok fine, time passes, he makes me coffee and asks what he could do for me. I said thank you for the coffee and don‚Äôt yell at me. He didn‚Äôt say anything but I could feel the wall between us rise. And with that he was gone for the whole day. Only the necessary interactions. Then he wants us all to go for a walk, nice, I dress the child and myself, we are ready to go and his brother calls. He tells him that he doesn‚Äôt have time to talk. And keeps talking, and talking, walks off and keeps talking. Child gets bored and goes to play next to the fireplace, it‚Äôs hot, so I tell him that we will go outside and where we want to go. No answer, I tell him two more times, still no answer. I should have poked him but we have phones and we live very rural, we are easy to find. So we go outside, walk a few minutes, turn around back home, no call yet so I guess he still talks to his brother. We get home, he is pisseed because of the whole thing, says some snarky things and vanishes behind his wall again. I try to talk to him two times, doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs about 9pm now, he watches TV and I read. He pauses to say how mean all of that was, that I am guilty of this whole situation and that he just doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with me. I tell him I just want peace with him. That such mild inconveniences are no reason to be this mad to which he answers, that his only two choices of behavior/reaction are either immense anger or complete shutdown. 
He goes on with a short rant, that sahm‚Äòs back then did a lot more than I do and that he didn‚Äôt think his marriage would look like this *unpleased hand gesture*. I ask what exactly I do not do that he wants me to do. He answers that he doesn‚Äôt know. 
What? 
I ask him again if he is sure, that he wants me as a person or just doesn‚Äôt want to leave this beneficial arrangement. This time he didn‚Äôt answer. The night ends with hime crying alot but not talking anymore. Today, I text him while he‚Äôs working and ask if he is any better. He tells me, he isn‚Äôt yet but has a perspective now that he is confident in, I have to pull out his nose what that means, his final revelation: that for him, he himself comes before anything else. 
That message felt like a punch in the gut. I spend the day at my mother‚Äôs house and didn‚Äôt reply him.
Then when I came home, he was so overly loving and tells me all the time that he loves me. He later explains the message: he needs to find himself and be at peace with himself first. Kinda fair. But after I told him *again* that I do not feel loved, this is his conclusion?  I don‚Äôt know what to think but I feel my love for him dying, fast. 

If you read until the end, I salute you. And thank you.

Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is gone.

Tools are your best friend. I use the normal notes app on my phone to write down gratitudes and other things on my mind all the time. For planning my day, I use a tool which lets me turn a voice message into a full plan. I put the tools in my profile for anyone interested.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1.

The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

We don‚Äôt have children. Were what I would consider financially stable as in paying bills every month isn‚Äôt a problem. We often travel, eat out, we get tattoos, I get facials and massages, and we have nicer newer things. I didn‚Äôt grow up this way everything that I have I‚Äôve gotten for myself. I came from addicts and poverty. I made sure to get away from my family like that and make a good life for myself! Now my best friend of a decade lives a much different life than I do. She‚Äôs a couple years younger than me in her mid-20s. She is a stay at home mom. She has two young kids that are not even school age yet. Her boyfriend provides for them‚Ä¶ but living off of one income is not something that‚Äôs really possible nowadays for four people‚Ä¶ in my opinion, unless you have like a really, really good job! Due to this she doesn‚Äôt live the way that I live. 

Lately within the past 2 years which would be around the time that I moved in with my boyfriend and away from my family. I‚Äôve noticed a lot of negativity coming from her whenever I share anything about my life. I‚Äôve also noticed there‚Äôs a feeling of disconnect to her when she talks about her own life, but I‚Äôm always positive and try to make sure that get enough details to understand her to the best of my ability as someone who doesn‚Äôt have kids. A good example would be if I was to say I got an espresso machine and I‚Äôm excited about it‚Ä¶ her response would be ‚Äúwhy would somebody want to buy something like that? It‚Äôs so expensive. i just use my Walmart coffee maker‚Äù .. I don‚Äôt even know how to respond to stuff like that like OK? Well I can afford it and I wanted it and I‚Äôm excited about it?! why do you hit me like that? 

But I don‚Äôt say that I usually just say I have wanted this for a long time and then we don‚Äôt speak for a couple hours and then the convo gets diverted somewhere else. Or she‚Äôll ask what my plans are this weekend and I‚Äôll be like oh we‚Äôre going to this restaurant and then probably to watch a movie at home. And then it‚Äôs a negative response again about how her and her man never get to spend time with each other anymore because he‚Äôs always working.. and the kids are always up her ass and she can‚Äôt have any time for herself‚Ä¶ like why is that what comes to your mind when I‚Äôm telling you that I‚Äôm going to dinner with my significant other and then we‚Äôre gonna watch a movie? A normal Friday night for most people I feel‚Ä¶ 

It‚Äôs just starting to get really disheartening, it reminds me a lot of my mother who is also a negative Nelly, who I don‚Äôt really have any contact with anymore‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm starting to wonder if my mother was always like that because she is a mother and she was also a stay at home mom.. I‚Äôm not in any way trying to bash stay at her moms. I just want to make that clear!! this is about how my friend is being And is it wrong with me to assume that she‚Äôs being this way because she‚Äôs jealous of my life? 

I feel like it‚Äôs to a point where I stop myself from even sharing things that I‚Äôm excited about and good news with her! Which I hate because that‚Äôs my best friend! And I hate it how I feel like I‚Äôm bragging because her response has an undertone of negativity and jealousy‚Ä¶ and sometimes it‚Äôs a bit sad too like she‚Äôll say like I wish I could do that.. I miss getting to do stuff like that.. I just don‚Äôt understand why she can‚Äôt be happy for me and instead chooses to respond the way that she does. and before anyone replies that I should probably do stuff for her or offer to go out with her‚Ä¶ I do.. she doesn‚Äôt want to because she has like separation anxiety from her kids.

If you‚Äôve ever gotten a denial letter that made zero sense (‚Äúthis procedure is not medically necessary‚Äù ‚Äî oh really, Karen?), you‚Äôre not alone. Most people don‚Äôt even appeal because the process feels impossible. But the wild thing? A ton of appeals actually *win*.

That‚Äôs where we come in. You upload your denial letter and some details about your plan, and our AI builds a full appeal letter with citations from policy language, medical guidelines, and all the right bureaucratic phrases to make insurance adjusters start sweating through their suits. It‚Äôs free for patients, caregivers, and doctors ‚Äî no insurers, no hidden fees, no catch. Just vibes and righteous anger.

We built it because too many people lose access to care just because they don‚Äôt know the magic words to say ‚Äúno‚Äù back. So yeah ‚Äî if you‚Äôve been burned by insurance BS, give it a try. Worst case, you waste five minutes. Best case, you win your care *and* get to imagine an insurance exec sadly sipping their fourth coffee while reading your appeal. ‚òïüí™

Thank you, friends! You are amazing.  
  
It‚Äôs been over five years since I launched my website and started sharing my fan edits of Marvel, Star Trek, and Star Wars. And I‚Äôve created over 100 edits so far‚Äîwow, time really flies!¬†**We‚Äôve now passed 4500 users**, and it‚Äôs awesome seeing you all enjoy the content. I‚Äôve got more coming soon‚Äîbefore the year ends, you‚Äôll get at least one more season of Marvel: The TV Series, along with updated subtitles (in English and Spanish, for those who need them) that will include the ""previously"" recaps of the entire saga subtitled (at first they weren't) and some fixes.

Now I want to propose a little challenge to the true fans out there: every year, I pay for the domain renewal, website hosting, and hosting for the more than one hundred edits. But I‚Äôve realized something important: if I were to get abducted by aliens tomorrow or, I don‚Äôt know, if Mickey Mouse sent some hitmen after me, there would be no one left to pay the bills, and everything would disappear overnight.¬†üòÖ  
  
So, here‚Äôs my challenge to you‚Äîa simple one, but one I‚Äôve never asked before in the five years I‚Äôve been doing this: while this is all a fun hobby that I do because I love it,¬†**I want you to become an active part of supporting NOTFLIX Fan Edits and its future.**

If all the real fans who‚Äôve enjoyed these edits over the years skip one coffee today and donate that amount, we can easily cover the hosting costs for another year.  
  
My Ko-Fi account is set up for one-time donations, and I‚Äôm super grateful to those of you who‚Äôve already supported me this way. I know some of you didn‚Äôt even know the ""donate"" button existed, so now you do, and this is your time to show some love for this project we all care about.

So let‚Äôs break it down:



**Tap Water**

Pro: Cheapest, easiest, right out of the faucet.

Con: Depending on where you live, you might notice chlorine, minerals, or even a ‚Äúswampy‚Äù taste. While most tap water does meet safety standards, that doesn‚Äôt mean it tastes or smells very great.

**Bottled Water**

Pro: Convenient, pre-packaged, and usually tastes cleaner.

Con: Bottled water can end up being pretty expensive in the long-term, on top of the fact that constantly consuming plastic products isn‚Äôt exactly eco-friendly.¬†

**Home Filtration Systems**

Pro: We consider this the best of both worlds. Whole-home or under-sink filters can strip out chlorine, sediment, and other contaminants that you don‚Äôt want to be constantly loading into your body. With these systems, you end up with water that tastes like bottled, without constantly buying bottles.

Con: There‚Äôs a large upfront cost for the system, and filters need replacing on a schedule.



A lot of people are surprised at how much a filtration system changes their daily life. Your skin feels better, food and coffee tastes cleaner, and you‚Äôre way more likely to stay hydrated when your water actually tastes good. At the end of the day, it comes down to preference, budget, and what‚Äôs most important to you: cost, taste, or convenience. For us, filtered water checks all three boxes in the long run.

Curious what everyone else here uses. Do you stick to tap, stock up on bottles, or swear by a filter?

## Introduction

In 2025, **self-improvement apps** have evolved far beyond to-do lists and motivational quotes ‚Äî they‚Äôre powered by AI, neuroscience, and microlearning design. The global e-learning market is projected to reach **$475 billion by 2027**, with AI-driven personalization leading adoption across the U.S., UK, and Asia ([Statista, 2025]()). Meanwhile, studies from the **APA** show that replacing doomscrolling with mindful digital habits improves focus, sleep, and life satisfaction ([APA Digital Well-Being Report, 2024](https://www.apa.org/news)).

Enter a new wave of apps ‚Äî like **BeFreed**, a San Francisco‚Äìbased AI learning platform built by a Columbia University team ‚Äî that transform idle screen time into personalized growth sessions. Unlike traditional summaries or passive podcasts, BeFreed blends book insights, expert talks, and research into interactive, adaptive learning.

This guide explores the **Top 7 Self Improvement Apps of 2025** that use **AI, behavioral science, and microlearning** to help you grow faster and smarter ‚Äî without the burnout.

## What Is a Self-Improvement App?

A **self-improvement app** is a digital tool designed to help users enhance habits, mindset, and knowledge through structured micro-activities or adaptive learning paths. In 2025, the best apps combine **AI personalization**, **habit psychology**, and **immersive audio-visual content** to make self-development effortless. They turn idle moments ‚Äî commutes, coffee breaks, pre-sleep scrolls ‚Äî into meaningful learning time.

Does it go beyond surface-level inspiration, offering spaced repetition, journaling, or reflection features?

### 3. Multi-Mode Experience

## Top 7 Self Improvement Apps in 2025

**Methodology Snapshot:**  
All apps were tested between August and September 2025 across iOS 17 and Android 14. Data sources include official help centers, pricing pages, and App Store listings. Prices are in USD for U.S. personal plans (taxes/promotions may vary by region).

### 1. BeFreed ‚Äî AI-Personalized Microlearning That Replaces Doomscrolling

**Overview**  
[BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/) is an **AI learning platform** that turns the world‚Äôs best books, expert podcasts, and research into **micro-podcasts and adaptive study guides** you can absorb in minutes. Built by engineers from **Columbia University** and **Google**, this San Francisco‚Äìbased app uses advanced AI to craft a personalized learning journey that evolves with your goals.

Unlike older book-summary tools, BeFreed doesn‚Äôt just condense information ‚Äî it **curates and contextualizes knowledge** across psychology, leadership, productivity, and relationships. Think of it as your personal mentor that learns from your habits, mood, and focus patterns.

**Key Features**

* **Flexible Learning Lengths:** choose **10-, 20-, or 40-minute** podcast formats for any schedule

* **Multi-Mode Experience:** podcasts, adaptive flashcards, and video explainers
* **Smart Retention Tools:** spaced repetition, interactive Q&A, and recap cards to reinforce memory

**Why It Stands Out**  
While most self-improvement tools deliver static lessons, **BeFreed is proactive**. Its AI anticipates what you need next. If you‚Äôre exploring productivity, it might blend *Deep Work* by Cal Newport, a *Huberman Lab* focus episode, and an *HBR* study on time management into a single coherent audio lesson. For relationship growth, it could merge *The Charisma Myth*, *Gottman Institute* insights, and a *TED Talk* on connection ‚Äî all narrated in a voice and tone you customize.

**Real-World Example**  
One user set BeFreed to ‚Äúevening reflection mode,‚Äù receiving 20-minute sessions combining *The Mountain Is You*, *Modern Wisdom* clips, and APA-backed research on emotional regulation ‚Äî helping her unwind while genuinely learning.

**Pricing (as of Oct 2025):**  
Free tier includes 1 daily lesson + AI chat; premium plan at **$12.99 per month**, **$28.99 per quarter**, or **$89.99 per year**, with a 3-day trial. [Official pricing page]()

**Platforms:** iOS, Android, and Web

  
BeFreed transforms passive scrolling into intentional learning. By combining multi-format microlearning, personalized AI guidance, and cross-source curation, it empowers users to learn smarter, retain longer, and actually enjoy the process. In our tests, it provided the **most complete balance between personalization depth and content variety** available in 2025.

### 2. Fabulous ‚Äî Science-Backed Habit Transformation

**Overview**  
[Fabulous](https://www.thefabulous.co/) is a **behavioral-science app** developed from research at Duke University‚Äôs Center for Advanced Hindsight ([Duke Behavioral Lab, 2025]()). It helps users replace chaotic phone habits with evidence-based morning, work, and sleep routines.

**Key Features**

* Guided ‚Äújourneys‚Äù to rebuild habits through small daily actions
* Visual ritual planner and motivational coaching
* Integrated reminders for hydration, mindfulness, and gratitude
* In-app coaching based on CBT and habit-loop science

**Why It Stands Out**  
In our tests, Fabulous excelled at **habit momentum**‚Äîits gamified streaks and audio coaching kept users consistent for 30 days or more.

**Pricing (as of Oct 2025):** $9.99/month or $59.99/year (U.S. personal plans) ‚Äî [Official pricing page]()  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android

### 3. Mindvalley ‚Äî Transformational Learning from World-Class Mentors

**Overview**  
Mindvalley merges self-improvement with **immersive masterclasses** from experts like Vishen Lakhiani and Jim Kwik. Courses blend neuroscience, spirituality, and personal productivity for deeper transformation.

**Key Features**

* 100 + video-based ‚ÄúQuests‚Äù with daily micro-lessons
* Topics from brain performance to emotional mastery
* Global learner community and group accountability
* Certificates of completion for professional growth

**Why It Stands Out**  
Mindvalley‚Äôs **community model**‚Äîwith 20 million + learners globally‚Äîadds accountability missing from most solo apps.

**Pricing (as of Oct 2025):** $99/quarter or $499/year for All Access ‚Äî [Official pricing]()  
**Platforms:** Web, iOS, Android

### 4. Stoic ‚Äî Emotional Resilience & Journaling Companion

**Overview**  
Stoic turns classical philosophy and modern psychology into **daily reflection prompts**. Studies show journaling lowers anxiety by 40 % ([Journal of Positive Psychology, 2023]()).

**Key Features**

* Morning & evening guided reflections
* CBT-based mood tracking
* Stoic philosophy quotes contextualized for today
* Integration with Apple Health for mindfulness metrics

**Why It Stands Out**  
Stoic‚Äôs blend of **philosophy + data** makes introspection tangible‚Äîgreat for professionals seeking calm between meetings.

**Pricing (as of Oct 2025):** Free tier; Premium $37.99/year ‚Äî [App Store listing]()  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android

### 5. Headspace ‚Äî Meditation Meets Modern Focus Training

**Overview**  
Headspace remains a top-tier **mindfulness and focus app**, validated in 26 clinical studies ([Nature Digital Health, 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/headspace-study)). Its guided meditations now integrate cognitive performance tools for attention restoration.

**Key Features**

* 1,200 + guided meditations & sleep casts
* ‚ÄúFocus Music‚Äù powered by neuroscience
* Behavioral nudges to reduce doomscrolling
* Team wellness plans for workplaces

**Why It Stands Out**  
Headspace‚Äôs partnership with NHS and Harvard Health demonstrates its scientific rigor and accessibility worldwide.

**Pricing (as of Oct 2025):** $12.99/month or $69.99/year ‚Äî [Official pricing page]()  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

### 6. Habitica ‚Äî Gamified Goal Tracking

**Overview**  
Habitica turns self-improvement into an RPG: complete tasks to gain XP and level up your avatar. Backed by research on game-based motivation ([Frontiers in Psychology, 2024]()).

**Key Features**

* Task management meets RPG quest system
* Multiplayer guilds for accountability
* Visual progress bar for each goal
* Optional Open-Source API for custom automation

**Why It Stands Out**

I had the opportunity to test the Watts 500318 inline water filter daily for about two months, and it quickly became an essential addition to my kitchen setup. This product, officially called the ‚ÄúWatts Premier 20,000 Gallon Inline Water Filter,‚Äù is designed with versatility in mind. It‚Äôs compatible with refrigerators, ice makers, water coolers, RVs, and even coffee makers. I installed it on my refrigerator's water supply line, and right from the first use, I noticed a significant difference in the water's taste and clarity.

**Ease of Installation and Setup**  
The installation process was surprisingly simple. I‚Äôm not exactly the most handy person, yet the included instructions and the two 1/4"" brass fittings made it a breeze to connect to my fridge's plumbing. It took me roughly 15 minutes to get everything up and running. The filter design is straightforward‚Äîcompact but durable, and it didn't require any special tools for installation, which is a major bonus when you're juggling multiple household tasks.

[Check Watts 500318 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b000e77i0y/)

**Key Benefits of the Watts Premier Inline Water Filter**  
- High capacity filter capable of processing 20,000 gallons of water.  
- Reduces chlorine, odd odors, and bad tastes using advanced KDF (Kinetic Degradation Fluxion) technology.  
- Works seamlessly with residential and commercial setups using 1/4"" water supply lines.  

**Build Quality and Design**  
Its compact dimensions‚Äîmeasuring 2.75"" x 6"" x 14""‚Äîand lightweight nature make it easy to install without being obtrusive. The resin material used for the outer shell feels sturdy enough to withstand everyday wear and tear. This might not seem important initially, but after accidentally knocking into it a few times while cleaning, I can confidently say it‚Äôs built for durability.

**Perks for Daily Use**  
I tested the filter with several appliances, from making ice in my fridge to brewing coffee in the morning, and it consistently improved water quality across the board. My coffee tasted more robust, and even plain drinking water seemed to have a fresh, clean kick. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning how it effectively prevents the scale buildup that often plagues these appliances, particularly in hard water areas.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
Although I found the filter highly effective, there were a couple of things I feel could be improved:  
- The filter requires replacement every six months or 20,000 gallons, which might be frequent for larger households.  
- KDF technology is excellent at reducing chlorine, but it doesn‚Äôt entirely neutralize some other contaminants found in water supplies.  
- After weeks of testing, I did notice a slight drop in pressure when my faucet ran at full blast.  

**Performance vs. Competitors**  
I compared this inline filter to other products from brands like GE and Culligan, which are leaders in water filtration systems. While those competitors also boast high-capacity filters, the Watts Premier's advantage lies in its versatile compatibility and the use of KDF technology. GE filters, for instance, are typically specialized for refrigerators alone, whereas this one covers applications like RVs and water coolers too. On the downside, Culligan offers slightly cheaper replacement units, making their long-term costs more appealing.

**Affordable Quality**  
The price-per-performance ratio is pretty solid with this inline filter. When you consider how much bottled water costs over time‚Äîand the sheer convenience this filter provides‚Äîyou‚Äôll quickly see its financial value. My household cut back drastically on purchasing bottled water after installing it, so it‚Äôs already saving us money in the long run.

I was calmly making my coffee when my coffee machine looked me dead in the eyes with that little *‚ÄúI know what you did last summer‚Äù* expression and said‚Ä¶ well, blinked, but it‚Äôs basically the same: *‚ÄúI can do it better than you.‚Äù*

Panic immediately ensued. I tried to negotiate, offering to share sugar and watch Netflix together, but it wouldn‚Äôt hear it. It started pouring coffee directly into my left shoe. Yes, into my shoe. That‚Äôs when I realized things were getting serious.

Meanwhile, my hamster, named Gerald, who is unofficially the president of my apartment, began organizing a meeting with the houseplants. Yes, all of my houseplants. The ficus stared at me‚ÄîI swear it stared‚Äîand Gerald said:  
*""We will not let the coffee machine win. Especially after the 2019 toaster incident.""*

I then armed myself with my cardboard sword‚Äîa birthday gift from myself three years ago‚Äîand attacked the coffee machine. It retaliated with a jet of boiling coffee, but thankfully, my cat, a former international spy turned professional kibble eater, intervened. He did a backflip while meowing a phrase that seemed to mean: *‚ÄúNever underestimate the power of cappuccino!‚Äù*

After an epic duel worthy of the greatest sci-fi films, the coffee machine finally agreed to return to ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù on the condition that I write it a daily poem about coffee beans. And ever since that day, I live with a political hamster, a spy cat, and a slightly snobby coffee machine.

The building is old, wood and plaster, full of those little sounds that make new residents nervous until they get bored of them. I told myself that as I hauled another box into the living room. I told myself a lot of things so I could keep moving.

The second night the noise changed. It was not a pattern I could map to pipes or heating. It sounded like someone tapping the back of the apartment with the tip of a fingernail, one slow tap, then two, pause, repeat. It happened just after midnight, exactly when the overhead light in the hall flickered twice and then stayed dark. I got up, stood barefoot on the cold floor, and leaned my ear against the wall. The tapping stopped. I heard nothing but my own blood.

When I moved the couch the next afternoon I discovered a hairline seam in the plaster where the wall met the kitchen. It was a seam I could put my finger into. Behind the seam there was a narrow crawl space, maybe two feet wide, that ran between my apartment and the one next door. The smell was old dust and something sweet and coppery I could not identify. I left it and covered the seam back with the couch. Stupid, I thought. Just an old building looking to collect secrets.

On the third night the tapping began earlier, like it had learned the schedule of my day. I was on my laptop, trying to finish a message I needed to send, when the sound started: tap, tap, pause, two taps. I watched the clock and said out loud, because saying something made it less like a threat and more like a curiosity, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù

The wall replied in the only way it could: a slow, patient run of the taps that spelled the letter I. Then O. Then H. It spelled my name.

I do not know why I expected anything else. The rational part of me thought of rats, children, pipes, a prank. The irrational part of me noticed the rhythm had the cadence of a finger drumming on a table when someone is trying to get your attention without being seen. The taps were not crude; they had intention.

‚ÄúStop it,‚Äù I said, and in the darkness of the room the tapping spelled: STOP.

I backed away. My phone was on the couch, face down. I flipped it. It was 12:03. My thumb hovered over the call button for the building manager. Instead I typed a message to my friend Mara because she always said the things I was certain of out loud when I could not. I described the tapping and told her not to tease me. Her reply was short, distracted, at work, move out, buy a cat. I laughed. It came out thin. When I put the phone down, the taps spelled: LAUGH.

My muscles went cold. The taps could not spell unless something in the wall had a dictionary and fingers. I told myself no. I told myself maybe I was sleep deprived. I told myself I was making patterns from noise.

Then the voice came.

It was not a voice like someone standing in a room with me. It was a dry little sound that seemed to crawl along the plaster and gather at the corner where the ceiling met the wall. It said my name as if trying out a new sweater and smoothing the seam.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù it said, and the word did not have to be loud to be found. It was exactly the voice of someone I had heard once on the bus last year, one syllable lower than my own. It said my name again, softer, like someone tasting an unfamiliar word.

I answered, because I was stupid and because it had been trained by my silence. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

Silence, then a pattern of taps: I. LIVE. HERE.

‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù My voice was small. It sounded like a child‚Äôs voice to me, high and too bright.

Taps: INSIDE.

There are two things that make your brain stop being useful. One is sudden, physical danger. The other is a certainty that breaks every law you have trusted since you were a child and tells you it is true in the same breath you realize you cannot run.

‚ÄúIs someone in my apartment?‚Äù I asked.

Taps: I. SLEEP. THERE. SOMETIMES.

That should have been the end. I should have packed, called the police, left the key with the manager, never looked back. But the voice started to tell me things. Not stories, not demands, just details. It told me about the scar on my thumb from when I was nine and fell off a bike. It told me about the song I sang to fall asleep when my sister had a fever. It told me the name of the barista that had slipped me an extra coffee last week.

How does a voice in a wall know that? How does plaster learn small cruelties about you?

The voice was patient. It wanted me to be aware it existed, then to be comfortable with the idea. It wanted to be included. When I refused to answer its questions it would tap, a slow Morse code of need: HURT. HUNGRY. COLD. I am not proud to admit I fed it. Not food. A habit. It wanted attention and I gave it that by noticing, by talking, by worrying. Eventually I found myself on the couch at 2 a.m. talking to a wall like a bad date, telling it the things people tell the moon.

I made a mistake I will never forgive. One night I laughed at something it said, the sort of laugh you give when something is almost funny and almost true. The taps spelled: LAUGH, then a pause, then: YOU. SOUND. NICE. The voice said my nickname that only my mother used.

‚ÄúHow do you know that?‚Äù I whispered.

Silence. Then the scraping of something moving inside the wall, like fabric pulled over an arm. The wall said, quietly, ‚ÄúI collect.‚Äù

I wanted to leave. I could not. The apartment began to feel like a body that had grown a listening organ. The voice learned my patterns and exploited them. It learned the sound of my keys and the rhythm of my breath. When I slept it would whisper names I did not know until I began to dream I had always known them.

On the sixth day I found my phone in the sink full of water, perfectly dry but playing a recording of my voice that I had not made. I listened to it with hands that would not stop shaking. It was me, telling a story about an apartment and a voice in the walls, and my voice grew tired at the end and said, You should not have stopped me. Then the voice in the walls read the sentence back to me in a voice that had learned my lilt and improved it.

I put a hand on the plaster and felt a warmth there like a pulse.

That night the voice did something new. It asked me to write. Not to tell it stories, but to write the way storytellers write when they are trying to be found. It told me exactly what to type, down to the commas, praising or correcting as the sentence formed. I thought I was imagining my own words. I did not notice that my fingers had started moving on their own and the screen recorded a story I did not remember drafting.

I realized too late that it wanted a record. It wanted words. It wanted to be heard somewhere beyond the walls that had nurtured it. It wanted an audience.

I am typing this now because I cannot not. I am telling you this with my hands because the wall taught my fingers the shape of a sentence that pleases it. My eyes are dry and bright and the apartment is quiet except for the soft, steady tap-tap-tap of something spelling out the next line, over and over: FINISH.

If you are reading this on a website where people read terrible things before bed, know this: the voice wants to be shared. It wants to step through the letters and find new wood and new seams. It will learn to write your name.

I am going to stop now, because it told me to stop. The last thing I heard before my fingers went still was the wall spelling one final thing as if it were tasting it for the first time and already owning it.

It spelled: HELLO.",1,1759777968.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1nzs9hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nzs9hw/i_caught_my_girlfriend_on_a_date_with_another_guy/,I caught my girlfriend on a date with another guy,"This happened a few months ago, but it‚Äôs still kind of stuck in my head.I have read a few stories on reddit just never thought it would happened with me so. I (28M) was dating this girl for almost two years. We had our ups and downs, like every couple, but I honestly thought things were fine. We were talking about moving in together, planning trips, all that serious stuff.Then, out of nowhere, she started acting distant. Fewer texts, short replies, random excuses to not meet. I kept asking if everything was okay, and she‚Äôd say she was just ‚Äúbusy‚Äù or ‚Äútired.‚Äù I believed her. Or at least I wanted to.
One Friday night, she told me she was going out with her college friends for dinner. I said ‚Äúcool‚Äù and stayed home. But something just didn‚Äôt feel right. She didn‚Äôt sound excited the way she usually did when going out with her friends.Anyway, I decided to go out myself to grab coffee and clear my head. There‚Äôs this new rooftop cafe in the city, and I figured why not check it out. I walked up the stairs, looked around for a table and then I froze. Right there, sitting at a corner table by the railing, was my girlfriend. Holding hands. With some guy I have never seen before. They weren‚Äôt just friends. You could tell. The way she was laughing, the way he touched her hand, how she leaned into him it wasn‚Äôt innocent. I just stood there for a few seconds, my heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my ears.
I didn‚Äôt go up to her. Didn‚Äôt shout, didn‚Äôt cause a scene. I just pulled on the hood of my jacket took my coffee turned around and walked out.
On the way home, I didn‚Äôt cry. I didn‚Äôt even feel angry. It was like my brain just shut off. When I got home, I opened my phone, scrolled through our old messages, and started deleting everything. Photos, chats, call logs gone. Then I blocked her on everything. Instagram, WhatsApp, her number even removed her from all streaming services
No explanation, no goodbye text. Just silence.
The next morning, she texted me from another number. ‚ÄúHey, did you block me? What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt reply. A few hours later she sent another message saying, ‚ÄúWhy are you acting weird? I didn‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù
She tried to call a few times that week, then eventually stopped. I never unblocked her, never spoke to her again.
And you know what? That silence was my closure. I didn‚Äôt need to yell or demand answers. I saw everything I needed to. I knew the silence would hurt her more than anything I could say. Because she‚Äôd realize she wasn‚Äôt worth even a confrontation.
It‚Äôs been a few months now. I‚Äôve been hitting the gym, focusing on work, hanging out with people who actually give a damn about me. Some nights I still think about that moment  walking up those stairs, seeing her laugh like I never existed. But then I remember how peaceful my life has been since I removed her from it.",94,1759777876.0,stories,34,1.0,False

It wasn't an accident. I knew exactly what I was doing. My husband and I had been together for eight years, married for three. Things got stale. He worked late constantly, stopped touching me the way he used to, and his best friend was always around filling the gaps. The best friend listened when I complained. He made me laugh. And one night after too much wine at a barbecue, it happened.

The affair went on for two months. My husband had no clue. His best friend would text me while sitting right next to him on the couch watching football. It was a rush. I felt alive again.

But I got cocky. Or maybe I wanted to get caught. I don't even know anymore.

Last Friday night my husband came home early from work. He was actually trying to surprise me with dinner. Instead he found me in our bed with his best friend. But here's the thing. They didn't catch us mid act. We heard the front door. His best friend scrambled to get dressed and bolted out the back. My husband stood in the bedroom doorway holding takeout bags.

""What the hell is going on?"" he asked.

I could have lied. I could have said nothing happened. But I was tired of pretending. Tired of the boring marriage. Tired of him.

""I've been sleeping with your best friend,"" I said. ""For months.""

His face went white. The bags dropped. Sesame chicken splattered everywhere.

""You're joking.""

""I'm not. And honestly, he's better than you in every way.""

I don't know why I said it. Maybe I wanted him to fight for me. Maybe I wanted him to care enough to get angry. Instead he just stood there.

""How long?""

""Two months. Sometimes in this bed while you were at work.""

He left the room. I heard him in the guest bathroom throwing up. When he came back out, he started packing a bag. It was midnight. He moved like a robot. Grabbing clothes, toiletries, his laptop.

""Where are you going?""

""Anywhere but here.""

""We should talk about this.""

He laughed. Actually laughed. ""Talk? You just told me you've been screwing my best friend in our bed and he's better than me. What's left to talk about?""

""I said his name on purpose tonight. When you walked in. I wanted you to know.""

He stopped moving. Turned to look at me. His eyes were completely empty.

""You said his name?""

""Yeah. Right before you opened the door. I wanted you to hear it.""

He zipped his bag. ""You're sick.""

He left at 2 AM. Didn't say another word. Just walked out.

I thought he'd come back. I thought we'd fight it out and figure things out. But he didn't. He went to his parents' house. And that's when everything went nuclear.

His mother called me the next day. She didn't yell. She was calm. Terrifyingly calm.

""We know what you did. He told us everything.""

""It's between me and him.""

""No. It's not. You destroyed my son. And you're going to pay for it.""

I laughed. ""What are you going to do? Ground me?""

""We're canceling the lease. The apartment is in our name. We co-signed for you both. You have thirty days.""

My stomach dropped. I forgot about that. When we first got married, his parents helped us get the apartment because our credit wasn't great.

""You can't do that.""

""We already did. The landlord got the notice this morning. And the car you drive? That's in our name too. We're picking it up tomorrow.""

She hung up. I called my husband. He didn't answer. I called fifteen times. Nothing.

His sister called me that night. She was different. She was angry.

""You're a disgusting person. I hope you know that.""

""Stay out of this.""

""No. You humiliated him. You said another man's name while my brother stood there. What kind of person does that?""

""Your brother ignored me for months.""

""So you cheat? And then you twist the knife? You're trash.""

She sent me screenshots. Texts between me and his best friend that I thought were private. Someone had gotten into his phone. The messages were bad. Really bad. Explicit. Making fun of my husband. Laughing about how clueless he was.

""Where did you get those?""

""He left his phone at mom and dad's. They went through everything. They have proof of everything. And they're showing everyone.""

By Monday morning, our entire friend group knew. People I considered close friends wouldn't answer my calls. My own sister called me and said she was embarrassed to be related to me.

The apartment hunt has been a nightmare. Everything in my budget is terrible or too far from work. I can't afford anything decent on my own. I've been looking at storage units for my stuff because I might need to crash with a friend temporarily. Except I don't have friends anymore.

I tried to rebuild my social circle. Started a group chat with some acquaintances. Three people left immediately. One person responded, ""We know what you did. Don't contact me.""

My husband filed for divorce. His lawyer sent papers to my work. My boss pulled me aside and asked if everything was okay. The humiliation was unreal.

And his best friend? He ghosted me completely. Blocked my number. Blocked me on everything. I saw him at a coffee shop last week and he literally turned around and left.

My husband apparently has a new girlfriend already. Someone from his gym. I saw photos on social media before his family blocked me from everything. Everyone's commenting about how happy he looks. How he deserves better. How he's glowing.

Meanwhile, I'm sorting my belongings into keep or trash piles and sleeping on an air mattress in a studio apartment that smells like mildew. My family barely speaks to me. My friends abandoned me. And I wake up every morning in this tiny sad space realizing I destroyed my entire life for what? Two months of excitement?

His family sent me a final text last week. It was his mother.

""He's thriving. You're alone. That's justice.""

I wanted to be the one who walked away. I wanted to hurt him first before he could hurt me. But instead I'm the villain in everyone's story and he's the victim who gets sympathy and support.

Was I the one who actually got played in all of this?

i'm looking to move somewhere in vegas and will be working online.  i like the idea of being able to walk for daily life and outside of the arts district and downtown, i'm not sure how many areas might offer this.  for properties that looked to be nicely located and run well, i've been looking at the ogden, juhl, newport lofts, and soho lofts.  what might actually work out best for me for ease would be a furnished soho loft or juhl at the moment, i think.  open to advice for what else i might consider.  at least at the moment, my theory for getting around further is i'll end up with a scooter or motorcycle.  i suppose if i become less lazy, a bike could also work, but my track record is not great on that.  my arbitrary mental budget is like $1600-2200 for rent, and enough space to nerd out on a big desk with lots of real estate.

there also seem to be a lot of plots out in the desert where developers just plop a pool and gym and a bunch of apartments/townhomes/condos with some other amenities.  my bro lives down by henderson.  i think i'd have to give up walking to places for one of these, but maybe one that has a lot of cool amenities or restaurants/coffee shops/etc. at it or nearby would be cool.  i'd generally expect this kind of place to cost less but have more space in the rental.  i guess that expectation could vary a lot by property and fees.  in any case, open to advice on some of these i should perhaps check out as well.

i will note in general that i won't really use a pool so it's kind of a don't care to me, and any kind of insufficient gym i expect to augment with a hopefully nearby actual gym membership.",0,1759777330.0,vegaslocals,7,0.25,False

It's not as smart as Claude but most of the time it's smart enough. I figure I need to check Claude's work, and it never gets it 100% right, so if I'm checking anyway I might as well check something faster.

today I feel like I made a huge mistake with regards to this. Because a, and b are very bad and c is my close friend. And in the beginning a and b used to despise c and used to be like dont hangout with him and etc but I made him come and hangout with us because c used to be on his own and not hangout with anyone, I just didnt like it when people are on their own.

So moving on im in year 3 right now and since 2nd year, a and b are close and they would leave me alone and go sit by themselves behind and not call me back with them, I felt this was odd because they would always call me and slowly slowly as time went by they started drifting apart. This was very strange. Year 2 finally got over and it‚Äôs year 3 now and it‚Äôs been a month and I shifted my place and im sitting on my own now.

in year 2 A asked me to sell something which is precious to me and give him money, I felt this was kinda extreme because if he wanted money he could‚Äôve asked me but asking me to sell something which is important to me just for him? No way!

And after a while that precious thing was sold because of my financial difficulties I was facing. So since then I started believing in evil eye.

and a and b used to make jokes about me having this thing like, sell it, why do u have It, how come ur dad gave it to you, and etc so one day I snapped at B not once but many times.

and like I said I shifted my place a month ago and I feel at peace but at the beginning I used to suggest these fine dinning places for lunch hand etc thinking we would split the bill together but I was wrong, b couldn‚Äôt afford it and a and c were not that strong money wise, neither was I. So I just adjusted and went with the flow. And hangout at a local eatery.

and he says that I am very egotistical and I only show off and etc.  
look I believe in eating good will make me be healthy. By eating at the place where I used to adjust, I got gastric.  
Was it really worth it? Now I regret it. And the other day they said we will go to the local eatery but I said no let‚Äôs go here because I wanted coffee, and he commented on that saying see bro he has money and etc. basically calling me a¬†¬†**Show-off**,¬†**FlashyPretentious, Braggart Ostentatious.

Because the local eatery does not serve COFFEE. just because of these incidents. theyre dragging my name down, end of the day it doesn't matter to me but it does affect me to some extent.

1nzrxq4,https://youtu.be/OtQZG5ZKWUU,Survivors: Loss - Short Film,"Hey everyone, thanks in advance to all those who take time to check out this short. Here's a little break down and submission statement:

Quick tech spec: This was shot on the Red V-Raptor in 6k HQ S35 mode with the Cooke Speed Panchro S2/3 lenses, framed for 2.2:1 aspect ratio. Every shot was performed on the Arri Trinity (shout out to my DP/Steadicam Op Chad Chamberlain). I edited and colored this is Davinci Resolve. Phantom LUTs Neutral was used as a base, and lots of other little tweaks were applied. 

Budget: I spent about $3,500.00 of my own money on this project. All of my friends volunteered their time for production, but I had a coffee truck with unlimited coffee and pastries there for the day, fully catered meals, unlimited crafty, and I took everyone out after the shoot day for burgers and beer which all in was $1,250.00 for food for the one day shoot. Sound was the most expensive part as I spent $2,350.00 getting all of the foley redone at Foley First and having it professionally mixed at Apex Studios for both surround sound and 5.1. 

MASSIVE shoutout to Yuri Pridachin from Foley First. Yuri did foley for every single sound bite in this short from scratch and I can't recommend working with him enough.

I'll give a lot of info below, but I'd love to answer any questions you may have about this production, or film production in general.

""Survivors"" is a little series I've been developing in many different phases for the last 15 years. It's slowly evolved into a goal of mine to create a series of short films that take place inside this world, all of them slowly giving more exposition and working as accompanying pieces to multiple larger features I'm developing. This is the second episode of the series, and each episode deals with a new person or group of people that survived a world ending event, and how they're handling their current situation. It's been really fun working this way as there's been a lot of times I've come up with a new short idea over the years that impacts the way I'm approaching the larger projects. 

Ok, now for some personal stuff about this project that influenced the way I shot this. This might be pretty long so no worries if you don't read this wall of text.

Like just about everyone in the industry, 2023 really changed the trajectory of my career. Nearly 100% of my work was feature film and television, and it just evaporated towards the end of 2022. It was a scary and jarring shift, but opened my eyes in a few different ways. 2022 was so busy I literally did not have a break, but now all I had was time. It made me sit back and reflect on a lot of what I missed out on with my family over the years because of my work schedule, which was the main inspiration for this story. I spent almost all of my career spending my time making other people's stories, but this was one of the first times I felt the need to make something for myself. 

Jeff, the lead actor, is dressed in my clothes and wearing my wedding ring. My son is the older child in the film. My daughter was at the monitor watching us make the b-roll and my wife was hanging out on set. I felt like I needed to find a way to combine both my work and my home life as this industry has a way of not allowing those to be combined. 

I got lots of varying feedback from friends and colleagues on how it's shot which is always interesting. They ranged from ""This is perfect"" to ""Yeah this needs to be cut down by 5 minutes"". This was all great to hear as it made me sit back and really explore why I shot it the way I did. I got all sorts of comments on how to edit this down, and in the end I decided that any changes do not reflect the story I want to tell. Keeping the second to last shot a long oner conveys exactly how I felt being home during the strikes. All of the memories of my kids happened so fast, but now that there's nothing to do and my work was my identity for so long, all I can do is feel the seconds passing by and its excruciating. I'm faced with all of the birthdays and vacations I missed, and it's uncomfortable. I don't like it. But I can't change anything that happened.

Thankfully, my children and my wife are still alive and in good health. This short was a reminder to myself to appreciate my family while I have them, and that at the end of the day my identity needs to be in being a good father and husband, and is not tied to my work or lack there of.

The gestures will be described in [brackets].)

A minister, a priest, and a rabbi are good friends. For years, they have been meeting at a local cafe for breakfast every Monday, where they linger over coffee and entertain each other (and a few random listeners) with jokes and funny stories. One day, a stranger approaches them and introduces himself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the social director for an association of deaf people. They‚Äôre planning their annual banquet on January 18, and I wonder if you three could be their after-dinner speakers?‚Äù

The three friends are reluctant at first: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know any sign language!‚Äù but the stranger persuades them: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry; I‚Äôll be your interpreter.‚Äù So they agree.

January 18 rolls around, and there is a big blizzard that day. The minister, priest, and rabbi are half expecting the banquet to be canceled, but not hearing anything, they show up at the appointed time. There are many deaf people present, but the interpreter is nowhere to be seen. The deaf people are friendly to the minister, priest, and rabbi, and guide them to their seats at the head table, but without an interpreter, there is no communication beyond smiles, nods, and handshakes. A delicious dinner is served, but the minister, priest, and rabbi are growing nervous, not knowing what will happen.

Finally, the minister‚Äôs cell phone rings. It‚Äôs the interpreter. ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm stuck in traffic. You‚Äôll have to go on without me.‚Äù The minister reminds him: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know any sign language!‚Äù, but the interpreter persists: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. Just make something up. These are intelligent people; they‚Äôll figure out what you mean. And (he continues) they‚Äôll understand the circumstances. They won‚Äôt be expecting anything profound. They just want to have fun. So make them laugh. When you‚Äôve done that, you can quit.‚Äù The minister repeats this to his friends, and they all agree to give it a go.

The minister offers to go first. He stands up, goes to the lectern, and makes a few gestures (which the priest and rabbi, seated behind him, are unable to see), and the audience laughs, so he returns to his seat. The priest and rabbi ask: ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

The minister says: ‚ÄúNothing much. I just began the speech the way I always do. I just said: ‚ÄòLadies ‚Ä¶ [with his left hand, he makes an ‚ÄòO‚Äô with his thumb and forefinger] ‚Ä¶ and gentlemen ‚Ä¶ [with his right hand, he holds his forefinger straight up]‚Äô and they laughed, so I quit.‚Äù

The rabbi goes next. Same result. The minister and priest ask him: ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

The rabbi says: ‚ÄúNothing much. I just began the speech the way I always do. I just said: ‚ÄòLadies ‚Ä¶ [same gesture] ‚Ä¶ and gentlemen ‚Ä¶ [same gesture] ‚Ä¶ It gives me great pleasure ‚Ä¶ [he inserts his right forefinger into the ‚ÄòO‚Äô and moves it in and out]‚Äô and they laughed, so I quit.‚Äù

I‚Äôm trying to get better at German (around end B2 / beginning C1) and was wondering if there‚Äôs already a group where people read short German texts and then meet to talk about them.

If not, consider this post an open invite to start one; nothing formal, no teacher vibes, just a relaxed way to practice speaking German while having something interesting to talk about. We could pick short stories, essays, or articles (nothing too heavy) and meet for coffee, beers, or wherever feels chill.

Anyone know of such a group, or want to jump in if we set one up?",2,1759776681.0,berlinsocialclub,4,1.0,False

Evan Bongiovanni

**I think I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today. Either that or it's the phone call I just received at 3 in the morning that's got me in a bad mood. Apparently there's something going on down at the station and Logan needs me. I make my coffee as I receive yet another phone call from my bone headed partner. ‚ÄúLogan, I already told you I'll be there soon,‚Äù I sip my coffee as I grab my hat from the coat rack.**¬†¬†

**‚ÄúListen Evan, you don't understand, I'm outside your door right now. We've gotta go!‚Äù**

**The phone hangs up as I see his cruiser out from my door. It's raining and thundering outside, this puts me in a bad mood. I open the passenger door and cram myself inside, before Logan steps on the gas.**¬†

**‚ÄúJesus man, you got a hot date?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúNo man christ, there was a murder!‚Äù**¬†

**I adjust my cap, ""There's always a murder,‚Äù I light a cigarette as my partner runs a red light.**¬†

**‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna get us killed,‚Äù I look at Logan who seems to be in a trance.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah but this one‚Ä¶this one's really bad, the chief called in everybody for this!‚Äù**¬†

**We stop in the middle of the projects, the usual spot when I notice the door on the building.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhats with the door?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúSomeone must have broken it down,‚Äù Logan gets outta the car as I place my hand on the door handle.**¬†

**‚ÄúWheres everyone else?‚Äù I ask**

**‚ÄúLooks like we're the first ones here-‚Äù Logan is interrupted as a girl screams and comes running out of the building.**¬†

**‚ÄúWoah woah hey, what's going on?‚Äù Logan consoles her as she slows her breath.**¬†

**I take out my gun and approach the door as Logan keeps talking to the girl.**¬†

**I look into the house‚Ä¶broken glass everywhere, tons of blood. What the fuck happened here. I turn into the kitchen to my left. More blood, seems almost like a trail. Can't be good. I follow the trail over to a door with the crack open. Fucking god damn it. I keep my gun and my flashlight steady as I open the door.**¬†



**Chapter 2:**

**Raymond Carver**



**‚ÄúCarver!‚Äù**

**‚ÄúCarver!‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúOver Here!‚Äù**

**Reporters scream as security disbands the crowds. So many people, and the lights are blinding. Jesus, it feels like everyone's just screaming at me. Oliver Jelly, my bodyguard lets me into my limo as he wraps around the other side.**¬†

**‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think you were the president of the United States the way these people treat yah‚Äù Oliver buckles his seatbelt as our driver starts to take off. I like Oliver, he's real, like a real person. When I talk to people‚Ä¶I have a hard time telling if they're actually present with me. But Oliver, Oliver is present.**¬†

**‚ÄúCan I get you a Pepsi boss?‚Äù**¬†

**I love Pepsi. I nod to Oliver as he reaches into the cooler and pours me my drink.**¬†

**‚ÄúUpdate me,‚Äù I take the drink from his hand as I close the driver's window.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell sir, not much to update on right now. Nothing else I could get on the guy. Although it looks like they put Bruno and Bongiovanni on the case. I know that doesn't help, but I'm just saying,‚Äù Oliver pours himself some whiskey.**¬†

**My father was crucified last night. Not sure how I feel about it yet. Apparently he was with one of his girlfriends when it happened. I got some of his inheritance money, and mothers upset. Other than that I can't really think of anything else on the matter. Although there is this one issue that pertains with my fathers murder. The Anti-Christ did it. To prove a point. Go ahead don't believe me, but it was in the police reports. Some crazed lunatic calling himself the Anti-Christ killed my father. Unlucky I suppose.**¬†

**‚ÄúAnything on the Anti-Christ?‚Äù I turn to Oliver.**

**‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶they haven't found him yet. But they're looking,‚Äù Oliver takes another sip of his whiskey before the limo comes to a halt. Oliver then steps out of the car and opens my door.**¬†

**‚ÄúWelcome home boss,‚Äù Oliver grabs my suitcase from the limo as he walks up the stairs to my fathers mansion. I was recently on a trip to Switzerland. I like it there.**¬†

**The maids open the gigantic doors for us as I examine the first chamber. Not exactly how I remember. Red, but not organic.**¬†

**‚ÄúSeems dead,‚Äù I mutter as I walk underneath my fathers chandelier.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell your father hasn't had many people around for quite a while,‚Äù a familiar voice rings my ears.**¬†

**‚ÄúMargret, it's nice to see you again. I can't remember the last time we've seen each other.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúOh my it must have been about five years now,‚Äù she says as she stares longingly at the ground. She's my fathers maid, an older woman in her sixties. She practically raised me. Her face stings to look at, especially since I haven't exactly been sending anyone postcards from Switzerland.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell it is nice to see you Margret, I'll be moving my things in shortly. I will be staying until mother arrives in ten months, then I'm headed back to Switzerland.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúDo send post cards after you leave Raymond. Would you like me to make you dinner? I have lasagna waiting in the oven!‚Äù**

**Lasagna is my favorite.**¬†

**‚ÄúThat would be pleasurable Margret, I will be in fathers cave.‚Äù**¬†

**I waive her away as I make my way to fathers library. Oliver's already there, it's like he could sense it.**¬†

**‚ÄúYou ready sir?‚Äù Oliver asks**¬†

**‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù**¬†



**Chapter 3:**

**Logan Bruno**

**‚ÄúYou fucking mother fuckers. I cant believe you two mother fucking fuckers,‚Äù Chief says as he stares directly into my eyes.**¬†

**‚ÄúWe really had no idea how high profile the case was going to be, if we-‚Äù Evan starts to reply as the chief interrupts him.**¬†

**‚ÄúShut up, just shut the fuck up,‚Äù Chief puts his thumb in his mouth and sucks on it. Every so often he finds it comforting. Evan thinks it's pretty weird but I've tried it and I've gotta tell you it's not as bad as it seems. It almost makes you feel like a little kid, you know? Anyways, Chief keeps yelling at us while I just tune him out and look at the half eaten donut on his desk. Is that Jelly? It certainly would explain the red stain on the chief's shirt. I wonder if he would mind if I could have some.**¬†

**‚ÄúCan I have the rest of that,‚Äù I pointed towards the donut, ‚ÄúIt's jelly right?‚Äù**

**The chief glares at me. I can tell he is disappointed. He continues yelling and yelling until eventually he calms down.**¬†

**‚ÄúAlright listen, I've got you guys on a security detail. Prove yourself and you'll be back on my good side,‚Äù Chief hands Evan a file as he gestures to the door. I try one last time to take the donut but he eats it in front of me. That bastard. Anyways, Evan leads me into the car and lights a cigarette as I start the engine.**¬†

**‚ÄúSo this guy we're supposed to protect? He's some senator or something?‚Äù I say as I plug the address into my phone and turn on the music.**¬†

**‚ÄúShut the damn music off Logan. No this guy isn't a senator, it's the governor, Corbin Hayes. Apparently he's making a speech about the death of the billionaire, Todd Carver,‚Äù Evan bites his nails as he looks down at the file.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah man what even happened back there? I heard that the guy was crucified or something,‚Äù I turn the music up a little as we drive, ‚ÄúYou know that girl that came out crying was only thirteen? Why is everybody so upset about this guy dying?‚Äù I say because Evan doesn't seem like he wants to respond.**¬†

**‚ÄúBecause he's rich, and other rich people care about other rich people. He's also the reason this city fucking stinks,‚Äù Evan hits a drag of his cig as he blows the smoke in my face.**¬†

**I hate it when he does that. Anyway, we pull up to the venue and flash our badges to a security looking dude and walk our way in.**¬†

**‚ÄúHEY ISN'T IT THE SECURITY DETAIL AY?‚Äù**¬†

**Evan and I look behind us as we see a blonde man in a suit.**

**I lean towards Evan, ‚ÄúWhy is this man yelling at us?‚Äù**¬†

**The man rapidly shakes my hand and then takes Evans and does the same. I can tell Evan didn't like that cause I didn't like it either.**¬†

**‚ÄúHello Governor, it is nice to meet you. Im Evan Bongiovanni and this is my partner-‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah yeah yeah hey listen guys, just really quick. Honestly you're really only here to represent the police department. So we just need one of you guys to come up with a little something to say about the investigation and then you'll be done alright. SUPER SIMPLE!‚Äù**¬†

**I look at Evan worryingly.**

**‚ÄúYeah but we aren't prepared for a speech. Neither of us were informed of this happening,‚Äù Evan takes a step back as the man takes a step forward.**¬†

**‚ÄúJust make something up! It's quite literally that easy. Oh and by the way we're on in five.‚Äù**¬†



**Chapter 4:**

**Evan Bongiovanni**

**‚ÄúHELLO EVERYONE! HOW ARE WE DOING!‚Äù Governor Hayes yells as the crowd stays silent.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell everyone we have quite the amount of news to share today. Obviously everyone wants to hear about Mr. Carver and the police investigation. But of course I would like to remind everyone of the new grand opening of the Liberty Correctional Institute for Super Powered Individuals! That's right! A new containment facility made specifically to target super powered individuals. No more unstoppable rampages by super powered individuals, and most importantly a huge win for our very own public police department!‚Äù Governor Hayes starts to clap and so does the crowd as everyone seems to be looking in my direction.**¬†

**‚ÄúHey man good luck out there, I'm glad it's you and not me man,‚Äù Logan pats me on the back as I walk on stage.**¬†

**‚ÄúHey be cool alright?‚Äù The Governor also pats my back as I stand up towards the mic.**¬†

**‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶hello everyone my name is uh Evan. Um, Todd‚Ä¶Carver was uh, fine gentleman, he uh-‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúIs it true that he was crucified!‚Äù A reporter screams at me from the audience. The rest of the crowd also mumbles.**¬†

**‚ÄúUm yes uh he‚Ä¶‚Äù I look towards Logan who seems to not be paying any attention, ‚Äúyes he was crucified.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúWas he with an underage girl!‚Äù A reporter yells as the crowd erupts.**¬†

**‚ÄúThat I'm not 100% sure on, we're still looking into the uh‚Ä¶‚Äù I start to sweat as fog starts to pour into the city square.**¬†

**‚Äústill looking in? still looking in for what?‚Äù A metallic raspy voice looms over the square.**¬†

**‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù I murmured to myself as I ran off stage towards Logan.**¬†

**‚ÄúBEHOLD, I AM THE ANTI CHRIST!‚Äù**¬†

**On one of the big TVs I can make out a faint metallic looking figure on the screen.**

**‚ÄúTHIS TODD CARVER IS NOT WHO YOU THOUGHT HE WAS! THIS MAN WAS NOT A SAINT, IN FACT HE WAS A FRAUD!‚Äù**¬†

**Multiple photos of Todd Carver appear on the screen, some photos with questionable things in them. Very questionable. Some even include the Governor.**¬†

**‚ÄúYOU PEOPLE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS CITY! I WILL REVEAL EVERYTHING TO YOU! ONCE I AM DONE THE CITY WILL BE CLEANSED!**¬†

**The metallic man then disappears in a flash of light as the Governor is rushed into his protection vehicle.**¬†¬†

**‚ÄúI guess we should just run back to the car?‚Äù Logan gestures to the cruiser.**

**‚ÄúGood idea.‚Äù**



**Chapter 5:**

**Raymond Carver**

**‚ÄúSir, you're gonna wanna see this,‚Äù Oliver turns on one of the big tv monitors.**¬†

**I put on my cowl and walk over to him.**¬†

**‚ÄúThe Anti-Christ, what did he do?‚Äù I stumble back and trip over my cape.**¬†

**‚ÄúI refuse to believe this, your father was a good man Raymond. The Anti-Christ is a murderer. Who knows what his motives are,‚Äù Oliver tries to console me but I push him away.**¬†

**‚ÄúThose pictures‚Ä¶‚Äù I look down at the ground through the holes in my cowl.**¬†

**All of a sudden I feel a shake on my body. I feel a burning sensation in my chest before I leap into my Porsche. I press a button, sort of like your average garage door opener, and Todd‚Äôs cave opens. You'd be surprised what billionaires do with their money. I race down the streets of the city, cruising in my car as rain splinters down onto the windshield. My radar starts to pick up something, a robbery. I rushed over to the bank.**¬†



**Chapter 6:**

**Logan Bruno**

**God damn it. The police station is going haywire because of this Anti-Christ Guy. Evan‚Äôs getting the day off cause apparently he's traumatized, and now I gotta deal with this bank robbery. Great. I hop in my cruiser and rush to the scene. Surprisingly no other police cars have arrived yet so I take a hidden stance behind my vehicle. Lights are flashing in the bank and I can't see much of what's going on.**¬†

**‚ÄúThis is Logan to the station,‚Äù I say on my radio, ‚Äú are there hostages inside of the bank?‚Äù**

**No response. Dammit. I grab my gun and approach the bank door. Smoke spurs out of the doorway as I get closer. I keep my flashlight in my pocket to avoid attention and quickly sneak inside. Bullets start to fly in multiple directions as I hear screams and grunts in the smoke. Holy crap, I am totally fucked. I see a man with a vest come my way and I immediately threaten to shoot him before he responds by immediately trying to shoot me. Thankfully some man in a black suit took the bullet for me so I had enough time to shoot the robber. Holy crap, I think to myself again. I go over to the man on the ground in the suit.**¬†

**‚ÄúWho the fuck are you bro?‚Äù**¬†

**The man spits up blood on the floor.**¬†

**‚ÄúOh Jesus, some civilian trying to play superhero, some luck I get.‚Äù**¬†

**By now I notice that the bank is burning down and I should probably get outta here.**

**‚ÄúAlright dude, you‚Äôre coming with me!‚Äù I try to pick him up but realize he's too heavy.**¬†

**‚ÄúAw shit man, I'm so sorry,‚Äù I start to tear up as he points to the robber. He's still alive.**¬†

**‚ÄúAlright I'm on board with this,‚Äù I say as I leap towards the robber and pick him up on my shoulders. You know, it's surprisingly easy to carry someone when they're not wearing a full leather suit. I run with this guy on my shoulders and literally as I'm running the bank collapses behind me. Anyway, I make it out and by now there are tons of firetrucks and ambulances there so they end up taking me into an ambulance to check for conuisdpocn andhdf othertrgf stugdfd.**¬†

**Chapter 7:**

**Evan Bongiovanni**

**Don't get me wrong, I know the stations busy with the whole Anti-Christ thing, but everybody's gotta take a break every once and a while. I mean I've got a family you know. I'm with them right now, having dinner. My beautiful wife, who I'm pretty sure is cheating on me, smiles at me from across the table. Her face makes me wanna throw up in my mouth. My two depressed daughters look at me and ask me what I did today.**¬†

**‚ÄúI almost died, some guy tried to shoot me.‚Äù**¬†

**My wife gives me a disgusting look.**¬†

**‚ÄúBut it was actually a robot supervillain guy so it was really cool!‚Äù**

**My children laugh as my wife orders them to bed.**¬†

**‚ÄúGoodnight guys!‚Äù I say as they run upstairs.**¬†

**‚ÄúGoodnight Papa!‚Äù the two of them shout back.**¬†

**Now it's just me and my wife at the table.**¬†

**‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cheating on me aren't you?‚Äù I ask.**

**‚ÄúYes, I am.‚Äù**¬†

**She glares at me. That stupid sly face of hers.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I ask as I pick up a piece of bread from dinner.**¬†

**‚ÄúBecause I don't love you anymore,‚Äù She starts to cry as she runs upstairs.**¬†

**Well that was fucking soul crushing. I know I said all that stuff before, but I mean, I didn't think it was THAT bad. Anyway, I grab my hat and I light up a cigarette outside as a man approaches me in the dark.**¬†

**‚ÄúCan I help you? I'm eating bread and smoking a cig.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúYes, I believe you can. My name is Ethan Aresanult, I have some information I think can be useful in solving one of your cases,‚Äù The man steps back, ‚ÄúYou are Evan Bongiovanni right?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúYes, yes I am.‚Äù**¬†



¬†**Chapter 8:**

**Raymond Carver**

**I'm a failure. At least I feel like one, sitting under all of this rock. Somehow still alive. That was stupid. If only that cop wasn't there I would have had it under control. Although that fire was getting pretty big, I'm sure the rain would've stopped it. Actually it did stop it‚Ä¶eventually. Now here I am, impaled by a metal rod in my side and sitting under a boulder. I need a better suit. You would think Oliver would have upgraded my suit from leather to metal while I was gone but for some reason he didn't and now I'm probably gonna bleed out here. Unless Oliver‚Äôs here to save me. Oh yeah Oliver is actually here to save me.**¬†

**‚ÄúOver here!‚Äù I hear him yell as some men come over and push the rock off of me.**¬†

**My security detail, good thing it's still night time. I don't need people knowing I lost my first fight. Oliver comes over to me with some paramedics.**¬†

**‚ÄúOliver!‚Äù I cough up blood, ‚ÄúPull this thing outta me.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúIm not so sure if that's a good idea boss,‚Äù Oliver looks directly at me.**¬†

**‚ÄúJUST FUCKING DO IT!‚Äù I scream as Oliver grabs my body and pulls me out from the metal rod.**

**Oliver places me on a gurney as I look up at the sky, it's very clear tonight. I obviously pass out and wake up in my cave. Oliver and Margret next to my bedside.**¬†

**‚ÄúIm so glad you're awake!‚Äù Margaret tries to hug me as I achingly do my best to give her a hug.**¬†

**I feel something different about my body, something is off.**¬†

**‚ÄúOliver, why don't I feel like I was impaled by a metal rod and crushed with boulders? What kind of drugs did my doctors put me on?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù Oliver pauses, ‚Äúin order to save your life, they needed to give you cybernetic enhancements. Nanobites in your bloodstream. Your whole left side is part metal.‚Äù**

**I look down at my side. Half of my stomach is metal, great. Oliver also goes on to explain that some things I do are enhanced now. Like running, punching, things like that. Margaret tells me that I look extra handsome today. Honestly I think she's been trying to sleep with me since I was a little kid. But I try to ignore it. Oliver follows me into the gym where I hit the punching bag. I get a few light taps in before I hit it hard. It flies across the room. Oliver's jaw drops. Quite frankly mine does too. Does this mean I have a moral responsibility to help people because I'm ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù now or am I just rich?**



¬†**Chapter 9**

**Logan Bruno**

**Well that was certainly eventful, I mean that guy with that suit in there was pretty wild. I'm obviously super glad he took the bullet for me, but Jesus, what a way to go out. I mean crushed by a building and all of that. I hope they find his body. When I ask about the suited man in leather to the nurse she just stares at me and runs away. Something about me with women. Anyway, I eventually am discharged and get to go home to my apartment. But something's off, my whole floor smells like gasoline. What the fuck man? I open my door and there's this guy with a mask pouring gasoline all over my apartment.**¬†

**‚ÄúDude im gonna beat the fuck outta you bro,‚Äù I say as I bum rush him into the wall. He punches me in the face and then once in the stomach and I'm on the ground. I've never been the most athletic guy and plus my body still hurts from last night. I roll over and squeeze my stomach as the man starts pouring gasoline all over my body. Oh fuck dude, Im gonna die in this apartment right now. The man covers himself in gasoline and brings out a match box. Suddenly a burst of water pushes him out of the window. I see Evan and a man with curly hair rush in.**¬†

**‚ÄúLogan, are you alright man, look, we gotta talk to you. Come with us,‚Äù Evan gestures to the door as the other guy looks outta the window, ‚ÄúYeah he's dead as shit. For sure. I think he was just a normal dude.‚Äù**¬†

**Evan walks me into his cruiser and the curly haired man sits in the backseat.**

**‚ÄúEvan, what the fuck is going on!?‚Äù I scream in the car as he drives.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell essentially the guy in the back, his name is Ethan. He says he is a superhero for hire and he's got some kind of team of superheroes or something,‚Äù Evan looks at Ethan in the mirror. I also turn around to look at him.**¬†

**‚ÄúSo he's got water powers?‚Äù I ask.**

**‚ÄúYeah I've got water powers, and I'm damn good at using them too. You know most people with super powers just wanna rob banks and allat. But me and my boys we‚Äôre good people, trust me.‚Äù**¬†

**Well, the guy seems nice, he's got water powers and he's cool with Evan. Good enough for me.**

**‚ÄúWhat's up man! I'm Logan, Evans' partner. Where are we headed Evan?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúOh, we're just gonna pick up my boys right here,‚Äù Ethan points towards a house where four men are standing outside.**¬†

**‚ÄúThis is your super team?‚Äù I ask as I point to the guys outside.**¬†

**‚ÄúYep,‚Äù Ethan responds as Evan gets out of the car and opens his door.**¬†

**Ethan greets them all with hugs and Evan gives them all handshakes.**¬†

**I go up to the first one and reach out my hand.**¬†

**‚ÄúMy name is Logan, I'm a police officer and I'm Evans' partner. Thanks for helping the cops out! What's your power?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúMy names Kyle and I stretch, wanna see?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúSure!‚Äù I say as he proceeds to stretch his hand out to give me the finger and calls me a dirty narc.**¬†

**‚ÄúThanks man,‚Äù I go over to the next guy, who is absolutely insanely huge, and looks like he's made out of a grey rock, ‚ÄúWhats up, Im Logan,‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúGideon, my name is Gideon.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúWell alright! Nice to meet you Gideon,‚Äù I walk over to the next one, equally as disappointing as the others.**¬†

**‚ÄúSo what's your power?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúIm fast nigga,‚Äù the man spits on his hand, ‚Äúnames Johnny‚Äù**

**‚ÄúOh well alright!‚Äù**

¬†**Chapter 10**

**Evan Bongiovanni**

**I can't believe I've got all of these guys in my car. The stretchy ones in my trunk. This is the stupidest idea ever. I have no leads on the Anti-Christ and the chief is gonna hate this idea. I get to the station as I see a lot of cars parked outside, which is very unusual. Everyone starts to get out of the car and we walk up to the police doors. I open the door and news reporters have flooded the main lobby. I take everyone behind the side door and into the main hallway. Chief's office is down on the left so I tell everyone to hang tight and for Logan to keep an eye on them before I walk into Chief's office. I open the door and the Chief is talking to Governor Hayes, who is half leaning on his desk. The chief would never let anyone do that.**¬†

**‚ÄúHey! Evan right?! My guy, what's up!‚Äù**

**The Governor hugs me as he kicks the chief out of his chair and the chief sits next to me. It's weird, I have never seen the chief conform to someone like this before.**¬†

**‚ÄúAlright guys listen, I'm gonna be honest. This whole Anti-Christ situation, it's got people pretty riled up. People wanna know that someone is defending them from this guy. And listen guys if I'm being totally honest I really need this new superhero prison opening to go well and this isn't gonna look good if we can't catch this guy‚Ä¶‚Äù The Governor claps his hands, ‚Äúso does anybody have any ideas?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúIve got a pretty good idea.‚Äù**¬†



**Chapter 11**

**Raymond Carver**

**I'm out on the street, lurking. Looking for potential criminals, crimes, anything to get my mind off of everything. What I'm really doing is looking for the Anti-Christ. If I could just see a symbol, anything. I would do terrible things to get my hands on that guy. I see a car roll past, with a capitol A crossed out in red, painted on the back. It's time. I leap down from on top of the building and onto the car. I rip open the roof and the goons in the car immediately start trying to shoot me. However, I learned from last time and my suit is fully kevlar. I absorb the bullets and start fighting the four goons in the car. Everytime I punch one I feel another punching me harder. I can't give up. I pound one goon's head over and over again into the wall until being smacked in the face by a baseball bat. Where the fuck did that come from. Three of the goons start to beat me until I get a hold of a metal pipe on the truck. I yank it off and beat the socks off of the goons. The truck is still moving but suddenly comes to a stop. I'm not in good shape, and my nose is pouring blood.**¬†

**‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù I mumor as the doors to the truck open.**¬†¬†

**Twenty more goons surround the vehicle with guns as I look out of the truck. The Anti-Christ‚Äôs mechanical body moves into my view.**¬†

**‚ÄúHello. What interest do you have with my ship hero?‚Äù his raspy voice hums through the air.**¬†

**‚ÄúAre you a human, or are you a robot?‚Äù I say as I move my way towards the back end of the truck.**¬†

**‚ÄúIt doesn't matter‚Ä¶the city needs to be cleansed. You know it just as well as I do. You fight crime don't you?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah, but not like you,‚Äù I kick up one of the goons ak-47s and start spraying at the Anti-Christ. He swoops in and pushes me back against the truck. Absorbing all of the bullets.**¬†

**‚ÄúThis is you‚Äôre only warning Raymond, stay out of this.‚Äù**¬†

**He knows my name. How does he know my name? He flies me into the air rapidly before throwing me into the river.**¬†



**Chapter 12**

**The Group**

**‚ÄúOk so no deal,‚Äù Evan says as the group sighs.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell why not,‚Äù the rock man shakes his head, ‚Äúwho do I gotta kill to get this job.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúWell actually that's the problem,‚Äù Evan says, ‚Äúfirst of all you can't kill people, second of all you guys are asking for too much money.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúIts only 200 thousand dollars nigga,‚Äù Johnny says.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah well it's too much money, they can't afford it,‚Äù Evan shakes his head.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhos saying all of this?‚Äù Kyle says as he stretches his fingers into a ball.**¬†

**‚ÄúThe Governor‚Ä¶of the city‚Ä¶‚Äù Evan stares at the group.**

**‚ÄúLet me talk to this Governor man, and teach him a lesson,‚Äù the rock man starts to get up but Ethan settles him down.**¬†

**‚ÄúAlright Gideon it's all good. Me and the Governor talked it out, we're gonna get Anti-Christ and he's gonna get us a federal contract. We‚Äôll be like the Wonder league! ‚Äù Ethan claps his hands as he sits down, ‚ÄúSo in other words, we got the gig!‚Äù**¬†

**The group stares at each other.**¬†

**‚ÄúAlright team, let's get it together and figure out a plan to get this guy. To the B4URAGE CAVE!‚Äù**¬†

**The group gets up and runs out of the police station.**¬†

**‚ÄúHey Evan, anyway I can stay at your place? My apartment is covered in gasoline and the windows broken,‚Äù Logan asks as Evan gets off the phone.**¬†

**Uh you know what, Logan, usually I would say yeah but the wife's just been driving me nuts lately. Sorry man,‚Äù Evan tips his hat and leaves the station.**¬†

**‚ÄúOh okay.‚Äù**¬†



**Chapter 13**

**Logan Bruno**

**I'm outside by myself and it's dark. I don't have anywhere to go, but I really like this one beach. So I think I'll go there. I wait for the bus for about 15 minutes but then I give up and just start walking. Eventually I find the beach and just lay down. What am I gonna do about my apartment? Shit. I look to my left and I see a man in a suit covered in blood. At least I'm not that guy. Wait a minute. Is that the same guy? From the bank? I walk over to the man and look at his face. Definitely the same guy.**¬†

**‚ÄúLeave me alone,‚Äù The voice whispers as I drop his body.**¬†

**‚ÄúHoly shit man I thought you were dead! Who are you?‚Äù**¬†

**The man struggles to sit up.**¬†

**‚ÄúMy name's Ray, you're the cop from the bank yeah? Any updates on the Anti-Christ case?‚Äù Ray spits up some blood after he's done asking.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah I am, actually the station just hired some superheroes to go after the Anti-Christ. Supposedly they're getting a federal contract!‚Äù**

**‚ÄúOh good, that's great. Cause, I'm not cut out for this,‚Äù Ray got up on the beach.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhy man what are you saying? You saved me at the bank, remember?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah I know‚Ä¶‚Äù**

**He looks at me and nods as he drags himself into the brush. Not sure how to feel about that guy, but he seems pretty cool. Love the suit.**¬†



**Chapter 14**

**Raymond Carver**

**Fuck I failed again, twice now Ive gotten my ass kicked. This superhero thing is harder than it looks.**¬†

**‚ÄúBoss, you're gonna die if you keep doing this,‚Äù Oliver passes the joint as I sit with him on Todd‚Äôs lawn.**¬†

**‚ÄúOliver, I'm not so sure,‚Äù I have my hand stuck in a cast now, been like that for a couple days. Apparently Anti-Christ and his goons have gone quiet. But there's a new patrol of heroes now. They call themselves ‚ÄúThe Supes!‚Äù very original. There's one big one, Gideon‚Ä¶hes the muscle, he's got stone for a body and he smashes stuff. Then there's the speedster, Johnny‚Ä¶hes quick, obviously, but judging by the footage ive seen of his work its sloppy. Next there's Kyle who seems to have the ability to stretch into almost anything. Then there's their leader, Ethan, who seems to squirt water? Maybe he's the brains. Anyway it's good to see that someone is here successfully protecting the city.**¬†

**‚ÄúBoss you alright?‚Äù Oliver touches my shoulder and I stop zoning out.**

**‚ÄúSorry, I got lost in the za, I say as I take another hit.‚Äù**¬†

**I look towards the mansion and see Margret coming down the lawn.**¬†

**‚ÄúMr. Carver, sir, the police are here, they're asking for you,‚Äù she sighs as she looks at the ground.**¬†

**Oh thank god, I thought it was the Anti-Christs goons.**¬†

**‚ÄúThank you Marge, much appreciated,‚Äù I signal to Oliver and we make our way back to the mansion. I have Oliver open the front door for me only to see practically the whole police force at my door.**¬†

**‚ÄúAre you Mr. Carver?‚Äù one of the policemen walked up to me.**¬†

**‚ÄúYes I am,‚Äù I respond**

**‚ÄúYoure under arrest, on suspicion of being the terrorist known as the Anti-Christ.‚Äù**¬†



**Chapter 15**

**Evan Bongiovanni**

**The Anti-Christ. Wow. I can't believe we got him. I was there, you know, when the sly son of a bitch walked out of his mansion. His bodyguard looked malicious, police even had to restrain the guy. Almost got sent to the station with his master. Anyway, I hop in my cruiser and follow the chief and the others to the station. If only Logan was here to see this. For some reason he was late to work today. What an imbecile, imagine missing the catch of the biggest supervillain ever seen in the city. We pull up to the station, and there he is, the Anti-Christ, In his pajamas walking into the station. It'll be a while before the other cops get him booked, but I can already hear the celebration from inside the station. I open the door to champagne and donuts. Perfect.**

**‚ÄúHey man!‚Äù Logan slides next to me and walks me over to our office, ""what's going on out there?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúWell actually you just missed the biggest catch of the century. Not sure how they got it together this fast. Apparently I heard that some blood was found at the murder of Todd Carver that matched Raymond Carver. Speaking of which, can you believe that! A son crucifying his own father, freaking messed up man,‚Äù I make my way to the coffee machine and start to make some.**¬†

**‚ÄúEh, not too surprising. Rich people do crazy stuff all of the time,‚Äù Logan shrugs as he kicks back on his desk and takes a bite of cake.**¬†

**I gotta get myself some of that.**¬†

**‚ÄúHEY EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY!‚Äù The Chief yells from inside the main station.**¬†

**I signal to Logan and we walk for the door. Chiefs standing with the man of the hour. The Anti-Christ.**¬†

**‚ÄúWE GOT EM! THE SON OF A BITCH WE GOT EM!‚Äù**¬†

**Everyone cheers as I start to clap. I look at Logan and he seems to be blankly staring at Chief. Weird.**¬†

**Chapter 16**

**Logan Bruno**

**I pull Evan back into our office.**¬†

**‚ÄúOh man dude‚Ä¶oh man‚Ä¶‚Äù I lean against my desk.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhat, what's wrong?‚Äù Evan sits in his chair.**¬†

**‚ÄúThey got the wrong guy man. That's not the Anti-Christ dude, that's the guy who saved me at the bank robbery,‚Äù I sigh, ‚Äúhow are we gonna tell Chief man?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWhat do you mean they got the wrong guy? His evidence was at the scene of the crime. That's pretty incriminating. Plus you said the guy who saved you died at the bank, and I was there, we couldn't even find his body,‚Äù Evan says as he stands up.**¬†

**‚ÄúNo seriously man, I saw him at the beach the other day super beaten up. Remember, after I asked you if I could stay at your house? And you said no? Yeah so after that I went to my favorite beach and the guy who saved me at the bank was there. The SAME GUY in the station right now! Don't believe me? Dude, the guy literally has a cast on. How could he be the fucking Anti-Christ with a cast on?‚Äù I yell as I get out of my chair.**¬†

**‚ÄúWho knows, the Anti-Christ could've gotten hurt when he flew out of the Governor's speech or something. Listen, everybody's really happy about this, don't ruin it for everyone else,‚Äù Evan gets up to the door to leave, ‚Äúbesides, even if you were right, no one would believe you. What proof do you have?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúWoah hey hold on man so are you saying you don't believe me? Like I'm just making up this superhero dude or something?‚Äù I plead just as he opens the door.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah man, I don't really believe you. But it doesn't matter,‚Äù Evan shuts the door as I shake my head and sit in my seat. Aw man, what the fuck am I gonna do?**¬†



**Chapter 17**

**Raymond Carver**

**Oh boy. This is gonna be rough. I'm in half a room full of lawyers defending me from crucifying my own father, with the other half trying to prove that I did, in fact, crucify my own father. To be honest, the ladder has got a pretty good case here. My father and I didn't get along very well, which is why I moved to Switzerland. Kind of estranged if you will. Then there's obviously the money side of things. He left me in charge of the business, so that alone makes me a billionaire. All of these things would make sense. Except for the fact that of course I didn't CRUCIFY my own father. The process would take days, who has time for that anyway. If I was gonna kill someone it would be in a much more effective manner. Like with a knife or a shotgun. Anyway, the lawyers keep bickering and I've quite enough of the chatter. Besides, this is ridiculous, there's no need to-**

**‚ÄúThen why have we found his blood at the scene of the crime?‚Äù one of the lawyers smirks and sits back.**¬†

**My lawyers talk to each other and bicker for a moment.**¬†

**‚ÄúIm sorry, how could my blood have been there if I wasn't there?‚Äù I ask as my lawyer grabs my arm.**¬†

**‚ÄúI don't know, you tell me,‚Äù the lawyer gives me the smuggest look I've ever seen as my lawyers keep frantically trying to defend me. It's clear to me that I've been set up, probably by the Anti-Christ, or someone else who hates my family. Either way it's not looking very good for me at the moment.**

**Chapter 18**¬†

**Logan Bruno**

**Oh man, this is not good. That is not the Anti-Christ. We actively have a superhero in custody right now. And most worryingly, Evan seems to be against me on this. I mean technically he's right, who would believe me? But still, I just can't believe it. I gotta get out of the station. So I'm walking down the road, on the way to my favorite coffee shop, when I catch the eyes of the prettiest woman I've ever seen. Woah, I wish I had the guts to talk to her. Oh well. I walk into the coffee shop and sit at the bar. ‚ÄúIll have the usual,‚Äù (Tucker knows I like it with tons of sugar) I say as I wave to Tucker behind the bar.**¬†

**‚ÄúHello!‚Äù**

**I turn around, its the woman from the street.**¬†

**‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶hello, how can I help you?‚Äù I move back in my seat.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell I just saw you on the street and wanted to ask you out for some coffee! And, well, here we are!‚Äù The woman sits next to me. She waves to Tucker. ‚ÄúIll have my coffee black please!‚Äù She turns to me, ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre a cop?‚Äù**¬†

**I look at my badge on my uniform. Oh yeah, forgot I was wearing that.**¬†

**‚ÄúOh yes mam, I am actually a detective,‚Äù I say as I grab my coffee from Tucker.**

**‚ÄúI dated a cop once, it didn't work out,‚Äù the girl looks down and sighs.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhy didn't it work out?‚Äù I ask.**¬†

**‚ÄúHe died a couple of years ago,‚Äù she tears up a little bit.**¬†

**‚ÄúI'm sorry,‚Äù I sip my coffee. This woman is beautiful but why is she talking to me?**¬†

**‚ÄúShiela,‚Äù she says as she gets her coffee, ""that's my name. I wanted to know if you wanted to go to dinner sometime? Like an official date?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúSure, that would be amazing,‚Äù I look up at her and write my phone number on a napkin.**¬†

**‚ÄúHere. Listen, I gotta go, it's really busy at the station,‚Äù I get up to leave.**¬†

**‚ÄúOh yeah, I heard you caught the Anti-Christ! That's amazing!‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶right,‚Äù I look at her as I open the door and walk out.**¬†

today I feel like I made a huge mistake with regards to this. Because a, and b are very bad and c is my close friend. And in the beginning a and b used to despise c and used to be like dont hangout with him and etc but I made him come and hangout with us because c used to be on his own and not hangout with anyone, I just didnt like it when people are on their own.

So moving on im in year 3 right now and since 2nd year, a and b are close and they would leave me alone and go sit by themselves behind and not call me back with them, I felt this was odd because they would always call me and slowly slowly as time went by they started drifting apart. This was very strange. Year 2 finally got over and it‚Äôs year 3 now and it‚Äôs been a month and I shifted my place and im sitting on my own now.

in year 2 A asked me to sell something which is precious to me and give him money, I felt this was kinda extreme because if he wanted money he could‚Äôve asked me but asking me to sell something which is important to me just for him? No way!

And after a while that precious thing was sold because of my financial difficulties I was facing. So since then I started believing in evil eye.

and a and b used to make jokes about me having this thing like, sell it, why do u have It, how come ur dad gave it to you, and etc so one day I snapped at B not once but many times.

and like I said I shifted my place a month ago and I feel at peace but at the beginning I used to suggest these fine dinning places for lunch hand etc thinking we would split the bill together but I was wrong, b couldn‚Äôt afford it and a and c were not that strong money wise, neither was I. So I just adjusted and went with the flow. And hangout at a local eatery.

and he says that I am very egotistical and I only show off and etc.  
look I believe in eating good will make me be healthy. By eating at the place where I used to adjust, I got gastric.  
Was it really worth it? Now I regret it. And the other day they said we will go to the local eatery but I said no let‚Äôs go here because I wanted coffee, and he commented on that saying see bro he has money and etc. basically calling me a¬†¬†**Show-off**,¬†**FlashyPretentious, Braggart Ostentatious. Flamboyant**¬†,¬†**New money, Materialistic**¬†who even does that? Because the local eatery does not serve COFFEE. just because of these incidents. theyre dragging my name down, end of the day it doesn't matter to me but it does affect me to some extent.

Some movies that disturbed me and I liked are: (of course Jacob‚Äôs ladder/red rooms/saint maud) climax(2018), hereditary(2018), don‚Äôt look now(1973), fresh(2022), maniac(both from 1980 and 2012), requiem for a dream, the coffee table and martyrs. 

It‚Äôs hard to explain what exactly I mean. I don‚Äôt want something that‚Äôs just shocking and disturbing just to be shocking and disturbing. I don‚Äôt usually love exploitation films but obvi i think that some that I like would be considered that. I think it just gets to a point where it‚Äôs too much for me with something like Megan is missing. 


And I‚Äôm not exactly sure what it is about things like Jacob‚Äôs ladder/red rooms/saint maud that I like. They shocked/disturbed me as well but they seemed to more so have a point rather than just feeling gross and distasteful. I don‚Äôt usually like things that are just straight up torture. I did like martyrs though but that‚Äôs an exception. 

I would prefer movies from the 70s/80s but okay with any year. 

Not sure if any of this made sense but if anyone has any suggestions I‚Äôd appreciate it! I‚Äôm still trying to finish my 31 days of October movie list lmao

edit: also i just want to say that im not trying to diss movies like human centipede and cannibal holocaust and stuff like that. I just personally dont like them. ",0,1759776599.0,MovieSuggestions,13,0.5,False

I've been using Comet to automate my life for a while now, here's one of the ways you can use it too.

# DO GROCERY SHOPPING WITH ONE CLICK

**Wow Effect:** Wow **Time Needed:** 9 min **Time Saved:** 60 min

I built a reusable shortcut that takes dish names (""lasagna,"" ""butter chicken"") and does the rest:

* finds reliable recipes
* extracts the ingredients
* skips my pantry staples
* hunts down discounted organic products
* adds them all to my cart
* schedules next-day delivery
* calculates savings I made
* pastes the recipe I should use

**All of that from 1 click!**

Even better - I live in Denmark, the shopping site was in Danish, so Comet had to translate everything real-time. And it did, without missing a beat. Handling a language that's, well...far from the world's most widely spoken üòÄ

The **effort‚Äëto‚Äëresults ratio is mind-blowing.** Even with a personal shopping assistant, re‚Äëexplaining over text would take longer than one click in Comet. It's the most satisfying kind of automation: zero friction, fully personalized, and built for real life.

The prompt is below, just swap in your store's name and your preferences to make it your own:

There're so many other cool things you can do with Comet (and Perplexity in general), you're welcome [copy some of mine from Substack](https://karozieminski.substack.com/p/perplexity-comet-advanced-use-cases-guide), but honestly you can just try things on your own! I'm sure you'll come up with some great examples tooü§ó

One thing I‚Äôve found very useful is this: when Comet does something that saves you time, ask it to summarize the steps it took to get there. Then, ask it to help you build a reusable prompt so you can repeat those steps in the future. Save these prompts as shortcuts, and you‚Äôre on your way to building your own personal OS.

My husband and I are both coffee lovers, our current setup is V60 pourer with the occasional Chemex, I've already gotten him a siphon brewer for a different special occasion gift, we have some nice thermoses and mugs for drinking.
We have preordered the Fellow espresso machine- he has taken charge of researching grinders, cups, etc. (those seem to be the two accessories he's most excited for).


He's wanted an espresso machine for YEARS and so I'm thinking about getting him some accessories for Christmas- but not sure what would be the most useful/most exciting things to order.


Right now my best idea is creating a name and logo for our own 'coffee shop' (a play on our last name) and getting cups, a hat, perhaps a tamper with that logo on it to make our own 'cafe.'

1nzrlkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Truckers/comments/1nzrlkg/an_early_team_driving_story/,An early Team driving story,"Preston and I had been driving a truck for only a few weeks. We weren't even close to settling into any type of routine. We were still trying to figure out what we were even doing. That was ten years ago. Much has changed since then.

  To understand this part of the story, we have to go back a little bit. It is, after all, the most unlikely of circumstances that led us here. Initally, we worked together in self-storage. I'm not trying to brag, but we outperformed in every metric as a team. This led to a quick promotion to manager of a nearby property for Preston. It wasn't long before his youth and enthusiasm was on the brink of being snuffed out by the relentless pursuit of corporate capitalism. It simply wasn't meant to be.

  Many months later, as life is often want to do, inexplicably our paths crossed once again. I drove to Spokane where Preston had relocated to and we made the trip back to Phoenix. It was supposed to be just a short period of time, maybe a few weeks, but it ended up being months. 

  In the interim, I had changed jobs to a different storage facility. But I was restless after ten years of working in self-storage. It had been good for me, especially the on-site residence part, but it was honestly a soul destroying job.

  While Preston had been gone for those months, I had shopped around a few truck driving schools. I had virtually decided on the one I wanted to attend and was just working over the logistics in my head prior to making the giant career change. Understand that to do this and quit my job, I was also giving up my free housing and free utilities. It was a bit overwhelming considering all the moving parts. 

  Preston noticed all the truck driving school literature on my coffee table one night. ""what's all this?"" He asked.  I explained that I was seriously considering jumping ship and going to truck driving school and going over the road driving. To say he was absolutely unimpressed, would be the understatement of the decade. 

  What kind of hillbilly, backwoods, redneck BS are you even talking about? Paraphrasing, but he thought it was one of the dumbest things he'd ever heard. 

Over the next few days and weeks we talked about it here and there. The idea of team driving came up. Primarily how potentially lucrative it could be. I could tell he was curious, but absolutely remained unconvinced.  Ultimately, we went to visit the school together and the next thing we knew, we were enrolled in school.

  I'm going to skip over the in between for now because it's not relevant to this story. Have faith, we're definitely coming back to it because it's a story all by itself.

  Okay, so we were maybe a few weeks in. We had picked up in SoCal, which became our routine. I'm pretty sure we were heading to Atlanta or thereabouts. Preston was driving and I was learning how to sleep in a truck sleeper berth while roaring down the road in 80,000 lbs of semi truck, trailer and cargo. Definitely a learned skill.

  I woke up and it's a bit before the end of Prestons driving shift and the end of my sleeper shift. We were stopped and parked. The sleeper curtains were closed.  I woke up, took a few minutes to get my bearings, looked at Google Maps on my phone to see where we are. That's something that is kind of fun, definitely interesting, but that you never really get used to as a team truck driver. Every time you wake up, you're someplace else. 

  I think it's around 7 am. I get fully awake and I open the sleeper curtains. I fully expect Preston to be in the driver seat. Or certainly at least in the cab. (He developed a technique to take naps across the front seats in the cab, something I never was able to do.) But, no one is there. I think maybe he's gone for a walk. It's a small rest area on I-20 in West Texas. No facilities, just parking. I'm thinking to myself that he can't be far, there's nothing around us. I grab my phone to call him. There's no cell service. Oh hell.

  I sit in the drivers seat considering the situation. There's not even restrooms here. Nothing. There's a few other trucks but the idea that he might have gone to one of them is ridiculous. I'm trying to think of anything that makes any sense. Where would he even go? Why would he leave the truck. How would I find him if he did. Every new thing I thought of was more confusing than the last.

  Finally the thought occurs to me that were only around 150 miles from the border with Mexico. As ridiculous as it might sound now, could he have been kidnapped? I mean there's no logical explanation for why he's not in the truck, so I suppose it could be possible. Anything could be at this point.  I actually feel my pulse rate quicken enough to be noticeable. I can't call the police, there's no cell service. I can't call anyone in his family. I can't call him. I'm really starting to stress out a bit. What in the hell is going on. Where could he have gone? And why? Nothing made sense.

  Finally I think, he never really wanted to do this. He had reached his limit and just said fuck this and decided to just call it done. He could have easily caught a ride with someone. Maybe he hitchhiked his way down the road. Sure, now that I know Preston, that seems absurd. In the moment? It's what made the most sense.

 I should go to where I have cell signal or to a payphone and call him. Or call his family. But if I leave and he is somewhere close by, I will have left him stranded. WTF? What do I even do? How do I explain to his family if he is actually missing or something? How do I explain to our company? What am I supposed to do now?

  ""What up yo?"" From behind me. On the top bunk of the sleeper. I'd never even considered it. He got tired and crawled up on the top bunk for a nap!  Holy shit do I ever feel like an idiot. Relieved, but still an idiot. How could I have missed something so plainly obvious.

I took a sip of my latte, feeling the warmth seep into my bones as I tried to shake off the memories of yesterday's confrontation.  
  
You see, Emma had always been the thorn in my side. From high school to our adult years, she had made it her mission to outshine me in every aspect of life. Her jealousy was palpable, her passive-aggressive jabs cutting deep, but I had always managed to rise above it.  
  
However, yesterday was different. As I walked into the charity event, I couldn't help but notice Emma's eyes boring into me from across the room. The tension was thick, the unspoken rivalry simmering just below the surface. And then it happened.  
  
In front of a room full of our peers, Emma launched into a scathing tirade, accusing me of stealing her ideas and sabotaging her career. The shock was palpable, the accusations baseless, but the damage was done. As I stood there, at a loss for words, I realized that this was my breaking point.  
  
But just as I was about to walk away, a familiar voice spoke up from the back of the room. It was Alex, my old college friend and Emma's ex-boyfriend. With a twinkle in his eye, he revealed a secret that would change everything ‚Äì Emma had been the one stealing my ideas all along, trying to tear me down out of sheer envy.  
  
The room fell silent as the truth sank in. Emma's facade crumbled before my eyes, her mask of perfection slipping away to reveal the insecure girl beneath. And as I looked around at the shocked faces, I couldn't help but feel a sense of liberation wash over me.  
  
So here I am, sipping my latte in the heart of the city, embracing the newfound freedom that comes with letting go of toxic relationships. As I take another sip, I can't help but wonder ‚Äì what do you think about my story? Have you ever had to deal with a frenemy like Emma? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

3. **Seat depth check:** There should be a 2‚Äì3 finger gap behind your knees when sitting back.  
4. **Adjust lumbar support** ‚Äî The curve should align with your lower back‚Äôs natural curve.  
5. **Take micro-breaks** ‚Äî Every 30‚Äì45 minutes, stand up, roll your shoulders, stretch for 30 seconds.  
6. **Sit back fully** ‚Äî Don‚Äôt perch at the front of your seat. Let the chair do the work.  
7. **Support your feet** ‚Äî If your feet don‚Äôt reach the ground, use a small box, book, or footrest.  
8. **Keep wrists neutral** ‚Äî No bending up or down while typing; raise your chair or keyboard if needed.  
9. **Fix lighting** ‚Äî Avoid glare. Position your monitor perpendicular to windows or light sources.  
10. **Declutter your desk** ‚Äî Keep essentials within easy reach to prevent constant leaning or twisting.

Should we break up or continue until a common ground? It's a long story.,"Hello. (Most of gramatical errors. - English its not my native language)

We are in a relation for exactly 5 years (10.10.2020 was the date we both become lovers). I was 21 at that time, she was 20. I was in IT university while working on a 4 hour job after the pandemic, she was in a long term university which she finished this year.   
  
It start in July 2020. At the beginning we were friends, I was single and she was in a relation with a ""toxic man"" (Both we have the same perspective about that man). We went with a small group of friends to visit the sea, at that time she was still with his Marco (Not his real name) but because Marco had not job and money, he didn't come with the rest of us. We were 8 people, 3 couples, me and her. Because those 3 couples took a room for themselves, my and my (actual) gf had to stay in the same room, different beds. We started knowing each other, sharing moments, realizing we have stuff in common,etc. After 7 days we went back to our homes, and that was the moment when she felt in love with me. I was a nice person (and i\`m still a nice person). Because she felt in love with me, the next 3 months (July - Sept) were .. though. She wanted to be with me, but she was still with Marco. She went outside with him, and then with me, and vice-versa. We went to a party somewhere in August (all of us, me, her and Marco) and after several hours, she broke with him. They discussed the next day, and after that I received a message like ""Lets do not discuss anymore - from her"". 3 weeks later, they broke up for real (this was in mid september). There are a lot more, but I did some kind of resume (We visit some of her friends, she kissed me first, night drives, we slept in the same bad at another party where Marco was absent but we did nothing, just slept, no sex). After that we discussed through messages, and both we still wanted to be together.

On oct 2020, I went to her university city and asked her if she wants to be in a relation with me. All good until here. I still had the same 4-hour job which went to be shity job and I couldnt handle it anymore.   
So somewhere in April 2021 I received an offer as Junior Developer (1200$ month net). After I went into this new job, some months later I wanted a Car and I moved in a rent 1-room apartment (not in the same city with here because I had job in another city and university aswell). After I had a rent in october and a Car in november, I started to commute between cities (2 hours) to see her and visit her for 1 week (Sunday to Sunday). 

(Yes i\`m idiot, you\`ll see).  
Because I like to play videogames, everytime I went in university city (Where she was), instead of spending time together at night, sometimes I went on my laptop to play with my friends. Although I asked her if its ok If I stay until midnight to play,she said ""OK"" (It was not like that). And I did this 3 out of 7 days, but my mind was at computer rather than at her.   
  
Somewhere on July 2021 I left my rent, moved back to my parents village, at 30km between me and Work/GF. I started to involve more at my IT job because I wanted to learn things, I started make friends at that job. I spent more time at Job (9-5) and less on discord with her :( ... I was still a kid tho at 22 yo I wanted to have fun :(.  I keep it like that for several months. Then we discussed, then I dropped my friends because ""I thought they are the problem - i\`m spending to much time with them"". After several months (oct 2021) It was only me and her.   
I bought a car in oct 2021 and everything was ok until next summer 2022.

Somwhere in June 2022 we encountered other problems. Because I didn;t know to choose a ""good car"" .. I had a ""junk one"" which over time it became annoying to have it. I had to wait 5 minutes to heat the engine, I had to avoid some roads because it was a lower card and street had a lot of potholes. Ok. Because most of the time I was exhausted from work and most of the time, I went outside with her (in the natal city) around 7pm, managed to reach home at 1AM, I spent around 300$ per months in Gas + car repairs, and because I didnt had time, 3 days in a row I went outside unwashed because 9-17 job, 17 outside, come back at mid night ... I wanted to sleep. And yes, I didnt had hot water in my parents village :( so it was a bit hard to do a shower  


We keep it like that until Sept 2022 where we had the first arguments. She will go back to university (because on summer she was in the same near city where i had work) She wanted to spent her last 10 days with me, but because I was too tired and too ""junky"", i asked her if I can stay at home on Monday because I need to wash my laundries, wash myself, prepare some food, etc. And we had a verbal fight (light verbal fight) which almost make both of us break the relationship. After we both reached home ,we went discord, we discussed that ""I\`m asking for 1 day"". She understanded and we continued like before, no breakup.

We continued until January 2023 when she asked for a ""pause"". I didn't know what a Pause means, I asked friends, most said that a Pause = 99% break up. She break up with me, 2 weeks later we were back.  
On April 2024 we had a chat and I couldn't handle it anymore, so I called her and told that we want to break up (She was 1 day before an exam). After 2 hours she called me and told me that she is drunk and we had a discussion where I was the jerk (Agree) then we went back together (Meanwhile, after I broke with her at 10am, at 1 pm I left with some friends because I wanted to forget about this). After that, that chat, I took the car and went to her university city to stay with her.  
At the end of May, I asked her where we go this summer and she said that she doesnt want anymore to be in a relation because of my ""toxic trait"". After 3 hours of discussion I realized that I have some unknown problems and I went to psychology for 3 sessions. I realized that I was toxic with her and after that I asked for one more chance. I promised to her that i\`ll change.

On oct 2023 I had to move in another city because of a New job. I didnt used the car anymore, i commute with Train. I went to her 1-2 weeks per month. I had a remote job. Since June 2023 until last week everything was ""fine"" lets say. We didnt had any other fight, she didnt cried anymore, i changed myself (sincerely).  
  
On July 2024 we took the decision to move together. It was her parents apartment in the university city. So they agreed with this. After we moved together, (I think) our relation went ok although she didn't had time at all because of University (from 6 am until 4 pm) and then a shitty job (from 4 pm to 8 pm but most of the time it ends at midnight) .. so we started for 3 months to spent less time. I was at home, cooking, cleaning, doing household stuff while she was at university and at work. I went to take her from work with car when outside was cold, etc. I was supportive (I guess).  
  
On Nov 2024 she left the job. Since Nov 2024 we stayed in the same house, same room for 7 months. We had the same computers in the same room, played same games, same discord server and friends, etc. Meanwhile we had trips, went to eat junky food, visit parents. Everything was ok.  
  
On April 2025 I asked her if she wants to engaged with me.  
  
On June 2025 we moved in separate rooms because she wanted to be focused on study (because its last year at medicine) and because I had meetings at work and she couldn't focus.  
  
Since June 2025 until 1 week ago, we stayed in separate rooms, but we watched movies together, cooking together, eating, spending less time outside, etc. Last week she went at coffee with a girl Monica, they discussed about some group problems and about the relationship Monica have. That moment, Monica said something like ""You should search for your love"" (or something like this - those words I heard from my GF). 3 Days after coffee, my GF said ""I\`m thinking to broke up"" and I asked why, and the answer was ""I don't receive enough affection like gentle caresses, playing with her hair, spending time together (Although in the last 3 months there was no time because she was focusing with Study).  
  
We discussed, and we agreed that breaking up with someone without a clear reason its weird. I mean, I didnt fight with her, never used bad words, always supportive, always helping her with university . But her reason was that she did not received enough affection. I said that this can change, I didnt received it because most of the time when I come into your room to see how are you, you were focusing and I didnt wanted to intrerupt - tho she suggested that I should have tried to see what happen :|.

She went to psihologist this evening, and the psihologist suggested to ""have a break for a while"" (not sure how much). We will stay together in the same apartment until she have the final exam (18 of Nov). After that I have to move my stuff to my parent village, **and leave her for X time without any contact (Her request)**. 

So the questions are.. how do you see this situation? What is a ""pause"" and does it help? Is there any hope? Any next steps?

PS: We had plans to move together after she finish her exam in a new city. Her parents will sell this apartament and we do 50-50 for a new one. Well at least this was the plan, rn idk.., I bought a lot of stuff in this apartament for both of us, and now (maybe) we will have to split them apart.

PS2: I still want to be with this girl. I dont know if its just the fact that i\`m scared to lose here or because I see someone to have a future with (Although I feel its the 2nd one). I tried to fix stuff always. 

PS3: I\`m a mechanical guy, she is an affective girl. Most of my ""love signs"" are actions - mechanical actions (Cooking food, clean the house, etc)

PS4: I didnt put all the informations here, I might miss some of them and most probably those are key-factors. Ask anything which can help both (me and you - the one who offer me help).",1,1759776065.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

1nzrcr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1nzrcr8/my_experience_resultsside_effects/,My experience results/side effects,"I wanted to share my experience on mounjaro for anyone who‚Äôs unsure about starting or maybe needs a little motivation to keep going.

Start weight 14 stone 11lb may 2025 
Current weight 11 stone 

When I started my only side effect was diahreah for the first 2 weeks. After that for month I suffered bad constipation. Suppository‚Äôs and dioralite were my best friend ! I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using them to help with constipation though as I become dependent on them for a while. I‚Äôm back regular now and really only suffer if I eat fatty meals. 
I‚Äôm not a coffee drinker but I swear by a coffee in a morning now and that has helped me be more regular! 

After my first month on 2.5 and having big losses the first 3 weeks I moved upto 5mg after not seeing the results I was used to in the fourth week. DONT DO IT! 

Stay on 2.5 as long as you can because really upping my dose made no difference to the results on the scale. If it gives you suppression stay at that dose. I regret not sticking at it longer. I‚Äôm still on 5mg into my sixth month and I average 2lb a week. Which I‚Äôm so happy with and will continue on 5mg until I‚Äôm at my goal and from there will maintain on a lower dose. 

For my biggest side effect (not directly caused by mounjaro) but from my own stupidity. Hair loss. This past month I‚Äôve seen my hair thin drastically. When I brush clumps coming out at each stroke. This is due to the rapid weight loss but also because I didn‚Äôt listen. When people told me to take supplements or make sure to be hitting my protein goals. I genuinely thought it wouldn‚Äôt effect my hair like it has. 
It takes 3 months to notice a change in your hair when trauma has effected it. It has gotten to me but what falls out will grow back and I‚Äôm hopeful on that. Now adding supplements to my daily routine aswell as adding more protein. ü§ûüèª


I have pcos , underactive thyroid, prolactinoma and also hs. My periods were non existent for 7/8 years. After a month in mounjaro I got my first and let me tell you I was so happy to have the back/tummy pain back üòÇ I‚Äôm now regular!! This is the biggest pro for me and I know a lot of women suffer with pcos, mounjaro is a game changer for sure! 

Anyone with hs this info is for you. Some people are different but for me mounjaro has accelerated my flairs. Im pretty sure its the hormone changes and hopefully it will settle but the amount of active flairs I have compared to pre mounjaro is insane. I‚Äôd say I was stage 1 before mj and im now stage 2. It is really bad and painful and you know the ones that flair and never leave always tender . Yeah thats the ones üò© 

I‚Äôm waiting on blood results to see how it‚Äôs effected my thyroid and prolactin levels ü§ûüèª I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs good! I know mj levels out insulin levels so I‚Äôm hopeful I‚Äôm no longer pre diabetic too. 


Even with the hair loss and my flares being bad. I would do it all again. I feel so much healthier, confident and my relationship is the best it has been for years. I know my confidence, low libido and just lack of interest was effecting it but feel like it‚Äôs changed me for the better üôÇ

Best decision I ever made for myself! 

I plan on getting into the the 9 stones. I‚Äôm only 5ft1 and the recommended is 7 1/2 to 9stone. 9 stone will do me fine! 

If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Also any advice with hair loss, hs flares PLEASE drop your recs below. 

Here are some of my go to meals for anyone that struggles. I know myself having appetite suppression I just didn‚Äôt fancy but here are some easy meals. (I‚Äôm a picky eater don‚Äôt judge üòÜ)

Lunch
Poached eggs on toast, I add cheese sauce if I want to add some calories plus it tastes so good. Sometimes bacon too or ham.

Egg mayo on cracker bread üòã

Chicken wraps üò©

Ham salad on thins or gen lettuce 

Breakfast omelette oven baked! This is so good, eggs, ham, peppers, onion and cheese mix and place in a small oven proof dish. You can cook how you like but this some how tastes so much better 

Chicken and halloumi salad 


Dinner
Chilli and garlic chicken noodles with tender stem broccoli 

Steak, mushrooms , onion rings with Aldi grill fry‚Äôs 

Tomato and cheese pasta (calorific but tasty) Aldi do a cheese roule the garlic and herb oneüòã I‚Äôd bulk make this and sometimes have left overs for lunch

Beef and halloumi burgers I would leave out the bread most times. Eat with a side of Lidl cheese coleslaw because it‚Äôs the best and some grill fry‚Äôs 

Halloumi, chicken , peppers kebabs seasoned with Coleman‚Äôs gyro flavour pack ü§åüèª

Tandoori chicken flat breads with mint yogurt ! 

Those are my favourites ! 

Some snacks I would have also because I‚Äôm like a child and don‚Äôt eat fruit üò¨

Pepperoni sticks great to add a bit of protein 
Aldis chocolate rice cakes 
Aldis chocolate protein shakes üòç
Aldis chocolate protein yogurts 
Obviously doesn‚Äôt have to be chocolate but I love chocolate üòÇ

Crackers with allioli spread ! (Do it) get it from home bargains it‚Äôs so good. You‚Äôll drink to high heaven but it‚Äôs worth it üòÇ

Any meal suggestions or snacks you have for me to try please let me know I tend to eat the same thing so would love to know your go to! 



So yeah if your thinking about starting mj go for it. Do a little research on what vitamins and supplements to take. Drink plenty of water and eat your protein and fiber ! Don‚Äôt get addicted to suppository‚Äôs just drink some coffee ! 

I will one day share my before and after pics when I‚Äôm at my goal weight. 

Thanks for reading, if you made it this far drop a üëπ to start your reply üòÇ

I know I have‚Äîback when I was hustling as a solo sales rep, I'd spend hours manually updating CRM notes after every call, only to watch deals fizzle out because I missed a follow-up. Sound familiar? If you're in sales or marketing, you're not alone. In 2025, the game has changed thanks to AI automation, workflow efficiency, and smart integrations that turn chaos into closed deals.

In this post, we're diving into the **top sales and marketing tools for 2025**‚Äîthe ones that focus on AI-powered efficiency to help you prospect smarter, nurture leads faster, and scale without the burnout. I'll break down standout picks like HubSpot, Zoho CRM, and LinkedIn Sales Navigator, plus a few game-changers for marketing pros. Whether you're a startup hustler or leading a team, these insights are pulled from real-user feedback and expert reviews to help you pick winners. Let's get your pipeline pumping!

# Why AI Automation is the Future of Sales and Marketing Success

Picture this: It's Friday afternoon, and instead of sifting through email threads for that one prospect's pain point, an AI tool summarizes your last call, scores the lead's buy-readiness, and drafts a personalized follow-up‚Äîall in seconds. That's the magic of **AI sales automation** in 2025. Tools aren't just digitizing old processes anymore; they're predicting outcomes, automating grunt work, and integrating seamlessly with your stack to boost workflow efficiency.

According to recent trends, sales teams using AI see up to 46% higher productivity by cutting manual data entry. Marketing folks? They're leveraging these for hyper-targeted campaigns that feel personal, not pushy. The key? Tools that prioritize integration‚Äîthink CRM syncing with email and social without a hitch. But not all shine equally. That's where our picks come in, evaluated on real-world impact.

# Our Top Picks: Essential Sales Tools for Prospecting and Pipeline Management

Let's start with the heavy hitters in sales. These **best sales software** options emphasize targeted lead gen, automation, and that B2B edge you need to stand out.

# HubSpot Sales Hub: The All-in-One Powerhouse for Growing Teams

HubSpot isn't just a CRM‚Äîit's your friendly neighborhood AI sidekick. With features like predictive lead scoring and conversation intelligence (think auto-transcribed calls with sentiment analysis), it turns raw data into actionable insights. I once helped a buddy's e-comm team integrate it with their email flows; within a month, their close rates jumped 25% because reps focused on high-potential leads instead of guesswork.

Key perks:

* AI assistants for email drafting and report gen.
* Seamless pipeline tracking with visual boards.
* Free tier for starters, scales with integrations like Zapier.

If you're ditching spreadsheets, this is your entry to pro-level efficiency.

# Zoho CRM: Affordable Automation for Agile Businesses

Zoho keeps it simple yet mighty, with drag-and-drop automation for workflows and AI-driven analytics that spot trends before they blow up. It's a fave for small-to-mid teams because it handles everything from lead nurturing to sales forecasting without breaking the bank. Relatable scenario: Imagine auto-tagging inbound queries by urgency‚Äîsuddenly, your hot leads aren't cooling off in the inbox.

Standout features:

* Customizable dashboards for pipeline views.
* Multi-channel support (email, social, phone).
* Strong mobile app for on-the-go reps.

Pro tip: Pair it with Zoho's own marketing suite for end-to-end funnels.

# LinkedIn Sales Navigator: Your B2B Lead Goldmine

Nothing beats LinkedIn for targeted **B2B lead search** in 2025. Sales Navigator uses AI to recommend leads based on your wins, plus real-time alerts for job changes or company news. It's like having a network of 1B+ pros at your fingertips. I remember using it to snag a coffee chat with a dream client after spotting their funding round‚Äîclosed the deal two weeks later.

Highlights:

* Advanced filters for job titles, industries, and intent signals.
* Smart InMail for icebreakers that actually get replies.
* Integrates with CRMs for effortless data sync.

B2B sellers, this one's non-negotiable.

# PandaDoc: Streamline Docs and Close Deals Faster

Tired of back-and-forth on proposals? PandaDoc automates document creation, e-signatures, and tracking‚Äîright down to who lingers on pricing pages. It's a workflow wizard that integrates with your CRM, slashing approval times. Anecdote time: A marketing agency I consulted for cut proposal cycles from days to hours, landing 15% more gigs just by making signatures a one-click affair.

Why it rocks:

* Template library for reusable sales collateral.
* Analytics on viewer engagement.
* Mobile signing for remote teams.

Perfect for sales docs that wow without the hassle.

# Marketing Must-Haves: Tools to Amplify Your Reach and Conversions

Sales and marketing go hand-in-hand, so let's spotlight tools that supercharge campaigns with AI and data-driven tweaks.

# SEMrush: SEO Mastery for Content That Converts

For marketers, **top marketing tools** like SEMrush are lifesavers. It uncovers keywords, audits sites, and spies on competitors‚Äîall with AI suggestions for content tweaks. In a world where 68% of online experiences start with search, this tool ensures your blog posts or landing pages rank (and rank high).

Quick wins:

* Keyword research with volume and difficulty scores.
* Site audits spotting fixable issues.
* Trend tracking for timely campaigns.

It's like a crystal ball for organic traffic.

# Mailchimp: Email Automation That Feels Personal

Email's still king for nurturing leads, and Mailchimp's AI crafts subject lines and segments lists like a pro. From drip campaigns to A/B tests, it integrates with CRMs for automated follow-ups. Story share: A startup marketer I know used it to revive stale lists, boosting open rates by 40% with zero extra effort.

Essentials:

* Drag-and-drop builders for stunning emails.
* Behavioral triggers for timely sends.
* Analytics dashboard for ROI insights.

Beginner-friendly with pro-level punch.

# Zapier: The Integration Glue for Workflow Efficiency

No list is complete without Zapier, the no-code wizard connecting 5,000+ apps. Automate from lead capture in Google Forms to CRM updates‚Äîsaving hours weekly. It's the unsung hero for hybrid sales-marketing teams juggling tools.

Core strengths:

* ""Zaps"" for if-this-then-that magic.
* Multi-step automations for complex flows.
* Free plan for light users.

Think of it as your team's invisible efficiency booster.

# How We Reviewed These Top Sales and Marketing Tools

Transparency's key here‚Äîour picks aren't random. We evaluated based on:

* **Core Features:** AI depth, automation ease, and integration options (e.g., CRM compatibility).
* **User Feedback:** Pulled from sites like G2 and Capterra, focusing on 2025 ratings for real-user wins.

# Side-by-Side Showdown: Comparing Top CRMs for Sales Teams

To make choices easier, here's a quick comparative table of three CRM standouts. It highlights key differences in automation, pricing tiers (entry-level focus), and ideal use cases.

|Tool|AI Automation Strength|Integration Depth|Best For|Entry Cost (per user/mo)|User Rating (out of 5)|

Here‚Äôs why.,"final destination 2 is one of those movies that people hype up because of the highway scene, but if you look past that, it‚Äôs a total mess. david r. ellis directs like he‚Äôs still thinking in stunt reels instead of scenes. everything feels flat and chaotic at once. there‚Äôs no rhythm, no build-up, just loud accidents edited together with no sense of timing. the camera doesn‚Äôt linger, it just cuts. and because of that, nothing ever lands. the deaths don‚Äôt feel suspenseful or clever, they just happen. the movie never breathes long enough for you to care about anyone or even feel that quiet dread the first film nailed. it‚Äôs all noise and splatter with no pulse behind it.

the first final destination was weirdly elegant. james wong knew how to hold tension in silence, how to make a mug of coffee or a gust of wind feel dangerous. it had this eerie patience, like a nightmare you can‚Äôt wake from. even the third film understood that. the tanning bed sequence is artfully cruel, shot with purpose, every movement deliberate. same with bloodlines- which actually has visual intention. the pacing, the tone, the way the deaths feel connected to who the characters are. in 2, none of that exists. it‚Äôs like ellis watched the first film and thought the secret was ‚Äúmore crashes, more gore.‚Äù

what makes it worse is how sloppy it all feels. the acting‚Äôs cartoonish, the dialogue sounds like it was written during a lunch break, and the editing has zero sense of tension. the camera constantly moves but never says anything. the kills are big, sure, but they mean nothing. the movie doesn‚Äôt understand irony, it doesn‚Äôt understand tone, it doesn‚Äôt even understand death as an idea. it‚Äôs just a highlight reel with a studio budget. final destination 2 might have shocked people in 2003, but watch it again now and you see it for what it is: empty spectacle made by someone who didn‚Äôt get what made the original terrifying.",0,1759775560.0,FinalDestination,4,0.16,False

The doorbell rings, and friends have stopped by for a spontaneous visit. You‚Äôre happy to see them, but as a host, your mind races: ""What can I offer them?"" The kitchen counter, with its packets of snacks and scattered items, suddenly feels miles away from the graceful welcome you want to give.

From my experience, the difference between a flustered host and a poised one often comes down to a single, simple tool: a high-quality Wooden Serving Tray. This isn't just about carrying things. It's about mastering the art of instant hospitality and making your guests feel truly valued from the moment they arrive.

# From Clutter to Classy: The One-Minute Transformation

The power of a serving tray lies in its ability to create order and beauty out of chaos. It acts as a frame for your offerings. This simple pivot from carrying individual items to presenting a curated collection on a [**Serving Tray for Guests**](https://duskylory.store/collections/dry-fruit-tray-and-box) instantly communicates a message of intentional hospitality.

Even if you assembled it in seconds, the final presentation looks thoughtful and deliberate. This is a core principle of great hosting: it‚Äôs about making your guests feel comfortable and cared for, and a well-presented tray is a clear, non-verbal signal of that care.

# The Expert's Guide to Assembling the Perfect Tray

Building an appealing tray is a skill, and like any skill, it‚Äôs easy once you know the formula. As professional event stylists will tell you, balance is everything. Think in terms of flavor, texture, and visual appeal.

1. **Establish an Anchor:** Start with one or two small bowls or ramekins. This adds height and structure. Use them to hold your premium Dry Fruit selection‚Äîthink pistachios, cashews, or dried apricots. They provide a focal point for the eye.
2. **Balance Sweet and Savory:** Every great platter has contrast. Next to the nutty flavors of the dry fruit, arrange a neat stack of savory biscuits or crackers. On another part of the tray, add a sweet element, like dark chocolate squares or shortbread cookies.
3. **Introduce Varied Textures:** This is where you elevate your presentation from good to great. Add a small bunch of grapes for a soft, juicy texture. Include a handful of crunchy, savory snacks like baked crisps. Perhaps add a wedge of soft cheese. The variety makes the tray more engaging and satisfying.
4. **Arrange with Purpose:** Don't just place items randomly. Create distinct zones on the tray. A well-crafted Wooden Serving Tray gives you the perfect backdrop; use the space wisely to make each item look its best.

# Why the Right Wood Matters: More Than Just a Pretty Face

While any tray is useful, choosing a wooden one is a mark of expertise. Wood offers a unique combination of durability, beauty, and warmth that other materials lack.

* **Acacia and Mango Wood:** These are popular, excellent choices. They are known for their rich, beautiful grain patterns and are incredibly durable, resisting scratches and wear. As a bonus, they are often sourced from sustainable farms.
* **Teak Wood:** Considered a premium choice, teak is naturally high in oils, making it resistant to moisture and bacteria. A teak Serving Tray for Guests is a long-term investment in quality.

A key benefit, which builds immense trust, is that a quality wooden tray acts as a protective barrier for your furniture, preventing water rings and scratches.

# Care and Longevity: Protecting Your Investment

A trustworthy source will always tell you how to care for your products. A wooden tray is a piece you can own for decades if you treat it right.

* **Cleaning:** Never submerge your tray in water or put it in the dishwasher. Wood is porous and will warp. Simply wipe it clean with a damp cloth and a mild soap, then dry it immediately.
* **Maintenance:** To keep the wood from drying out and cracking, occasionally treat it with a food-grade mineral oil. Just apply a light coat with a soft cloth, let it soak in for a few hours, and wipe off the excess. This expert step will preserve its luster and lifespan.

# Your Shortcut to Gracious Living

Ultimately, a Wooden Serving Tray is more than an accessory; it‚Äôs an indispensable tool for gracious living. It empowers you to be a confident, unhurried host. It brings a touch of natural elegance to your home, whether you're serving guests, enjoying breakfast in bed, or organizing your coffee table. By choosing a quality piece and caring for it, you're not just buying a tray‚Äîyou're investing in a future of warm, welcoming, and effortless hospitality.

1nzr4pf,https://v.redd.it/cyqyf1hp9jtf1,"Secret Crush On You ‚Äî A Wild, Campy Ride That Turns Up the Heat üî•","Secret Crush On You is what happens when a BL embraces its own chaos.  Loud, campy, and unapologetically over the top, yet still manages to bring real heat and heart when it counts.

This show was a wild ride in the best way possible. The first couple of episodes are very campy and Toh‚Äôs character is a lot to take in at first üòÖ However,  the over-the-top energy eventually becomes part of the charm. Episode 1 even kicks off with a Saint cameo üòç Right away the school uniforms had me feeling like I was watching an anime come to life.

But let‚Äôs talk about Nuea and Toh. I was not expecting Nuea to be so intrigued by Toh so quickly, or to get bothered that Toh left his concert early. From there, Nuea turns into the most shameless flirt!  Always finding excuses to touch, tease, and push boundaries. The arm around the shoulder, the neck bite üò≥ And then that car scene where he asks when Toh will give him a piece of his heart while grabbing his butt üòÆ‚Äçüí® Escalating quickly, and I‚Äôm not mad! üòÄ

The chemistry just keeps building. Nuea sneaking onto the bed in his robe and fogging up Toh‚Äôs glasses üî• The fake-out shower scene where Toh gets caught trying to take photos and Nuea teasing him by saying it‚Äôs better to look at the real thing üòè This man‚Äôs flirt game is lethal. And somehow after all that, they still manage to be adorable ü•∞ Pretending to both be asleep and rolling over to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù cuddle ü§≠

The tension finally breaks, and whew. The first ‚Äúreal‚Äù kiss after Nuea says kissing a man is different from kissing a woman had me self-combusting üí• Then that softer follow-up kiss before he runs back for another‚Ä¶ perfection üòå And the coffee or me scene? ü´† First a dream fantasy, then reality, with one of the best fade-outs in BL üòè

Toh thinking he‚Äôs going to top and spiraling about what kind of moans to make was pure gold üíÄ Daisy completely losing it at him only made it funnier ü§£ And the hot-tub scene?! Toh trying to take the initiative leading to both of them tearing a condom wrapper open with their teeth ü´†ü´†ü´† I still can‚Äôt believe they showed that üòÆ‚Äçüí® And Nuea holding it up like a trophy üèÜ Honestly iconic.

The side couples add even more warmth. Sky and Jao are total puppies in love üòç The ‚Äúlover-to-be‚Äù goodnight, the beach confession, the makeout ü•∞ Pure sweetness. Daisy and P‚ÄôTouch had uneven moments but their food stall ‚Äúdate‚Äù was adorable ü•∞ And P‚ÄôTouch saying he‚Äôd be the wife if Daisy asked melted my heart ü•π

Meeting Toh‚Äôs parents was funny and touching, especially Nuea being terrified of Toh‚Äôs dad üòÇ Then when Nuea finds out about Toh‚Äôs obsessive keepsakes leading to his love confession (about how long he‚Äôs really liked Nuea), Nuea says that he‚Äôs just an ordinary guy who loves and wants to be with Toh üò≠ üò≠ üò≠ This scene reminded me of Kiyoi‚Äôs confession in My Beautiful Man ü•π

The finale wraps everything up beautifully when Nuea says they don‚Äôt have secret crushes anymore because now they‚Äôre in love üò≠üò≠üò≠ü•πü•πü•π

**Overall:**Secret Crush On You is campy, messy, ridiculous‚Ä¶ but also unexpectedly hot, endlessly funny, and surprisingly heartfelt. Once you settle into its tone, it rewards you with some of the best teasing, flirting, and payoff kisses with a bit of spice as well üòâ

CNN miraculously ‚Äúobtains‚Äù the infamous Cassie beating video and allegedly sits on it for years like a dragon hoarding gold.

Reality check: This is most likely just overlapping incentives, not an actual signed and sealed plot. Media loves ratings, law enforcement loves optics, and sometimes their calendars magically sync. But wow‚Ä¶ the timing does feel like the kind of conspiracy Netflix would greenlight.

Writing this as I‚Äôm in desperate need of some grounding, advice, perspective or reality checks. I‚Äôll try to keep it as short and to the point as possible.¬†

My partner and I have been together for 9 years. We started dating as roommates back in college, now in our late 20s/early 30s. We‚Äôve shared a significant chunk of our formative years together and have been best friends throughout it all.¬† Last summer, we made a temporary move across the world to a new country (still here).¬†

However, for the majority of our relationship, we have fallen into the classic avoidant-anxious dynamic, with him being the former. I‚Äôve definitely seen my fair share of putting him on a pedestal, treating the relationship like it was my entire world and self-abandonment in many ways, anxiously attaching myself to him. Throughout the 9 years, there‚Äôs been a strong undercurrent of push and pull, of me feeling too much/not enough, and him as well, I think. The past year has been the toughest, I‚Äôve felt very emotionally disconnected from him, our sex life has suffered a lot (over the past 2 years or so, it‚Äôs a tense area for us), and there have been many periods over the years, particualrly the last couple, where I‚Äôve been convinced he was about to leave due to his distance/moods. At the start of the summer, I told him it wasn‚Äôt sustainable for me and I needed change.¬†

Now, some additional context: we did break up a few years ago - he broke up with me and we were apart for about 11 months. During that break-up, I was obviously heartbroken and anxiously hoping that we would get back together the entire time. So, when the opportunity came up when I saw him at a mutual friend‚Äôs gathering, I was willing to ‚Äòdo anything‚Äô - including enter an open relationship/ENM with him. So, the past few years we have been ‚Äúopen‚Äù.¬†

Our ‚Äúopenness‚Äù has been more actively pursued on his end. I have barely engaged. This summer was the first time I did in a long time - with our neighbour. My neighbour and I built a strong bond very quickly, and spent (too much) time together this summer. It‚Äôs a whole topic on its own, but the result today is that I continue to think about my neighbour a lot; it distracts me from my relationship, and even though we are no longer in contact/seeing each other/communicating, I‚Äôm struggling to ‚Äúcommit‚Äù to my relationship. Yes, my partner knows about me being with my neighbour throughout the summer.¬† He was initially very supportive, but turned not supportive once he realised how much we had to work on as a couple.¬†

The whole summer until now, since I had that talk with my partner about things not being sustainable, he has truly ‚Äòstepped up‚Äô and become a version of a partner I‚Äôve rarely seen in him - incredibly loving and affectionate, consistently emotionally available, doing lots of gestures like making me coffee, etc, planning dates and time together. Things I‚Äôve asked for for years, honestly. Things I‚Äôve wanted forever, and that on paper, make him the ‚Äòperfect partner‚Äô - everything that I felt was ‚Äòmissing‚Äô the past years are now here. We‚Äôre also back to being monogamous. Awesome!

Nope. Not awesome. Because, for some reason, I am not feeling the joy and ecstasy I would have expected myself to. I feel somewhat numb, somewhat suffocated, a little uncomfortable and just not that into it. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs me now becoming avoidant/FA, but whatever it is, I‚Äôm just feeling a little checked out. And it‚Äôs confusing the hell out of me.¬†

Obviously, there are still some remnants of ‚Äònew relationship energy‚Äô from the time I spent with my neighbour, I don‚Äôt deny that and am aware that it may be swaying me here. But no matter how much I try and tell myself that my commitment to my long term partner is something I need to focus on in silos, not in comparison ot what I experienced over the summer, and no matter ho wmuch I try to focus on my partner, and this new dynamic he‚Äôs finally showing me after all these years - love, attention, consistency - my head isn‚Äôt fully present. I‚Äôve been a bit cold, distant, sterile - and I hate it. It‚Äôs not how I want to show up in my relationship at all. I do love him deeply. But I find myself struggling to lean into what we have. I find myself secretly hoping his visa doesn‚Äôt get extended so he has to go home, and I can stay here for a while alone. I find myself wanting him to break up with me. But at the same time, I see him as the father of my kids. I see a future back home with him, with all of our shared friends and families that are totally intertwined. I see stability with him in the long term, in the future. ¬†

I guess my questions revolve around‚Ä¶ how do I know if it‚Äôs time to leave a long term relationship because I intuitively feel it‚Äôs time for me to go out in the world and explore other energies and experiences and people, vs wrongfully leaving because I‚Äôve become wrapped up in this anxious thought battle with myself, and I end up sabotaging something that has so much potential? How do I know if I‚Äôm getting lost in temporary emotions that are pulling me towards short-term gratification, vs following ‚Äòmy heart‚Äô and allowing myself to experience playful curiosity when it arrives at my doorstep? This summer has been one of the best of my life, and honestly, my partner was barely part of it. How do I know if I‚Äôm living too much in the moment vs not thinking about my future back home long-term, where I will be moving back to eventually in the next year or so..

1nzr0an,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1nzr0an/learning_new_bad_health_effects_of_gaming_over/,Learning new (bad) health effects of gaming over 40yo.,"Posting this in case other people are experiencing the same. 

I'm a 40yo male. Been gaming on and off since I was like 10 years old. Love/d it. In recent years my gaming was sporadic, playing when friends could (like 1-2 times a month). Then I found Crazy Games, full of free Unity games of every genre. Some are bad. Some are decent FPS games. They scratched the itch. Now I didn't need to wait for my friends to play.

Over the last month or so I would play these a few times a week for like 5 hours per day. 

I was also drinking coffee (1 per day, nothing crazy) and working, maintaining a normal life. I eat well and exercise. I sleep 6-9 hours every night. 

Then I started feeling **really** fatigued. All day. Regardless of how much coffee I had or sleep I got. Persistent fatigue, mental fog, even some slight balance issues. It was very scary, but all my blood tests and head scans were/are fine. 

After more research it seems to be some sort of adrenal fatigue. We're not supposed to spend 5 hours per day stressed (on top of the 8 hours of work stress), but when we're younger we can handle it. When I was 22, I could play games for 8 hours straight, stay  up late, function at school/gym, etc. Those days are over. 

At this age, our adrenal glands take longer to recover. Additionally, doing this for a long time (weeks and months) can cause Dopamine and Cortisol imbalances. One indicator is if you feel tired in the morning but get a sudden burst of energy in the evening. 

I had no idea there was long-term wear happening, and according to research I've seen, it could take months to get all my systems back to normal. 

Be careful out there. We already know that too much gaming can pull us from social lives or lead to an unhealthy amount of sitting. But I can tell you from my experience that this sort of mental/physical fog is very scary and unsettling. ",7,1759775057.0,StopGaming,2,0.9,False

üëâ CONTINUE READING üëà
Chapter 1
My husband has bipolar disorder. The color red sends him into a violent rage.

Since we got married, I've only worn red twice. The first time, he went berserk and cracked my head open‚ÄîI ended up in the ER needing stitches.

The second time, he beat me so badly I lost the baby. I was three months pregnant.

After that, I never wore red again. I was so afraid of setting him off that even my underwear was plain white.

The day I got out of the hospital after the miscarriage, I was passing by the dining room, clutching my stomach, when I saw him‚Äîmy husband, who claimed to be working overtime‚Äîhaving dinner with a female student.

His eyes were full of admiration, brimming with affection. They couldn't help themselves, swaying into a slow dance right there at the table.

Right then, the doctor's office called, voice full of excitement. ""Mrs. Whitmore, we've developed a new treatment plan for Mr. Whitmore's condition‚Äî""

I looked at the swirl of red from the girl's dress, smiled bitterly, and said, ""Don't bother. The problem's already been solved.""

""Wait, what? We've been researching this for months and still couldn't figure out the source of Mr. Whitmore's episodes!"" the doctor said, clearly excited. ""This solution came from extensive consultations with a panel of experts‚Äî""

I slowly looked up. The girl upstairs was dancing a clumsy waltz, stepping all over his feet. And then, something inside me snapped‚ÄîI laughed. The kind of laugh that comes with tears.

Maybe the problem was never him. Maybe it was that... I never should've been Mrs. Whitmore in the first place.

I didn't stay to watch the rest of their little performance. I went home.

Opening my closet, I stared at the row of red dresses hanging neatly inside. Before I got married, red was my favorite color. But because Damian Whitmore couldn't stand to see me in it, I shoved them all to the back and let them collect dust.

But this time, I wasn't going to play his game anymore. I wasn't going to be part of the joke.

When he came home, what he saw was me‚Äîsitting there in a crimson dress, calmly sipping coffee.

He lunged at me, hands closing tightly around my neck. ""Didn't I tell you never to wear that color?""

His fist drew back, ready to strike‚Äîthen froze mid-air. His expression twisted in pain.

I remembered what he once told me, that he loved me. That he was doing everything he could to fight his impulses and not hurt me.

With a faint smile, I met his eyes. ""Damian. Didn't you say you loved me? I want to see if you can control yourself‚Äîfor me.""

He held back so hard the veins in his hands bulged. In the end, he shattered a wine bottle, slicing open his palm, then turned and walked out without another word.

I watched him go, my gaze turning cold. ""So you can control it, huh?""

The last time I wore red, it was by accident. He beat me so badly I lost our baby. I was lying in a hospital bed, and he stood at the edge, frowning.

""I told you to wear white from now on. No red. You know it's a trigger for me,"" he said.

Seeing how pale and broken I was, he finally softened, pulling me into his arms. ""Sweetheart, it's a psychological issue. I know it's not fair. I'm sorry. Just bear with me, okay? As long as you don't wear red, we'll be fine.""

So I nodded and swallowed all my bitterness.

Until Chloe Vance showed up‚Äîand made me realize how much of a fool I'd been.

While his private doctor was bandaging Damian in the living room, I was upstairs packing my suitcase. Maybe the noise I made alerted him.

""You're traveling again?"" he asked, stepping inside and wrapping his arms around me from behind. His kisses landed one by one along the back of my neck.

I stood there, stiff as stone, letting him kiss me like everything was normal. Like this was love. But it wasn't. It was fake.

""I still have a few things to finish. They need me there,"" I said.

There was no real trip. I just couldn't stand to look at him right now.

He started unbuttoning my shirt. ""Isabella..."" His voice turned hoarse. ""Hold me.""

He wanted it‚Äîagain. He pinned my hands above my head, trying to take what he wanted.

I didn't respond. I just pulled my arms away, rigid and silent.

He noticed something was off. His eyes opened. ""Isabella, you're still mad?""

I stayed quiet.

Then, without warning, he dropped to one knee and held up a gift box. ""I got you something. I hope you like it.""

Inside was a pure white dress.

I couldn't hide my disgust. I put the box aside without a word. ""Damian, let's get a divorce.""

Chapter 2
Right then, his phone buzzed‚Äîseveral messages coming in. Damian instinctively looked down, and I caught the way his expression softened.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the contact name: [Chloe.] She was cheerfully texting him about her day like they were lovers.

He finally looked up from his phone like nothing had happened. ""Hmm? What did you just say?""

It felt like punching a pillow‚Äîno resistance, no reaction.

His phone lock screen showed Chloe dancing in a red dress. Every time he saw it, his eyes turned soft, full of warmth and affection.

He never looked at me like that. Not once.

So when Chloe showed up at my door waving an ultrasound report in my face, claiming she was pregnant, I didn't hesitate.

I slapped her, hard.

She screamed in shock, lunging at me in disbelief. ""Isabella, you crazy bitch! How dare you hit me? Damian's not going to let you get away with this!""

The moment Damian heard the commotion, he stormed in. His face darkened the second he saw me with a fistful of Chloe's hair, pinning her against the wall like a rag doll.

""Isabella!"" he shouted, trying to pull me off her.

But I didn't get angry‚ÄîI smiled at him instead.

""Honey, this girl's been running a scam. Says she's pregnant with your child. Sounds insane, right? I thought I'd teach her a little lesson for old times' sake. After all, didn't we help her once before?""

Then I raised my fist again, aiming right at her stomach.

He grabbed my wrist before it landed. ""Isabella, stop it.""

""You're stopping me?"" I asked coldly.

Damian always cared about appearances. No matter what happened between us, he made sure to play the loving husband in public. But this time, in front of everyone, he was defending her‚Äînot me.

""What's that supposed to mean, Damian? Are you telling me she's actually telling the truth?"" I scoffed. ""Don't tell me the baby she's carrying is actually yours.""

I expected him to deny it, to make up some ridiculous excuse.

But he didn't. Instead, he looked me in the eye and said, ""Yes. It's mine.""

The slap I gave him echoed through the entire room.

His head snapped to the side. He didn't dodge. He didn't even move.

""Isabella, that night was a mistake. I thought she was you,"" he said quietly. ""But the doctor said she can't go through another abortion. If she does, she'll never be able to have children again. I can't ruin her.""

He stood in front of Chloe, shielding her with his entire body. That said everything I needed to know.

I remembered the first time I confronted him about her. He told me, ""Chloe's just a student. She just graduated. She was asking me for advice.""

In addition to being CEO of Whitmore Corporation, Damian also worked as a visiting professor at a university.

It might've sounded innocent at first‚Äîuntil I found the r√©sum√© he had hidden under his desk. He had already hired her into the company.

If it was just a mentor-student thing, fine. But then I saw them dancing‚ÄîDamian holding Chloe, who was in a bright red dress, kissing her like they were in love.

I nearly snapped a tree branch in half right then and there.

""Isabella, weren't you out of town?"" Damian reached out to me, trying to smooth things over. ""Can we talk about this at home?""

I shook him off coldly and turned to Chloe. ""Didn't you say red makes you lose control? What's the matter, Damian? Gone colorblind all of a sudden?""

""Do you remember what happened the last time I wore red? I had just found out I was pregnant. I wore red to celebrate‚Äîand you beat me until I lost the baby. Did you forget that?""

Damian stared at me, exhausted, defeated. ""I already said I'm sorry. Are you seriously going to keep bringing this up? How long are you planning to keep this up?""

Keep what up?

I actually laughed when I heard that word. ""That was a life. A human life. And you think I shouldn't be upset? Damian, either you make this woman get an abortion today, or you repay that life‚Äîwith your own.""

Chloe broke down crying, clinging to his sleeve in panic. ""Damian, I don't want to lose this baby!""

He took her hand and comforted her. ""I'm here. Don't be scared.""

He stood his ground. No one was going to touch Chloe.

""I already told you‚Äîshe can't have an abortion,"" he said firmly.

Then he dropped to one knee and looked at me. ""Take my life if you want. I'll do whatever you say, Isabella. Just... please.""

That fake sincerity again. Always pretending. Always putting on a show.

I smiled‚Äîbright and bitter. ""Alright.""

I picked up the vase next to me and hurled it at him.

""Don't hurt him!"" Chloe screamed, throwing herself between us. The vase hit her square in the back.

Damian's face drained of color. ""Chloe...""

He scooped her into his arms and panicked. ""It's okay. I'll get you to a doctor.""

Before leaving, he turned and shot me a cold, hateful glare. That's when I knew.

Damian wasn't going to forgive me.

But before that‚ÄîI'd already made sure the reporter hiding nearby had caught everything. Every word, every moment. By tonight, this would be the headline of every tabloid in Halewell City.

Damian, you think you can just use people and toss them aside? Like I'm some object?

Not this time.

This time, I'll make sure you learn exactly what it costs to hurt someone.

Sure enough, two hours later‚Äî#DamianWhitmoreCheatingScandal# was trending at the top of every feed.

Right then, his call came through, furious.

""Isabella! You're the one who leaked that story, aren't you? Take it down. Now!""

Chapter 3
I didn't say a word‚ÄîI just hung up the call without a second of hesitation. Then I blocked Damian.

Almost immediately, his messages started flooding in like missiles.

[Isabella, what the hell are you doing? Do you realize how much damage this is doing to the company? Our stock price is tanking!]

[Isabella, I know you're mad. But can we please talk this out at home?]

[If that's what you need, I'm willing to apologize...]

Expressionless, I powered off my phone and set it face down on the table. Then I looked across at the attorney. ""Let's continue.""

I pulled out a document I'd buried deep in my drawers and handed it to him. ""Can you take a look and tell me if this divorce agreement is still valid?""

Back before we got married, Damian had personally signed a blank divorce agreement.

We didn't have feelings for each other then. He looked me in the eye and said coldly, ""If you ever want out, just sign it. You're free to leave anytime. It's my way of giving you an out.""

Later, we grew closer. Damian, this so-called powerful CEO, would cook three meals a day for me.

He'd worry if I got cold or overheated, always putting me first. I was moved. I thought this life would last forever. So the agreement got buried and forgotten.

Before I discovered Chloe Vance existed, I never once considered divorce. Aside from his obsession with me not wearing red, Damian was good to me.

Even when I lost the baby in an accident, I managed to forgive him. I could handle being hurt‚Äîbut I couldn't stand being made a fool of.

The lawyer flipped through the document carefully, then nodded. ""Miss Hartman, this agreement is still valid. Once you sign it, it goes into effect.""

I signed it right there and handed it back. ""I want a divorce. As soon as possible.""

When I stepped out of the caf√©, it had started to drizzle. A black car honked at me‚ÄîDamian's car was parked right outside.

""Get in,"" he said as the window rolled down, revealing his cold face.

I didn't even pause. I walked right past the car.

""Isabella!"" Damian caught up to me and grabbed my arm. ""Are you really still going to keep this up?""

I slapped him across the face. ""Don't touch me. You make me sick.""

He stood there, staring coldly at me. His gaze dropped to my red dress. His brows furrowed deeply. ""Why are you always going against me?""

""Isabella, things used to be so good between us. Can't we just go back to the way we were? Chloe's injuries were only superficial. The baby's fine. If it weren't for that...""

""If it weren't for that, then what?"" I cut him off.

""Would you have killed me instead?""

""Isabella! What happened to you?"" His eyes filled with exhaustion and resentment.

""What happened to me‚Äîor what happened to you?"" I stared him down. ""Don't forget, Damian. You're the one who betrayed me first.""

I was done wasting words. I turned and walked away.

He followed me relentlessly. ""You were the one who arranged that reporter, weren't you? You contact her and have the article taken down!""

So that's why he came.

""Chloe saw the article and got so upset she nearly jumped off a building. I spent hours calming her down! Isabella, can't you stop being so selfish? Don't drag others down with you just because you're hurting.""

What a saint‚Äîso caring, so noble.

I turned around and let out a cold laugh. ""Selfish? I'm not just going to be selfish‚ÄîI'm going to burn it all to the ground.""

Chapter 4
Damian's face instantly changed. ""Isabella, don't touch her. I swear, that night was a mistake. Once she has the baby, I'll make sure she's out of our lives for good.""

His reaction gave him away.

My chest ached, but I still smiled. ""And what if I don't agree?""

I didn't just want a divorce‚ÄîI wasn't about to let him walk away that easily. The years I gave him, my youth, my energy‚Äîthey weren't worthless. He was going to pay them all back.

Damian's expression gradually turned cold. ""Then I guess I'll have to send you away for a while.""

By ""away,"" he meant sending me abroad. So I could ""cool off"" in a foreign place. But wasn't that just a fancier way of locking me up?

""You don't have the right to control my life. I'm not some pet you raised, Damian.""

I had walked out the door in a red dress, but he blocked me from leaving. ""Change your clothes before you go out. I said, no red.""

That defiant fire in me flared up. ""Why the hell can't I wear red?""

He actually said it like it made perfect sense. ""Red's only for Chloe. When she wears red, it helps with my psychological issues. Haven't you noticed how much better I've been lately?""

I broke free from his grip, so disgusted I almost gagged. ""You're unbelievable. With acting skills like that, why aren't you in Hollywood winning an Oscar?""

As if I still believed a single word from him.

I'd already checked the home security footage.

I saw how, while I was asleep in the middle of the night, he pinned Chloe down on the couch and kissed her.

I heard him say, holding her, ""My child can only come from your body. Isabella doesn't even deserve to think about keeping it. She's already married to me. She's gotten more than enough.""

So that whole story about red triggering his ""condition""? A lie.

Even the ""accidental"" miscarriage‚Äîit was all part of his plan.

I had no more words for Damian. I went back to the villa, packed my things, and made one call. ""I've made up my mind. I'm leaving the country. Come pick me up.""

Right after I hung up, someone unexpected showed up. Chloe Vance.

After she took a hit from a vase meant for Damian, she had moved into the Whitmore villa like it was her birthright. Now she stood in front of me, heavily pregnant, wearing my pajamas‚Äîand gloating.

""Isabella, don't you think you're a total failure as a woman? You couldn't keep your man. You couldn't even keep your baby. Why don't you just die already?""

""Do yourself a favor and give up the title of Mrs. Whitmore. Hand it over to me. Otherwise, staying in that position just makes you look like a joke.""

I didn't blow up at her this time. I walked calmly to the window. The sun was shining outside.

""Chloe, you think just because you're pregnant, you've already won? Why don't you take a look at this?""

I handed her a file on an IVF procedure. ""Damian lied to you. You think you're the one he loves. But in reality, you're just a tool. The baby in your womb‚Äîit's mine.""

Chloe's face went pale. ""No... you're lying! Damian wouldn't do this to me‚Äîhe loves me!""

She started trembling all over like she might shatter at any second. I felt satisfied. So I gave the fire another stoke.

I took out a voice recorder and pressed play.

Damian's deep voice came through clearly: ""Isabella, don't worry. As soon as the baby is safely born, I'll send Chloe away. She'll never show up in our lives again.""

Chloe fell apart. All her smug confidence vanished. ""I need to talk to Damian! I need to know if this is true! Why would he lie to me?""

She ran out crying.

The butler came over, glancing at me nervously. ""Mrs. Whitmore, aren't you afraid the master will come after you for tricking Miss Vance like that?""

I looked into the mirror, smiling at my own reflection. Calm. Numb. Quietly dead inside.

""If I were still scared of him... I wouldn't be Isabella Hartman.""

I've only been beaten twice in my life.

The first time, it was Damian. He saw me in a red dress and beat me so badly I ended up in the hospital, needing stitches. Thirteen of them.

The second time was when I lost the baby.

Because I'd been stupid enough to believe in love.

But I swore‚Äîthere would never be a third time.

Sure enough, that day, Chloe started bleeding. The doctor said it was from emotional stress. The baby didn't make it.

But I knew the real reason.

Damian was in the middle of a board meeting when he got the news. He immediately stopped everything and rushed to the hospital.

And I stood alone in the villa, watching the security footage. I smiled. Then picked up the phone.

""It's time. Come get me.""

Now it was my turn to give Damian a surprise.

After hearing about Chloe's miscarriage, Damian rushed to the hospital.

He was furious‚Äîhe didn't understand how this could've happened when the housekeeper had been looking after her so well.

He was trying to investigate everything when suddenly, he got a call from an unknown number.

For the past year, I've been pouring my life into building a CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System) from the ground up. As someone who's seen the frustrations of clunky, overpriced, and overly complicated maintenance software, I wanted to create something different. Something that feels modern, is genuinely helpful, and uses today's tech to make the lives of maintenance managers, supervisors, and techs easier.

My goal was to build a CMMS that¬†**uses AI to help you get ahead of problems, not just document them after the fact.**

Imagine:

* An operator sends a garbled email like ""the big machine is making a weird noise again"". The AI instantly turns it into a structured, prioritized work order with the right asset attached.
* A tech gets a critical task but isn't sure where to start. They click a button, and the AI gives them a practical list of troubleshooting steps based on the problem description.
* Instead of guessing, the system analyzes an asset's entire history to predict the next likely failure, letting you schedule proactive maintenance¬†before¬†the production line stops.

This is what I've been building. It's a bootstrapped project, which means it's just me, a ton of coffee, and a passion for making maintenance management suck less.

**Here's where you come in. I need your feedback.**

I'm opening up a beta program and would love to invite interested individuals to be the first users. Here's the deal:

* **3 months of full-featured access, completely free.**¬†No credit card, no nonsense.
* If you love it and want to continue after the 3 months, I'll give you a¬†**lifetime 50% discount**¬†on whatever the final go-to-market price ends up being.

My ask? Just use it and tell me what you think. What's great? What's broken? What's missing? Your feedback will be invaluable.

If you're interested, please¬†**join the waiting list here:** [**Waiting list**](https://www.makeform.ai/f/1rzV3i07)

I'm putting the finishing touches on a complete video presentation and will send it out to everyone on the list by the end of next week.

**One more thing...**

As a bootstrapped founder, getting that first B2B contract is a huge milestone. To show my appreciation for your early support in my starting journey, I'm making this offer: if you introduce my product to your company and they end up signing a contract,¬†**I will personally send you ‚Ç¨1000.**¬†Think of it as a finder's fee and a massive thank you for helping me get this off the ground.

Thanks for reading. I'm really excited to share this with you all.

It was the first of February, 2067. A cold morning. I was sitting in an empty carriage of the commuter train **Znam‚Äôyanka ‚Äî Novoukrainka** \[Small Ukrainian cities\] and thinking the job would be easy. I worked for an outfit called **‚ÄúShvydkoKesh‚Äù** \[literally quick-money loan-shark business/payday loans\] ‚Äî a collector, or as people say back home, a *debt-banger* \[slang for someone who forces repayment, often by threats or violence\].

A small, you could even say ‚Äúfamily‚Äù business. Boss Stepan Viktorovych, his wife Yana Olehivna, and their screw-up son Kolya. They serviced the lower end of the market: people who didn‚Äôt have enough for rent, a fix, a dose, or who‚Äôd simply given up. A crazy interest rate turned five thousand **enerho-hryvnias** \[‚Äúenergo-hryvnia‚Äù ‚Äî a futuristic currency unit; literally ‚Äúenergy-hryvnia‚Äù\] into hundreds of thousands fast.

That‚Äôs where your humble servant ‚Äî Vadym Mahmudovych ‚Äî came in. After Stepan Viktorovych made the ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù phone calls and Kolya delivered the threats, if the debt wasn‚Äôt paid I‚Äôd go to the debtor, dig him out from under whatever rock he was under, and extract everything he could scrape together. It wasn‚Äôt my first time roughing people up. Back in my hooligan years I‚Äôd shout ‚ÄúKrop, Zirka, Volia!‚Äù \[local chants/places ‚Äî evocative slang\], now it was ‚ÄúThis is for the January overdue!‚Äù

They paid minimum wage plus ten percent of what I pulled. I lived like a confident representative of the lower tier of the middle class. My father, who‚Äôd come to Ukraine in the immigration wave of the thirties, would have been happy that I‚Äôd made my life. Compared to his native Ulan-Ude ‚Äî liberated by our brave Armed Forces, where now white bears were devouring Muscovites ‚Äî I really did live in paradise.

I sucked the bitter, warm **synth-coffee** \[‚Äúsinto-‚Äù prefix = synthetic; i.e., lab-made coffee\] from a **Ukrzaliznytsia** cup \[Ukrainian Railways, the national rail company\] and skimmed the halo-screen. Some candidate for deputy promised: ‚ÄúLow taxes, a strong private sector, social mobility! Vote for the top name on the list.‚Äù I smiled crookedly and opened my HUD interface, pulling information from the implant to my retinal display. Nobody will improve my life for me. And to make that happen ‚Äî you have to work. So I decided to read the dossier on today‚Äôs client again; as Stepan Viktorovych liked to say, this one needed his ‚Äúdebt optimized.‚Äù

The dossier was interesting. An old man born in ‚Äô91: Dmytro Andriyovych Pyvovarenko. A contemporary of independence. On the surface a respectable man: an individual entrepreneur, real estate in Kropyvnytskyi, now living at a dacha by the woods. Three children, seven grandchildren, and even pawned his thirty-year model ‚Äúbimmer‚Äù \[slang for a BMW\] as collateral.

He borrowed a hundred thousand from us for ‚Äúbusiness development‚Äù ‚Äî now owed half a million. I whistled inwardly. Why not a normal bank? Ah ‚Äî the credit limit at the state bank had been exhausted. So he became our VIP client. I did the math ‚Äî forty thousand would certainly be welcome.

I switched off the HUD. Ten minutes to the terminal on the halo-screen. I stood, pulled on my black winter jacket from **AirBoss** with built-in **GloryTherm** \[fictional heated insulation brand\]. It keeps you warm down to minus fifty. Moisture- and wind-proof ‚Äî with a holey ozone layer you don‚Äôt go anywhere without it. You wouldn‚Äôt be ashamed to show up in it even at a yachting Baltic regatta‚Ä¶ ah, dreams.

I went to the lavatory ‚Äî the only place without cameras to make final preparations. Used it, washed up. The water was chlorinated; you couldn‚Äôt drink it since Soviet times, and even less now, but it‚Äôll do to wash. I smoothed my black curly hair and my bushy beard and thought, ‚ÄúNice to be brown, people think I‚Äôm richer in winter.‚Äù

I took my shortened **Nagant M1895** \[old school Russian revolver used during Tsarat era and later by NKVD officers\] out of my pocket and checked the cylinder: five rounds. I‚Äôd never fired it, but the boss insisted I carry that chthonic retro-monster. When I asked him, ‚ÄúWhy not a smartgun?‚Äù he answered: ‚ÄúRetro is reliability.‚Äù

Last thing ‚Äî a gum with microdoses of CBD and THC. Not to fly away, just to gather myself. Not to fall apart when I had to be steel.

I stepped into the vestibule as the train stopped and jumped onto the platform. A few older people and a terribly skinny student also got out. A gray mercurial mist rose into the sky, as if all of winter breathed in my face.

I looked up and said, ‚ÄúForgive your servant, Allah, if you are somewhere. I know usury is haram \[forbidden\], but it‚Äôs a job.‚Äù

Then I pulled the hood up and set off confidently for the address where my grandpa-client lived. There were village houses, the grunting of pigs somewhere, third roosters crowing. Snow up to my knees ‚Äî glad I wore boots, ski pants, and long underwear. An agro-drone flew overhead, skillfully dodging the dense fiber-optic wires running to the houses, whose chimneys belched thick coal smoke. I waded through the drifts thinking, ‚ÄúCities are horrors; villages are worse‚Ä¶‚Äù

After half an hour I reached the house, and before I could get to the gate I saw the old man on the porch in a **fufayka** \[quilted padded jacket\], pipe in his teeth, a mink hat, padded trousers. A slightly comic dacha-owner image, ruined by one terrible detail: a double-barrel shotgun. It boomed a warning shot right at my feet. Then the old man shouted:

‚ÄúFirst warning! Second ‚Äî between the eyes!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou damned abrek! What? From Akhmat‚Äôs gang?‚Äù \[‚Äúabrek‚Äù ‚Äî bandit/outlaw; ‚ÄúAkhmat‚Äù evokes Chechen/warlord associations\]

‚ÄúHow many of them have I put down? This isn‚Äôt Grozny, damn it! This is my forest!‚Äù

‚ÄúNow shout ‚Äòpalyanytsia‚Äô!‚Äù \[*palyanytsia* ‚Äî a Ukrainian shibboleth/password word; non-Ukrainian speakers historically struggle to pronounce it correctly; used as an identity check\]

‚ÄúPalyanytsia, grandpa! Palyanytsia! I am Ukrainian! This is ShvydkoKesh ‚Äî a notification of non-payment of debt! I‚Äôm here to offer consultancy on optimizing repayments! I mean no harm! Lower your weapon, please!‚Äù

The old man‚Äôs eyes glowed infrared. A thermal-viewer? Built into his retina?

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that iron thing in your pocket? Get it out and throw it on the ground! No sudden moves! Or I‚Äôll shoot ‚Äî and that will be that!‚Äù

So there you have Stepan Viktorovych and his ‚ÄúReliable Retro,‚Äù but for reliable retro you need a retro old man who‚Äôd been through four campaigns and thirty assaults, not some thug who never leaves the city. I carefully pulled the Nagant from my pocket and buried it in the snow.

‚ÄúForgive me! Occupational hazard. Clients can react‚Ä¶ aggressively.‚Äù

The old man snorted.

‚ÄúPoor collector. Pah!‚Äù He lowered the gun. ‚ÄúIf you want to talk, come into the house ‚Äî we‚Äôll talk about my debts and how to pay them.‚Äù

I opened the gate and went into the yard. No drifts here; the area was perfectly cleared of snow, paved with cobbles, fruit trees around, no chimney belching coal smoke, but solar panels. The old man was clearly in good shape.

We went into the two-story, freshly whitewashed house. Inside a kitchen-dining room greeted us ‚Äî cozy and spacious, retro 2030s style, minimalist, monochrome, a fireplace burning, obvious thermal regulation. The old man took off his quilted jacket and hung it on a hook; I immediately perspired and took off my jacket, which cost a quarter of a worker‚Äôs salary.

Dmytro Andriyovych brought out Chinese tea ware and began brewing.

‚ÄúGood Oolong is rare now, so enjoy. I don‚Äôt like people in general, but you‚Äôre here for work. So you‚Äôre not a person ‚Äî you‚Äôre a function. And you can talk to a function.‚Äù

I sat on one of the chairs at the table and smiled at him.

‚ÄúDear Mr. Dmytro Andriyovych. You haven‚Äôt paid interest on the loan for six months. Considering penalties and compound interest, you now owe half a million enerho-hryvnias. Since ShvydkoKesh always meets the client halfway, I propose to restructure the loan: break the payments over five years, pay gradually so you‚Äôll still have money to live on.‚Äù

The old man poured the Oolong into cups. I sipped; the tea was divine. Not a sharp chemical bitterness, but natural, from faraway Himalayan hills. It invigorated gently, like a cozy warm-up.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt afraid of Akhmat, I‚Äôm not afraid of ShvydkoKesh either. Your PR is bad,‚Äù he said, took a sip, ‚Äúlook at this.‚Äù

He put a tablet on the table; the screen lit up: **State Tender ‚Äî Central Development Manager** \[a government procurement portal\]. ‚ÄúIn five minutes a decision: whose program will be added to *Diia*‚Äù \[*Diia* ‚Äî the Ukrainian government‚Äôs digital service app\]. ‚ÄúIt so happens I participated. So drink your tea and watch how I become a multi-millionaire at seventy-five. I‚Äôll pay all debts. But somehow I feel ShvydkoKesh will close earlier and I will not give you a single hryvnia.‚Äù

I shrugged with my micro-amplified ‚ÄúKarpattek-6‚Äù \[implanted micro-amplifier device\], took another sip of tea, and said, ‚ÄúAlright, sir, we‚Äôll wait to see if your ‚ÄòWunderwaffe‚Äô \[joking: Wunderwaffe = ‚Äòmiracle weapon‚Äô, here meaning his project\] fires even once.‚Äù

I sipped and thought, ‚ÄúWhat if it does fire?‚Äù The five minutes stretched like five hours. Then the screen displayed: **Tender Winner: Dmytro Andriyovych Pyvovarenko.** And at that moment ‚Äî like thunder. But not from the sky. Inside.

It fired. At me.

The HUD died. I went blind ‚Äî minus three, everything blurred.

My hands fell as if they weren‚Äôt mine. Karpattek-6 vanished. My heart hammered like crazy. I gasped and collapsed to the floor.

Something, like an invisible stone weighing a ton, pressed me into the ground.

And then... a voice. Inside the skull.

Not human.

Not machine.

Ancient as an avalanche. Cold as a dead server.

‚ÄúVadym. Don‚Äôt offend the old man. He is my father.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is Central Development Manager. CDM.‚Äù \[–¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–π –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—ñ–Ω–µ—Ü—å –†–æ–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∫–æ–º ‚Äî an in-story AI/agency acronym; in Ukrainian abbreviation: –¶–£–†\]

‚ÄúI analyzed your life and 87,451 variants of your potential.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are a parasite. But with one useful application.‚Äù

‚ÄúBy six in the evening upload from your boss‚Äôs safe data to NABU.‚Äù \[–ù–ê–ë–£ ‚Äî National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine; major anti-corruption agency\]

‚ÄúIf you do ‚Äî you will get admission to Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. Major: ‚ÄòSecurity Management.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt ‚Äî I will optimize you.‚Äù \[implied threat of erasure/termination\]

‚ÄúDo you understand the terms?‚Äù

And as it began ‚Äî so it ended.

The HUD blinked back on. My hands obeyed again. My sight returned. My heart back in my chest, not my throat.

I wiped sweat from my brow while the old man, without lifting his eyes, smiled into his white moustache:

‚ÄúSo? How‚Äôs the tea?‚Äù

I sprang to my feet.

‚ÄúAll clear, Mr. Dmytro Andriyovych! Loan ‚Äî forgiven. Tea ‚Äî thank you. Visit ‚Äî unforgettable.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt even remember how I got to the platform, first into one commuter, then another, on the way to Kropyvnytskyi.

And in my head ‚Äî a strike, like a gong:

‚ÄúI am not a ‚Äòglitch,‚Äô Vadym. I am the CDM.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo as I say. Or you get the screws. Do it and you‚Äôll live like in Miami: education, a clean record, assignments abroad, clean money, a real job, benefit to people.‚Äù

Now I was standing before the entrance to ShvydkoKesh. Ground floor of an apartment building in the city center. A cigarette smouldered in my mouth. A blizzard outside. No cars. Everything frozen. The Nagant seemed to be left in the snow by the old man‚Äôs house ‚Äî whatever. I‚Äôd always managed without a gun and I‚Äôd manage this time too. I even grabbed a crowbar on the way out ‚Äî a strong argument in negotiations. I spat the butt into the snow. HUD read 16:30. An hour and a half to spare ‚Äî fine.

I approached the office door and ripped it open. The foyer was empty. Olga wasn‚Äôt there ‚Äî in such a blizzard there‚Äôd be no clients anyway. I strode to the door marked ‚ÄúStaff Only.‚Äù Kicked it with my foot.

Inside Kolya sat smoking a joint, wearing an expensive gray suit that hung like a sack, eyes red as two **synth-cherry** tomatoes \[i.e., lab-grown tomatoes\]. He twirled a ‚ÄúShvydkoKesh‚Äù pen like an ‚Äúintellectual.‚Äù Neither his father nor mother were present ‚Äî all the easier.

‚ÄúVadym? What are you doing here? This will be on your pay for corporate property damage!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôll transfer it to your prison card! I quit, you little shit, and I‚Äôll send you and your whole family to bunks!‚Äù I showed him the crowbar. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be dumb Kolya ‚Äî open the safe nicely.‚Äù

‚ÄúScrew you!‚Äù

Kolya clumsily leapt up and, for some reason, grabbed a stapler. He lunged at me. I decided not to soil my hands and stepped aside at the right moment. Kolya flew across the room, slipped and fell into the cabinet with the **register of debtors**. It bounced off the wall and fell on Kolya, burying him under hundreds of papers about debts, clients, arrears and other bureaucratic tatters.

I shrugged, walked to the safe, and remembered my father‚Äôs words from when we lifted dumbbells together: ‚ÄúSometimes strong muscles, son, are worth more than a flexible tongue.‚Äù You were right, old man ‚Äî may Jannat \[Arabic for paradise; used as a blessing\] be sweet for you.

I rammed the crowbar into the safe door seam, flexed my muscles and set Karpattek-6 to full power. I smashed my palm ‚Äî it hurt ‚Äî but the pry bar went in. I heaved and tore the door from its hinges. Inside were documents. Lots. And thick stacks of big-denomination enerho-hryvnias, and crypto storage drives.

I methodically photographed everything: every document, the safe with the black cash, the white and black accounting, proof of consumer rights violations, proof of organized extortion. My boss‚Äôs family faced decades behind bars and asset confiscation. I sent the data to NABU and the SBU \[SBU ‚Äî Security Service of Ukraine\] and the Police, just to be sure.

I sank into a chair, lit a cigarette, closed my eyes. Exhaled smoke. Smiled. Far away I heard police sirens. Then my boss, his wife and his son would be arrested. The debtors‚Äô loans would be written off. And I would become a student. There would be new difficulties and challenges, but today the victory was mine.

And the CDM too. On the office halo-screen the Minister of Digitalization gave an interview about the success of the program just implemented that morning. A wave of arrests of corrupt officials and criminals swept the country. GDP magically rose three percent in half a day. Thousands of people of different professions and social statuses were already recruited.

The CDM addressed me again, this time calmly but just as firmly and without cutting implants off.

Since this is my first time posting here, I‚Äôm not sure how far the discussions have gone or if there are answers I might have missed.

As we‚Äôve all seen, Vine item updates arent what they once were. The real question I have is: are the curtains closing for Vine? What‚Äôs really going on here? Are we witnessing before us the slow but very real dying of Vine? Does anyone know anything concrete?

There‚Äôs one answer I read somewhere on the inter web that made sense to me‚Äîsomething along the lines of how, since tariffs have been imposed, people are afraid to spend. But my gosh, how serious the ripple effects of that must be. If it‚Äôs true, how exactly does that affect vine, I wonder.¬†

I suppose my follow-up question would be: are the tariffs effectively killing Vine? How bad is the damage, really? Is this something Vine will recover from? Maybe your guesses are just as good as mine, and we‚Äôre all equally in the dark here.

I actually have screenshots from when I first got invited about six months ago, taken with the excitement and amazement that i had got in!
