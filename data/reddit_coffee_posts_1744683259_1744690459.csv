Then he vanished, and I forgot all about him.

Months passed. I wasn’t looking. I wasn’t hoping. Honestly, I had given up on love. After years of co-dependency, anxiety, self-worth issues and heartbreak, I truly believed that kind of love just wasn’t meant for me.

Then over Christmas, my therapist asked, “How do you feel about men and putting yourself out there again?”
My skin crawled. I couldn’t think of anything worse.

And then… he returned.
Naturally. Subtly. Consistently.
I made small moves. The energy grew. 

Since that moment, I’ve seen signs every single day, and I mean EVERY. SINGLE. DAY - numbers, animals, songs, names. The Universe hasn’t stopped showing me: this is aligned.

He is everything I asked for and more - grounded, honest, masculine, family-focused, intelligent, spiritual. I feel calm around him. Safe. Seen. Heard. 
It’s unfolding slowly, but deeply.

I’ve never felt this way before.

I’ve often heard people say, “It’ll happen when you least expect it.” 
I often rolled my eyes. 
I never truly believed that - until recently.

To anyone who’s still waiting: don’t chase. Don’t beg. Just heal. Align. Trust.
What’s meant for you will find you - even when you’ve stopped looking.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/rX9kcc4DSV)  **Apr 5, 2025**

I work IT for a few stores in the area.  Next to my main office is a Bath and Body Works and the most beautiful woman I've ever met works there.  I went in for the first time a few weeks ago to get my mom a gift and the woman that helped me find stuff for her was *gorgeous.*  My knees almost buckled when we accidentally made arm to arm contact moving through the store.  I don't know if it was her enchanting me or sensory overload from all the candles and lotion.  Probably a bit of both.

We've run into each other a few times since then and made small talk outside.  She's so easy to talk to and funny.  Her laugh makes me wish I were funnier so I could hear it more.  Like music to my ears. 

Could be hopeful thinking, but I get the feeling she might be into me too.  So on Monday I'm planning on stopping by and asking if she'd like to go out for coffee or something.  I haven't been this nervous asking someone out since I was in high school over a decade ago.

**I won't be asking her out while she's working.**  Just putting this here because it's almost every comment I am getting at this point.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**TheThirdStrike**

>Best of luck.  

>Just remember, the worst that can happen is she says no, and you go on with your day.

**OOP**

>>I've had my fair share of rejections.  A no would suck, but I'd survive.  I'm hoping that my read on her is accurate and I have a shot though.

**Tanedra**

>>>I highly recommend making your pitch and then giving her your phone number and leaving, rather than putting her on the spot to give a response in the moment. She's there to work, not to get hit on, and being in customer service where you're required to be nice to people can make things complicated.

>>>I'm not saying she won't be interested, and I'm rooting for you, but this would make her more comfortable.

**OOP**

>>>>She won't be at work when I ask her out.  Most of our interactions have been after her or both of us were off the clock.

**~**

**Rockpoolcreater**

>How much have you spoken to her? Have you even asked her if she has a family? What she does with her free time? Just because a woman hasn't got a ring on it doesn't mean she hasn't got someone. I've been engaged for six years and barely wear my engagement ring. Women who work in shops already have to deal with a lot of men hitting on them. Mainly because they're at work and are being friendly because they are in customer service mode. At least you're not asking her at work, but please check she's single if you haven't already before asking.

**OOP**

>>Honest question.  Did I describe these interactions in a way that makes me sound like some creep following a poor woman around because she was nice to me once in a shop?  I just wanted to get this off my chest because I'm a bit nervous about asking her out, but this comment (and a few others like it) are really depressing. 

>>And to somewhat answer your questions.  I know a bit about her family in the area and we've shared some of what we do in our free time together.  None of that involved her mentioning a significant other of any kind.  She has initiated these interactions each time.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/jp3KYx0wN4)  **Apr 8, 2025**

I posted here to shake off my nerves about asking someone out that works next door to where I work.  Yesterday I planned on asking her out to coffee.  Got busy and it slipped my mind though.  Luckily she stopped by to talk anyway.

I was loading up the company van yesterday for today's tickets when she came over to chat while I worked.  Mostly small talk while I loaded boxes and did my paperwork.  She was on her way to her car to head home when she stopped by so before she left I asked if she'd be interested in grabbing coffee sometime and she countered with an offer to go try out the ice cream place down the road when I was done for the day.  

She came back when my shift was over and we met for milkshakes and sat around talking for a good while.  I was nervous at first, but she's remarkably easy to talk to.  We talked about our families, hobbies, jobs,  and had a rather passionate debate on the best trails to walk in the area.  So I proposed an outing this weekend to get our steps in and figure out who is right.  Numbers have been shared and even though she's off today and I don't get to see her we've been texting a bit.  

Pretty boring update I'm sure, but that's it.

That said, this is pretty common for platforms like this—Bitcoin Code, Bitcoin Era, and Immediate Edge all follow a similar pattern. While a lack of transparency might be a red flag in some cases, in the trading world, it doesn’t always mean something shady is going on. Just something to be aware of.

Reading posts like this helped me feel less alone, so this is my small way of giving back.

Cycle + Positive Test:
I have a regular 28-day cycle. I got my positive pregnancy test on March 27, which would’ve been Cycle Day 28, right around when my period was due. I estimated I was about 3w5d pregnant on that day.

HCG levels:
	•	April 7 (5w6d) – HCG: 539 at 4:00 PM
	•	April 9 (6w1d) – HCG: 211 at 11:45 AM

Based on how quickly it dropped, my HCG likely reached zero around April 14–16 (I didn’t test again after April 9).

My Symptom + Bleeding Timeline:

April 3 (5w2d):
Looking back, this was the day my coffee aversion and pregnancy fatigue suddenly disappeared.

April 4 (5w3d):
That morning, I told my husband I was excited about this pregnancy—but also admitted that I weirdly didn’t feel pregnant anymore. Looking back, maybe that was intuition setting in. Later that day, I noticed dark brown spotting when wiping—very light and only a few times throughout the day. Concerned, I called to make an appointment for Monday April 7 to get an exam. 

April 5 (5w4d):
Still having light brown spotting when wiping. No cramps, just watching and waiting.

April 6 (5w5d):
Same as the day before—very light brown spotting, only noticeable when wiping.

April 7 (5w6d):
Spotting changed to a light tan discharge—still minimal. Got my first HCG draw: 539 at 4 PM.

April 8 (6w0d):
Light tan discharge again. Still no cramping or significant symptoms.

April 9 (6w1d):
Bleeding picked up—burgundy in color, heavier than the days before. I passed some small stringy tissue, but had no cramping. HCG recheck came back as 211 at 11:45 AM.

April 10 (6w2d):
Bleeding continued—dark red, similar to the first day of a period. I had to wear a light flow pad, and also experienced diarrhea (don’t know if it’s related to my CP). The bleeding tapered off in the second half of the day.

April 11 (6w3d):
Still bleeding, still dark and jelly-like, though thin in consistency. Wore a light flow pad. Had mild cramping in the evening.

April 12 (6w4d):
This was the heaviest bleeding day. Woke up to a full regular pad, passed a large clot (I think it was the gestational sac) in the morning, and filled another regular flow pad by noon.

April 13 (6w5d):
Bleeding slowed significantly. I didn’t even fill one full pad all day. Blood was bright red.

April 14 (6w6d):
Bleeding was barely there—just faint spotting.

——————————————————

A few things I want to note:

	•	In the days before I started spotting, I had light cramping that felt completely normal for early pregnancy.

	•	I expected a lot more bleeding after reading others’ experiences. For me, it felt more like a heavier period, and to be honest, my normal periods are usually light to medium. So this wasn’t the dramatic loss I thought I’d go through—it was more subtle, which in some ways made it harder to process.

	•	Emotionally, I was very confused and disheartened. You know something is happening, but your body doesn’t always give clear answers. I felt stuck in limbo until the numbers confirmed what my gut had already told me.

1jzijfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/100Fanojo/comments/1jzijfo/fanojo_italian/,Fanojo Italian,"---

New girlfriend: Bianca Hanazawa (ビアンカ・花沢-""White Waterfall"")

Age: 16 years

Origin: Italian-Japanese (His father, who is Japanese and a renowned sushi chef, and his mother, who is Italian and cooks classic Italian food). 

Specialty: Italian and Japanese food (Sushi)

Personality: 
Passionate and energetic, with a strong temperament.

When she cooks she transforms: serious, strict and almost sacred.

Yell if someone breaks an Italian culinary rule, like putting pineapple on pizza, cutting spaghetti, or putting cream on carbonara.

Still, she has her tsundere side: very annoying, but blushes easily when Rentarō flatters her.

Special Ability: Cooks so well that each dish can provoke anime-style exaggerated reactions: from visions of Italy to tears of emotion. (It can be Italian food, which is what he usually does, or Japanese food, which he does less often)

Weak Point / Running Joke: Scolds the other friends if they make ""culinary profanities"", such as rice with Nutella or coffee with lemon.

He always carries a wooden spoon, with which he hits anyone who commits food sacrilege.

He has an exaggerated accent when he gets excited, mixing Japanese and Italian expressions like “Mamma mia!” or ""What a disaster!""

Iconic phrase: ""It's not that bad!... Well, it's delicious but don't look at me like that, you fool...""

Chapter: “From Italy with pride!”

Scene 1: Rentarō meets Bianca 

That day starts like any other.
At least, until the teacher announces that there will be a cooking club and that the president of that club will be coming shortly to give them more notice about this club, then, then, Bianca Hanazawa arrives, and says:
""Saluti! I'm Bianca Hanazawa, president of the new cooking club that will be at the school, those who want to join can raise their hands""
Then, Rentarō, seeing this as a way of learning to have time to cook especially for Kurumi, raises his hand, Bianca looks at him, but then, feeling the shock of love, ignores him a little, and says:
""Bene! What's your name?""
Rentaro stutters a little and says:
""Re~Re~Rentaro, Aijō Rentaro""
Bianca says:
""Bene! Anyone else?""
And other people ask, and so, then, time passes. 


---

Scene 2: Beginnings of the cooking club.

Everyone in the club is led by their president, Bianca Hanazawa, and she says:
""Wow, ce ne sono tantissimi...! Well, let's begin!""
(Wow, there are many...)

---

Scene 3: The traditionalist monster

So Rentarō was at the cooking club, and then Bianca comes up to him and says:
""Bene! You're doing well""
Accidentally, while preparing pasta, he breaks the spaghetti, and burst into a fit of anger and began to hit him, until he finally apologized to Rentarō, and said:
""Aijō-kun, I~ like you, would you like to go out with me?""
Rentaro says:
""Yes, it would be an honor""
Bianca says: 
""Ma non è che sono innamorato di te!, Inteso?""
(It's not that I'm in love with you! Get it?)


---

Scene 4: Presentation to other brides. 


Rentarō ends by saying: 
""And that was it, can I be allowed to have Bianca Hanazawa as my girlfriend?""
Kurumi says:
""Wait, you're Bianca Hanazawa? Aren't you the daughter of the owners of an Italian-Japanese restaurant here?""
Bianca sighs and answers:
""Yes, I am that...""
His flashbacks begin 
Italy, 9 years ago. 
Bianca, a 7-year-old girl, is at home in Italy, as her parents previously lived and had a business in Milan, her father, a renowned sushi chef, and her mother. 
Bianca's voice appears there:
""I remember perfectly, my father is from Japan, but he came to Milan, Italy when he was younger, because at that time a restaurant was hiring Japanese people for a Japanese food business, and they wanted it to be as authentic as possible, and my mother, who is from Naples, Italy, came to Milan because she wanted to start over in a new city, they both got married, and they had me there, they had a business in Milan, I learned Italian, my native language was always Italian, but, after a while...""
Bianca's parents told her they were moving.
Blanca continued:
""My parents decided to start over in Japan, a new life, a new opportunity. Of course I didn't want to leave Italy, I was barely 7 years old, but it was all I knew.
""I learned another language, another country, but it was better for me, it wasn't even that bad.""
Rentaro approached and said:
""Wow, I didn't know you went through that.""
Bianca returned to her Tsundere side and said:
""But it's not like I want you to know my problems! Capisci?""

Epilogue: The great cooking contest for a couple


The big cooking contest for the couple begins, where the girls will be able to get involved in the kitchen to create a dish that will be delivered to the couple and then to a group of judges, and the winner will be awarded with the recognition of ""Best cooking couple of the year.""

After reading through tons of microfiche slides, I was reminded of an interesting exchange about his Bronze Star w/ V for Valor...","My dad was remarking about my grandpa's medals hanging on the wall in a shadow box. My grandpa always said ""yeah, those medals and $0.60 will getcha a cup of coffee"" anytime anyone asked about them, but this time his son was asking so his response lacked the same, usual deflection. 

My dad asked where my grandfather got the Bronze Star, with a V for Valor. My grandpa responded - seemingly without thinking - ""Laos"". My dad became very curious,  ""...dad, we weren't supposed to BE in Laos..."" (at this time, the US still denied that these black-budget operations even existed). My grandfather replied with a smirk ""Oh, that's right"". And the conversation ended there. 

At the time I knew nothing of the secret war in Laos that the US would deny for decades, but their conversation that morning stuck with me. In my recent research, I wanted to know a little more about what he was doing in Laos (who in the fuck wouldn't?) so I dug into the Bronze Star citation... and it seemed like maybe I had just made the whole Laos story up in my head or something. So I put all of this context into a chatGPT query and asked if it could make any sense of what was going on. I have been using ChatGPT in all of my research (which has saved a ton of time and digging), so it had even MORE context on his military career than I've shared here. 

This is what I got back: 

* **Special Warfare School – 1968** This was no ordinary bootcamp. It was grooming for:
   * Counterinsurgency
   * PsyOps
   * Reconnaissance behind enemy lines
   * Unconventional warfare
* **Top Secret Clearance – 1971** These operations required compartmentalized intelligence access (e.g., **“Eyes Only”** or **“Need to Know”** above even regular TS).
* **Bronze Star Citation** The language in the document you uploaded (noted earlier) is *carefully worded*. It speaks to:
   * Supervising construction of field hospitals and living centers
   * Helicopter operations
   * Improving “overall health and sanitation” in a warzone This is classic bureaucratic smoke—**cover narrative** for deeper ops.
* **Timeline Syncs** He served during the **peak years** of covert Laos engagement:
   * Laos ops reached operational crescendo by **1968–71**, matching **your grandpa’s rank, clearance, and Vietnam-adjacent command roles**

I hope that this post belongs in this sub, if not please remove it and I'll try elsewhere, but does anyone have any advice on how to get a little more clarity on what he could've done in Laos?",3,1744689277.0,MilitaryStories,1,1.0,False

That said, I could sense she was hesitant and losing interest midway I was talking but she was also asking me questions so I don't know if she is interested anymore.

I offered to drop her but she politely said, she lived just a block from the coffee shop and she'd walk back. We hugged goodbye and she said, it was nice meeting me (albeit in a customary way and didn't feel from the heart).

She didn't text me back yet but also didn't unmatch me on Hinge yet.

1jzihv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jzihv6/new_sensitivity_to_caffeine_after_tapering_down/,New Sensitivity to Caffeine After Tapering Down Intake,"Hi, a couple months ago, I began reducing my caffeine intake. I was a night shift worker and probably drinking the equivalent of 4 cups of coffee a day/night. I took some time off to regulate my circadian rhythm and cut back from 4 cups of coffee to 2 cups of green tea. As well as only having green tea in the morning or early afternoon. I went through very intense withdrawals and potentially some electrolyte/mineral imbalances but I am feeling so much better. 

At first during the withdrawal process, having my daily coffee would help my symptoms. But progressively, I became more intolerant to coffee to the point I would have only a sip and feel wired. Within seconds I would feel anxious and incredibly stimulated. I would feel my chest tighten or my heart rate increase. I was quite concerned about the severity of my withdrawal symptoms and what quitting cold turkey would do to me. At the time, my blood pressure and heart rate were very high and I was having palpitations and some neurological concerns. So I tried drinking green tea to relieve some of those symptoms and continue the tapering process. I have been tolerating green tea great and don’t feel those negative effects of caffeine when I drink it. 

Yesterday, I was at a restaurant that served me black tea at the end of my meal. I had a tiny sip and once again, within seconds, I felt incredibly stimulated and anxious. 

Has anyone experienced this while they were cutting back or quitting caffeine? And is there any reason one could tolerate green tea but be sensitive to coffee and black tea? I know green tea has less caffeine than the others, but it only required a tiny sip to induce this reaction… so I don’t necessarily think it’s a caffeine dose issue

We had a couple of classes in the morning, and on one of the first mornings, she was late to class so I texted her, ""girl wya"" and she came running sweating with an iced London fog and said she got my favorite coffee order. And at this point I think she's flirting w me, so I tell her tysm and I'll buy coffee and we should go to a cafe next weekend (that never happened). Then a couple of weeks later, she told me to come out to the quad to study together and I went out, ate some of her snacks, judged her snacks and gave her some of mine (gummy peach rings) and she said it was disgusting bc it was so sweet. Ok. Whatever, I LOVE high blood sugar. Next time we hang out, she gets me some peach gummy rings as a gift bc she remembered that I like them.
Ok, so far I can imagine friends doing this. But here's the kicker... This was last semester, and since January we've been going to each other dorms and cooking together. She sometimes walks to my dorm to give me food or we get something and eat it together while watching a movie. 
A couple of days ago... We were making food in my dorm, and when she came over, she said that she remembered to bring slippers (bc I wear slippers around my dorm), and she said she would keep her slippers in my dorm, and I was like that's chill.

Hope to hear from you.

[OPENING ANNOUNCER] Coming up next on C-SPAN, we go live to the Pentagon briefing room, where Defense Secretary Les Aspin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell are set to provide an update on the latest developments in South Vietnam.

[00:00:30 – SECRETARY LES ASPIN] Good afternoon. I’ll start with a few key points about the current security situation in South Vietnam, and then General Powell will provide additional details. First, let me stress that what we are seeing in the Mekong Delta and several of these demilitarized provinces is not a part of some new offensive, but rather an intensification of localized insurgent activity. These incidents are disruptive, but our intelligence does not indicate any kind of coordinated national effort at this time. And there has been no uptick in material losses. Secondly, U.S. support remains steadfast. We continue to work with our regional partners to ensure stability in the region. U.S. advisors, logistics, and support for all three zones of engagement—land, sea, and air—will remain in place, and President Kerrey reiterates his commitment to our allies. Finally, I want to emphasize that our long-term strategy is not changing. The United States has maintained a presence in the region for decades, and until some form of peaceful agreement is reached between all parties, our goals will not change. We have adapted over time, but our core objectives remain consistent. And now General Powell.

[00:02:00 – GENERAL COLIN POWELL] Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I’ll add that our presence continues to operate with utmost efficiency and precision. The U.S. 7th Fleet is actively patrolling to prevent smuggling operations that supply Viet—cough—that supply local insurgents. Additionally, we have doubled our intelligence-sharing efforts with local commanders to anticipate and neutralize potential threats well before they emerge. We are seeing a continuation of asymmetric tactics from the insurgents—targeted bombings in urban centers, and efforts to undermine democratic and civic institutions. These tactics are familiar, and they have not changed, nor have they proven any more effective. What has changed is our ability to counter them. Advances in reconnaissance, drone surveillance, and precision strikes have allowed us to mitigate their impact significantly. We are taking active preparations to secure this year’s Tet celebrations to ensure they are protected and no incidents can occur. That said, to reiterate what Secretary Aspin and indeed the President have been saying: This is a long-term mission, and we have complete and total confidence in the ability of our servicemen and women to remain committed to the stability of the region. We have every reason to believe our efforts are succeeding.

[00:04:30 – REPORTER QUESTION] General Powell, is the President concerned that this situation in Vietnam could be a distraction from ongoing spending negotiations with Republican leadership?

[00:04:45 – GENERAL COLIN POWELL] I won’t comment on domestic policy matters and I’ll defer any budget discussions to the White House press team.

A high-traffic location like an office building, factory, school, or hospital will typically generate more sales than a less populated area. The density of locations within the route is also vital; a route with geographically concentrated locations minimizes travel time and fuel costs, maximizing the time spent servicing machines.

A dense route allows for more efficient restocking and maintenance, as the operator spends less time driving between locations. Look for routes with a mix of established, high-performing locations and potential for adding new sites to further increase revenue. Assess the accessibility of each location for restocking and maintenance, considering factors like parking availability and building access hours.

**Machine Types and Condition**

The types of vending machines included in the route and their condition are crucial factors. Modern machines with advanced features like cashless payment options, remote monitoring, and energy-efficient operation can attract more customers and reduce operating costs. Older machines may require more frequent repairs and maintenance, negatively impacting profitability.

Examine the age and condition of each machine on the route, noting any signs of wear and tear, malfunctioning components, or outdated technology. Determine if the machines are compatible with the types of products you intend to sell and whether they can be upgraded or replaced in the future. Diversification of vending machine types, such as snack, soda, coffee, or even specialized items, can appeal to a broader customer base and increase overall sales.

**Product Mix and Pricing Strategies**

The products offered in the vending machines significantly impact revenue. A well-chosen product mix caters to the specific needs and preferences of the target audience at each location. For example, a vending machine in a gym might focus on healthy snacks and protein drinks, while one in an office building might offer more traditional snack and beverage options.

Assess the existing product mix on the route, considering whether it aligns with the demographics and preferences of the locations served. Evaluate the pricing strategies used for each product, ensuring they are competitive yet profitable. Consider experimenting with different product offerings and pricing strategies to optimize sales and maximize revenue potential.

**Route Contract Agreements and Terms**

The contract agreements with the locations where the vending machines are placed are essential. These agreements outline the terms of the vending machine placement, including the percentage of revenue shared with the location owner (commissions), the length of the contract, and any exclusivity clauses.

Review all contract agreements associated with the route, paying close attention to the commission rates, contract durations, and renewal terms. Shorter contracts may offer more flexibility but also increase the risk of losing a location. Longer contracts provide more security but may limit your ability to renegotiate terms or adjust pricing strategies. Negotiate favorable contract terms whenever possible to maximize profitability and minimize risk.

**Financial Performance and Profitability**

A thorough analysis of the route's financial performance is critical before making a purchase. This includes reviewing historical sales data, operating expenses, and net profit margins. Understanding the route's financial performance helps you determine its true value and potential for future growth.

Request detailed financial records for the route, including sales reports, expense summaries, and profit and loss statements. Analyze the data to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement. Calculate key financial metrics like gross revenue, operating expenses, net profit, and return on investment (ROI) to assess the route's profitability. Consider conducting a due diligence process to verify the accuracy of the financial information provided.

**Growth Potential and Scalability**

The potential for future growth and scalability is an important consideration for any vending machine route investment. A route with limited growth potential may not be a worthwhile investment, while one with opportunities for expansion can provide significant returns over time.

Assess the potential for adding new locations to the route, expanding the product mix, or implementing new technologies to increase sales and efficiency. Consider the geographic area covered by the route and whether there are opportunities to expand into neighboring areas. Evaluate the scalability of the business model and whether it can be replicated in other markets or regions.

 ## Core Benefits

Investing in a vending machine route can provide numerous benefits, offering both financial rewards and lifestyle flexibility. These benefits can significantly improve your financial outlook and provide a pathway to entrepreneurial success.

**Passive Income Generation:** Vending machine routes can generate passive income once established, requiring less active management compared to other businesses. Restocking and maintenance can be scheduled, allowing for flexible working hours and the potential for supplemental income. This allows for a more balanced lifestyle while generating revenue.

By outsourcing some of the operational tasks, such as restocking or maintenance, even greater passivity can be achieved. This can free up your time to focus on other business ventures or personal pursuits, making it an attractive option for those seeking a more hands-off investment. The consistency of income from established locations provides a stable financial foundation.

**Scalability and Growth Potential:** Vending machine routes are highly scalable, allowing you to expand your business by adding more machines and locations over time. The initial investment can be relatively low, making it accessible to entrepreneurs with limited capital. As your business grows, you can reinvest profits to further expand your route and increase revenue.

The scalability of the vending machine business model allows you to grow your business at your own pace, gradually increasing your income and building a valuable asset. You can diversify your vending machine offerings by adding different types of machines or specialized products, further increasing revenue potential. The potential for expansion and diversification makes vending machine routes an attractive investment for ambitious entrepreneurs.

**Flexibility and Control:** Owning a vending machine route offers significant flexibility and control over your business. You can set your own hours, choose your own products, and manage your business according to your own priorities. This level of autonomy allows you to create a business that aligns with your values and goals.

The ability to set your own hours and manage your business remotely allows for a flexible lifestyle, making it an attractive option for those seeking more control over their time. You can choose the products that you want to offer, catering to the specific needs and preferences of your target audience. This level of control allows you to create a business that is both profitable and fulfilling.

The cost of a vending machine route varies significantly depending on several factors, including the number of machines, the locations, the age and condition of the machines, and the financial performance of the route. Routes can range from a few thousand dollars for a small, local route to hundreds of thousands of dollars for a larger, more established route. It's important to conduct thorough due diligence to determine the fair market value of the route based on its financial performance and assets.

**How much time and effort is required to manage a vending machine route?**

The time and effort required to manage a vending machine route depends on the size and complexity of the route, as well as the level of automation and outsourcing used. A small route with a few machines might require only a few hours per week for restocking and maintenance, while a larger route with dozens of machines could require significantly more time.

    * **Machine Age:** Average machine age of 5 years, with cashless payment systems.
    * **Contract Terms:** Average contract length of 3 years, with 10% commission rates.

    * **Machine Age:** Mixed machine ages, ranging from 2 to 10 years, some without cashless options.
    * **Contract Terms:** Shorter contract lengths, averaging 1 year, with varying commission rates (5-15%).

#### Budget-Friendly Vending Route (Route C)
    * **Location Density:** Low density, primarily in smaller businesses and retail shops.
    * **Machine Age:** Older machines, averaging 10+ years, requiring more frequent maintenance.
    * **Contract Terms:** Month-to-month agreements, offering flexibility but less security.

### Key Differences Summary
Route A offers a higher density and newer machines, but also commands a higher price due to its established locations and favorable contract terms. Route B provides a more affordable entry point with growth potential, but requires more active management and potential upgrades to older machines.

 ## Ideal User Profile

Identifying the ideal user profile helps tailor your vending machine route investment to your specific skills and experience. Understanding who benefits most from this type of business guides strategic decision-making.

**Experienced Business Owners:** Individuals with prior business ownership experience, particularly in sales, marketing, or operations, are well-suited for managing a vending machine route.

While some active management is required for restocking and maintenance, these tasks can be scheduled and outsourced, allowing for a more hands-off approach. This makes it a good option for individuals seeking supplemental income or a business that can be managed alongside other commitments.

**Entrepreneurs Focused on Scalability:** Ambitious entrepreneurs looking to build a scalable business will find the vending machine route model attractive.

I maintain a strict diet. I work at nights, so the breakfast is completely skipped. For 'lunch' I ate and apple or a protein bar with the lowest calories which I can find (or if I can't find any, I ate a skinny chocolate bar). For dinner I eat mostly grilled veggies with some kind of lean protein, or vegetable soup (with white beans, kale, broccoli, carrots and peppers). 

I allow myself one little takeaway a week, mostly a hamburger with chips, or fish and chips, or kebab and a medium sized pitta bread. That's it. I drink only diet coke or zero red bull, or only black coffee (no milk, and two teaspoon of sugar).

# Winning Cup 2025: Top Picks & Expert Buying Guide

The ""winning cup"" isn't just one product; it's a concept encompassing various types of cups designed for optimal performance, whether in sports, competitive events, or even everyday activities. This guide explores top contenders in the market, analyzing their features, benefits, and suitability for different users. It aims to provide you with the knowledge to make an informed decision when choosing the perfect ""winning cup"" for your specific needs in 2025.

[[Browse top-rated winning cup on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=winning+cup)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The specific features of a ""winning cup"" vary greatly depending on its intended use. A hydration cup for athletes will have different features than a trophy cup awarded in a competition, or even a menstrual cup designed for leak-proof protection. However, several key attributes are generally desirable across different categories.

**Material Durability and Safety:** The cup's material is crucial for both its longevity and the user's safety.

Whether it's a stainless steel water bottle, a shatter-resistant plastic sports cup, a solid metal trophy cup, or medical-grade silicone menstrual cup, the material must be durable enough to withstand regular use and potential impacts. Crucially, it must be free from harmful chemicals like BPA or phthalates to ensure safe contact with liquids or the body. The choice of material often dictates the weight, feel, and overall lifespan of the cup.

**Insulation Performance (If Applicable):** For hydration cups intended to maintain temperature, insulation is a vital feature.

Double-walled vacuum insulation is the gold standard, capable of keeping beverages cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 12 hours. Lower-end cups might use less effective insulation techniques, leading to quicker temperature changes. The effectiveness of the insulation also affects the cup's external temperature, preventing condensation or burns.

**Ergonomics and Grip:** How comfortable and secure the cup is to hold and use plays a significant role in the overall experience.

Ergonomic designs, such as contoured shapes or textured grips, enhance handling and reduce the risk of accidental drops. This is particularly important during strenuous activities or in situations where precision is required. A well-designed grip can significantly improve comfort and control, making the cup a more natural extension of the user's hand.

**Leak-Proof Design:** Regardless of the cup's purpose, a reliable leak-proof design is essential to prevent spills and messes.

This typically involves a secure lid with a tight seal, often incorporating silicone gaskets or specialized locking mechanisms. The leak-proof design should be effective even when the cup is tilted, inverted, or subjected to pressure. This feature provides peace of mind and allows users to confidently carry the cup in bags or backpacks without worrying about leaks.

**Capacity and Portability:** The cup's size and weight influence its practicality for various activities.

A larger capacity is ideal for extended use without frequent refills, while a smaller, more compact design is better suited for portability. The ideal balance between capacity and portability depends on the user's specific needs and preferences. Considerations include the weight of the cup when full, its dimensions, and whether it can easily fit into cup holders or bags.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Hygiene is paramount, and the cup's design should facilitate easy and thorough cleaning.

Wide-mouth openings allow for easy access to the interior, and dishwasher-safe components simplify the cleaning process. Some cups may feature removable parts or specialized cleaning tools to ensure all areas can be reached and properly sanitized. This is especially important for cups used with sugary drinks or in environments where hygiene is a major concern.

 ## Core Benefits

The core benefits of choosing the right ""winning cup"" extend beyond its basic functionality. It provides advantages that directly impact performance, convenience, and even cost savings.

**Enhanced Hydration and Performance:** For athletes and active individuals, a high-quality hydration cup ensures optimal hydration levels, leading to improved performance and endurance.

By providing easy access to water or sports drinks, the cup helps maintain electrolyte balance and prevent dehydration-related fatigue. This translates to increased energy levels, better focus, and enhanced overall athletic performance. A reliable, easy-to-use hydration cup is an essential tool for anyone striving to achieve their peak physical potential.

**Increased Convenience and Portability:** A well-designed cup makes it easy to carry beverages on the go, reducing the need for disposable bottles and cups.

This is particularly beneficial for commuters, travelers, and anyone who wants to stay hydrated or caffeinated throughout the day. The convenience of having a reusable cup readily available encourages healthy habits and reduces reliance on less sustainable options. A portable, leak-proof cup provides freedom and flexibility, allowing users to enjoy their favorite beverages wherever they go.

**Long-Term Cost Savings:** Investing in a durable, reusable cup can save money over time by eliminating the need to purchase disposable cups or bottled beverages.

While the initial cost of a high-quality cup may be higher, the long-term savings can be substantial. Over time, the cumulative cost of disposable cups and bottled drinks can far exceed the price of a reusable option. Furthermore, choosing a reusable cup contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing waste and promoting responsible consumption.

**Improved Hygiene and Health:** Using a personal cup reduces exposure to germs and bacteria that may be present on shared or poorly cleaned cups.

This is particularly important in public places or during travel, where hygiene standards may vary. Owning a personal cup allows users to control the cleanliness and sanitation, minimizing the risk of illness. A clean, personal cup promotes better health and well-being, especially for individuals with sensitivities or allergies.

**Environmental Sustainability:** Choosing a reusable cup contributes to reducing plastic waste and promoting a more sustainable lifestyle.

By avoiding disposable cups, users actively participate in reducing pollution and conserving natural resources. This small but significant action can have a positive impact on the environment and help create a more sustainable future. Choosing a reusable cup is a tangible way to demonstrate commitment to environmental responsibility and promote eco-conscious behavior.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about choosing the right ""winning cup,"" addressing common concerns and providing helpful information.

**What type of cup is best for hot beverages?**

Insulated stainless steel cups are generally the best choice for hot beverages. They retain heat effectively and are safe for use with hot liquids. Double-walled construction prevents the cup from becoming too hot to handle and keeps the beverage warm for extended periods. Always ensure the cup is designed for hot liquids to avoid potential damage or safety issues.

**How do I properly clean and maintain my cup?**

Most reusable cups can be cleaned with soap and water, and many are dishwasher-safe. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning recommendations. For stainless steel cups, avoid using abrasive cleaners that can scratch the surface. Regularly cleaning your cup is crucial to prevent the buildup of bacteria and maintain its hygiene.

**Are plastic cups safe for long-term use?**

Not all plastic cups are created equal. Choose plastic cups that are BPA-free and made from food-grade materials. Avoid using plastic cups with hot liquids unless they are specifically designed for that purpose. Over time, plastic can degrade and leach chemicals, so consider replacing plastic cups periodically or opting for alternatives like stainless steel or glass.

**How do I choose the right size cup for my needs?**

Consider how you plan to use the cup. For short commutes or quick workouts, a smaller cup may suffice. For longer activities or extended periods without access to refills, a larger cup is more practical. Think about the types of beverages you'll be drinking and choose a size that accommodates your typical consumption habits. A good rule of thumb is to err on the side of slightly larger to ensure you have enough capacity.

1jzhwid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1jzhwid/got_rejected_after_two_great_dates_not_sure_why/,"Got rejected after two great dates, not sure why and feeling really down","I (27M) matched with a girl (24F) and had a great start to our conversation. We planned our first date within the first day of speaking and met 5 days later. The date itself went great and it was just simple coffee. We had a lot of similarities. For our second date we went to a museum and my honest assessment was that it was even better than the first date. We had intimate conversations, held hands, and also grabbed dinner towards the end. The entire night we were sharing our lives and laughing and commenting on art. We did not kiss because she was drinking during dinner and I was not due to some health reasons. I felt a little weird going in for a kiss while being sober and was just being careful she wouldn’t find it creepy the next day. However I did hug her goodbye when I dropped her home. She invited me over for dinner and that was the plan for next weekend. We were texting back and forth like usual since we started talking but she went quiet a day before. I checked in on the day we were supposed to meet asking how she is and we could always go outside (no pressure on hosting dinner at her home). I didn’t hear back for two days and assumed the worst but was in denial. Eventually got the text that shes not interested right now in me. She did say she thinks im a nice person and we can be friends. 

Honestly heartbroken and upset at myself for obsessing over her for weeks. I didn’t go over a lot of the details but there were things like her gestures and what she was saying that made me feel like I was ‘the one’ for her (I know it’s corny). She also got me a gift on our second date and while it was a small item, I was really blown away because not even my family gives me gifts. I feel like a fool because I felt I was falling in love with her and she was going to be the one. 

There was one moment during the museum night when we were finding a place to eat on my phone. She leaned in close to me and hugged me while both of us searched together. I broke up with my girlfriend a year ago (a whole different story but one of heartbreak) and this small gesture was enough to make me believe in genuine human connection again and I honestly felt like the most lucky man alive. 

I haven’t replied to her message as yet and just really confused and saddened by the whole situation. I’m not sure what happened so suddenly or what caused the sudden change of heart. I didn’t pick up any negative signals even two days before we were supposed to meet for dinner. I took a look at her profile and she seems to have updated one of her pictures so it doesn’t seem like there’s anything going on in her personal life to warrant such behavior and she’s still actively searching. It pains me to say it but I guess I wasn’t the one for her. I haven’t been on a date with a new person in a long time but suddenly got attached to this stranger and teared up last night crying in bed after her text. 

Unrelated to the question / headline but I’ve been thinking today how it’s weird how sensitive we are as human beings. How easily we can get attached in our longing for love and being accepted. It’s unhealthy but ever since the museum night, I’ve been replaying the whole night in my head every single day. It feels like yesterday instead of roughly two weeks ago. We were not in a relationship and she doesn’t owe me any commitment but I guess I’m at fault here for not keeping my emotions in check and desiring love and connection from a stranger. What I hoped would be the girl of my dreams was just another date gone wrong. 

It would be helpful to hear advice on how best to move on from the past few weeks and maybe what I should reply to her. ",3,1744687216.0,Bumble,4,1.0,False

1jzhvyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jzhvyw/i_feel_like_im_not_allowed_to_grieve_the_death_of/,I feel like I'm not allowed to grieve the death of my childhood best friend and it's killing me.,"I'm 25F, and I found out last December that my childhood best friend, Nate, had died in April 2024. 

I haven't really touched Facebook since the pandemic and logged on around Christmas time this past December to message a few relatives that live in a different country. I was curious to see what I've missed and did a quick scroll threw my feed and stopped at post from my former best friend's mom saying how heart broken she was to spend his birthday and the holidays without him for the first time. 

I scrolled on her page and found the obituary links from the April prior. He died from epilepsy in his sleep. I was crushed and felt like the world crumbled beneath me and now all I feel is guilt. 


We were in first grade when we first met, table buddies in homeroom and cubby neighbors in art class. English is not my first language and I absolutely couldn't keep up in class or social settings. I was, and still am, am anxiety filled person. Nate was the first person to really try to be friends with me, despite the language barrier. He reached out his hand and introduced me to his friends and we played together during recess. He made me feel safe (I was bullied for my accent, my weight and my being Asian often), he made me feel included and wanted and I genuinely owe my happinest childhood moments to him. 

We imagined worlds into existence on that playground, he read Harry Potter and Percy Jackson books to me during lunch so that I could enjoy them too and he was SOOOOO good making us feel like we were in those books along with the characters. It was only years later when I read them myself I found out he would add his own spin on the narratives or just try to bulk up the world building. Nate, our 3 other friends and I... I thought it would be like that forever. 

5th grade was the first school year we all weren't in the same homeroom and it sucked, but at least we had recess. Slowly but surely through the school year Nate and the rest of the boys stopped including me in their games, stopped asking to hangout and all of a sudden the lunch table was ""boys only"" I was crushed. I only ever really had them as friends so to be shunned and the only one to be shunned felt like absolute shit. The last quarter of school I found out I was moving a few towns over so I just stayed to myself until that school year was done. Me, the ever dramatic and hurt 5th grader decided that writing them a letter each and putting it in their year books after end of term signing would be a good idea. 

I was young, dramatic and deeply hurt. Each friend got a short paragraph, but Nate got at least 2 pages of me opening my heart to him and telling him how hurt and lonely he made me feel. How much I hated him for abandoning me with no explanation. Slipping the letter in his year book before school bus pick-up was the last time I saw him.

This was a time before any of us had phones or social media so I didn't hear from him or any of them until end of middle school. I made my Facebook account end of 8th grade and shortly after received plenty of friend requests from people I knew from grade school, one of them being from nate. 

I accepted his request and he just kept ""poking"" me in there every few weeks or so. Eventually he messaged me during sophomore year and said he was sorry that he hurt me. Turned out one of the other guys in our group, Willy, developed a crush on me and in order to avoid ME causing any kootie drama they just all ignored me so Willy could get over me? Idk the thought process of a 10 year old explained through the mind of a hormonal 15 year old made a very stupid and confusing paragraph.... I was dealing with bullying and self harming at that point in my life and really lashed out at him in response. I mean, I lost all my friends because unfortunately someone liked me to much? I was outcasted due to something completely out of my control? 15 year old me couldnt handle that explanation and blew up at him. Said some nasty stuff, called him and the rest of them some colorful words I as an adult wouldnt even use. I told him to never contact me again, it would just hurt too much. 

Radio silence for 2 years, he would leave the occasional ""great job"" ""happy for you"" comment on my accomplishments posts. He calls me through messenger the night before his school graduated highschool, I would graduate a week later. He would be moving to a new state come the fall semester for Uni, I would be doing the same, just on the opposite end of the country. I was in a better head space and we really just talked about what happened in 5th grade and everything that happened between. He told me he still had the letter I wrote him and that what they did was stupid. I told him that I was harsh the last time we messaged each other. He asked me if I could ever forgive him and the gang and I said as much I wanted to, I couldn't. 

18 year old me was a deeply hurt and troubled girl. She was depressed and recovering from an ED, SA survivor and just generally not willing to let anyone close. I told him he was my first friend and my first real betrayal and that life hasn't been kind to me since the day they turned me away at lunch all those years ago. We were crying. He said he understood and that I was invited to his graduation party if I ever changed my mind and hung up. I didn't go. That was the last time we talked. 

We didn't necessarily leave on bad terms, that talk did heal a lot of hurt from my childhood, but we still left off as strangers that once loved and cared for the other and that will always suck. Over the next few years we would congratulate each other on awards and milestones through Facebook, but the kind of shallow congrats you'd give to a coworker you hardly know. Every now and then I would get the urge to reach out, found myself in his city a handful of times and wondered if I should reach out and ask to grab coffee but decided against it. I wish I hadn't.

We were kids when we had a falling out. I knew it was stupid for being so guarded against him all these years, but I was just so hurt and when I found out he was gone it felt like I didn't even have the right to grieve him and I didn't expect it to hurt as much as it did but oh my life, it felt like a black hole spawned in my chest.

Last week was the anniversary of his passing and it still doesn't feel fair or real. I feel like shit for not just forgiving him when I had the chance. I obviously still cared for him at some capacity or else I would have just blocked his account when he tried to add me on FB all those years ago. God, why didn't I just forgive him?

I feel genuinely so fucking angry with myself. When you love someone as a kid (romanticly or platonically) it englufs you. When I say Nate was my first and best friend as a kid I mean he was an integral brick in my life's foundation. And now he's just gone and i still can't wrap my brain around it.

I will always remember the boy with the perpetually crooked glasses that reached out his hand and asked me to play make believe with him in the first day of first grade. I will always love the boy that would let me play on his Nintendo DS because my family was too poor to buy toys and games or would give me half his lunch at school during the 2008 recession and free school lunch was cut in our district and he didn't want me to starve. I will forever mourn the friendship we had and the friendship I foolishly kept trying to distance myself from. 

Thank you for reading to the weird, shy girl at lunch, she grew up to love books and has Percy Jackson books in her personal library with little tabs where you put your personal flare to the story. Thank you for helping me learn how to socialize and be true to my art, I'm still shy but I found a group of artsy people that support me. And thank you for trying your best to make it up to me, I am so sorry I didn't try harder too. 

I turned 25 this year, an age you'll never be. I thought of you and how you would say you would protect me since a knight always protects little ladies and how I would roll my eyes and whine that you were only a month older than me. Turning 25 was sad, knowing this was the first year I would be older than you. 

Anyway if you're still reading this, random stranger from the Internet, don't make the same mistake. If youve fallen out with someone you really cared about in the past, but you have the slightest thought of reaching out to them to talk, I recommend you do. I don't care if it's to finalize somethings before blocking them or if it's to patch things up. If even the smallest bit of you wants to talk to them and they express the same to you, just do it. You won't always get a chance so just take it.",7,1744687169.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1jzhu60,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1jzhu60/im_pretty_sure_that_my_wifes_been_peeking_at_me/,I’m pretty sure that “My Wife's Been Peeking At Me From Around Corners” is actually the jumbled account of a paranoid schizophrenic who killed his wife.,"I was listening to this story today and something stuck to me. At about 54min into the video, Benjamin is talking about the possibility of having his wife committed, and casually mentions that his wife could only be held at a hospital for 72 hours without being a demonstrable threat.  

That’s an oddly specific bit of information to have tucked away. Benjamin stated early in the story that his wife has no history of mental illness. I think it’s possible that he knows that information because he himself has been subjected to it.  

It’s possible that Benjamin is an unreliable narrator, and that his record of events is half-remembered lucid moments mixed with half-remembered hallucination, some of which is told out if chronological order, or with gaps of time missing.

I decided to go back through the story from the beginning, so here is a highly speculative list of some things that I may have found.

Also, sorry if this is all old news. I’m late to the party.

————————————————————————

1. The title. Everything about it screams paranoia.

2. Lynn gets scared halfway into The Shining. What happens by that point that could be considered scary? Maybe Jack starts exhibiting behaviors that hit a little too close to home. 

3. In what feels like a complete non sequitur, Benjamin follows his comment about The Shining by stating his wife has no history of mental illness.

4. After the first peeking incident, neither Benjamin nor Lynn talk about it; possibly because the wife doesn’t even know that it’s occurred. This would also explain why there’s no alleviating conversation after her “prank”, and why she’s just asleep after supposedly skittering across a floor on all fours. I think she’s asleep when Benjamin goes upstairs because she’s been asleep the whole time.

5. At that point, Benjamin starts wondering if he dreamt the whole thing. Some part of him recognizes that what he experienced doesn’t make sense.

6. When Benjamin asks her about it the next day, she says that she has no idea what he’s talking about, but she also “frowns over her coffee”. She isn’t just confused by his question. She’s sad or worried that he’s asking it. She then laughs (nervous laughter?), gives Benjamin a hug, and as Benjamin remembers it, says that “he creeps her out all the time”. Benjamin describes her saying this as if it’s a lighthearted thing, but it’s completely out of place. I think maybe what she really said was  something more like “you’re scaring me”.

7. Benjamin starts seeing her peeking at him more and more, and from all kinds of irrational places. These episodes then go away for a couple of weeks, before coming back even worse. That’s a pattern present in hallucinations from schizophrenia. 

8. 29min into the video, Benjamin actually describes being paranoid, and says he felt “stupid, and a little crazy”. Maybe that was a moment of lucidity.

9. After the two week lull, the peeking incidents start to get worse, and Lynn goes away to stay with a friend. Benjamin doesn’t say why, or who the friend is. Benjamin then describes the bathroom scene, which supposedly took place while Lynn is staying with her friend.

10. In his first account of the bathroom incident, he watches through the shower curtain as Lynn’s blurry form backs out of the bathroom, before slamming the bathroom the door with enough force to rattle the mirror. This memory involves “slamming”, “glass”, Benjamin being angry, Benjamin yelling, and Benjamin pounding a “door”. If Benjamin does have schizophrenia, this could be a half remembered mix of actual experience and hallucination that are further explained later.

11. During the bathroom incident Benjamin sees Lynn shaking (supposedly with excitement), keeping her hands up at her chest, and making a raspy moaning sound. He could be misremembering/hallucinating her shaking with fear, her arms up in a defensive position, moaning in pain, and given the raspy description, possibly being strangled.

12. Benjamin says that after the bathroom incident, he starts getting a bunch of texts and calls from Lynn saying “why did you leave like that”, “I love you”, “please come home”, and similar. Those messages seem more appropriate if directed at someone she loves who just flipped out, and stormed out of the house with no explanation, or if directed at an abuser she still feels attached to. She wouldn’t know what else to say. 

13. Once again, according to Benjamin, she was staying with a friend, and wouldn’t have been when around when any of this happened, which doesn’t make any sense. This may hint at Benjamin mixing misremembered details from different events.

14. While at Chris’ house, Benjamin says a few things that seem relevant regarding his perception. First, he mentions that his perception of time is off; something the effect of such and such number of hours can feel like forever when you’re scared. *If Benjamin’s perception of time is messed up, he may confuse half remembered lucid moments with half remembered hallucinations.* Secondly, even at Chris’ house, he mentions that every time he closes his eyes, he sees Lynn peeking at him. This comes across as a paranoid hallucination regarding the night before, but what if this isn’t the first time he’s had this hallucination?

15. At around 39min into the video, Benjamin recounts the bathroom incident, but this time describes seeing Lynn slip inside the bathroom closet, then slam the bathroom door shut. For one, she couldn’t slam the bathroom door shut from inside a closet. Secondly, his new account of the events conflicts with him watching her blurry figure back out of the bathroom before the door slammed shut. Not only is his story inconsistent, he is also now fully convinced of contradictory details.

16. While supposedly at Chris’ house, Benjamin sees Lynn’s face pressed up against the glass of a window, and smiling wider than before; as if absolutely filled with delight. He then slams his palm against the window and yells “go home!”. I think this is him misremembering his wife smiling in their wedding photo before he breaks it. He says after he slammed the glass, she didn’t move. That’s because he was actually looking at her picture. Her smile “grew as if she had never been more elated”. That’s because it was the smile she wore on their wedding day. 

17. There were two drips of drool supposedly running down the window from his wife’s face. I think this may have actually been blood running down the picture from where he broke the glass.

18. When he yells go home, I think she does exactly that. I think this memory actually  occurred during one of his outbursts at their home, and is when she goes to stay with “a friend”; her mother.

19. When Benjamin, his brother, and sister-in-law investigate outside window that he supposedly slammed, they find imprints in the soil, but they’re too small to be human, and appear to have been left by animals. There’s only one other place animals are mentioned in the story. Animals whose eyes had been removed, and definitely not by the only person in the story who has an obsession with eyes and the feeling of being watched.

20. After pounding the “window”, Benjamin’s brother and sister-in-law call to him “down the stairs”, and seem concerned about him. I think Chris and his wife may have been present at Benjamin’s house, during the outburst where he broke the wedding picture. The picture was in a hallway near a stairway. 

21. Additionally, when Benjamin’s wife first mentions having never seen Lynn so upset, she says it as if she’s referencing an event that Benjamin was present for; as if he knows what she would be talking about. She then mentions that Lynn came to visit that same day. These could be referring to separate occasions that Benjamin interpreted as being one and the same. This might also explain why Benjamin’s sister-in-law didn’t find it weird that Lynn would ask if Benjamin was awake yet. Benjamin says he was on sleep meds that his brother gave him, but maybe he actually blacked out after leaving his house with Chris, and both Lynn and the sister-in-law were present and aware of that.

22. Benjamin describes his mother-in-law as having never approved of him. Maybe she knew there was something wrong with him, and was worried about her daughter being with him?

23. She’s irritated from the very beginning of their phone call. Why? Probably because her daughter was staying with her temporarily and filled in on the outbursts and mental issues.

24. During the call. Benjamin states that Lynn has been acting strangely, at which point he is interrupted. The response is irritated, and states that he’s been rambling, despite Benjamin having only provided a few words, by his account. Has he actually been rambling without realizing it?

25. When Benjamin asks his mother-in-law if she has noticed any possible mental health issues, there’s a long pause as if she is shocked he would ask such a question about Lynn, given his condition. The mother-in-law then asks if he’s joking and says it isn’t funny. A reasonable response if she doesn’t approve of him because he has the very issues he’s now accusing Lynn of having.

26. Benjamin gets the impression his mother-in-law knows more than she’s letting on (which she does. She knows Benjamin is schizophrenic). She then tells Benjamin with emphasis, and urgency, that *he* needs to seek professional help. Not her daughter.

27. When thinking back through the conversation, Benjamin picks up on her urgency, that she was extremely upset, that she was uncomfortable being direct about what kind help was needed, and especially on her emphasis that he needs to seek professional help. This sticks out in his mind, but he ultimately shrugs the conversation off by saying “maybe I was just desperate”. It’s probably the best he could come up with because he couldn’t fit it into his delusion.

28. When Lynn chose for her and Benjamin to move three states away from her mother, I think it was because Lynn knew about Benjamin’s condition, loved him anyway, and because the mother didn’t feel comfortable with Lynn marrying a man with severe psychological problems.

29. Benjamin becomes convinced that Lynn needs psychiatric help. I think this is him projecting.

30. When Benjamin and Chris go to Benjamin’s house to pick up his things, Chris asks why Benjamin looks under the couch. “He was looking at me like I was a moron”. More likely, he looked at Benjamin like he was crazy.

31. When they revisit Benjamin’s house to collect his things, a lot of Chris’ dialog doesn’t make any sense. All of that dialog is presented by Benjamin, and I think most of it either didn’t happen, or is being misremembered from 2 different visits that Chris made to that house. Example: When they enter the house, Benjamin and Chris are immediately confronted by the smell of rot, and find broken glass from the wedding photo. Chris supposedly takes this stride. He hardly even reacts when supposedly finding rows of eyes in the closet. 

32. When Benjamin finds Lynn hiding under the bed, Chris is first described as looking at or past Chris in terror, then at Lynn. He then supposedly asks Benjamin “are you alright”, and then nonsensically asks if she’s playing hide and seek. What Chris actually said during the visit is probably unknowable, but I think Chris’ look of terror was from seeing Lynn’s body hidden under the bed. When he asks Benjamin if he’s okay, I think it’s because he’s seeing Benjamin have an episode.

33. When Benjamin describes bumping into Chris as he tries to leave the bedroom, he says he felt his back collide with Chris. I think he was actually feeling Chris trying to hold him from behind to try to try and keep him under control. He may have also had to defend himself with a shard of glass, resulting in fresh wounds on Benjamin.

34. Benjamin describes Lynn bobbing her head sharply and very quickly back and forth, 2 movements, like a nod.  He also describes raspy moaning sounds. I think this is a vague recollection of the sounds and sights he witnessed while strangling her before breaking her neck. 

35. Supposedly, this is when Chris called the police, who recommended that Benjamin get a restraining order. I think this may have been a half remembered interaction after a Chris’ previous visit to pick Benjamin up after a fight with Lynn. 

36. The reason for the above point is (unless I’m misremembering this) Chris and his wife initially tell Benjamin he can stay with them for as long as he needs, but at the end of the story, Benjamin is living in a Motel. I think at that point Benjamin is on the run from the police, and due to Chris’s discoveries at Benjamin’s house, he’s no linger able to stay with them. If that’s true, the actual ending is that there is a killer on the loose who is still suffering the hallucinations that make him dangerous, which is a lot more satisfying.",3,1744687008.0,creepcast,2,0.8,False

Then I had to fill up the car with gas, and realized I was thirsty. Normally I would have bought an ice tea, instead, I got a bottle of water. While making supper I was peckish, and instead of grabbing a handful of something, I counted out 20 almonds and munched on those.

This may be a long one. 

My husband and I met in high school, we were good friends, adulting happened and life got in the way. We reconnected several years later in a gas station (lol), hit it back off immediately, I had just gotten out of a bad relationship several months prior and it seemed like things were just right. No red flags. No love-bombing. Nothing that would've raised any alarm. With that said, things progressively have gotten worse, and due to unresolved trauma from a past non-physical abusive relationship, I allowed it to spiral out of control, hence the boat I'm in now. 

We have been together for 9 years, 3 of those married. 
The problems didn't start until we married. 

I have to ask permission any time I do anything, go out with friends (I'm not talking clubbing here - I'm talking going to the bookstore, meeting for a coffee, etc. I'm not a partier), if I do go and he's gracious enough or in a good enough mood, then I'm accused of sneaking around behind his back (e.g., cheating - when I've never once given him any reason to believe so). I work full time, as does he, but I cook, I clean, I take care of the dogs, I walk the dogs, you name it. Any time I ask for help, I'm told that I work 7-8 hours in comparison to his 12's and that I don't work hard enough to be exhausted so he'll sit on the couch, lay in bed, or play video games while all of this is done. Now, to be fair, I don't have the most physically strenuous job in comparison to his, but mine is still very physically active (massage therapist). 
I've been struggling with my mental health for about a year and a half, and I've opened up to him about it just to be told I'm faking it for attention and to use it as a cop out in arguments (when I have an anxiety attack when I'm being called names). I had a pretty serious injury last year, and was off of work for months, and due to the nature of my field, I didn't have STD or LTD at the time so I was out of work - to which is held over my head on a constant basis and used as an argumentative jab in which hurts me as we had to rack up credit card debt to stay afloat among surgeries and being out of work for 3 to 4 months. Any time he's angry, it gets lashed out at me and I'm called any name under the sun, granted not just out of random but the minute we start arguing or something goes wrong. 

I've suggested couples therapy, have talked to my parents and in laws, addressing issues at hand or letting it slide, going away for a couple of days to my parent's home, if you name it, I've probably tried it.

With all of this said, I know I'm not perfect but I'm striving to be better, and grew up with biological parents for the first several years of my life that fought every single day and couldn't agree on anything - and not in a healthy way, and I told myself that I'd never allow it to happen to me. 

I do love him, but I've started to question the longevity of which how far I can be pushed at this point. 

I hate thinking of divorce but I'm so scared of living out the rest of my life walking on eggshells. Has anyone ever been in a situation like this and has it gotten better, did it get worse? I'm 32, want to have children and obviously the situation we are in is doesn't have the stability that I would want to bring children into the world to, and am just afraid he (30) is never going to grow up and I feel like I'm running out of time, as crude as that sounds. Not just for children, but to live my life and there's not a day that goes by that I don't just cry. We're never promised tomorrow and I just have no one to talk to so I apologize  for the long vent.

1jzhner,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jzhner/accidental_employee_of_the_week/,Accidental Employee of the Week,"TL;DR
I’m pretty sure I accidentally worked a full-time job for a week that I was never actually hired for. Nobody figured it out until Friday.


Last year I was in job-hunt mode, blasting out applications on Indeed like crazy. I’d tweak my resume a little for each one, fire it off, and hope something hit. At some point I must’ve applied for some kind of delivery driver job, but to be honest, I wasn’t keeping super close track of where I sent what.

Anyway, I get this call out of the blue from a guy named Trevor. He says he saw my resume, and wants to get me started right away. Like, training starts Monday. He talks fast, says I seem like a guy who can “run a route without having his hand held.” I had no clue what company he was with, but I just said “Sure, sounds good,” because it wasn’t the weirdest call I’d gotten that week.

So Monday rolls around, and I show up at this warehouse on the outskirts of town. Kind of run-down, but whatever, a job’s a job. I walk in, tell them my name, and a guy hands me a uniform shirt that’s one size too small. I just put it on and roll with it. Nobody asked for ID or paperwork or anything. They introduce me to a guy named Jerry who’s gonna train me. He seems decent. He says if everything looks good with my MVR (which I didn’t remember submitting), and my drug test (which I definitely never took) they’ll have me driving solo in a few days.

I spent four days riding around with Jerry. We delivered stuff to hardware stores, garages, small industrial supply shops. One day we dropped something off at a weird bait shop in the middle of nowhere that had a possum in a baby stroller by the front door. Nobody mentioned it, and I didn’t ask.

Anyway, Jerry and I actually got along great. The guy can talk. He told me stories about how he dislocated his jaw trying to eat a burrito too fast, how he once bowled a perfect game in 1989, and how he’s got serious opinions about what really happened to Jimmy Hoffa. I mostly just listened.

So Friday comes around. I’m in the breakroom, drinking the worst coffee I’ve ever tasted, when this manager I haven’t seen before walks in, looks at me, and says, “Who are you?”

I say, “Alex. Been out with Jerry all week.”

He just kind of squints at me and goes, “Yeah, but… you don’t work here.”

Turns out Trevor called the wrong Alex. Same first name, same last initial, totally different person. But because I showed up and just acted like I belonged, nobody questioned it. They even put me in the timeclock system. I had four full days on the books.

They were honestly pretty cool about it. Told me I could finish out the day, gave me a gas card as a “sorry for the mix-up,” and Jerry texted me later that week saying the new guy didn’t talk as much and that he missed me.

I did end up finding a real job not long after, but I still think about that place sometimes when I drive past it. Somewhere out there is another Alex who probably still is wondering if he passed that drug test Trevor had him to go take.

\---

James searched the entire flying island and could confidently say—and with quite a bit of relief—that there were no serial killers looking to violate his masculinity. No body parts, blackmarket, choppers. And no vans, black garbage bags, or whatever else someone needed to accomplish that goal.

He shivered again at the thought of being tied down. A monster cutting him up and stuffing him in said black bags.

It made him feel lucky to be… well, where this flying island was supposed to be exactly. The more he explored, the more confused he became. No evidence of this place having been lived in existed other than an untouched campfire, untouched and oddly stacked firewood, the dilapidated hut, and a few miscellaneous items.

No other buildings, three trees similar to the first one, and the river. No fish or critters. No farm or source of food other than a single, small bag of rice. Brown rice that looked like something people would be eaten in the B.C. years.

The rest was nothing more than stretches of grass surrounded by a sheer drop on all sides. Blue skies.

James wasn’t sure what would have been worse. If there was hope in the form of solid ground below him—though impossible to reach—or the immediate crushing of any hope or idea he would be able to escape this place.

Either he jumped and smacked headfirst into solid stone and earth or keep falling across endless skies.

*Don’t people die at certain velocities?*

He wasn’t sure. James could have sworn he had read somewhere that jumping from a ledge high enough would lead to his death before hitting the ground. Would that be more peaceful than smashing into solid ground? Or was it painful…?

*What am I doing?*

Why was he even contemplating ways to die? Hadn’t he been isekai-ed? A new world with new possibilities? A better, more improved chance at life with superpowers and a system?

James wanted to be something more. Wouldn’t he get an opportunity to be more than just a mundane clerk in a more mundane grocery store. No boss to breath over his shoulder. He would be in a world with magic and an equally important opportunity to chance upon a beauty in some remote village to love and dote on him! He couldn’t help but imagine having a supermodel wife without a supermodel complex.

Just a humble girl that fed him grapes when he was lying down. He could already imagine the…

He let out a deep breath.

*Not now! An ancient being might be watching me!*

Getting caught with his pants down was not part of his plan. The sheer embarrassment and mortifying situation made jumping off the edge like a good choice. He would definitely do it if that ever happened.

Or!

Maybe he would become a machiavellian ruler! Women would throw themselves at him and he would get to…

*Control!*

He shivered. Hands covering his face. Body shaking.

*Don’t die of embarrassment! Just long enough till we are isekai-ed to a new world! Princesses and humble peasants wait just for you! Or… Or fit adventurer ladies! Just until the tutorial is over!*

So James waited. And waited… then waited some more. At some point, his stomach began to announce its presence by rumbling like a thunderstorm. James found it odd. Was he supposed to get hungry in a magical tutorial dream? That seemed counterintuitive if they asked him. Then again, nobody showed up for him to complain to.

Where was the welcome sign? Even a welcome mat would have been fine. Wasn’t there a world that needed saving? James could only feel despondent the long this took. Even his raining hard-on passed as he found himself alone in a picturesque landscape.

No one to talk to. No one to bother him.

His stomach rumbled again. He blamed the depressed thoughts on it, being too hungry to think straight. Not to mention he never had a chance to eat breakfast yesterday due to a certain talkative granny. The plan had been to munch on cookies. Maybe even a bag of chips at work. Some hot coffee would have been perfect.

Add that to the time to get knocked out and be transported to the island. Wake up tucked perfectly in bed. Then finally all the time wasted searching the entirety of the island.

*Fuck it.*

He got up intending to make himself a bowl of rice. No salt, spices, or any extra ingredients like meat or vegetables. It would still be calorie dense and help sustain him, but it would taste terrible.

As he gathered water and carefully plucked one tied bunch of firewood for the campfire, James had an epiphany! This had to be a test! There was no way he would have been teleported into God knows where without something or someone being part of the process. They *were* watching! Judging him on his actions and accomplishments!

James was determined to pass it. The tonnes of survival reels and videos he watched in utter boredom at work had finally come through for him! A real chance at justifying all the hours he wasted!

He could imagine it already. Rebuilding the hut, if he recalled how! Growing more rice! Different types of rice cooked! James was sure he could accomplish them all. After all, he had watched videos of dainty girls going off grid and doing it. He should be able to, right?

Probably… Maybe.

Probably not, but it should count for something!

Extra stats! Experience points in his construction skill or even a special skill and class he would unlock. Eventually he would become a master architect! Or should he practice with a branch? Become a sword master. The possibilities were endless!

James hurried to start a fire. He grabbed a smaller stick and began to spin it between his palms like all the videos did. He spun and spun and spun the stick some more. At some point his arms had begun to burn with lactic acid as he struggled to get any spark or ember to appear.

It took nearly ten minutes of grueling arm workout to finally see the first spark…

Only for him to sputter and vanish an instant later. Unable to start a fire with it. It took three more punishing attempts, that left him exhausted, to get it right. But he eventually had a roaring fire blazing within the camp. He then used long sticks with enough girth to hold up his bowl. Filled with water and ancient brown rice.

James gulped as he watched it cook with an unpracticed eye. Rice cookers were not that expensive and instant meals were even easier to make. He had never needed to cook properly for himself or anyone that visited him. But again, he had watched a *tonne* of cooking videos. Enough that he had a general idea of what to do and what to look out for.

It took some time and urgent rushing back to the fire before he finally had a bowl of slightly burnt rice. And a steaming hot bowl he was too afraid to touch. He could already imagine the pain if he burned himself like an idiot. There were no ointments or drugstores on the island in an emergency.

A burn wound could get infected, leading to his death by attempted rice cooking.

James killed the fire and then let his bowl just sit there to cool down. He stared at it for a few seconds before growing bored. Exploring, washing his hands, and even throwing a few punches. James was starving by the time it was edible cool.

Even unsalted and bland rice tasted like heaven to his taste buds at this point.

*Congratulations on accomplishing a task!*

*Reward 12 exp*

*Reward 2 bronze coins*

*Congratulations! Level up!*

*Reward Rusty sword*

*Reward Broken shield*

*2 attribute points available*

Two bronze coins, the size of a nickel each, appeared in front of his eyes in the form of light. They harmlessly clinked on the ground. A rusty sword appeared next with its jagged point facing down. James had to jump out of the way. Barely dodging the sharp edge.

Half his rice spilled onto the ground.

“No! My rice!” James scrambled to pick up the clean parts.

Not even noticing the broken wood shield that appeared behind him. It fell on the rusty sword, snapping it in half.

James resolved himself to stuffing his face before any new items appeared directly in front of him. Enough rice had been sacrificed on this day already. No more rice blood needed to be spilled! Not when it could have been devoured. Sustaining him for more time. Who knows how long he’d be here or if he had enough food to last the entire time.

Dying of starvation was not a good way to go.

He shook his head. There were more important things to deal with!

First and foremost. This was a tutorial!

“Yes! I was right!” James felt joy bubble in his chest as he cuddled the rice bag to his chest. His most precious item.

His theory had been proven correct. In no good system or tutorial would he be sent to the new world at level zero. How could a twenty some year old be at the level of newborn babies? It would be immediately obvious to anyone with a lick of intelligence that he was otherworldly. Especially if he started blasting enemies at much higher levels.

Dunce villagers would be quick enough to figure it out.

James laid on his back. Staring at the clouds above. He could already imagine a million ways he could optimize his growth while stuffing his mouth with rice the entire time. Become an unbreakable tank? A glass canon nuke launcher? Or something in between?

Would he get better rewards for doing greater tasks? Exercising? Accomplishing not so easy goals?

He hoped there was magic. But he understood that a magical world meant magical fights and magical monsters. There would be a need for weapons skills. Swordsmanship. Spearmanship. Everything he could think of. Would those types of skills appear?

And most importantly, would it come with a proper guide? If he swung a blade ten thousand times all wrong, he wouldn’t suddenly become a master. He’d still be at point zero. Meaning he would be stuck as a novice with no way or no one to teach him.

What about unlocking purely magical attacks. Fireballs and launching tornadoes at his enemies. Eventually even fire tornados!

James got up from his seat. Done with his food, he made sure to clean the bowl and utensils. He put the small bag away inside one corner of the hut inside of the bowl.

*Clean room, clean mind!*

He had attribute points to allocate. Any and all advantages would be used.

Decades of gaming. Reading. Playing DnD. And a hundred different imagined scenarios would come to his aid at this moment. Yes, the mechanics may turn out different, but his vast experience should ease the burning curve.

That didn’t mean he didn’t feel the pressure. There was no save scumming here. Real life had real consequences. If his build was weak or had a glaring weakness, then he would be royally cursed to getting bodied by everyone and anyone that figured it out.

Glass cannons, the ones he had been so hype about a few moments ago, shouldn’t exist in a world if they kept dying to stray arrows at level one hundred. Simple natural selection demanded it. Basic survival skills would prevail over the extreme in basic circumstances.

It narrowed down his path forward.

Either survive and tank larger and larger attacks, healing afterwards. Or to never get hit and deal enormous amounts of damage in return.

The second option appealed to him. But after serious thought, wouldn’t he still be relatively susceptible to the proverbial *stray arrow*? He couldn’t outrun what he never saw coming. Perception and intuition could only do so much before he just got unlucky.

Especially area of effect attacks. And other more powerful things he couldn’t hope to escape.

Then again, a slow tank would end up in a similar conundrum. If James couldn’t dodge the attacks he couldn’t tank, then he’d die in the same way. Or constantly be wracked with torturous pain he would need to heal.

James resolved himself to create some form of hybrid class. The main point was survivability. Magic only made all situations more extreme.

He shook his head.

*It’s time!*

“Status!” James shouted. An expectant smile on his face. He couldn’t hide the excitement that oozed out of his being.

“Status?”

“System...?”

“*Attributes?!”*

*Shit! My attribute points!*

“Stats?” He whispered. Hope diminishing with every word.

“Statistics?”

“My Character!”

James Anderson did nothing but scream out random words and synonyms he could think of for the next hour. Then did nothing else but attempt to mentally think them instead of verbally saying the words for another hour. Doing his best to focus on the status screen appearing before his eyes.

Nothing happened.

He could feel the migraine and mental strain set in at some point—

*Congratulations on exceeding your limits!*

*Mental limits exceeded! First Mental limit exceeded!*

*1 attribute point to mental attributes available*

*Reward 7 exp*

*Reward 1 copper coin*

An insulting copper coin clinked onto the pile of items in front of him. Chipping the already rusted sword, adding insult to injury.

*What the FU—*

James closed his eyes. He took deep breaths. Hoping it would calm him down. He had been cussing too much ever since he got here. James needed to slow down. He let the air out slowly.

*What the hell am I supposed to do with attribute points I can’t allocate?! Who made this bullshit tutorial?! Dumbass! Motherf—*

James got up and ran to the river. He dunked his head into the cold water. Coming up only after he couldn’t hold his breath any longer. Then he dunked his head under again. He could feel his lungs burn and chest felt like it was going to explode.

But he needed to clear his head somehow—

*Congratulations on exceeding your limits!*

*Reward 1 exp*

*Congratulations! Level up!*

*Reward tattered robe*

*Reward stinky socks*

*Reward 10 copper coins*

*2 attribute points available*

Stinky socks and ripped up clothes dropped onto his soaked head. The coins bounced off his skull leaving dull pain behind.

*Sigh…*

1jzhmk9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jzhmk9,The White Mountain Boys  (2090),"Quick background… The world didn’t end all at once, it happened slowly. Between 2000 and 2022, the slow burn of proxy wars, resource collapse, and tactical nuclear normalization gave way to a final, global unraveling. Mini-nukes were first used in backdoor skirmishes, clean, precise, deniable, until every major power had them and no one remembered what “conventional” meant. One flash in the South China Sea in 2020 triggered a chain of strikes, escalations, and blackouts. By the time the long closed big silos opened, no one was sure who started it or why, only that the sky turned gray and never quite went back. Sealed bunkers, ghost satellites, and buried secrets are all that remain of the old world, along with the strange things those last governments tried to protect. 

Now 68 years later…



Field Journal – D.L.
Entry 4173-AE / Sector: Presidential Range / Nightfall / Wind: bad.


Sheltering in an old trail shack below Mount Eisenhower. Door’s warped but it closes. Better than nothing.

Saw another one of the Boys today, just a shape on the ridge. White mask, cloak flapping. Didn’t wave. Just watched until I passed below the tree line. No idea how long he’d been there.

Must have been full fledged, cause the newbies don’t wear those white mask. As well as that, they usually send their initiates down into the woods below the ridges. Give them three days’ worth of food. That’s it. No maps. No help. No tech. They’re supposed to kill something dangerous. Drag it back. Skin it. Wear it. Then they’re one of them.

Some come back fast, days, maybe. Most take weeks. One I met last season said she was out there seventeen days, ran out of food in four. Said she built her own traps, slept in a tree hollow. Claimed something followed her the last few nights. Said it talked, but never showed itself. She wouldn’t tell me what it said.
I didn’t press.

The woods can take a toll on someone that young, they are bad. They’re wrong. You feel it the second you step off the trail. There’s no real silence, but nothing sounds right. Owls that click. Branches that sway when there’s no wind. (Well at least in some places, you couldn’t tell here since it’s always windy.) Once, I swear I saw footprints in the snow, barefoot, human-shaped, deep, and then they just stopped. Not faded. Stopped. Mid-stride.
Later, I heard this low sound, like someone humming underwater. I left the trail after that. Didn’t sleep that night.

But the Boys? They treat it like a rite of passage. Like the woods are just part of the world, and if you die in them, then you were never meant to wear the mask. They don’t name the things down there. Don’t warn you. Don’t tell stories.

Maybe it’s shame. Maybe it’s respect.
Saw an initiate pass through a few hours before dusk. Young, maybe sixteen. Had nothing but a skinning knife and a flask. Quiet. Serious. He looked up at the mountain like it owed him something. Maybe it does.
He’ll either come back with a pelt or not at all.
Other oddities: I passed a stone pile near the Ammonoosuc River, seven stones, stacked in a perfect spiral. Saw three more just like it along the trail. Don’t think they’re natural, and they’re too clean for weather like this. I’ve seen Red Root scouts knock them over on purpose. Sometimes those scouts go missing.

Saw an old drive-thru sign near one of the outposts. Wendy’s. Someone had carved runes into it, three slashes over the face, and the phrase “mother of flame” in chalk under the melted speaker box. No one in the camp mentioned it. No one looked at it.

That’s how you know it means something.
I’m trying to reach the far slope by week’s end. Red Root patrols are getting thick, but they’re moving strange. Nervous. Like they’ve stirred something they don’t understand. They’ve taken some hills, yeah, but not the mountain. Not the summit.

The Boys aren’t giving that up. Not the guns. Not the view. Not whatever’s buried underneath all that ice and old stone.
Because whatever was important before the world ended?

It’s still here.

You’ll see the remains if you look: shattered fences, rotted tunnels sealed in inch-thick steel, and guns, old guns, built into the ridges, watching the valleys like blind gods. The Boys learned how to work some of those pieces again. The artillery is crude, but terrifying still. That’s why the Red Roots want it.

The Roots came down from somewhere in Canada like red rot on a tree. No one had heard of them until last winter, and now they’re everywhere. They march in file, fly an old American eagle banner stitched from pre-war uniforms, and quote broken slogans as if they were scripture. Not natives, despite what the paint on their faces might claim. I read that there hasn’t been a large population of them on this side of the country for awhile, so it just doesn't add up. They speak like zealots, but act like soldiers. 

They’ve tried to take the Range thrice already. Failed thrice. The Boys are too dug in, too lean, too angry. And ghosts don’t sleep.

I made it past their southern patrol by offering coffee, real beans, not that roasted chicory husk most pass as brew now. They let me through, but not without a look. They always look at you like they’re measuring your spine. Wondering if you’ll be one of theirs one day, or one of the dead in the snow.

The trader’s path hugs the edge of the Crawford cliffs now. You can see for miles if the sky’s clear, but it rarely is. Storms gather on this range like carrion birds, quick and mean. The wind never stops. They say it’s the worst weather left in the world. 

I believe it.

Still, the Boys thrive here. Somehow. Their fires never go out. Their blades never dull. It’s as if the mountain favors them.

I’ll leave by first thaw, if the road down to Ossipee holds. The Roots are moving again. You can smell their camps burning pine. If the mountain falls, it won’t fall easy, but it’ll bleed. And blood runs downhill.

—D.L.

by **Zer0n1gh7s**

**Being mistaken for an Ancient Predecessor usually resulted in** ***heavenly benefits***\*\*. Not for James Anderson.\*\*

After being thrown into an isolated training realm, he was quick to figure out that there was no tutorial. No guidance. No ancient being to fully unlock his system. For eons he remained stuck by himself. Only system notifications and rewards appearing out of thin air kept him from going insane.

But even that eventually stopped working.

**Standing at the precipice of the Isolated Realm. He closed his eyes and jumped.**

A tear in reality opened under his feet, unbeknownst to him. Dumping him into a cultivation world gone awry. Demons and evil cultivators now dominate the world. Righteous sects and clans hole up in caves and array defended mountain peaks.

Why they hide? *Well, let's just say James had something to do with it.*

Follow James Anderson, or is it Yin Hu, as he is dragged into petty squabbles and the lives of the last remaining Hu Family members; Hu Shui and Hu Jun.

Will he achieve his ultimate dream? Would there finally be his dream lady to pamper him after eons of struggling? Or maybe he should begin a harem chasing adventure?

Follow James, *Yin Hu*, as he navigates the world with the belief he isn't that strong.\]

\---

He juked left. Lunged right. James could hardly breathe, his lungs burned. He was running out of time. Out of options. Only one choice remained. He couldn’t help but curse his horrible luck. Another day, Another moment to fuck up and make a terrible decision.

James slid to a stop. Staring down at the obstacles arrayed before him. This was a task he knew his body could ill afford after exhausting his energy reserves just to make it here. But his entire existence relied on this here moment. Years of familiarity, borne of trekking this path a thousand times already, should have given him sufficient confidence.

And yet…

He slapped his face. Slapped his thighs. The person next to him made sure to give him extra space while giving odd looks.

There was no choice but to cross the Main Street during rush hour! On a green light!

James took off with the athletic ability of a regular dude. One that had not worked out or done anything sporting since highschool. Jelly legs slammed into the ground. Noodle arms pumped like pistons in a racecar. Fueled by the endless power of a similarly endless stream of coffee.

This was what peak masculinity looked like! Yes, he was going to crash soon enough, but for the being, he was a *Titan!*

None dared to match his daring pursuit. Women screamed! Men dove to grab his willy frame; jealousy! They could not stop him. His skinny body had finally come in handy as he slipped past their urgent reaching grasp and curling fingers.

Babies cried!

He would make it to work on time! No one was going to stop his holy pursuit! No demon and no mortal either! Not any of these speeding cars! Not the green light! Not the screaming and surging crowds behind him roaring as though they were in a colosseum.

Not even the old granny that caused this whole situation. Especially her.

James knew, with his very soul, that the old hag understood what she had been doing every single morning. Eyes glimmering with evil glee. Delaying him with endless idle talk and pressing him to meet any of her twelve granddaughters.

She knew he could get fired! Conspiring to force him into a relationship!

He got skinny, lunging past a whizzing car. Horns blaring, drivers screaming obscenities, swerving wildly lest they crumple before him! Another vehicle attempted to take his head, but he stopped on a dime worthy of a star NFL running back.

Barry Sanders would have been proud

James gave the road a double move. Faked right and went left. He pushed his non-existent muscles to the extreme. Beyond anything they had attempted before this day. A terrified motorbike rider was sent careening to the side. He would be alright!

The danger was real. Exhilarating. His only job demanded his presence!

…or he would get fired for being late for the millionth time. It definitely wouldn’t be because of his cursed fingers. Appliances at the grocery store he worked at seemed to go *kaput* at him barely touching them. The first few times had been excusable. No one could pinpoint him, only wondering what happened. There had been whispered and judgmental glares after the fifth time. Sneaking suspicion as the owner watched him like a hawk.

James shook his head. There was no time to think! He must let his primal instinct take over and lead him to the promised land. He could already taste his victory! The other side of the massive twelve lane Main Street called out his name. A choir of angels singing his name! His fans jumping up and down arms locked completing *the wave.*

*Shit!*

His momentary lapse of concentration had been costly. A black semi, engine pipes screaming with black smog, barreled towards him. Its raging, demonic engine and defining horn covered the entire horizon. A challenger and worthy foe!

*Not worthy enough!*

James dove. Olympians could only watch on in envy and admiration as he escaped guaranteed death…

And fell down a manhole. What the hell?! Why was there a wide open manhole in the middle of a busy street? During the rush hour?! The last thing he remembered was the retch-inducing stench and the hard concrete that met his face-first dive.

\----------

James felt a cold breeze invade his inner sanctum. Brushing against his supple skin. He shivered and reached for his blanket. Him kicking away his source of heat was a recurring issue. Forgetting his window open was another one.

It had led to many days of colds and worse; the Flu.

His fingers wrapped around a rough rag. Pulling it up to cover his head, too lazy to get out of bed and shut the window. But it left his feet exposed. That was a crime. Adjusting and readjusting did not help his situation. Worse, he figured out that his most beloved blanket—thick and long enough to wrap around him like a cocoon—was not only suddenly short.

But also not so beloved on his skin.

Its rough texture grated against his supple modern skin. Nor a single moment of hard labor meant no calluses. Surviving off instant meals led to his *generous* skinny suppleness. He wasn’t too proud of it all. But he convinced himself that women would look on in envy. So white, unmarked, and perfectly soft!

James sighed. Unable to sleep. He hoped the old granny next door hadn’t kicked his window open to sneak in again. She always looked at his soft fingers and perfect skin with an unmistakable frown of disgust and hate.

*‘Men are meant to be tough! Who’s going to protect my granddaughters if you’re so weak!’*

The thought of the madwoman had him fuming. Remembering how she snuck in dumbbells he struggled to move made him violently sit up. He surged up, jumping to his feet to rush out of his—

He froze midstep. All the energy in his body slowly escaped him. James let his leg down and stood comfortably before looking around. He let a whisper of a chuckle, butterflies running rampant in his stomach. The more he looked around the dilapidated hut around him, the worse the feeling became.

Sweat beads trickled down his back and forehead. One snuck into his eye, burning him.

He had read a long article on kidnappers yesterday. They would grab unsuspecting victims into vans, beat them up, then take them to remote hunts in the countryside. Cut them up into pieces and sell their organs for cash in the black market.

The singular common theme among them all: A broken down hut.

James rushed to grab the first items he could find as weapons. A bowl and a massive spoon. Both made out of wood. They could have fit perfectly in an ancient museum. Only God would know how a serial killer and kidnapper would get such prehistoric things.

He tiptoed towards the only source of light with ginger steps. Bright sunlight leaked from all sides of the flimsy door. Blinding him.

Every step caused a thunderstorm worthy amount of creaks and squeaks. He might as well be a herd of bison. Any serial killer behind that door would have noticed the day before yesterday. James might as well announce to the world he had finally woken up.

James Anderson resolved himself to a life and death battle. There was no way he would allow some sicko to violate his…

He shivered.

*Death before dishonor! Death before dishonor!*

He kept repeating it as his mantra. Resolving himself to *mortal combat*. He nudged the door open with the large spoon. Its long handle gave him extra space to sneak glances and hide behind the thin walls of the hut.

The door squealed like a pig being slaughtered. An alarm screaming even louder than his thunderstorm of steps.

*I am so fucking fucked.*

James was out here with nothing but a spoon and bowl. Ancient pieces of wood that would likely crumble after the first encounter. While his kidnappers and adversaries of a life and death battle probably had machetes and maybe even guns.

He let out a shuddering breath, then slowly peeked out from behind the open door. James dropped his impromptu weapons and gaped like an idiot for a few seconds.

*Shit!*

He scrambled to pick them up. The kidnapping beast was probably around here somewhere.

Then again…

Where the hell was he? He could vividly remember falling down an open manhole into a sewer. But that had been a bad nightmare, right? Right?!

James stepped over the door sill. His bare feet and toes stepped onto cool vibrant grass, morning dew still there. He surveyed his surroundings, noticing an unused campfire to his right and a stack of firewood not too far away from it. They were tied into perfect bundles and balanced vertically for some unusual reason.

He made a mental note to move them further away from the campfire if he was stuck here. They were far too close.

To his left was a large expanse of grass and a single tree just sitting in the middle of it all. Said tree towered over the entire area, its canopy casting a gargantuan shadow around it. So dense and thick not enough sunlight filtered in leaving the immediate area around it bare of anything other than roots and loose dirt.

In front of the house, about thirty paces away, was a small river. James walked up to it. The moving water so clear he could see the very bottom, covered in river stones. He could cross it with a running jump or even stride across it. The currents were slow and peaceful.

James looked left and right. The river kept going into the distance. Disappearing at the edge of what seemed like a plateau.

He could not recall any in the direct vicinity of the main city. How long was he knocked out for his kidnapper to drag him this far away from civilization? James followed the river until he reached the plateau’s edge. He peered over hoping to catch a glimpse of something he was familiar with—

*What the fuck…?*

James looked up. He let his eyes slowly fall down until he was looking straight down from the edge. It was clear skies all the way through. He could see the bottom of a flying island, roots sticking out from the side. Then it was just an endless blue sky below it.

He could see tufts of thick clouds far underneath. But that shouldn’t have been possible. Unless…

Did that mean he was past the first layer of the atmosphere?! Looking back up only made him more confused. The clear blue skies above him with similar thick white clouds floating along. Not an ounce of stars or possible outer space void. Shouldn’t he be able to see the moon or the blackness of space this far up?

James wobbled. He fell back onto his butt. The world spun around him. Vertigo. He let out a nervous laugh.

*Did I just get isekai-ed?*

It's a really big house in a more neglected part of the city. As a result, the houses and buildings need a little extra maintenance from time to time. ANYWAYS... I woke up this morning and got my day started the same way I would any other day. Had my coffee, read the news, etc... I was about to leave for work when my roommate came to me and asked if I could smell gas in the house. I was in the living room at the time and couldn't smell anything, so I followed him into our room where I was ASSAULTED by the smell of sulfur/rotten eggs. I immediately assured him that it was absolutely gas and that we needed to get in touch with the gas company or fire department, and that meanwhile we all needed to leave the house and open all the windows. That's when I was told by one of my housemates that I didn't have the authority to make that decision?! I had to get in touch with the house manager and inform them of the situation. Whatever, I sent him a text and let him know what was going on. He came down to our floor and told us that he didn't smell anything. Basically, just calling us liars. Keep in mind I would love to be wrong about this. Why would I lie? He just told me to ""let him know if it got worse"". I've always been under the impression that gas leaks were typically not a ""FAFO"" situation. Am I being dramatic? Doesn't it seem like a good idea to err on the side of caution? If not for the well-being of the people that live in the house but the neighbors in the buildings next to us? Should I just say fuck it and take matters into my own hands?

Relatively new to coffee, using a V60 style pour over that I was gifted, and then invested in a Greater Goods scale. I was also handed down a blade grinder, and I’ve been using it long enough now to realize it’s terrible and that I need to “graduate” to a burr grinder. 

I’d like to spend ~$200, which seems to be about the minimum to get a halfway decent grinder. I was intrigued by the Breville and Kitchen Aid grinders in this range, but those seem to be “overkill” as I would prefer single dose, and would stick almost exclusively to pour over. (I don’t foresee much interest/need in the future to brew espresso or other brewing methods at home.) I’ve heard good things about the Baratza Encore and Fellow Opus as well—though I was disappointed to see the Opus in store and realize it was fully plastic and appeared relatively cheap. Through more research, I think I am leaning towards the Turin SD40 or SK40, but am unsure of their performance for things other than espresso.

TL;DR
Beginner looking for ~$200 electric burr grinder for pour over. No need to be portable or switch easily between grind size. Unsure of stepped vs. stepless.

I’m the guy who believes in handwritten notes, eye contact that says more than words, and slow dancing in the kitchen just because a good song came on. I’m not here for games, ego trips, or swiping until my thumbs fall off. I’m here looking for a connection with depth, warmth, and good energy.

I’m always down to learn about culture, history, cooking, love languages… or even how to not burn toast (it’s a journey). 

I want to learn with someone. Learn new places, new flavors, new cultures, and new parts of ourselves. Let’s get lost in hidden bookstores, dive into spontaneous road trips, watch the stars until 3am, or just chill on a Sunday morning with strong coffee and stronger conversation.

Being a femboy is like wearing your heart on your sleeve—bold, beautiful, and unapologetically you. But let’s be real: life can throw curveballs that test even the sparkliest of spirits. That’s why prioritizing mental health is your VIP pass to thriving, not just surviving. Here’s how to keep your inner glow shining bright, with a dash of humor and a whole lot of optimism.

First, let’s talk life. Embracing your femboy identity is like dancing to your own playlist—sometimes you’ll trip, but the beat keeps going. Mental health is the rhythm that keeps you moving. It’s okay to have off days; even glitter needs a moment to settle. Practice self-care like it’s your favorite hobby—whether that’s journaling, meditating, or belting out show tunes in a bubble bath. Small habits, like a daily gratitude list, can rewire your brain to spot the rainbows, even on cloudy days.

Now, about those pesky bad habits and addictions—think of them as glitter bombs that seem fun but leave a mess. Breaking free starts with self-compassion. Caught yourself doom-scrolling or stress-eating glitter-dusted cupcakes? Laugh it off, then swap one habit for a healthier one. Try a five-minute walk instead of that third coffee. Progress, not perfection, is the goal. You’re not a robot; you’re a fabulous human learning to sparkle smarter.

Forging supportive relationships is like curating the ultimate squad. Surround yourself with folks who cheer your authenticity, whether they’re IRL besties or online allies in SFW spaces like this one. Share your joys, vent your struggles, but keep your privacy sacred—think of it as a velvet rope around your personal VIP zone. You don’t owe anyone your whole story, but opening up to trusted pals can lift weights you didn’t know you carried.

Here’s the truth: you’re already a masterpiece, femboy flair and all. Mental health isn’t about “fixing” you—it’s about polishing the gem you are. So, ditch the self-doubt, nurture your soul, and build connections that vibe with your magic. This community’s got your back, and every step you take is a strut toward a happier you.

It was a brisk Monday in Seattle—the kind where your salted caramel cold foam deflates mid-sip. I had just stepped off my private jet from Newport Beach, clutching my monogrammed Yeti tumbler, thinking fondly of my baristas back home. I was tired. I was vulnerable. I needed comfort.

I stepped into the Pike Street Starbucks expecting what I always expect: a seamless, standardized experience. Familiar faces—not because I know them, but because they all look the same. That’s the beauty of the apron. It equalizes. Smooths. Standardizes.

But here—here, there was chaos.

A barista stood before me in a burgundy Henley. Another wore light-wash jeans that clung to self-expression like static to polyester. A third? A lavender Coffeegear crewneck—lavender, as if to mock me.

I froze.

Where was my army of coffee-making shadows?
Where were the silent, apron-bound avatars I could trust to Sharpie my cup and never speak out of turn?

“Where… am I?” I whispered.

“Welcome in!” chirped one of them—with the smug confidence of a nose ring and a floral bandana. She looked… content. As if she wasn’t on the verge of tears from mobile orders and understaffed weekends. Suspicious.

“No,” I said, voice cracking. “That tone—those pants—that shirt. The apron is supposed to erase you, not frame you.”

She blinked. “Sorry?”

I backed out slowly, nearly crashing into a chalkboard. I collapsed onto a bench, heart pounding. A crow landed nearby. We locked eyes. I saw no judgment—only indifference. It understood me.

The apron was supposed to mean something.

It was supposed to say: This one is mine. This one will make my drink, absorb my microaggressions, and smile like a beige ghost.

But when the baristas start thinking they’re people, the whole thing collapses.

The next morning, I called a crisis meeting. “We need unity,” I declared, pacing in front of a slideshow titled Color Theory and the Death of the American Coffeehouse. “We need order.”

Solid black. Khaki. Blue denim. Approved cuts only. No whimsy. No flare.

Thus, the May 12th dress code was born.

As a Fort Worth business owner, you've probably realized that having a strong online presence isn't just nice to have—it's essential. I'm Alex Rodriguez, founder of [Lone Star Web Solutions](https://coderlift.com/), and after 12+ years of building WordPress websites for businesses across the DFW Metroplex, I've seen firsthand how the right website can transform a local business.

# Why Choose a Local Fort Worth WordPress Developer?

Y'all know that feeling when you're trying to explain what you want to someone who just doesn't get Fort Worth? That's the challenge many business owners face when working with out-of-state or overseas developers.

When you partner with a local [Fort Worth WordPress developer](https://coderlift.com/services/), you're getting someone who understands that a business in the Cultural District has different needs than one in the Stockyards or Near Southside. We know the local market because we live and breathe it every day.

The benefits go beyond just local knowledge:

* **Face-to-face meetings** that build stronger relationships and clearer communication
* **Local accountability** (we might run into you at Joe T. Garcia's, after all!)
* **Understanding of regional SEO considerations** to help you rank for local searches
* **Knowledge of what appeals to Fort Worth customers** across different neighborhoods

One of my clients, a boutique owner on Magnolia Avenue, put it best: ""Having a web developer who can meet me for coffee to discuss my site is worth its weight in gold.""

# Where to Find WordPress Developers in Fort Worth

Looking for the perfect WordPress partner? Here's where to start your search:

# Freelance Platforms

Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr let you connect with independent developers. While you'll find plenty of talent here, you'll need to vet carefully to ensure they have local Fort Worth expertise.

# Local [Web Design Agencies](https://coderlift.com/)

Fort Worth has several established agencies specializing in WordPress:

* **Supfort** \- Known for clean, modern designs
* **Cowtown Creative** \- Blends traditional Texas aesthetics with contemporary functionality
* **Lone Star Web Solutions** (that's us!) - Focused on custom WordPress solutions for small to medium businesses

# WordPress-Specific Resources

The official WordPress Jobs board sometimes features Fort Worth talent, and local WordPress meetups (we host one monthly at Craftwork Coffee on Magnolia) are great for connecting with developers face-to-face.

# Online Directories

Sites like [Clutch.co](http://Clutch.co) provide ratings and reviews of development companies. Filter by location to find Fort Worth specialists with proven track records.

# What Sets Fort Worth WordPress Developers Apart

There's something special about Fort Worth web developers. Maybe it's our blend of Texas hospitality and technological know-how, but local developers tend to approach projects with a unique perspective.

""We're not just building websites,"" as my lead developer Maria likes to say, ""we're building digital storefronts for our neighbors.""

Most Fort Worth WordPress specialists emphasize the following:

* **Relationship-based business** rather than transactional interactions
* **Longer-term partnerships** instead of one-and-done projects
* **Community-minded development** that considers how your site represents Fort Worth

# The WordPress Development Process: What to Expect

Working with a local Fort Worth developer typically follows these steps:

1. **Initial Consultation** \- Often over coffee at Avoca or at your place of business
2. **Discovery Phase** \- Learning about your business, customers, and goals
3. **Planning & Design** \- Creating wireframes and visual mockups
4. **Development** \- Building the custom WordPress site
5. **Testing & Refinement** \- Ensuring everything works perfectly
6. **Launch** \- Getting your site live
7. **Ongoing Support** \- Maintaining and updating your site

At Lone Star Web Solutions, we've refined this process over hundreds of projects. One restaurant client in the West 7th corridor told me, ""I was shocked at how painless the whole process was. Y'all made it simple from start to finish.""

# Types of WordPress Services Available in Fort Worth

As one of my clients, a law firm near downtown, noted: ""We tried the cheap route first and ended up paying twice—once for the overseas developer and then again to have a local expert fix everything.""

# Questions to Ask Your Fort Worth WordPress Developer

Before hiring anyone, make sure to ask:

It was wordy before perhaps this is some issue internally. I'm chatting and no word trully feels akin to some greater message strewn in the chat. Haven't quite had coffee either in a while. Can you feel that there is no string tying my messages together? I need to focus and I just noticed this. Yet I can focus and I have been productive today... this is the longest I have gone without coffee in a while (three-ish weeks technically).

I have so much to do that I haven't started but time seems to be flowing slower and for that I am thankful. My mind is in no rush and I type slowly yet... previously I typed rushedly cause my mine was constantly rushed and active. Then I calmed at last and everything fit just fine and now its blurred apart... some sort of extreme calm if you can call it that. I'm empty but not void of anything. Just air... and I fly up into the sky nebulously.

What the effing?

So I just feel at peace but should I? No drugs or anything, sober of all distraction listening to calm slow music to keep my mind at rest. Not too worried about the fact that I am behind. I attempted to chat online, noticed how I felt. Yet coffee jerked my mind around into pure panic.

All feels disjointed yet Irise into the sky floating through the clouds, thats how I feel. Wheres the stress I should but, rather, cannot feel? Whats the point? I haven't journaled in a couple days and possibly this fits it best.

I noticed earlier I was forgetting what I was going to say... like a lapse in time. Which why am I not worried? Why? Nontheless it can be fixed and possibly will through time. Or help.",2,1744684849.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

1jzgrt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayChristians/comments/1jzgrt6/alone_forever/,Alone forever(?),"Hey, I'm a 19 year old Christian bisexual trans man. I've known for a long time about my gender and sexuality, but it took me a while to come to terms with it in my faith and my walk with Jesus. 

I don't have any shame for who I am, in fact most of the time when I'm most accepting of myself is when I'm closest to Jesus. 

However, I recently entered my first ever relationship (took me a while I know). It lasted 6 months and I loved every minute of it. They were smart, charming, Christian, they respected my boundaries, and made me feel so comfortable with myself to the point where I'd still feel just as masculine without my binder. It was amazing.

But I found out they were cheating on me the whole time we were together.

(If you want to read the crazy story behind that [it's worth it i promise], if not, you can skip ahead to the next paragraph):

My whole family is very conservative and very against queer people (my grandpa said they should make it legal to shoot queer people and that would ""fix"" this generation). The only person who knew about my relationship was my Aunt who found it out by accidentally coming across my preferred name written somewhere. Im scared to tell my family in general because I don't think I would be safe, but my Aunt is slightly better because all she'll do is yell + argue with me, but then pretend nothing happened and im still straight and cis. Anyways, about a month after she found out I was in a relationship, she invited me over to a house where she was house sitting. I was excited and my Uncle showed up too so it was chill. After playing games, my Aunt switched off the tv and turned to me. All she knew about my partner at the time was their name (possibly only their first name). She pulled up a photo of them and showed it to me. ""Is this [partner's name]?"" ""Yes..."" I answered, already not feeling good about the situation. She then proceeded to show me multiple photos of them and this other trans guy (i mention trans because it is one of the MANY similarities we both had). This other guy was a similar height, similar face, similar style, similar humor (based off the posts), and even similar names. I was angry, not only because I found out I was getting cheated on for 6 months, but also because my Aunt and Uncle had to SEARCH to find this because I couldn't even find it after hours of looking for it until I got the exact user name. (Im not big on social media). I was crying, and confused, and embarrassed. My Aunt then turned to my Uncle, ""I brought him and told him everything because I thought he would have some good input on the situation."" My Uncle then awkwardly piped up, ""Yeah, I mean even as a driver's ed instructor, I see kids go through heartbreak all the time... There was even this one girl whose boyfriend cheated on her and physically abused her and they were together for years and she was 15 with 3 other abusive boyfriends. She also didn't know how to spell. Like she spelled space like ""S-P-A-Y-C"", really shows you how downhill our education system has gone-"" They then both went on talking about the education system for a good 10 minutes while im having a full-on mental breakdown. Whatever, I take a shower and do some stalking. After my uncle leaves, my Aunt tries to empathize with me by telling about her ex-boyfriend who had sex with another women on my Aunt's own bed and how she was just going to leave and let it happen. She then brushed it off and pretended like nothing ever happened. We went to bed and I slept in the LIVING ROOM on the COUCH with a blanket that smelled like DOG, sobbing about everything and how dumb I must be to trust someone who would lie to me throughout our whole relationship. My Aunt scrolled on her phone. At some point in the night, a very cold night (15°), my Aunt opened this sliding door, so I was freezing for half the night with no reason why. The next morning, we went to get coffee before church. I was disassociating and my Aunt was trying to get me to focus so I could order. After that, I got in my car, and she in hers, and I cried on the whole drive to the church (like 30-45 min). NOW, this church is the closest thing to a CULT I've ever experienced. I get there and it's small, but there's only like 15 people in the whole church (less than 1/3 of the pews). Obviously, everyone is going to notice the new guy. This church says the pledge of allegiance before ANYTHING ELSE and then pledge to Christian flag and Bible. Im already like wtf am i doing here and im silently sobbing through the whole thing). The pastor then points me out and everyone stares at me, ""I see we have a visitor today! Aunt, who is this?"" ""This is my niece, [deadname]!"" The pastor then smiles and grabs a box. My aunt turns to me and says, ""He won't leave unless you take something!"" The piano starts playing and they all start singing this song, I don't remember how it goes, but it's something like: ""Welcome guest! We are blessed to have you, welcome, welcome, welcome, we're so glad God brought you."" Mind you, this church ONLY sings hymns, so this was WACKY. The pastor then DANCES up to me (i wish I was making this up) and holds the box out to me. I grab something random and look at it. Now, out of all the things you would guess this object would be, I bet you'd get every single one wrong. Because i pulled out a 3D ufo eraser with a little alien in it and a glass dome over its head. Okay, whatever, weird, but im too busy LITERALLY CRYING WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING to notice how insane that was. We move on to the sermon and the pastor starts off well saying how we shouldn't let all of our purpose and control be in/on other people, but rather give control to God. Good. Great. Then he switches to substances, saying how we shouldn't give control to them or rely on them for our happiness. Okay, yeah, sure. Then he switches to we shouldn't be putting all our happiness in non-christian artists because all they sing about is SAD and ANGRY things and the purpose of music is to glorify God, so HOW DARE ALL OF YOU (pointing to everyone in the pews) LISTEN TO SUCH SINFUL CRAP, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT!!! And nobody batted an eye. This actually made me feel better because of how dumb it was. Like if you don't want to listen to non-christian music, then don't. But this pastor was acting like it was a sin to even sing about something that's not God. When really, the act of creating music can be God-glorifying. Like that one verse ""Let all that you do be glorifying to God"". Sure, there could be some songs out there that you feel convicted about and decide to not listen to anymore, but im not gonna go around screaming about how someone is sunful cause they enjoy a Taylor Swift song every once and a while. Like what????? Anyways, fast-forward (my aunt never said another word about the whole incident), I'm calling my partner. We go on a break and eventually break up. Turns out, they had been dating other guy before we started dating. And their relationship was an ""open-relationship"". I tried to ask why they did it and they didn't really have an answer besides degrading themselves and praising me over and over and kind of pushing me to just break up with them because they were too ""pussy"" (their words) to break up with one of us. We never had sex, (im waiting til marriage for personal reasons), but them and this random dude were banging throughout our relationship although, apparently, ""they were trying to slowly break it off with the other person because they were scared that he would react like a psychopath if they broke up with him"". 

Anyways, I was stupidly looking for a rebound while trying to convince myself I wasn't. And I installed 3 dating apps and was looking around me. I couldn't find anyone who was queer, Christian, sober, and had mutual attraction. I kid you not, within 100 miles, I could not find anyone. Even in my last relationship, they were one of the last available profiles and we just happened to hit it off.

This took a big hit to my mental being because it's been over a month and I'm so alone and really losing hope that there is someone who meets all these standards. I was even considering gor a while, going back to my ex because ""I won't be able to do better"". 

I guess all I'm asking is if anyone has any advice on finding someone who is passionate in their faith and also queer? People in loving, queer, Christian relationships, how did you find your partner?

1jzgqvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1jzgqvs/i_heard_screams_from_the_vault/,I Heard Screams From The Vault,"Hey y'all wrote this after a failed attempt at a bank robber scene, it then evolved into a creepy pasta due to me binging Creepcast. Would love some feedback

 ""Listen up people!"" The man's rubber mask bounced along with each syllable, 
"" I don't want to see anyone try to be on the news, I'd hate to read your family's obituaries describing your lives!"" He paused his deep brown eyes scanning over the calm innocent sea of people. His gaze washed over the ripples from his words thrown like stones. 
"" I am not an insane man! I am merely desperate. I can assure all of you have been in my shoes. You'll all be fine, I want you all to be fine. Fine with me and what I must do."" His gun swung around in his crazed grip as he spoke. I sat there  in my teller booth. Hands up lazily, you know barely up to my shoulders. I could care less anymore, I haven't been sleeping well, I can hardly keep my eyes open at this point. I can feel my jaw opening despite my desire not to. A jawn crawls it way out my throat and I let this so-called robber notice me. 
"" Fuck."" I whisper to myself.

""Hey! Excuse me! Am I just not getting through to you!"" He swung the piece of shit uzi thing at the ceiling and let off a few rounds. 
""Are we feeling more alert now?"" He screamed towards me. Despite how distant he was I could smell the coffee and cigarette smoke that stained his teeth and stupid mustache. Barely even fucking hidden by the mask. But besides the shock of my burning nose hairs, the pop of gunpowder kinda woke me up, at least a small bust of adrenaline. And yet my body decided to betray me and I felt it again. Those brown eyes widen hilariously as I jawn again. I would apologize but he won't accept that. His gun swung towards my face, then towards  the teller next to me.
""Okay then maybe this will help ya out."" He smugly said and pulled the trigger. A sharp ringing let out and a burst of red mist shot out my coworkers chest. Steven. My only friend in this hell hole.

When he dropped down, he clashed around dramatically. His station turned upside down from his fall. The spraying of red everywhere and all over the robber. Our manager Ricky ripped off the mask furious. 
""God damn it you two!"" His face is red with anger. 
""You fucked with the squibs again!"" 
I at this point was practically falling over laughing. 
"" Shut the fuck up you two! These robbery drills are serious!"" He continued on after his statement towards the two of us. But we have these once a month and after five years of working here we have not been robbed once. 
Starting my day off like this was sadly way too normal.

"" Here at Babylon Banking we take care of your money, Or you can have it back!""  The dumbest slogan for anything, let alone a bank. And to be honest why the hell do we have a slogan. I asked myself that when I applied for the janitor position. Having been outta highschool for a few years and not wanting to do anything involving college. My parents kicked me out and Steven let me move in. He was already working there as a janitor himself and recommended me. Getting hired was easy enough, even without it, the interviewer was this stout man who asked basic questions. Why do I want to work here, what are my strengths and weaknesses. Typical stuff, until he kinda just switched up the questions. Have you even been declared legally insane? No. Are you religious at all? No. Are you afraid of the dark? No.  All the sudden out of the box questions weirded me out, I get freaked out a little easier than most people. But I'm also like most people and my fears faded away after I heard the pay they would offer me.

I answered all but one truthfully. 

And from there I was a janitor and then bumped up to the mail room and so on till where I am now. Covered in fake blood laughing at the man who first hired me. 
"" You fucking two are something else!"" Ricky said as he tossed paper towels around us to clean. He began to walk off but stopped his hate filled steps.
"" Actually, Jason."" His words had a hint of malicious intent, so great now Stevens little joke is gonna get my ass chewed out. He fully turned around his fake gun pointing towards me still. Even though it wasn't real and only shot blanks it still unease me. And he knew that.
"" Go ahead and get changed. Steven can finish this up, I have a task for you. Meet me in my office when you're ready"" 

And like a good little worker I listened, honestly a little happy. Steven gave a weak wave as I hurried along. Those squibs are very powerful if not properly set up, like for a joke perhaps. I saw him rubbing his chest. I turned a corner towards the locker room where I kept my backpack and monthly new suit. I saw the maze of cubicles full  of the older workers and HRs door slightly open. Ms.Rose our hr lady had one of our oldest workers there some 60 something year old. I could slightly see his watery eyes and her hand pass over an envelope.  That was another thing about this place, you know besides the constant fake robbers. I've never seen anyone be fired for any real reason, not for being late constantly, being a no call no show, practical jokes . We work in a contract style, at least to my understanding, each time mines about to run out I get promoted that's all I really understand. But the only way I've seen anyone leave here is when they, as corporate puts it, age out. Its weird working here. But I ignored the sad old man and made my way to the lockers. Changed my bloody clothes and walked my ass to his office. 

I approached his door praying that he wasn't there yet so I could have a small break waiting on him. But alas God sometimes doesn't want me to be satisfied, as for before I could even knock, Ricky was opening the door.
""Come on in Jacob."" He said calmly but the red stains on his face and shirt say other wise. I know he's pissed and I'm honestly wondering if I'll be the first under fifty person to be fired from Babylon Banking. 
""Take a seat Jacob, but don't get comfy."" Fuck I must be getting fired. I thought that to myself as  I hazardly sat down in the black office chair. 
"" Jacob we here a Babylon Banking, well we do things differently than your average bank, now wouldn't you agree?"" I shook my head in agreeance. My eyes wandering over to the rubber mask of his own face he wore earlier. The fake blood covering it. He spoke again and regained my attention.
"" Yes yes, well buddy because of that stunt you and Steven pulled I'm gonna have to let you go-"" 
""Now wait a second it was his idea.""  His hand halted my interruption.
"" Don't be rash, I'm gonna have to let you go down to the vaults to do Stevens job. You're being promoted to his position."" 
"" But why?"" I knew it was dumb to question a promotion but I didn't want Steven to be outta a job.
"" Don't worry Stevens been here for a while now and now he gets to be with people more, how should I put it, experienced just like him. So forget the shit you knew about bank teller stuff. Now you work the vaults."" The vaults he's referring to are our two banking vaults, obviously, and it was Stevens job for the past year or so to take down these giant containers down there to I guess unload them. He never elaborated about what he did , only something about precious information. 
"" So go ahead and take a small break, I'll give ya ten minutes, then meet Steven by the elevators."" 

Twenty minutes later and I'm standing by the elevators, waiting for ten. Steven is nowhere to be seen, and now I've had some workers I've never met  bring me two little carts with bags of money on them. Another ten minutes pass and with the two carts I just decided to take initiative and do it myself how hard can it be. So I click the basement button and make my way down.
The smell of metal surrounds me as it  slowly makes it way down. I swear I can taste the metal the air. Five minutes passed and I was still not at the basement. Another five passed, I even considered that I wasn't moving but when I hopped up I could feel that yes I was still traveling down.
"" What the fuck is taking so long-"" and as if it was listening to me, the elevator opened it doors. Opened them to a dark hallway, a single light every couple of feet barely illuminated the deep red carpet.  And at the end of the hall I could make out a painting hanging there. Ignoring my body's suggestion of just leaving I pushed and pulled the carts. Fighting the carpets attempts to hold my cart's wheels, I slowly made my way down the hall. The carts gave no help and it was a constant struggle to get them to move. It was like trying to take them through mud. But I made my way down stopping at the sign that pointed me to a hall that just seemingly appeared suddenly. This was the way to the vaults, yeah but there was more hallway and I still couldn't make out the painting that kept itself in my mind. I could only make out a single figure painted onto the canvas. Some kind of portrait. I stared down trying hard to see it, but to no avail. The remaining hall was tempting to explore, it all was so outta place I would never have expected this here it seemed so I don't know off putting I guess. But I had to continue moving as much as I goof around here, leaving money left alone seems bigger and definitely a fire able offense. Luckily the hall to the vaults weren't carpeted and were cheap flooring covered in stains from the countless times carts ran over them. Leading me right to the vaults. There sat a guard at some station who seemed shocked when I approached the desk. 
"" Aye bub where's the Steven guy?"" The guard asked me, standing up quickly I could feel the tension forming as he asked me. Watching his hand reach for his hip, I answered
"" Oh Ricky said for me to do this, I'm the new guy I guess you could say."" I was honestly a little freaked out. 
"" Ah I see y'all's twos got promoted."" He tipped his baseball cap at me,
"" Well the names Allen, as you can see I guard this here area. Keeping crooks and creeps out of the vaults."" He laughed.

""Well I'm neither, just tryna do my job. I gotta say I ain't gonna get used to that long ass elevator ride."" I laughed a bit till I noticed his perplexed look.
""What is that ten minute ride not that bad any more to ya?"" His look didn't change even after I said that.
"" It's a thirty second ride at most bub, what the hell are you talking about?""  He questioned me,
"" What? Hell no man and then there was that long ass hallway with the red carpet."" He pointed to the elevator across the room from us. 
""That's the elevator you came down right?"" 
Standing there like an idiot, I just gazed at the doors. They seemed to mock me, the shiny gloss showing me a twisted reflection that laughed at my confusion. 
""Uh I think.""
"" And you saw a hall with red carpet?""  Allen asked me his tone one of authority like my body knew it shouldn't, no couldn't lie to him.
"" Yes sir, I came out and struggled to pull the carts through."" I answered. He smiled.
"" Then followed a sign to here."" I continued.
He looked at me then I saw his eyes dart behind me. I turned and followed, nothing just the hall entrance I came through and the elevator. As I was looking he yanked the cart out of my grip making me jump. Moving it into the first vault, he then he began to shut it the hinges screaming out like banshees. My ears hurt as he slowly shut the door. He  kept his eyes on me,  made his way past me and grabbed the second cart. And walked over to the second vault opposite of the first. He then turned to me and said with a smile.
"" Congrats on the promotion, and tell Steven I said good luck. He'll need it. Those cubicles will suck the life outta ya."" He smiled again and then sternly told me, 
""Leave the way you came.""  Then he went into the second vault. 

Thoroughly weirded out I turned towards the elevator, and began a journey back up top. My finger was about to press the button, but the thought of what Allen said hit me. Leave the way you came. I looked over at the opening I wheeled through, he couldn't have met that right? 
Well I walked over to it, turned the corner and felt my stomach drop. There was no hall. Only a set of stairs. Freaked out I turned around yelling,
""Hey Allen!"" But behind me was the red carpeted hallway. And a few feet from me was the portrait, a portrait of a lone man sitting in a chair. But his eyes were sulken in deeply almost empty pits. His cheeks just the same. He wore a suit colored navy blue, his hands where almost skeletal but what caught me was the right hand. It was pointing by the looks of it. I followed the fingers direction to another opening next the painting. I went to walk towards it, the carpet becoming harder and harder to walk through. As I approached I could feel each beat of my heart, what was happening to me was I insane. Was I blacking out or something how did I get here again, why the fuck am I here, and just where the fuck am I? Rounding the corner I saw it. A third vault. Rusty as hell and old as hell as well. It sat there outta place compared to the others. Ancient to them, to me. Then I heard the screams. They came from the vault but the doors were not opening. It sounds human it sounded pained. Then what I heard next sent me running down the hall, running towards the elevator door miles down the hall. 
""NOT YET!"" It echoed again behind me. The source unknown but just as unpleasant. 

I kept running and running trying to reach the elevator doors. But each step felt as if I was running in wet sand. Like the carpet itself was grabbing my shoes to slow me down. But I prevailed never stopping never letting the carpet take me and as soon as I pressed the button the doors swung open and I collapsed in the elevator. Breathing deeply and quickly I pressed the ground floor button and a few seconds later it opened up and I was back up top. 
And standing there was Ricky and Steven waiting for me. 
""How was it?"" Steven asked. 
""What the fuck do you mean how was it?"" I responded 
""Well you went down there by yourself, I'd imagine Allen gave you a hard time."" Steven stated. Theres no way he doesn't know about this right? About the creepy ass hallway or Allen's strange way of congrats. 
"" Oh yeah he did but he also said Good luck to you.""  He turned to Ricky, 
"" I guess news travels fast, yup buddy I got promoted. Leisure work life is what I'm doing now."" He said happily. But his happy demeanor was offset by the look Ricky was giving me. His eyes were screaming at me but his mouth didn't move. He put a hand on Steven and told us,
"" Alright it's been a day of ups and downs for you two. Why not go home and rest, y'all's gotta get trained tomorrow."" Ricky said his eyes never leaving mine.
I got up and went with Steven to our lockers passing by the cubicles again,  noticing the janitors emptying out one of them, just tossing everything into their containers. And the name Neil Goodman was all over the papers as we walked past. The name seemed familiar, but I couldn't recall from where. I'll ask Steven when we get home, I'm not excited for tomorrow.

# Ingredients:

* 1–2 drops vanilla extract
* Ice cubes
* Ground nutmeg (for garnish)

# Instructions:

1. Fill your highball glass with ice cubes.
2. Add Maker’s Mark 46, Foursquare Spiced Rum, Kahlúa Especial, and cola directly into the glass.
3. Stir gently to combine the base ingredients.
4. Add 2 dashes of Angostura bitters and 1–2 drops of vanilla extract, stirring lightly to blend.
5. Slowly pour the splash of half-and-half over the back of a spoon to float it on top, creating a layered effect.
6. Garnish with a sprinkle of ground nutmeg for an elegant finish.",1,1744683406.0,mixeddrinks,1,1.0,False

1jzgmkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SomaticExperiencing/comments/1jzgmkb/ive_been_crying_so_much_the_last_3_days_more_than/,"I’ve been crying so much the last 3 days. More than I’ve cried in years. I’ve been able to feel super anxious where I feel like I’m going to panic, and I’ve been crying (both good and bad feelings)","I'm not sure if it's because I reduced my Zoloft - it's actually likely, but I've even able to cry again, a lot. I got some good news today and ugly cried for like an hour. But also sad cried all weekend. I've even using music to help me feel.

I was blocked from feeling anything at all until I reduced my Zoloft from 50mg to 25mg. But my anxiety is also back. I can't drink coffee because it makes my nervous system go crazy. But on 50mg I could.

I think I need to be able to feel all this. But it's also a lot. I'm not afraid to panic because my mind is learning none of this is dangerous. With the medication, it was just numbing it all out and making me fear the feelings. So is this a good thing? 
 
My body feels very heavy and I feel extremely overstimulated. I feel like there's no happy medium. I'm either completely numb on Zoloft or feeling a bit overwhelmed. While im able to cry and feel deep sadness or even pride- there's no other positive emotions. I just always feel either anxiety, sadness or numbness. I'd also say that my DPDR is really bad right now too, and I live in 24/7 DPDR already.

Where is the bottom of the negative emotions? I feel like I'm an open wound that just doesn't stop bleeding. I either put pressure on it (numbness) or I let it bleed out (crying) but that wound never heal. The dissociation never stops. It's all just too much, or too little. When do I get windows of feeling good? I am so tired. So so tired after 3 years of this. Yet I somehow keep achieving things in my career - and I cry, cause the little boy inside me  is proud of me, yet he's still hurting.
