I think it would be awesome if we could group them into one hotkey and apply them all at once. Would be a huge QoL improvement for us.

I would also love to see Perk cards further increase either the duration or effects of food buffs. They could change existing food related perks to increase how long the food buff lasts or how effective it is. Or both. Im not talking about using it to make canned coffee way more OP than it already is. Im talking about making the above buffs last 2-3 hours each instead and keep your feeling fed for that long also. Think it would be huge.

1i6m0yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1i6m0yj/hitchhiking_today/,Hitchhiking today ,"Backtracked to the closest mcDs. Closed.

Got coffee, warmed up and did a quick wash of the hair with soap in the dispenser.  Quick dry with hoodie. Wiped sink down (leave no trace).

Started walking South by I-35. Slipped once and just laughed. Almost slipped again.

Decided to find a place to hitchhike.

Right by the Fairfield Inn South of the Travel Center seemed like a good spot.

Not long after I still can't force a legitimate, genuine smile. It feels forced and fake.

""Wooh. You can't be the man until you beat the man.""

It's genuine. Laughter. Smiling.

Two hands all the way in the air - thumbs up both hands - like I'm the heavyweight champ thanking the fans.

(I'm trying to relieve anxiety and trick my limbic system.)

Coincidence or not I don't know.

Tammy picks me up.

""I'm only going two exits.""


I take it. The heat is on. We're moving in the right direction.

Tried again when I started feeling tired.

No luck.

Found a storm drain (big rectangular thing) sat inside to get out of the wind.

Once I got cold again I started walking.

McDonald's at the pilot is closed also.

I need something cheap to get out of the cold and away from the slop. Ice is turning to water. My shoes are wet. Socks. Cold feet.

Check the Pilot app. Two share size Snickers for the price of one. It ain't two for 25, but it'll do.

I'm going to see if the sun will come out. If it does, I'm going to see if I can post up on the side of the interstate. Seen several local cops and deputy this AM.

Maybe there is a place at the Pilot I can post up for a ride.

I'm going to be hungry and cold. Can't stop that either way. Two Snickers helped greatly.

If I can't catch a ride by the time the temp starts going down again, I will start walking.

I'll see how long I can hang out here inside. They say McDonald's in the truck stop may open later. If it does, I'll ride that as long as I can for 99 cents.

Even if I'm stuck here until later, that's okay. It shouldn't drop below 20. It's snow and not raining.

That's golden for my situation.

1i6m071,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/1i6m071/magnifica_s_too_short_brew_duration/,Magnifica S too short brew duration,"I have the aroma wheel on maximum, or close to it.

The grinder is on 1, the lowest setting.

The ratios I tried are 1:3 and 1:4 (\~10-13g coffee, 30-40ml of finished coffee).

The machine does NOT have flow interuptions at this setting, and the ground coffee, when inspected, IS fine, and there are no dry sports in used pucks. So, it seems the water does go through it as well as it can be expected.

But..

Most online sources/stories say that these machines by all accounts should not work very well with lowest grinder settings, that most often the fow will be interupted. Most advise to go to 3 or so.



But in my case, with lowest grind setting of 1, and ratio 1:3 or 1:4, the coffee is still pretty weak, and the brew (from the moment the actual brew starts, not counting the initial stage) only takes 7-8 seconds. It's actually faster compared to when the grinder is at 3, which is \~10-13sec..

  
Can the case be the coffee? Sadly I am using supermarket coffee. There is no packaging date on it, just best before. So, it can't be really fresh. I did try a more known commercial brand, Lavazza, but it is similar.

I have not yet tried any specialty dark roast coffee.

New birthday, even changed my name to an abbreviated version of my full name. Never signed into my home WiFi, only used mobile data. Everything was fine until I woke up a to a ban this morning. Worst part about it was I was doing great on the app, had gotten 10 matches in only a couple of days. I never gave my real number to matches.
I'm honestly giving up, only thing I didn't do was remove meta data from the photos, but I figured that wouldn't be necessary since most of them weren't taken on my phone, but by friends/ex.

1i6lwxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i6lwxh/turning_big_dreams_into_reality/,Turning big dreams into reality,"Hey fellow entrepreneurs,

I’m stuck on something that’s been holding me back for a while. I’m a dreamer—the kind of person who’s always coming up with big ideas and ambitious goals.- This is how my sister describes me.  I’ve got so many things I want to do and business ideas I’m excited and passionate about. Everything from community food forests, building sustainable and affordable housing, adventure vacation stays, oh so many more lol. 

Here’s the thing: I have ADD, so staying focused and actually turning those dreams into plans is even harder for me. My brain is constantly buzzing with new possibilities, and it’s overwhelming how to break them down into steps I can handle. I’ll get fired up about an idea, dive in, and then… nothing. Shiny object syndrome kicks in, I overthink everything, or I just can’t figure out what to do next.

I started a real estate investing LLC (to use as a vehicle for the housing, and real estate ventures) I opened a  greenhouse business (which I actually dissolved in December), silver lining is we built the greenhouse so it's definitely a nice addition to our property-   Right now, my focus is on opening my coffee shop, but it’s been a tough road. For two years, I poured everything into creating a plan, applying for grants, and sourcing equipment. I even got a grant for an espresso machine and signed a lease—paying three months upfront plus a deposit. I was just two months away from opening when everything went sideways. The building had issue after issue: flooding, electrical problems, and no support from the landlord. On top of that, my family experienced a huge loss during this time. It all felt like too much, and my momentum ground to a halt. Since I wasn't able to open, my espresso machine was taken back, and since I put all my money into the rents/deposit, I've depleted all the savings. I do still have all my other equipment & furniture packed in my garage currently.

We live in a small community, I really want to open my shop here, I want it to be a community place for my kids and their friends, locals, I want it to be inviting, with different areas of the shop to offer different experiences. Everything from the furniture to equipment, I sourced from thrift stores, sales, etc. Also want to be surrounded books, lots and lots of books, the older the better lol - ok only ONE area will be for that (me). lol Anyway continuing on...

Another thing I struggle with MAJORLY is letting go and delegating. I always want to do everything myself to save money, especially since I’m juggling this alongside raising three teens. But it’s exhausting trying to do it all, not to mention the amount of time I waste trying to figure out how to do things I have no interest in actually doing, or have no business doing is ridiculous. I know I need to figure out how to let go and ask for help, -  I won't say I'm anti-social because I'm not, however I do struggle getting out, meeting people, reaching out, not only because its time consuming but I also prefer to be behind the scenes, not the face. I keep my circle small, I'm a private person, and I don't have social media (i have a Facebook but not I'm active).

So, I’m wondering if anyone else here has or are currently going through this and found ways to balance dreaming big with actually getting stuff done.

How do you:

1. Create a plan that doesn’t feel like climbing a mountain?
2. Figure out when to delegate and how to trust others with tasks?
3. Stay organized when you’re juggling multiple responsibilities and ideas?
4. Keep pushing forward when setbacks and life’s curveballs knock you off track?

If you actually made it through that mess, you're awesome! lol

Val’s choreography maintains the lively bounce and synchronized hops that define the Quickstep, while adding new intricate sequences that challenge Selena’s precision and timing. Selena’s frame is much more controlled tonight, her shoulders staying down even during the faster sections. Her foot placement is crisp, and her transitions between movements are smoother and more fluid than in the original performance. The playful elements of the routine, like the coffee cup prop and cheeky gestures, are executed with ease, allowing Selena’s personality to shine through. A standout moment comes as Selena and Val execute a series of intricate pivots with flawless synchronization, earning cheers from the audience.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""Selena, this was a true redemption! Your frame was so much stronger, and your footwork has improved leaps and bounds. You’ve always had the charm, but tonight you brought the technique too. Your shoulders were way better, but they were still up a little teeny tiny bit at times but that's the only thing. Other than that it was amazing!""

**Derek Hough:**  
""Selena, this Quickstep was light, bubbly, and so much fun to watch! Your posture was so much better, and those pivots were absolutely fantastic. You’ve shown so much growth since Week 6, and it’s clear you’ve worked hard on every detail. Carrie Ann is right about the shoulders but I don't wanna harp on it because this was still great.""

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
""Darling Selena, you just proved that persistence pays off! The energy, the sparkle, the precision—it was all there. Your frame was a major improvement, and you never lost that beautiful effervescence that makes you so captivating. Wonderful job!""

Here is the leaderboard at the end of R1!

1. Sabrina and Brandon/Bruno and Daniella (30)
2. N/A
3. Addison and Pasha (29)
4. Selena and Val (27)

Next up is a brand new round of competition, the Dynamic Duo round! Our finalists will be split into two different groups and they will perform together for scores that will be based off their performance as a group. The two couples will dance simultaneously to start the dance, before breaking into a solo for each couple, which will lead into both CELEBRITIES dancing together without their pros for 20 seconds, before concluding the dance together as a group. The way our groups will be divided was decided at the end of the show last week, so let's play the clip where that was decided. 

(Flashback)

Ok, so there are 2 options you have. Either you can pick the song and style you will be performing to, or you can pick the couple you will be performing with. Sabrina and Brandon, as the highest cumulative scoring couple of the season, you get to pick which option you want to take. 

Sabrina and Brandon decide they want to choose their partner and select.... Bruno and Daniella

Which means that Addison and Pasha and Selena and Val will be partnered together. Addison and Pasha, it is up to you to pick either a Rumba to One Moment in Time by Whitney Houston or a Foxtrot to Again by Janey Jackson.

They select a Foxtrot to Again by Janet Jackson. Which means that Sabrina and Brandon and Bruno and Daniella will dance a Rumba to One Moment in Time! 

Ok, lets kick off this round with Duo #1, Sabrina and Brandon as well as Bruno and Daniella!

**Duo #1: Sabrina and Brandon/Bruno and Daniella Rumba**

**Song: ""One Moment in Time"" by Whitney Houston**

Sabrina, Brandon, Bruno, and Daniella take the floor for an emotionally charged Rumba that radiates elegance, precision, and heartfelt storytelling. The routine begins with the four dancers moving in perfect unison, their lines and fluid movements reflecting the tender, aspirational tone of the song. Their synchronization is breathtaking, with every sway and turn perfectly in time with Whitney Houston's soaring vocals.

Sabrina and Brandon open the solo section, showcasing Sabrina’s unparalleled control and sensuality. Her arm extensions are breathtaking, and the fluidity in her hip action complements Brandon’s strong yet tender leading. They conclude with a stunning spiral turn that leaves the audience captivated.

Bruno and Daniella follow with a solo equally as mesmerizing, Bruno exuding confidence and musicality. His movements are smooth, and his connection with Daniella is palpable as they execute a series of intricate spins and fluid transitions. A standout moment comes when Bruno performs a seamless dip with Daniella, earning audible gasps from the audience.

The highlight of the performance is the celebrity duet between Sabrina and Bruno. Dancing without their pros, they exude grace and unity, their chemistry creating an emotional connection that resonates deeply with the audience. Their movements complement each other beautifully, balancing power and vulnerability, truly looking like two pros.

The routine concludes with all four dancers reunited, performing a synchronized series of sweeping motions and dramatic poses that bring the Rumba’s narrative of hope and determination to a powerful close.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""That was absolutely stunning. Sabrina and Bruno, your connection in the duet section was magical—you danced as though you’ve been partners all season. The synchronization throughout was incredible, and both couples delivered such heartfelt performances. A beautiful Rumba!""

**Derek Hough:**  
""This was the definition of elegance and storytelling. Sabrina and Bruno, your duet was a masterclass in connection and musicality. Both couples shone in their solos, and the group sections were seamless. This routine felt like a celebration of everything you’ve learned this season. Brilliant!""

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
""Darling, that was a Whitney Houston masterpiece brought to life! Sabrina, your precision and grace were out of this world. Bruno, your musicality and connection were breathtaking. The duet was pure poetry, and as a group, you created a moment we’ll never forget. Bravo!""

**Scores: 10, 10, 10 (30/30)**

Incredible! Next up is Duo #2 with a Foxtrot, it's Addison and Pasha and Selena and Val!

**Duo #2: Addison and Pasha/Selena and Val Foxtrot**

**Song: ""Again"" by Janet Jackson**

Addison, Pasha, Selena, and Val take the floor for a Foxtrot that exudes romance, elegance, and cinematic flair. The routine begins with all four dancers moving in perfect harmony, gliding across the ballroom with seamless transitions and graceful lines. Their opening sequence features smooth traveling steps and a grand promenade that perfectly captures the sultry sophistication of Janet Jackson’s *Again*.

Addison and Pasha are the first to perform their solo. Addison’s natural charm shines through, and her movements are fluid and controlled. Her footwork has improved since the earlier rounds, but there’s a slight moment where her timing with Pasha falters during a series of intricate turns. Despite this, her connection with Pasha remains strong, and they finish their section with a dazzling dip that earns applause.

Selena and Val take over with their solo, radiating poise and confidence. Selena’s frame is polished, and her movements feel effortlessly elegant. A standout moment comes when Val leads Selena through a stunning oversway, her lines extending beautifully. However, there’s a slight hesitation in one of her transitions, which briefly interrupts the otherwise flawless flow of their performance.

The celebrity duet section sees Addison and Selena dancing without their pros. While both bring a sense of partnership and charm, the duet lacks the sharp connection and synchronicity needed to elevate it to the next level. Their timing feels slightly off during a side-by-side chasse sequence, and while they recover quickly, the chemistry doesn’t fully capture the magic of the previous duet.

The routine concludes with all four dancers reuniting for a sweeping final sequence, where the synchronized movements and dramatic finishes bring the performance to a strong and elegant close.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""Addison and Selena, you both brought such elegance to this routine! Your solos were beautiful, and I loved seeing how far you’ve come. The duet section was charming, but it didn’t have the same seamless quality as the rest of the performance. Still, this was a gorgeous Foxtrot!""

**Derek Hough:**  
""Addison and Selena, I loved the romantic tone you brought to this dance. Your solos showcased your individual strengths beautifully. The duet had some timing issues, but overall, this was a sophisticated and heartfelt performance. Well done!""

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
""Darlings, you were like two classic Hollywood stars out there! Addison, your charm lit up the floor, and Selena, your elegance was exquisite. The duet section could have been sharper, but the overall performance was stylish and full of grace. Fabulous!""

**Scores: 9, 9, 9 (27/30)**

Still solid scores for them! Here is the updated leaderboard at the end of R2!

1. Sabrina and Brandon/Bruno and Daniella (60)
2. N/A
3. Addison and Pasha (56)
4. Selena and Val (54)

**Bruno Tonioli:**

The routine opens with Sabrina in a shimmering, playful outfit, center stage, as the iconic opening beats of *Shake It Off* play. Brandon joins her with a fun, high-energy sequence as they immediately pull the audience into a vibrant performance. The choreography is a brilliant fusion of multiple styles, showcasing Sabrina’s versatility. Brandon incorporates fast-paced Jive kicks, cheeky Charleston flair, and smooth Jazz-inspired sections. The transitions between styles are seamless, with the routine flowing effortlessly from one energetic sequence to the next. Sabrina’s footwork is sharp and precise, her timing flawless, and her connection with Brandon is stronger than ever. The middle of the routine features an eye-popping lift, with Brandon spinning Sabrina effortlessly as she strikes a confident pose mid-air. The performance also includes clever use of props—a bright pink microphone stand Sabrina playfully incorporates during a solo moment before tossing it aside and jumping back into a synchronized section with Brandon. The most memorable moment of the routine comes during the celebrity solo, where Sabrina takes center stage, executing a dynamic blend of contemporary movements and freestyle grooves, completely owning the dance floor. Brandon joins her for a thrilling final sequence, ending with an explosive series of spins that lead into a playful, carefree final pose.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""Sabrina, this freestyle was like a burst of sunshine! You brought so much joy, energy, and personality to the floor. Your growth from Week 1 to now is undeniable, and this performance just reminded us why you’ve been such a star all season. If I were to say one thing, it would be that the freestyle round is that chance to deliver a ""wow moment"" and you did every part of that routine perfectly, there wasn't a moment that made me go ""wow"" but that doesn't take away from how incredible you've been all season as well as tonight.""

I can’t tell if this is dietary or blood pressure.

Today I had 1 protein waffle, lots of water, 1 cup of coffee with almond milk, and have been working on an apple (it’s 11am here).


 I see the results and don’t want to quit but this is really hard for me raising my active and little kids.

The universe recently thrust me into the depths of RAID array rebuilding, and boy, what an eye-opening experience it turned out to be. Grab a coffee - I'm about to spill some hard-earned wisdom that might save your digital bacon one day.

Let's shatter a myth right off the bat: **RAID 1 isn't your digital guardian angel**. Sure, it mirrors data like a champ, but don't mistake that for immortality. When my first drive started throwing tantrums, I learned this lesson in vivid, heart-pounding detail.

Before you dive into rebuilding, here's what nobody tells you...

Your pre-rebuild checklist should be sacred:

* Backup everything. Seriously. Every. Single. Byte.
* Run health checks (but steer clear of CHKDSK - that's like performing surgery with a sledgehammer)
* Line up fresh drives like soldiers ready for battle

The rebuild itself? Picture a high-stakes dance:

1. Power down completely - no shortcuts
2. Navigate BIOS/UEFI (or the RAID building software you use) like you're defusing a bomb
3. Settle in for the long haul - my rebuild meandered through ninety nail-biting minutes
4. Keep your hands off new data during the process
5. Treat power interruptions like your mortal enemy

Here's what caught me off guard:

⛔ Those drives with sketchy sectors? Don't even think about it

⛔ Previously failed RAID drives belong in the recycling bin, not your array

⛔ Mixing drive types is like wearing socks with sandals - technically possible, but why would you?

⛔ Regular health checks aren't paranoia, they're survival

The real shocker? RAID 1's performance feels like watching a snail move. But for my document collection, I'll take that.

Want the full technical deep-dive? Check out (I got the summary from here) [https://www.diskinternals.com/raid-recovery/rebuild-raid-1-without-losing-data/](https://www.diskinternals.com/raid-recovery/rebuild-raid-1-without-losing-data/)

My biggest takeaway? **RAID isn't some set-it-and-forget-it miracle**. It demands attention, respect, and occasional tender loving care. 

Drop your questions below. While I'm no silicon valley guru, I've got fresh battle scars and stories to share.

This might be an overreaction, but i just wanna vent because I can’t really say anything to anyone. It seems that at other restaurants, owners will come in and be part of the team and help out and chat with their employees, but that has never happened here.

I’m a 40-year-old male based in the UK and looking for advice from anyone who has experienced similar symptoms.

For the past three weeks, I’ve been experiencing an urge to urinate every two hours during the day. My urine flow feels slower than usual, and I often have a heavy sensation in my lower abdomen after emptying my bladder, as if it’s not completely empty.

I visited my GP, who performed a DRE (digital rectal exam) and ordered a PSA test. Both were normal. A urine dipstick test ruled out a UTI, but my urine sample was sent for further culture testing. The results showed a red blood cell (RBC) count of 38 and white blood cells (WBC) at 7. I’m wondering if this is a cause for concern.

I don’t experience these symptoms at night and can usually sleep through without waking to urinate, though I’ve woken up to pee a couple of times during this period. I’m sexually active, but these symptoms began about two weeks after my last sexual activity. My partner has no symptoms, so I don’t think this is related to an STI.


I don’t consume coffee, tea, or fizzy drinks.

I’m not experiencing any back pain, weight loss, or other pain.

There’s occasional urgency to urinate, possibly with a burning sensation.

To stay visible, competitive, and ahead of the curve in 2025, you need an omnipresent approach. Here’s how to get started—no budget required!

# 1️⃣ Go Beyond Google

Your audience isn’t just searching on Google anymore. They’re exploring:  
🔍 **Social media platforms** like TikTok, LinkedIn, and Reddit for ideas and recommendations.  
🛒 **E-commerce sites** like Amazon to find and compare products.  
🎥 **Video platforms** like YouTube for tutorials, reviews, and how-tos.

**Pro Tip:** Customize content for each platform. Short videos, detailed posts, or engaging visuals—meet your audience where they are.

# 2️⃣ Build Authority in Your Niche

Don’t try to be everything for everyone. Focus on becoming the go-to expert for your product or service.  
📚 **Example:** If you sell coffee, create content around topics like ""best brewing methods"" or ""how to choose coffee beans.""

By organizing content into **clusters** around specific topics, you strengthen your expertise and improve rankings for related searches.

# 3️⃣ Simplify Your Content Strategy

Here’s a straightforward approach anyone can follow:  
1️⃣ **Pick a Topic:** Research what your customers are curious about.  
2️⃣ **Create Platform-Specific Content:** Tailor each piece for the platform—short clips for TikTok, in-depth articles for LinkedIn, and eye-catching visuals for Instagram.  
3️⃣ **Share and Promote:** Get your content in front of as many eyes as possible.  
4️⃣ **Learn and Optimize:** Measure performance and adjust your strategy.  
5️⃣ **Repeat:** SEO is a journey, not a sprint—consistency is key!

# 4️⃣ Prepare for the AI Era

AI platforms like OpenAI and Perplexity are becoming search engines in their own right. Stay ahead by making your content AI-friendly:  
💡 Use clear headings and bullet points for easy understanding.  
🧠 Incorporate **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** principles to align with how AI ""reads"" content.

Optimizing for AI ensures you’re ready for the future of search.

# 5️⃣ Stay Visible on Google’s New SERP

Google’s Search Engine Results Page (SERP) is changing fast, with:

* **Local packs** to highlight businesses near your customers.
* **Featured snippets** offering instant answers to questions.
* **People Also Ask (PAA)** sections for related queries.
* **AI overviews** that summarize key insights.

**Quick Wins:**  
✅ Claim your **Google Business Profile** to dominate local search.  
✅ Provide concise answers to frequently asked questions in your industry to rank for **featured snippets.**

# 💡 Final Tip

SEO in 2025 is all about being where your audience is searching. By adopting these strategies, you’ll not only stay relevant but thrive in a competitive digital landscape—all without spending a penny.",1,1737474271.0,u_KKStrategy,0,1.0,False

For the past three weeks, I’ve been experiencing an urge to urinate every two hours during the day. My urine flow feels slower than usual, and I often have a heavy sensation in my lower abdomen after emptying my bladder, as if it’s not completely empty.

I visited my GP, who performed a DRE (digital rectal exam) and ordered a PSA test. Both were normal. A urine dipstick test ruled out a UTI, but my urine sample was sent for further culture testing. The results showed a red blood cell (RBC) count of 38 and white blood cells (WBC) at 7. I’m wondering if this is a cause for concern.

I don’t experience these symptoms at night and can usually sleep through without waking to urinate, though I’ve woken up to pee a couple of times during this period. I’m sexually active, but these symptoms began about two weeks after my last sexual activity. My partner has no symptoms, so I don’t think this is related to an STI.


I don’t consume coffee, tea, or fizzy drinks.

I’m not experiencing any back pain, weight loss, or other pain.

There’s occasional urgency to urinate, possibly with a burning sensation.


Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",1,1737474046.0,OveractiveBladder,0,1.0,False

1i6lceq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1i6lceq/cold_medicine_sudafed_induced_insomnia_and_sleep/,Cold Medicine (Sudafed) Induced Insomnia and Sleep Anxiety? ,"Hello,

I'm going to do my best to keep this brief but it's been a ride and I'm looking for any and all insight that may help. It's a little stream of conscious-y and I know a lot of it goes beyond the scope of Sleep, but I appreciate any who take the time to read though. Here goes.

I woke up the morning of NYE super sick. I probably slept 36 of the following 48 hours. Unfortunately this turned into bronchitis. Doc gave me antibiotics which seemed to help get rid of the ""sick"" part of the equation, now I'm working through the weeks of congestion after. To help manage that I was taking Sudafed (pseudoephedrine). After a week and half I noticed I wasn't feeling myself but couldn't place it. After two weeks I started having terrible sleep, as well as a constant, unshakable anxiety that also manifested into my legs (like they absolutely have to move. Horrible at night, it almost forces me to jump out of bed and walk around) and 24/7 severe dry mouth that was annoying during the day and absolutely impossible to ignore at night, leading to further sleeplessness.

On January 14 I had enough and went to urgent care to just talk to a doctor about what was going on. The conclusion was more or less ""you've been Sudafed for how long?! You need to stop that immediately"" and I did. My last Sudafed was that morning, before going to the doctor. He said for most people Sudafed is 4 or 5 day thing at most, and definitely not before bed since it's basically an amohetamine. I had no idea! The urgent care doc said he doesn't usually prescribe sedatives or sleep aids because he feels that's a bigger conversation to be had with PCPs or mental health experts. Fair. But he did recommend melatonin and Benadryl to help. Also worth noting is that Sudafed takes about 4 days to totally exit your system.

Since then it's been a week of trial and mostly error of finding my best sleep. The first night I tried loading up on everything. 1mg Melatonin, 25mg Benadryl, and at the suggestion of my partner, a THC/CBD/CBN gummy made to promote sleep (drugs are not my thing, but I'm desperate.) Absolutely wild dreams, and the dry mouth flared up so horribly. I maybe got 2.5 hours initially then managed to get another hour after tending to the dry mouth

The next night I omitted the melatonin. Seemed to help the dreams, dry mouth still strong.

I won't go through the whole week since urgent care line by line, but here are some thoughts and observations. 

- Up until these events sleep was never really an issue for me. I never thought about it. I could just sleep or nap when I wanted without issue. I am shocked how much has changed in three weeks. 

- Being off Sudafed has helped dramatically, especially after the four day period for it to leave the system. I have felt more like myself, and the constant drymouth is subsiding, more and more each day. I know it will take time for my body to return to where it was, but this gives me optimism.

- Balancing meds to help manage bronchitis and get good sleep is tough. It feels like I'm fighting on multiple fronts. But I think I found a good balance of things that at the very least shouldn't make sleep worse. Basically ibuprofen and Mucinex during the day, ibuprofen and DXM (delsyn) at night. 

- I am currently off all stimulants, minus one morning cup of coffee. Otherwise herbal tea all day including plenty of chamomile before bed.

- I have definitely developed an anxiety over sleep itself. Between wanting to get as much sleep as possible to recover from bronchitis and wanting to get back to the sleep I used to be able to get and know I'm capable of, I'm dreading going to bed to find out ""how bad"" it will be. This has extended to lying down in any capacity. In bed, on the covers, on my phone? No go. Anxiety spikes. Lying on the couch on phone? Anxiety. I cancelled a deep tissue massage because I don't think I can handle lying there like that. 

- No naps. That anxiety has made it near impossible anyway. I have dozed off while sitting up and watching TV before bed. The timing isn't ideal but I'm also at a point where I'll take sleep any way I can get it. 

- I am getting back into my routine, which I'm feeling with help with the anxiety further. I've been back in the gym for a week and will be going back to work tomorrow after three weeks off from the bronchitis. More optimism.

- I have been told I overthink health related things too much and that I'm creating a new source of anxiety by doing so. I don't disagree. I wouldn't say I'm a hypochondriac, though there have been moments, but I'd say I worry about health issues a lot when they come up and my brain often goes worst case scenario until I talk to a doctor. 

- I'm not familiar enough with weed and my body to know if it's helping. Once night I used only weed gummies and slept 3.5 hours before the dry mouth stopped me. Last night I made it an hour and a half before I was up and trying to calm my mind through some random scenario in absolute gibberish. And they really cause the dry mouth to act up. I think I'm eliminating these.

- A friend who I was talking with about this had some ambien that he gave me on January 19th. I know. I know. I was hesitant, but desperate. I took 5mg (and nothing else, no chamomile or weed or cough syrup. I checked all interactions) and slept a solid 6.5 hours. I was elated. I learned later in the day on my computer that I was sleep googling ""Ambien isn't working"" about half way through that sleep. I have no memory of that, and that scares me a little bit. I've read Ambien stories and the idea of not being in control like that doesn't sit well with me. Part of me wants to take another 5mg for the solid sleep, part of me knows I need to talk to my PCP and that part is winning. 

- I am, tragically, a mouth breather while sleeping. I can breathe through my nose up to the point of sleeping, but then immediately start mouth breathing. These last three weeks have taught me that I need to go an ENT to try and address my breathing, tongue placement, and all that, but that problem will not be solved tonight. To that end, I'm hesitant to employ mouth tape and such until I talk to an ENT to assess my situation.

- I have started using xylimelts to help with the drymouth. It makes a huge difference, but it's only been a couple days and I'm still getting used to the feel of them in my mouth. But I'm willing to keep trying with those.

- I have a video visit with my PCP Thursday because getting to see a doctor in person these days is so hard. I will be discussing all of this with him. 

- I am researching therapists to start CBT and tackle these anxieties and how much of a worrier I apparently am. 

And I think that's everything. If nothing else writing it all out helps organize my thoughts. Thank you to any who read though this. Any and all insight is appreciated.

Imagine ***R*****eddit** designed a own television. Like, all of us here—Reddit’s hive mind of tech nerds, movie buffs, sports addicts, meme lords, and international culture junkies.

What would that look like?

Here’s what I’m thinking:

* **Every channel, ever.** No missing games. No blacked-out regions. No weird paywalls to watch the latest episode of *The Last of Us*.
* **Cheap as hell.** $10–$20 max. No sneaky fees. No contracts. Just “shut up and take my money” vibes.
* **4K streams or nothing.** None of that grainy, pixelated nonsense. We deserve crisp visuals that make us feel like we’re in the stadium—or the middle of a high-speed car chase.
* **Global content.** Bollywood, K-dramas, anime, Turkish dramas, niche Euro indie films… let’s make the *entire world* our binge-worthy playground.
* **No ads. Ever.** Because if I see another pharmaceutical ad with bad stock footage, I might throw my remote at the wall.

Sound like a dream? Well, guess what—it already exists. And it’s called **IPTV.**

# 📺 Why IPTV Feels Like It Was Made for Reddit

If Reddit is all about freedom, choice, and sharing what’s awesome, IPTV is the perfect match. Let’s break it down:

# 1️⃣ Every Channel You Can Think Of (and a Ton You Can’t)

IPTV has EVERYTHING. Live sports? Check. On-demand movies? Check. International channels? Double check. Stuff you didn’t even know you wanted? Oh yeah.

Services like [**IPTVGREAT**](http://iptvgreat.xyz) and [**IPTVFOLLOW**](http://iptvfollow.com) don’t just give you the usual lineup—they let you explore *everything*. Watching the cricket World Cup live from India while flipping over to a random Japanese game show? Totally doable.

# 2️⃣ 10/10 Reddit-Approved Pricing

Cable’s pricing model is basically: “What if we charged you the price of a car payment but gave you reruns of *Friends*?”

IPTV is like, “What if we gave you literally everything for the cost of a takeout meal?”

Platforms like [**IPTVTOPS**](http://iptvtops.com) and [**IPTVUNLOCK**](http://iptvunlock.com) start as low as $10 a month. That’s less than your monthly coffee budget—*and you get WAY more out of it.*

# 3️⃣ The ULTIMATE Sports Hack

Sports fans, you know the struggle:

* Local blackouts.
* Regional restrictions.
* “This game is unavailable in your area.”
* Scrolling Twitter for a sketchy live stream that dies 10 minutes in.

IPTV solves ALL of this. Providers like [**IPTVGREAT**](http://iptvgreat.xyz) and [**IPTVGEAR**](http://iptvgear.org) give you access to **every live game**, **every league**, and even international matches. Whether it’s the NBA Finals, the UEFA Champions League, or an obscure curling championship in Canada (don’t judge), IPTV’s got you covered.

# 4️⃣ One Subscription, Infinite Access

Here’s the best part: IPTV doesn’t care where you are or what device you’re using.

* Want to watch on your Smart TV? Done.
* Need to stream on your phone while waiting for your food delivery? Easy.
* Traveling and want to binge your favorite show from a hotel in Japan? Still good.

With services like [**IPTVRESALE**](http://iptvresale.com) and [**IPTVGANG**](http://iptvgang.me), your subscription follows you everywhere.

# 5️⃣ Ad-Free Everything

Nothing kills the vibe faster than ads. You’re in the middle of a gripping scene, and BOOM—here’s a local car dealership yelling at you to buy a used SUV.

With IPTV, you don’t have to suffer. Providers like [**IPTVFOLLOW**](http://iptvfollow.com) and [**IPTVRIGHT**](http://iptvright.com) deliver pure, uninterrupted content. It’s just you, your snacks, and the good stuff.

# 🤔 Is IPTV the Secret Reddit Hack of the Decade?

Okay, so maybe Reddit didn’t *literally* invent IPTV, but it sure feels like it did. IPTV ticks all the boxes we care about:

* It’s affordable.
* It works everywhere.
* It’s packed with endless entertainment.
* And it’s stupidly easy to set up.

If you’re still holding onto cable like it’s 2008, I need you to sit down, pour yourself a drink, and reconsider your life choices.

# 🌟 How to Start Streaming Like a Reddit Pro

Here’s how I broke free and joined the IPTV revolution:

# 📣 Reddit, It’s Time to Upgrade Your TV Game

1i6l7yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstatePhotography/comments/1i6l7yo/rep_business_guidance/,REP Business Guidance,"I've been full time with my REP business for almost two years now.

For about 6 months now I've been averaging 10k a month. I currently have an editor and an executive assistant of sorts that helps with video edits, social media, onsite shooting and other various tasks I occasionally delegate.

Our region has close to 500 realtors in the local association, though density is not high geographically speaking. We just moved platforms about 4 months ago and had close to 100 realtors signed up before the move. We have 65 signed up and booked at least one job with us already on the new platform.

According to census data and focusing on the major cities that are within 25miles, there are roughly 60,000 housing units.

First question is more generic.. what should be my next move? What should I be looking at for company growth?

I feel like most companies that I use for reference claim to have four photographers and an office admin on the pay roll. Though the platform I'm on now offers the ability to add commissions on services for photographers.

Should I look at hiring photographers or using contractors on commission? And what would commission look like?

My biggest fear right now is being understaffed for Spring. We hit 10k during our slow season and I'm afraid that indicates that we'll be swamped during peak season.

I have never wanted to grow so big that I have to step away from the field work to focus on just the business side of things. But I've warmed up to the idea recently and see it as the best option to keep growing and reach financial stability for the company. This would allow us to have reps closer to each of the cities, tapping into some of the larger markets, eventually.

What is everyone offering for video products? I see a market available for short form content, but I can seem to nail down any sense of a definition for our short form products. Anything I come up with either feels too generic, thus creates too much of a workload for my team, or it is not inclusive enough and leaves too much untouched.

As an example I think property shorts is a good definition and add-on for our cine package. But does that only include clips of the property, or do we allow the agent screen time? Do we include on-screen factoids about the property? Do we include or exclude agent branding?

What I feel like we're missing here is something along the lines of agent skits. Where the agent is on screen in some sort of fun way, or even just highlighting features of a property. But this also seems like it would increase overhead.

Life style shorts is something I can't decide if I want to touch, cause it seems like it is too far removed from listing media. An example of this would be an agent sitting at a coffee shop just sipping from their cup and smiling, with some sort of informational text overlayed.

The commercial market is something I've barely tapped into. Realtors and Construction/Architect companies keep using us, but keep assuming that our real estate pricing is the same as our commercial pricing. Though our terms dictate that they're only allowed to use the media to represent the property in sale and the license ends after one year or when their representation of the property ends. We've had people book us, and not tell us that the job was commercial, the property was not for sale, and that they intend to use our work for marketing purposes. We have also done commercial properties for sale, where the realtor gives the new owner our works and the new owner uses those to promote their new business.

My question here is, how do we remedy this moving forward? Also, our platform doesn't really have a solution for adding a commercial license ""option."" Unless we add it as a flat rate add-on. We could go back in after a shoot and adjust the invoice, but that seems a bit tedious. We haven't really fought anyone on this because we were more focused on building relationships and our client base, but we're at a point now where the added income from these higher dollar jobs would really help us.",3,1737473602.0,RealEstatePhotography,0,0.8,False

Let's try a second time, this time following the guidelines and with extra passion.

* The product

Sponsorble ([sponsorble.com](http://sponsorble.com)) let's site owners monetize their site by adding paid-for messages from their supporters. 

It's like a combination of Buy Me a Coffee and AdSense, but without all the privacy-invading bullshit that comes with Adsense. Because there are no cookies being set, there's no need for a cookie banner.

The owner/blogger/creator adds the Sponsorble ""Sponsor me"" button to their site. The sponsor can choose to sponsor the site for X days, with the price being determined by the site owner (or based on the number of views), with their message being displayed on a banner or ad.

Sponsorble handles all the technical stuff, such as managing the campaign and payments, and gives the owner the tools needed to acquire sponsors.

Sponsors pay the site owner directly via Stripe, with Sponsorble taking a commission.

* The market (size, competition, dynamics that we should be aware of)

Online advertising is huge, but so is the competition. I think the combination of ""supporter powered"" ads, along with the privacy aspect of direct sponsorships is a niche worth considering. There are other privacy-focussed apps (eg. Plausible analytics) that have established traction and this could be another,

* Product analysis / comparison against competition

As mentioned the two big competitors are paid ads (Adsense, Mediavine, etc.) and supporter donations (BMaC, Ki-fi, Patron, etc.)

The trouble with Adsense: privacy nightmare, tracking, data sharing, requires approval and minimum traffic levels, generally horrible experience for publishers and readers.

The trouble with BMaC, Ko-fi etc: You get nothing in return except the warm fuzzy feeling of keeping your favourite creator in ramen for another day.

* What stage are you in? Do you need money? Are you raising?

Idea stage. I've made a landing page with a sign-up form but that's about all. Oh - of course I've bought a domain because reasons.

* Customer conversion strategy (where do you find them, and how do you make them buy shit from you)

So I need to reach site owners (who have control of their site code) to add a javascript script link, or for bloggers a WordPress plugin to make the magic happen. I'll reach them on social, reddit and ""how to make money with my blog"" seo.

Eventually I'd like to have team functionality and get this into agencies alongside AdSense.

* Why you? 

Why me? I'm a pretty solid dev who has built many apps before, and this is pretty standard stuff. This is a pretty small build in my opinion (initally a CRUD app with Stripe integration) but have some good product ideas going forward. But for now I want to get a basic product in front of people and see what the uptake is. Marketing is my kryptonite so that's where I need to focus my efforts.

The landing page is a work in progress and I'd love to hear if the proposition is clear or not before burning more time on it!",1,1737473497.0,roastmystartup,0,1.0,False

### The Authority of the Church and the Apostolic Mission: A Refutation of Sola Scriptura  

#### Introduction  
At the heart of Christianity lies the question of authority: who has the power to teach, interpret, and preserve the truth revealed by God? Protestants often adhere to *sola scriptura*, the doctrine that the Bible alone is the ultimate authority in matters of faith and practice. However, this position neglects the essential role of the Church as the guardian of divine truth, a role established by Christ Himself and perpetuated through the apostles and their successors. By examining the scriptural, historical, and theological evidence, we will demonstrate that sola scriptura is both unscriptural and insufficient. The authority of the Church, grounded in apostolic succession and divine mandate, is essential for understanding and receiving the fullness of divine revelation.  

---  

#### Faith: Human and Divine  
Faith is the foundation of belief, but not all faith is equal. The Church distinguishes between human faith and divine faith. Human faith is the natural trust we place in others based on their credibility. For example, if someone introduces themselves in a coffee shop and shares details about their life, we might believe them, but our belief is contingent and fallible. Divine faith, on the other hand, is the unconditional acceptance of truth revealed by God. In John 6, Jesus taught about the necessity of eating His flesh and drinking His blood for eternal life—a teaching many found incomprehensible and rejected. Yet Peter responded, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life” (John 6:68). This is divine faith: trusting in Christ’s words, even when they surpass human understanding.  

---  

#### The Apostles’ Authority: Divine Mandate and Mission  
Jesus, who teaches with divine authority, entrusted this authority to His apostles, making them the foundation of the Church. He declared, “He who hears you hears Me, and he who rejects you rejects Me” (Luke 10:16). This transmission of authority is evident throughout the New Testament.  

##### Barnabas and Saul: The Significance of Being “Apostled”  
Acts 13:1-3 provides a striking example of the Church exercising its divine authority to commission preachers. In the Church at Antioch, the Holy Spirit declared, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” The Church responded by fasting, praying, laying hands on them, and sending them off. The Greek word used for “sent” (*apesteilan*) shares its root with *apostolos* (“one who is sent”) and underscores the official commissioning of Barnabas and Saul as missionaries of the Church.  

This act of being “apostled” is profoundly significant for several reasons:  

1. **The Role of the Church**: The Church at Antioch did not merely endorse Barnabas and Saul; it discerned the Holy Spirit’s will and authorized their mission. This highlights the Church’s role as the instrument through which divine authority is exercised on Earth.  
2. **Commissioning with Authority**: The laying on of hands signifies more than a blessing—it conveys authority and marks the recipients as official representatives of Christ and His Church. Without this commissioning, their mission would lack legitimacy.  
3. **Paul’s Recognition of Apostolic Sending**: In Romans 10:14-15, Paul asks, “How can men preach unless they are sent?” (*apostellō*). This rhetorical question underscores that preaching the Gospel requires more than personal conviction; it requires authorization from the Church. The event in Acts 13 demonstrates this principle in action, as Paul and Barnabas were not self-appointed but sent by the Church, confirming their mission’s legitimacy.  

The act of being “apostled” ties directly to the concept of apostolic succession. Just as Barnabas and Saul were sent by the Church, so too does the Church today continue to send ministers who act in the name of Christ. This authority is not self-assumed but conferred through the visible, hierarchical Church established by Christ.

#### Oral Tradition and Written Scripture: Equal Authorities  
A key flaw of sola scriptura is its failure to account for the oral teachings of the apostles, which were equally authoritative. Paul writes in 1 Thessalonians 2:13, “When you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God.” Here, Paul affirms that his oral preaching is the word of God, not merely human instruction. Similarly, John states in 1 John 4:6, “Whoever knows God listens to us; he who is not of God does not listen to us.” Acceptance of apostolic teaching, both oral and written, is necessary for discerning the spirit of truth from the spirit of error.  

The insufficiency of sola scriptura becomes evident when we consider that much of the apostles’ teaching was never written down. The New Testament, comprising 27 books, cannot encompass the entirety of the apostles’ three years of preaching, teaching, and guiding the early Church. Yet their oral teachings were binding, as demonstrated by the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, where the apostles and elders, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, issued a binding decision for all Christians. This decision was authoritative, even though it was not initially codified in scripture.  

---

#### Apostolic Succession: The Perpetuation of Authority  
The authority given to the apostles did not end with their deaths. In Acts 1:20-26, Peter initiated the replacement of Judas with Matthias, emphasizing that the apostolic office is an enduring institution. The term “office” (*episkopē*) signifies a position meant to be filled perpetually. This practice continued in the early Church, as seen in the writings of Church Fathers like Ignatius of Antioch, who declared, “Wherever the bishop appears, there let the multitude be; even as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church” (*Letter to the Smyrnaeans, 8*). Ignatius, a disciple of the apostle John, recognized the bishops as successors to the apostles, holding the same authority to teach and govern the faithful.  

St. Augustine echoed this sentiment, stating, “I would not believe in the Gospel had not the authority of the Catholic Church already moved me” (*Against the Epistle of Manichaeus*, 5.6). Augustine recognized that the Church’s authority is the means by which the Gospel’s inherent authority is made known. The Church is the custodian of divine revelation, ensuring its accurate transmission and interpretation.  

---

#### The Infallibility of the Church  
A common objection to the Church’s authority is the fallibility of its members. Critics point to Peter’s denial of Christ or his failure to eat with Gentiles in Galatians 2:11-14 as evidence against apostolic infallibility. However, these examples highlight the distinction between personal sin and teaching authority. Peter’s actions were fallible, but his doctrinal teaching, such as his declaration at the Council of Jerusalem, was guided by the Holy Spirit and free from error.  

The Church’s infallibility does not mean that its leaders are sinless but that, when teaching on matters of faith and morals, they are protected by the Holy Spirit from teaching error. This charism of infallibility is necessary for the Church to fulfill its role as “the pillar and foundation of truth” (1 Timothy 3:15). Without it, the faithful could have no certainty about what to believe, and the unity of the Church would dissolve into chaos.  

---

#### The Bible and the Church: An Inseparable Relationship  
The claim that “a fallible Church cannot produce an infallible Bible” underscores a profound truth. The Bible’s authority is inseparable from the authority of the Church that recognized, preserved, and canonized it. The Church did not create scripture but discerned, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, which writings were inspired. This process was not arbitrary but the fulfillment of Christ’s promise that the Holy Spirit would guide the Church into all truth (John 16:13).  

Protestants accept the New Testament canon, yet they fail to acknowledge the Church’s role in defining it. Without an infallible Church, the canon of scripture becomes a matter of human opinion, subject to doubt and revision. This reliance on human faith, rather than divine faith, undermines the very foundation of sola scriptura.  

---

#### Conclusion  
The authority of the Church, rooted in Christ’s mandate to the apostles and perpetuated through their successors, is indispensable for understanding and receiving divine revelation. Sola scriptura, by rejecting this authority, severs the link between God’s revelation and its transmission to humanity. The example of Barnabas and Saul being “apostled” demonstrates the Church’s active role in commissioning and legitimizing divine teaching. To reject the Church is to reject the very means by which Christ continues to teach and sanctify His people. In the words of St. Ignatius, “Wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.”",2,1737472605.0,Christianity,5,0.75,False
1i6ku06,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFitStories/comments/1i6ku06/gluco_extend_review_plantbased_blood_sugar/,Gluco Extend Review: Plant-Based Blood Sugar Support with Real Results,"Managing blood sugar levels is no picnic. Whether it’s that rollercoaster of energy dips or those relentless sugar cravings whispering sweet nothings to your pantry, it’s a struggle that affects both mind and body.

Fortunately, there’s Gluco Extend, a plant-based supplement designed to bring a little order to the chaos. Let’s dig in to see if this product lives up to the hype or if it’s just another bottle gathering dust on your shelf.

**Product Overview**

Product Name: Gluco Extend

Category: Plant-Based Blood Sugar Supplement

Overall Verdict: 4.5/5

**Key Ingredients and Benefits**

Gluco Extend is packed with herbal glucose support ingredients that work together to promote balance and energy. Here’s a quick rundown of its all-stars:

Bitter Melon: Mimics insulin to help your body manage glucose naturally.

Cinnamon Bark: Famous for improving insulin sensitivity, this spice goes beyond its dessert duties.

Gymnema Sylvestre: Known as the “sugar destroyer,” it helps reduce sugar absorption and cravings.

Banaba Leaf: Contains corosolic acid, which supports glucose uptake and insulin activity.

Alpha Lipoic Acid: A powerful antioxidant that fights oxidative stress while boosting energy metabolism.

This combination makes Gluco Extend a safe blood sugar supplement choice for those who want to address these issues without synthetic chemicals.

**Who Should Use It**

If you’re someone who struggles with fluctuating blood sugar levels or wants to maintain energy throughout the day, Gluco Extend might be your new best friend. It’s especially appealing for achieving blood sugar control naturally.

And vegans, vegetarians, or anyone focused on plant-based living will appreciate its ethical formulation.

**Safety and Side Effects**

As a safe blood sugar supplement, Gluco Extend generally plays nice with your body. Some users report mild digestive discomfort when starting out, but this usually fades as your system adjusts. As always, check with your doctor if you’re already taking medications or other supplements.

**Personal Experience (Through Jackie’s Eyes)**

Jackie, my neighbor’s mom, has always been the go-to person for natural health advice in our community.

When I mentioned I was researching Gluco Extend, she lit up and told me she had been using it for a few months. Curious to hear her thoughts, I asked her to share her experience.

Jackie explained that after struggling with fluctuating blood sugar levels and constant fatigue, she decided to give Gluco Extend a try.

Within a couple of weeks, she noticed a marked improvement in her energy and found herself reaching for fewer sugary snacks—a win-win for both her health and her pantry budget.

She also appreciated the simplicity of the supplement: just a couple of capsules with her morning coffee, and she was good to go.

However, she did mention one small hiccup. The first few days brought a bit of stomach upset, but this faded quickly as her body adjusted.

Overall, she was thrilled with the results and even recommended it to a few of her friends at her weekly yoga class. Hearing her story firsthand only reinforced my belief in the product’s effectiveness.

**Pros and Cons**

Today was different tho as I went with my father and siblings to get some chips before heading to school I saw him buying something he bought it and left quickly I thought he just left quickly as he didn't like me or as usual just not wanting to say anything but when I told my best friend that he asked him jokingly how was the coffee he remembered seeing me and apologised for not saying anything saying he didn't want my dad to think I was friend with a  delinquent like him self.

1i6kogo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1i6kogo/notes_on_a_relapse/,"Notes on a ""relapse""","After 2-3 years of unsucessfully quitting, i finally put down vaping and cigarettes 2 months ago.  When I quit, I turned inwards.  I avoided all social contact for a while.  Plans with friends would traditionally get in my way of seeing a smoke free future because thinking of future parties, events, and gatherings where I would enjoy the presence of smoke made me think I couldnt quit now.  When I couldnt see a smoke free future, I couldnt live it.  So going off the radar gave me the space to develop new habits.  The past two months have been awesome.  I got my mind straight about a lot of things, I leaned into my creativity instead of spending time with others, I focused on my diet and exercise, and woke up every morning excited to be alive, and went to sleep each night comfortably feeling excited to tack on another day of health and wellness.

But there was this nagging feeling that I wanted a smoke.  Like actually, although I was in the gym 4 days a week and running several miles on 2-3 days, my lungs felt like they needed smoke for their own health.  A weird sensation for sure.  I fought it, but it kept building.

The day before yesterday I bummed a smoke from a dude on the street and thoroughly enjoyed the smoke.  It was everything I thought it would be.  Relaxing, enjoyable, calming.

Then over the next few hours the damage a single cigarette entering a clean healthy environment can do became clear.  My energy levels dropped.  Random pains in chest started.  I couldnt breathe as calmly and deeply as before.  I realized that the cravings were going to come fast and hard now, worse than before, and I have to steel myself against them.  Which I did for the rest of that day.

The next day came and I made excuses, thinking smoking would help me think through a situation better.  I bought a pack of smokes, and over the course of the day, had 9.  Mostly with coffee, I still and always will love a cup of coffee and a cigarette.  But I noticed my skin looking unhealthier.  My energy levels lower.  I went to the gym, and wasnt breathing properly through exercises.  I created a very normal bedtime routine, and this night, I stayed up about 4 hours past the time I usually fall asleep, wired from the nicotine.  I did get some good creative work done though.  And when I was trying to fall asleep, I kept waking up, gasping for air.

I woke up today feeling hungover despite not having a drink in months.  My blood feels thicker and dirty.  I dont have the excitement to hit the gym straight away (which im doing anyway- cant let these things win).  Im realizing the cravings for a smoke were actually my mind rallying against the very strict and highly productive lifestyle I was cultivating the past few months since quitting.  So now I know, I just need to take it a little easier and enjoy life more.  It was never about the smoke, and I was good without them.

I have nrt patches in the mail arriving today, and Ill be slapping them on tomorrow morning and getting back to my health and wellness.  It was nice taking a break from my strict routine but smoke has no place in any kind of lifestyle I want.  Except for maybe the random cigarette when I am sitting at a cafe in paris, having coffee while watching people go to work.  Ill always allow a smoke in those situations, but I wont allow it to dictate my abilities.

If you want to quit, I recommend using the patches.  Before you put the first one on, stock your house with healthy foods you want to eat, buy detoxifying foods and drink lots of water with lemon and some pomegranate juice (cleans the blood).  Once you slap on the patch, obsess about eating healthy.  You will feel a difference in your body day one.  Then, get some movement in.  Go to the gym.  Go for a walk 3x as long as you would usually walk for if thats your thing.  You will begin to feel amazing in just 2-3 days, while your body is still getting the nicotine from the patches.  If you do it right, and dont force anything too hard, you'll feel a positive momentum.  Cancel any plans that are triggers, and have it in your mind that you will be avoiding them until you can safely re-integrate them into your life.  It is temporary this monk mode - your friends will still be there in a few months, but the negative health consequences from not quitting are forever.  Use your time in solitude to think, reflect, create, grow, heal yourself.  Not only can you quit smoking, you can use quitting as a springboard to become that person you always wanted to be.

She recently moved to Naples, so she doesn't have all the advice yet either. We are going for 10 days at the end of March, beginning of April. 

We feel we must visit Rome to see the typical things. 

An idea I had was to go to Rome, then after go to Tuscany and back down to Naples. Maybe a day trip to Pompeii. 

My husband and I's interest isn't so much in shopping or the usual tourist stuff. We like:

•old architecture with strong history, such as churches, castles, old towns, etc. 
• Nature such as mountains or beautiful landscape, hills etc. 
• Coffee 

So if it's easy enough to get there, I feel we'd like to see the mountains. We don't ski, so an area that has at least a good up close view of the mountains with maybe a couple trail access points would be great.

Let me know any recommendations you have. Especially if you live in or near Naples since that’s where she lives, we love little random places that no tourists would know about or go to, we like to explore the culture of where we go.

Just popped into my boutique and bought 1 sleeve to try it out and l made a cup on hot latte and it’s AMAZING. It’s very subtle but tastes like chocolate covered strawberries. I did add a tiny piece of chocolate to make it have a more chocolate and strawberry flavor and it works perfectly well. Can u guys recommend me more of ur favorite add ons that I make this coffee flavor better?

1i6kcyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1i6kcyd/debilitating_anxiety_family_issues/,"Debilitating Anxiety, Family Issues, Situationship-Stress?","I have moments where i suffer from anxiety. Usually it kicks in right as im waking up but last night it was so bad i kept tossing and turning and waking up. 

I had a fight with my family over text due to my mom wanting to make assumptions even though she doesn’t live in the same state and hasn’t for over 10 years. She decided to take what i told her and put it all in a group chat (not that I didn’t expect it she’s always done this with things people tell her) but my issue with her is instead of trying to mediate anything from a place of misinformation or a lack thereof, why not hear all sides thoroughly and then make an assessment? Especially since she’s someone that goes to therapy? 

The conversation involved how I used to work for a certain company that decided it was going to pull its business completely out of state. The goal was to bring all the money back inside the house because my state has too many liabilities. With that being said, the company caused the premiums of its clients to increase, and prevented us the contractors from being able to build and sell according to their needs. We lost most of our opportunities to the call center. 

I was commission + hourly originally but WFH. 
This dropped down to me independently contracting because i was on payroll WFH not able to sell thus not making commission. Eventually the stress of being rejected over and over killed my motivation and ambition and i started to realize i was hitting a wall. It was becoming more evident for me i needed to leave this field. 

Before leaving my goal was to land another job that would’ve paid me the same if not close. However everything i applied for—nothing landed in my lap.

This was a first for me. I had been applying and looking since 07/2023.I relinquished my official title with the company in October 2023. 

My family had stepped in to help me with rent and other things I couldn’t afford bill wise since that time. However—I live my with uncle who isn’t the most money-savvy. Over the summer he would turn the A/C off the entire day, knowing we had animals and of course myself. 

But in his efforts to be frugal, he would have all of us burn until he got home at 4pm. Now turning on the AC causes it to work 10x harder because it has to push all the heat out that’s been marinating for 8 hours. We lived on the second floor. Heat rises. You have animals (yours and mine) sweltering in the heat all day. 
He had a standing fan. (I bought this fan years ago for myself because he didn’t want to run the ac) but he took it for HIMSELF because he’s overweight and always hot. 

So wait. We have to burn then ENTIRE DAY but you get to come home and run the ac AND have the fan? What the hell? Mind you I’m his NEICE. Kinda odd for a man to do that. 

So I would make attempts to adjust the thermostat and he would always nag about the bill increasing. The bill isn’t increasing because of what I did. It’s increasing because you leave it off all day in the middle of the summer and come home after peak heat hour and blast the AC at 68 degrees. 

With that being said—that inadvertently caused my grandparents (who had been helping me pay him rent since July) to have to pay $100 extra for no reason because he made such a big deal about the bill increasing. 

This infuriated me because his own ignorance and refusal to listen to me is causing people helping me to have to pay more somewhere they shouldn’t. Thus causing me to have to hear complaints about them not being able to help me—thus adding to the pressure of me trying to find a job—which I’m being rejected for left and right. 

I have NEVER been rejected for jobs. Never. This was a first for me and it was consistent. Every door I tried to walk through closed. 

During this season of drought- my ex had been helping me stay afloat. Simple things we did for each other to help each other as much as possible so we didn’t have to rely on our families. (He ended up losing his job in December) 

The reason I allowed this was because again- it makes more sense to me to get the help outside as much as possible because while help is being offered to me inside, it’s also coming tandem with the reminder that it’s not easily done which I understand and appreciate very well. 

I thought about getting a bartending job/waitressing job/hell even considered stripping and sugar babying at one point because I was getting interviews but never a call back. To my family it looked like I didn’t give a shit. To my mom-the decade long absentee-it looks like I’m waiting for everyone to “come in and fix my problems” which to me seems like a deep rooted projection- considering she’s been needing my grandparents assistance well into her late 30’s. She’s only late 40’s early 50’s now. 

I’m 28. 

My mom abandoned me to live in CA when I was 10. I was left to live with my grandmother until freshman year of high school. While living with my grandmother I was put under strict control. I couldn’t leave the house/have friends over/go over with friends. I couldn’t ride my bike down the street. To the 4th mailbox and back. Weird shit. So I would sneak out when I could just to be able to explore areas of my neighborhood I had never seen on my own before. Places I had only seen while in the backseat of the car. 

When I moved back home from CA- my grandparents made sure to remind me all my problems started when my mom moved me out that way. I disagree. What seemed to happen was I learned how to be social and open and somewhat vulnerable while in California. The kids were free to be independent. They were free to be themselves. This is the time my step dad threw me into therapy because they realized I had a fear of speaking. (I would cry if someone made me order my own food in the drive thru) all of this was due to my grandparents locking me away in a room all the time. I had a fear of socializing. 

Eventually because of therapy I broke out of this but I knew how bad it was because I realized how sick with anxiety it always made me feel. 

I barely graduate high school when I move back because my grandmother wanted to resume control. Mind you my school was having events like homecoming/prom/etc. 
I wanted to participate. This was my senior year. The least I could be allowed to do is participate. Barely. But I was able to so thanks. 

I find out the day of graduation that I’m graduating. The only people that showed were my grandmother and my my aunt (who I’m not even close with idk why she was there but I was happy she even came because we are not close) my grandpa made it there afterwards and my mom watched the live recording from CA. 

I didn’t expect noise when my name was called. No. But what it made me realize when my name was called and I heard nothing while walking across the stage in comparison to the 300+ kids I graduated with, hit me hard. It was quiet and I felt more alone than I ever had because this time I was in an auditorium filled with millions of people. 2 of my own. Silence. 

I hurt. But I walked. I graduated. 
Shortly afterwards my grandmother finds me with my boyfriend at the time talking to his family about his next steps—she asks me in front of everyone why I’m not going to college on a scholarship. Ugly-embarrassing. Even his family was taken aback. They chimed in for me saying I would find something amazing to do don’t worry. I was just quiet. Hurt and angry but quiet. 

Everything I have ever done has been an effort to try to establish myself. Originally I started working not just to have my own money but to be able to make money to send to my mom. I wanted to help her in her struggle. I was waitressing (my grandmother kicked me out for getting this job because I would be getting home at 8pm) and for her that was late. Really it was about control because when I told her I got the job she wasn’t happy for me and instead interrogated me about the job. When I refused to quit, she kicked me out. I was 18. 

At 19 my mom told me to go live with my cousin and her husband who always gave me weirdo vibes since a kid. I refused tooth and nail at first but my mom told me to go and told me I was hardheaded and stubborn for not listening. So I go. Next thing I know her husband is calling me into the kitchen at midnight to tell me about sex dreams he had about my mother and I and would ask me if I was having sex/what type of positions i liked/and if I planned on having sex in his house or not. 

I was utterly disgusted. I refused to answer and backed out the conversation. I took my concerns to Facebook which I happened to be friends with his daughter at the time on it who saw the post and got upset. She decided to tell him about my post and he decided to call my grandpa and tell him I was at their house. (At the time they were trying to take my car away as a method to keep me inside the house even though they kicked me out)

He comes, I try to tell him what just happened, he doesn’t care to hear it but just only wants my car key. I have two keys. The spare was in the house. He and got into a physical altercation when I refused to give him my car key and he heard my mom’s voice on the phone because I called her to inform her of what was happening. He flips me and my head slams against the cement curb. He takes my car key and drives off into the night. My phone was broken and my head was bleeding. 

I call my dad whom I never talk to. Never reach out for (not worth a damn) and he arrives, makes friends with my cousins husband in front of me. I was sick. Disgusted. This was an opportunity for my dad to sell drugs to someone new. It wasn’t about his daughter. I was sick. But he took me to live with him. Ok 

I go there and turns out I won’t be living with him—I’m living as a roommate with his adult female friend. Let’s say late 30s. This was fine. However I needed work and food. My dad was literally in the same complex and had no cares about whether I was eating every day or not meanwhile he, my step mom and 5 siblings are eating good every day and night and I’m right there. Had I known they were cooking I would’ve walked over there. That’s what you are saying right? 

I did. Apparently there wasn’t enough they’ll make me some in the morning. Ok. So go to bed hungry and eat nachos they finally brought at 1pm the next day. Meanwhile they are literally next door. I didn’t want to intrude on them. Im the oldest but most separated. I didn’t want to take from my siblings. I was battling needing and morality. So instead I relented on sneaking to eat every now and then my dad’s friends frozen dinners who was buying those for his work lunch. He realized I wasn’t eating and they weren’t really providing for me in my time of need, so he himself would take me to get food and pay for it. This bothered me because he shouldn’t have been doing that for me. In my heart my dad should’ve. But my dad is allowing another grown man to care for his daughter. I mean shit I’m already living with the dude so no surprise there but again I wasn’t ungrateful. In a way I had peace finally because I could focus on getting myself together. 

I just didn’t know how to do it. I had no guidance. I just stabbed in the dark over and over until I stuck something. 

I move out of there and onto my own with a group of friends. By now I was working for Victoria Secret and it was awesome. It was my first real blazer and pant suit job. But I wasn’t making enough to sustain my bills on my own. My rent was $500. My phone was $80. I was only making $350 at the time. (I was part time). Eventually I balanced it out with a second job. Then I moved out. 

I move in with my new boyfriend at the time and here I end up staying away from home for the next 5 years. However this was an abusive relationship where I almost died 4 times. Trust me you if I would’ve known what abuse was I would’ve never sat in it. I didn’t know. A lot of how I was being treated I was already being treated like that at home. 

I normalized yelling and cursing and insulting. I normalized physical violence because that was all I grew up experiencing so I didn’t see what my ex was doing as abusive. I just thought damn everyone lives like this huh. Ok. 

5 years later we have a daughter. I call it quits on the relationship because it just didn’t improve. The small improvements we did make, he would destroy them right after by cheating or being abusive with me some other way. I didn’t want that life for my daughter. I was scared to be by myself with a baby on my hip but I knew that this decision was bigger than me and for her. So I ended the relationship and moved back home with my grandmother. 

Control control control. 

She wants to tell me how to care for my child. Everything I do is wrong. I ain’t shit. I’m a piece of shit pathetic excuse for a mother. Everything you can imagine to say I heard it. I heard it all. 

She wants me to put my ex on child support. She wants me to fight with him and be at odds. But also wants to tell me she wishes we would just get back together. I’m sorry. You want me to get back together with the man who almost killed me 4x, called CPS on me in an effort to get my daughter taken away out of spite and jealousy, beat the fuck out of me—and blatantly disrespected me and allowed his friends to do so the whole 5 years we were together? You want me to get back with the person who didn’t show up for me not 1 day during my pregnancy and we lived together? 

My first and only pregnancy. I was alone. Every doctor visit. Alone. During labor he hid in the corner. My grandmother held my hand. My step mother held my hand. My mom wasn’t even there. 

I was alone. 

I move out and into my uncles because my grandmother physically assaulted me (she’s a body builder mind you) because she got upset I refused to allow her to watch my daughter on Mother’s Day. Why? 

1. My daughter’s father and I had reached peace and understanding by this point. Through my grandmothers desire for us to be at odds it brought us to peace because we realized there was point in fighting each other especially since I have to fight everywhere else. He asked me if I wanted him to watch our daughter for the night so I could out for Mother’s Day dinner which I wasn’t expected but when he offered I was thankful. He comes to get my daughter like we agreed and my grandmother notices who was at the time—outside drinking with her friends and neighbors in her patio. 

All she wants to really do is prevent Dad from taking baby. We are politely telling her it’s okay we already made plans it’s fine. She gets upset and starts trying to force dad to leave baby with her. Alcohol on her breath. He smells it and calmly tells her no thanks. 

She gets upset when he leaves and started following me inside the house calling me every insult you can imagine. For 3 hours she’s coming in and out the house cussing me out calling me everything and anything meanwhile her friends right outside listening. 

This eventually leads to me recording her and sending the recordings to my mom who immediately calls me to have me explain. As I’m doing this I try to do so while taking a bath to calm my nerves and get ready. My grandmother bursts into the bathroom while I’m naked yelling. I’m fed up. I calmly ask her to leave me alone let me be. She wants to persist. She hears my mom’s voice—she attacks. 

She puts me in a headlock and holds me in between her legs. Mind you at no point did I ever swing at her. I tried to leave the bathroom to get my clothes so I wouldn’t be standing there with her ass the fuck naked. This lead to violence and blood being drawn now she calls the cops and they come and see she made me bleed. They ask if I want to press charges. 

Everything in me screams yes. Imagine being a grandmother in jail. I should’ve put her ass there tbh. Maybe that would’ve set the tone moving forward but I didn’t. My mom told me not to. I listened. I move in with my uncle now. 

By now I felt awful for my daughter always being in chaos. I had to decide to give her to her dad. I wasn’t stable. No roof was calm. I gave her to who could support her best. Her father. 

I died. I died in 2020. 

2022 I met my recent ex. Everything was great the first two months until I realized we struggled horribly with finances and could never seem to get ourselves out of that hole unless we separated. Whenever I separated for him, my money flowed and stayed. I was eating. I was healthy. But then he would suffer and I would help because in my suffering he would help. We never let each other starve but this is also the same thing that kept us in a toxic cycle. Two incompatible broken unhealed angry people struggling trying to keep each other a float. Love was lost when it became physical. It started off verbal. He would say the craziest things to me and I would be taken aback like why are you being so mean? Who says things like that? I just think you really don’t like me honestly. But we would never split. 

I was always the one leaving. He would pursue. 

Basically this caused me to have one foot in the relationship door and one foot in my safety net (my home with my uncle) which was something I tried to manage while in a relationship with someone overly codependent. His codependency stemmed from insecurity. Mine came from a need to survive. So we clashed because we perceived each other different. I understood that change he didn’t. Me and this ex have had blow ups that resulted in him going to jail. All on his own. He brings the drama to my uncles front door. Always have. 

The reason for this is because we are both non relenting. I won’t back down when I don’t feel I’m wrong and he won’t either. I didn’t realize this until a few days ago when reflecting. We both will fight for what we believe which is great but also very detrimental and stupid. So here we are always fighting to the extreme because neither one of us can be wrong or hear the other person through. Once I realized this within myself as far as wanting to always be right, I started to tune in more to the fights. 

It wasn’t me. The person I was dealing with is just strange. Strange and bizarre. This is someone who believes they still have a right to sex after breakup because they offered to still come around and support you. No I don’t agree. We broke up 2 years ago in August. I have been talking and engaging with someone since November of 2023. 

Why wasn’t I going to the new person for help? Why was my ex still involved? He kept showing up. He kept forcing himself in front of me. He would do things like buy me food and text me if I was hungry he was down the street from my job. I would tell him no thanks and he would gas light me telling me stop being like that he already bought it to which I’d have to defend my stance and remind him I never asked for it. 

Now I’m a bitch because “I appreciate that but no thank you. I don’t want it. I didn’t ask for it. I told you I was fine and you did it anyway. Really you did it before I could even say yes or no. 

How am I at fault for the game you tried to pull and I caught it? 

The reason my ex is still around is because as I said above we both lost our jobs and had been trying to just help each other as much as possible however we could. We were suffering in the exact same space and place and didn’t want to involve anyone else as much as possible. 

I couldn’t figure it out in time however on my end and ended up really falling into the air of my family and he too. 

However things with my family have been going south even though I finally have a job. 
During my efforts to job hunt I liked to walk down the street to a coffee shop. I wouldn’t ask often for money to buy a coffee. But every now and then I would if I didn’t have it myself. This lead to my grandpa asking me to explain why I drink coffee and that he just wanted to understand. I knew it was some bullshit but I played his game anyway just to be told alright I understand and that was it. He ignored me the rest of the day. Never sent me $5 for a coffee. I was like see I knew you were gonna do that. 

I just ignored it and went home. I was more hurt that kind of game was played than upset. That was just foul to me to do. I open up to you and you listen just to do that at the end? It’s not about whether or not he sent it. It was about the game (I felt it was) he played (I felt he did) going about it. 

Again it was really about control. It was about keeping me in the house. They didn’t want me outside of the house so to prevent that they decided “I’ll just DoorDash you food. I’ll just buy you coffee to make at home (they go and buy decaf coffee grounds and I have a whole keurig. Had I wanted yall to go that route I would’ve asked for pods but I know pods are dummy expensive why would I ever ask for that in my state. The audacity. 

I asked for $5 maybe 2-3 times to buy a cup of coffee while I sit at these shop And job hunt. But apparently I’m wrong for doing so. I shouldn’t be asking. I shouldn’t be having pets. 

Because I can’t buy water I need to throw out my pets. My pets are cared for and have never been provided for by anyone outside of myself. Not even a single time during my drought did I ever ask anyone for money to provide for my pets. I managed that on my own. I would spend my money on their needs because I knew I could go longer without than they could. But they dont require much. 

But I’m being told to throw them out or be homeless. For what? Why do they need to be thrown out? I have a job. It pays in 2 weeks. My pets aren’t the problem. My uncle is telling you about them because he mad I have them. 

My mom resorts to calling me retarded and telling me to have the night I deserve. They make subtle threats about kicking me out at the end of August. And I’m at this point fed up entirely. 

No ones listening to me in full. She takes hits and pieces and runs a narrative but changes her perspective and stance when other people chime in with skewed bullshit and im literally trying to explain to her how really—everyone’s controlling and weird as shit and upset I’m not dumb enough to accept it so blatantly. 

Because I refuse and say certain things I’m difficult and problematic but I’m not. 

I wish I could go into more detail but I’m drained now. 

I just want to know what to do please.

So, I don't have any experience with hook-ups or dating apps. I met this guy on Bumble and we talked on call for 2 days - the conversation was easy, we were able to talk for more than 2 hours and he seemed like a decent dude. On the weekend, he invited me over to his place for coffee. I really love coffee and he had this premium coffee machine which I was curious about. He told me his flatmate (she's a girl) will be there, too and that after coffee, we could go to a bar and hangout. When I met him, he said ""Oh, I couldn't buy beer so let's get that"" I was a bit confused at first because weren't we going to a bar anyway? He told me he hadn't decided on a place yet so we could drink the store bought beer meanwhile. I did not feel comfortable and should've bolted but I decided to give him the benefit of doubt.

Back at his place, his flatmate was not present which instantly made me alert. He made coffee, we crashed on his couch watching a show. He then took out the beer. Once the show was over, I told him we could watch something else but he said something like ""let's talk"" or ""play some music"" and before I knew he was sniffing my hair, my neck etc and my entire body was stiff. I tried getting away but he just brushed off my concerns by telling me ""don't be shy"" and we started making out. I don't know what got into me - I did not want to do that at all but I felt 'obliged' and scared (he's much bigger than me) so I let it happen although my body was so stiff and rejecting everything. I thought maybe he would get a hint.

He told me he's a ""giver"" and he had planned on ""making me scream"" that night -- we had not discussed ANY of this before since the plan was to hangout at a bar. He wanted to take it further but I stopped him the moment he tried unbuttoning my jeans. I told him it's too soon for me, we just met and I can't do that. Then he kept asking me WHY I don't want to do that. And tried coercing me to go into his bedroom. I stood my ground and said no, but I knew he wasn't taking my word seriously because the way he talked made me realise that he still thought I would just give in. I quickly checked the train timings, told him I need to be home since I have to get up early the next day and left his place. I've been feeling so shitty about it. I cannot understand why I couldn't have just said NO. Even thinking about the fact that I let him kiss me makes me want to throw up. I also felt disrespected.


Oh, also I dressed up so cute since it was a 'date' and he showed up in sweatpants. He also talked down on my job. And I feel like I was catfished because he did not look anything like his pictures - he has long hair which looked good in pictures but it was so unkempt IRL.

1i6k9kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1i6k9kw/help_lowering_homocysteine/,Help Lowering Homocysteine ,"Hey all, i will provide as much info as I can in the hopes I can get some advice on how to get my homocysteine down.

* Hetero C677T, normal A1298C, hetero CBS C699T, hetero MTRR A66G
* Last year my homocysteine was 12.6 and in my most recent test this week is was 11.8
* I currently supplement with a methylated b-complex (see below for dosages) 500mg TMG, 3g creatine, and get my glycine from collagen in my coffee in the AM.
* I tested my b12 and folate and the levels came back as 635pg/ml for b12 and 18.5 pg/ml for folate
* Vitamin D levels were 66 ng/ml so good there
* I have eliminated all foods with synthetic folic acid

In terms of immediate measures, would you try adding another 500mg TMG so I am at 1G daily? Add more B12 to try and get my b12 levels up more?

I am concerned about the homocysteine level and want it under 10 at worst, 7-8 ideally...I thought for sure they would be much better than they are as my ocd and anxiety are pretty much completely gone since making the supplement changes above (the anxiety and ocd are what led me down the mthfr rabbit hole in the first place...)

u/tawinn Any other information I can provide, please let me know, thank you so much! I got most of what I am taking from your MTHFR supplement protocol...

So her method is Tea bag > hot water > milk > sugar > remove tea bag  (wet spoon in the sugar bowl though!)

I always do any dry things first, ie. Teabags or coffee, then sugar (with a dry spoon), add hot water, stir and then add milk stirring again.

This place where I live now is really into speaker meetings and birthday celebration meetings.  I am not into either one of those things.  And all the meetings and everyone who goes to them are into those things.  They love fancy cakes and they love to have someone get up and tell their life story to rooms-full of people.  I belonged to my original group for 15 years and we never, or hardly ever, did that stuff.  Here it is a weekly thing, if not more.

You wouldn't think this would be a problem but people don't think I work a very good program because I don't participate in these activities.  They don't like me to chair meetings, and they don't recommend me as a sponsor because of this.  Stuff like that.

I'm a very private person.  And I've always heard ""take what you need and leave the rest"".  I like sharing at meetings.  I like talking to people one-on-one.  I have no problem making coffee or setting up chairs. But I'm a quiet person who is content to stay in the background.  I think people are dicks who don't respect my preferences.   It kind of makes me not want to go, but I like having friends.  I just don't like jumping through the hoops that the more pushy types set up for other people.

When it's my birthday I'm good with saying my name is ... and I've had ... years, and they clap and then leave it at that.  I ain't into stuff like this and long speeches, etc.  I can see celebrating for newcomers, but a big party for every member, every year, complete with fliers, speeches, (and sometimes pizza, chili, etc, etc) and all the announcements running up to each and every celebration?

Me and a close friend attended an event where both of us were looking forward to attending. Afterwards we rested in a cafe over coffee. We chatted about many things, which we later chatted about a video game I was getting into at the time because of how I love the story and its characters. I then mentioned and described a particular character that was important to the game's story, even exclaimed how I slightly kinned or relate to the character where in the narration of the story was indirectly telling to the players this character was somewhat depressed, to which my friend said something along the lines of ""Damn, coffee can really make you overshare"".

I am self-aware that I tend to overshare, but I try to control myself depending on the situation and what I see as a mutual status of our relationship as friends. I often would just give hints whenever we learn a description of a character, saying things like ""Yeah, that's me!"" which they also do the same. Yet at that moment I felt vunerable, hurt, and self-conscious. I wasn't able to process everything until I arrived home and reflected what happened during that day, ultimately making me hating myself for oversharing to my friend when they didn't ask. I even didn't interact to them as much as I usually do during the week because: a) I wasn't mentally okay as I see myself as the problem, not them; and b) they were attending the event again at the end of the week, so I didn't want to ruin their excitement on going back with their other friends.

That moment left me to compare myself with their other friends that I would see them posting about in social media, feeling that our bond didn't established a safe space for both of us. It completely rewired my brain and how I view my relationships with other people with whatever I share them with. This person and I  are still close friends, but that moment felt somewhat traumatic that every now and then I would question myself if I'm still a valuable friend to them.",1,1737470076.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I'm a 27 year old English guy, moved here after living in fuerteventura for a year to be with my girlfriend and try something new.

I'm looking for new friends on the island - I have a nice group of Spanish mates from my girlfriend but it would also be nice to meet some others who are living here.

I enjoy some surfing (although not very experienced), muay thai, crossfit, coffee, exploring the island and practicing Spanish where possible.

Send me a message if you feel like hanging out some time!

1i6jqzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/1i6jqzh/where_can_i_buy_a_property_up_to_370k_in_a_safe/,Where can I buy a property (up to £370k) in a safe area in London or its outskirts?,"Hi everyone,

I’m an aspiring sole first-time buyer (dragging this out for years!) and feeling overwhelmed by the options, so I’d love your advice.
My budget can stretch to £370,000, but ideally, I’d like to stay as close to £300,000 as possible. I’m hoping for a two-bedroom with perhaps a small garden, though that’s not a must. A one-bedroom is fine too if it means a smaller or shorter mortgage.

Currently, I live in East Acton (Zone 2) and work in St John’s Wood/Swiss Cottage. Occasionally, I drive a company car for work, but I mostly rely on public transport. East Acton has been convenient because it’s on the Central Line before the branches split, with trains every 2–4 minutes. It has everything I need—a Lidl, gym, post office. It’s a boring station socially, but I’ve never seen antisocial behaviour, homeless people, or groups hanging around aimlessly. I’ve felt safe walking home (with very few exceptions in five years). Unfortunately, the area is too expensive for me.

I become increasingly concerned about the rise in robberies near tube stations, violence, and knife crime in London. A lot is happening around my work, and this is supposed to be a good area. This anxiety is draining—it’s awful always looking over my shoulder and clutching my bag like it’s worth something. Maybe it’s getting older  and aware of the reality/news or post-Covid antisocial tendencies, but I feel I need a change.

I’ve done some property viewings, both during the day and after work, but I’m getting more confused and less flexible with time. I’m afraid I won’t adapt any better in 5–10 years. I work a lot now to improve my mortgage potential, but I can’t sustain this pace. Plus, I barely have time for viewings. I feel the need to buy and move before my savings devalue further.

I’m not aiming for posh or pricey areas—just somewhere “normal” where families or single professionals live and feel safe walking home, even at night. Somewhere with a town-like feel, where I can recharge, plant my own herbs, hear the birds, go for a coffee or for a walk without rushing. I’d consider getting a car if it were practical, but definitely not for work due to ULEZ, the Congestion Charge, and no parking at my workplace. Public transport will remain my main option.
Here’s what I’m looking for:
* Public transport: My commute will mainly be by tube. I don’t mind taking a train for the last stretch if it’s frequent and gets me 5–10 minutes from Central London without breaking the bank. I don’t want to rely on buses, overground, or trams. I’m okay with being near the end of a tube line and having a longer journey—I always keep busy reading.

* Commute: A maximum of 1 hour door-to-door for work (I start work at 7 AM). I often go to Central London on weekends for the theatre, concerts, and pubs, though I’d like the option to stay local more as I get older, and leave the hustle and bustle to the youngers. I also need reliability—I can’t afford to be 30 minutes late for work because I missed a train.

* Proximity to stations: No more than a 5–10 minute walk to a tube or train station.

* Airports: I travel every other month, primarily from Gatwick and Luton, occasionally Heathrow, with Stansted as an option. I always use public transport and usually return on Sunday evenings. Taxis are not a sustainable option. 

* Budget: £300,000ish for a one-bedroom; up to £370,000 for a two-bedroom property.

I feel bombarded by hundreds of property alerts daily but don’t know how to filter for the right locations, decent leases, reasonable service charges, a short walk to the tube/train, and gas heating. I end up seeing the same properties repeatedly across various apps.

I’d really appreciate advice on specific areas or strategies for narrowing down my search.

So far, I don’t mind (but can’t find anything) in Greenford, Park Royal, North Acton (though I suspect something’s up, as lovely flats there seem to keep losing value), or East Acton (out of my budget).
Big no to Hanger Lane, Northolt, and Neasden.

Thank you so much!

""My journey ended on penacony trailblazers that's why I'll leave it all up to you. The discoveries of new worlds, The biggest reveals which will leave you in shock, The trailblazer's truth, Amphoreus Journey and so on. My time is up and I can't follow the other trailblazers anymore that's why I'm leaving my legacy here so maybe someone may read this and play this game wholeheartedly. Now let's begin the true farewell :

""Thank you trailblazer for being goofy and funny""

""Thank you march for always checking on us and also sharing one brain cell with the trailblazer""

""Thank you dan heng for making rational decisions and guiding us on what to do""

""Thank you himeko for watching us from the astral express  and making the greatest ""COFFEE"" I've ever seen""

""Thank you Mr. Yang for always taking care of us children whenever we went on a journey""

""Thank you PomPom for being the train's conductor and watching all of us when we're traveling through the stars"" 

""Thank you Sunday even though you're the newest member of the family. Thank you for being with us on this journey and changing yourself""



Lastly a mini fanfic from me imagining what happens when i give my farewell to each astral express member :

(For better experience imagine yourself as bidding farewell to them and imagine their voice in their dialogues) :

Trailblazer (caelus) :

You : I'm leaving 

Caelus : What? What do you mean?

You : i have to go

Caelus : Where?

You : I don't know

Caelus : Will you come back?

You : Probably not 

Caelus : are you really leaving us?

You : Yes i have no choice 

Caelus : (｡>﹏<)*smacks my head* Don't give me that 

You : Ow! What you do that for?

Caelus : Promise me you'll come back 

You : huh? But i may never come back. This is a journey where i can only go alone and i have to do this there is no other choice. I don't want to leave you but it hurts me a lot you know and als...

Caelus : (>﹏<) *smacks my head again* what is this emotional yapping (he would probably say this word). Keep it under 20 words or less. 

You : Ow!! Fine ok I'll try my best

""As we fistbump each other. I left and caelus said goodbye to me while holding his tears so i won't see it while saying these words in his head {Goodbye old friend}.""

Trailblazer (Stelle)

You : I'm leaving 

Stelle : Ok bye 

You : I'm leaving forever i may not return 

Stelle : Oh then take care. Safe travels 😚

You : wha... No goodbyes? No teary eyes?

Stelle : what did you expect for me to do? Crying and begging you to not leave us we will be so depressed and I don't want you to leave and blah blah blah blah blah 🗣️💥❗️❓🗣

You : how....wha.... Were you actually like this? Not even a thank you???? (˶˃⤙˂˶)

Stelle : you know what ok. Thanks for being my friend. Take care have a nice journey. Alright is that good???

You : At least something is better than nothing 

Stelle : Now go on before i start to regret whatever i said.

You : ok ok alright I'll go take care of others for me 

Stelle : Yeah whatever 

 *As i start to leave stelle calls me* 

Stelle : HEY!!!!!! *Throws something*

You : *catches it* a game?

Stelle : Yeah that's a memento for remembering me

You : I'll take care of it thank you ദ്ദി(ᵔᗜᵔ)

""{As i see stelle from far waving one last goodbye i can see that she is shaking and holding back tears for me to not feel sad and as i leave she start to burst out in tears and cries very much for me and hopes for one day for my return}""

Trailblazer (Dan heng)

You : I'm leaving 

Dan heng : .....

You : ..... What I'm leaving forever you know?

Dan heng : alright 

You : eh just like that no farewells for me?

Dan heng : why? I'm not like the others who'll cry and weep for you to stay and don't leave me

You : ah alright then take care of others for me 

Dan heng : sure. Safe travels 

Dan heng : Goodbye my friend 

""As i left i saw something inside my pocket""

You : huh... Wait no way is that???? (°ロ°)

{""As i recognize what it was i completely changed how i thought about dan heng my whole life as he gave me the most precious farewell gift i could ever ask for (A jade abacus)""}

Trailblazer (Himeko)

You : I'm leaving Miss himeko

Himeko : where to?

You : I don't know 

Himeko : Will you return?

You : maybe not

Himeko : can you take us with you?

You : i have to go alone

Himeko : I understand. Just be careful, okay? We may not see each other again, but you'll always be in our hearts

You : Can i have one last request?

Himeko : Go on?

You : Can i drink one last coffee of yours?

Himeko : Sure!

""As himeko goes to make coffee for me as i patiently wait for her""

Himeko : here you go

You : *Drinks it* It's still.... (¬_¬"")

Himeko : hmm?

You : The worst coffee I've ever drank 

Himeko *She starts to laugh* i was waiting for someone to say it but everyone just keeps drinking without saying anything 

You : huh!!! You knew?. Do you know how much we had to suffer for it??. 

{""As i start to laugh with her. We exchanged a couple more talks as we bid our farewells. In the quiet moments of the Astral Express, Himeko often found herself gazing out the window, lost in thoughts of . She'd smile sadly, sipping her coffee and wishing them a safe journey into the unknown.""}.

Trailblazer (Welt yang)

You : I'm leaving Mr. Yang

Welt : where to?

You : I don't know

Welt : can we come with you?

You : no you can't

Welt : Alright safe travels make sure to return safely 

You : i will not return mr. Yang this is farewell forever 

Welt : *He nods* I see… well, we’re on a journey as well, the Astral Express. If we happen to come across each other

You : we may never meet

Welt : There’s no such thing as ‘never.’ We’ll meet again sometime. I can bet on it.

You : That's kinda true

Welt : As you can see, this train travels across the universe. If fate desires for us to meet again, we won’t be separated for so long. Afterall, fate always has a funny way of bringing people together, don’t you think?”

You "" *i chuckled a bit* you're like a book Mr. Yang (  ≧ᗜ≦)

Welt : Well great wisdom have immense boredom. You younglings won't get it

You : You're not old Mr. Yang you still look young to be honest 

Welt : thank you for the compliment 

You : Well then Mr. Yang take care of yourself and others for me 

Welt :  farewell trailblazer! Fate will let us meet again 

{As i leave Welt sees in the sky thinking about his world where he had to also part ways with others but it is the will of others that let's you move forward with their feelings and expectations inside you}.

 Trailblazer PomPom (The conductor)

You : I'm leaving 

PomPom : huh why?

You : because I'm going on a journey 

PomPom : wait you will come back right?

You : probably not

PomPom : *tears up* don't leave us

Pompom : Goodbye trailblazer and here's a farewell gift

You : it's a keychain with the astral express on it

Pompom : To remember us

You : *starts to cry* thank you pompom *hugs pompom* thanks for everything

{As i leave pompom cries very much as others come to comfort pompom. Pompom always thinks in free time what are the other trailblazers doing. Are they alive?. Are they Happy?. Are they eating well?.}

Trailblazer (Sunday)

You : I'm leaving 

Sunday : hmm? Where to?

You : I don't know

Sunday : Do you need us to come?

You : No i have to go alone

Sunday : is that so? Then will you return?

Wait.

*Gives you Something*

You : What is this?

Sunday : it's a copy of one of the robin's songs. Whenever you're in distress or you seem to be in trouble it will keep you calm.

You : *i laugh a little* You sure do love your sister don't you?

Sunday : If by any chance you meet robin in your journey. Check to see if she's alright

As a child, I frequently had severe migraines with aura, along with symptoms like visual hallucinations, confusion, paralysis on one side of my body, numbness, tingling, and intense pain. This resulted in multiple emergency room visits & these migraines occurred about once or twice a month for a couple of years, but the exact timeline is unclear.

Im not sure if the migraines actually have contributed to my chronic brain fog, but I’ve heard that brain fog is more common in people who experience migraines, so maybe there is a correlation. I also think its possible one of my migraines might’ve actually been a transient ischemic attack, but im not sure if theres any way to know for sure. 

I currently take lion’s mane mushrooms, which I believe have been helpful, but I still don’t feel like I did before the brain fog set in. Also I think My diet is pretty good—I drink only water, black coffee, and green tea, and I don’t eat heavily processed foods. I also go to the gym regularly and stay well-hydrated. I am now 18, so it has been 6 years of having chronic brain fog.

And people are trying to distract me by talking to me and I tell them it won't work, you can't distract me but they're trained to try different things and none of them work on me. And all it does is adds to the sensory overload and the one nurse is trying to keep me calm by rubbing my arm or back and That Hurts! And she'll stop when I mention it, but I don't think she realized what she was doing because she'd start back up again. So I have overload from the horrid music, overload from the chatter, my skin hurts from being rubbed, and now my arm hurts from getting stuck by the needle. And it's -7* when I got up this morning, so yay for that, too. 

But at least hugging my coffee mug disguised the T-Rex Arms?? I'm exhausted now and have to go to work. Yay me. What horrible morning. ",2,1737469514.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

Before my dog passed away, I took him everywhere-- to outdoor cafés, the park, to my parents' house, on hiking trails...

Yes, there were places (like the grocery) that were off limits, but as long as it was outside in the fresh air, we really went everywhere together.

I'm sad that I can't take my kitty with me to visit family, for example. If I want to write poetry outside at a coffee place, she has to stay home.

Some cats can be leash trained, but my Lola is agoraphobic due to trauma from her previous home. She can't even really ride in cars. She pooped herself, when I first picked her up to adopt her, out of fear. :(

Shes the perfect cat for my lifestyle, though, really. She not needy, she prefers her alone time, she almost intuitively seems to know what I want from her. I'm glad she's happy being a homebody, but I still miss her when I'm out and about.

I adopted her 4 months ago, and at the time we weren't sure if we liked eachother, but now we're attached to the hip whenever we're home. We grew on eachother so quickly. :)",2,1737469328.0,cats,0,1.0,False

Looking to create a cozy yet contemporary vibe in your living room? The modern rustic style blends the best of both worlds, combining natural elements with sleek, modern aesthetics. 

Whether you’re updating your entire space or adding a few touches, these modern rustic living room ideas will inspire you to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.

Start with a neutral color palette featuring earthy tones like browns, creams, and grays. Layer in textures with materials such as reclaimed wood, stone accents, and soft textiles like wool or linen. A statement piece, like a rustic coffee table or a wooden beam mantel, can anchor the room and add that rustic charm.

To balance the rustic elements, incorporate modern touches with sleek furniture, minimalist lighting, and contemporary art. A plush sofa with clean lines pairs beautifully with a rugged wooden floor, while metallic accents like brushed gold or matte black add a touch of elegance.

For more inspiration and to see how you can blend these elements effortlessly, check out the pin below!

My entire adult life I’ve wanted a relationship. I feel no shame in that and it makes a lot of sense considering all I could see around me are my straight friends getting into and out of relationships. It was extremely isolating to experience such loneliness as a young gay guy and it seems to be something that pervades the gay community by enlarge.

The r/gaybros subreddit has daily posts about feeling lonely and desiring companionship to the degree that it’s almost a meme. People lament over how superficial, small, and negative the gay community is. I grew up with the notion more and more that life would just be easier if I was straight— it’s clear that is not the case— and that metastasized into toxic resentment. On a bad day, I’d see couples being loving towards each other and just glare at them. It could send me into a panic attack. A relationship constantly seemed to elude me despite my best efforts and it hurt a lot and my world seemed so small despite actually being bigger than ever with dating apps, which didn’t exist for the convenience of gay guys for centuries. 

I moved to a new country, I put a lot of effort into dating, and found it exhausted me. I finally found someone I really liked (by accident) and he couldn’t commit. I asked out a guy at a coffee shop, got too excited, later found out it was a miscommunication and he’s straight and he thought I was being friendly. And that was when I just lost it. 

It was so difficult to make sense of things. Everything else in my life yielded results when I take action. I want to be better at Spanish? I practice everyday and can earn certificates certifying my fluency. I want to be more fit? I go to the gym and after a year, I’m told by people how good I look. Want friends? I’m extremely socially capable of that and do it easily. There will always be someone somewhere willing to extend an olive branch. But you can go on dates for months and it yields nothing special. It’s chance. 

So I have already spent many years (18-23) feeling incomplete and sad, chasing men that are not good for me, being addicted to hookups, and I have to turn things around and let go. I get to choose to be happy now, not when I get a partner. There are people that don’t have half the opportunities I do in life. I wake up without chronic pain, my country isn’t being bombed, and my house is safe and warm. I can take our transit system anywhere and see anything I want. Sick of living life like mine is limited and curbed just because I don't have a partner. ",5,1737469219.0,SingleAndHappy,3,0.78,False

A bit about me: I’m on the west coast, love staying active, and spend my time working out, hiking, growing houseplants, and playing sports. I’m into documentaries, true crime, movies, and, yeah, reality TV (it’s my guilty pleasure). I also love being outside whenever I can whether it’s sitting in the beach, hiking, or walking downtown for a coffee on the weekend. 

I’m just looking for someone chill to talk to, someone who doesn’t take life too seriously, likes to laugh, and can chat about whatever they’re into. We could keep each other motivated, vent about rough days, or just make things a little less boring.

F43, 5FT 3, 63KGS 

sertraline 50mgs, propranolol extended release 80mgs, levothyroxine 25mgs, cetirizine (don't know the dose but once or twice daily), HRT - progesterone and oestrogen 

Supplements iron spray, vitamin D and K spray and the coq10

POTS / ME / CFS / MCAS / known bigimeny and trigimeny and short NSVT runs. 

Structurally normal echo and normal stress test summer 2023 and normal MRI summer 2019. 


Im a bit concerned because I've just had the longest run of NSVT I've ever had, it was about 5 or 6 beats when the longest I've had was 3. 

I'm pretty sure it was NSVT and not SVT due to the way it felt and it felt the same as my NSVT that's been captured on recording before but obviously I can't be certain. 

Sudden onset and sudden offset with a few single skipped beats in the minutes after (which makes me think it's even more likely to be NSVT). Felt like a fluttering in my heart. 

I started coq10 enzyme (100mgs coq10 and 0.17mgs thiamine) about 4 days ago because I have been sleeping through the day alot and feeling exhausted. Though I did skip today's dose as I was out. 

And the last few days I've had more energy than I have in months. 

Today I had a whole day where I didn't need to sleep at all but this evening I have been feeling like I have too much energy (wired) and feel hot and a bit like I'm on fire and like I can't settle down. It's 2am and I'm nowhere near sleep. I have felt like my heart is beating faster and more strongly since I started on the coq10. I feel basically like I've had a coffee but I avoid caffeine so don't. 

So yeah I was just laying on my back in bed and it came on. 

I'm wondering if it could be being caused by the coq10 enzyme or related to an interaction with any tablets or supplements I'm taking. 

I do have a history of increased skipped beats with alot of tablets including vitamin D and magnesium especially and that's why we started me on a baby dose of levothyroxine but I've only ever had NSVT 3 times I'm aware of including this one 😬

Before I go running to my cardiologist and bothering him I just wanted people's thoughts on coq10 as a possible cause. 

Long term monitoring except a loop recorder would be pointless as luckily these events so rarely happen but I am concerned that each time I have had one it's increased in length and Im wondering if that's a reason alone to see my cardiologist. 

I will obviously stop the coq10 but would it even be still in my system if I last had it 33 hours prior to me having this run of beats now. 

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated as I don't want to run to my cardiologist if it's not necessary.

You’ve been grinding all day (or maybe all night). Whether you’re writing copy, designing logos, managing campaigns, coding until your eyes hurt, or juggling a million client deadlines, one thing’s for sure: when it’s finally time to relax, you want to **chill hard.**

But here’s the problem—your “relaxation time” probably looks something like this:

* Flipping through cable channels only to find *literally nothing good*.
* Wasting time scrolling through five different streaming platforms.
* Dealing with buffering or low-quality streams from sketchy sites.
* Watching the same old shows because *everything else is paywalled.*

As a freelancer, you already deal with enough stress. So, let me introduce you to your new favorite post-work companion: **IPTV.**

# 🎯 Why IPTV is the Perfect Fit for Freelancers

# 1️⃣ Endless Options = No More Decision Fatigue

Freelancers make *a lot* of decisions. Which projects to take, how much to charge, how to respond to Karen’s 12th email of the day... Your brain is DONE by the time you’re ready to unwind.

That’s why IPTV is perfect—it gives you **instant access to thousands of live channels, movies, and shows.** No more wasting time scrolling, searching, or deciding which app to open. Just turn it on and go.

Platforms like [**IPTVGREAT**](http://iptvgreat.xyz) and [**IPTVFOLLOW**](http://iptvfollow.com) make it easy to find exactly what you’re in the mood for:

* Want to binge your favorite series? Done.
* Catch up on live sports? Easy.
* Explore niche international channels at 2 AM? Why not?

It’s all there, one click away.

# 2️⃣ Work Anywhere, Watch Anywhere

As a freelancer, your workspace could be anywhere:

* Your home office.
* A coffee shop.
* A co-working space.
* Even your car during client calls (no judgment).

IPTV works the same way—**it goes wherever you go.** Whether you’re on your laptop, tablet, phone, or Smart TV, services like [**IPTVUNLOCK**](http://iptvunlock.com) and [**IPTVGEAR**](http://iptvgear.org) make it ridiculously easy to stream on the go.

So whether you’re taking a quick break between Zoom calls or kicking back after finishing a big project, your favorite content is always within reach.

# 3️⃣ Affordable AF (Because Let’s Be Real, Freelancing Can Be Tight)

Freelancers know the struggle: some months are great, and others... well, not so much. The last thing you need is another expensive subscription eating into your budget.

That’s why IPTV is a **game-changer.**

* Instead of paying $100+ for cable or juggling multiple streaming subscriptions, IPTV gives you **everything for $10–$30 a month.**
* No hidden fees, no contracts, no stress.

With services like [**IPTVTOPS**](http://iptvtops.com) and [**IPTVRESALE**](http://iptvresale.com), you can watch live TV, movies, sports, and international content for *less than what you spend on coffee for the week.*

# 4️⃣ Late-Night Streaming Without the Guilt

Freelancers don’t have 9-to-5s. Sometimes, your workday starts at midnight, and your “downtime” doesn’t kick in until the rest of the world is asleep.

IPTV is built for those off-peak hours. Services like [**IPTVGANG**](http://iptvgang.me) and [**IPTVFOLLOW**](http://iptvfollow.com) let you stream **24/7** with:

* On-demand movies and shows (watch what you want, when you want).
* International content that matches your weird working hours.
* Zero interruptions from ads or pop-ups.

So whether you’re taking a well-earned break at 3 AM or procrastinating on that next client project, IPTV has your back.

# 5️⃣ The Perfect Escape After a Stressful Day

Freelancing is awesome, but let’s not lie—it can also be a lot. Chasing invoices, managing deadlines, and dealing with impossible client requests? You deserve to escape for a bit.

That’s where IPTV comes in:

* **Love sports?** Watch every game, match, or event—live and in HD. (No blackouts, ever.)
* **Into movies?** Access everything from blockbusters to indie flicks, even the ones still in theaters.
* **Need background noise?** Flip through thousands of live channels and let the vibe set itself.

Platforms like [**IPTVGREAT**](http://iptvgreat.xyz) and [**IPTVGEAR**](http://iptvgear.org) let you turn your brain off and just enjoy.
