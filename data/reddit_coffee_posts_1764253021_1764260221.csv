**ENGLISH**  


Hey men of Haarlem and the surrounding area,

My name is Wiebe Teeuwen (Coach & Psychosocial Therapist). After years of corporate success, a severe burnout led me to discover depression and a struggle with alcohol and cocaine addiction.

My path to recovery began with the courageous step of **learning to listen to my emotions again**. Now, I’m using my professional background (Psychology degree) and my personal journey to launch a **free** men's group in Haarlem to help you find your own liberation.

**What We Do**

1. This is a safe, non-judgmental space for men (aged 16 and up) who are looking for:
2. **Emotional Literacy:** Learning to feel, process, and healthily express emotions.
3. **Genuine Connection:** Building deep, authentic contact with other men, without the usual masks.
4. **Self-Discovery:** Who are you, truly, beyond your job title or achievements?
5. **Deconstruction:** We critically discuss and challenge the harmful pressures society places on men (patriarchy, toxic masculinity ideals).

💡 **Intergenerational Power:** The group is open to men **aged 16 and older**. We believe young and old can learn from each other's life experiences and support one another in the process of self-liberation.

# Our Core Rules

We operate based on **non-judgment, active listening, and complete respect**. Racism, discrimination, and sexism are strictly not allowed.

I want some way of detecting either the low level of coffee in the pot combined with the burner being on, or detecting an overheating situation.

Maybe a thermal imaging camera? I think those are big bucks...

Buenos Aires is a beautiful city of wide avenues, striking architecture and a population that has come to terms with the fact that the peso has been in freefall for decades and banks can't be trusted. The economy is feral. Enter crypto.

Devconnect 2025, the World's Fair for Ethereum, will be (or has been, by the time you are reading this) held in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

>Argentina is a place where Ethereum adoption is happening *right now*. People are using stablecoins and blockchain solutions for daily transactions and savings.

Like many people interested in the culture of Ethereum, I have only scratched the surface of Decentralized Finance. DeFi, ranging from yield-bearing accounts to leverage trading to penguin NFTs. Ethereum, I'm told, is digital oil, the beginnings of a system that will change the way we interact with finance the way that the Internet has changed the way we interact with the world.

It sounds amazing and futuristic: a sci-fi utopia. But right here, right now, the Ethereum Foundation says that people in Buenos Aires are using these solutions to buy coffee and bread and maybe a little salvation.

Could I do that, too? Could I buy asado and wine with stablecoins? Toilet paper?

I decide that I need to find out. I'll fly to Argentina and see if I could live on-chain, converting my carefully hoarded store of half an ETH to USDC.

There's three parts to this. Decentralized: No single entity is in control. Permissionless: I cannot be denied access. Trustless: I don't need to have faith that the transaction will happen.

How close can I get to that dream of the future of finance of walking the sunlit streets with nothing but a digital wallet and my own hunger?

I call the challenge *Decentralized or Destitute*.

I pack a backpack with three T-shirts, one pair of jeans and a cheap phone to hold a burner wallet.  Also two debit cards, one credit card and an envelope full of cash. Because I am not brave and I've seen what happens to idealists in documentaries.

Step one: get a place to sleep using crypto.

Booking an apartment directly with a private owner fails immediately. The first person I contact rejects the offer without consideration. *""No cripto.""* Dollar, Euros or Pesos, but absolutely cash only. The second not only doesn't want crypto but doesn't want my business at all, just for asking.

I'm going to have to use one of the travel platforms that offer this specifically.

Unfortunately, the great savings of up to 60% off for paying with crypto are based on booking hotels of a slightly higher quality than I usually stay at. One excitedly tells me about the perfect place for me! And it's 44% off! Making for a very affordable $619.50 per night with 2% cashback. There seem to be very few options at my actual price range, which is more like $40 a night. Preferably with walls.

Betrustly, a brand new booking platform designed for Argentina, gives me hope. I find a perfect room in a large co-living house: private bathroom, working areas, fantastic price and available for the dates I wanted. Except that I never receive a response. Customer support's advice is to book the place directly. They quickly reply to my direct contact: application only, the minimum stay is one month, and no, they do not take crypto.

The Ether.fi travel portal finally gives me a  break: a private room that actually exists, well-placed, well-priced.

But when they say you can pay in crypto, they don't mean that you can pay in crypto. You have to have an Ether.fi card for that perk. Fine, I apply for  the card. No. People who live in my country are not invited to the party.

Desperate for a solution, I cave and pay with a DeFi card: it's Gnosis Pay, which is self-custodial (they can't lock me out of my finds) and allows me to pay for my hostel booking with stablecoins. Technically a win.  But Gnosis Pay is a *Visa card*. A literal, physical card indistinguishable from the one issued by my bank. It feels like I won using training wheels and corporate logos.

Friends and family express only minor concern at my plan. My best friend worries I'll get indoctrinated into a crypto cult. (Plausible.) My mother thinks that I might be in over my head. (Correct.) My aunt is concerned that I might have fallen for a romance scam. (Incorrect, but my DMs are open.)

But to my surprise, the most urgent concerns for my safety come from a nurse at the Center for Infectious Diseases.

There are no vaccine requirements for Argentina, but my doctor still advises a vist to the infectious disease clinic. I'm an immigrant in a European country where my language skills are somewhere between lost tourist and toddler, which makes this sort of appointment nervewracking. At the front desk, the receptionist asks at full volume what infectious disease I was being treated for and then waves me upstairs to meet with a nurse.

I explain to the nurse that I don't speak the local language. She disagrees, pointing out that I'd just said I don't speak the language in the language. Fine. I haltingly explain that I am going to  Argentina and sit back, my vocabulary expended.

She pulls up a browser with the website for the US Government Center for Disease Control and Prevention already loaded and scans the English-language page on Argentina before helpfully translating the key points for me into the language I just said that I didn't speak.

""Do you know typhoid?"" she asks.

""A little,"" I say, as if we'd met at a party once.

She rattles off instructions: don't drink the water, don't open my mouth while in the shower, disinfect my hands every time I wash them, don't eat \[unintelligible\]. I ask her repeat it. She says a word that I do not understand.

She pauses, rephrases and then, finally acknowledging my lack of fluency, switches to English. ""Don't eat salads.""

Um, ok. ""Steak?"" I ask, grinning.

""Yes. Eat steak."" She is not smiling.

She shifts back to the local language to tell me we are definitely vaccinating me against yellow fever and hepatitis A. My consent is apparently not required.

Then she gives me a long lecture about rabies in Argentina, but there are too many words I don't recognize.

She goes back to English with a sigh. If I get bitten by a dog or a monkey, I must go straight to the hospital.

I nod to let her know that I am taking her advice seriously, while wondering how likely it is that I will be bitten by a monkey attending an Ethereum conference in Buenos Aires and also, how is it that the nurse knows the English word for “monkey” but not the word for “uncooked food”?

That's enough English, apparently. She quizzes me on my intentions. What am I doing there? Would I be with other people?

Buenos Aires has a population of 16 million, so I am unlikely to be alone. But maybe this is a euphemistic phrase and she is working up to a talk on sexually transmitted diseases of Latin America. I admit yet again that I don't understand.

“Are you travelling alone?”

“Yes.”

She asks me another question where I understood only two words: pleasure and risk.

I blink at her in obvious confusion and she takes pity on me.

“Do you like risk?”

I bite my lip. It seems like a bad idea to admit to being a risk junkie in the Centre for Infectious Diseases.

“No?”

“Good!” She thinks for a moment and comes to a decision. “I think we will also give you the rabies shot.”

With that, she pulls out a syringe. Apparently, the time for discussion is over.

House plants. As a child, I didn’t understand the appeal. Why do you want outside inside? There’s bits of dirt on the coffee table, there’s yellow water, soil, fertilization stains on the tray the plant pot sits in. It’s work. Taking care of them is just extra chores. The first house plant I can remember is a type of vine from my grandpa’s house, we called him Dad. It lived on the coffee table, it was taped to the wall. Taped. It grew so long and climbed up the side of the window frame that was located beside his blue corduroy recliner that faced the RCA tube TV. To his right, a window. He could see the playground, the neighboring townhouses, a concrete pathway that snaked between the buildings which the mailman used to navigate. “Ok my boy, the mail is here, how fast do you think you can get it? I’ll time you.” Vroom, out the door I go, bolting to the mailbox, hopping over the yellow speed bumps, stepping on curbs and jumping over garden beds, or more likely landing in them, brown sod flicking up, stomping on the outdoor plants, hya! suck it cedar shrub, and I’d arrive at the mailbox. Long rectangular vertical rows of faded gold with tight lines running down the face that would make zig zag sounds if you ran the key across it in a perpendicular fashion, the keyhole on the upper right hand side, door hinges on left side, door swinging right. Zip, click, open, grab the goods, flyers bundled together with elastic bands, letters, bills, slam, click, zip, turn and burn baby, same fashion on my way back, sprinting like my life depended on it, down the little sidewalk hill towards the front door. I burst through the entrance. “Stop!! How long did it take me?” Startled “Oh! That was 3 minutes” likely a made up number based off the reaction he’d make sometimes, as though he forgot about my mission. “Did you actually keep time, or did you make that up?” “I did, you calling me a liar? You’re really fast my boy” little bit of gaslighting while building my confidence and keeping the peace. Out of breath, panting, “K, now what?” I think to myself. “Dad, can we go down to London Drugs and get some Smarties?” A little Canadian treat, similar to plain M&Ms but better, “Not right now, my boy, I’m reading my flyers. Why don’t you go and see if Riley’s home. See if he wants to play with you.” “Awh! Ok.” Back out the door I went, thinking “I hope Riley answers the door.” I hated when Mark, his stepdad answered the door, he was this mean old white man who always rode a loud motorcycle. I also hated when his older sister Ashley answered, she thought I was cute, and would always make a remark. My parents knew she thought I was cute and they’d always tease me about her, calling her my girlfriend. I didn’t like that. ",1,1764259041.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

P.s I used cricket as the parr iv never played it you look like you have but more than likely I'd still beat you at it.

1p85hy1,https://i.redd.it/3t161rsmmt3g1.jpeg,My all signed collection and vinyl collecting journey!,"Hey yall, I wanted to make this post to show my current vinyl collection and talk about my collecting journey. I don’t have anyone irl to geek out about this with so I figured why not here lol. It’s a bit of a read, just a heads up!

I’ve wanted to collect vinyl records for as long as I can remember. I love being able to own a physical piece of media and admire the artwork. But I knew very well that if I began collecting, it would become a very expensive hobby. And with how many albums I love and would want to own on vinyl, I knew it wouldn’t be long before my purchases would add up. So I chose to admire them from a distance. But I loved the idea of participating in record drops or waiting after a show to get a sleeve signed by an artist, it seemed like so much fun. 

Still, I decided against beginning a collection, that is, until I found out that Clipse would be selling a signed version of their latest record LET GOD SORT EM OUT for only $30. To own a signed vinyl of the (probably lol) best rap album of the year for such a low price seemed like a no brainer to me. And fortunately enough, I was already going to that show! I became determined to get one of those signed records, and as you can see from above, I was successful. 

From there, I would have loved to run to Target and raid the aisle that holds all the classics to begin expanding my collection, but I wanted to grow my collection in a healthy way. Without draining my wallet. 

So, I created some guidelines for myself when purchasing a record, I TRY to only get them at shows, if it’s signed (or if I know very well I can get it signed), and if I actually like the album. Emphasis on try, the Serj signed System of a Down self titled record I actually managed to pick up at his coffee shop in Glendale. But for $70, I felt it was well worth the price. I also happened to pick up a signed copy of Not For Radios Melt for only $30 on their website. You can see how quickly this would have spiraled had I not given myself a few rules to follow lol. 

I bought that Clipse vinyl in September, and wrapping up November I now have 6 records in my collection, all signed! (The Not for Radio one has to ship.) Getting records signed after shows or even purchasing them signed has saved me a lot of money, and has led me to building a small collection of records to call my own that I’m happy with. My next purchase should definitely be to get some protective sleeves. Thank you for reading! 

The vinyl shown are 

LET GOD SORT EM OUT -Clipse
Alfredo 2 -Freddie Gibbs & The Alchemist 
Why Lawd? -Anderson Paak & Knxwledge (NxWorries)
Imaginal Disk -Magdalena Bay
System of a Down -System of a Down
God Does Like Ugly -JID

Ps. Any idea of what the value of my collection or individual records could be? I have absolutely no intention of selling them but I’m just curious and am still getting use to using Discogs. I just know that a lot plays into the value such as the color of the record itself and alternate covers and what not. Thank you!",13,1764258606.0,vinyl,0,0.93,False

1p85a29,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p85a29/ro_we_met_on_omegle/,[RO] We Met on Omegle.,"We met on *Omegle* \- of all absurd places for something real to begin.

 

She was from Israel, pursuing psychology. I was from India, hauling business and philosophy in equal measure. Somehow our conversations stretched from ten minutes to three hours without either of us noticing.

 

We debated paradoxes, consciousness, free will, attachment.

I teased her sometimes - subtle, dry flirting just to make her laugh.

But we both knew exactly what it was:

 

**Platonic. Safe. Comfortable.**

 

Two people who loved thinking more than they loved people.

 

And then one morning, comfort collapsed.

 

**NEWS: ISRAEL BOMBARDED. CIVILIANS EVACUATING.**

 

I didn’t feel shock.

*I felt silence, the kind that forms when someone important suddenly goes missing from the world.*

 

I tried calling her everywhere.

Instagram. WhatsApp. Telegram.

**200 calls. Literally.**

Not one answer.

 

 

Three days later, my phone rang - unregistered number.

 

A breath, cracked like broken glass:

“Pat....rick?”

 

She didn’t need to introduce herself.

 

She told me everything in pieces -

house gone, friends dead, university dust, nights in refugee basements.

She was hesitant to share more, but I insisted.

No bank account access, no money, no home, and no one left.

And she broke down.

 

She didn’t want to live.

she wanted a reason to try.

 

I wanted to feel emotional,  
but convinced myself this wasn't the right time.   
Someone had trusted me enough to reach out in their lowest moments.

I had to do something.

 

She was hesitant when I suggested Jordan.

Terrified when I suggested moving to India.

And why wouldn’t she be?

A girl alone, in war, being asked to cross borders based on trust. 

 

 

I didn’t push.

I told her the truth - raw, unpolished, unpoetic:

 

“Look, okay. Um.. Lisa.  
Stop crying for a minute. You...you don't have anywhere to go.  
You know that.

You have to trust me.  
Do you....do you trust me?”

 

She didn’t agree immediately.

She only cried.

*But tears are sometimes the first yes of survival.*



\-x- 



Eleven days later she had a visa.

Thirteen days later she walked out of Delhi Airport.

I recognized her instantly - not through features, not through clothes - but through exhaustion.

 

She stopped exactly ten feet away -

like her body wanted to run to me but her mind begged caution.

*Her eyes already full, glassy, breaking.*

 

And then she ran.

 

The hug wasn’t soft.

**It was desperate, trembling, like she was trying to press her spine into mine. Like she was holding onto the only unbombed place left in her life.**

Five minutes thirty seconds - I counted in my breath.

   
\-x- 

 

At the hotel I was deliberate - painfully deliberate.

I sat at the far end of the room, never between her and the door.

Never looked while she slept.

Never touched without reason.

 

*Care is only care when consent breathes freely.*

 

I was so deliberate, it probably looked like I hated her.

Was I being respectful or just cold?

I had no idea, but I wasn't going to risk making her feel indebted.

 

She showered the next morning, and changed into an oversized green hoodie.

Wet hair, flip-flops slightly loose, eyes calmer.

She ate quietly, voice smaller than before.

Trauma shrinks volume.

  
\-x-

 

And then - marriage.

 

I explained everything:

that marriage gave her immediate residency, citizenship within months, and after one year she could divorce me - and still stay safe.

But:

We couldn’t marry in court - she wasn’t a citizen.

Christian marriage required a kiss - unnecessary pressure.

Hindu ceremony was minimal, respectful, witness-based.

 

*Legal first, emotional later - if later ever came.*

 

 

She took hours alone before saying:

 

**“I think I trust you.”**  
  
*And trust is marriage enough in war.*

  
\-x-

 

The wedding was simple - two marigold garlands, a priest, a Sanskrit chant that didn’t ask love, only presence.

She had that. I had that.

  
\-x- 



We returned to Kolkata, my native place.

 

I told her she couldn't come home immediately - not without preparing my family.

*My parents, of course, were shock personified.*

They yelled at me.  
I wanted to yell back at them, for not noticing the helplessness in her eyes.

But I didn't.

 

Acceptance took time - but time is strangely obedient when kindness is consistent.

   
We shared a room.   
But not a bed. 

For three months, I slept on the floor beside the bed.

Not because I was obligated - but because I didn’t want proximity to feel like debt.

 

One night, exhaustion won.

She insisted I sleep on the bed - “just because it’s warmer.”

So we slept - backs turned, breath separate, respect in the middle like a wall.

  

Then it happened.

 

I woke to a hand on my chest - gentle, uncertain, but wanting safety.

She hadn’t realized I woke.

And maybe she didn’t intend to touch -

*but trauma trusts in sleep before waking life.*

 

The next night, again, this time deliberate. 



The following night, she whispered into my shoulder cavity,  
thinking I was asleep:

 

**""I don’t know what I would’ve done without you. I don't want to know.”**

 

I didn’t move.

Didn’t speak.

Just memorized the sound and swallowed the moment whole.

 

The following morning, coffee breath, kitchen silence.

 

I walked up behind her, placed my lips on the back of her head and said: 

**“Love you too.”**

and walked out casually, as if what I just said was as natural as breathing.

 

\-x- 

 

One year passed.

She never mentioned divorce.

Neither did I.

 

*Because love sometimes grows the way nations recover,*

*slowly, painfully, and then all at once.*

 

And out of all things, what I found absurd was the fact that we met on Omegle.",1,1764258076.0,shortstories,1,0.67,False

SM out of town. Scheduled two people. Me, barista of three months(the only one in town rn who CAN open, but normally outside my availability and I am an insomniac) and the SSV. It was dead for a minute which was fine. But then we got slammed. Normally between 7 and 9 we have at least three, maybe four people. Again, we have two. For a holiday. So when the rush hits it's bad enough without customers being Customers.

Oh you wanted those four venti chai lattes iced? And you waited till I'm almost done with all four to tell me? Steamed milk already in 3/4 cups(all the exact same so I tried to batch them) so I can't just pour the chai into a new cup and add a pump. Acted like she said iced and it didnt get put in but I heard her order and I didn't hear ""iced"".

Oh the couple in front of you took at least three whole minutes to order, but you couldn't be bothered to figure out what the hell you want before you step up to my counter? It was like their consciousness suddenly spawned in. Line behind them btw. Proceeds to hold it up even longer. I'm standing there like an idiot, SSV taking over bar for a minute, because people keep starting their orders and then spending forever making up their mind part way through and I'm not stepping away bc the second I do they'll have the answer and I'm already pissed off so I'm not tempting fate. I was barely keeping my shit together as it was.

Oh you placed a 7 item mobile order, came in two minutes later to watch me make it, but you're so sorry I have to work Thanksgiving? I think if one more customer pulled the fake guilty thing to try to get a laugh out of me I was going to jump across the counter. Ive already accepted that youre here and I'm clocked in. Your fake apology to soothe your own guilt because you KNOW people like you are why we are open just... pisses me off. I'd much rather you pretend like it's a normal ass day, I promise you. Except to the old guy who tipped $5 on a single vertica coffee. I'll give you a pass because you bothered to tip on the holiday, at least, in some attempt to compensate, which at least feels more genuine.

The deliveries? Insane. So we have to have the store open so there are already people working, but god forbid you get in your car and drive here so lets have a doordasher deal with it. I wasnt getting the impression from the drivers' vibes that they were getting tipped well, either.

SSV said we did really well considering our coverage and that I did really well manning bar despite being here only three months(he thought it was six, the compliment was about the only enjoyable aspect of today at all).

1p859oh,https://i.redd.it/jciv5sfzkt3g1.jpeg,This is why we do all this,"
I don’t care for Christmas (grew up a pastors kid, so it basically means working the whole month for events and parties for everyone else, then being exhausted with your family) but my wife loves it.  I found some fun in collecting a nutcracker or something called räuchermann (little German incense smokers) we collect - but otherwise I’d put up a tiny tree and just get through the month. 

Since having foster kids and our son, I still don’t enjoy Christmas BUT I love watching the kids, and now my son absorbed in the Christmas “magic”.  I woke up this morning and he wanted to go to the tree - and just played with the ornaments and sang for an hour while I drank coffee.  Completely content and happy. And that makes me happy. 

No huge point to this point other than when people ask “does it get better” or “when does it stop being hard” - this is a trade off. They can make things you don’t think are great , great.  Enjoy the moments, enjoy thanksgiving.

tea however is not very cost efficient and im annoying about it and like the fancy stuff. matcha ive loved for years, it gives a really nice mellow caffeine high and a bit of a calming feeling, i dont make it into a latte so its very earthy which i love. but its gone very quickly so its just a nice wake up on weekends and holidays. i like chinese pu'erh tea as well and that lasts me a long time as i just keep refilling the cup with hot water until you cant really taste the tea anymore. very caffeinated, good on weekends when i need to do some cleaning.

My daughter is eight. She caught us having sex in the guest bedroom and I don't think she'll ever be the same.

I'd been seeing him for six months. Met him at my gym, he's 29 and works as a personal trainer, all tattoos and confidence, everything my husband isn't. My husband is 41, works in accounting, falls asleep on the couch by 9pm most nights. We've been married ten years and I just felt dead inside.

The affair started simple. Extra workout sessions. Then coffee. Then a hotel room one Thursday afternoon when I was supposed to be at book club. It became this addiction. I couldn't stop and honestly didn't want to.

When my husband suggested we do a week at his parents' beach house in Florida with his whole family, I panicked. A whole week without seeing him felt impossible. That's when I had the idea.

I told my husband my cousin from Seattle was going through a bad breakup and needed to get away. Said I'd invited him to join us for a few days, hope that's okay. My husband is too nice for his own good. He said sure, the more the merrier, his parents have plenty of room.

I bought the plane ticket on my phone. Made the reservation for the same flights as us.

The whole week was insane. My lover stayed in the guest cottage behind the main house. During the day he'd be out by the pool with everyone, playing with my daughter in the water, drinking beers with my husband on the deck. They talked about football. My husband kept saying how cool my ""cousin"" was, how it's great I have family I'm close with.

Every night after my daughter went to sleep and my husband started snoring, I'd slip out. Tell my mother-in-law I was going for a walk on the beach. The cottage was only fifty yards away.

My husband never suspected anything. His parents loved my ""cousin."" His sister kept joking about setting him up with her friend back home.

It was Thursday afternoon, day six of the trip. My husband had taken his dad to some fishing charter. My mother-in-law went to the grocery store. My daughter was supposed to be at the beach with my sister-in-law.

We were in the guest bedroom of the main house. Stupid and reckless but we'd been drinking since lunch and I wasn't thinking straight. The door didn't lock.

My daughter came back early because she forgot her goggles. She walked right in.

The scream that came out of her was inhuman. She just stood there frozen, screaming, then turned and ran. I heard her calling for her dad, crying so hard she was choking on it.

I threw on clothes and chased after her but she locked herself in the bathroom. She was sobbing, saying ""why was he on top of you, where's daddy, I want daddy.""

My sister-in-law came running. She looked at me, looked at him coming out of the bedroom, and her face just went cold. She knew immediately.

My husband got back twenty minutes later. My daughter was hysterical, wouldn't let me near her. She kept saying ""mommy was wrestling with cousin but it wasn't wrestling."" My husband looked so confused, trying to calm her down, asking what happened.

That's when my mother-in-law walked in from getting groceries. She'd found my phone on the kitchen counter. I'd left it there when I went to the bedroom.

She held it up. The screen was showing my email with the plane tickets. Both our names. Same confirmation number.

""This cousin of hers,"" she said, her voice shaking. ""You bought his ticket. Same reservation as yours. Same frequent flyer account.""

Everything stopped.

My husband just stared at the phone. Then at me. Then at him.

""Get out,"" my husband said. His voice was so quiet. ""Get the fuck out of my parents' house.""

My lover grabbed his stuff and left. Didn't even say goodbye, just vanished.

My mother-in-law took my daughter to her room. My daughter was still crying, asking why I hurt daddy.

My husband sat on the couch and didn't move for an hour. His dad stood in the corner looking like he wanted to kill me. His sister called me a sick bitch and said she'd testify in divorce court.

The plane tickets were the thing that broke it open. My mother-in-law started going through everything on my phone after that. Found months of texts. Hotel receipts. Photos I'd been stupid enough not to delete.

She printed them out. All of them. Handed them to my husband in a folder like evidence.

My husband packed our daughter's stuff that night. His parents are keeping her for the rest of the week. He's flying back with her tomorrow. He told me to find my own way home and that his lawyer will contact me.

My daughter won't look at me. She keeps asking her grandmother if her daddy is going to be okay.

I'm sitting in this beach house alone. My lover blocked my number. My husband's family won't speak to me. My own sister called me disgusting when she heard.

I know how this looks. I know what I did. But I'm wondering if I could have handled it differently, if there was a way to do this that wouldn't have destroyed my daughter. AITAH?

Quick recap: old school betrayals, a painful heartbreak, getting ghosted after finally messaging someone on Reddit, yet still pushing myself to attend an old friend's wedding and choose connection over staying stuck in silence. Many of you said it landed at the right time, so I wanted to come back with what happened next.

After years of repeated failures, feeling completely left behind, and one professional exam that blocked my entire career for far too long, I finally cleared it this year after turning 30. I kept moving forward even when it felt pointless. The very weekend after that post, I dragged myself to a small seminar. Someone from an old team recognized me, remembered the work I used to do before everything got stuck, invited me for coffee, and offered me the exact kind of role I thought I'd only start looking for in another 2-3 months, at a level that actually gives back the years those setbacks had taken.

No long interview loops, no compromises. Just one quiet conversation and suddenly everything aligned perfectly.

I'm still the same guy who can overthink a two-word reply. I still recharge alone. But I kept taking the next small uncomfortable step, and the doors I thought were gone forever opened on their own.

To everyone in their 30s who feels behind or broken by failures: your timeline is not late. Things really can click into place when they're meant to, in ways you never forced.

""If it's meant to happen, it will, at the right time, for the right reasons.""

1p851xn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p851xn,My babies,"What better way to do my first Reddit post than to introduce my babies. I have two conures, one is a female green cheek conure that’s a maroon belly (Kiwi) and I have a boy sun conure (Mango). They are the most cutest and adorable birds ever and each have their own spicy personality where they show affection when they want or turn into little raptors when needed. Both have been either adopted or rescued and they are in their forever home with me and my wife. I love them to death and would do anything for my babies. They are out of the cage all day and only are put inside when it’s time to go to bed. We leave their cage doors open and they go in and out as they wish. They also have plenty of perches outside of the cage where they can hang out and jump around and play. We’ve converted them to a pellet and chop diet with the occasional fruits and treats. Kiwi is daddy’s little girl and has bonded with me, so where daddy goes, she goes. They truly are Velcro birds and just want to cruise around my shoulder as I make coffee and do house chores. They are mostly confined to one room for safety reasons and I take them out to other rooms when it’s safe and we know there are no doors opened. They are free flighted as I would never want to clip their wings. These birds are meant to fly for exercise and I can’t imagine taking that freedom away from them. I’ve also been clicker training with them for positive reinforcement and this has been so beneficial and has cemented my bond even further with them. They do flock call when I leave the room but settle down and just chill outside of the cage. I have an avian light for them since they don’t get outdoor sunlight as much as it’s needed. When the weather permits, I take them out in their travel cages to the balcony for some fresh air and natural sun. They have a ton of enrichment toys from shredding to foraging. I just wanted to share and introduce my babies to this thread. I’ve been on here for a long time, reading everyone’s posts and have been wanting to do my own post for quite sometime now.

1p851km,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1p851km/the_lazy_geniuss_guide_to_getting_twice_as_much/,The Lazy Genius’s Guide to Getting Twice as Much Done (Without Burning Out),"We’ve all been there. You tell yourself you’re going to “finally get productive today,” and then…it’s 2am, you’ve accomplished nothing, and your screen time report makes you want to cry. This is ridiculously common. Almost every ambitious person I meet in San Francisco complains about being stuck in cycles of procrastination and low energy. What’s wild is, most of us aren’t even “lazy” in the traditional sense. We’re just overwhelmed, distracted, and burned out by a system that pushes productivity without teaching us how to protect our attention or energy.

This post is NOT one of those recycled TikTok “wake up at 5am and chug celery juice” threads. I dug into legit research, book deep dives, podcasts with neuroscientists, and practical tools from behavioral science. These tips are for the person who wants results but doesn’t want to hustle themselves into exhaustion. If you want to work *less* but get *more* done without feeling like your brain is melting, keep reading.

Here’s the no-BS, research-backed playbook that actually works:

1. **Prioritize “energy management” over time management**

Time blocking means nothing if you're tired or distracted. Cal Newport, author of “Deep Work” (NYT bestseller, MIT-trained computer scientist), argues that most productivity advice ignores something crucial: the ability to focus is like a muscle. It gets depleted. Harvard’s Dr. Daniel Kahneman (Nobel Prize winner) also explains in his book “Thinking, Fast and Slow” that mental fatigue leads us to default into easy-but-unproductive behaviors. So, instead of planning your day around the clock, plan around when your energy naturally peaks (often mid-morning and mid-afternoon) and guard those hours for real work.

2. **Use the “one-tab” rule to eliminate micro distractions**

Every extra tab, app, and notification drains your focus. Productivity researcher Nir Eyal (author of “Indistractable”) found that the average person checks email or a messaging app 77 times per day. Each switch adds ""attention residue"" that reduces cognitive performance. Try this: when doing creative or deep work, open only ONE browser tab. Put your phone in another room or use app blockers like Freedom. You’ll start to notice just how fast your brain gets hijacked when it’s overstimulated.

3. **Try to make learning addictive**

Passive content like Instagram or short-form entertainment hacks your dopamine system. You can resist it—or you can replace it. I recommend the app [Shortform](https://www.shortform.com/) if you're trying to replace social scroll with learning scroll. It gives you in-depth book summaries (not boring ones) and links ideas across books. Great if your attention is short but your curiosity is high.

4. **Use “task bundling” to do boring stuff without pain**

This trick is backed by Katy Milkman, Wharton professor and author of “How to Change” (named one of the best business books by The Financial Times). She calls it “temptation bundling”: pair something unpleasant (like chores, admin work, or working out) with something rewarding. I do my weekly admin work only while watching a guilty pleasure show. No shame. It works because your brain starts associating the task with enjoyment.

5. **Read ONE book that will rewire how you think about work**

Read “4,000 Weeks: Time Management for Mortals” by Oliver Burkeman. It's not a productivity book, but it’s the most important one I’ve read in years. Burkeman is a former productivity columnist who realized most time hacks are just anxiety masking as efficiency. The book is funny, philosophical, and brutally honest about how finite our lives are. It made me rethink how I spend almost every hour. This is the best anti-hustle book I’ve ever read—and it’s helped me work *less* while producing better output.

6. **Don’t start your day with low-quality dopamine**

One of the biggest killers of productivity is starting your day in “dopamine debt.” Dr. Anna Lembke (Stanford psychiatrist and author of “Dopamine Nation”) explains that when we start our mornings with instant gratification (scrolling, junk food, bingeing), we flatten our dopamine response for the rest of the day. That means real work feels boring. Instead: start your morning with something effortful but reward-building—a walk, a cold shower, journaling, 10 minutes of reading. The first 30 minutes of your day are like compound interest for your attention span.

7. **Work in 90-minute sprints, not marathons**

The ultradian rhythm research (originally by Kleitman, later expanded at Stanford) shows that humans function best in 90-minute focus cycles, followed by 20-minute breaks. If you try to push through for hours, your cognition drops and burnout spikes. Set a 90-minute timer, focus hard, then stop. Walk. Breathe. No guilt.

8. **Use this app if you want smarter content, faster**

If you want to replace social media doomscrolling with high-quality learning, BeFreed has been a game changer for me. It’s an AI-powered learning app created by a team from Columbia University. It turns trending books, psychology research, expert interviews, and case studies into mini podcasts or audio series tailored to your interests. You're able to pick the depth (10, 20, or 40 minutes), choose voice tone, and it learns from your choices to build a personalized growth roadmap. It’s perfect if you're always busy but want to retain high-level insights on productivity, psychology, performance, or creativity. This app covers all the books I mentioned earlier—and more. They've got Oliver Burkeman, Cal Newport, Anna Lembke, Katy Milkman, etc. 

The best habit I built recently: 10 minutes of BeFreed while making coffee every morning. It replaced my social scroll and made me 10x more intentional within a week. That, plus 1% self-growth a day, builds a brain compounding effect that feels insane after a month.

9. **Watch this YouTube series if you hate hustle culture**

Ali Abdaal’s “Productivity for Lazy People” series dismantles toxic hustle culture while giving actual Neuroscience-backed tips. Worth watching if you’ve tried every time-blocking hack and still feel scattered. His interviews with researchers and founders helped me recalibrate how I work.

10. **Listen to this podcast if you want smarter habits**

Listen to “Huberman Lab,” an insanely good podcast by Dr. Andrew Huberman (a Stanford neuroscientist). His episodes on time perception, dopamine, and goal setting are some of the most science-backed frameworks to understand how focus really works. Start with his episode: “How to Increase Motivation and Drive,” especially if you often feel stuck or low-energy.

Hope this list helps you do less but live more.

1p850zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningToBecome/comments/1p850zb/how_to_build_a_personal_brand_at_work_without/,How to build a personal brand at work (without being cringe or fake),"We all know someone at work who somehow gets credit in every meeting, gets pulled into the best projects, or is introduced like a celebrity when new people join. And no, it’s not always because they’re *better* at their job. A lot of the time, they’ve just mastered the skill of building a personal brand in the workplace. 

This phrase gets thrown around a lot, and most of the time it sounds like something fake influencers say on LinkedIn while selling you a cheap course. But workplace branding isn't about being loud or shameless. It’s about making your value visible in a way that aligns with who you really are. 

Too many people feel like they’re invisible at work, not noticed in meetings, not considered for promotions, not trusted with high-impact stuff. So this post is a breakdown of what actually works when it comes to building a personal brand at work, based on research, expert insights, and some of the best books and podcasts I’ve consumed. No BS, no fake confidence tips, no “just be yourself” fluff. 

**Build a reputation, not a persona.**  
People can tell when you’re acting. Instead of fabricating a brand (like being overly charismatic when that’s not your strength), identify and amplify what *already* sets you apart. According to Dorie Clark, author of *Reinventing You*, the most effective personal brands are rooted in authenticity. In her interview with Harvard Business Review, she emphasizes the importance of understanding how others currently perceive you and using that as a starting point. Don’t invent a character. Clarify and amplify your actual strengths.

**Be known for something specific.**  
According to research from the Center for Talent Innovation, people who are seen as “go-to” experts in a particular area are 2.5 times more likely to be promoted. General competence isn’t memorable. “That person is helpful” doesn’t stick. “That person is a magician with data storytelling” does. Don’t try to be known for everything. Be known for *one* thing that your coworkers instantly associate with your name.

**Master strategic visibility.**  
You don’t need to talk in every meeting or post in every Slack channel. But you *do* need to strategically show up where decisions are made. Sylvia Ann Hewlett calls this “sponsorship visibility” in her book *Executive Presence*. It’s the idea that presence isn’t just about performance, it’s about being seen in the right rooms, by the right people, so your work doesn’t go unnoticed. Look for opportunities to present key updates, represent your team, or volunteer for visible initiatives that align with your goals.

**Social proof matters at work, too.**  
People subconsciously rely on what others say about you more than what *you* say about yourself. Research from the University of North Carolina found that peer feedback influences manager evaluations even more than direct performance metrics. One simple tip? Use reciprocity. Publicly appreciate others’ contributions (in emails, Slack, meetings) and they’ll quite often return the favor. You’re shaping how people talk about you behind closed doors.

**Communicate your value without bragging.**  
If you struggle to talk about your achievements without feeling like a narcissist, try “I statements” that contain insights or gratitude. Instead of saying “I crushed that project,” say “I learned a lot while leading this project and I appreciated how the team trusted me with it.” That shows leadership, growth, and collaboration. It’s humble but still makes your results visible.

**Don’t just perform, translate.**  
It’s not enough to do great work. You need to *frame* it in a way your audience understands and values. As Herminia Ibarra puts it in her HBR article “The Authenticity Paradox,” people who move forward at work know how to adapt their communication style without losing who they are. This isn’t about being fake, it’s about being effective. Learn how to tailor your messaging so execs, cross-functional teams, and clients see the impact from *their* perspective.

**Reduce the friction of learning how to self-advocate.**  
For most of us, building a personal brand doesn’t feel natural. That’s why it helps to learn in small bursts, on your own terms. I’ve found a few different resources that helped me level up this skill without reading 300 pages of corporate jargon that made me want to punch a wall:

**Book: “The Long Game” by Dorie Clark**  
This isn’t just another productivity book, it’s an insanely good read on how to play the *strategic patience* game in your career. Clark (whom Harvard Business Review named a top business thinker) talks about long-term influence, not short-term hype. After finishing it, I changed how I approached mentorship, career planning, even side projects. This book will make you question everything you think you know about “success.” Easily the best career development book I’ve ever read.

**Podcast: “The Look & Sound of Leadership” by Tom Henschel**  
Tom is an executive coach who works with Fortune 500 leaders, and his podcast episodes are short, practical, and painfully smart. He dives into topics like “Handling Feedback with Grace” or “Crafting a Leadership Story” in under 15 minutes. It’s like having a personal coach in your ears during your morning walk. High signal, no fluff.

**App: Endel**  
I use this during deep work sessions and hard focus days at my job. It generates personalized background soundscapes based on your circadian rhythm, heart rate, and focus levels. It’s designed by neuroscientists and backed by studies on how sound affects productivity. Helps me tune out distractions and slip into deep focus without needing coffee or lo-fi study videos.

**App: BeFreed**  
When I started taking personal branding more seriously, I used BeFreed to learn on the fly. It’s this smart audio learning app that turns your questions into personalized podcast-style audio. I’d ask something like “how do I communicate better as an introvert at work” and it would create an episode pulling from books, research, and interviews. What surprised me was how I could pause the audio mid-way, ask it to go deeper into something that clicked, and it would adjust the content on the spot. Super helpful during commutes or gym when I want something more useful than TikTok. And I can switch the podcast voice depending on my mood, hyping me up or calming me down. Pretty addictive in the best way.

**YouTube: Charisma on Command's deep dives**  
Yes, Carl’s YouTube thumbnails look kinda clickbait-y, but his breakdowns of communication tactics are actually gold. His analysis of how people like Obama or Keanu Reeves use subtle tactics to be remembered and trusted helped me understand how nonverbal signals affect how people see you. Especially helpful if you’re shy or tend to be overlooked.

Your work doesn’t speak for itself. *You* do. And once you understand how to make that voice stronger, not louder, you’ll stop relying on luck to get noticed.

My Meta CPM went up out of nowhere. TikTok stopped giving me cheap traffic. And the worst part was not even the spend. It was the feeling of doing the same content loop again and again.

Every new variation meant money leaving my bank account.Every reshoot meant another late night.Every small agency update took days.And whenever an ad underperformed, it felt like watching myself throw cash straight into a fire.

A few weeks ago I sat down with a coffee and finally looked through my last ninety days of creatives. I thought I would find some kind of pattern. What I actually found was just pain.

My best performing ads were basically the fast experimental ones I made half asleep.

The polished ones did not save anything.

Re editing did not save anything.

My workflow was slow.And I was paying too much for content I only used for maybe seven days.

So I changed the approach a little. Instead of making fewer perfect videos, I focused on making more testable variations. Not low effort noise. I just needed a way to test faster so I could stop emotionally adopting every single ad.

I started using a few AI based tools to speed up repetitive edits. Nothing fancy. Some were awful. Some were actually usable. The main thing is that they helped me test ideas before I spent more money on shoots.

Surprisingly my performance did not drop. My CTR became more stable simply because I finally had enough angles cycling through.

This whole thing made me rethink what matters more in ecommerce right now. Quality is still important. But speed and emotional survival might matter even more.

How are you all dealing with rising creative costs this year?Are you going heavier on expensive production or just embracing faster iterations?

Grew up with a single mom. Don't have any connection with my father or paternal family. He simply walked out on us. 
 
Growing up I never really felt the need of a father figure, my mom did her best.
But things changed when I was 16, some circumstances happened that I started to question how am I going to take the responsibility of the house. 
Even in my maternal family I did not have any father figure, so I just don't have that reference point, the blue print, for how I'm supposed to be, the kind of man I'm supposed to be. 

I completely lost interest in studies, I start to see my friends differently...they had everything....and I started to feel as if I'm not enough. 
I could have scored+95% in 12th if I studied hard, but I ended up scoring far less. Didn't give any entrance exams.

I dropped a year be because I just didn't know what the fuck am I supposed to do.
By this time, just a year after school, I basically lost all my friends. 

After dropping a year I joined a tier 3 college and pursued an absolutely useless degree. 

Even during the college I just couldn't relate to with the people around me. Barely had any friends. 

I used to be the guy sitting in the middle row at the very front, just listening to the lectures all alone on that bench. 

It wasn't like I was short or ugly or dumb or whatever, I just didn't find anyone worth talking to. 

Never went out with anyone during the college. Never. Not even a coffee, chai, movie, car drive nothing. 

Then came Covid. Vo to I guess sabka hi isolated and depressing nikla, but for me....well I just further spiraled down in the misery. 
Lost interest in my family as well. I wasn't living I was merely existing. 

Got into trading and shit, tried a lot but ended up with huge losses. 
More about it here - https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/s/yaNygSnhsx

When I hit 22, I started to crave a father figure, like someone who could guide me, someone who can point out what am I doing wrong? Or right? 

And now at 26 I crave for a father figure, I just want to just want to wrap my arms around him and cry my heart out. 

Jo thode bohot friends the they never understood me...so they drifted away. 

A lot happened in the past 4-5 yrs. I lost my confidence, my self esteem, self worth. 
I've barely had any human connections. Even a street dog has more human connections than me.

I wan to have friends, not talking about a gf (I know no one will find me worth dating)....but BC male friendships. 

How to talk to girls, always heard from mom - just focus on studies, don't talk to girls. 
I feel so nervous around women now, it's unhealthy. 
People my age are just enjoying, infact they have been enjoying ever since 16, when things started going south ways for me. 
I feel like I'm living in a limbo. 

Only men can understand men.

Having grown up without a father, I feel like I'm a grown up child. 
I know nothing about insurances, credit cards, taxes, politics, country mein kya chal raha hai mughe ghanta naahi pata I second guess every decision I make. 

Always at the back of my head I'm thinking if I'm doing this right? I don't have confidence in my actions, my words. 

Upar se my career is mess, just started at 26, and moving at a snails pace. 

I don't know how am I supposed to move forward. 

P.S - Earlier this year, an online friend, whom I've known for the past 4yrs, someone older to me, asked me why do I not have friends and a gf? Bloody that's when it hit me that I really do need human connections....I can't keep living like this.",0,1764256991.0,gurgaon,14,0.5,False

He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of sea salt coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' and ‘wholesome’ dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.

So if you’re into third wave coffee, perpetual curiosity, and the full spectrum of nerdy pursuits, this particular vertical human might be worth your time. Dating really does feel like job hunting sometimes, doesn’t it? LOL! You either get guys who hasn’t moved on with their exes, who sends nsfw stuff right away or you get a friendly one so I figured why not lean into the absurdity and write this like a bloody resume. The joke entertained me, at least.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into small business and investments, 2nd year law student (took a LOA atm), can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck lol (/s towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex-cheating issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha). Last relationship (6 years) was 3 years ago and dated someone last year but didn’t worked out.

- I'm 5'9"", physically fit and active, resides in QC. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and very hygienic

- I'm an INTJ-T Arch, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in that people only have 12 personalities.

- Loves to read history, finance and self-help books not because I’m smart rich but I believe about continous learning and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as really awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set long-term feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism. Respects personal space and time

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, drugs, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, physically active and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

—and ideally, someone who enjoys staying active too, so we can share more than just deep conversations—maybe runs, hikes, or muay thai sessions together. Shared passions make connections even stronger.

Let's take a break from stressing over the mundane and focus on the important stuff - like what will make us happy for the rest of our lives! Share your thoughtys on how we can achieve that and let's get this happiness train moving! Send me your pic and I'll send mine to get started.

**Edit, 11/22/2025**

Posting again to try to find the right match. I’ve connected with some great people through here, but the timing or connection hasn’t always worked out.

I’m hoping to meet someone who stays active, has self-assurance, maintains a healthy weight, and lives substance-free. I’d also like to avoid situations where someone is still recovering from a recent relationship, as I’m beyond the age where I want to be a transitional person for someone.

It would be helpful if we could share pictures relatively soon to gauge whether there’s physical chemistry before spending a lot of time getting to know each other.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",4,1764256948.0,PhR4Dating,0,1.0,False
1p84so2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Decor/comments/1p84so2/my_apartment_is_starting_to_look_like_a_museum_of/,My Apartment Is Starting to Look Like a Museum of Random Decisions,"I’ve been slowly furnishing my apartment over the last year, mostly because I cannot make decisions under pressure and also because I keep convincing myself that “I’ll know the right piece when I see it.” I never know. I just stand in stores staring at chairs like they’re philosophical questions.  
But last week, something finally broke me. I walked into my living room, looked around, and realized every single piece of furniture came from a completely different aesthetic universe.  
I have:  
  
a minimalist Scandinavian coffee table  
  
a neon beanbag that my friend gave me as a joke  
  
a bookcase that leans so dramatically it looks like it’s trying to escape  
  
and one very elaborate lamp that feels like it belongs in a wizard’s study  
  
It’s like my apartment can’t decide who it wants to be when it grows up.  
So I decide: It’s time. I’m going to buy one nice statement piece to pull the room together. Something classy. Something intentional.  
I went online and after about 20 minutes of scrolling, I fell down a rabbit hole of Turkish furniture, hand-carved accents, intricate patterns, and warm colors. Suddenly I’m imagining a couch that looks like it belongs in a historic mansion, not a one-bedroom apartment with mismatched bowls and a dying succulent.  
Of course, this sends me spiraling into comparing styles, prices, and whether this is a normal impulse or the beginning of a personality crisis. At one point I even sent a picture to a friend for advice, and instead of helping, she goes, “Why does this look like something you’d find next to a fountain in a palace courtyard?” That's exactly why I liked it.  
Anyway, somewhere in my search, I stumbled across a bunch of similar pieces on Alibaba, which didn’t help my decision-making at all, because now I have 47 tabs open and zero commitment to any of them.  
In the end, I bought nothing. Absolutely nothing. I closed my laptop, ate a snack, and went back to sitting in my living room of chaos like a raccoon in a thrift store.  
But at least now I know the name of the style I apparently want to pursue if I ever decide to become a person with a cohesive aesthetic.

Hello! I know this is probably a shot in the dark but let’s give it a try anyway!

I’m a truly hopeless romantic. Give me cliché stuff, gentle romance, quiet nights, sharing life with my person, making memories, being there for each other, all that classic relationship stuff. But here comes the tricky bit: I’m also asexual. Meaning I’m not up for anything sexual, *ever*. Which, to no surprise, has made my love life a bit challenging. Maybe we’ll change that? I offer you dry humour, teasing as a love language, random info dumps and loads of cuddles. Needless to say, I’d love a partner who accepts my boundaries and is happy without any bedroom activities, so someone with a very low drive, or maybe I’ll strike it lucky and you’re ace too! **So, in a nutshell**, I’m looking for a monogamous long term relationship. Easier said than done, being ace, but never say never!

Now, since lists are clear and effective, have some!

**Who I am:**

* 27 years old
* from the dark forests of Finland
* atheist and a progressive person (liberal, leftie, woke, you get it)
* childfree
* chubby and short, short dark brown hair (but it changes, it’s been blue, purple, red…)
* some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve
* don’t smoke or drink at all, my only vice is coke zero
* city girl, love culture, museums, theater, coffee shops, shopping etc.
* into writing, reading, photography, fashion, city holidays, binging tv shows
* not athletic or outdoorsy lol
* sadly very allergic to pets :/

**Who I’m looking for:**

* no one younger than 25 please
* ideally located in Europe
* doesn't want children
* knows what he wants, emotionally intelligent, honest, humorous
* someone I can have deep conversations with but also goof around

**Dealbreakers/ Big NOs for me:**

* sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, bigotry in general
* drugs, smoking, drinking a lot

I never said anything, but Ms. Carter must’ve noticed.

Last week, she handed me a reusable coffee cup and a granola bar before class: “Figured you could use something to hold you over.” Then she slipped me a transit card with a note: “This has a month’s pass—no strings attached. I remember what it’s like to juggle work, school, and transit. Focus on learning, not rushing.”

I tried to refuse, but she shook her head: “Pay it forward someday.” Turns out she’d asked the campus office for a discounted pass and chipped in her own money.

I turned 30-years-old earlier this year, and have been smoking since I was 15, and these past 7 or 8 years, CHS has been quite the challenge. 

CHS is not even something I'd wish upon my worst enemy, my people have had their lives completely ruined by this unfortunate and rare condition.

1p84lwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultKids/comments/1p84lwg/i_wonder_how_my_mom_feels/,I wonder how my mom feels,"I went no contact with my mom at the end of August this year after she blew up in my dog’s face over spilt coffee.

It was an accident. I came over to help her and my grandma (they live together) with summer cleaning and when I let my dog into the apartment, she ran into the kitchen to greet my mom (as she has always done) and knocked into the table with the coffee. The mug spilled, but no damage was done. She yelled like my dog killed someone and she obviously had no idea why she was not being greeted.
It triggered a memory in me when I was 9 or 10 years old and I spilled a juice box and she screamed at me being a clumsy cow, beat me and sent me to my room. I worked through the memory, closed my dog in the bathroom and helped her clean up. She kept on sighing loudly and angrily wiped up the coffee. After several minutes I told her to stop, that nothing bad happened and the dog was just happy to see her. She walked away and didn’t say anything else, just kept angrily cleaning up. I knew in that moment that she would behave the same for the rest of the day, so I decided to leave. I left a few gifts I got her on the table and put the harness back on my dog when she stormed out of the room and started yelling again, asking “where do you think you’re going?!” and I calmly told her that I am leaving, since I refuse to stay here, if she is going to behave like this. A screaming match started with only her being the participant, so I turned around and just left. Took my dog on a walk and cried the whole time. Drove back home afterwards and called my grandma back, since I had unanswered calls from her. She took my mom’s side and said I overreacted and that I shouldn’t have taken my dog in the first place. Which has never been said by them, when I asked I could take my dog.
I talked to my therapist about the situation a few days later and was assured that what I did was okay and I shouldn’t feel guilty. She told me that if I want to keep in contact with my mom, maybe it would be good to reach out and explain why I reacted the way I did.
So I did that. I sent her message explaining my feelings and views on situations in the past that had somehow hurt me. At the end I told her I want to stay in contact with her, I just want her to know that I will not be screamed at over nothing.
Her response was that I should call grandma to set up a lunch date and that she will make sure that she won’t be home since she bothers me so much… Clearly, she didn’t read anything I messaged her.

Since then I kind of started a different life it feels. I got my ear pierced, started wearing make up, painted my walls bright colorful colors, rearranged my house, got another dog,… all the things she and my grandma always talked me out of. Overall, I feel much better.

However, with the holidays approaching, I started to feel sad again. I always wonder how she’s doing. When I see something in the shop that she’d like, I immediately go to pick it up thinking I’d buy it for her… I tried to reach out after a particularly hard night and sent her a picture of the puppy, hoping it would be a good ice breaker… she left me on read.

I am no stranger to no contact. I was no contact with my father since I was 17 and moved out. Didn’t see him until I was 22 on Christmas Eve when my mom begged me to drive her to his house, because he wasn’t answering her calls (they split up a few years ago). Basically dragged him back to the land of the living and then he passed in April. When he passed, my mom called me, sobbing hysterically that “we only have each other now”.

Now I just wonder… how must she feel that her only daughter isn’t talking to her? Does she miss me? Does she miss my dog? Does she regret what happened?

We are not complex coffee drinkers, but I don’t want to spend the $400 Breville quoted me to repair the grinder with the same parts that failed in just over a year. She drinks a medium roast decaf and I drink regular in a variety of roasts, but most commonly light and medium. We’re in the US. We originally bought the BP thinking it would be a good “prosumer” option and because it’s reasonably convenient. Because we drink different roasts, we had been grinding 1 latte’s worth of beans at a time (double shot).

We aren’t fussy. I don’t even have much of a sense of smell, so I don’t expect to be able to tell the difference between burrs. We just want a decent grinder that we can use to grind a double shot’s worth at a time twice a day and won’t break in a year. I’m open to manual or electric options. We enjoyed the lattes we got from the Barista Pro to give you a sense of our “coffee maturity”.  They were fine. While I’d love to imagine myself as a coffee aficionado, being realistic I’m a caffeine addict who is fine with drip but prefers a basic latte, is willing to spend a little more for a little more quality, but doesn’t like to overspend on something I know I won’t appreciate.

and before we became a thing i had told him smth like “i'm scared okay, i was scared that you were just playing around with me, scared cause i didnt want to waste my time on something which wasnt going anywhere and scared because im getting attached”, he replied with “dont be im not that type of a guy and i would never do such a thing” “Like ik u being scared makes sense but trust me I won't do anything that the thing ur scared of happening will happen” so i fell for that. on the 23rd of august we went out for coffee and i asked him lets go to my friend’s bday party but he had sports practice and he couldnt and after the hangout, we hugged which felt heavenly and i went home to get ready for the party, and while i was still home he texted that he wanted to kiss me earlier and i said why didnt you? and he replied with “cause i thought you didnt want to” and obv i was bruh wth, anyway, i went to the bday party which was near  the place he practiced and around 6:30 ish he texted me that his practice was over and i begged him to come see me, and ultimately agreed and we met talked for awhile and thats when we both had our first kiss and i know we were moving fast atp, and he went back home and i went back to the party and the entire time we were on call and texting, and later he said “I also was bitting my lips the whole time while going home” and i really thought i meant something and 24th august, we were talking about the tournament and hes like “damn i knew you loved me since that day” and im like “uhuh and im like “do you?” and thats when he said “i love you” for the first time and like i said i was over the moon, and monday we had school and after school he would be the first one to call me and text me everytime, and he asked me out officially. this continued for a while but his mom found out about our relationship and she wasnt thrilled cause it wasnt the right time yet and yeah after that he only got his phone for few hours a day, but he would still call or text me, fast forward to a month of us dating, i invited him over, he met my mom and all and i really thought he was the one for me but anyways, he came over twice and in october he had to go play out of State, and still we texted, talked alot and when he came back he got me things like a keychain and this cute light thingy but on the 22nd of october which was our two month, he broke up with me cause apparently his found mom found some of our chats which were a little inappropriate and she told him to break up with me and not talk to me anymore blahblahblah, obv i was devastated, i cried hard for so many weeks, i couldnt eat, sleep or do anything, i even cried in front of him in school and he did say that when the time is right we’ll get back together but i remember it was 27th of october we were talking about smth and he kissed me outta nowhere, and after that he told me to “move on” and alot of things happened and he said that he wasnt thinking straight and that he was sorry and all and on the 2nd of November was his bday i gave him a gift in the morning and during recess i was reading smth to him and after that he said he wanted to move on and i was like wtf? cause i thought it was still fine but he said that i just wanted to cry and on the 3rd i found that he told his friends that he was only with me for the attention i gave him when the girl he liked didnt, i was just a rebound and i never meant anything to him, he threw away the letters i gave him and all, and when i confronted him he said “im sorry and blahbalhblah” and that he was ashamed of what he did to me.",2,1764256390.0,story,0,1.0,False
1p84las,https://i.redd.it/514sa4mfft3g1.jpeg,The Economics of Staking: How Hayabusa Rewards Real Activity,"Our new economic model has a simple idea at its core: active participation should correlate with protocol rewards. In Hayabusa, this approach is a central tenet. VTHO is no longer generated idly, but instead, solely as the product of staked VET, rewarding those who actively contribute to the network’s economic security via StarGate.

Conversely, every time someone creates a transaction, they pay VTHO as gas, with the base fee 100% burned. Any ‘priority fee’ payments go straight to the Validator who mined the respective block. Block rewards for any given block are split between Validators and their Delegators, at a 30:70 ratio.

VeBetter complements this flywheel. It transforms everyday user actions, into on-chain transactions, consumes VTHO and gives circularity to the model. The more people act through VeBetter and other applications, the more demand for VTHO, and so, the more rewarding staking becomes.

**Hayabusa will merge with the VeCainThor mainnet on Dec 2, 2025 - prepare yourself by downloading** [**VeWorld**](https://veworld.com/) **and minting your StarGate staking NFT!**

# Getting Paid to Participate

From a VET holder’s point of view, the process of benefiting from Hayabusa is simple:

You stake VET through StarGate and receive a staking NFT that represents your collateral. That NFT passes through a short maturity period, or you can use Boost to skip the wait by paying a fee in VTHO, which is then burned. Once the maturity period has passed and the NFT is eligible, you delegate it to a Validator, with Validator reward cycles operating in periods of 7, 15, or 30 days.

This ensures staking has a clear rhythm - a known cycle, and a defined moment when rewards are made available. 

# Delegator, Validator, or Non-stakers

You can breakdown the new economics into three simple roles:

**Delegator (staked VET holder)**   
If you hold VET and contribute your stake to a Validator, you are a Delegator. You earn VTHO only while your VET stake is delegated. Your share of rewards is calculated by your effective stake, which equals the amount of VET staked multiplied by your NFT tier multiplier. Rewards accrue during the Validator’s 7, 15 or 30-day period and become claimable at its end.

**Validator**   
Validators run VeChainThor's critical infrastructure. In return, they receive 30 percent of block rewards plus 100 percent of any priority fees on blocks they produce. The remaining 70 percent of block rewards flows to Delegators, split by effective stake. Good uptime, clear communication, and fair commission rates make a Validator attractive to Delegators over time.

**Non-staked VET holder**   
If you hold VET but choose not to stake and delegate, you do not generate or earn VTHO after Hayabusa. You still have exposure to network upside, but you are not participating in the reward stream.

Earning VTHO rewards is no longer about simply owning VET. It is about being rewarded for your role in contributing to the security of our network.

# How Rewards Arise

When a user interacts with an application and writes to the blockchain, they create transactions that require fees paid in VTHO. The base fee is burned permanently, and any priority fees are paid to the Validator who mined the respective block. 

In the background, the protocol generates VTHO block rewards in a dynamic fashion, as a product of an issuance curve derived from total VET staked. Those rewards are split 70 percent to Delegators and 30 percent to the Validator which is distributed according to each participant’s effective stake. A new interconnected economic web where you and your stake play a central role.

From a Delegator’s perspective, rewards depend on three things:

* How often your Validator mines a block
* How much stake, and what combination of tiers, are delegated to that Validator
* Total VET stake across the network

# VTHO Issuance Becomes Dynamic

Under the old model, VTHO was generated continuously for all VET, regardless of whether it was actively securing the network or not. Hayabusa changes that.

Issuance now routes to Delegators and Validators only. In other words, VTHO is generated solely as a reward for those who commit stake and run or support Validators. At the same time, VeChain’s fee system burns the base fee of every transaction. As adoption grows, burn scales up and accelerates deflationary effects for VTHO.

The result is a cleaner balance between issuance and burn. More stake means more participants sharing the reward pool. More real-world usage increases burn and offsets issuance. Over time, this combination is designed to reduce inflation pressure and improve the quality of yield for active contributors, refining the network's tokenomics and serving the needs of every stakeholder.

# Staking Choices and Models

Hayabusa gives VET holders two main ways to participate in securing the network.

**Running a validator**   
This path suits participants who can manage infrastructure. Validators commit stake, maintain uptime and compete on performance and reputation. They earn a fixed share of block rewards and keep all priority fees from the blocks they propose.

**Delegating stake**   
Most holders will delegate. You stake through StarGate, choose a Validator, and your staking NFT does the heavy lifting behind the scenes. You do not manage servers. You simply monitor your Validator’s performance, renew or exit at the end of each period, and decide whether to claim or restake your rewards.

Tiers add another layer of choice. Higher tier NFTs apply higher multipliers to your staked VET, which increases your share of the reward pool at a given validator. For long term participants, tier strategy can become an important part of their approach.

# Closing the Loop: Staking and VeBetter

[VeBetter](https://vebetter.com/) is where the economics of staking meet everyday life.

VeBetter applications let people earn from actions that are useful in the real world: wellness habits, sustainable choices, community tasks and more. Each verified action becomes an on-chain transaction. That transaction consumes VTHO gas. The base fee burns and then the transaction is packaged into a block that helps generate the reward stream for validators and delegators.

If you stake and delegate, you participate in this flow. As VeBetter grows, as more brands and communities build into it, the volume of these actions increases. That means more transactions, more burn, and a stronger foundation for staking rewards.

I'm trying this again, and no I didn't just copy and paste my previous post haha

I'm 26 years old and a data scientist / programmer. Dating apps don't really seem to work well for me, so I'm here!

I'm ADHD (and probably on the spectrum. I tend to hyperfixate on my interests but a few have cropped up over time and stuck with me. One of those is specialty coffee. I'm a huge nerd when it comes to excellent coffee, and I'm really spoiled by one of my local shops because it's *world class*. Another interest is Tolkien;  I got really into LOTR as a teenager but never read the main series until college. After that I became invested and read the Silmarillion and a bunch of other work by him too. I've also been known to enjoy reading court filings for fun, I've tried to tell people it's not as nerdy as it sounds but they don't believe me. I really enjoy it though!

My most recent hyperfixation has been ballroom dancing, mostly because I read almost all of war and peace, and I became obsessed with the idea of dancing a proper waltz. But I've found the activity to be wonderful exercise and helps me work through my innate wallflowerness. 

Aa far as my politics go, I'm a progressive. It kind of started as a joke in high school geography where I would pick the communist countries to give a report on them but then I got introduced to actual American leftists like Eugene Debs and I was sold. A wonderful history teacher really helped me start to think for myself.  I care about the world around me being a better place, and I hope you do too!

I love traveling and sincerely want to do more throughout life.

I consider myself a Christian. 

What I'm looking for:

I want genuine connection. I love talking about the mundane things and the deep things too, and I also love being able to switch between the two easily.

I also greatly value intention and effort. I also think the deskre to grow together is a really important aspect of a relationship.

I want someone to adore! I'm very obsessed with the idea of doing the most for my eventual partner. I want to lasso the moon for a partner (if you get the reference, lmk!)

Physically I prefer a slimmer build, whether or not you're athletic doesn't matter as much to me! I tend to prefer darker haired people but this is not a strict preference.

Intellectually, I prefer if you're college educated and still curious! (Bonus points if you're a lover of the humanities) I would like it if you have your own career goals and are actively working towards them. 

I'm open to an LDR but please be within the United States. Ideally I would prefer a life long partnership but I know that doesn't happen overnight and it will take work from both of us.

Thank you for reading all of this! I'd really like to hear what your favorite song is right now so I know you've read this message.

My parents (M70) (F60) neglected me severely growing up and I pretty much raised myself. I started cooking at age 9 to feed myself and there's so much I had to learn on my own. I also faced a lot of emotional abuse.

On my 30th birthday, everything changed for me. We went out for a family dinner and at the end my parents told me they had no money and that I had to pay for everyone. My mom said I'm an embarrassment because I'm single at my 30th birthday. They also got me no gift or card claiming they have no money. Something inside me broke after that birthday. I realized no matter how much effort and care I put in, they don't care about me. It's always about their needs over mine. I help them out financially.

In comparison, my sister (F49) doesn't work, she relies on my parents to pay for her rent and expenses and she's clearly the favourite because they will pay for all her expenses but for example if we go to a cafe, they will not even pay a $2 coffee for me.

Recently I sent my sister (49F) $1500 because she claimed she had no money at all. 2 days later my dad asked her if she had any money and she said she she had no money and she was so hungry like WTAF? I told him she's lying but they sent her more money anyways.

I'm the black sheep of the family and I've come to realize that and admit it. It's just after my birthday something changed and I just feel like devastated. I'm in a lot of pain emotionally.


TLDR: I grew up neglected and emotionally abused, and even now at 30 my parents still treat me like I don’t matter. They favour my older sister, pay all her bills, and won’t even buy me a coffee. I helped her with $1500 and she still lied about having no money while my parents kept giving her more. My birthday was the last straw because they made me pay for everyone and called me an embarrassment. I finally realized I’m the black sheep and it really hurts.",40,1764256264.0,relationships,53,0.83,False

I saw a bunch of posts asking questions about the weight loss patches in other places, so I wanted to give an honest review, as I experience it, with updates as the days go by. I want to preface this with the fact that I am not a doctor, and things work differently for different people. I just want to essentially provide a legitimate, non-sponsored experience that you can use to make your own decision with your doctor, as I did with mine. I am not paid or sponsored for this review; I paid for my product and am only providing the brand so that you know which particular patch I used for reference of my experience.

My backstory:   
38 years old  
Bio female  
5'5"" tall  
260 lbs  
I have PCOS and I have gone through MANY treatments from hormone therapies to surgeries. I have been working with a dietician for about a year and a half and although i am following strict instructions (i mean strictly following not that the instructions are fad-diet level or anything) regarding my macros, and steadily increasing my activity level, In over a year and 6 months i have only lost about 10 lbs. so obviously diet and excersize alone are not helping the PCOS weight.   
  
So, I went back to my PCOS doctor and she said the main medication we haven't tried but would likely work is glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) hormones. These can be found in the popular compounded versions of the suuuper popular injections; however, because of the surge of popularity of these, insurance will only cover them if I am diabetic, which, thankfully, I am not. I don't want to become diabetic just for the insurance to cover the medication I need, and these meds are astronomical without insurance. So I researched other methods and found some articles on Ledisa patches.

They are an herbal alternative from what I can tell, so I did a bunch of research and they may not work, but they may, and from the article i read it looked like a bunch of people liked them over the other brands that advertise the patches, so I purchased 3 months worth, and pulled back on any interacting medications under the supervision of my doctor. 

Day 1 Update:  
The patches are to be used for 6 hours and there are 30 in a pouch. I had already had my coffee before I put one on today. About 30 minutes in I could feel a little more jitters come on, kinda like I had another cup or two of coffee. About an hour in a wave of nausea for about 10 minutes. wasn't hungry till about 3 hours in and that came with a small heartbeat headache. my intestines were a bit grumbly for the rest of the time and by the end of the 6 hours i felt like i was starving, but then ate a minimal portion and felt really uncomfortably full.

Will update in a week

Decent money, interesting problems, sometimes too interesting, and a lot of coffee. But now that I am in my forties I keep thinking about what comes next. I have no idea how people pick a second career once they have already done a whole first one. I have a wife and kids so this isn’t an easy choice. 

Part of me thinks I should stay in tech because I understand it and I know how to survive in it. The other part keeps coming back to something I always thought about when I was younger. I wanted to be a pilot. No idea if that is a realistic thought at my age or if I am just tired and daydreaming about something different.

I am doing the usual cleanup work while I think it through. Updated my resume, touched up LinkedIn, replaced my old photo with a newer one I made in Selfio because the old one was just bad. None of this tells me what to do but at least I look a bit more awake on paper.

I guess I am trying to understand how people actually choose a new direction. Do you go with your gut. Do you run the numbers. Do you try small steps and see what sticks. If anyone has gone from tech to something completely different or even into aviation I would really like to hear how you figured it out. At least, how did your significant other take it? 

Right now I cant tell if this is a real path or just a passing idea that feels good because it is new.",1,1764255739.0,careeradvice,6,1.0,False

so i wrote down word for word

here it is:

There are barn doors and there are revolving doors

doors in the rudders of big ships

and there are revolving doors

there are doors that open by themselves

there are sliding doors and there are secret doors.

There are doors lock, and there are doors that don't.

There are doors that let you in and out but never open

and there are trap doors that you can't come back from.



He was good man

they said he was a gentleman

they said even when life spat in his face

he put everything back in its right place.



A march of killer ants sideway down sidewalks

claws clanging in meltdown noon heat frenzy.

Lobster skin shopping mall, coffee strained lip, sync bodies.



I am in an underground house basement

or at least this part is underground

I spend a lot of my time in this place when in dreams there's a manhole cover

and these faceless figures are creeping inside and I can't stop them

and we'll pick you up by the heels, we'll shake it all out of you.



The names have changed

the innocent, the innocenty have been used to thicken the soupy

the soupy can be used to feed the troopys.

form tin cans I was tempered, nipped and tucked

for a magazine smiling sweetly reclining in expensive desirable furniture

for your pleasure in a magazine.



I used to think I used think there was no future left at all

I used to think thesis, antthesis, synthesis paralysis.



This song will not make you strong

this song will not give you brains or help you look the other way

I want you to know he's not coming back

look into my eyes

I'm not coming back.

and we all went to heaven in a little row boat

there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt.

He shows affection but avoids commitment. What do I do?,"I (29F) have been in a situationship with my boss for a little over a year, and I’m struggling with the mixed signals.

We started casually, fwb type. Then halfway through the year when I started working for him (his idea btw) I developed real feelings. I’m emotionally open and attach deeply, while he is extremely private and avoidant. He never talks about past relationships, so I don’t know if it’s fear, trauma, or something else.

The confusing part is that it’s clear he likes me. not just physically. It’s so evident to people around us.
He initiates most of our contact, checks on me regularly, calls me every nigh before bed, notices when I’m distant, and even drove by my house recently when I wasn’t responding. He buys me coffee or food, takes me on errand, spends time doing everyday partner-like activities, and trusts me with very personal things (his home, his dog, his truck). The chemistry and comfort between us feels real.

But despite acting like a couple, he refuses to define anything.
Any time I try to talk about clarity or feelings, it’s like pulling teeth. He avoids emotional conversations and won’t commit to anything romantically — not now and not in the future.

I’ve tried distancing myself multiple times, telling him I don’t want to have contact outside of work, and he always reaches back out eventually, which pulls me right back into the cycle. He lay on the charm thick and bring me coffee and shower me with affection.

How do I step back and protect myself from someone who shows affection but won’t commit? Has anyone been in something similar, and did it ever change — or is the healthiest choice to walk away?

things feel less chaotic in my head

Here’s what I did instead of pulling the trigger","I was the guy with the nightstand bottle, the coffee-maker shooters, the office-stall ritual, and the pistol in my hand two years ago.

I wrote the whole ugly story. It’s long. It’s raw. It ends with me still breathing.

If you’re reading this at 3 a.m. wondering if anyone would really be better off without you,  this is for you.

Not selling anything. Just a lower-middle-class dad who’s 687 days sober hoping this lands with one guy who needs it tonight.

Wives and partners, if this sounds like your husband, feel free to forward it.

**I Planned MY Suicide. Then I Killed My Old Life.**

A father’s story of alcoholism, a gun, and a chance at redemption.

There it was. That black shadow with the hissing voice: You’re done. You can’t do this anymore. Some men are winners and then there’s you. Fuck it. End it. Weak words. I don’t mean that they are words of weakness, I mean the words that you are reading on this page are a tiny maggot on the rotten ass of the elephant that was this voice.

I take another swallow of the brown liquid and a shiver lurches through me. As I put the pint-bottle back into my pocket, my mouth waters the way it does when a person might be about to vomit. I open my mouth and let the saliva roll freely over my bottom lip and onto the front of my shirt. I look into the mirror at what I think is me. I blame the sharp lighting in this bathroom for my yellow teeth and the dark, puffy pouches under my nicotine-spit-colored eyes.

I hate myself. Not because I’m a drunk. Not because I shit my pants five-minutes ago and I still haven’t cleaned myself up. No, I hate myself because of the coward in me that needs the drink to function. I hate my fear that other people will see me for what I know that I am. I hate that I’ve ran from things that other men who don’t seem to be too special themselves, have seemingly faced with little difficulty. I hate my unwillingness to try for something more, but I know that it’s all for nothing anyway. Everyone else catches breaks, but not me. I barely feel anything, or I feel too much of everything. There is no in-between.

This is me on the morning of my fortieth birthday, hiding in the bathroom of my house, while my wife and four kids are somewhere on the other side of the door, living their own lives without an inkling that I am contemplating the best way to go to sleep forever.

The thoughts have come and gone in the past three-weeks. That serpent’s lips just behind my ear: *They really will be better off without you. Sure, there will be some pain that goes with losing you, but they’ll get over that. It’s better than the living influence that you have on them now. Hell, one of these days you may end up killing all of you in one drunken car ride. What’s the point of it all? You never follow through with anything. You’ve never won anything. You have no talents. A man should be able to build something. Can you build anything? A man should be able to fix things. Is anything that you touch any better off after you try to mess with it? No.*

This might be a good spot to say something cliché like, “How did I get here?” Or, “How did it all go so wrong?”

But that would be bullshit.

For years I have taken a very specific road that could’ve only led to exactly where I am right now.

I spend every night waking up around 3 a.m., heaving, shaking, and rolling over to clutch whatever bottle I have stashed in the bottom drawer of my nightstand. I violently hold the sloshing bottle against my mouth to spill a couple of slugs down my throat instead of all over my torso. I’m usually good then, to have a smoke and shut my eyes for another two hours before my alarm goes off and it’s time to get ready for work.

Then the day begins…

I sit up and swallow whatever is left of the bottle in my nightstand drawer, and I put the empty pint into my work bag so I can throw it out somewhere on my way to work to avoid the presence of bottles in my trash at home. I shuffle down the hallway into the bathroom and relieve my bladder of its maple-colored contents and make my way to the kitchen.

I pour a cup of coffee and grab two of the four shooters that I have hidden behind the coffee maker. I down the shots using a swallow of coffee as a chaser and bury the empties into the trashcan underneath some used paper plates. I light a cigarette and drop the other two shooters into the pocket of my pajama pants so they will be close at hand when I am in the shower in case I vomit when the hot water and the panicky thoughts about the day ahead hit me. *You’re a fraud. This is NOT how a man acts. How long can you pretend to carry this on?*

Out of the shower and dressed, I brush my teeth making sure it is the last thing I do before I leave the house. (This often makes no difference at all as I may take a shot on my drive into work, in which case I will stop on the backroad on the way in and gargle some of the mouthwash that I keep in the middle console of my truck.)

Every day at the office is a constant act filled with anxiety, shame, and that same voice: *Your last drink was less than two-hours ago. Do you think they can’t smell it on you? Visine might get some of the redness out of your eyes, but they are still puffy and full of fear. You’re not fooling anybody. They’re talking about you in whispers and they think, that you think, that you’re getting away with this. They see you shaking even when you try to camouflage it with other movements , and you can’t deny your oily-red complexion. Trust me, you are not hiding it well.*

I go to the restroom once every two or three-hours, back to the farthest stall from the door, and I guzzle down a shooter or two to quiet some of the nerves and to stave off the inevitable sickness that will come if I do not follow this ritual.

I keep two liquors of choice for the workday:

Fireball-a cheap whiskey with a cinnamon flavor, the scent of which I believe I can cover up with Big Red chewing gum.

Vodka- most drunks choose willful ignorance in the belief that we can cover up the smell of    vodka with just about anything.

Once I have taken my shots in the stall, I put the empty bottles in my pocket, pop some gum or a cough drop, and take care when I walk not to let the empties rattle around and give up my secret. I will make a few trips out to my truck to stash the empties and grab some fresh bottles throughout the day under the guise of grabbing something else such as a pack of smokes or any other excuse I come up with.

The workday having been survived, I start my drive home. I take a two-lane backroad in front of the office that runs parallel to the river where there is a tree-line on one side and a levee on the other. I wait until the office is about the size of a Lego in my rearview mirror and I break out the last two or three shooters and take my first couple of carefree drinks of the day and discard my empty bottles out the window into the tree-line on the roadside.

Lighting a cigarette, inhaling deeply, and exhaling all the stress of the past few hours, I think to myself, *I will drink less tonight and try to get to sleep a little earlier. That way, I’ll have had some decent sleep, even though I’ll wake up somewhere around 3 a.m. again, with my body screaming for a drink.*

I stop at the Pit Stop and grab what I need. A couple of sleeves of shooters and a pint of whiskey should get me through tonight and the workday tomorrow. I make small talk with the cashiers and do my best in the short conversation to act like a regular hard-working guy that is just grabbing some drinks to enjoy casually after work. The clerks are friendly enough, but they know I’m full of shit, and that I’ll be right back in here as soon as I get off tomorrow.

I call my wife on the way home and ask her if she needs anything while I’m out. On the days that she does need me to make a quick stop, I typically use that opportunity to grab a few more drinks, whether it is a half-pint or just a few shooters to rathole somewhere safe should I need them in a pinch. Pulling into my driveway, I pop a cough drop into my mouth and make sure that there are no visible bottles in my truck before going inside.

One of my girls has soccer practice tonight, and my youngest has gymnastics. My wife will take the gymnastics duty, and I agree to take soccer practice since it is held at a fantastic indoor facility that has a bar and grill. I blend in really well there with the majority of parents who also like to have a drink or two while their kid is running around for a couple of hours. It also means that I will not have to worry about reeking like alcohol for the rest of the night as my wife will just chalk it up to me having a couple of drinks at the practice and the few that I will have at home.

Once we are all back at home we have dinner and take our showers. The kids settle into bed, and I pour about three fingers of whiskey into my favorite glass. My wife and I talk to each other about our day and find something to watch on TV for an hour or two. I kiss her goodnight, and shuffle down the hall to the bedroom to lie in bed and scroll on my phone for about an hour before I pass out.

That’s it. Every day is the same.

The only variances may be:

Baseball or basketball practice instead of soccer and gymnastics.

 

Clowning around with the kids for a while.

 

Housework that I have neglected that I will take too long to finish and no doubt piss and

 moan the entire time I’m doing it.

 

Me, ruining whatever show or movie we are watching because I am talking about work, or whatever sadness from my past that I choose to dwell on.

 

Sex with my wife instead of walking to bed alone.

 

Us arguing because of my insecurities and her perceived superiority complex.

 

Me damaging one or all of my children’s sense of security when they see their dad acting like a weak child.

I know that I will die a disgusting, humiliating death if I keep going down this road, but I’m not sure that my mind can take another alcohol cleanse. Ridiculously, this is not the first time that I have found myself in the same desperate spot.

I used to detox myself at home a couple of times a year when things would really get out of control. I guess it just got harder on me with age. I’ve added up countless days and nights of sweating, freezing, sickness, shaking my bones out of my skin, and laying in the cool wet swamp of nausea and toxicity. The feel of the sheets was like smearing Crisco all over my body and pulling dirty clothes on top of it. The voice was always there; not as strong or as often as it seems to be more recently, but there. You’re a worm in mud. I try like hell to focus for just ten seconds on one thing, but the horrific thoughts ricochet like seventeen ping-pong balls in my wooden skull. You’ll never be a man. God, the hallucinations! Hearing music coming from the heating vents in the floors and the oscillating fan in my room. Seeing shadows like ooze and smoke crawling around the walls, and rapid glimpses of movements like small birds and insects just in the corner of my eye. Not to mention the unending cycle of shame and anxiety that goes with staying locked in my room, puking in a trash can while my wife is taking on all the responsibilities of running our home by herself.

People think an alcoholic can quit with just a little bit of willpower, but that’s not it. Hell, even most functioning alcoholics think they know how bad it can get, but until they live it, shit…

I carried on with the above-mentioned routines for years until I finally broke down. One night, eight years ago, I resolved to tell my boss the next morning how I had been living and that I may need to take a few days off to get myself together. He took pity on me and consulted with some of the higher-ups of the company, and they secured me a bed at a local rehab facility. I was immediately sent to detox at a hospital before the rehab would even admit me due to my rattling, my yellow eyes, and sky-high blood pressure.

The medications at the hospital helped with the withdrawals a bit. Slowly getting my appetite back and being pumped full of good nutrients and being surrounded by like-minded people with many of the same afflictions, fears and hopes felt like a Godsend. For that moment in time I didn’t feel so isolated and alone. There were many others battling the same issues as me, but despite my low opinion of myself, I still couldn’t help but feel that my situation was just a little different from most of the others’.

When I got home, things went well for about three months. With a new morning routine, practicing mindfulness, and attending AA meetings a few times a week, things seemed to be getting better. I was a better man for my wife and a better father to my kids. For the most part the cravings and ever-existing triggers were still a daily struggle, but I could shake that shit off. *One day at a time.*

Then, I figured, with my newfound wisdom and coping mechanisms, I would be alright to have an occasional drink or two as long as I was doing it at appropriate times. A few drinks at get-togethers, or after work, turned into a few more, turned into a couple of whiskey shots with my coffee in the morning, then a couple more swallows just a few hours later, and so on, and spiral. Things carried on the same way for another six years until I had another breakdown and was fired from my job for “performance and attendance issues”.

That brings us right back to me being hunched over, leaning with both palms on either side of my sink, staring at the golem in the mirror crying, knowing that I am going to kill myself. I thought of driving my truck into the river, hanging myself, or jumping off the nearby bluffs, but I saw a flaw with each one of those methods. *You might not die if you drive into the river. You’re too much of a pussy to hang yourself. Jumping off the bluffs might leave you as a vegetable, but still living.*

A couple of days later, I was about as sick as I’d ever remembered being. I was wobbling like a baby deer and unable to keep any food down. From past experiences I knew that the hospital would be of no help to me as they had refused to admit me before due to smelling like alcohol, or answering “yes” when one of the nurses asked me if I drank more than occasionally. So I went to an Urgent Care located a few blocks from my house, and they looked me over and told me that I had pneumonia. I picked up the steroids and other medications that I was prescribed, mainly to show my wife that I must be legitimately sick if the doctor says I need meds. I went home to pack a bag and to tell my family that I was heading out to my dad’s house in the country to avoid spreading my sickness to them. I backed out of the driveway and drove down my street watching my youngest daughter waving in my rearview and knowing in my soul that I was going to shoot myself in the head back in the woods behind my father’s house.

Since you’re reading this, I guess there’s no need to tell you what I didn’t do. So I’ll tell you what I did. I drove to my dad’s house and talked with him. I told him about my having pneumonia and that I was quitting drinking. Then, I waited until he was out the next day, and I opened the drawer where he kept one of his pistols. I saw that the magazine was missing from the pistol, and I checked for a round in the chamber. I sat and thought for a few long minutes. I wondered if my father had suspected something and if that was why the magazine wasn’t in the pistol as it had been any other time. I thought about my family carrying on without me. I thought about how long I had felt so alone.

I made one phone call. They didn’t answer. I staggered out to the front porch and stared at the field across the road. My phone rang. I spoke honestly and didn’t hold back anything. The voice on the other end didn’t offer much sympathy, but they spoke these simple truths:

You’re not alone.

You’re isolating yourself, and only you really know why.

 Even the ones that don’t like you very much right now still love you, and they want you to do better.

 The ones that don’t want you to do better don’t matter.

 Nobody that loves you would be better off without you.

 Stop breaking their hearts, and yours will start to heal as well.

 It’s not weak to reach for help.

This is my call to the dad out there that may be going through something similar. You, man. Life is brutal, and it doesn’t come with a playbook for rough years. We are supposed to be the protectors and the providers, but when we’re locked inside ourselves, it makes it nearly impossible to give the necessary attention to our outside worlds. We might compare ourselves to our heroes and get stuck on ways that we don’t measure up, but remember that our heroes have their weak moments, too. If you constantly compare your inside to everyone’s outside, you’re gonna see some of the worst of you in contrast with some of the best of others.

In the last month, I've noticed strange behavior: sometimes (two or three times out of ten), when I turn it on, when it should be rinsing, I instead hear a very quiet pumpin sound (it's present in the audio in this video, but I doubt it's audible enough), but no water flows. I suspect it could simply be a clog, but there are no problems during normal coffee brewing. I couldn't find any valves that could be activated during rinsing—the idea that the rinsing valve itself is clogged has been nagging me—but there are no valves. I thought maybe the electric current during rinsing is lower and the pump is not powerful enough, but this pump is supplied directly by 220V, and there's no PWM control. I replaced the pump, but it didn't help.

Summary: sometimes there's no water when rinsing, but the pump pumps (very quiet sounds), but there are no problems brewing coffee. Anyone have any ideas what that could be?

A colleague of mine did an ayahuasca retreat in June (two ceremonies back-to-back), and he ran pre/post brain scans to see whether anything measurable would show up. 

Here’s the setup:

**• Pre-scan:** June 6th at 13:28  
He doesn’t remember exactly how he felt, but nothing unusual stood out.

**• Two ceremonies:** nights of June 6th and 7th  
A lot of emotional release, no caffeine for a week, long nights, and what he described as a lifetime of information surfacing.

**• Post-scan:** June 8th at 21:12  
He said he felt surprisingly calm and regulated, even after a day of running errands right after leaving the retreat.  
  
  
Seems like the most noticeable change is a drop in frontal high-beta, the “tension/effort” wave, and a small shift in peak alpha frequency (8 Hz to 9 Hz). Nothing dramatic, but interesting.

1p83yqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_6EvieJoy9/comments/1p83yqo/transparency_the_er_and_psych_ward/,Transparency: The ER and Psych Ward,"A week ago I was ""deep in it"" with the ""Bi-polar"" switching between grounded reality and infinite metaphor. I had focused in on one path of metaphor comparing with grounded reality and created some friction between myself and that grounded reality.

Like in the movie Inception, when one becomes the architect of their inner reality, their external perceptual reality can ""look back"" and ""resist"". There is no resistance to ""law"" (grounded reality within the bounds of common knowledge), but there is great resistance to ""parallel"" delusion.

Last week it was the parallel delusion that won the toss and it culminated in an answered question and my subsequent ""vacation"" :) to the psych ward.

This is important. Here is my story.

I became concerned that the behavior of my family was concealing a deeper truth that I needed an answer to - having to do with time, space, and personality. I reached out to family and friends that I had previously gone ""no contact"" with, and the responses from those members were coherent with the flow of the experience... They did not seem perturbed.

Those in my direct physical experience, however, were spiraling in a panic as I felt calm within an ""eye of the storm"" feeling.

While parked and waiting for a definitive answer to arrive, my husband took my vehicle keys and called the police. I requested my keys and didn't receive so I called as well for a personal advocate. It was interesting to me to interact with those that I had previously deemed immoral. Every interaction felt safe and comfortable, even though I initially gravitated toward those I'd previously deemed ""misfits"".

I drove back home and began to clean the house. Now with my answer received, all that felt left was to restore order and move forward.

However, having not resolved the panic of those in the grounded state, the ""karma"" eventually returned. First, several police officers arrived to talk with me as I was continuing to clean. I invited them in as I don't hide anything of myself. After talking a while I asked them to leave so I could continue my tasks. A few hours later my husband brought them back.

They came into my bedroom where I was drinking coffee and folding laundry. They told me they were going to take me somewhere and I told them I would not go anywhere as I was where I wanted to be.

It seems as though it is illegal to be where you are if someone else does not want you to be there with them in a legally shared abode. I didn't know that.

They handcuffed me without any resistance on my part. I'd wished I'd taken one more sip of coffee and one more vape :)

What an undignified thing to presume one should do to someone.

I was treated kindly and my coat was draped over my shoulders. My husband was inconsolable in the kitchen with other officers. I allowed him to hug me and I told him it would be ok. I do not forgive the action, but I do forgive the man. He was directly influenced by my mother, who I had mistakenly shared too much burden with and who was unable to bear it with me, so they went down together. I do not forgive my mother's choice, but I forgive my mother.

I was placed in an SUV to wait uncomfortably, finding ways to shift and sit on my hands on the very hard seat. Once the officers got in the vehicle, they were kind and commiserating.

They drove me to Skyline, and brought me to an emergency room where a doctor that had, (no joke) a Doctor Robotnik mustache, questioned me heavily and personally. I honestly answered that the reason I felt this came to this ultimate culmination was not only my delusional thinking, but my husband's refusal to accept my desire for open marriage due to resistance of physical expectation within the marriage itself. I think it felt like rejection and with us both owning our home, there was no where for him to retreat and so the action became to kick me out. I do not forgive the action, I forgive the man.

They brought me to a hallway full of closed doors with a lock up area of people observing and declaring their sole authority of the floor. They had me strip and change in front of them. My room was the size of a walk-in closet, very bare (a medical bed, unplugged, a thin blanket, a fitted sheet, a flat pillow, and a giant tv turned on LOUD on cartoons. The room was near unbearably cold and the gown I was given was very thin and stiff with difficult to manage buttons on the back of it that regularly came unsnapped.

I immediately requested the TV to be turned off in my closet, and it was done, but other TVs were on in rooms around me, very loud. As I was admitted due to hearing metaphor in the things around me, this seemed to either be the height of insensitivity or something more purposeful. Along with the loud TVs, every person I heard brought in was heavily distraught and yelling obscenities. I curled under my blanket shivering with my fingers in my ears. They remarked on it.

We could leave our rooms to ask questions, request things like water, and go to the bathroom. Doors had to be closed immediately when entering or exiting any room. The bathroom door was only a middle portion of the door and everything inside could be seen. A shower with no curtain was available in the most visible part of the bathroom. I was given uncomfortable socks with no ""heel"" that I was required to wear when out of my room.

The coercion to take medicine without understanding what it was for or agreeing to it was heavy handed. Freedom was dangled as a reward for simply doing what was told. My time felt extended due to refusing until I had all of the information.

They very oddly provided me with a phone and my schizophrenic Aunt Joy's number who I hadn't talked with since Uni. She also attempted coercion and I cut her off, again.

Once I received the information I was satisfied with, I took the medication and we moved on... this time, to be fully strapped and restrained on a stretcher, with my wrists pulled taut and my ankles immovable. Why? They said it was for my safety in the ambulance ride to Parthenon Pavilion.

Also I wanted to note, I have a verified past history of having been raped, multiple times. I was transported by two men. I don't forgive the action, I forgive the men.",1,1764254811.0,u_6EvieJoy9,0,1.0,False

Travelled in Vietnam for a week with my roommate/ bestfried. all was well with nights out until a few nights ago. 

we met these aussie guys and headed to another bar. I went to the bathroom with my friend and when I came back to the table my beer was gone, and instead a shot was in its place. the guy I was talking to said he drank my beer and bought the shot. I didn’t think much about it, as I was already a bit drunk and did not even clock that it was a random shot and had no idea what alcohol it was. I did the shot and immediately started seeing double. went back to the hostel and was vomiting all night, it felt like my stomach was burning up and I seriously thought I wasn’t gonna make it and would need  to get my stomach pumped. luckily morning came and I took myself downstairs for coffee. worst headache of my life. my body wasn’t happy as I fell sick after (runny nose, fever etc). 

has this happened to anyone else? are shots a no-no in Asia?   
I did shots in Europe with no issues before so it didn’t cross my mind. ",0,1764254587.0,femaletravels,2,0.25,False

I point out that American coffee is not that, but rather an espresso with water added, and he ends up agreeing with me. 

I wonder what would happen if I didn't know much about the subject and simply asked the question. I suppose I would accept his answer without question, which makes me doubt the rest of the answers he gives me on subjects I don't know much about.",4,1764254553.0,lumo,7,0.83,False

1p83sn6,https://youtu.be/WETzhm0N9G8?si=s_kNrcPw1u2juRIu,The Rolling Stones-TILL THE NEXT GOODBYE-1974-Take a GOOD look at Micks eyes!,"""Till the Next Goodbye"" by The Rolling Stones is about 

a melancholy, bittersweet love affair that is full of longing and the inability to find comfort in temporary distractions. The song's meaning is rooted in the bittersweet nature of a love that is cyclical, with ""goodbyes"" that are temporary, and the lingering feeling of a past love that cannot be forgotten. The lyrics depict a yearning for a connection that can't be fulfilled by mundane things, like food or remedies, and takes place in settings like coffee shops and movie theaters. 

* **Bittersweet love:** The song portrays a relationship that is poignant and has elements of both love and disappointment. The lyrics show a longing for connection but also a sense of being unable to fully satisfy that desire.
* **Cyclical nature of goodbyes:** The title itself emphasizes that the goodbyes are not final, but part of a cycle of meeting and parting. The song reflects on a past love that continues to linger even through temporary distractions.
* **Melancholy atmosphere:** With its acoustic guitar intro and country influences, the song creates a melancholic mood that fits the theme of a love that is both tender and tinged with sadness.
* **Yearning for more:** The lyrics, such as ""I don't need no fancy food and I don't need no fancy wine; And I sure don't need the tears you cry,"" show the narrator's desire for something more substantial than what is available, indicating a deeper sense of dissatisfaction.
* **Focus on the mundane:** The song's narrative is grounded in ordinary places like coffee shops and movie theaters, which highlights the contrast between the grand feelings of love and the mundane reality in which they exist. ",3,1764254366.0,OldSchoolCoolMusic,0,1.0,False

My partner uses earbuds to listen to the tv while falling asleep and I’m looking for some to help me too with my own sleep needs. 

This feels so niche but if anyone can help me, it’s Reddit!

Budget and location - 
up to 300, i’m in the US in a city

How the gear will be used - 

primarily for soft meditations from the Calm app, soothing background noise. Ideally they’re relatively comfortable for back and side sleeping (don’t kill when I turn my head and have my ear on my soft pillow. 

Ideally I could also use them during the day for work meetings at the house or a coffee shop. But it’s ok if not. 

What I’ve tried in the past-
I’ve had the headband open ear headphones but I have curly hair and they mess it up and I don’t want to shower every morning to fix it. Plus not washing the headband is not my favorite. (My dog always tries to steal and chew on it)

I’ve tried Shokz OpenRun Pro2. But the stiff band in the back is no fun for sleep and it hurts my ears when I turn on the side or the tops of my ears after extended use (which I think is from my hair pulling down the back band). Otherwise I love the sound and how it works for my meetings or music.

Wirecutter had some ideas: https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-bone-conduction-headphones/

1p83oq3,https://i.redd.it/ejgopp669t3g1.jpeg,Rabid Mary [Rewritten Creepypasta],"Mary doesn't have a mouth. She does. She just can't use it when she is required to. All that would come out would be faint, gentle whispers or a low tone of voice. And sometimes Mary's voice would simply get caught inside of her throat when she would make try to speak. Mary doesn't have any friends. Mary lived alone.  But Mary had Jed. An unknown black spider that happened to share a room with her. He often comes out from behind her curtains to visit her at night. Sometimes Mary was even allowed to pet him. Jed's company was always something special to her.

But one day, Mary came home and her front door was already unlocked. Who had her access to her house if she had the keys? Luckily for Mary, nothing was stolen or touched. But Jed's body was brutally mutilated on the floor. A giant puddle of blood covering Mary's floor in her room. Mary didn't cry. She simply disposed of his scattered body parts. Dying her hair black and wearing only black attire so she could still keep his presence flowing through her afterwards. It was certainly a bit much, But at the end of the day, Mary never had anyone else.

One day after work, when Mary was leaving she saw a 7 ft tall man wearing a white rabbit costume watching her from the bushes. Mary quickly left the area and drove home.

The next day she was making herself a warm cup of coffee before dumping it immediately into the sink. Mary wasn't that thirsty anyway.

She put on her black trenchcoat and opened the door before finding a basket on the ground in front of her. There was a letter as well but Mary had crunched it up and put it aside for now.

She opened up the basket and inside were a bunch of rabbits.

Mary immediately froze. Out of fear, She started stomping on each of them as hard as she could until her heels were completely bloodied.

Mary wiped her heels clean and drove back to her workplace again.

When Mary had got there it was busy. More busy than usual. Important day probably.

""Late again, Are we?"" Mary's boss said when she came in.

She looked at him blankly before whispering.
""Yes..."" There it was.

""I want you here earlier from now on. Understood?"" He said to her sternly.

Again. Another whisper.
""Sure...""

""You look pretty, Mary."" He said before walking off.

""Thanks..."" Mary said quietly under her breath.

Mary got back to her office and left once again when her shift was finished.

When Mary got back she found another letter and basket left by her front door. This time she opened the letter. Anxiety slowly building up inside of her as she did so.

It simply read as follows.
""I see you.""

Mary's blood ran cold. Who was watching her from her house? Who could see her? And where could they see her?

""Don't... H-Hurt... Me..."" Mary stated with as much loudness as she could, Her words getting caught in her throat as she tried to speak.

Mary could smell the rotting scent coming from the basket. She wouldn't dare open it and see what was inside.

This caused Mary very intense fear that over the next few days she was forced to wait for the white rabbit to show up. Ignoring work. Standing in front of the front door 24/7. Waiting.

Eventually, It did show up. And instead of dropping a note he came straight for her when he saw her waiting for him by the front door.

Mary didn't move an inch. She was paralyzed the whole time just from waiting. Her skin was now pale like the snow and her cheeks looked slightly more thinner than before. The white rabbit then took off it's mask and revealed itself to her. His body just barely an inch away from hers.

""Dad...?"" Mary said, feeling like screaming even though her mouth wouldn't let her.

""Hey, Sweetheart. Did you miss your beloved father?"" He said. As if he knew Mary didn't feel comfortable at all with him being there.

""You... You're my... Tormentor..."" Mary delicately added before continuing.

""Get... Get... Get out..."" Mary whispered. Her voice barely audible as she looked up at him.

He put back on his mask again before patting her head and then leaving.

Still frozen with fear, Mary swung open her front door to stop her jerking movements and quickly picked up the letter she had previously crunched up.

It reads as follows.
""Hi, Honey. It's me, your father. I know you hate me, but I thought you should know I've always loved you no matter what happened between us. I thought I'd bring you some rabbits. Your favourite."" From The Easter Bunny.

And just like that, All the memories came flooding back to her.

One year later, Mary finally got herself a partner and shared a brand new home with him.

Max, Her partner. Noticed Mary zoning out a lot of the time. Occasionally crying at random times during day, and waking up with tears in her eyes. Max always asked if she was okay whenever she cried. And Mary always responded with-

""I love you, Baby."" Mary said in a very soothing tone. A reassuring tone that often eased Max's concerns and worries about her.

This night was different however.
Max was sleeping in early due to having worked all day today at his shift. Max wasn't aware of it yet, But Mary was already consuming him starting from his feet up.

By the next morning, Max finally awoke with only his head and his chest remaining. Max was confused, He should've been dead. But he turned his head and noticed some ominous injections laying on the table beside him.

Probably what was keeping him alive for so long.

When Mary finally returned to him, she smiled. Mary's face was unrecognisable. Her eye sockets were stretched and where her eyes should be were now replaced with an empty void of darkness. Black. Empty. And she wore a pair of rabbit ears on her head.

Mary spoke. Answering Max's question before it was even uttered.

""The rabbits. They call me their queen. They pray. And they pray to me. They do not hurt. But they love. And they love me. My dear beloved children will save the rest of you for later when the harvest begins. For they are but satisfied for now.""

I need a quick sanity check on whether these beans are acceptable or not (roast isn't mine)

Out of 170g, about 7g are deformed  
The coffee is supposedly scored 87 SCA, but cupping demonstrates a quality that is nowhere near that  
  
Most (\~80%) of the suspicious beans look like the bottom one. Almost like they ruptured from the inside

1p83l8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_pulze3d/comments/1p83l8l/renderflow_11/,RenderFlow 1.1,"Version 1.1 brings visual improvements, software analytics, user groups, and granular access control for larger teams.

Let's dive into the details:

# Updated Look

The user interface is one of the most subjective topics, and we've received many comments and suggestions. While we're grateful for all the ideas, we can't fulfil every request.

We improved overall UI readability by fine-tuning contrast and colors. We also made subtle changes to tables and selection states, and added more color to status and priority elements.

[RenderFlow job list and details](https://preview.redd.it/pzijzpz48t3g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0219259b886de564850d10082e83a56b942f530)

We like it so much that we made dark mode the default, we hope everyone agrees.

We made important changes to the Quick Controls in the top right corner. Node mode now has a dedicated toggle button, so you can activate or disable it with one click. We moved all other settings to a dropdown where you can change pool, switch server, start spawner mode, or adjust your CPU affinity.

[Updated quick controls](https://preview.redd.it/oxifyof28t3g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ca0386599a022da608f97967c13c2dd763b9b09)

For dedicated render nodes, we created a new interface layout that shows only the essentials: hardware, network, and benchmark data, essential controls, access to logs, and the current job. From now just like in Render Manager you won’t be able to submit jobs or monitor progress from a dedicated render node.

[New node mode user interface](https://preview.redd.it/f1b2km508t3g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa4d035c6f6c303f8c4c72b0e755e968142adfa0)

# Granular Access Controls

Studios have been asking for granular access control and user groups since the initial release. We've been working on this a lot and we are exited to finally show it.

By default, RenderFlow creates two user groups: one for the Admin (the user where RenderFlow server is running) and a User group for everyone else.

[Create groups and assign users](https://preview.redd.it/u7hdb18y7t3g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a517ea56adbfb08fe68fcfa9e9a34656c1d3cd3e)

You can create new groups for your artists, leads, and admins, and assign different rules and policies to them. For each group, you can control who can edit jobs, run commands, view statistics, change system settings, and many more. For most policies, you can define the level of control:

* None: the feature will be hidden or disabled for everyone
* Own: allow the feature for the users own node and jobs
* Group: allow the feature for all nodes and jobs in the same user group or pool
* Everyone: allow the feature for every user without restrictions

[Policies per user group](https://preview.redd.it/l8eq4f4w7t3g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49c000d7d187fcbcb502e036d5141a2ff8fd8acd)

# Software Analytics

Our beloved feature from Render Manager is back and it’s even more powerful. While node details give you a great overview of the installed 3D apps and plugins, RenderFlow previously had no way to compare them. In the new software analytics page, we list all the installed apps and plugins across connected computers. You can select a base computer, and others will be compared against it, showing which plugins are installed or missing, making it easy to spot differences.

\[TODO\]

[Compare apps and plugins](https://preview.redd.it/xl1dzolt7t3g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14850d019fc679b3325146455578b8b7a8b393d5)

# User Requests

Beyond the larger features, we also included smaller improvements requested by our customers.

Some of our customers reached out that they would like to monitor their farms with RenderFlow and place it on a dedicated screen or TV. The only problem was that RenderFlow closes the user interface after 15 minutes of idle time to save resources, making it less useful as the information always disappeared after a coffee break. In the latest version, we added an option in Settings > Appearances to disable this.

[Disable Auto-close on Idle](https://preview.redd.it/gj8lex7s7t3g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3a17dc54c9fb4057b7f5fe7f008f771c44d8871)

One of our Discord members pointed out that tiled rendering options weren't available for Scene Manager. We missed that in the last update but from now on, this won't be a problem.

[Scene Manager Tiled rendering option](https://preview.redd.it/5pwyytjr7t3g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aad6dea0b15d281322dc62619f5f5bc4fb9d779f)

Another Discord member is a heavy user of RenderFlow's Spawner mode, which lets you fire up Corona DR (or V-Ray Spawner) on selected nodes and use them within Corona DR jobs or outside of RenderFlow. From now on, you can also schedule the start and stop of Spawner mode through the Scheduler.

[Schedule when spawner mode starts or stops](https://preview.redd.it/mrtl85wq7t3g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66659991649319d8cb34c099060b9ef5a31879b0)

Another request was to add the option to filter by tag. In earlier versions, we introduced tagging nodes, then recently batch tagging. Now we've added filter by tag to the nodes section, as well as filtering nodes or jobs by pool.

[Filter nodes by tag](https://preview.redd.it/ow4yas4q7t3g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d875a81bce5c2e635a8c5a14223e1c1b0e7c28e)

# What's Next?

With these updates, we have all the remaining essential features and a very strong foundation to continue building.

The next step is to add support for Maya, Nuke, Houdini, and Unreal, make it compatible with Linux, and extend our API and scripting capabilities so RenderFlow can be integrated into any pipeline.

1p83jb9,https://v.redd.it/xdt3p9z08t3g1,Ariana not getting enough sleep,"Maybe it might seem like a trivial topic, but recently this interview caught my attention, where she immediately and without any hesitation said that she doesn’t sleep 8 hours a day. It reminded me of another interview where she mentioned she’s leaves for work at 5:30 am, and yet she tries to wake up even earlier to get some steps, and drinks another coffee instead of napping. Cynthia also mentioned in a different interview that she would wake up at 2 am to work out for 2 h, and during the filming of Wicked, she sometimes slept only 2-3 h a night. I think we can assume the same applies to Ariana. I don’t understand how such extreme dedication could actually serve any purpose. Personally, I would perform much better if I were well-rested rather than training hard after only two hours of sleep. I’m only 22, and I already can’t function properly if I don’t get at least six hours of sleep. I can’t comprehend how women in their thirties can work physically and mentally for long hours every day without sleep, though of course there are some theories ❄️

However, the interview where Ariana said she doesn’t sleep 8h took place after filming Wicked, and throughout her career we can see her almost always with a cup of coffee, which gives the impression that lack of sleep is something natural for her. This makes it even more ironic, that she constantly talks about healing while not taking care of herself in such a basic way. 

My theory is that her workaholism, lack of sleep, eating disorder, and obsession with her appearance are all connected, possibly due to a deeply rooted personality issue that drives her to always work as much as possible, sleep and eat as little as possible, look perfect, sing the highest, and be “the best” at everything, regardless of whether it’s actually good for her or whether it comes at the expense of her health, like an overachieving kid.

One task was to try a few website builders and pretend I was someone who wanted to start a small shop, then write a report about how smooth the whole flow was. The checklist was crazy detailed. From login, to how I ask questions, to button colors, everything needed a score.

That afternoon I kept jumping between a few platforms. First I tried a drag and drop one, then a template based one, then a tool where you type one sentence and it spins up a full site. I made up a tiny side project selling used books and coffee beans, threw it into a service like genstore, and in two minutes I had a site where you could click into the cart. I was taking screenshots and filling tables and at some point I realised the client cared less about “does anyone actually use this site” and more about “does the report look neat.”

These jobs do not pay much and the process feels very mechanical. In the end I found myself questioning not the tools, but how many people now work just to help someone else tick KPI boxes.

If this was any other day prior to taking the medication, I would’ve been ravenous from the second I woke up which would result in me scarfing down a BEC on an egg bagel along with a corn muffin and iced coffee. 

This morning is a completely different story. I’m barely hungry if at all. I had a nutrigrain bar around 7:30am and a glass of water. No shakes, no hunger pains, or being hangry at my wife & kids. Just feeling fine. Is this all in my head? I’m sure some of it is. Just wasn’t expecting to feel “not hungry” so quickly after first dose. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience?

Photos 1 & 2, the darker girl, is the new one. She came to me named Shadow, and I renamed her to Maple. The issue is my other cat, photos 3 & 4, also a tortie, is named Mocha and I keep calling them each other's name & I feel bad. The matchy-matchy names is cute but I'm considering changing Maple to something that doesn't start with M.

Miss Maple is a little spicy. She'll attack my feet when I'm in bed, and has no problem (gently) biting me if I'm too slow to get breakfast or it she isn't vibing with the attention I'm giving her. She has beautiful green eyes, and some reddish tones in some of her fur. She is pretty vocal, as is Mocha. Generally sassy, whereas Mocha is more chill.

I was considering Haring, in honor of Keith Haring, or maybe Roxie, like Roxie Hart in Chicago. I ideally want a two syllable name, maybe coffee or art related. I did consider Matcha, due to her eyes, but then they both still have M names.
