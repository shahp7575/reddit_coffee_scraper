And then, there was only one more that day. A slow day indeed.

Near the end of my shift, the door chimed softly, and in walked my landlady.

Her cart was heavy—groaning under the weight of groceries piled high. Milk cartons, fresh chicken wrapped in butcher paper, boxes of cereal, jars of preserves, bundles of herbs, and more. One by one, she unloaded the items onto the long, old-fashioned table in front of me.
I packed diligently, folding paper bags and filling them with her goods, counting as I went. Twelve bags in total, large and bulging.

I glanced nervously at the spreadsheet pinned behind me, the familiar parchment curling at the edges. Scanning the handwritten list, I found an entry titled Large Grocery Shopping.

There it was:

>1-10 bags — friend
>10+ bags — pet

I cleared my throat, my voice barely steady. “Um, Mrs. Shirley… I see you’ve got over ten bags here.”

She gave me a slow, knowing smile—one that didn’t quite reach her eyes.

“By the way,” I asked, watching her arrange the last few bags in her cart, “What’s your name? Since I’m renting from you, I figured I should know.”

The old woman smiled, soft and grandmotherly, her hands folding over the cart handle with ease. “I’m Mrs. Shirley,” she said, with a warmth that briefly softened the weight in the air.

I nodded politely, then glanced back toward the register. Time to finish the transaction.

“To complete the payment today,” I said, my voice steadier than I expected, “Please answer this: What was your childhood pet?”

She blinked in surprise. “My pet?”

I smiled, just a little. “That’s what the register wants.”

She looked thoughtful for a moment, and then said, “Bird.”

Nothing.

The register remained dark.

I hesitated, then asked, “What was their name?”

Her eyes lit up slightly. “I named him Feathers.”

Ding.

A soft red light pulsed on the display. Payment accepted.

“Perfect,” I said, forcing a bit of cheer into my voice. “Have a great day, Mrs. Shirley.”

She gave me a small, satisfied nod, then slowly pushed her cart out of the store, her steps quiet, almost reverent. As the door shut behind her with a hollow click, the store fell silent again.

I exhaled and slumped forward, resting my head on the counter. A low groan escaped my lips, partly from exhaustion, partly from the quiet weight of too much strangeness and not enough understanding.

I stared at the flickering number 2 on the register.

It was still glowing.

But there were no customers in sight.

And yet… I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone—or something—was still waiting to be served.

I flinched as a throat cleared behind me. I hadn’t even heard him approach.

Mr. Stanstman stood just over my shoulder, hands folded neatly in front of him, his usual too-wide smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.

“You did well there,” he said. “You successfully processed a payment on your own.”

His tone was calm, but something about the way he said processed made the hair on my neck rise.

He glanced toward the dark windows. “It’s getting late, and it doesn’t seem like anyone else is coming. Go home.”

Relief washed over me, chased quickly by a rumble from my stomach. I hadn’t eaten since morning. The thought of food pulled me back to something more human, more grounded.

“Yeah,” I mumbled, lifting my head from the counter, “that’s a good idea.”

I remembered passing a small diner just down the road—a squat little building with a flickering neon sign that read Mabel’s in faded pink letters. I had wanted to try it since arriving.

With a flick of the switch beneath the register, I powered off the number box. The glowing yellow 1 faded into nothing, a quiet signal to the unseen: Closed.

I hung the apron on its hook, grabbed my coat, and stepped out into the cool evening air.

Behind me, the grocery store stood still—quiet and dark. But I swore, just as the door closed, I heard the faint hum of the register come back to life.

Only for a second.

The walk to the diner was short—just ten minutes along the quiet road that wound through the heart of the small town. The air was cool and still, the kind of stillness that made you feel watched, even when the street was empty.

The diner stood like a time capsule from the 1950s: chrome trim, flickering neon signs, and wide frosted windows glowing with warm yellow light. As I stepped inside, a small bell above the door gave a cheerful ding, announcing my arrival.

A short, blonde woman in her mind 30's turned at the sound. She wore a crisp, pale blue uniform with white trim—classic, old-fashioned. Her name tag read Mabel, though the letters were worn nearly to dust.

“Evenin',” she said, smiling in a way that seemed practiced but not unfriendly. “Sit wherever you like.”

I chose a booth near the window, the plastic seat creaking softly as I slid into it. She followed close behind and handed me a menu—just a single laminated sheet with a few pictures and a short list of classic meals: burgers, grilled cheese, eggs any style, pie.

My eyes instinctively scanned the page for prices.

And I sighed in relief.

Actual numbers. Five dollars. Eight-fifty.

No cryptic trades. No questions. Just ordinary food, for ordinary money.

At least… I hoped.

Mabel waited patiently by the table, pen poised above her notepad.

“Know what you’d like?” she asked.

I looked up at her, suddenly aware of how tired I was, how empty my stomach felt, and how strange my day had been.

“Something simple,” I said. ""A cheeseburger, fries, and a sweet tea"" —simple, familiar, grounding.

As the waitress disappeared behind the counter, I let my eyes wander across the diner, scanning for anything unusual. The lighting buzzed faintly above, flickering once in a way that was probably just old wiring. The booths were worn but clean, the floor scuffed from years of footsteps, and a soft hum played from the old jukebox in the corner—some sleepy jazz instrumental, the kind meant to fill silence without drawing attention.

Everything seemed normal.

Aside from me, there was only one other customer: a man seated at the very back, hunched over a chipped mug of coffee. His eyes were distant, staring down into the dark liquid as though it held some kind of answer. He hadn’t moved since I walked in—not a sip, not a shift in posture.

I looked away quickly, unsure why he unsettled me so much. Maybe it was just the day I’d had.

Lost in thought, I didn't even notice the waitress return until I caught the clink of ceramic on formica.

She had set my plate down in front of me with quiet efficiency: the cheeseburger steaming, the fries golden and crisp, a tall glass of sweet tea beading with condensation. The smell hit me then—grilled meat, toasted bread, and the faint metallic tinge of ketchup. Comfort food.

“Here you go, sugar,” she said, her voice soft and honey-thick. “Eat up while it’s hot.”

I nodded, offering a quiet “Thanks,” It looked perfect.

Her blue eyes settled on me with a flicker of curiosity, and without asking, she slid into the booth across from me.

Uninvited, but not unwelcome—at least not yet.

“Hm?” I mumbled around a mouthful of fries, blinking in surprise.

She smiled—bright, youthful, but not without a hint of something unreadable beneath it. “You’re new in town,” she said. “I’ve never seen you before. It’s a small place. I know everyone.”

I nodded, wiping my mouth with a napkin and straightening up a bit. “Yeah, just arrived a couple of days ago. I’m Marie.”

“Ashley,” she replied, giving a small wave. “I’ve been here for… years, I think. As far as I can remember.”

Something about the way she said it made me pause. As far as I can remember.

“Oh?” I offered casually. “Must be nice, working here at the diner.”

She tilted her head, considering. “It has its moments,” she said, then her gaze sharpened. “You work at the grocery store, don’t you?”

I nodded slowly. “Yeah. Just started today, actually. Came here for a fresh start.”

“Fresh starts,” she repeated softly, almost like she was tasting the words. Then she smiled again. “Those are rare here.”

I gave a short, awkward laugh. “What about you? What brought you here?”

Ashley tapped her bottom lip with a finger, thoughtful. “Quiet,” she said at first. “To focus on my music.”

A beat.

Then she frowned, eyes narrowing slightly.

“I… play the piano. I think.”

The words left her mouth like she wasn’t quite sure of them—as if she were reciting from someone else’s memory.

My stomach twisted, just slightly. She thinks she plays?

“You think?” I echoed gently, trying not to let my concern show too much.

She blinked, clearly startled by her own uncertainty. “Yeah. I used to practice every day. But now, I’m not sure where my piano is.” She gave a small, almost apologetic laugh. “Weird, right?”

I studied her for a moment. There was nothing overtly strange about her. She looked real. Solid. Her hair was tucked behind one ear, and her hands rested easily on the table.

But something about her felt… faded. Like a person in a photograph left out in the sun too long.

I brushed off the oddness, blaming it on hunger more than anything else. My stomach growled insistently, pulling me back to the warmth of the plate in front of me.

“Sorry,” I said with a sheepish gesture toward my food. “Starving.”

Ashley seemed to take the hint. She gave me a gentle nod, her expression unreadable, and quietly slid out of the booth. Without another word, she walked to the far end of the diner and disappeared behind a set of swinging doors, her footsteps light as breath.

Alone again, I dug in.

The meal was delicious—comforting, familiar. The burger was juicy, the fries crisp and perfectly salted. The sweet tea was cold and just the right kind of sweet, like something brewed from an old family recipe. It was the first real meal I’d had since arriving, and somehow, that made it taste even better.

When I finished, I wiped my hands, dropped a few bills on the table, and stood up to leave. No questions. No lights flashing red.

Just… a meal.

As I stepped outside, the cool evening air greeted me like a quiet sigh. The town was cloaked in soft darkness now, the streetlamps flickering to life one by one. I zipped my jacket and began the short walk back to the house.

It was one of the few blessings here—everything was within walking distance. That meant I didn’t have to touch the dwindling fuel in my van or the thin stack of bills in my wallet.

But even as I walked, enjoying the silence, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted.

Maybe it was Ashley.

Maybe it was the look in her eyes when she talked about her piano.

Or maybe it was just this town—too quiet, too still, like it was holding its breath.

The sun was slipping below the trees as I reached my house, casting long shadows across the street in warm, bruised hues of orange and violet. On the porch next door, my landlady—Mrs. Shirley—was gently rocking on a wooden swing, the chains creaking softly in rhythm with the breeze.

I raised a hand in greeting. “Hi there, Shirley. Enjoying the sunset?”

She turned her head slowly, as though pulled from a trance, and blinked in surprise at the sight of me. “Oh! Hello, dear. Yes, it’s lovely this evening, isn’t it?”

I walked over to her, leaning casually against the porch rail, trying to be friendly. “Do you live alone over here? No partner or pets?” I asked, hoping to make small talk and maybe learn a bit more about her. The question came out light, innocent.

She paused.

Her eyes drifted toward the empty window behind her before returning to me.

“No,” she said, voice warm but distant. “It’s just me now. I’m not much of a pet person.”

I gave a soft hum, keeping my tone neutral. “Huh. That’s funny—I thought you said you had a pet growing up.”

A flicker passed through her expression—so fast I might’ve imagined it. A twitch at the corner of her eye, a moment’s stiffness in her hands as they rested in her lap.

Then she smiled again. “Oh, did I? Well, I suppose I must’ve. People remember the strangest things, don’t they?”

She resumed her slow swinging, the chains creaking once more like a lullaby slightly out of tune.

I smiled politely, though my mind was already turning.

Because I remembered exactly what she said.

A bird named Feathers.

And the register had accepted it.

The soft scraping of her slippers against the wooden porch broke the silence.

“Well,” she said, rising slowly, “good night, dear. It’s late, and I’m tired from my day in town.”

Before I could respond, she shuffled to her door and slipped inside. The front door clicked shut behind her, a gentle but final sound that seemed to echo a little too long in the quiet air.

I stood there for a moment, alone again, staring at her darkened windows.

How could she forget her own pet?
Or worse… why pretend she never had one?

A breeze stirred the trees nearby, rustling the branches like whispering voices just out of reach. I shivered.

Shaking the thought, I turned and walked to my own front door. The knob was cold in my hand. Inside, the house was dim and still. I dropped my keys onto the hallway table and leaned against the door for a moment.

It had been a strange day—long, unsettling day, full of rules I didn’t understand and people who seemed to be forgetting pieces of themselves.

And now I was part of it.

As I moved deeper into the house, the floorboards creaked beneath my steps, familiar yet faintly echoing—like the house, too, was trying to remember me.

My dad has COPD, he is on permanent oxygen, which, he doesn't always use as he should (he should have it at 5l/min when resting, up to 10l/min when doing anything physical.

My dad has always been messy really, you know the sort of thing, not washing up his dishes until the next day, finishing chocolate wrappers, bags of crisps etc, and just leaving them out. He eventually sorts things out, when things get really messy. But his house is such a mess, just full of clutter - he has no sense of pride. I am supposedly paid to clean his house, but it is not actually possible for me to actually clean it, because it is just so messy, and when I do clean it, he literally just messes it up the next day, and it actually affects my mental health, because it's just a futile task.

Dad also has carers that come in twice a week, and, they try their best I think, but, they came yesterday, and literally just made him a cup of coffee. Despite their clearly been dirty dishes. 

I just do not really know what to do about the matter. I pretty much feel utterly repulsed by my dad. He is a dirty, lazy pig, I know he has COPD, but, that's just the way it is, it doesn't negate him not carrying out everyday tasks.

1lrdbvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lrdbvx/the_alphas_mistake_by_anne_rice/,"The Alpha’s Mistake
By Anne Rice","Lexi’s arranged mating with Alpha Lorenzo Evans was meant to be a political alliance, but her mistake was falling in love with him despite his indifference. Over five years, she raised their son Finn and supported Lorenzo while he remained obsessed with Angelique, the woman who left him broken-hearted. When the contract binding them ends, Lexi decides to leave the pack for Europe to pursue her dream of becoming a storyteller, only to confront unresolved emotions and fractured bonds before her final departure.

# Chapter 1 - Bound and Broken: A Luna's Farewell

""Rose, I want to dissolve the mating bond with your son, the Alpha. You promised that if he didn’t fall in love with me within five years, the agreement would be null and void.""

I stood before Rose, the former Luna of the pack and mother of my mate, Lorenzo, Alpha of the Silver Crescent Pack. My heart didn’t ache—not anymore. At least, that’s what I told my wolf.

Five years as his mate. Five years as his Luna. None of it mattered compared to Angelique—his former chosen mate—returning.

""That’s what we agreed on,"" Rose said, her voice softening, ""but now you have Finn. You adore him so much. Can you really let someone else raise him?""

A pang of something cold flickered in my chest. Finn was my son—mine and Lorenzo’s. I had once loved him fiercely, as any mother wolf would her pup.

But that little pup, like his father, seemed to prefer Angelique over me.

""I can.""

The words left my lips without hesitation.

""My bond with Lorenzo was always just a political arrangement, and Finn… he was just part of that.""

""Besides,"" I added, my voice steady, ""now that Angelique’s back, neither Lorenzo nor Finn need me anymore.""

Over the past five years, I had developed real feelings for Alpha Lorenzo, my chosen mate. But all I received in return were constant disappointments.

Rose sighed, and I could almost hear the lament of her wolf, Selene, mourning her son’s foolishness.

""In seven days, the contract expires,"" she said, sliding a piece of paper toward me. ""Sign this, and after the week is up, the Silver Crescent Pack will no longer hold any claim over you.""

Without another word, I signed my name, my heart oddly light. Then, without looking back, I walked out of the Alpha’s mansion for the last time.

...

Once in the car, I received a photo from Finn’s preschool on my phone.

In the picture, Lorenzo was smiling broadly, leaning absentmindedly toward Angelique, while Finn clung tightly to her hand.

The three of them were wearing the matching outfits I had carefully chosen for Finn’s Thanksgiving celebration.

Not only did Angelique attend the event in my place, but she also wore the matching outfit meant for me.

...

Lorenzo and Angelique’s romance had once enchanted the entire pack.

He was the heir to the Silver Crescent Pack, one of the most powerful werewolf clans in the region; she was a rising star in the werewolf entertainment world, her beauty and talent unmatched.

No one expected that two seemingly mismatched individuals could fall so deeply in love.

As Angelique’s career soared, she decided to end things.

After that, Lorenzo fell apart. He drowned his sorrows in alcohol and, at one point, even contemplated ending his life.

The Alpha heir, besieged by heartbreak and desperate enough to consider ending it all, became an overnight sensation in the werewolf tabloids.

At that time, I was frantically trying to secure funds for my father’s surgery.

Rose, the former Luna, approached me with an offer: if I agreed to help, the Silver Crescent Pack would cover the surgery costs.

The condition was that I had to mate with Lorenzo to help him through his rough patch for five years.

After that day, Rose brought me to meet Lorenzo.

""Lorenzo, would you consider mating with Lexi?""

Both of us were extremely anxious; if Lorenzo refused, there would be no bond.

But eventually, he nodded, his expression indifferent, and said, ""Whatever. It could be her or anyone else.""

Our bond was nothing more than a political alliance, and my mistake was falling in love with him despite our arrangement.

As for Lorenzo, he never showed interest in me; we didn’t even bother to seal the mate bond officially.

Until one late night when he came home drunk, his dark eyes fixed on me.

""Let’s have a pup.""

That night, we found happiness together.

I thought it was a new beginning, but later realized that was the night Angelique announced her new relationship.

After Finn was born, Lorenzo’s attitude seemed to soften, and he no longer ignored my efforts.

Everything seemed peaceful until Angelique announced her breakup.

That night, Lorenzo and Angelique were photographed walking hand in hand by the river, with news headlines speculating a reunion.

After that, their interactions only increased, and Lorenzo even started bringing Angelique to our home.

Lorenzo, who never cared for photos, now not only bought the latest camera but also meticulously clipped newspaper articles about them.

He was always different with her.

I finally understood that no matter how hard I tried, Lorenzo’s heart was never with me.

Because he only ever loved Angelique.

But it’s okay; this was all just a transaction.

In seven days, I could leave this loveless pack, fly to Europe, and chase my dream of being a storyteller.

Thinking about this, I picked up my phone, contacted a publisher overseas, and booked a flight scheduled for a week later.

When I got home, I drove into the parking spot designated for the Luna.

The next moment, Angelique’s car swooped in, taking the space, and inside were my mate and my pup.

# Chapter 2 - Bound by Betrayal

The moment Angelique Torres stepped out of her sleek sedan, that irritating smirk already plastered across her face, I knew this day was about to get worse. She strutted toward me like she owned the place, her heels clicking against the pavement.

“Oops, did I snag your parking spot? Hope that’s not a problem, \*Lexi\*,” she said, her voice dripping with faux sweetness.

Before I could bite back, Lorenzo Evans’ voice cut through the air, firm and unyielding. “The spot’s public. Park wherever you want.” His gaze met mine, a silent warning flickering in his eyes.

Finn, my own son, chimed in next, his tone laced with that bratty edge he’d perfected lately. “Don’t mind Mom, Aunt Angelique. She’s always driving that old van. I’m embarrassed to even be seen with it.”

His words hit like a punch to the gut. I’d raised him for four years, and this was how he treated me now? My wolf, Luna, stirred in the back of my mind, but I pushed her down, refusing to let her take over.

Lorenzo, oblivious—or maybe just indifferent—to the sting of Finn’s words, took Angelique’s arm with a gentleness he never showed me. “Come on, let me show you the room I set up for you. It’s right next to mine,” he said, his voice softening in a way that made my chest tighten.

Finn bounced on his toes, his excitement practically radiating. “Yes! Finally, someone fun is here. Aunt Angelique knows how to have a good time!” He shot me a sideways glance and added, “Unlike Mom. She’s so boring.”

Lorenzo glanced at me, as if suddenly remembering I was still there, and added casually, “Oh, by the way, Angelique’s lease ended. She’ll be staying with us for a while.”

I kept my face neutral, my voice icy. “I see.” Lorenzo’s eyes flickered with surprise, as if he hadn’t expected such calm from me.

Angelique, ever the performer, feigned concern. “Maybe I should just stay at a hotel. After all, Lexi is your mate and Luna, and I’m just a guest.”

Finn was quick to jump in, his voice tinged with annoyance. “Aunt Angelique, you and Dad go way back. If anyone’s the outsider here, it’s Mom.”

Lorenzo nodded, his smile returning. “Exactly. This house was always meant for you, Angelique. You’re not an outsider.” He turned to her, his tone light but commanding. “Grab the keys and open the trunk. Help me with the bags.”

I couldn’t help but mutter under my breath, “Can’t she manage it herself?”

Lorenzo’s head snapped toward me, his expression one of shock, as if I’d just committed some unforgivable offense. “If you don’t want to help, never mind. I’ll ask the Omega.”

“No need,” I said flatly, taking the keys from him. My face remained a mask, all emotions carefully tucked away.

When I returned with the suitcases, Finn was eagerly showing Angelique a gift he’d prepared for her—four small bars of Swiss chocolate, each one painstakingly saved over the years.

Angelique’s eyes widened in feigned surprise, while my stomach churned. The Evans family was wealthy beyond measure, yet those chocolates were something I’d carefully hoarded for Finn. Every year on his birthday, I gave him one, a symbol of my love and blessings.

And now, he’d handed them to Angelique without a second thought.

Lorenzo frowned, his voice sharp. “Finn, those are your mother’s birthday gifts to you. How could you just give them away?”

Finn shrugged, his tone careless. “Aunt Angelique isn’t just anyone. I like her. Besides, they’re just chocolates. The Evans family doesn’t run short on that stuff!”

Lorenzo opened his mouth to argue, but I cut him off, my voice cold and detached. “Finn’s right. The chocolates aren’t important. If he wants to give them away, it’s fine.”

Ignoring their stunned expressions, I retreated to my room alone. Leaning against the door, I closed my eyes, the weight of the day pressing down on me.

Just seven more days—seven days until I could leave this place for good. My wolf, Luna, stirred again, her voice a quiet whisper in my mind.

\*You’re stronger than this. You’ll find your freedom soon.\*

I took a deep breath, letting her words steady me. Freedom was so close I could almost taste it.

# Chapter 3 - Breaking the Bond: A Countdown to Freedom

The morning light crept through the curtains, pulling me from a restless sleep. Lorenzo and I had never shared a bedroom—our bond was more of a formality than a union. His Alpha instincts demanded solitude, and I’d long since accepted that his space was his sanctuary, even if it left me feeling more like an outsider than ever.

After dressing quickly, I headed to Estella Walker’s law firm. She was a trusted figure in the werewolf community, and her wolf, Sage, lent her an air of quiet strength. I laid out my situation, my voice steady despite the storm brewing inside me.

“Are you doing this because of the contract?” Estella asked, her tone cautious but probing.

I nodded. “It’s not just the contract. It’s about reclaiming my life.”

Her shoulders relaxed slightly, and she leaned back in her chair. “I’ve been worried about you, Lexi. The tension in the pack has been palpable. Knowing it’s about the contract… it’s a relief, in a way.”

Then she leaned forward, her voice dropping to a near whisper. “So, what’s the plan? Are you planning to sever the mate bond?”

I let out a bitter laugh. “We never truly sealed it. I need a contract to relinquish my rights to Finn.”

Estella’s eyes widened. “Lexi, everyone knows how much you care for Finn. Giving up your rights as his mother—that’s a monumental decision.”

I stared at my hands, my voice barely audible. “Just draft it.”

She hesitated but didn’t press further. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, and within minutes, the contract was in my hands. The weight of the paper felt like a stone in my chest as I walked out of her office.

“Lexi,” Estella called after me, her voice tinged with sadness. “It’s been five years, and you’ve never truly reached him. Take care of yourself from now on.”

I paused, forced a smile, and nodded. “I will.”

\---

When I returned to the Silver Crescent Pack’s mansion, the house was eerily quiet. The breakfast I’d made earlier sat untouched on the table, now cold. I reheated it mechanically and headed upstairs to call Lorenzo and Finn.

Lorenzo’s room was strictly off-limits unless you knocked—a rule he enforced with his Alpha tone if necessary. I barely tapped on the door when it swung open. Angelique stood there, her golden hair tousled and a smirk plastered across her face.

“I was just borrowing the bathroom. My back’s been acting up,” she said, her tone dripping with mock innocence.

Before she could continue, Lorenzo appeared behind her, his dark hair disheveled and his pajamas wrinkled. “Angelique, who’s at the door? Is it Finn?” he asked, his voice still heavy with sleep.

My eyes flicked to the faint red marks on his neck. I almost laughed. Five years of being his mate, and we’d barely touched. I’d always thought he wasn’t interested in intimacy; now, I realized he just wasn’t interested in me.

When he saw me, Lorenzo’s face flushed, and he quickly adjusted his collar. “Angelique was just here to borrow a charger. Don’t get the wrong idea.”

I gave a dry chuckle. He couldn’t even come up with a convincing lie. I let it go, simply mentioning that breakfast was ready before heading downstairs. This mate bond was nothing more than a contract to me, and I didn’t care who Lorenzo was involved with. I was counting down the days—seven more, and I’d be free.

A few minutes later, the three of them finally came downstairs. Finn glanced at the coffee and wrinkled his nose. “This isn’t fresh, Mom. I want your freshly baked muffins!”

Lorenzo tried to coax him, his Alpha tone softening into something almost paternal. “We can have your mom make them tomorrow. Just eat these for now, okay?”

“No, I want them now!” Finn insisted, his voice carrying a stubborn edge.

Lorenzo was about to stand firm when Angelique chimed in, her voice sugary sweet. “Lexi, I’ve heard your muffins are legendary. I’d love to try them.”

Immediately, Lorenzo’s tone shifted, his Alpha authority cutting through the room. “Since everyone wants them, why don’t you make some?”

Without looking up, I continued eating my pancakes. “If you want muffins, make them yourself. I made these pancakes from scratch this morning. If you don’t want them, throw them away.”

The room fell silent, my words hanging in the air like a challenge. Angelique’s smirk faltered, and Finn stared at me, his young face a mix of confusion and frustration. But I didn’t care. Seven more days, and this would all be over.

# Chapter 4 - Shadows of the Alpha's Choice

Lorenzo Evans was visibly stunned. The Lexi Ellis he knew had rarely, if ever, turned him down. No matter what he asked of her—no matter how unreasonable—she’d always gone out of her way to make it happen. The word “no” had been almost nonexistent in their relationship. Until now.

Angelique Torres let out a soft chuckle, her eyes glinting with a hint of self-mockery. “I’ve probably overstayed my welcome, haven’t I? I didn’t mean to be a burden. Still, I couldn’t help but hope for one of Luna Lexi’s famous dinners.”

With that, Angelique turned to leave.

Finn, who had been watching the exchange, suddenly burst into tears, his small voice trembling. “You’re being mean, Mom! Don’t be mean to Aunt Angelique!”

Lorenzo, my mate and the Alpha of the Silver Crescent Pack, quickly reached out to stop Angelique, his grip firm on her arm. He turned to me, frustration etched across his face. “Are you still upset about this morning? I already told you, Angelique just stopped by to borrow a charger. Why are you making such a big deal out of it?”

My voice was icy, devoid of emotion. “I’m exhausted. I can’t cook right now.”

Finn froze, his eyes widening with concern. “Mom, are you sick?”

Then, as if struck by a sudden thought, he wrinkled his nose and covered his mouth dramatically. “Ew, Mom, why didn’t you say something? What if Aunt Angelique catches whatever you have?”

He tugged at Lorenzo’s sleeve, his voice pleading. “Alpha, we should take Aunt Angelique to see the healer, just to be safe.”

Angelique smiled softly, shaking her head. “Really, Finn, I’m fine. There’s no need.”

But Lorenzo’s eyes softened as he looked at her. “Let’s just do what Finn wants. You know how long it takes for you to recover when you’re not feeling well. Better to be cautious.”

With that, the three of them walked out together, hand in hand, leaving me alone at the table with the now cold dinner rolls.

After years of living together, my own mate and son had not only dismissed me but were now overly concerned about Angelique, who was clearly perfectly healthy.

I tossed the leftover rolls into the trash and sat in silence for a moment, my mind racing.

My phone buzzed with a message from Lorenzo.

\[We’re heading to the grocery store. Come pick us up.\]

When I arrived at the store, only Angelique and Finn were there.

“Aunt Angelique, can I have ice cream?” Finn begged, tugging at her sleeve.

Angelique grinned, pinching his cheek affectionately. “Of course, sweetheart. If that’s what you want, Aunt Angelique will get it for you.”

I stepped forward immediately, my voice firm. “Finn, you know what the healer said. Your stomach can’t handle ice cream.”

Finn’s face fell, his disappointment evident.

“Luna Lexi,” Angelique said with a light laugh, “it’s just ice cream. Let the kid have a little fun. No need to be so strict.”

My expression darkened. “This is a family matter, Miss Torres. It’s not your place to interfere.”

Just then, Lorenzo returned.

Angelique looked at him, her lips curving into a pout. “Alpha, I wanted to get Finn some ice cream, but Luna Lexi wouldn’t allow it.”

I kept my voice steady, though my patience was wearing thin. “The healer recommended other snacks. Ice cream can wait.”

Lorenzo’s face hardened, his Alpha tone sharp and commanding. “You’re being too controlling. It’s just ice cream. Couldn’t Angelique get it for him? She’s only trying to help. Why are you making this into a scene?”

My heart sank. The way Lorenzo defended Angelique, even at the expense of our son’s health, left me speechless.

I let out a bitter laugh, deciding it wasn’t worth arguing.

Suddenly, it was clear: with Angelique’s return, I had become an outsider in my own pack. No matter what I did, I could never compete with the Angelique they adored.

# Chapter 5 - Shadows of the Alpha's Heart

Angelique Torres smirked as Finn’s voice cut through the air, sharp and unrelenting.

""Alpha Lorenzo and Aunt Angelique are the best! Not like mom, who won’t even get me a milkshake!""

His words drew the attention of nearby pack members, their whispers and pointed glances making my chest tighten. This was the boy I’d raised for four years, the future of the Silver Crescent Pack. My heart ached.

Lorenzo Evans, my mate and the Alpha, stood silently, letting Finn’s words hang in the air unchallenged. It wasn’t until Angelique stepped in with a dramatic display of intervention that the scene finally ended.

As we left the grocery store, they suggested heading to a nearby Italian restaurant. Though framed as an invitation, it was clear I had no choice but to comply. Lorenzo’s tone, casual yet firm, left no room for refusal.

He ordered an extravagant spread of rich, flavorful dishes—except for a plain plate of buttered noodles for Finn. No one bothered to ask for my input before handing the menu to the waiter. As Luna, I should’ve been consulted, but it seemed my role had been reduced to a mere formality.

""Alpha Lorenzo, it’s been so long, but you still remember my favorite dishes. How thoughtful of you,"" Angelique said, her voice dripping with sweetness as she lightly brushed her hand against his, causing him to flush. Her scent—vanilla with a sharp edge—filled the air, making my stomach twist.

As the food arrived, Lorenzo was too busy serving Angelique to notice me. I kept my head down, picking at a plain dinner roll without touching anything else. The aroma of the dishes was overwhelming, but I had no appetite.

""Why aren’t you eating?"" Lorenzo asked, his Alpha tone softening just slightly.

I replied quietly, ""Rich foods don’t agree with me.""

He looked surprised, as if he’d just realized I might have preferences different from his assumptions. ""Let me order something lighter for you,"" he said, picking up the menu again. ""What would you like?""

""No need,"" I said. ""You all enjoy.""

Before he could press further, a passerby pointed at Angelique, exclaiming, ""Aren’t you Angelique Torres? The star from \*Moonlit Howl\*?""

""And you’re Alpha Lorenzo Evans, of the Silver Crescent Pack?!""

Angelique nodded with a gracious smile, and the fan’s excitement bubbled over. ""I’m such a fan of you two together! I heard online you’ve reconciled—it’s like a real-life romance drama!""

""Are you really back together?"" the fan asked eagerly.

Lorenzo glanced at me before nodding slightly, offering a soft ""Mm-hmm.""

The fan practically squealed. ""After five years apart and finding each other again, if this isn’t true love, I don’t know what is!""

Angelique smiled warmly. ""It was my mistake before, not appreciating what we had. I promise to cherish Alpha Lorenzo from now on.""

Lorenzo’s face lit up as he looked at her. After the fan left, Finn grinned.

""Alpha, since you’re with Aunt Angelique, can I have a new mom?""

Lorenzo quickly covered Finn’s mouth, his voice tinged with apology as he turned to me. ""He doesn’t understand. Don’t take it to heart.""

I didn’t respond, prompting him to add, ""I only said that earlier for Angelique’s public image.""

I nodded. ""I understand. You don’t need to explain.""

My calmness seemed to unsettle him. Angelique, sensing the tension, gently took his hand. ""Alpha Lorenzo, eat up before it gets cold.""

A soft smile spread across his face, and soon he was fully absorbed in her presence, forgetting I was even there.

After dinner, we crossed the street to the parking lot. Suddenly, a car sped out of a side road. Instinctively, Lorenzo pulled Angelique and Finn to the sidewalk, leaving me standing in the street.

The screech of brakes filled the air as I fell to the ground.

Panic flashed in Lorenzo’s eyes as he rushed to my side, his voice trembling. ""Lexi! Are you okay? I’ll get you to the hospital right now!""

I wanted to reassure him, to tell him not to worry, but the pain was too much to speak.

As I reached out to comfort him, Finn shouted again.

""Alpha, Aunt Angelique’s about to faint! You need to go to her now!""

# Chapter 6 - Fractured Loyalties

The instant Lorenzo’s head whipped around at Finn’s shout, I could feel his Alpha energy surge, thick with panic. Angelique managed a shaky smile, her voice barely steady as she spoke. “Alpha Lorenzo, I’m okay. It’s just…

# Chapter 1 - My Life For Yours

I’m going to die.

And nobody gives a damn.

So, I wish myself a life devoid of rebirth after death.

May our paths never cross again.

Caspian materialized, suitcase in tow.

I was a fragile, silent thing, huddled in an oversized coat on the couch.

He shifted slightly, his form a cold, detached outline in the dim light.

Not a single word escaped his lips.

And then he was gone.

I, for my part, didn’t even bother to look up.

The door clicked shut.

My head remained bowed for what felt like forever before I finally raised it.

Staring blankly at the daylight filtering through the window.

It felt like the entire world had given up on me.

Even my husband doesn’t want me around.

He probably thinks I’m beyond saving.

And maybe he’s right.

My trembling hand instinctively went to my stomach.

Just a week ago, there had been a four-month-old baby nestled inside me.

But it quietly slipped away.

I felt utterly and completely alone.

I desperately wanted a child of my own. I’d teach them to read, to sing silly songs.

Teach them to call me Mom.

But that’s never going to happen, is it?

The title of Mrs. Franklin was never truly mine to claim.

This is my punishment for daring to reach for something that was never meant for me.

I slumped back against the couch, feeling utterly defeated.

A weak, humorless laugh escaped my lips.

""I guess I really have nothing left in me.""

I have no idea how long I just sat there, lost in my thoughts.

Eventually, I got up and went to the table, placing the picture frame down with a soft thud.

Someone once said that love is a lifelong journey.

But the truth is, I don’t think I’m capable of love anymore.

I was just about to set the curtains ablaze with the lighter, ready to watch it all burn.

Then the phone started ringing.

I snapped my head towards it.

Hesitated.

But didn’t answer.

It just kept ringing, insistent and demanding.

Finally, I gave in and picked it up.

""Hello?""

""Why did it take you so long to answer?"" It was Annabelle Marshall.

I watched the flickering flame of the lighter dance in front of my eyes.

""Is it urgent?""

""Jolene’s liver is acting up. You need to get to the hospital for a compatibility test.""

I paused, the lighter still in my hand. ""...cough.""

""Are you even listening to me?""

I nodded slowly.

The smoke was getting thicker, stinging my eyes and making me cough uncontrollably.

""I understand.""

""Why are you coughing so much?"" Annabelle asked, her voice laced with suspicion.

""The smoke is too thick; it’s choking me.""

I didn’t say anything else, just tossed the phone aside, grabbed the fire extinguisher, and put out the flames.

Once the fire was completely extinguished.

I tossed the extinguisher aside and collapsed back onto the scorched corner of the sofa.

Gasping for air.

Finally, my hand moved to the area where my liver should be.

The liver?

Alright then.

If I can still help Jolene.

That would be some kind of redemption for me, wouldn’t it?

When I finally arrived at the hospital.

Alfred and Annabelle were already waiting impatiently outside the ward.

Annabelle tapped her foot, her expression tight with disapproval. “What took you so long?”

My gaze was distant and unfocused.

I merely glanced at my parents.

Alfred, ever the peacemaker, gently pulled Annabelle aside.

“Don’t say anything more.”

They reluctantly followed me into the ward.

My eyes scanned the room, landing on the bed.

But the first person I actually \*saw\* was Caspian.

I immediately lowered my gaze.

Ignoring the surprised look on his face.

“I’m heading back to the office,” he announced, standing up abruptly.

He gave a curt nod to my parents.

Even the most composed person can be a little thrown off balance when they see me.

I raised my head slightly, staring out the window.

Of course.

He hadn’t stayed at the hospital when I lost the babies, not once.

I had already told myself I wouldn’t get upset.

But at this moment, my eyes still stung with unshed tears.

But it was fleeting.

The dryness returned quickly.

The figure on the bed lay motionless, pale and seemingly lifeless.

I reached out my hand almost involuntarily.

“What do you think you’re doing?” Annabelle snapped, her voice sharp and accusing.

My hand simply brushed against Jolene’s head, gently smoothing her tangled hair.

After that small gesture, I finally looked at my parents.

“When will the matching process begin?”

Alfred seemed momentarily taken aback by the coldness emanating from me.

At that moment, Derek Morgan, the attending physician, walked into the room.

“Has the candidate arrived?”

But upon seeing me clearly, a flicker of surprise crossed his face.

“You’re not a suitable match.”

I didn’t say a word, just stared straight ahead.

“Lara, are you deaf? Go home.” Annabelle said.

“I can do this, please.”

It was the only plea I could manage.

Then, I turned to leave.

“You?” Derek Morgan scoffed.

“You just miscarried a few days ago, are you trying to kill yourself?”

I paused for a moment at the doorway, my hand on the handle.

“It’s just a test. It won’t kill me.”

Behind me, I heard a long, weary sigh.

The tests were endless.

I ended up staying at the hospital for three days, going through one procedure after another.

In a way, it gave me a chance to physically recover.

After three days.

The tests were finally complete.

I made my way to the fifth floor, where Jolene was staying.

A family of three stood huddled together, blocking my path.

It was Alfred who saw me first.

He waved me over with a hesitant smile.

I nodded and walked into the room.

“Dad, Mom, Jolene.”

“How did it go, have the results come back yet?” Alfred asked.

“Not yet.”

“I’ll head back now.”

My eyes met Jolene's briefly.

As soon as our eyes met, she looked away, avoiding my gaze.

Annabelle glanced at me, her expression unreadable. “Alright, you can go now.”

I nodded and turned to leave.

But just as I reached the doorway.

Alfred called out to me.

“Lara, this pendant looks like something Caspian dropped, could you return it to him?”

I turned my head slowly.

My eyes fixed on the silver locket Alfred was holding out, and I felt a jolt of surprise.

“I found it the day Caspian came to visit.”

Instinctively, my gaze flickered towards the bed, taking in the sight of my sister and mother.

Still, I reached out and took the locket from Alfred's hand.

“Alright.”

As I stepped out into the hallway.

I couldn't help but overhear Annabelle's sharp whisper. “What are you doing? Are you afraid she won’t get to see Caspian?”

Alfred sighed, his voice low. “Their situation doesn’t look good. I fear the two of them might not be able to hold on.”

In the silent hallway, the words hung in the air.

I turned and walked away.

# Chapter 2 - The Liver You Borrowed

Franklin Corporation

I'd already clocked thirty minutes in this sterile waiting room.

Caspian finally wrapped up whatever power meeting he was in and emerged.

He strode into the office, and the moment his eyes landed on me, his brow crinkled in that familiar way.

I finished off the lukewarm coffee and pushed myself to my feet.

Unclasping the pendant from my neck, I held it out to him.

""Here to give this back.""

He flicked a glance at the offered jewelry.

The frown deepened, a hint of annoyance flashing in his eyes as he refused to take it.

Did he think my touch had somehow contaminated it?

I pivoted and placed the pendant on the vast expanse of his desk, offering a curt nod.

Time to leave.

""Wait.""

He made a beeline for his desk.

I aimed for the door.

I hesitated.

""Something else?""

He inclined his head towards the plush sofa. ""Sit down for a minute.""

I stood there, momentarily thrown.

He shrugged off his coat but remained tight-lipped, his hand forming a tight fist.

I broke the silence. ""Going to ask if the transplant compatibility test was a match?""

I was about to tell him the results weren't in yet.

Then my phone buzzed in my pocket.

I pulled it out to check.

Simultaneously, his phone vibrated as well.

It hit me then – he'd been keeping tabs on the hospital's updates.

A dry chuckle escaped my lips.

""If that’s all, I'll head home and try to get myself in top shape for tomorrow’s surgery.""

I reached for the door handle.

""Lara, after the transplant… let's try to make things work, okay?""

My hand froze on the cold metal.

Did he just… what?

Was he actually willing to accept me?

Accept me, the woman he's always referred to as his biggest mistake?

But the truth is, I have no desire to 'make things work' with you.

Caspian, I'm beyond tired.

Completely drained.

I have nothing left to offer.

I didn't dignify his statement with a response.

Instead, I opened the door and walked out.

\---

Back at the condo.

I let the pulled pork simmer on the stove, then aimlessly wandered away from the kitchen.

Bored and restless.

I switched on the TV.

Eventually, I drifted off.

I woke the next morning.

Still sprawled awkwardly on the couch.

The room was bathed in silence.

Only soft sunlight filtered through the gap in the curtains.

This place is far too big.

I should get a cat.

The thought flitted through my mind as I reached for my phone, browsing adoption options online.

But when it came down to choosing one, I hesitated.

A cat?

No, I don't need that.

Owning a pet is a serious commitment, not something to be taken lightly.

\---

One week until the surgery.

I checked into the hospital.

My mom, Annabelle Marshall, actually showed up to see me.

We sat in strained silence for what felt like an eternity, neither of us willing to initiate a conversation.

She wasn’t going to, and frankly, I didn't feel like it either.

""Sorry, but the nicer rooms on the fifth floor were all booked, otherwise your father and I would have gotten you one.""

I simply nodded once.

I turned my gaze towards the window.

""You used to be such a chatterbox when you were little. What happened?""

She sighed heavily and stood up.

""Well, I'll head up to see Jolene first, then I’ll come back to check on you later.""

""Okay.""

She shuffled towards the door.

I stared at the spot where she'd been sitting and the basket of bread rolls she'd awkwardly left behind.

A short laugh escaped me.

The way she nervously stood up, clutched the bread rolls, and then scurried away was almost comical.

Was she embarrassed?

I still can't figure her out.

She could have just gone upstairs, dropped off the bread rolls, and then doubled back.

But she openly dislikes me.

Why would she make a special trip just for me?

\---

Today, I finished the last of my pre-op tests.

Tomorrow is the day.

Clutching the stack of medical reports, I returned to my dreary room.

It was, as always, utterly empty.

I sank onto the edge of the bed, feeling numb.

How could it feel so hollow?

Oh, right.

Caspian did say we should try to make a life together, didn't he?

During my recovery time at home, he never came back.

The week I've been stuck in this hospital, he hasn't bothered to visit once.

Is this his idea of making things work?

Oh.

He specified after the surgery, that’s when we’d start our new life together.

I get it.

He doesn't truly want me.

He just feels obligated and plans to repay that debt with a lifetime of forced companionship.

As long as Jolene is healthy and happy.

He wants nothing else.

\---

Surgery day.

As Jolene and I were about to be wheeled into the operating room, Caspian finally made an appearance.

“Mom, Dad, I’m so scared.”

“It’s okay, sweetie, just think of it as a long nap. The doctor said once it's done, you’ll be as good as new.”

My mom gently tucked a stray strand of hair under Jolene's surgical cap.

Caspian hurried over. ""Is it time?""

""Yes.""

Jolene pulled away from Mom, reaching out towards Caspian.

He instinctively reached out in response.

But Jolene retracted her hand, offering a faint smile.

""Caspian, you're here.""

His hand froze in mid-air.

He stole a fleeting glance in my direction.

Then quickly dropped his hand.

""Yes, it's a very advanced procedure these days, nothing to worry about.""

""Okay.""

Then she flashed another smile. ""You should go say something to Lara. She's been waiting for you.""

Caspian gave a short nod.

He turned to face me.

But his lips seemed sealed shut, and he couldn’t force out a single word.

The surgical team, now fully scrubbed in and gowned, announced, ""Alright, time to head into the OR, family please step back.""

The gurney started rolling.

At that moment, my sister’s fear washed over her again.

She reached out blindly.

Calling out the name closest to her heart.

""Caspian.""

“Don’t be scared.”

There was no time for hand-holding; Caspian simply steadied the bed rail.

My bed rolled forward.

I observed the entire scene play out.

Calmly.

Quietly.

Until the operating room doors slowly swung shut.

Caspian’s motionless figure gradually being blocked from view.

I closed my eyes.

As the surgery was about to commence.

I heard a whispered word of gratitude.

""Thank you, Lara, for agreeing to donate your liver.""

The anesthesia flooded my system.

As I started to lose consciousness.

I barely managed to whisper.

""You're welcome.""

# Chapter 3 - Stolen: My Sister's Keeper

It was like being trapped in a long, disorienting dream.

Nothing felt real, as if a thick curtain blurred my vision.

In the sterile silence of the corridor, I thought I caught a whisper.

""Knowing how your life unfolds, would you still choose this path?""

I strained my neck, trying to locate the speaker.

But the corridor remained empty.

Through the haze, I glimpsed an operating theater.

The surgeons inside were deep in hushed debate.

""Why such an extensive extraction?""

""Wasn't the agreed amount seventy percent?""

""This is excessive. Can the donor even recover from this?""

...

Am I even alive?

Why does my body feel so impossibly light?

I felt myself drifting, untethered.

So much blood on the table, an appalling amount.

And still, I drifted further.

""Sisters, and yet the mother so clearly favors the older one? To allow such a drastic procedure, all to save her.""

""The younger one didn’t object?""

""She simply stared blankly at the documents, then out the window, completely silent.""

""I wanted to offer her some comfort, right then and there.""

I was lost, with no sense of where I was headed.

Four days crawled by.

My eyes fluttered open, slow and heavy.

My body felt pinned, heavy and numb, trapped beneath an invisible weight.

Only my eyes possessed the slightest mobility.

Everything was bathed in white.

""You're awake.""

Ellis Lane, the nurse, was suddenly there.

Her smile was gentle and reassuring.

I managed a slight nod.

""Would you like some water? Let me help you.""

""Thank you..."" My voice was a dry rasp.

She turned, filled a glass, inserted a straw, and brought it to my lips.

The moment I attempted to swallow, a searing pain ripped through my body.

""Easy now, just small sips.""

I managed to take a few.

The nurse took a step back.

""My sister... is she...""

""You mean Jolene, yes? She woke up yesterday and has already been moved out of the ICU.""

That was a small piece of good news.

I gave another small nod.

""Um...""

The nurse hesitated, and I slowly turned my gaze toward her.

She drew a deep breath before continuing.

""Are you... really sisters?""

My eyes flickered downward.

""And that handsome man, is he your husband?... Or your sister’s?""

Her curiosity was palpable, laced with a hint of pity.

I could only imagine what she must have overheard.

With both Jolene and I here these past few days, things must have been said.

I offered no reply.

Closing my eyes, I succumbed to the crushing weight of everything.

Once her loving uncle, Khari now stands as an impenetrable wall, engaged to Ila's childhood bully. Ila's return is further complicated by her own impending marking ceremony with Messiah, her fiancé and Beta of the Crimson Fang Pack.

# Chapter 1 - The Exile's Return

My breath hitched in my throat, each syllable a shard of ice: “Naomi Fox, I don't want to see you anywhere near here again unless I specifically invite you.”

Tears stung my eyes, barely kept at bay, as I focused on him, Walter Gonzalez, Alpha of the Silver Moon Pack—that face I had worshiped since childhood. A face that once radiated joy in my presence, now hardened into granite.

“Uncle Walter,” I whispered, taking a hesitant step closer, drawn by an undeniable pull.

“Stay back,” he snapped, recoiling as if burned, his wolf's snarl a guttural rejection. My heart plummeted into a void.

Alpha Walter was my guardian—the uncle I had chosen. He had been my father’s most trusted confidant before becoming my protector. I remember when he was my everything, and he cherished me like his own. But time, as it often does, warped everything. A forbidden desire surfaced the moment I understood what longing meant—a spark I pursued, a flame he extinguished, fearing its potential devastation.

“If you possess even a shred of self-awareness,” he said, his alpha tone piercing the air like frost, “sort yourself out, Naomi.”

Then he banished me—four years of exile...

Four years.

Standing at the threshold of the Silver Moon Packhouse, the weight of the intervening years crashed over me like a rogue wave. The air was thick with the familiar scent of pine and raw power—his scent—unaltered by time. My fingers traced the weathered runes etched into the doorframe, their sharp edges a stark reminder of a life I once believed would be mine forever.

Four years had elapsed since I was cast out, like a pariah, banished across the ocean to a place where my name held no significance, my sorrow even less.

....

When I was eight, after my parents perished in a devastating car crash, Walter Gonzalez, my father's closest friend, adopted me and raised me within the pack. He embodied everything an Alpha should be—powerful, commanding, and larger than life. To the rest of the pack, he was untouchable, revered. To me, he was both savior and guardian.

He raised me as if I were his daughter, yet I was always acutely aware of the chasm that separated us. He was Alpha, and I was merely a Beta, a late bloomer who didn't even undergo her first shift until well into adulthood. Still, despite our differences, he treated me with exceptional kindness and care, shielding me from the pack's inherent cruelty and its relentless expectations. And I cherished those moments, even as I felt the stirrings of a forbidden desire deep within my soul.

By the time I turned sixteen, that desire had morphed into something I could no longer suppress. I found myself seeking his company, yearning for his attention, his approval. I memorized the way his jaw tightened when he was displeased, the way his scent—a blend of pine, cedar, and a dark, almost dangerous note—permeated every room he occupied. I knew it was wrong, yet I couldn't restrain myself. He wasn't a blood relative; he wasn't even truly my uncle. So, why did it feel so forbidden?

When I turned eighteen, my entire world crumbled. A diary. A confession. One unforgivable mistake.

He found it hidden beneath my pillow. His gaze scanned the pages, my most intimate thoughts exposed before him. I reached out, desperate to explain, but then he met my eyes.

And in that instant, I realized—I had irrevocably lost him.

He made his decision swiftly: I had to leave. Within twenty-four hours, I was packed and on a plane to Europe, far removed from the Silver Moon Pack and the man who had once been the center of my universe.

Just as I was about to push open the heavy oak door of the packhouse, my phone vibrated in my pocket. Seeing ""Hubby"" displayed on the screen triggered an involuntary smile, and I answered the call.

""Naomi, we finalized the date for our marking ceremony. It's exactly one month from today. Have you decided whether you prefer it in New York or elsewhere in the States?""

The reassuring voice of Theodore Simmons, my fiancé and Beta of the Crimson Fang Pack, calmed my nerves. After a brief pause, I responded, ""In the States.""

""Understood, I'll start making the arrangements immediately."" His tone remained gentle, and after a beat, he added, ""Make sure you extend the invitation to Alpha Walter when you see him.""

""Of course,"" I replied sweetly, and after a few more exchanges, we reluctantly ended the call.

Initially, Europe presented a considerable challenge. The language barrier, the cultural differences. Life was difficult, and on several occasions, I found myself in perilous situations, narrowly escaping death during encounters with rogue wolves. In a moment of sheer desperation, I called Alpha Walter, hoping he would bring me home.

However, my calls went unanswered, and my messages vanished into the ether. If Theodore hadn't intervened to save me, I might have succumbed to one of those terrifying events.

As we got to know each other better, we discovered that we both came from influential packs, and our connection deepened from there. Over the next two years, Theodore's unwavering dedication won me over, and I accepted his proposal. Soon after graduation, he proposed, and I accepted without hesitation. It was around that time that Alpha Walter finally contacted me, permitting me to return to pay my respects to my parents.

I also returned to present him with an invitation and inform him that I was getting married.

Just as I was about to enter the packhouse, the door swung open from the inside.

""Well, well... look who decided to grace us with her presence."" It was Margo Weaver, my tormentor, my college nightmare.

""Delta Margo,"" I breathed, a knot tightening in my throat. How is she here? The thought echoed in my mind.

I blinked, and in a moment, a sense of recognition dawned on me as I recalled the familiarity concealed beneath her once-unfamiliar facade. A nightmare resurfaced, and old fears flooded over me, leaving my limbs stiff and my back clammy with dread. ""What are you doing here?""

Before I could process the situation further, Alpha Walter emerged from the doorway. Tall and imposing, he still projected the same commanding aura, his dominance as palpable as ever. Noticing my reaction, he frowned in disapproval. ""You should show more respect to Margo, my future Luna.""

Margo?!

""Why her? She once...""

The words about her bullying me hadn't even left my lips when Alpha Walter interrupted me. ""Once what?""

I remembered the past.

Life in Europe had been isolating at first. Desperately seeking solace, I looked for news of him, only to discover that he had found his mate, one he showered with the same affection he had once reserved for me. Fireworks illuminating the night sky on her birthday, 9,999 roses flown in for her, extravagant gestures at auctions—all the tenderness he had once directed towards me, now lavished on her.

I cried in solitude, enduring the searing pain, surviving each agonizing night, until I finally accepted that he loved another.

But what I never anticipated was that the person who had replaced me would be Margo, the very person who had bullied me relentlessly in school!

Seeing him stand by her side, defending her, I opened my mouth to speak, but ultimately shook my head, my voice barely audible. ""Nothing.""

""If there's nothing, come in. Appreciate this rare opportunity to return. Let go of past resentments. Your parents' anniversary is approaching; I will accompany you to pay our respects.""

""Margo is also moving in today. Settle in, and make an effort to get along with her.""

With that, he departed the packhouse with Margo in tow.

Watching them walk away, I could only manage a bitter smile.

After a long pause, I murmured softly to myself, ""There's no future for me here, Alpha Walter. Once I have paid my respects to my parents, I will leave for good.""

They returned in the evening, and it took until the dead of night to finish unloading their belongings. Clutching my wedding invitation, I stood outside Alpha Walter's room, mentally preparing myself before softly knocking on the door.

The door opened, not revealing Alpha Walter, but Margo.

Her smile dripped with malice. ""What's this? After all these years, have you come to reminisce?""

I froze as a flood of nightmarish memories resurfaced. Instinctively, I tried to retreat, but she seized my arm.

""I'm warning you, keep your mouth shut. Don't even think about revealing our past to Alpha Walter.""

Hearing her menacing tone, I suppressed my fear and retorted, ""Do you truly believe that your lies will remain hidden forever? Sooner or later, he will see your true colors.""

But Margo appeared unfazed. Instead, she grew even more smug. ""I could crush you then, and I can still crush you now.""

Before I could react, she grabbed a nearby cup of coffee and splashed it all over herself.

""Ah!""

As her shriek echoed through the air, Alpha Walter rushed out of his study, his face etched with panic. He cradled Margo in his arms as she feigned distress, tears streaming down her face. ""Alpha Walter, don't blame Naomi...""

""Naomi, I allowed you to return, believing you had moved on. I never imagined you would remain so stubborn. Let me remind you one last time; some things are impossible. No matter what schemes you concoct, you will never get what you desire!""

His harsh words clarified everything. He believed I had thrown the coffee at Margo out of jealousy?

I hastily began to explain, ""No, you misunderstand. I came to give you a wedding inv...""

But before I could finish, Alpha Walter carried Margo away.

Watching him leave, an overwhelming sadness washed over me. I let out a self-deprecating laugh, completing my sentence.

""I came to give you a wedding invitation. I've found someone who truly loves me. I'm getting married... and it's not to you.""

# Chapter 2 - Hospital Visit

The following morning, Walter Gonzalez, Alpha of the local pack, filled the room with his powerful presence. A tangible force radiated from him, a silent command that pressed against the very air. I, Naomi Fox, was just finishing my meager breakfast, steeling myself to explain the events of the previous day. But the words caught in my throat. Before I could utter a single syllable, he seized my wrist, his grip unyielding, and wordlessly ushered me out.

The sleek black car sliced through the frenetic energy of New York City. The urban landscape blurred past in a dizzying rush. Finally, the vehicle screeched to a halt before the imposing facade of City General Hospital. Walter Gonzalez only relinquished his hold on my wrist once we stood at Margo Weaver’s bedside. His voice, when it came, was a low, inflexible rumble.

""Apologize to Margo.""

I clamped my mouth shut, a stubborn line forming. Compliance was a foreign concept in this moment. My refusal manifested in the rigid set of my shoulders, the almost imperceptible tilt of my chin against the instinctive urge to submit. ""Why should I apologize for something I didn't instigate?""

I averted my gaze, unwilling to concede even the slightest fault. Disappointment flickered in Walter Gonzalez's eyes, a fleeting shadow that spoke volumes. An unspoken battle of wills raged between us, neither willing to yield an inch. It was Margo Weaver who ultimately intervened, her voice a saccharine melody laced with insincerity.

""Oh, poor Naomi,"" Margo cooed, her tone dripping with false concern. ""It’s such a shame how jealousy can consume someone so easily.”

""She's barely a year younger than you, Margo, and a grown woman. What's 'young' about that?"" Walter Gonzalez’s retort was sharp, the warmth in his expression abruptly extinguished. He fixed me with a piercing stare, his Alpha authority brooking no argument. ""Apologize. Now.""

The carefully constructed explanation I had prepared evaporated, scattering like dust in the wind. The hardened expression on his face told me that he had already passed judgment, declaring me guilty.

The apology snagged in my throat, choked by the weight of his disapproval. Those once-familiar eyes, which had held such adoration, now reflected only contempt. How swift and merciless the transition.

""Sorry."" The word was a hollow echo in the sterile room.

After what felt like an eternity of tense silence, I finally capitulated. Walter Gonzalez, however, didn’t appear triumphant. My abrupt shift in demeanor seemed to unsettle him.

I couldn’t bear to remain there, caught in the crossfire between them. I concocted a flimsy excuse to escape the suffocating atmosphere of the hospital room. ""I'm going to the restroom.""

The icy water splashing against my skin offered a momentary reprieve from the turmoil within. I stared at my reflection in the mirror, pressing my lips together in a tight line.

People invariably favor those they cherish, and Walter Gonzalez was no exception. Just as he had favored me, he now favored Delta Margo Weaver.

That's acceptable.

With that thought firmly in place, I turned and walked toward the door. As I approached, I noticed him standing nearby, a silent sentinel waiting for my return.

Just as I was about to pass him, Walter Gonzalez broke the silence. ""Margo is craving a sandwich from Ralph's Deli. I need to stay here with her, so would you mind going to get it?""

I paused, the question hanging in the air. After a beat, I agreed.

As we brushed past each other, his voice, laced with an undercurrent of something unsaid, reached me again. ""I'm going to mark Margo. It's best if you relinquish those… feelings.”

Hearing those words, I faltered but didn’t turn around. ""Don't worry. I already have. In a month, I'll…""

""I hope you mean that."" Walter Gonzalez cut me off before I could finish, his tone clipped. He turned and strode away.

I hadn’t gone far when I suddenly called out after him. “Do you really care for Margo that deeply? We’re the same age. If she’s worthy, why am I not?”

""Yes."" Walter Gonzalez turned back, his gaze a sharp warning. ""Anyone else is worthy, just not you! Don't ever mention it again.”

I nodded, acknowledging his command. ""Understood. I won’t.""

The afternoon descended into a cruel charade of errands, each delivery met with a fresh demand. Ralph's Deli, Bailey's Bakery – I traversed the city countless times, each return punctuated by Margo Weaver’s carefully calculated dismissals.

Breathless, I delivered the requested sandwich to Margo. But after a single, disdainful bite, she tossed it into the trash. ""The sandwich is stone cold. It's inedible. Never mind, Naomi. Could you perhaps fetch me a cupcake from Bailey's Bakery?""

Without a word, I turned, my gaze locking with Walter Gonzalez's. After a fleeting moment, I nodded. ""Very well.""

Bailey’s Bakery was geographically closer to the hospital than Ralph’s Deli, but no less a trial. When I finally returned, Margo again took only a small bite before rejecting it. ""Oh dear, I completely forgot to mention… I simply loathe this flavor.""

And so, I ran back and forth throughout the long afternoon until she finally ceased her fault-finding.

Thankfully, after that exhausting day, Walter Gonzalez didn’t request my presence back at the hospital. I assiduously avoided the place, thereby also avoiding Margo Weaver's torment.

That is, until I was fully recovered, and the day I was discharged. No sooner had I arrived home than a knock echoed through my small apartment.

""There's a reunion gathering,"" Margo announced, entwining her arm possessively around Walter Gonzalez’s. Her smile held a subtle hint of malice. ""You are coming, aren't you, Naomi?""

Walter Gonzalez, seemingly caught in the undertow of her machinations, appeared slightly uncomfortable but offered no resistance. Instead, he gazed at her with a fond expression. When he turned to me, however, the warmth vanished, replaced by a cold, resolute statement. ""Margo is thinking of your well-being. Don't make things difficult for her, Naomi.”

I forced a smile, suppressing the bubbling bitterness and self-derision, and offered a clipped nod of agreement.

# Chapter 3 - Crimson Shadows

The ""Crimson Night,"" New York's most elite haven for supernatural beings, throbbed with the rhythm of neon. Margo Weaver's entrance, escorted by Alpha Walter Gonzalez, sent ripples of excitement through the room, a stark contrast to my own unnoticed arrival.

Truthfully, the anonymity was a gift.

I chose a secluded corner, my gaze drawn to Margo as she soaked up the attention, Alpha Walter attending to her every need. He signaled for her preferred cocktail, gently placed his jacket around her shoulders when she shivered, and declared, his deep voice resonating through the room, ""Tonight, the celebrations are on me, in honor of my future Luna.""

Murmurs of envy rippled through the gathering.

""Did you see the way he looks at her? Like she's his entire world…""

""Who would have imagined the Ice Alpha capable of such tenderness?""

""They say he turned away his own Beta for her – that girl who used to be always by his side…""

""I always perceived Alpha Walter as somewhat cold in public, but witnessing this, it becomes apparent that even the most reserved individuals can display affection towards those they cherish.""

""Exactly. Any sighting of Margo and Alpha Walter together invariably makes the headlines. I aspire to find a connection like that.""

In the midst of the buzz, someone bravely inquired, ""Margo, your love with Alpha Walter is so inspiring. Any plans for the marking ceremony? We're expecting invitations!""

Margo blushed prettily, playfully tugging at Alpha Walter's sleeve. His eyes flickered towards me for a fleeting moment, but seeing me calmly nursing my drink, he quickly returned his focus to her with a loving smile.

""Soon. We’ve already begun to plan it.""

A chorus of cheers and well-wishes erupted.

Suddenly, a suggestion for a game was voiced, and I found myself pulled into the circle, along with calls for Alpha Walter to join.

I hesitated. ""Alpha Walter isn’t usually one for games.""

But Margo turned to him, her eyes pleading. ""Oh, come on, Walter. Just this once, for me? It's so much more fun with everyone.""

Succumbing to her charm, Alpha Walter agreed.

The first round concluded with Alpha Walter drawing the short straw. He flipped a penalty card that commanded: ""Kiss someone of the opposite sex for a full minute.”

Margo's cheeks flushed even deeper, and without a second's hesitation, Alpha Walter enveloped her in a passionate kiss, met by the roaring approval of the onlookers.

There was a time when a scene like this would have been painful, but I had moved on. Instead, I clapped along with the crowd, my smile genuine.

The minute sped by, and the following round saw me on the losing end. This time, the challenge involved revealing the top contact in my phone.

Without a second thought, I displayed my contacts, and instantly everyone noticed the entry at the top—Mate?!

A surprised gasp rippled through the group. ""Naomi, are you mated? Why haven't you said anything?""

I offered a smile. ""It's recent. You'll all receive invitations to the marking ceremony.""

As I slipped my phone away, my eyes briefly met Alpha Walter's. His gaze was intense, yet he remained silent.

Later, on my way to the ladies' room, I unexpectedly encountered Alpha Walter in the corridor, his expression icy.

""You dare to trivialize the sacred bond?” The wall behind me cracked, evidence of his barely controlled power. ""Prove it. Call him. Now.""

My fingers trembled slightly as I dialed the number. After several unanswered rings, the call diverted to voicemail.

""There's a time zone difference. He could be asleep,"" I offered truthfully.

Alpha Walter scoffed, ""Once a lie is revealed, there's no point in prolonging it. It only makes you look foolish. Naomi, stop with the charade.”

With that, he turned and strode away.

As Alpha Walter vanished down the hallway, my phone buzzed—Theodore Simmons, my Beta, was calling.

I answered, his voice warm with sleep.

""Sorry, Naomi. I was napping. What's up?""

Watching Alpha Walter's retreating figure, I sighed softly. Now wasn't the time for explanations.

I shook my head. ""Nothing, sorry to wake you.”

Theodore's voice was gentle, ""Naomi, you could never disturb me, no matter the time.”

""Oh, and the marking ceremony plans are coming together. You mentioned designing your own dress, right? Do you want it for the ceremony?”

I hesitated momentarily but then nodded. ""Yes.”

The next day, I went downstairs, but neither Alpha Walter nor Margo were around. I grabbed a quick breakfast and made my way to the bridal shop alone.

The pristine white marking dress hung silently on the mannequin as I carefully took it down and slipped it on. Gazing at my reflection in the full-length mirror, I felt a surge of nostalgia.

Years ago, I had poured my heart and soul into designing this dress, dreaming of the day I would wear it to mark Alpha Walter. Now I wore it again, but to mark someone else.

""Naomi?""

# Chapter 4 - The Dress and the Dismissal

A voice, laced with familiarity and a hint of disdain, sliced through the air behind me. I pivoted, my eyes landing on Margo Weaver and Alpha Walter Gonzalez, their expressions a cocktail of surprise and something akin to..........

By C.S. Lewis","Norah Jackson, trapped in a loveless marriage to an elderly husband, finds herself entangled in a dangerous game of seduction with her stepson, Quinn Jackson. As she schemes to secure her future by manipulating Quinn for his inheritance, she begins to uncover his hidden obsession with her. What starts as a calculated plan spirals into a twisted web of desire, betrayal, and forbidden emotions that neither can escape.

# Chapter 1 - My Stepson's Secret Obsession

""Stepson,"" I drawled, my voice dripping with a feigned languor as I watched my coffee topple, spreading a dark stain across the pristine floor. ""My back's acting up, and bending over is out of the question. Be a dear and clean that up, would you?""

Quinn Jackson, my stepson and infuriatingly, my age peer, flicked a glance at the lipstick mark I'd indicated with a manicured nail. He moved with that annoyingly graceful stride of his, crouching down near my legs, right by the edge of the sofa.

I was showcasing my assets in a figure-hugging skirt that skimmed just below my knees today. A strategic choice, of course.

As he leaned closer, I felt the whisper of his breath against my bare calf, a sudden chill prickling my skin. I forced myself to remain indifferent.

They say Quinn has always been harboring a secret crush on me.

They whisper that in moments like these, his suppressed desire is practically screaming, his body language giving him away.

But when I actually bothered to look at him, he was already smoothly handing me the lipstick-stained napkin and settling back into his armchair, burying himself in his newspaper.

Desire, huh? Didn't seem like it.

With a dismissive shrug, I decided a strategic retreat to the bedroom was in order for a ""nap.""

But then, from the corner of my eye, I caught Quinn subtly shifting in his seat. His legs crossed at an odd angle, and he leaned slightly to his left – as if desperately trying to conceal something.

...Interesting.

\[Attention: This is a story of awakening—a young housewife ready to seize control of her destiny. Her plan? To secure her future by claiming her stepson—and with him, the fortune that rightfully belongs to her ailing husband’s legacy.\]

\-----

I tied the knot with a man old enough to be my great-grandfather, a complete bore.

Finally, it looked like he was kicking the bucket soon, but he was planning on leaving everything to his precious eldest son Quinn, my stepson. Absolutely not! In a moment of desperation, I posted an online ad offering a substantial reward for anyone who could provide me with an heir, hoping to influence the inheritance in my favor by falling pregnant.

But just then, I noticed a stream of comments hovering in my vision.

\[""Isn't she pathetic? The perfect candidate is right in front of her.""\]

\[""Hasn't she noticed the way her stepson's eyes practically undress her?""\]

\[""Stepmom, step away from the disaster button! This villainess is about to unleash chaos!""\]

\[""Writer, please give this shameless hussy what she deserves!""\]

\[""Haha, I'm here for the scandalous twisty basement scenes\~""\]

I froze, startled, and shot a glance at my stepson, who had always been so impeccably polite and reserved.

""Stepmother, is something troubling you?"" The young man inquired with an unsettlingly warm smile.

I snapped back to reality. ""Huh? Oh, it's nothing,"" I stammered, forcing myself to break eye contact.

After a moment, I risked another peek in his direction. The comments were still there, multiplied now.

\[""Seriously, who would come up with such a ridiculous plan?""\]

\[""Honestly, shouldn't she be focusing on seducing the stepson instead of advertising for a baby daddy?""\]

\[""Writer, just off her already! I'm getting secondhand embarrassment.""\]

\[""Haha, I'm loving this train wreck. Watching a beautiful idiot get played by her seemingly innocent yet secretly manipulative stepson is pure gold.""\]

\[""Living under the same roof for seven years and still clueless about Quinn's feelings? She needs glasses... or a brain!""\]

I thought, ""…""

I honestly hadn't noticed.

Despite my husband's numerous flaws, he’d clearly done something right with his son. Quinn seemed almost too good to be true. At twenty-two, while most people are still sponging off their parents, he had already earned a master's degree and started taking over the company.

Elegant, courteous, and composed – that was what people said about him.

In our interactions, he never once stepped out of line.

For example, after asking if I was alright and hearing my standard ""I'm fine"" reply, he didn't press any further, even when he caught me staring at him again. He simply allowed it, remaining engrossed in his laptop behind his stylish glasses. His profile was striking, and his calm demeanor gave him an air of detached sophistication that made him stand out in this vapid world.

Could such a well-behaved man actually harbor desires for his stepmother?

No. It had to be my imagination running wild from too many late-night dramas.

I dismissed those floating comments with a determined huff.

But what if, just what if, there was a grain of truth to them?

# Chapter 2 - Accidental Thigh Touch

\[He was hauling enough stuff to fill a couple of those giant reusable bags from Whole Foods.\]

Quinn Jackson was practically flexing as he turned his head, making sure his jawline was on full display for his stepmother.

And knowing him, he was probably already plotting something.

I'd bet a king-size bag of Doritos he was online, frantically searching, ""Can stepmothers contest a will?""

Ah, family. Ain't it grand? Hahaha...

Okay, deep breaths.

I could feel my blood starting to simmer.

Time to see what we're working with here.

My gaze swept across the living room, finally settling on my favorite shade of red lipstick.

Feigning a reach for my coffee cup, I clumsily knocked the lipstick onto the hardwood floor. ""Quinn Jackson,"" I called out.

He looked up from his laptop, those annoyingly perfect eyebrows raised in anticipation.

""My neck's a bit stiff today; wouldn't you mind grabbing that for me? I can't really bend down.""

Quinn Jackson followed my pointed finger to the lipstick, and for a split second, that ever-present smirk flickered.

""Sadie—""

I cut him off smoothly. ""Don't bother Sadie Wood. You're right there, and by the time she gets over here, you'll have already saved the day.""

If Quinn Jackson refused now, it would definitely raise suspicions.

Our eyes met for a brief, charged moment.

He gave a barely perceptible nod. ""Fine.""

He unfolded his long frame from the armchair, strolled over, crouched low, and reached for the fallen lipstick near my legs and the edge of the sofa.

I'd chosen a pencil skirt today, a classic black number that hit just at the knees.

As he moved closer, I could feel the faint warmth of his breath against my bare calf, sending a tiny shiver dancing up my spine.

Stay cool, Evangeline. Stay cool.

My inner monologue went wild:

\[Hold up, is he trying to score points with the stepmom?\]

\[""From his vantage point, all he sees is a glimpse of pale skin, the hemline showcasing sculpted calves and delicate ankles. Like a marble statue come to life...""\]

Wow, even from the antagonist's perspective, I can see the appeal of Norah Jackson!\]

\[I'm half expecting him to get even closer.\]

\[It's happening. This is totally happening.\]

\[Someone's about to discreetly cross their legs\~\]

""Norah.""

His voice, low and smooth, jolted me back to reality.

I accepted the lipstick from his outstretched hand, my tongue darting out for a quick, almost imperceptible thank you. ""Thanks, Quinn Jackson.""

""You're welcome.""

He flashed that infuriatingly charming smile and went back to his seat, resuming his browsing.

And not a single sign of embarrassment. No flushed cheeks, no tell-tale redness creeping up his neck.

Like he'd simply picked up a pen, completely unfazed by the underlying tension.

What was that all about?

He was totally messing with me.

Maybe I secretly hoped for something to happen, so I wasn't as disappointed.

It was all just a bit of fun.

After all these years, if anyone knows Quinn Jackson, it's me.

What made me even entertain those ridiculous thoughts?

Feeling strangely unaffected, I decided to retreat to the bedroom for a nap.

But then, from the corner of my eye, I caught Quinn Jackson subtly shifting his position, crossing his legs.

He even leaned slightly to the side, as if trying to hide something.

...Huh?

# Chapter 3 - Stepmom's Got a Plot Twist

""I can't believe those chat commenters were right; Quinn Jackson really is sitting like \*that\*, haha!""

""Norah Jackson, you better haul yourself upstairs, pronto. Our dear Quinn Jackson is in dire need of a cold shower, stat.""

""Let's be precise, shall we? He needs to 'get' upstairs \*and then\* 'take' a cold shower. Two distinct actions, people.""

""Brace yourselves; expecting some grade-A, premium-level crazy today.""

...

And to think I almost dismissed those comments as utter rubbish! Turns out, they're disturbingly accurate.

Just to be absolutely sure it wasn't a fluke, I engineered a few more ""accidental"" opportunities to observe. Each time, the pearls of wisdom dropped in the comments became even more incisive, more eerily on point. Finally, I had to concede: Quinn Jackson is a walking, talking surprise package – like an Ikea flatpack with a hidden compartment full of extra, completely unnecessary screws.

Through these bite-sized nuggets of information, delivered courtesy of the internet's peanut gallery, I stumbled upon a truly earth-shattering revelation. Apparently, the world I inhabit is nothing more than a poorly written novel.

Quinn Jackson is the designated Big Bad, the primary antagonist.

And me? Well, I'm his tragically clueless stepmother, destined to make a series of spectacularly bad decisions that ultimately pave the way for his villainous transformation, before I'm unceremoniously written out of the story.

When I first read that, I had… thoughts. A lot of them.

Seven years. Does anyone have the slightest inkling of what these past seven years have been like for me?

Day in, day out, pretending to care for an ancient husband who could easily double as my grandfather, his skin resembling cracked tree bark, all while eagerly counting down the seconds until I could finally claim a substantial ""emotional distress"" windfall upon his inevitable demise.

And just when my long-awaited dream was about to materialize, the old fossil announces, with a dramatic cough, that he's leaving his entire fortune to his precious son, Quinn Jackson. All \*I\* get is the distinct honor of scattering his ashes.

Ha.

Who even cares about two pounds of powdered bone?

Can you even sell that for anything?

I was beyond furious, teetering on the edge of a complete meltdown at the prospect of ending up penniless.

Then, as if by divine intervention, I stumbled upon a trending news article: 【Woman receives five hundred million in alimony after getting pregnant out of wedlock】.

Maybe, just \*maybe\*, the same tactic could work for me?

I decided to gamble on it. After all, the old man's too far gone to know any better, and who's to say whose kid it is, really? I just needed to get my hands on that money first.

But before I could even begin to put my plan into motion, fate intervened, revealing that my original approach was utterly pointless.

It revealed a much simpler, far more efficient, and infinitely more reliable solution.

# Chapter 4 - The Accidental Seduction

The old man hadn't kicked the bucket yet. So, the inheritance was still just a blueprint, not set in stone. But Quinn Jackson, as the guy who was probably going to inherit everything, was already drowning in the social whirl........

So you think you want to be in a rockin’ band huh? You think you can handle the truth?

$150 to $350 per show is what you can expect to earn on tour with a B-Lister legacy rock band like Warrant, Sebastian Bach, Quiet Riot, Dangerous Toys, Stephen Pearcy, Enuff Z’Nuff, LA Guns, etc…

I’ve stepped in a few times with a number of these artists, and this has been the pay among my peers and myself.

What you receive as part of your contract depends highly on your reliability score and overall reputation within the music industry.

The truth is, the industry, especially for rock n roll, is dead. Labels don’t support or bother to help develop artists anymore… so there’s never any money to go around from cash advances.

I’m sitting here drinking coffee, scrolling the web, watching musicians complain and turn down amazing opportunities to work with great artists because “the pay ain’t enough…”

Hate to break it to ya, Kid… but you’re in for a world of surprises if you’re playing rock n roll for “the money”

Again, this is for Rock N Roll, B-Lister artists…

So if you’re just starting to tour, or you want to give touring a shot for the first time, and you get an offer to go out and perform for peanuts… take it. Cause truly that’s how you move up.

If it’s a small band with a bit of buzz, and they can offer you $40-$50 a night… consider yourself LUCKY in the rock industry.

If a band is staying in hotels, and offering you this kind of pay, they are likely one of few relevant artists who have a chance…

In other words, take the deal and GROW!

In conclusion: If you’re just starting out, quit moaning about money and learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable…

Don’t expect to make big bucks with a C-Lister artist… let alone a band that’s just starting out.

Hard pill to swallow, I know.
But it’s a beautiful life once you’re in.

TLDR:
B-Lister Rock Acts pay hired-guns roughly $150-$350 per show, based on credibility. If you’re just starting out, and you’re offered any kind of pay for a small tour… take it and run!

Learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable - this is the key to success.

One of the places she grew up in was in Wisconsin and she always talks about how much she loved the lake near her house and all the nature surrounding it. She’s very much a lover of the wilderness, finding peace in every little thing a part of it, so I thought she would enjoy a poem based on a life where she lives harmoniously with her version of a dreamy life. 

When I gave it to her, she loved it. Her tearful reaction made me so incredibly happy and grateful (as I’m honestly a bit insecure about writing poetry for others). What made it all the more special was when she said that what hit her the hardest about the poem was the line “this is it,” because her grandma’s house in Wisconsin— where she spent much of her time as a child growing up —  had a wooden sign posted near the driveway with those exact words on it. I never knew that, but that made me all the more grateful that I created this chance to give this memory back to her.

1lrd6na,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossMedsUK/comments/1lrd6na/side_effects_of_weight_loss_medication_a_complete/,Side Effects of Weight Loss Medication: A Complete Guide,"Weight loss medication can be a powerful tool on your journey, helping reduce appetite, improve blood sugar control, and support sustainable fat loss. However, like all medications, they can come with side effects. Understanding these, how to manage them, and when to seek help ensures you can continue safely while getting the best results.

Why Side Effects Happen

Weight loss medications often work by slowing stomach emptying and reducing appetite signals to the brain. This can naturally lead to changes in digestion, appetite, energy, and hydration, especially in the early stages. For most people, side effects ease over time as the body adjusts, but knowing when they are not normal is important.

Common Side Effects & How to Manage Them

1️⃣ Nausea

Why: Slower stomach emptying and appetite changes.

Will it pass? Often improves after a few weeks.

What helps:

Eat smaller meals, more frequently.

Avoid greasy, spicy, and heavy meals.

Eat bland foods (toast, rice, crackers).

Stay upright after eating.

Sip fluids rather than gulping.

When to seek help: If vomiting persists, dehydration signs (dizziness, dark urine, confusion), or unable to keep fluids down.

2️⃣ Constipation

Why: Slower gut movement due to medication.

Will it pass? Often improves as your body adjusts, but may need ongoing management.

What helps:

Increase water intake.

Eat fibre (berries, oats, veg) gradually.

Light movement (walks).

Consider a gentle over-the-counter laxative or fibre supplement if needed (speak to your pharmacist).

When to seek help: Severe bloating, persistent constipation despite management, or sudden severe abdominal pain.

3️⃣ Diarrhoea

Why: Change in gut motility.

Will it pass? Usually improves after initial weeks.

What helps:

Stay hydrated with water and oral rehydration solutions if needed.

Eat simple, low-fibre foods temporarily (rice, bananas, toast).

When to seek help: Signs of dehydration, blood in stool, severe pain.

4️⃣ Heartburn or Acid Reflux

Why: Delayed stomach emptying can cause acid to stay longer.

Will it pass? May improve, but may persist for some.

What helps:

Eat smaller meals.

Avoid lying down immediately after eating.

Avoid trigger foods (coffee, spicy food, chocolate).

Discuss antacids or medication with your GP if persistent.

When to seek help: Severe or persistent reflux, pain swallowing, weight loss without trying.

5️⃣ Bloating & Gas

Why: Slower digestion and gut bacteria changes.

Will it pass? Often improves over time.

What helps:

Eat slowly and chew well.

Avoid carbonated drinks.

Gradually increase fibre.

When to seek help: Severe, persistent bloating or pain.

6️⃣ Fatigue

Why: Reduced calorie intake, dehydration, and adjustment phase.

Will it pass? Usually improves after initial weeks.

What helps:

Ensure adequate hydration.

Eat small, nutrient-rich meals.

Gentle movement.

When to seek help: Extreme fatigue, dizziness, fainting, or weakness.

But her 20th birthday was coming up, and I knew she wasn’t expecting anything. She’d even texted me, “Gonna celebrate my big 2-0 by doing laundry and avoiding people. Wild, right?” So I did what any mildly lovesick, occasionally reckless almost-seventeen-year-old would do — I planned a trip. Took the bus. Told her roommate I was coming. And two days before my birthday, I stood outside her dorm with a cupcake in one hand and the dumbest grin on my face, waiting to knock.

She opened the door in an oversized hoodie and messy bun, clearly not expecting anyone — especially not me. For like three solid seconds, she just blinked. Then: “What the actual hell are you doing here?”

“Just thought I’d crash your birthday. You’re welcome.”

She tried to act annoyed. Failed instantly. The smile took over her face before she could stop it. “You’re such a little menace,” she said, pulling me inside — and then she hugged me. Like full-on, arms-around-neck, face-in-my-shoulder kind of hug. I’d dreamed about that moment so many times, and it still hit harder than expected.

“You smell like bus station,” she muttered against my shirt.
“And you smell like bad decisions and iced coffee,” I whispered back.
“God, I missed this,” she said.
“What, my scent or my personality?”
“Unfortunately, both.”

The next two days were a blur of late-night walks, pizza runs, inside jokes, and her dragging me around campus pretending not to enjoy showing me off. She kept calling me “the child,” because she had two days on me. I kept calling her “grandma,” because it drove her crazy.

On the night before my birthday, we sat on the floor of her dorm with a single cupcake and a flickering tea light candle, and she looked at me with this mock-serious expression. “So tomorrow… seventeen. You’re practically legal. Should I be worried?”

I raised an eyebrow. “Worried you won’t be able to resist me? Yeah. I’d be nervous too.”

She laughed, full-on this time — that unfiltered, head-thrown-back laugh I’d missed so much. “Wow. Turning seventeen really boosted your ego.”

“Nah,” I said, leaning a little closer. “Just being around you does that.”

She didn’t back away. Didn’t roll her eyes. She just looked at me with that same spark I remembered from the tutoring room — maybe a little softer now, a little more dangerous. “You know this is still technically illegal in like… half the country.”

“But not this one,” I whispered.
She blinked. “You really looked up age of consent laws for this visit?”
“Maybe.”

We laughed, hard. It was stupid and bold and a little chaotic — and it was us. Perfectly us. The line was still there, sure. But it was blurry now. Softer. We were older. Closer. Everything had changed — and somehow, nothing had.

On the day I turned seventeen, she kissed me on the cheek and said, “Happy birthday, you annoying little punk,” and I swear it was the best present I’ve ever gotten. I don’t know what we are. Not yet. But whatever it is, it’s ours.

And it’s just getting started.

1lrd3nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifehack/comments/1lrd3nb/the_discipline_system_that_finally_worked_for_me/,The discipline system that finally worked for me - DO NOT rely on motivation anymore,"I used to wake up scrolling Instagram, skip workouts, binge YouTube until 2AM, and beat myself up for having “no discipline.” I bought habit trackers, downloaded a dozen productivity apps, even tried writing letters to “my future self.” Nothing stuck. I was chasing motivation like it was a drug - and it always wore off.

If you’ve ever set goals and watched them crumble by Tuesday, you’re not alone. I want to share what finally worked for me - not some Pinterest aesthetic routine, but a gritty, real-world mindset shift that actually changed my life.

It started with one brutal realization: I wasn’t lazy. I was addicted to dopamine spikes.
Doomscrolling, TikTok loops, DoorDash meals - they were all giving me tiny hits of satisfaction that trained my brain to avoid effort and delay. But the thing that saved me? Daily reading and a discipline-first mindset - even when I didn’t feel like it. Especially when I didn’t feel like it.

Once I stopped chasing “motivation” and treated discipline like brushing my teeth - non-negotiable - I got scary productive. Not perfect. Just consistent enough to transform how I work, think, feel, and show up in life.

Here are some brutal but powerful truths that helped me build real discipline:

Motivation is dopamine. Discipline is identity. Build habits that reflect who you want to become, not just what you want to achieve.
Track streaks, not perfection. Missing once is okay. Twice becomes a new habit.

Temptation bundling works. I pair tasks I avoid (reading academic papers) with things I love (coffee shop vibes or lo-fi beats).
Make it frictionless. Put your gym clothes next to your bed. Keep your Kindle on the kitchen counter.

If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now. This rule cured my procrastination.
Treat distractions like addictions. I log apps I use mindlessly and replace the habit loop.
Your brain resists change, not effort. Push through the discomfort - it means growth is happening.

My therapist once said, “You can’t think your way into new behavior. You behave your way into new thinking.” That quote literally rewired how I approach discipline.

Here are some resources that truly helped me shift from chaos to clarity - especially around building discipline without motivation:

Atomic Habits by James Clear: Bestselling book that’s everywhere for a reason. Clear (pun intended) framework to actually build habits that stick. This book made me realize success isn’t one huge transformation - it’s 1% changes, repeated daily. Probably the best habit book I’ve ever read. Life-changing.

Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins: A raw, intense look into mental toughness. Goggins went from obese to Navy SEAL and ultra-marathoner. It’s not for the faint-hearted, but if you want to feel lit up and unstoppable, this is it. I listened to the audiobook while running -it changed my pace and my mindset.

Deep Work by Cal Newport: This book made me delete 80% of the apps on my phone. Newport explains why shallow distractions kill your potential - and how to train your mind for focus again. A must-read if your attention span’s been fried.

The Tim Ferriss Show podcast: The GOAT of productivity interviews. Tim reverse-engineers the habits of top performers, and you’ll walk away with actual tools - not just fluff. His episodes on morning routines and decision-making completely reshaped mine. Great to listen to while commuting or meal prepping.

BeFreed: Kept seeing people recommend this smart learning/book summary app and finally gave it a shot - because honestly, I’m too busy to finish full books these days. You can pick how deep you want to go: 10-min quick summary, or 20-40+ min deep dive. You can choose the tone: formal or humorous and they even let you clone a loved one’s voice to read to you. I tested it with a few books I already knew, and ngl, 90% of the key insights were there. I’ve finished more books in the past 3 weeks than I did all last year. Total game-changer for rebuilding focus.

Forest: This one helps me stay off my phone by growing a virtual tree when I stay focused. Weirdly addicting and super effective. Gamifies discipline like Duolingo but for your attention span.

Matt D’Avella’s youtube channel: His minimalism and discipline videos feel like calm therapy + actionable tips. The one about ""How to Get Your Life Together in 30 Days"" legit kickstarted my whole reset. Perfect if you're starting from zero.

Discipline changed my brain. Reading rewired how I think. And learning to act without “feeling like it” gave me a superpower most people spend their lives waiting for.

We live in a world where it's easy to be average - scroll, consume, repeat. But if you build discipline when no one’s watching, it shows up everywhere - how you talk, walk, think, and even love. And trust me, that version of you? Worth every hard moment.

## What is PoundPilot AI?

PoundPilot AI is essentially an **automated trading platform** that uses artificial intelligence to analyze market data and execute trades on your behalf. The goal? To help traders, whether rookies or pros, capitalize on market fluctuations without being glued to their screens 24/7.

Think of it as your personal trading assistant that never sleeps. It scans multiple markets, including cryptocurrencies, forex, and stocks, looking for profitable opportunities based on patterns, trends, and real-time data. The AI’s job is to reduce the guesswork and emotional stress that often comes with trading.

## Who Created PoundPilot AI?

The platform was developed by a team of **financial experts, AI developers, and seasoned traders** who wanted to make trading more accessible and efficient.

Their background in algorithmic trading and AI programming is evident in the smooth performance and responsive interface. It’s not a random startup—it’s backed by people who understand both finance and technology.

## How Does PoundPilot AI Work?

PoundPilot AI leverages **machine learning algorithms** that digest huge amounts of market data to identify trading signals. Once it spots a potential trade, it executes orders automatically using pre-set strategies and risk parameters.

Here’s the gist:
- The AI analyzes market trends, price movements, volume, and even news sentiment.
- It generates trading signals based on this data.
- Trades are placed automatically to capitalize on short-term price changes.
- Users can customize risk levels and asset preferences to suit their comfort zone.

What’s great is that you don’t need to be a trading whiz to use it. The AI does the heavy lifting, though having some basic understanding of trading will definitely help you make the most of it.

## PoundPilot AI Pros and Cons

Like anything, PoundPilot AI isn’t perfect. Here’s what stood out to me:

**Pros:**

Overall, it strikes a nice balance between sophistication and accessibility.

You’ll need to start with a minimum deposit of **$250** to activate trading on PoundPilot AI. This is fairly standard among similar platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge.

I was a top influencer. He had acquired the MCN agency I signed with.He blocked my collaborations, snatched away my brand deals, and shut down my livestream channel—all because his new girlfriend said, ""Her face bothers me. I don't like it.""Well, I'm a cancer blogger. How good is someone supposed to look when they're dying?\*\*\*Right after the pre-Thanksgiving stream ended, my assistant, Alicia Hayes, came in with bad news.""Gabriella! I'm so pissed. Mr. Caillet replaced you with Sandra on the ad contract again!""My heart sank. I swallowed the pain, forced a smile, and tried to calm her. ""Let it go, Alicia.""But she refused. ""Again? How many times now? Do you even want to live? So what if you dumped him first? He moved on right away anyway!""I cleared my throat, lowering my voice, trying to stop her.But she glared. ""No. I'm going to Liam's. I'll tell him you're—""""Alicia, don't!"" I grabbed her hand. ""I'll talk to him myself. Okay?""Just then, the executive assistant pushed open the livestream room door.""Gabriella, Mr. Caillet wants to see you. Now.""My heart jolted. It was the first time he called for me since acquiring this MCN agency.Standing outside Liam's glass office, my hand froze mid-air, unable to knock.Seeing his cold profile sent a chill through me. My heart trembled.I forced myself to stay calm and knocked.As I walked in, the first thing I saw was a framed photo on his desk—him and Sandra Sullivan at their college graduation.The day I broke up with him, he accepted her confession. That day became their anniversary.Just as my thoughts drifted, Liam slammed a file onto the desk.""Take a look. Your account data. Five months straight, under 8,000 dollars. Give me a good reason.""I glanced down. The bolded line at the bottom stabbed like a knife.""Beauty Influencer, Gabriella Rochon. Followers, 1.32M. Streams, 52. Conversion rate, 3.2%.

Every stream pulls tens of thousands of viewers, but you cut off tipping and stopped giving me brand deals...""""Gabriella."" Liam suddenly called my name, cold and sharp, cutting me off. He looked down at me like a king addressing a subject. ""So you're saying this is my fault?""I froze, speechless.""Isn't it?"" I thought.Liam let out a cold laugh. ""Gabriella, you really think you're important enough for me to target?""The words hit like a boomerang, punching a hole straight through my chest.All the bitterness came rushing in, unstoppable...Three years ago, I broke up with Liam.That proud man, almost 1.9 meters tall, had bent down, begging me not to leave.And I said, ""Liam, you think you're someone worth staying for?""Honestly, from the moment I left him, I never thought about today.""Starting today, we're taking back your account. Gabriella, your contract has been terminated.""His voice was as cold as ice. He didn't even bother lifting his eyelids when he dropped the verdict.My body stiffened. I could barely breathe.""Liam, please... just give me a little more time. I'll prove my value. I can make money for you...""The word ""money"" seemed to hit a nerve.He let out a mocking snort, finally lifting his eyes to glance at me. ""Gabriella, you think I need your pocket change?""He suddenly straightened, lips tight, eyes darkening with hatred.""Gabriella, you know what? If I could buy a life with money, I'd spend it just to see you dead.""Chapter 2It felt like a bullet tore through my chest. The pain almost made me cry.I knew he hated me. But I didn't think it ran this deep.I couldn't blame him. I had pushed him into hell when he needed me most. Of course, he hated me.Liam's father was a narcotics officer. His biggest dream was to wear his father's badge again.At 18, he got into the police academy. But to save me, he fought with some thugs, got arrested, and ended up with a permanent stain on his record. Dream over.At 22, he was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy. In and out of the ICU five times, six critical notices.Before his surgery, he asked to see me one last time. I thought it was just another way to make me stay. So I told him, ""Liam, whether you live or die has nothing to do with me.""Now, facing the disgust in his eyes, I clenched my teeth. I had no words left.I owed him.My dry eyes blinked hard. My voice dropped to barely a whisper. ""Let me finish this month. Please.""I lowered my head, hoping this pathetic plea would move him.In the end, all I got was...""Get out. Five days. Don't show up again.""Gripping the termination papers, I stiffly walked out of his office. The cold air conditioner wrapped around me like an icebox.Suddenly, a wave of metallic heat rose in my throat.I rushed into the break room, pulled out my cancer painkillers, and swallowed them with cold water.After a long while, I leaned against the wall, barely holding on. Then I pulled out my phone, snapped a close-up of the termination papers, and posted it on my backup account.""Day 1038 of fighting cancer. My beloved first love just fired me. Five days till unemployment.""The truth is, I was diagnosed with hereditary bone cancer three years ago. My five-year survival rate was less than 20%.The moment I posted it, my followers flooded the comments.""Marmalade, you're the bravest cancer blogger I follow. Since you're unemployed now, just take a break and rest.""""Fired by your first love? I thought you said he was just a broke college student?""That comment hit me like a punch in the chest.I used to think we were both poor. Until after we broke up when he got together with Sandra.That night, fireworks lit up the whole city.Everyone knew—the heir of the Caillet Group, Liam, was officially dating.Later, I saw a screenshot posted on the campus confession wall—a chat between him and someone else.The person asked why he pretended to be poor.He replied, ""I used to fake being broke to keep gold diggers away. But I'm not worried anymore. The one who tried gave up on her own.""Bitterness filled my mouth. My heart ached.At some point, Alicia appeared. She patted me gently, worried. ""Gabriella, are you okay? You look pale. Should we go to the hospital?""I forced a smile and shook my head. ""I'm fine. Just...""I handed her the termination papers. ""Just... I won't be able to work with you anymore.""Alicia snatched the papers, read them twice, and burst out in anger.""Liam is a bastard! Who does this kind of petty revenge? Kicking you when you're down—he's not afraid of karma? Does he even realize cutting you off is basically killing you?""Ignoring everything, Alicia grabbed my hand and dragged me out, heading straight for Liam's office. Suddenly, we stumbled into a noisy crowd.Sandra stood there in a white dress, handing out wedding invitations and a bag of candy to everyone.When she reached me, she smiled smugly. ""Gabriella, you have to come to witness our wedding! After all, you're the one who brought us together!""Wedding?Liam's getting married...Chapter 3My blood froze. My throat tightened.I forced a smile, my voice hoarse. ""Then I wish you and Mr. Caillet a lifetime of happiness.""The words scraped my chest as I took her wedding invitation and candy.The next second, Liam appeared. He snatched it from my hand and tossed it straight into the trash.Without even glancing at me, he grabbed Sandra's hand, interlacing their fingers.""My wedding isn't open to just anyone.""His words landed like a hammer on my chest. The office went dead silent. Everyone exchanged awkward glances. Alicia tried to step in, but I pressed her hand down.I watched as Liam, hand in hand with Sandra, disappeared through the door. One by one, the others scattered.When the noise faded, only Alicia and I were left.I bent down and slowly picked the candies out of the trash, one piece after another.Chocolate, strawberry, milk...But not a single apple.That year, at the top of the Ferris wheel, after kissing me, he said, ""From now on, I'll only eat apple candy.""He didn't love me anymore. Not even a little.A bitter smile tugged at my lips as tears fell, splattering on the candy.I clenched the candy in my fist, pressing it against my chest, trying to hold back the pain ripping through me.But it wouldn't stop.Alicia pulled me into her arms and brought me back to my rented place near the cancer hospital.When she brought me boiled eggs, I was writing ""Bet Agreement"" on a piece of paper.Alicia frowned. ""Why are you writing this?""I carefully folded the paper and smiled faintly. ""Even though Liam kicked me out, I want to give it one last shot. I want him to see my worth. That I can make him money.""Alicia stared at me in disbelief. ""How?""""By doing battles. I'll top the gift rankings.""I had prepared so many ways to convince Liam, yet none of them were needed.After reading my bet agreement, he only said one thing, ""If you don't know how to give up, I don't mind teaching you.""His eyes were sharp enough to pierce through me. I could only smile bitterly.""What are you smiling at?"" His voice was full of hate.I just remembered the time he taught me how to ride a bike—his tone was exactly the same.The memory stabbed my bones, but all I said was, ""Thank you, Mr. Caillet, for giving me this chance.""\*\*\*That night's stream, I was ready to go all in.No filters. Harsh lighting. Bare face. Full-on clickbait.The moment I went live, I shot straight to the top of trending.""Beauty Guru Gabriella Goes Filter-Free—AI-Level Queen Stuns the World!""I thought Liam would pit me against some big influencer or A-list celeb.I never expected it to be Sandra.No time to be shocked. I snapped into host mode, greeting the hundreds of thousands flooding into my stream.As I applied intricate designs on my face with my makeup tools, my ranking on the gift leaderboard soared—straight to an overwhelming first place!Meanwhile, Sandra's stream struggled—barely 10K viewers.There was no doubt. I was going to win.Even the chat was telling me to go easy on the rookie.But then, in the final 30 seconds, Liam suddenly dropped into Sandra's stream—blasting 999 rockets at once!My hand shook, the eyeliner pen slipping—red ink staining the white of my eye.In a blink, Sandra shot past me on the leaderboard.The results flipped instantly. I lost to her by a thousand points.Sandra smiled, calm and smug.Following the rules, she randomly picked a punishment from the comments. ""Since you lost, Gabriella, your punishment is to kiss the control guy for three seconds!""The poor tech intern—a fresh-faced guy—blushed as he was pushed in front of the camera. I could hear his heart pounding from a few meters away.He avoided my gaze, clearly flustered. I couldn't help but tease, ""Got a girlfriend?""He froze, then shook his head fast. ""No... never even dated.""This would be his first kiss.I looked at him, a little guilty. Part of me wanted to just give up.What did it matter? I had already lost my job.I didn't want to drag an innocent kid into this.I glanced up at him, apologetic. ""Sorry, I—""Before I could finish, the intern suddenly grabbed my waist, leaned in, and kissed me—warm breath brushing against my lips.The comments instantly exploded.""OMG! Queen and young boy! This is so sweet!""""I'm jealous of the intern! I'd trade my whole life to kiss a queen like her!""Then—BANG! The studio door flew open.In the middle of the frenzy, Liam stormed in, face like a thundercloud. Without a word, he grabbed my wrist and dragged me out!Chapter 4Liam yanked me straight out of the studio.He sneered, his cold eyes stabbing into me.""Gabriella, Andy is my cousin. You? Kiss him? You think you're worthy?""His words nearly tore my heart apart.The moment our eyes met, his hatred almost crushed me.I rubbed my wrist, red from his grip, blinking back the sting in my eyes. ""Sorry. I didn't know who he was. I was just playing by the rules.""Right then, a tall figure stepped in front of me, blocking him. Andy Caillet squared up to him.""Whether she's worthy or not, I'll decide. Don't touch her, Liam.""I froze, staring at Andy's back. My gaze slid past his shoulder—Liam's eyes locked on me, the chill in the stabbing straight into my heart.""Andy, what do you even see in her? Greed? Schemes?""Andy shot back, voice tense. ""So what, Liam? You got hurt once, and now you see ghosts everywhere?""And stop harping on profit. The Caillet family's loaded—we couldn't spend it all in ten lifetimes.""With that, he grabbed my hand and brushed past Liam.Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw his face stiffen.Once we were outside, Andy let go of my hand and, feeling apologetic, tried to explain.""Gabriella, Liam lost control because he once pretended to be poor, dated a scholarship girl, and got burned. Don't take his words to heart.""""Yeah."" I forced a small smile, pretending I was fine. I didn't tell him—I was that scholarship girl.Thinking I didn't believe him, Andy continued softly, ""Liam was crazy about her. He even tattooed her name over his heart. Later, he had surgery to get the skin replaced.""""He thinks she's disgusting. I think she's bad luck too."" His gaze burned into me. ""But you're different—""Pain surged in my chest, unstoppable.The tattoo on my right atrium with Liam's name seemed to ache too.Peeling skin, carving flesh. It must've hurt like hell back then.I swallowed my tears and cut Andy off.""Thanks for helping me out today. Colleagues, after all.""That one word, ""colleague,"" choked whatever he was about to say. His eyes, bright a second ago, dimmed instantly.I turned and left him standing there.By the time I packed my stuff and went to HR to process my resignation, the HR rep threw a voluntary resignation form at me with a cold face.""Mr. Caillet agreed to terminate your contract at the end of this month. If you leave now, it's voluntary. No severance.""My mind went blank. I couldn't afford to lose that money. Treatments, and meds—they expensive. I couldn't touch my savings either.I changed my mind on the spot. ""I'll finish out the month.""Only four days left. I couldn't afford to be stupid about money.The HR woman sneered, glanced at the coffee nearby, then ordered, ""This is for Ms. Sullivan. Mr. Caillet ordered it. Since you've got nothing to do, deliver it.""On the coffee bag was Liam's handwritten note.""Less ice, less sugar. Cut back on coffee, sleep more.""The words were warm. Once, that warmth was mine too.I grabbed the coffee and headed to Sandra's office.As I walked, old memories crept back.I remembered his phone, packed with notes about my favorite things.""Gabriella likes watermelon and hates vinegar. Loves strawberries, but not strawberry-flavored candy...""A mix of sadness and bitterness welled up inside me.Did he take notes on Sandra's likes too? Did he brew hot tea for her during her period? Massage her stomach? Did he hold her and sing to her when she was down?Then I felt stupid.She was his fiancée. The one he chose to spend his life with. Of course, he did. Probably gave her even more.My eyes stung.I shook off the discomfort, knocked on her door, and walked inside.""Ms. Sullivan, your coffee, from Mr. Caillet.""She reached out, then suddenly froze. Her sharp gaze locked onto my slightly open collar.I looked down, following her eyes—there it was. The tattooed Liam on my chest.Chapter 5I instinctively tried to pull my collar up, but Sandra yanked my hand. ""Gabriella, showing off your tattoo so Liam can see it, huh?""I wanted to deny it, but she didn't care and continued, ""You think flashing that tattoo will make him fall for you again? Or maybe let you stay in the company?""My throat tightened.""I never thought that. No need to be so aggressive.""""Thought? Do you think you're even worth it? You wish!"" She sneered, her voice sharp. ""Liam told me—being with you back then was just practice. Don't flatter yourself as some hard-to-get first love.""The smile vanished. Her eyes turned venomous, cold like a snake.""Don't believe me? Try it.""I didn't want to try. I didn't want to fight. I just wanted to finish my last four days quietly and leave with my money.I shook off her hand, set down the coffee, and turned to leave.But then, Sandra grabbed the coffee and flipped it over my head. The cold brown liquid drenched me from head to toe.Even without ice, it still felt like standing in a freezer.I stood there, taking it, not moving until the last drop was gone.Shivering, I asked, ""Can I go now?""She tossed the empty cup at me and smiled, satisfied. ""Go ahead. But a reminder—sort your trash properly. Garbage belongs in the trash.""A heavy weight pressed on my chest, my breathing rough.I said nothing and turned around. As I looked up, Liam walked in.The moment our eyes met—he saw everything. My pathetic state, laid bare.His jaw clenched, his eyes dimmed, and cold disgust crept in.That sharp stare cut straight through my heart like a blade.My throat tightened. I suddenly wanted to cry.Just then, Sandra grabbed a cup of hot water behind me and splashed it onto my back!The burning pain made my spine arch. I staggered.She ran into Liam's arms, acting all innocent. ""Liam, I just couldn't help it. She's so disgusting to look at.""His cold gaze swept over me.Moments later, he spoke. ""Yeah. Pretty damn unlucky.""An overwhelming sadness crushed me.Thoughts spilled out, ""I'm dying of cancer. How good am I supposed to look?""Why me? Why cancer? Why did I have to see Liam again?""And now, I had to watch him flirt with the person who hurt me the most!""My chest tightened. Suddenly, I coughed up blood.Dizziness hit, and I collapsed.\*\*\*When I woke up, I was already lying on a hospital bed.I forced my eyes open through the searing pain, hearing loud arguing outside the room.Looking up, I saw my doctor, Hubert Davis, slam a fist straight into Liam's face.""Liam! Do you even care?! When I handed Gabriella over to you, what did you promise me? You said you'd take care of her!""He was furious, eyes bloodshot, voice trembling.""And now you just let Sandra bully her? Do you even know she has cancer...""Liam wiped the blood from his mouth and suddenly locked eyes with me.My breath caught. Then I heard him say, ""She's the one who kept throwing herself at Sandra. You didn't mind taking my leftovers—fine.""But whether she lives or dies—it's none of my business.""Chapter 6Every word cut deep, making it hard for me to breathe.Liam withdrew his cold gaze and turned to leave.Hubert glanced back, saw my misery, and asked softly, ""You heard everything?""I said nothing. He stepped closer, trying to comfort me.""Gabriella, I just feel bad for you...""I cut him off. ""Hubert, I'm tired. Can I be alone for a bit?""He hesitated, then said, ""Alright. But if you feel bad, call me. I'm here.""I smiled. ""Thank you. I troubled you before, and now I'm still troubling you.""Hubert was my and Liam's senior in college.When we first met, he didn't know I was dating Liam and confessed to me.Liam once saw him as a rival.To avoid trouble, I kept my distance. But three years ago, when I was diagnosed, I found out he was my doctor. That was how we reconnected.Life is always this unpredictable.Maybe I was just too heartbroken. And jobless.This time, my illness came fast and hard. The pain kept hitting. I couldn't even get out of bed, let alone be discharged. Painkillers stopped working.I threw up blood all night and ended up in the ICU.After five days of emergency care, I got a little better and moved to a regular room.When I could finally check my phone, I instinctively opened my beauty account.It had been renamed to ""Liam and Sandra""—now a couple's vlog for them.Their first video? Posted on October 22.The title? ""Wedding Prep Diary: Trying on the Dress.""That day used to be me and Liam's anniversary.Sadness swelled inside me. I didn't even dare to click the video. Instead, I opened my cancer account and posted.""Day 1,042 of fighting the tumor. My three-year-old channel was wiped clean by my first love. Suddenly, I wonder—after I die, will he erase me from his memory too?""My hands trembled. I couldn't type anymore.Liam was so cruel. He turned our anniversary into Sandra's. He was still the male lead. But I was no longer his heroine.\*\*\*It was the 20th day of my hospital stay.Hooked up to IV nutrition, I suddenly got my appetite back.Hubert said, ""That's good. It means your body's bouncing back. Eat whatever you want. You need strength to keep fighting.""I thought of my favorite: Dante's Ravioli.After giving me another shot, Hubert finally let me leave the hospital alone.I knew what he gave me—morphine.I forced myself to the shop. Workers were tearing down the sign. The bold ""Dante's Ravioli"" letters had smashed into pieces on the ground.I found the owner. ""You're closing?""He sighed. ""Yeah. Someone offered 500,000 dollars to buy the place. He said this shop holds too many disgusting, filthy memories. He wants to tear it down and turn it into a dessert café.""I immediately thought of Liam.Dessert cafés were Sandra's favorite.My heart ached like a fine needle—sharp, but faint.The owner glanced at my skinny frame and swollen belly. He spoke kindly, ""Ma'am, craving ravioli because you're pregnant? The kitchen's still here. I can make you one last plate.""I held my belly and shook my head.""Thank you. I wish you a lifetime of peace.""I used to think ""lifetime of peace"" sounded corny. But now, standing at the end of my life, nothing means more than peace.I turned to leave, never telling him I wasn't pregnant. It was ascites.Before leaving, I snapped a photo of the message wall and posted it on my cancer account.""Day 1,057 of fighting cancer. I came to the ravioli shop I used to visit with my first love. The message I once wrote—""Let's ride the last train of happiness together till the end""—is gone...""He's shining in happiness now. As for the last train... I got on alone.""Chapter 7Back at the hospital, the ascites pain was unbearable.Hubert rushed to get me a treatment order, then stayed with me as we headed to the ultrasound room.In the waiting hall, I ran into Liam and Sandra.Liam was holding an ultrasound report. Sandra clung to his arm, resting her head on his shoulder.""Liam, do you think our baby will be a boy or girl? What should we name it?""Without thinking, he said, ""As long as it's not called Lilla. That name's disgusting.""It felt like a knife slicing straight through me, sharper than the stomach pain.Lilla was the name I once picked for our future child.I gripped Hubert's hand tightly. ""I don't want the scan anymore. Take me back.""But before we could leave, Sandra spotted me. ""Gabriella?""She pulled Liam along, hurried over, and glanced at my swollen belly, surprised. ""It really is you. What a coincidence!""Gabriella, are you pregnant too? How far along?""Hubert tried to speak for me, but I stopped him.I stared at her belly and asked back, ""And you?""""Just three weeks,"" she said sweetly, hugging Liam. ""No wonder you quit your job so suddenly! You were hiding it so well.""I was about to explain, but Liam sneered coldly, his voice sharp as ice. ""Of course, she hid it. Shameful things always get hidden.""At that moment, my heart went completely numb. Even the pain seemed to vanish.Strangely, I felt free. Like I finally let go.I forced a smile. ""Mr. Caillet, not everyone shares your hobby of hiding things.""I was hinting at how he once pretended to be poor.He caught it, scoffed, and didn't bother to reply. He pulled Sandra away.Before they got far, I suddenly coughed up a mouthful of dark blood.Hubert panicked, catching me. ""Hang in there!""But I couldn't anymore. Everything faded to black.\*\*\*When I woke again, I was back in the ICU.Half-conscious, I vaguely heard Hubert talking to someone.Helpless and full of regret, he said, ""Her body can't handle surgery anymore. This is the end. I won't let her die on the operating table...""In my head, I silently agreed, ""Yeah. I don't want to go on a cold, steel table.""Soon, his voice came again—this time, filled with anger.""Liam, don't you want to know why Gabriella broke up with you back then? If you really want to know, come to the hospital tomorrow. I'll tell you!""""I'm not interested.""Liam's reply was cold and distant. I shivered.That night, fireworks lit up the whole city.Lying in bed, my dry eyes stared up. I wondered, ""Who's celebrating love tonight?""Maybe countless couples were sealing their first kiss under this grand display.Just like Liam and I once did.I couldn't help but murmur, ""It's so beautiful.""Even more beautiful than what we once saw. Back then, he promised me a fireworks show just for me. But he gave it to Sandra instead.In the next second, Sandra's name exploded in the sky.Silver sparks burst into a sea of stars.I let out a bitter smile. ""So, it's Liam again,"" I said inwardly.He really did love Sandra.Alicia, who was by my side, held my hand. ""Gabriella, don't look.""Her eyes were swollen and red. ""If you like fireworks, I'll set off a bigger show for you next spring. But you have to get better, okay?""Hubert quietly appeared too, standing in front of me, cursing under his breath, ""That bastard Liam.""I looked up at Hubert and forced a faint smile.""Hubert... I want to go home.""He stayed silent for a while, then finally agreed, his voice low, ""Okay. I'll take you home.""It was the first time he didn't try to persuade me to hold on. But his smile looked worse than crying.Chapter 8The day before discharge, I raised my phone with shaky hands and snapped a photo of the monitor by my bed. It read, ""Gabriella Rochon, 28 years and 28 days old.""Then I opened my cancer account. I wanted to crop out my name. Maybe write something.But I was too weak. My finger slipped and hit send.Hubert arrived. Today, he wasn't in a white coat. He wore a white shirt, just as he did when we first met.""Alicia went to get the car. I'll carry you over.""I didn't have the strength to respond. I just gave a pale smile.He carefully scooped me up. I leaned quietly into his broad, warm chest.His heart was pounding. Fast and strong.The rhythm was oddly calming. It made me sleepy.""Gabriella, don't sleep. Stay with me.""I smiled faintly, fighting to keep my eyes open. I thought, ""I won't sleep yet. I haven't said goodbye to Liam... not properly...""I won't sleep. But I'm so tired. And it hurts so much.Maybe if I sleep, the pain will go away.Just for a little while... a little while...\*\*\*At the end of the hallway, Liam saw Gabriella asleep in Hubert's arms.His face instantly darkened.He thought he must've lost his mind for listening to Hubert and coming here for the so-called truth.As Liam turned sharply to leave, those pale hands in Hubert's arms suddenly went limp...He didn't see it. He didn't hear Hubert choke out, head lowered, ""Rest in peace, Gabriella.""Back at the office, Liam summoned his assistant.""Blacklist Gabriella!""Any company that hires her—crush them!""She played him again. This time, she'd pay!Three days after Gabriella was blacklisted, her cancer account suddenly hit the trending search.""Cancer Blogger Marmalade Stops Updating, Suspected to Have Passed Away. Netizens Dig Up First Love: Suspected the Caillet Group CEO, Liam Caillet!""Liam saw it too. He frowned and clicked into the account.""Day 1020: Doctor says it'll hurt more as it progresses. But I still want to hold on.""""Day 932: A fellow patient passed today. He said his biggest fear was being forgotten. But me... I hope my first love forgets me, yet I fear he really will. Am I stupid?""""Day 133: Do you know why my username is Marmalade? Because his favorite fruit is orange. The doctor says my condition is terrible. But I'll fight this rotten body to the end!""""Day 10: Broke up with my first love. His family's just as poor as mine. I can't drag him down too.""\*\*\*The more he read, the more familiar it felt. The ""first love"" in her posts was him.Just then, his office door opened.""Mr. Caillet, while sorting through our accounts, we found that Gabriella's ID is linked to another account—Marmalade. It's the same one trending right now.""",1,1751615348.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1lrczaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1lrczaw/the_discipline_system_that_finally_worked_for_me/,The discipline system that finally worked for me - DO NOT rely on motivation anymore,"I used to wake up scrolling Instagram, skip workouts, binge YouTube until 2AM, and beat myself up for having “no discipline.” I bought habit trackers, downloaded a dozen productivity apps, even tried writing letters to “my future self.” Nothing stuck. I was chasing motivation like it was a drug - and it always wore off.

If you’ve ever set goals and watched them crumble by Tuesday, you’re not alone. I want to share what finally worked for me - not some Pinterest aesthetic routine, but a gritty, real-world mindset shift that actually changed my life.

It started with one brutal realization: I wasn’t lazy. I was addicted to dopamine spikes.
Doomscrolling, TikTok loops, DoorDash meals - they were all giving me tiny hits of satisfaction that trained my brain to avoid effort and delay. But the thing that saved me? Daily reading and a discipline-first mindset - even when I didn’t feel like it. Especially when I didn’t feel like it.

Once I stopped chasing “motivation” and treated discipline like brushing my teeth - non-negotiable - I got scary productive. Not perfect. Just consistent enough to transform how I work, think, feel, and show up in life.

Here are some brutal but powerful truths that helped me build real discipline:

Motivation is dopamine. Discipline is identity. Build habits that reflect who you want to become, not just what you want to achieve.
Track streaks, not perfection. Missing once is okay. Twice becomes a new habit.

Temptation bundling works. I pair tasks I avoid (reading academic papers) with things I love (coffee shop vibes or lo-fi beats).
Make it frictionless. Put your gym clothes next to your bed. Keep your Kindle on the kitchen counter.

If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now. This rule cured my procrastination.
Treat distractions like addictions. I log apps I use mindlessly and replace the habit loop.
Your brain resists change, not effort. Push through the discomfort - it means growth is happening.

My therapist once said, “You can’t think your way into new behavior. You behave your way into new thinking.” That quote literally rewired how I approach discipline.

Here are some resources that truly helped me shift from chaos to clarity - especially around building discipline without motivation:

Atomic Habits by James Clear: Bestselling book that’s everywhere for a reason. Clear (pun intended) framework to actually build habits that stick. This book made me realize success isn’t one huge transformation - it’s 1% changes, repeated daily. Probably the best habit book I’ve ever read. Life-changing.

Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins: A raw, intense look into mental toughness. Goggins went from obese to Navy SEAL and ultra-marathoner. It’s not for the faint-hearted, but if you want to feel lit up and unstoppable, this is it. I listened to the audiobook while running -it changed my pace and my mindset.

Deep Work by Cal Newport: This book made me delete 80% of the apps on my phone. Newport explains why shallow distractions kill your potential - and how to train your mind for focus again. A must-read if your attention span’s been fried.

The Tim Ferriss Show podcast: The GOAT of productivity interviews. Tim reverse-engineers the habits of top performers, and you’ll walk away with actual tools - not just fluff. His episodes on morning routines and decision-making completely reshaped mine. Great to listen to while commuting or meal prepping.

BeFreed: Kept seeing people recommend this smart learning/book summary app and finally gave it a shot - because honestly, I’m too busy to finish full books these days. You can pick how deep you want to go: 10-min quick summary, or 20-40+ min deep dive. You can choose the tone: formal or humorous and they even let you clone a loved one’s voice to read to you. I tested it with a few books I already knew, and ngl, 90% of the key insights were there. I’ve finished more books in the past 3 weeks than I did all last year. Total game-changer for rebuilding focus.

Forest: This one helps me stay off my phone by growing a virtual tree when I stay focused. Weirdly addicting and super effective. Gamifies discipline like Duolingo but for your attention span.

Matt D’Avella’s youtube channel: His minimalism and discipline videos feel like calm therapy + actionable tips. The one about ""How to Get Your Life Together in 30 Days"" legit kickstarted my whole reset. Perfect if you're starting from zero.

Discipline changed my brain. Reading rewired how I think. And learning to act without “feeling like it” gave me a superpower most people spend their lives waiting for.

We live in a world where it's easy to be average - scroll, consume, repeat. But if you build discipline when no one’s watching, it shows up everywhere - how you talk, walk, think, and even love. And trust me, that version of you? Worth every hard moment.

I’m in Tokyo until the end of August and staying around Akasaka/Roppongi. It’s a wild, beautiful, neon-lit place—but let’s be real, it can also feel weirdly lonely for such a huge city. So here I am, breaking the social ice on Reddit like a true millennial.

I’m looking to meet some friendly faces—whether you're a local, expat, or fellow wanderer. Want to grab a coffee, lunch, or just talk about how confusing Japanese convenience store sandwiches are? I’m game.

No pressure, no weird vibes—just chill conversation, some caffeine, and possibly debating which konbini is the superior one (Lawson supremacy, anyone?).

If you're in or around Akasaka/Roppongi and feel like meeting up for a low-key hang, feel free to comment. Bonus points if you know a good café that doesn’t cost a thousand yen for an espresso the size of a thimble.

# GOOD BYE MALTA



ARIANA’S POV\~



“My father is a beast, yes I said it, a beast and a terrorist, a rapist and every other evil and vile thing the criminals do in Italy! I hate him” I said, holding the paper in my hands and shaking with anger as I ruffled it and threw it to the floor.



“I hate home, and I never want to go back, my life since moving to Malta has been nothing short of beautiful, the handsome waiter I met last week, finally wants to take me on a nice date, somewhere fancy but instead I've been summoned home by my father,” I said as I threw my handbag to the couch and slumped into it. 



“TONIGHT!” I screamed, “And that ASSHOLE will also be there”



My cousin and best friend in the world, Fiona sat beside me as I cried continuously.



“If you refuse this, I'm sure you will be dragged to the plane” she said, sounding sorry for me as she picked up the paper to read its content. 



“I thought when my father said ‘Do whatever you want, I don't want to see your pathetic face around.’ He meant it, what could this man need me for, I'm done with that life, I want to be done Fiona” I cried into the couch pillow.



“Look on the bright side, at least he will unfreeze the account now, and we can pay for the apartment we wanted, just go to the party, and come back, it's just tonight right, it doesn't say you have to sleep over,” she said rubbing my shoulder lightly before lying on it.



“I know it's hard girl, but you will get through it, c’mon let's help you get a dress, you are still the beautiful eccentric Ariana Rinaldi, you have to stick it to your stepsisters, you know they will be there, with their gawking eyes,” she said ruffling my hair and pulling me to stand on my feet, 



Which I did reluctantly.



“I don't want to go, I wish I could tell them a train hit me or something” I said, shaking my head in protest.



“Not a chance, come on, let's go to La Perla Maltese boutique” she said, coming to pull me to the door.



3 hours later I was heading home to Italy to attend this party my father had decided to throw for my asshole adopted brother Matteo.



His name sent waves of pure irritation down my spine as I shrugged the thought of him from my mind. I hate him, with every fibre of my being, he is an asshole and I'm glad everyone sees it now.



A rotten bastard, my father would call him in secret, so why is he throwing this elaborate party for him and why should I be in the midst of all these old vile men?



I picked the invitation that had visibly been crumbled badly, and straightened it again, I read its content again, this time more clearly



You are cordially invited to an evening of intrigue and indulgence at the estate of the esteemed Don Vincenzo Rinaldi.



date: 30th of January 2023



Time: midnight until dawn



Location: Villa Rinaldi, nestled away amidst the shadows of Marina Verde.



Dress code: black for men, women are free to choose what enthrals them, with a hint of mystery.



Join us under the shield of the night, as we celebrate loyalty, life and the bonds of our fraternity. Revel in the finest cuisine, exquisite wines Sicily has to offer, and the temptations of forbidden pleasures.



But remember, within these walls, restraint is paramount, and the currency of the night is secrets, trust only those you know, for treachery carries severe consequences



The Rinaldi Family.



I looked at it with annoyance, these fake parties these men throw just to show who is more powerful, I was immediately disgusted.



It used to be my father, but now it seems Mateo is the new hotshot Don in town, calling all the shots, and my father didn't like it.



That must have cut deep into my papa, so why would he throw this party in his honour? And why do I have to be there?



Not after the last time he and my stepmother tricked me into offending Papa so much that I had to decide to leave Italy.



My father is like a vulture, he waits for you and then strikes.



Long after, I stepped out of the plane that I’d finished the process and I was home free.



All I could imagine was how I'd react to meeting that lying asshole again, and how fast I can't wait to get out of there.



My dad just picked the wrongest day to do this to me!



Just when Enzo finally asked me to be his girl, something I’d been hoping for. 



I walked past the baggage claim and headed for the airport door.



As the door opened I took a deep breath, let out all the negative thoughts in my head and embraced a positive aura.



I smiled and as I did, a man carrying a fan passed me blowing the invitation from my hand.



I shrieked and leapt for it, I caught it before it could fly off and I steadied myself to land.



As I did I landed in the firm grip of a male airport police officer, his grip was much too tight to be friendly.



“Let go of me! what is this?” I inquired, my heart suddenly beating out of my chest.



“Are you Ariana Rinaldi?” he asked, looking intently at me, I looked at him in fright. 



Do I deny my name right now or is this one of Papa’s men?



I decided to go with the daunting hope that it was the former.



“Yes, I am, what the hell is this?” I asked, jerking my arm from his grip, I watched as two female officers joined him, the blond one reached into her pocket to bring out what I hoped she was not!



“You are under Arrest for conspiring with Italian criminal and mafia don, Mateo Donatelli, to intentionally distribute hard drugs, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law” the male officer announced, gesturing to the blond officer to place the handcuff.



“What! He is just my adopted brother! I don't know anything about this!” 



But they didn't care, I was already getting hurled out and tossed into the police car.



I haven't even properly landed, Mateo, you slimy piece of shit, and I already want to murder you!







# MY BROTHER, MY OLD FOE







Mateo’s pov\~



“Who arrested my useless daughter?” I heard my adopted father, Don Vincenzo Rinaldi thunder as I walked into his office.



I stood far from his line of sight, I was not going to soil his mood further just when he was about to acknowledge me among the brotherhood.



“What do you mean! What?” he yelled again slamming his cane on the glass table shattering it.



I knew something would happen the moment I called Interpol officer, Pius Asissi’s bluff, it was good fun, something to irritate my father but I didnt know he would blow it out of proportion.



He slammed the phone on the table, turned and lunged at me almost immediately.



“You bastard! You got my daughter arrested!” he growled, “fix it! You get her out and bring her back here tonight! I will not be ridiculed by the other families, calling me weak for not putting my house in order! Or worse think im a snitch! Get her out and quietly, Or else you can kiss your recognition goodbye” he added before releasing my shirt and throwing me against the wall.



I clenched my fist in anger and my jaw tightened next, but I gathered myself and smiled casually at him. “Consider it done” I replied, calmly walking out of his office.



As I closed the door behind me, the anger started to well up inside me and I stormed out of the mansion.



Julius my caporegime, noticed my mood and followed closely behind.



“Is he going to be a problem Don?” he inquired taking a glance at the mansion one last time before opening the door for me.



“My father is a demon, yes, but this is not one of those days, this is about my annoying sister getting arrested and Pius Asissi’s inability to take a fucking joke” I grinned.



He turned over to the other side and got into the car, before gesturing to the driver to start the car.



“Sir what are your orders’ he asked, straight to the point, his loyalty was the same as it was with my biological father Don Donatelli.



He passed away when I was seventeen and coincidentally I got adopted by the same person he warned me never to trust.



“We need to get her out and bring her back here” I started, “tonight, or else he is going to pin something on me and make me look like a criminal again, I can't afford that”.



I started to ask myself, knowing Pius to be a logical man if blowing this out of proportion meant he wanted something. I needed to figure it out.



“Set a meeting with Pius, he and I need to talk” I added.



6 hours later he flew in from Albania, delaying me for a reason.



“ what do you want pius? Name it, but I need you to hand over the girl in your custody, she’s a menace I need to be done with” I started, standing across from him in front of the airport police department.



“My bosses are tired of your father, we want him out” he mentioned, crossing his hand



“They want or you want? I know how blackmail goes officer Asissi” I mentioned casually.



Pius snickered and clapped his hands together.



“That’s how I know you are the right guy, however, you are the one to do it, get it done, we want your father out of the game” he declared, “deal?” he asked looking at me.



I stopped and threw a glance at Julius, he only stared back.



“Deal” I responded.



“Great, I'll be in touch, let me know when the time is right, for now, Miss Ariana is in the interrogation room waiting for you to take her home” he smiled, walking past me into the facility.



I couldn't believe it, they are just as sick of his shit as I am.



I suddenly felt a rush of power flow through me, I felt like I could conquer.



The only one standing in my way was my bastard half-brother Emiliano, so I made him disappear.



I took a deep breath as I relaxed my raging mind, I made a deal to betray my stepfather, to save my annoying sister from prison.



She has not changed at all, always disrupting my plans to conquer.



But today I refused to engage in her petty attitude.



Her full, Sharp mouth stirred a man to anger.



As I stepped into the hallway leading to the interrogation room, I stopped in front of the door.



I readied myself for the self-loathing little bitch I've always known at the other end of the door.



I stepped back a little as our eyes suddenly met.



A beautiful woman with long flowing hair, soft hazel eyes and lips full like plum looked back at me as I opened the door.



I was awestruck, this can't be Ariana!



Just as I was about to concoct words to speak, she poured a cup of warm coffee on my face.



“You slimy piece of shit!” she yelled. “You got me arrested!”



“Relax, there was a communication error, it's all been handled, and you are free to go” I mentioned, I watched her flare up and she started for the open door when suddenly she slipped on the coffee she spilt on me.



Like a reflex I was pulled to sweep her off her feet, I held onto her and swung her away from the spilt coffee.



She was dumbfounded, obviously none of us was expecting that.



“Are you okay?” I inquired,



“Just take me home” she replied with a flustered face, moving past me and out of the room.



The sweet scent of her luscious hair still hanging in the air.



I complied willingly, a few minutes to midnight I had safely dropped her off in front of her father’s mansion.



I waited for her to go in before going in.



I hadn't gone very far when I heard a conversation in the hallway.



“Wow, I like your dress, so simple, it fits you, are you going for the virgin look, do you think ours is slutty?” her step-sister Serena. asked looking at the younger sister Luna who was looking down at her bare chest, visibly open to expose the fullness of her breast, she wore a sultry-looking red gown that showed her curves.



“No Serena, you both look good, I'm just on my way to the sitting area to wait for the party to start,” Ariana replied in defence.



“Mom, I think Ariana is brushing us off, and acting like a prude to gain Father’s favour” Luna said.



“No, you both look Good, I just prefer this style of clothing, it's not a big deal okay?” she reassured, trying to move past her sisters.



“Oh so you are brushing it off, so you do think my girls are slutty!” their mother retorted



I watched her take deep breaths.



This was amusing, I was invested in watching how it would all play out.



“Take it off, give it to Luna, I want her to wear it,” her stepmother said softly but clearly, making me wonder sometimes if she was on some sort of meds.



Should I step in? Is it worth it?



I'm an asshole after all.



“Excuse me?” she asked looking at them, “no that's not going to happen” she retorted.



Luna moved to her back and started to unzip her clothes slowly.



I watch in amazement, right in the hallway.



Not only have I been thinking about what she would look like outside that yellow frock dress, on my bed in Milan.



I get to see it….



Serena soon joined her and together they helped her undress until she stood silently in the hallway with her panties and silk bra.



I was too far to see and Serena blocked off my view.



I could feel her suddenly feel embarrassed.



“Best hurry up and get dressed, it's almost midnight the guests have started to arrive, sweety, welcome home” Maria smiled moving past her gently, the smell of her choking French cologne filled the air



Then we heard voices, she quickly bolted with the red dress in her hand and hid in one of the corners, I peered from the corner and saw her father walking into the hallway.



someone was with him, his consigliere Luchi.



I'm fucked how do I explain this.



I peered again, I saw him walking off into another room, I bolted to the open door opposite where I hid.



As I ran my eyes caught someone, a woman, her soft brown eyes scanned me as I froze for a moment in her beauty.



Her skin was supple and I never knew she had a beauty mark close to her belly button.



Ariana….







# A NIGHT I SHOULD SOON FORGET



 



Ariana’s Pov\~



There he is again, in the shadows, peeking and lurking as always.



He hasn't changed a bit.



The sight of him irritated me I couldn't linger, I walked past him after a nice heartfelt “congratulations”



I may be wearing just my undies but I'll make damn sure I move past him in demure.



“You haven't apologised for pouring that distasteful coffee at me”



I ignored him.



He grabbed my arm and pulled me to him, “don't walk away from me when I'm speaking Bambino” he said holding my face in his big gruff murderous hands.



I pushed him and he grabbed me again.



“You asshole let me go” I grunted trying to free my arm from his strong grasp.



“Why? Why should I let you go? you have grown over the years” he said looking at my chest and licking his lips.



I used all my strength to evade him as I yanked myself free and bolted.



A deranged Asshole, he smelled like alcohol too.



Thankfully far away from him, I went into a spare room to change into the red gown.



I straightened the red fabric to hide evidence from the scuffle with my step sisters earlier.



The leaders of the other family soon arrived, The old family la Famiglia Nera family was present, their leader Don Antonio Argento and his wife Liana, with their children their son Silvio Argento and his sister Sophia as well as 3 other women whose identities I didn't know, arrived much later but separately.



bodyguards stood close by as well.



Another family just as ruthless as mine and Mateo’s.



Silvio looked in my direction, he didn't smile, but his eyes fixed on my chest, my breasts full like plum, he rummaged my body with his eyes in very uncomfortable ways and I immediately wanted the earth to open up and swallow me.



My father spoke first and picked up his wine glass,



“Welcome to Villa Rinaldi, today is a peaceful day because for once, for more than 10 years the 3 families are at peace” he said holding his glass to chest level, his glass resting on his burly body.



The others raised their glass, one of the three women who came in, one was American, an outsider and everyone gave her distasteful looks occasionally.



“Matteo “the shadow” Donatelli,” my father said as he tapped him on the shoulder and squeezed hard which made mate readjust himself on his seat.



“Like a son to me, I remember when you came to me after your father’s accident, sad and alone, devoid of life, but now look at you! You are now a Don in your own right!” he laughed softly and everyone followed in his delusion, everyone knew it was just a ruse to maintain his godfather status and keep Mateo on a leash.



I saw Luna signal my attention as she spun around slowly in my blue dress, I was instantly angry, she looked like she had been thrown inside my gown, her sister would not even stay with her most of the party, to avoid being photographed with her.



I hate today, I hate this party, I don't want to be here.



I watched for a little while as the Argento family and members of mine gathered around Mateo to congratulate him, It would be disrespectful if I stood there and did not congratulate him in front of my father.



So I gathered myself and walked to him, I stopped a few inches in front of him, but also enough distance away from his grasp, “Congratulations Don Matteo,” I said unexcitedly.



Mateo's pov\~



I watched her expression, she faked her smile, but she looked breathtaking in that red gown.



I had this primal urge to devour her right here, but she’s my adopted sister.



This isn't right, though I was irresponsibly drunk I did my best to make sure It was unnoticed.



I had my American woman Becky on my arm. 



She looked at me, and she gave me a warm smile, this was the first time she’d met my family.



“Baby doll, thank you, is that all you are going to say, bambino? We have an unfinished business sister ""I said looking at her, my eyes kept going over her body, and I wondered if Becky was pretending not to notice.



I raised my head, looked down at her full chest and licked my lips again.



She gave me an irritated look, her pretty face in a full scowl, the only thing that had changed about her was her beauty.



Who the hell is this radiant woman standing before me?



It can't be Ariana…. My annoying sister?



I felt deep hate for her, not after the lies she spread about me back in school.



Unfortunately leading to the suicide attempt of her friend Chiara, I never lived it down.



Now her family has burdened me with her care forever, all because of Ariana.



“Excuse me, Don Matteo, I'll take my leave now” she replied gently, I raised the cup to my mouth and looked at her with those devilish green eyes of mine, and I watched her hurriedly flee from my presence.



I watched her go, each step she took accentuated her curves in ways I never noticed before.



My head was spinning, but this primal urge to have her was winning.



She walked around before noticing her stepmother shoot dagger eyes from across the room where she sat talking with Liana Argento, and I knew it was her cue to leave.



I saw her grab the bottle of champagne from one of the tables and head upstairs to her room.



I couldn't let her go, she called to me, just like she did when we were teens and we would sneak around.



The silent and wicked invitation to play in her room.



Is this one of them or is this the alcohol?



I had to know I had to find out, my head was spinning out of control.



my eyes felt like they would close but I was on a mission to find out exactly why she keeps teasing me with those hateful doe eyes of hers.



“Baby? Are you okay? You look like you need a seat my love” Becky started, putting a hand over me.



“I'm okay, I guess I drank way too much,” I replied, kissing her lips softly.



“I'll be right back, stay right here, I should pour some water on my face, then I'll be okay” I noted.



I got up and lost my footing a bit but I readjusted my gait, and I stood tall.



“You want me to come with you?” she asked.



“No,” I cut in almost immediately. 



“Stay here”



I watched her face turn to worry, but she obeyed me and wouldn't dare challenge me, not on a very significant night like this.



I gathered my drunk self and I started to walk towards the stairs.



I was starting to zone out, but I had to maintain my composure until I was well away from prying eyes.



I had to know Ariana. Are you a clone?



When did you get to look so good, why haven't I had time to notice?



All this while she’s been in Malta, hiding from me.



Soon I got to her door, when I heard chatter.



I heard her laugh at the other end “I wish I was back in Malta Fi” she mentioned, before hearing a loud thud on the bed.



My senses were heightened, I pressed my ear on the door and I could hear the faint voice replying to her over the phone.



“I know girl, it's just for tonight okay, after that we finally get our peace, the apartment Is just 1 step away,” her friend said calmly.



“Tell me what happened when you saw him,” she inquired as she giggled.



Ohhhh interesting…. This is about me.



How long has she been thinking about me?



“Still a scoundrel Fi, you know how much I hate him” she replied to her, I heard her kick something.



A scoundrel? Me? Don Matteo Donatelli, heir to the feared powerful Famiglia Donatelli Mafia!



Unacceptable.



I heard her unzip her gown, the sound of it drove me instantly insane.



I burst the door open, the door almost flew from its hinges, I stepped in and closed it behind me.



I stood by the door and watched her scamper to cover herself from my lustful gaze.



“Let me call you back Fi,” she said discontinuing the call as she tried to zip back up the gown I kept eye fucking.



“What are you doing in my room, please leave, yours is next door, if memory serves me right” she stated brazenly as she gestured to the door “Please leave”



I looked at her for a little while, my eyes fixed on her body, I could feel this was going to end badly.



“Mateo.. Please lea..” as she spoke I walked up to her, frantically she looked around, grabbed her wine glass from her dresser and threw it at me, i ducked immediately but I could see I upset her.



“You called me a scoundrel”



I soon reached her, grabbed her neck and pushed her gently against the glass window. 



“So mouthy,” I said almost faintly, my breath reeked of alcohol and I didnt care. 



I pressed my lips to hers and kissed her with so much intensity she had to push me away with all her strength.



I was hungry for her, like a wild beast about to devour.



“Mateo get out of my room” she cried but the music was too loud and I was too intoxicated to understand logic.



She ran towards the door but I grabbed her just in time and pressed her face to the glass window again.



“Where are you running off to Bambino?” I pressed myself against her and I could feel the hardness of my cock against her ass.



“I've been looking at you all night, only you, I like this red dress on you, I want to rip it off you and fuck you till you beg me to stop” I whispered into her ear.



The hair behind her head stood as they felt my raspy breath.



I knew she wanted me to, pretence is her best tactic.



“Stop this Mateo! You are drunk get off me you asshole” She tried to free my arm behind her but I had her pinned good on the window.



We could see from the window, her sister Serena with someone outside, but I couldn't take a closer look.



I was much too distracted by this goddess before me.



“Let's play a little game like we used to,” I said, unzipping the rest of the gown with one hand and pinning her down with the other.



“I don't want to play your stupid games, let me go Mateo” she cried again shaking herself free.



“No need to run bambino” I said as my hand pulled her gown free and it fell to my feet. 



With my knee, I spread her legs further apart.



Her arms are still pinned behind her.



I pressed myself some more into her body as I used my free hand to touch her boobs before releasing it from its cups.



“Mateo” she whispered as I flicked her nipples. 



“Please stop this”



“No my sweet doll, I want to fuck you until you beg me to stop,” I said, I traced my finger around her thongs before moving down towards her shamelessly moist pussy.



I touched the wet moisture and played around with her pussy for a while, she let out a small moan and I could tell she regretted it as her eyes started to fill with tears.



I brought my fingers to my face and licked it.



“See how wet you are for me, you have been thinking of me haven't you?” 







# SAVED BY MY DOLL







ARIANA'S POV\~



An hour later, Mateo walked out of my room without so much as a backward glance.



the past 1 hour of my life had been a whirlwind I chose never to revisit, but I can't help but think that my body will not soon forget.



This man who just left so casually after violating me, as I held on to my pillows, sweaty and naked on my bed, my hair badly ruffled and the sheets torn beyond recognition.



What just happened? Did I let this man do this to me? I just surrendered, just like Chaira did,



I felt so sick to my stomach as a sudden feeling of nausea overtook me.



This asshole, heartless bastard has just taken my virginity.



Like it was nothing! 



I boiled inside me, I clenched my pillow tightly as I cried into it, I hate him so much, I wish he would die!



I quickly gathered myself from my bed and went to the bathroom to soak myself in my own self-loathing.



Moments later, I heard a loud knock on the door. I tied my towel and went out, curious to find who was at my door.



“Open the door” my stepmother’s loud voice called, fear ripped through my entire body as I heard that cold tone.



Did she see Mateo leave my room?



I opened the door gently, though wishing the door would magically fall and land on her head.



She stepped in, looked around and shook her head when she saw the champagne on the counter.



“Did you leave the party your father and I took out time to plan to come and drink yourself to death in your room. How ungrateful! You are nothing but a roach, you deserve nothing but crumbs” she said as she waved her hand in my face,



I was quiet with my head down, her ramblings weren't new to me, and she was the least of my worries.



Seeing that I gave her no reply she stopped yapping.



“Your father has requested your audience in the main room, he hopes you will not come looking like the cheap whore that you are,” she said before stepping out of my room.



I closed the door behind her, I leaned against the wall, why can't I go unnoticed in this family?



Even when I try to leave their presence they always find me, It never ends



A few minutes later I was wearing my plain clothes since the red dress was ruined and Luna had stolen mine.



I went down to the main room, where my father looked visibly upset about the modesty of my dressing but he gestured to me to stand beside him which I did.



my father rarely did this unless he had an announcement to make as a family.



My father adjusted himself again and started to speak.



“ well! you all have heard the rumours and you know why I have called you here, today will be a very historical moment in our family's long line of business and brotherhood,” he said gesturing towards me to stand in front of him.



“This is a formal announcement to strengthen the bond of our union and of our families, the Argento and Rinaldi families have betrothed their children Silvio and Ariana to be married to keep the peace and for some peace to continue salute” he finished



“papa…” I started, and he turned and shot me deadly glares, glares all too familiar.



What? I'm engaged? Silvio Argento is no different from Mateo, he looked at me earlier as though he was going to dissect me.



I was too scared to confront my father, all I am to him is a bargaining chip for his gain, and that's what it has always been.



I froze, I felt everything around me spinning out of my control, I could hear my heart beating uncontrollably, as the sound of cheers faded out,



how did it get to this? I'm supposed to be on my way to Malta!



I soon realized I could never go back to Malta, I was going to be stuck here, I was getting married to a bloodthirsty killer like Mateo, and ill be another bitter mafia wife.



the life I've been avoiding was laid right in front of me and my father had thrown me to the wolves.



What will he do when he finds out that I'm no longer a virgin? My hands started to shake anxiously as I clenched my dress over my things.



I watched as Silvio walked in my direction. He is a very tall and handsome Man I must admit, he looked gentlemanly with his blond tinted hair. but he is no better than Madman Mateo.



He stopped at my side and put a flower in my hair. he took my hand and pulled me close to his chest. “You are mine now, Ariana” he whispered in my ear.



That shot coldly fit through my body, he touched me lightly and I quickly pulled away.



Mateo smiled at me cheerfully, as he walked towards Silvio and me, his teeth visibly showing, “congratulations Silvio, and to you sister” he said casually as though he had not just taken my virginity just an hour ago In my bed, he leaned into me and planted a soft kiss on my cheeks and my face almost turned red.



My heart sank! Congratulations? From him!



my life is over.



Mateo got up and clinked his glass, “I also have an announcement to make” he said as he swung his American friend in the air and dropped her in front of him.



He brought out a box and offered it to Becky, she opened it and her mouth flew open and her eyes stuck out, the glow of joy suddenly filled her face as she brought out a shiny diamond ring from the box.



“Becky will you be my wife” he asked, she made a dramatic happy dance, she screamed a loud resounding yes and everyone erupted in another round of cheer.



I don't understand what's going on here, Did he just propose?



I started to fidget, my anger started to tear me apart internally as I felt this burning rage inside me like a volcano about to erupt.



“I guess there's no time better than any to tell you this!” Becky smiled holding her fiance’s neck and swinging from side to side.



“I'm pregnant!” she screamed, Mateo’s face changed and he lifted her in the air and spun her around.



“Ah congratulations Mateo,” my father said tapping his shoulder again.



This night was the worst night of my life, I tried to avoid Silvio’s gaze all night and focused on the ruthless bastard who seemed to have violated me for sport.



I cursed him continuously as my heart ached in deep pain that shot through my body like electric jolts.



He didn't even as much as look at me the rest of the party.



I wanted to leave again, but not before I caught the glance of a shiny object someone was taking out of their leg pocket.



I saw one of the girls earlier who I didn't know, walking stealthily towards Matteo, so she was behind him. I tried to signal him but the chatter and the music wouldn't let me be heard. Maybe I'm wrong.



I saw her raise the knife slowly at his back. I sprang up in a sudden bid to save him. I picked up my father’s cane he was using to support himself beside me, and I threw it in Mateo’s direction. 



“Mateo! Behind you!”







# A HAPPY DAY







MATEO’S POV\~



Just as swiftly as I heard Ariana’s voice, I turned around in time to catch the knife mid-air before it landed in my back, i hit it out of the hand of the brunette-haired girl that had escorted Silvio’s sister Sophia to this party, my “FATHER” threw for me.



I quickly incapacitated her and grabbed the kitchen knife on the feast table and grabbed her hair, my bodyguards seeing this quickly armed up and pointed their guns at the Argentos.



They feared no one, after all, I paid them heavily just to fear no fucking person.



I knew my enemies would come, I expected it and I'm Always ready.



Taking sips and Pretending to be drunk all night has been fun until I really got drunk, I slipped up and now I can't remember the last hour and a half.



Silvio’s bodyguards had also drawn arms and faced me and the Rinaldi family, and in retaliation theirs also drew arms. 



, the entire room was now still as all three houses were now armed and fully ready for war, I smirked, I thought we had come for a peace pact.



“Don Argento, you mind explaining this?” I asked as I raised the girl by her hair to face the argentos, I waved my knife in the air before placing it on her neck.



Don Argento and Silvio looked at Sophia who was now behind her brother, for an explanation.



“I don't know who she is, my assistant didn't show up and she is a last-minute hire, you know how I have to always have an assistant, papa” she cried, looking at her family with teary eyes.



She understood well that she had pissed off her dad who slapped her effectively as the words left her lips.



Another dumb bitch, her father faced me “We are not associated with this woman, and so you can take her and do whatever you want with her” he said coldly.



“I can?” I asked sarcastically, drunk and looking around the room with her hair firm in my clutch, the woman didn't beg for mercy, she was mute, except for the times she would groan from the pull on her hair.



I raised her to the level of my shoulders, her feet hanging in the air, “who sent you” I asked her, but she didn't reply and it irritated me badly, she was willing to die to protect her employer, so be it.



I faced the assassin Ariana who had called my attention to her.



I smiled and in one swift movement I slit her throat, and I watched the horror wash through Ariana’s face,



the bitch who made people call me a girl killer back in school has made me a girl killer again.



I threw the lifeless body of the assassin on the floor, her blood-stained my finger, still maintaining eye contact with ariana I licked my fingers and then erupted in a loud cheer.



“With that out of the way, let us drink to another decade of peace!” I laughed heartily and raised my glass.



Don Argento raised his and so did Don Rinaldi, whose hot stares I could feel at the back of my head.



I picked my fiance Becky and spun her in the air, she laughed heartily “We have a wedding to plan” I laughed, I took another glance at Ariana, her face full of fright as she visibly trembled.



“Thank you Ari for the lookout out” I said before going to hug her tightly, she smelled like sex, and her hair smelled of new shampoo, like she just took a bath.



The nape of her neck looked like it had a hand print on it, my mind immediately flashed to something, and before I was able to grab onto it, it flew just as fast as it came.



Damnit.



She pulled her terrified body that suddenly felt too familiar away from mine, “y…yes” she stuttered as brushing my hands gently away from her arms.



She had always felt herself too good for me, and her father never failed to remind me every day how he saved me.



The whole family disgusted me, so I will show them the fullest extent of how far I'm willing to go to prove that I own Italy now, killing my bastard half-brother was a start.



I gave her a small peck on her lips and withdrew to face her father, I smiled heartily ‘DON! Celebrations are in order! Congratulations once again,” I laughed before hugging him and immediately retreating, as much as I liked to pull enemies closer, Don Rinaldi is a poison I don't even want close to my tux.



“I'll be taking my leave now” I kept smiling as I gestured to my fiance Becky to follow, “please expect my invitation in a few days, I can't wait to marry this ravishing woman” I laughed as I grabbed Becky’s butt in front of everyone, she chucked and grabbed unto my neck and folded a leg up to my torso.



A month later I was wearing my wedding tux and looking rather ravishing if I must add, I dusted invisible dirt off my right shoulder and shot myself a striking pose in the mirror before I left the room, I walked down the hallway towards the main door of my villa to stand at the beautifully decorated podium, my Becky had chosen.



As I reached the main gate I remembered I had hidden my well-written vows from snoopy Becky in the kitchen, I gestured to my bodyguard to wait for me, and I walked briskly to the kitchen when I suddenly stopped in my steps, the guest room on the ground floor was opened slightly and I heard chatters, I moved closer.



“You know that black girl he is marrying, I heard she’s a retired escort, they met in Miami when he went there to check on the containers personally” I heard a man say, I fumed with anger, “a whore! Amazing, he is just immature, and can never act like a true Don, he knows we don't marry our whores” the other man laughed, I knew those voices, they were people he did business with, I wanted them dead immediately, I pulled out my pistol and was about to burst in when I saw my beautiful bride run down the hallway to where I stood, I met her halfway.



“Baby! Everyone is waiting bunny!” Becky yelled, I quickly hid my gun grabbed her and raised her in the air, she looked so breathtaking I kissed her intensely.



“It's bad luck to see the bride before the main wedding” she laughed hitting me o my shoulder, “forget that anymore, I want to bend you over and fuck you right here in that gown,” I said as I grabbed her close to my hard cock.



“We have so much time for that, AFTER the wedding, come on” She kissed me and quickly pulled away, she grabbed my arm and pulled me to the door.



Moments later we were faced in front of my seated colleagues and family, as well as some of her friends from America, she was an orphan and she didn't have a family.



“Will you Becky take Mateo to be your……



Becky’s face changed, she held her abdomen before giving out a loud shriek, I watched as my fiance slumped to the ground!

She was nineteen — older, smarter, already in college — and honestly, way out of my league. She was tutoring at the community center part-time, helping kids with math. That’s technically why I was there. But after the first day, I realized I’d be “struggling” with algebra for a very long time. Not because I couldn’t do it, but because she made figuring out equations feel like the least important thing happening in that room. She had this confident, low-key energy — like she didn’t have to try to be interesting; she just was.

The first time she smiled at one of my dumb jokes, I was hooked. It wasn’t a full laugh — more like this half-smirk, like she knew exactly what I was doing but was choosing to entertain it anyway. I remember thinking, Okay, this girl is dangerous. But of course, that just made me want to see her more. I’d come in early, leave late. Ask questions I already knew the answers to, just so she’d lean over my notebook or raise an eyebrow and say something sarcastic. Our whole thing became this flirty back-and-forth — I’d push, she’d tease, and somewhere in the middle, we started talking about more than just math. Music, family, stuff we wanted to do with our lives. With her, I didn’t feel like some high school kid trying to impress a college girl — I felt like me, and that was enough.

One afternoon, I called her trouble, just to see how she’d react. She looked up from my notebook and said, “I’m not the one faking math problems just to flirt.” And I swear, my heart stopped. I laughed it off — played it cool — but inside, I was absolutely losing it. She got me. She challenged me. She didn’t treat me like I was just a kid — she treated me like someone worth her time. And yeah, there was a line between us, and she never let it blur too far. But it was always there, this spark, this charged silence between the jokes. I caught her looking at me sometimes. Not in a weird way, just like… like she saw something more. And every time I caught her, she’d just smirk and say something like, “Focus, genius.”

When she left for university, I tried not to be dramatic about it. I told her good luck, acted like it was no big deal — and then stared at my phone for days. Didn’t even have to wait long. First night, she texted: “So, who’s annoying you with their terrible algebra now?” I replied something smooth like, “No one’s as good at pretending not to like me as you were.” That set the tone. We texted constantly. She’d send me pics of her new city, her coffee orders, playlists that were “totally not about me.” I’d send her voice notes, memes, and way too many “accidental” compliments. She’d laugh it off, but I could tell she liked it.

Now it’s this… thing. We’re not together, exactly. But we talk every day. When she’s stressed, she calls me. When I ace a test or bomb one, she’s the first person I tell. Sometimes we flirt like it’s a game, and sometimes it gets quiet and real, like there’s more we’re not saying out loud. She still calls me kid just to mess with me — and I still pretend to be annoyed, even though it kind of makes me melt. And yeah, I get that the timing isn’t perfect. I’m still growing up. She’s figuring out her world. But somehow, through texts and late-night calls and stolen memories from a tutoring room, we found something real.

Maybe it’s not official. Maybe it never will be. But she changed something in me. Made me want to be better — sharper, more confident, more me. And even if nothing ever comes of it, I’ll always remember how it felt when a girl I never expected to meet looked at me like I was more than just a teenage boy with a crush — like I was someone worth her time.

And maybe — just maybe — she felt the same way. Part two is already being written thanks for the throwaway!",1,1751614320.0,teenrelationships,1,1.0,False

I didn’t fall deeply asleep, but I wasn’t fully awake either.In that space between dreaming and waking, a story began to unfold—one that seemed to have started before I even realized I was thinking about it.
I found myself being told about a distant place—somewhere near the border—where human trafficking was happening quietly and cruelly. There were areas strictly warned against, forbidden for anyone who didn’t want to become a commodity. One such place was a forest shaped like a teddy bear—soft and harmless in appearance, but hiding something terribly dangerous. I still remember the warning clearly:
“There is something precious in that place, but it is also a deadly trap.”
I woke for a brief moment, but sleep still clung to me. I laid back, arm over my forehead, eyes closed, body relaxed. This time, it wasn’t a deep dream, but a shallow one—where a sliver of awareness remained.
A strange voice echoed in my mind:
“The hunters seek those who trust too easily…”
Then the first scene appeared.
A young man got into a taxi, unaware that he had just stepped into a trap. The car drove off—not to where he expected to go.
The image faded. A new scene appeared, as if in a film transition.A young woman was searching for something in the teddy bear-shaped forest. I could only see her back. At that moment, I was merely an observer.
The third time, my perspective shifted.
I saw the girl from the front, crouching down to pick something up. A man silently approached from behind, carrying a large sack. Without a sound, he pulled the sack over the girl, ignoring her struggling, dragging her toward his accomplices.
But when the sack was opened and her face was revealed—he froze.His expression changed.Without a word, he dropped everything and ran—panic-stricken.
And then the perspective changed again.
I was no longer watching from the outside. I was him.
I ran. I looked back. Her head was slightly lowered, but her eyes—sharp, piercing—could kill me at any moment.
His sister.She was chasing me across time and space. I didn’t know what I had done.
All I knew was that I had to escape.
I stumbled upon a police car and threw myself in front of it, begging to get in.
The officer gave me a bottle of water and let me climb aboard.But the fear didn’t leave me.I knew she was coming.I knew she would kill me.
The days that followed, I lived like prey.Always watching over my shoulder. Holding my breath at every corner.I escaped her a few times.But then came the day I couldn’t anymore. At a coffee shop, as I stepped past a large pillar, I saw her. His sister. She was sitting there—with the very officer who had once saved me. I couldn’t stop anything. I only saw blood.And that same gaze—the one from that night.I ran.I fled to a nearby house.Didn’t close the gate in time.
I knew she had found me.I ran around the side of the house, climbed over the fence.
Didn’t stop.
Couldn’t stop.
I jumped into a garden—grass as tall as my waist.I dropped down, holding my breath, burying myself in the thick weeds.I needed time.I needed air.
Then the scene shifted again.I saw his sister again.She was near the back fence now.Still those eyes.Still that murderous aura.She didn’t rush.She was hunting—like a cat playing with its prey.
And just then, my thoughts snapped back to reality.I realized I was awake—but my heart was pounding like a drum.Though it was all in my head, everything had felt terrifyingly real.
I didn’t just dream it—I lived inside that dream, like it was carved into my very being.

This is probably gonna sound stupid but I'm 19M and my mom has been opening my mail for years. Not just packages but like everything. Bank statements, letters from school, medical stuff, you name it.

When I confronted her about it she got all defensive and said ""I'm your mother I have a right to know what's going on in your life."" But like... no? That's literally a federal crime isn't it?

The worst part is she'll read my stuff then bring it up in random conversations like she's testing me. Last week she was like ""oh I saw your bank statement, you're spending too much on coffee"" and I'm like HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT.

I tried getting a PO Box but she found out somehow and threw this huge fit about how I'm ""hiding things from family"" and ""acting suspicious."" She even called my dad at work crying about how I don't trust her anymore.

Now she's threatening to stop paying for my car insurance if I don't ""stop being secretive."" But opening someone's mail is literally illegal right? I looked it up and it's a felony but she acts like I'm being dramatic when I bring it up.

I feel like I'm going crazy because she makes it sound so reasonable when she explains it. Like maybe I am being too sensitive? But it feels so wrong and violating.

I dream of my future wife every day. The home we’ll live in, the city we’ll settle in, the pets we’ll take care of, the mundane things like drinking coffee together at the kitchen table in the morning. I wasn’t sure about whether kids would be part of my vision, but I’ve decided I would love the privilege of having children one day. I love kids and hope to create a family of my own because I’ve grown up with a somewhat distant, quiet family that doesn’t “love out loud” if you get what I mean. 

I’ve been feeling pretty hopeless about the future lately because my close friend and former girlfriend (we broke up 2 years ago) keeps talking about her future husband. She’s not currently dating anyone but only ever says “husband” when she talks about a hypothetical future partner. I get it, statistically bisexual women are much more likely to date and end up with men simply just because there’s more men available to them. And of course social pressure and family expectations and all of that. It hurts, not because I want her back, but because it’s made me realize how much easier of a path to motherhood she has. She wants to be a mom and would truly be a fantastic parent, and why would she ever choose a wife? She’d have a difficult and costly route to fulfilling her dreams if she kept that door open. It’s the hard truth and it sucks. We’re both only 20 so this is all pretty far in the future for both of us, but it’s stressing me out and making me sad.

As the heavy door of Ashwood Mental Hospital creaked open, a pale, slender woman stepped out. She was Audrey Patel. She covered her aching stomach and dragged her feet to walk, while the murmurs behind her followed like shadows.

Someone whispered, ""Mr. Patel's such a saint. He still sticks with her after she went nuts and hurt others with a knife.""

Another person said bitterly, ""If my wife pulled a stunt like that, I'd kick her out the same day. She's a total disgrace to Mr. Patel.""

Someone else chimed in, ""If Ms. Patterson's father hadn't passed away, and she hadn't moved in with her uncle, she would've married Mr. Patel ages ago. Audrey would never have had the chance.""

Audrey squinted against the harsh light and gave a bitter little smile.

Everyone knew the story. She was an orphan girl from some no-name town who somehow married Clayton Patel, a big-shot lawyer with a spotless image. People all said she won the lottery.

But now, with a reputation for being violent and unstable, fired from her job and fresh out of a mental hospital, she looked even more out of place next to Clayton.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'They all think I don't deserve him. Funny thing is, the one who stuck me in that hellhole and slapped that label on me was my perfect husband himself.'

It was July. The sun blazed down, but Audrey felt chilly all over, especially her heart.

Ashwood had a glossy cover story—something about correcting troubled youth and improving their mental state. But what went on inside was a nightmare.

Audrey, a 23-year-old grown woman, had been locked in there for a month because her husband claimed she was a danger and needed to have her mind straightened out.

During the past month, she was punished, starved, locked in pitch-black isolation—until she cracked, until she agreed she was wrong and promised to change.

Now, standing outside, breathing free air again, she watched Clayton hang up a call. His handsome face twisted with irritation.

""Zoe's ran a bath for you. Let's go home and wash off the bad luck,"" Clayton said to Audrey.

Audrey dodged the hand he reached toward her shoulder.

Clayton was always well-groomed with tailored suits and expensive cologne. But today, he didn't smell like his usual scent. Instead, he reeked of something sickly sweet, like overripe fruit. That scent made Audrey sick.

Ignoring Clayton's grim face, Audrey pulled open the passenger-side door and got in.

The driver, who'd already opened the back door, glanced at Clayton in confusion.

Clayton watched her, his lips pressed tight. He thought she was clearly still sulking after a month of confinement. He figured she wasn't used to that kind of strict environment, so she threw a tantrum.

Though he had his reasons, he still went too far to send her in against her will. So, for now, he didn't blame her for her little temper.

He sat in the back seat. The driver closed the door and started the car.

Audrey turned to the window and closed her eyes. The whole thing a month ago appeared in her mind.

It was her birthday that day. Clayton brought home a special guest—his childhood friend, Valerie Patterson, and her three-year-old daughter, Luna Patterson.

While Clayton went to get the cake, Valerie grabbed a fruit knife and pressed it to her wrist, threatening to hurt herself if Audrey didn't give Clayton back to her.

Tears streamed down Valerie's face as she said she and Clayton were meant to be, that she came back to fix what they once lost.

Audrey lunged to stop Valerie and tried to snatch the knife just as Clayton walked in.

Valerie stumbled into Clayton's arms, sobbing like she'd just survived a war. ""Audrey, please don't hurt Luna. Clayton and I haven't done anything. You're getting it all wrong.""

Audrey stood frozen with the knife still in hand, her mind blanking out.

Valerie, still clinging to Clayton, glanced up at Audrey with a smug glint in her eyes. ""Clayton only let us move into your house 'cause we had nowhere else to go.

""I swear I'll pay back every penny he lent to us. Just don't scare my baby, okay? She's got autism.""

Clayton wrapped his arms around Valerie and Luna and shot a cold stare at Audrey. ""Valerie's hands are for painting. How could you hurt her?""

Little Luna, who watched the whole thing, just curled up tighter in Clayton's arms, shaking like a leaf.

Audrey let out a dry laugh, more from rage than amusement.

She thought to herself, 'So that's her game. She used my birthday party to air out her affair with Clayton. Either I suck it up and pretend my husband's got no side piece, or I pack my bags and quit the game.'

Audrey turned to Clayton, her voice firm. ""Believe it or not, she cut herself.""

""No way,"" Clayton shot back without missing a beat.

He was convinced no one knew Valerie's talent with a paintbrush better than he did. She would rather die than damage her hands. No chance she'd hurt herself just to frame Audrey.

Audrey scoffed and pointed straight at Valerie. ""Then tell me, why did you let them live in the house I bought and even gave them money? You're keeping her and her kid on the side, and I'm supposed to just be cool with it?""

Clayton's colleagues and a couple of his friends were right behind him. Being embarrassed like that in front of everyone clearly rattled him.

""My hand... Clayton, it hurts,"" Valerie whimpered, holding out her bleeding wrist, swaying like she was about to faint.

Guilt flashed across Clayton's face, but it was gone in a blink, replaced by anger. He barked at his assistant, ""My wife has violent tendencies. Send her to Ashwood Mental Hospital.""

Thinking back on it, Audrey put on a cold smile, sneering, 'To protect that woman's reputation, my husband threw me into that filthy place.'

Clayton must've caught that mocking look on her face, because for once, he tried to explain himself, ""I sent you to Ashwood to keep things from getting worse. You scared Luna.

""She had a fever for days. They've had a hard time. You shouldn't trash Valerie like that.""

Audrey opened her eyes, her gaze turning icy. ""I picked the house. I pay the mortgage. They're living in it and spending money from MY husband. Yeah, clearly I screwed up. I should've been more generous, huh?""

Clayton took a deep breath and said, ""Vally doesn't blame you. She's already dropped the charges. It won't affect you.""

Audrey sneered, thinking, 'Won't affect me? Due to my so-called violent tendencies you pinned on me, I lost my job three days after staying at Ashwood.'

Clayton and Valerie went way back. Years ago, both Valerie and Clayton's fathers got sick. Valerie's father gave up his shot at treatment and donated his kidney to save Clayton's father.

After that, Valerie and her mother moved out of town to live with her uncle. The night she turned up again, she was on the run. She was beaten by her husband, so she took her daughter to leave.

Clayton just happened to be on a business trip in that exact city. He swooped in like a hero, took on Valerie's divorce case, and brought her and her daughter back to Ironhaven.

\*\*\*\*\*

The car slowly rolled into Hightower Homes. Audrey didn't wait for it to stop but opened the door, got out, and headed straight for the elevator without a glance back.

She took a long shower and changed into clean clothes.

When she came out, Zoe was carrying dishes from the kitchen. She said with a smile, ""Dinner's almost ready, ma'am. Mr. Patel picked all your favorites.""

Clayton was on the couch going through some documents. He looked up over the rim of his gold-rimmed glasses and said, ""Dry your hair first. I'll wait to eat with you.""

Anyone walking in might've thought he was the picture of a devoted husband, setting aside legal briefs to dine with his wife.

But Audrey knew this was just his usual trick: slap you across the face and then hand you a candy.

Clayton took off his glasses and walked to the dining table. Pulling out a chair, he said, ""It's a bit late today. I'll have Zoe buy your favorite fish tomorrow.""

Audrey sat down without a word and picked up her fork.

Clayton was good at keeping his emotions locked up and hardly ever spoke more than necessary. Most of the time when they were together, Audrey always babbled him with some online gossip just to fill the silence.

Each time, Audrey would laugh out loud, yet Clayton was just calm and would sometimes give her a look to remind her of being composed.

Now, Audrey didn't even look at him. Worse, when he tried to serve her some food, she just picked it up and tossed it back onto the plate.

# Chapter 2 Don't Keep Pushing

Clayton tried to serve her more food, but Audrey stood up, dumped her utensils in the sink, and walked straight to the bedroom.

They had a nanny at home, but Audrey liked doing things herself. She used to cook Clayton's favorite meals and laid out his suits for the day. Zoe came in for an hour daily just to tidy up.

She used to think it was a sweet little routine between them, yet now, recalling what happened, Audrey felt like she was out of her mind in the past.

Clayton's mother, Lillian Patel, always thought Audrey was after Clayton's money. She made Clayton hand over half his paycheck every month for her to keep and said she'd return it when she was sure Audrey wasn't a gold digger.

Their finances had basically been split fifty-fifty since the wedding. And outsiders still loved gossiping about how Audrey married up, about her being some clingy, fame-hungry wannabe.

Audrey put up with all of it because she loved Clayton. But now? Now she couldn't believe how blind she used to be.

The husband she always felt proud of, the man who once stood for justice, fighting tooth and nail for unpaid factory workers, now threw his own wife under the bus to protect another woman's reputation.

Clayton's hand froze in the air, and he clearly felt the weight of her cold shoulder. He wiped his mouth with a napkin and knocked gently on the bedroom door. ""Audrey, I can explain that thing.""

From inside, Audrey let out a bitter laugh and thought, 'If you had anything to say, why didn't you say it a month ago in front of your coworkers, your friends, and in front of her? What's the act for now?'

She remembered that look in his eyes that night was nothing but irritation, and he said to her, ""You can leave Ashwood once you calm down.""

He even said, ""Vally and Luna have had it rough. If you're gonna make things worse for them, then maybe it's time you felt what being truly alone is like.""

He knew she was an orphan, and he always knew he was her only lifeline. But instead of standing by her, he sided with Valerie and crushed what little hope she had left.

When Valerie watched Audrey being dragged into Ashwood, she didn't even try to hide the satisfaction in her eyes. She smiled, as if saying, 'Say what you want, Clayton won't believe you. The more you fight it, the crazier you'll look.'

Audrey tried to break free from the nurses and scrambled back toward the hallway. With just one door between them, she heard Valerie sweet-talking Clayton, ""Clay, the doctor just said I can't draw anymore, but I can still have other jobs. Audrey only hurt me 'cause she loves you too much.""

Audrey didn't hear what Clayton replied because she was already forced into a room with bars on the windows.

She'd clenched her teeth and thought, 'If Clayton wants to play savior, he better chain himself to her for life. Just don't drag decent people down with them. I'm not interested in his lame excuse.'

Clearly thrown by Audrey's sudden silence, Clayton loosened his tie, feeling irritated without knowing why. He raised his voice to say, ""Why do you hate Vally so much? She's just a friend.""

Audrey didn't buy that for a second. She couldn't believe he still pretended not to know how Valerie felt for him.

After all, Valerie was jobless, divorced, and took her three-year-old daughter with autism back to Ironhaven and stepped into their life.

Audrey sneered inwardly, 'What kind of friend pushes others to divorce? What kind of friend throws herself into the arms of another woman's husband?'

If things kept going like this, Audrey knew she'd finally go crazy one day.

She suddenly flung the bedroom door open and sneered, ""Your family owes Valerie. That's your business, not mine. You want me to take care of your parents, but now I'm supposed to repay your debt too?""

She thought bitterly, 'Just because I married a superior and famous lawyer, I should play the good wife role? I didn't get any benefit from this marriage but got hurt mentally and physically.'

She looked him straight in the eye and said firmly, ""You were scared people would talk trash about her, so you told them I was violent and unstable. Her father saved your father, so you wanna sacrifice my reputation to protect her name?""

Her voice shook with rage. ""What right does she have to live in the house I bought and spend the money my husband gives her? What right do you have to send me to that darned mental hospital?""

Audrey had been holding her rage all in for too long, and now the dam burst. She let all her rage and her heartbreak out.

She hated Valerie for twisting the truth, but even more than that, she hated the man who once promised her a warm and safe home. She took a shaky breath, wiped her face, and realized her cheeks were wet with tears.

Clayton's expression turned more serious. He hadn't expected her to be this furious. Lowering his voice, he said, ""I know you lost your job, but I'll support you. Once Vally and Luna settle down, I'll hand over the rest of my paycheck to you.""

Audrey let out a long breath, feeling tired. She thought to herself, 'If I fall for his crap again, I'm the dumbest woman ever. You betrayed me once, and what makes you think I'll believe your promise again?'

She'd seen through him completely. Clayton's heart had already gone rotten. He'd always side with Valerie. This time, she was sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital. But she didn't know if she had a fight with Valerie again, what her heartless husband would do to her.

After all, she had no family. Clayton, as her legal guardian, had the power to do whatever he wanted.

Audrey looked at Clayton. Her eyes contained no more softness, no love, just a sheet of coldness.

She said, ""Don't bother dangling carrots in front of me. I got fired due to Valerie. You're gonna pay me 150,000 dollars. Then we get a divorce. You can play house with whoever you want after that.""

""I'm not divorcing you,"" Clayton shot back without hesitation.

Yanking off his tie, he flung it onto the couch. His chest felt tight, like he couldn't breathe. He thought, 'She wants a divorce over something so small? What the hell is wrong with her?'

The tie hit a decorative piece on the coffee table, knocking it to the floor. It shattered with a sharp crash, broken into pieces.

For once, the always-composed lawyer Clayton raised his voice. ""You lost your job, and I'll make it right. But divorce? Out of the question.""

He thought he'd already lowered himself enough. He was Clayton—the admired, respected, and untouchable top-tier lawyer. Now that he was trying to meet her halfway, Audrey should've known when to quit.

But Audrey's eyes were colder than ever. There was even disgust in them.

Clayton suddenly felt something slipping out of his grasp. He couldn't name it, but the feeling irritated him more than he cared to admit.

He muttered, ""It's all in the past. Can't we let it go?""

""Clay? Is Audrey back?"" Valerie's voice rang out as she walked in, decked out in a Chanel dress, a Coach bag on her arm, and a pair of shining high heels.

Valerie was five years older than Audrey, but she dressed younger and more fashionably. Audrey had always been practical—saving every cent to pay off the mortgage early, never splurging on luxury brands.

However, Valerie, a jobless single mother with a sick toddler, strolled in head-to-toe brands. It didn't take a genius to figure out who was footing the bill.

She stopped at the entryway, pretending to be shocked at the pieces on the floor. ""Audrey, if you've got a problem, take it out on me. My hand's ruined already. Go ahead and slash me again if it makes you feel better.

""That piece is a foreign art exhibit, you know? Clayton really likes it. It cost a few grand.""

Audrey let out a laugh that was anything but amused. ""Valerie, with that kind of imagination, you seriously missed your calling. You should be stalking celebs for gossip sites. I bought that piece, okay? How this involves you?""

Before Valerie could get a word in, Audrey turned to Clayton. ""You heard her, right? That thing's a foreign exhibit, cost 6,000 dollars. You broke it. You gotta pay.""

Valerie's eyes filled with tears instantly. She turned those helpless, wounded eyes toward Clayton. ""Clay, I thought you guys were arguing about me, so I—""

Clayton clenched his fists, feeling fed up. ""Vally's already forgiven you for what you did to her. You don't need to keep pushing.""

# Chapter 3 Clear The Mess

Valerie gently touched Clayton's arm and said, ""Clay, it's fine. I know Audrey hates me. I'll just leave now.""

But she didn't move a muscle. Instead, she looked up at Clayton with wide eyes, full of dependence and reluctance.

Clayton picked up the broken pieces and placed them on the coffee table. He was afraid Audrey might lose it again and end up hurting Valerie.

Clayton and Audrey got married just after they met each other. Back then, he was pissed at his family and randomly asked Audrey, who'd just dropped off a file at his law firm, if she'd marry him.

Audrey's reaction was unforgettable. She was first shocked, then pure joy. She told him she was an orphan, just landed a job at a foreign company, and didn't have much to offer compared to him. She promised she'd work hard, catch up to him, and be worthy.

Clayton made sure to sign a prenup, and the two of them got their marriage license without much fuss.

In the year since, Audrey worked her ass off at the office and at home. She arranged everything well, made his favorite meals, and never once complained.

Clayton could see how much she loved him in her eyes. He enjoyed being the center of her world. He believed she'd never actually leave him, and everything she said was just because she was angry.

Clayton said to Valerie, ""Vally, can you go back for now?""

""Huh?"" Valerie looked like she'd just been slapped.

Her eyes went wide in disbelief, and she thought, 'Is Clayton seriously kicking me out for Audrey?'

""I need to talk to Audrey. I'll come see you later,"" he added, looking at her with a gentler gaze, like trying to soothe a sulking child.

""Alright, I'll wait for you,"" Valerie said, but her heels didn't budge.

She turned to Audrey with a smile that barely masked her bitterness. ""Audrey, Clayton and I have known each other since we were kids. If anything were going to happen between us, it would've happened a long time ago. Don't you think?""

Just then, Zoe burst through the door, breathless. ""Ms. Patterson, come here, Luna collapsed. Her face is blue. I didn't dare move her.""

Valerie let out a sharp gasp and spun toward Clayton. ""What should I do? She had an episode yesterday too. Clayton, I'm scared.""

Clayton didn't hesitate. He turned around and went toward the living room. ""Calm down. Let's take her to the hospital right away.""

""Thank goodness you're here,"" Valerie said, sticking close to him. ""Feel my hands. I'm freezing.""

As Clayton grabbed his car keys, he suddenly thought of Audrey. His hand paused mid-air.

He turned back and looked at her, saying. ""Vally is still new to Ironhaven. She doesn't know the hospitals here. I'll take Luna to see the doctor first. Can we talk later?""

Audrey stared back at him, her face blank. She didn't give him any response.

Clayton frowned, and Valerie instantly took his arm and said, ""What if something happens to Luna? If she dies, I won't want to live.""

Without another word, Clayton grabbed the keys and rushed out the door.

Valerie followed right behind him, but before stepping outside, she turned around and shot Audrey a smug little look—one that screamed, 'See? You lost again, Audrey. I'm the one Clayton cares about above all.'

Audrey stood by the window and watched as Clayton carried Luna to the car, and Valerie slipped into the passenger seat. To any outsider, they'd look like a perfect family.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'How ridiculous. Her own kid passed out. Instead of checking on her, that woman ran straight to Clayton.

'What if he weren't here? Would she watch her daughter die? Either Clayton's too blind to see through this pathetic act or he enjoys playing her hero.'

Zoe then left too, and the house finally went quiet. Audrey went back to the bedroom and started packing her things. She wasn't going to keep tolerating this broken marriage—not for another day.

Clayton was a lawyer. If he refused to divorce, she'd have to sue him, and she knew she'd be at a disadvantage. But she wasn't scared. It was hard, but it didn't mean it was impossible.

Back when they got married on impulse, Clayton suggested they take a year to get to know each other before becoming a ""real"" couple. Audrey agreed, but on one condition—she'd buy her own house with her own money.

Now, she felt relieved that she made that decision. At least she still left herself a way out.

Audrey took out her suitcase and started packing her clothes and documents. Then, she opened her jewelry box on the vanity. Inside was the diamond necklace Clayton bought her. The diamond wasn't huge, but it cost over ten grand.

She'd barely worn it, afraid it looked too flashy. Now, all she could think was how stupid she'd been.

She never asked Clayton to stop giving money to his parents. During holidays, she always paid out of her own pocket to buy his parents some gifts to avoid conflict.

She didn't spend a dime of Clayton's money, yet Valerie and her kid were living off Clayton just fine.

Audrey took a deep breath, opened a drawer, and grabbed the incident report and withdrawal form from Ashwood Mental Hospital, along with the clean bill of health the doctor gave her when she was discharged.

Then she hailed a cab and went straight to the apartment she bought herself—only to find the lock code had been changed.

Furious, she called the police. The police showed up with the building's property manager in tow.

The manager looked nervous as hell and explained, ""Mrs. Patel, Mr. Patel told us that woman and her daughter would move in.""

Audrey held up her property deed and declared, ""I'm the legal owner here. No one can move in without my permission. That's trespassing. Officer, I want the door opened under your supervision. If they damaged my place, I'm holding them and this property company accountable.""

The manager wiped the sweat from his forehead and called in a locksmith. When the door swung open, even the police and the manager looked stunned.

The house was originally done in minimalist style—white walls, light tiles, nothing fancy. Audrey didn't have enough budget to renovate it, but it was clean and livable.

Audrey once ordered all the furniture online. Clayton told her the dimensions were wrong and the stuff had to be returned. Thus, they didn't move in yet.

But now, they really couldn't move in.

The floor was covered with takeout boxes, trash bags, soggy delivery containers, and so on. The once-pristine walls were scribbled with markers in every color. There were dark stains everywhere—god knows what caused them.

In the bedroom, bras and stockings were tossed all over the place. The air reeked of some cheap fruity perfume.

The plants Audrey had bought to clear out the formaldehyde were crammed onto the balcony, dried up like museum specimens.

With the police and building manager present, Audrey snapped photos of everything for evidence. Then she called a moving company. In front of everyone, she packed up all the junk, sealed it in boxes, and had it shipped off to Clayton's place in Hightower Homes.

When that was done, she asked the police for a formal incident report, changed the lock, and headed to her office to deal with her resignation procedure.

\*\*\*\*\*

At Ironhaven Medical Center, Clayton's good friend Carson Wilson pulled some strings to get Luna checked out fast.

After the exam, the doctor said, ""She had an allergic reaction that led to temporary airway obstruction. You'll need to figure out what triggered it. She got here in time, so she's currently fine. Still, don't take it lightly.""

""Thank you, doctor."" Valerie's eyes were full of tears. She clung to Clayton and said, ""Clay, I don't know what I would've done without you.""

But she noticed Clayton seemed distracted. Normally, the moment Valerie started crying, Clayton would be right there comforting her. Yet just now, when she tried to lean on him, he actually dodged a bit.

Valerie's heart dropped, and she thought, 'No. I can't let him slip away. Clayton is mine. I have to keep him mine.'

Through tears, she said, ""This is all my fault. I shouldn't have left Luna outside like that. But you know what Audrey did last time.

""Luna already has autism, and she's still scared from that scene. I didn't have a choice but to leave her in the living room.""

# Chapter 4 Audrey's Fight Back

""You know Luna is my whole world,"" Valerie sobbed, covering her face with both hands. ""Back then, I took beatings just to protect her. If anything happens to her now because of my carelessness, I won't forgive myself.""

Hearing her cry, Clayton felt a sudden wave of irritation rising in his chest.

He said, ""The doctor said she's fine. Don't beat yourself up. Honestly, getting her out of that mess is already brave. I've got stuff to deal with. You stay here and look after Luna, okay?""

A bad feeling crept up Valerie's spine. She asked cautiously, ""Are you worried Audrey will be mad? I can take Luna and leave. I swear we won't cause you any trouble.""

""You don't have to leave,"" Clayton replied, rubbing his temples. ""It's something at the firm.""

The real reason Clayton had Audrey sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital on her birthday was because she cut Valerie's hand. Valerie's reputation was just a minor cause.

He thought getting Audrey out of the picture would calm Valerie down, and then maybe she'd agree to drop the charges. If Audrey ended up with a record, she'd be blacklisted from half the job market.

Clayton had connections at Ashwood—his law firm handled some of their legal affairs. He personally asked the manager to put Audrey in a quiet, nicer section of the hospital and told him she just needed time to cool off.

""Audrey is not the kind to hold grudges,"" Clayton added absentmindedly.

Valerie almost lost control of her expression. She opened her mouth to say more, but Clayton had already turned around and left the ward.

Carson, waiting outside the ward, walked down the stairs with Clayton. Carson said, ""Look, man, don't take this the wrong way, but Valerie's got a strange look in her eyes when she sees you.""

Clayton shot Carson a look that could freeze hell. He warned, ""Say that again, and you're not my friend anymore.""

""Alright, alright."" Carson raised his hands in surrender. ""I'm done. Just keep your eyes open. Audrey's not your match, but she's been really good to you.""

Clayton's eyes flickered, then he turned around and left the hospital. Carson stood there watching him leave and shaking his head.

None of the guys in their circles planned to get married, and they definitely hadn't supported Clayton's impulsive marriage just to spite his family for arranging an alliance for him.

But Audrey's devotion after they got married made a few of them reconsider the whole bachelor lifestyle.

When Clayton brought Valerie back into the picture and started putting her first in everything, Carson warned him not to keep Audrey in the dark.

On Audrey's birthday, Clayton had planned to finally come clean. But they were a bit late, and the accident happened.

Once Valerie was sure the two men had left, the soft worry and guilt drained from her face in an instant. Her whole expression turned cold as she looked at Luna lying on the bed.

She muttered, ""Useless. Couldn't you have eaten a few more chestnuts? You are in no danger. Clay didn't even care to stay.""

Luna's small frame shrank into itself. Her head was too big for her frail body. She stared at her mother, her eyes wide with fear and confusion.

Just minutes after Clayton walked out, Audrey stepped into the hospital.

Carson spotted Audrey and assumed she was there to give Valerie a hard time. He was about to call Clayton when he overheard two nurses whispering nearby.

The first nurse said, ""Oh my, no one can stop them? Beating people is illegal.""

Another nurse replied, ""A 10-year-old or so boy died there last year. His folks spent six months in court. In the end, they called it an accident and got a little compensation.""

Carson walked over and said behind them, ""You two work here or just gossip for a living?""

The nurses giggled upon seeing Carson. He was kind of a big deal around here, returning from abroad with a flashy resume.

The first nurse explained, ""We were talking about Ashwood Mental Hospital, Dr. Wilson. That place is hell. I don't get why some parents send their kids there just to get them beat up.""

The other nurse added, ""The owners have people backing them. If someone gets hurt or even dies, they just throw money at it. That woman had bruises all over. Hope she gets some justice.""

Carson's brows furrowed upon hearing that. He knew Clayton had sent Audrey to Ashwood.

Lots of kids had behavioral issues, tech addictions, and attitude problems. It was said Ashwood could straighten them out.

Carson didn't think giving troubled teens a little tough love was a big deal. As far as he was concerned, a place like Ashwood Mental Hospital had its uses. Plus, Clayton knew the manager there, and Audrey was an adult, so surely they'd treat her differently.

""You can't write off a whole institution just because of a few bad stories. If it exists, there's a reason,"" Carson said before heading back to his office.

That conversation made him forget all about calling Clayton.

Meanwhile, Audrey sat in a park, holding her injury report. The staff at Ashwood didn't dare beat her outright, but they played all kinds of mental games and messed with her food.

When she caught wind of her release, she used a bathroom break to rough herself up a bit. The bruises looked terrifying but weren't actually deep.

She waited until nearly 4 p.m. before spotting a familiar figure rushing by. Audrey stood up and called out, ""Mr. Sanchez.""

Leo Sanchez, Ashwood's manager, was in his forties with a beer belly. He strode like he had something urgent to do. He glanced at Audrey and instantly looked annoyed.

""Audrey? What do you want?"" he snapped, not even bothering to call her ""Mrs. Patel"".

Audrey crooked her finger at him, signaling for him to sit on the bench.

Leo's face turned grim. He snapped, ""If you've got something to say, spit it out. I'm busy.""

""Are you rushing to Little Dreamers Preschool to pick up your lovechild?"" Audrey raised her voice.

Leo's face turned an ugly shade of red. His eyes were filled with panic and fury.

No one was supposed to know about the kid he had with his mistress, but he didn't know how Audrey found out.

The park was full of parents with their kids. If anyone heard that, word would spread fast, and he couldn't risk that kind of heat falling on his son.

Grinding his teeth, Leo walked over and sat stiffly on the bench. ""Now, talk.""

Audrey waved the medical report and tossed it onto his lap. ""While I was locked up at Ashwood, I was abused—physically and emotionally—by your staff. I want compensation for medical bills, nutrition recovery, and psychological damage.""

Leo's eyes nearly popped out at the number—150,000 dollars. He growled, ""This is extortion.""

Audrey let out a cold chuckle. ""Call it what you want. If you think I'm bluffing, I'll go straight to the cops or the press. You pick.""

A smirk flickered in Leo's eyes. He knew Clayton's law firm represented Ashwood. Clayton had personally called to make sure Audrey ""learned her lesson"". He was sure that Clayton would help her with the lawsuit.

""Does Mr. Patel know what you're up to?"" Leo asked.

Audrey thought, 'Trying to use Clayton against me? I used to care about his feelings, but now, I'd skin him alive if I could.'

She folded her arms with a sneer. ""Did Clayton also tell you I've got violent tendencies? Kinda like being legally insane."" Her voice dropped lower. ""So tell me, what would happen if I lost my mind and stabbed your son? Who would the law blame then?""

Leo's face drained of color. Audrey's file did say she had a history of extreme behavior. His staff also reported she was stubborn as hell. When they locked her in solitary, she still refused to admit anything.

Leo thought bitterly, 'This woman is really insane. Ashwood only exists because my father-in-law pulled strings. If they find out I've got a mistress and a secret kid, I'm toast.

'Valerie's about to become Mrs. Patel, anyway. Once the divorce goes through and Audrey's out of the picture, I'll stash my kid somewhere and deal with her then.'

This means troons who need help such as affording a few months of HRT, can apply and receive support from troons who can provide it.

It would go like this:

**Requesting Help**

You fill out a form that provides your

• Reddit user handle (I need to see some history of trans posting which means you are unlikely to be a cissoid with potentially bad intentions) 

• Reason for request, e.g. “I need to afford one year of HRT before I can graduate university and get a full time job”

• Request amount 

• Method and link to where you can receive support/funds (e.g. Crypto, Buy Me a Coffee, Kofi, Venmo) **edit: Crypto would be the best**

**Verified recipients**

• If you are verified as a recipient, I will add your reason for request, your request amount, and your payment link to a view-only spreadsheet 

**Providing Help**

• Use recipient’s payment link to transfer funds 

• For crypto, I will include an additional link so you can check if the request of the recipient was already fulfilled

• For non-crypto, if you want to provide help, those non-crypto requests will be on a separate sheet. If you transferred funds, DM me with the transaction ID and amount transferred, and I will input those details into that sheet, so that others can see if the request was already fulfilled. 

**FAQ**

Why is this so complicated, can’t you just collect the money and disburse it?

The money cannot flow through my hands because laws and regulations 

Is this donations and is this charity?

Hi, I’d like to share my story about sharing a flat with others.
I’ve been living abroad for 6 years now. For the last four years, I’ve been dealing with trauma – or rather, post-trauma. Thankfully, I’ve come out of it now.
But the last three years of my life were a nightmare I could never have imagined.

Let me be clear – I could sleep, nobody stole food from the fridge, and there wasn’t constant noise.
But still, my life after 2021 turned into hell.
It all started with a simple move...

I only wanted a flat closer to work. But I ended up living with people who – no joke – pretended to be friendly, but something felt off from day one.
There were 11 Airwick diffusers in the house. Eleven. The whole place was filled with chemical mist. I felt like I was living in a gas chamber.

I worked long shifts and came home late. My routine became this secret mission:
I had to wash my face and brush my teeth in the changingroom, eat a little porridge in secret before leaving, then come home, hold my breath, rush to my room, seal the door with tape and a towel, open the window, and try to sleep.
I did this for two years straight.

I tried everything: talking to them, reporting it to the landlord, even unplugging the diffusers manually.
Nothing worked.

Sometimes they toned it down for a week or two. But soon it was back to MAXIMUM intensity.
I had to give up the gym. Just being outside for two hours and coming home meant I couldn’t even sit on the sofa or drink my protein shake because I was choking on fake flower-scented death.

That woman clearly had major insecurities.
She was always on a diet, overweight, and possibly couldn’t stand seeing anyone cook healthy meals. So she turned the house into a giant scented battlefield – like a pet store on steroids. Diffusers in every socket. Everywhere.

These “insect flower” sprays? They contain ingredients that i read about are linked to infertility. I felt it physically — my throat, lungs, chest were burning.

Even basic tasks like eating breakfast or coming home from work felt like CIA undercover operations.
And then came COVID madness…

In 2022, during the Omicron wave, they told me to wear a mask at home and not eat breakfast because I had a fever.
I wasn’t allowed to leave my room.
I’m the kind of person who’s had anger issues in the past, but I wanted to keep calm. I was 30. I waited it out. After two years… they finally moved out.
But it got worse.

A new flatmate moved in — a lady: loud alcoholic and drug user. Another guy, who had always been suspiciously quiet, started hanging out with her.
He basically lived in his car, using it as a fridge. Rarely used the kitchen. But now, they became friends.

They spied on me constantly. If I tried to use the toilet in the morning, she’d knock like crazy, yelling that I was in ""her"" bathroom time.
I couldn’t even poop for 5 minutes in peace. And yet she had time to make coffee and smoke, leaving the door open so her smoke filled the house.
I was the only one cleaning. There was a list on the fridge that you had to sign in at what time you came home, but I was the only one who CLEAN the House!!!
Wtf? To have a schedule for coming home?
They would drink beer and whisper about me on my days off when I just wanted to cook or bake some bread.
They complained about me taking showers at the “wrong time” – like on a Sunday morning after a run or workout.
I thought that guy was on my side, but the moment she moved in, he turned on me.

This was my daily life. A war with air fresheners.
A war with people who had no sense of boundaries, empathy, or basic decency.

One time, I got WhatsApp messages telling me not to leave my room before 8 AM.
That I shouldn’t poop if it bothers someone. That I should change my diet if I “have to take a shit in the morning.”

Another message said I shouldn’t make breakfast, because “the girl doesn’t want to look at me.”
He even told me something like, “You’re obsessed with smells, man. At 30, people should be doing school, reading, developing. Not worrying about scent.”

I wanted to scream.
Who tells someone not to poop in a house they’re paying rent in? Who acts like a Neanderthal and then lectures about homo sapiens and personal growth? I showed these screenshots to the landlord and explained why I'm leaving. And I wasn’t alone. Another normal woman left the house a month before me  as she had enough of a whole situation too.

I just wanted to live like a normal European — make breakfast, go for a run, open a window, cook a meal, take a shower.
Now I live with people from Bangladesh and India.
No Airwick. No smoking. No alcohol. No addicts. No suspicious silent types.
I’m finally saving money and breathing clean air.
I know other people have bigger problems. But this was my personal hell.
And when I finally have my own place, I dream of something simple:

A sofa. My own plants. Essential oils. A window I can open. A kitchen I can use. A peaceful shower. Bread in the oven.

Life abroad isn’t easy. You often end up surrounded by people from the margins of society.

But I survived. I’ve talked to therapists. And now I want to share my story — maybe to laugh, maybe to warn.
But mostly to remind myself: that was real. I got through it.

It’s like I can't fully wake up without it, and I’ve been wondering if it’s just habit or something deeper. 🙃 My routine is pretty set: I grind the beans, enjoy the smell (seriously, I live for that), brew the coffee, and then sip it while watching the sunrise from my tiny kitchen window.

I've been following this habit for a while now, and I have to admit, it kinda centers me. It's almost like a mini-meditation session before diving into my day. I think it sets a rhythm that helps me tackle whatever the day throws at me with more focus. Maybe it's the caffeine, but part of me wonders if it’s more about having that consistent ritual that’s comforting.

I read somewhere that routines can reduce decision fatigue, and I guess having that one thing I can count on in the morning eases my mind. 🤔 I notice I’m way less stressed at work when I stick to my morning coffee ritual. There's gotta be some psychology behind turning mundane tasks into something that creates such positive vibes. Or maybe... just maybe, I'm way too into my coffee. 😅 Anyone else find that these little habits give you a sense of control?",9,1751612614.0,unpackinghabits,0,1.0,False

1lrcb01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1lrcb01/the_discipline_system_that_finally_worked_for_me/,The discipline system that finally worked for me - DO NOT rely on motivation anymore,"I used to wake up scrolling Instagram, skip workouts, binge YouTube until 2AM, and beat myself up for having “no discipline.” I bought habit trackers, downloaded a dozen productivity apps, even tried writing letters to “my future self.” Nothing stuck. I was chasing motivation like it was a drug - and it always wore off.

If you’ve ever set goals and watched them crumble by Tuesday, you’re not alone. I want to share what finally worked for me - not some Pinterest aesthetic routine, but a gritty, real-world mindset shift that actually changed my life.

It started with one brutal realization: I wasn’t lazy. I was addicted to dopamine spikes.
Doomscrolling, TikTok loops, DoorDash meals - they were all giving me tiny hits of satisfaction that trained my brain to avoid effort and delay. But the thing that saved me? Daily reading and a discipline-first mindset - even when I didn’t feel like it. Especially when I didn’t feel like it.

Once I stopped chasing “motivation” and treated discipline like brushing my teeth - non-negotiable - I got scary productive. Not perfect. Just consistent enough to transform how I work, think, feel, and show up in life.

Here are some brutal but powerful truths that helped me build real discipline:

Motivation is dopamine. Discipline is identity. Build habits that reflect who you want to become, not just what you want to achieve.
Track streaks, not perfection. Missing once is okay. Twice becomes a new habit.

Temptation bundling works. I pair tasks I avoid (reading academic papers) with things I love (coffee shop vibes or lo-fi beats).
Make it frictionless. Put your gym clothes next to your bed. Keep your Kindle on the kitchen counter.

If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now. This rule cured my procrastination.
Treat distractions like addictions. I log apps I use mindlessly and replace the habit loop.
Your brain resists change, not effort. Push through the discomfort - it means growth is happening.

My therapist once said, “You can’t think your way into new behavior. You behave your way into new thinking.” That quote literally rewired how I approach discipline.

Here are some resources that truly helped me shift from chaos to clarity - especially around building discipline without motivation:

Atomic Habits by James Clear: Bestselling book that’s everywhere for a reason. Clear (pun intended) framework to actually build habits that stick. This book made me realize success isn’t one huge transformation - it’s 1% changes, repeated daily. Probably the best habit book I’ve ever read. Life-changing.

Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins: A raw, intense look into mental toughness. Goggins went from obese to Navy SEAL and ultra-marathoner. It’s not for the faint-hearted, but if you want to feel lit up and unstoppable, this is it. I listened to the audiobook while running -it changed my pace and my mindset.

Deep Work by Cal Newport: This book made me delete 80% of the apps on my phone. Newport explains why shallow distractions kill your potential - and how to train your mind for focus again. A must-read if your attention span’s been fried.

The Tim Ferriss Show podcast: The GOAT of productivity interviews. Tim reverse-engineers the habits of top performers, and you’ll walk away with actual tools - not just fluff. His episodes on morning routines and decision-making completely reshaped mine. Great to listen to while commuting or meal prepping.

BeFreed: Kept seeing people recommend this smart learning/book summary app and finally gave it a shot - because honestly, I’m too busy to finish full books these days. You can pick how deep you want to go: 10-min quick summary, or 20-40+ min deep dive. You can choose the tone: formal or humorous and they even let you clone a loved one’s voice to read to you. I tested it with a few books I already knew, and ngl, 90% of the key insights were there. I’ve finished more books in the past 3 weeks than I did all last year. Total game-changer for rebuilding focus.

Forest: This one helps me stay off my phone by growing a virtual tree when I stay focused. Weirdly addicting and super effective. Gamifies discipline like Duolingo but for your attention span.

Matt D’Avella’s youtube channel: His minimalism and discipline videos feel like calm therapy + actionable tips. The one about ""How to Get Your Life Together in 30 Days"" legit kickstarted my whole reset. Perfect if you're starting from zero.

Discipline changed my brain. Reading rewired how I think. And learning to act without “feeling like it” gave me a superpower most people spend their lives waiting for.

We live in a world where it's easy to be average - scroll, consume, repeat. But if you build discipline when no one’s watching, it shows up everywhere - how you talk, walk, think, and even love. And trust me, that version of you? Worth every hard moment.

Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential in under 90 seconds! [Try the free tool now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**The Rise of the Airbnb Nomad**

Digital nomadism isn’t a trend. It’s a migration. Borders blur, time zones collapse, and the world becomes your backyard. The old nine-to-five? Fossilized. Airbnb is the passport. The platform that let you swap cubicles for coastlines, boardrooms for balcony views.

**Airbnb as the Enabler**

Airbnb didn’t invent wanderlust. But it did weaponize it. Suddenly, every city is a possibility. Every apartment, a temporary kingdom. You aren’t just visiting—you’re living. For a week, a month, or until the next whim strikes.

***🌏 Ready to unlock your nomadic income? Discover your earning power as a digital nomad in 90 seconds! [Take the quiz.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Why Airbnb? The Platform’s Magnetic Pull**

Flexibility is the new currency. Airbnb lets you dodge leases, skip deposits, and live by your own rules. No landlord breathing down your neck. No furniture to haul. Just a digital key and a new address every time wanderlust bites.

Global inventory means you can taste Tokyo, sip espresso in Lisbon, or chase the sun in Bali. Each stay is a new flavor. Local hosts, neighborhood secrets, the kind of immersion hotels can’t touch.

**The Anatomy of a Nomadic Setup**

Your life in a backpack. Every item, a calculated risk. Do you need that extra pair of shoes? Probably not. Adaptability is your superpower. Chargers, adapters, and noise-canceling headphones—your holy trinity.

Packing isn’t just about clothes. It’s about mindset. Expect the unexpected. Rain in Rio? Blackout in Berlin? You’re ready.

**The Economics of Airbnb Living**

Forget the myth: nomad life isn’t always cheaper. But it’s value-packed. Compare the cost of static rent to the dynamic dance of short-term stays. Sometimes you win. Sometimes you pay for the privilege of freedom.

Hidden fees lurk in the fine print. Cleaning charges, service fees, “tourist taxes.” Negotiation is an art. Message hosts, ask for deals, play the long game. Loyalty pays off.

**The Emotional Rollercoaster**

Every new city is a dopamine hit. The thrill of the unknown. The rush of possibility. But paradise has a dark side. Loneliness creeps in. Friendships are fleeting. You’re always the outsider, the observer.

Yet, in the cracks, connection blooms. A shared meal. A late-night conversation. Sometimes, that’s enough.

***🌟 Wondering if the nomad life is for you? Find out your digital nomad income profile in 90 seconds! [Check your potential.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Connectivity: The Lifeblood of the Nomad**

Wi-Fi roulette. One day, blazing speeds; the next, prehistoric lag. Productivity hangs by a thread. You learn to spot the telltale modem, the router’s blinking light.

Community isn’t just about people. It’s about finding your tribe in coworking spaces, coffee shops, or the Airbnb next door. Connection—digital and human—keeps you sane.

**Navigating Legal Labyrinths**

Visas are the nomad’s nemesis. Rules shift, borders close, and bureaucracy bites. You become a master of loopholes. Visa runs, border hops, and the eternal search for the next stamp.

Airbnb regulations are a moving target. Some cities welcome you. Others wage war on short-term rentals. Stay sharp. Stay legal.

**Safety Nets and Snares**

Strange lands, stranger dangers. Security isn’t just a locked door. It’s street smarts, backup plans, and a healthy dose of skepticism. Insurance isn’t optional—it’s survival.

When things go sideways, you need a Plan B. And C. Maybe even D.

**The Art of the Short-Term Lease**

Listings lie. Photos flatter. You learn to read between the lines. “Cozy” means cramped. “Vibrant neighborhood” means noisy. Trust your gut. Ask questions. Hosts who answer fast are gold.

Red flags: evasive answers, bad reviews, too-good-to-be-true prices. Green lights: transparency, flexibility, glowing testimonials.

You’re not just collecting keys—you’re collecting stories. Hosts who become friends. Fellow travelers who become collaborators. The Airbnb experience is a social experiment.

But beware the tourist trap. Seek out the local haunts, the secret spots. That’s where the magic happens.

**Work-Life Blur: The Nomad’s Dilemma**

Boundaries evaporate. Your bedroom becomes your boardroom. The line between work and play? Invisible. Rituals save you. Morning routines, digital detoxes, sacred hours for deep work.

Sanity is a moving target. You chase it anyway.

**Sustainability and the Nomad Footprint**

Every flight, every stay leaves a mark. Eco-conscious choices matter. Reusable gear, public transport, supporting local businesses. The ethics of impact—own it.

The world is your playground. Don’t trash it.

**Earning on the Move**

Remote gigs. Freelance hustles. Passive income streams. The digital nomad isn’t just escaping the office—they’re building empires on the fly.

Monetize your skills. Sell your knowledge. The world pays for value.

**Burnout and the Myth of Endless Freedom**

Freedom isn’t free. Burnout lurks in the shadows. The myth of the endless vacation is just that—a myth. Recognize the signs. Rest. Recharge. Repeat.

Dear OP,

 

You may have noticed that many of the new coffees we’re launching this year are priced higher than in the past, and our perennials will follow suit on July 7th. This isn’t a decision we’ve taken lightly—our mission has always been to make specialty coffee as accessible as possible. But 2025 is shaping up to be one of the most challenging years the global coffee industry has faced in recent memory.

 

2025 has been an exceptionally tough year for coffee producers around the world. Climate change is hitting farms hard—unexpected rains, prolonged droughts, and rising temperatures are all reducing yields. The result? A global surge in coffee prices.


Earlier this year, during India’s harvest season, global rates for even commodity-grade beans hit a record high of nearly USD 4.50 per lb of green coffee.

 

That might raise a fair question:

 

“But isn’t your coffee sourced only from India? Why should global prices affect us?”

 

Here's Why:

 

Coffee is one of the most internationally traded commodities in the world. Whether it’s grown in Brazil, Vietnam, or Chikmagalur, beans ultimately follow the best-paying market, and this raises prices across the board.


This year, the average price we paid for green coffee in India went up by 49% compared to last year. In some cases, it more than doubled. We’ve tried to absorb as much of this increase as possible, but to keep supporting the farms we buy from and the entire team that works hard to make the cup you brew taste great, we’ve had to raise our prices too.


There is a silver lining: more of the money from every pack you buy is now going back to the farmers. That extra income helps them cope with rising costs like labour and fertilizers, but more importantly, it gives them the room to invest in better farming practices, improve quality, and build resilience against climate disruptions. Just as one example, our farm partners at the South India Coffee Company are carrying out essential research into climate resilient coffees to ensure that everyone in the coffee chain has alternatives for the future.


We know price increases are never easy. But we hope knowing the story behind your cup makes it a little easier to understand. As always, we’re deeply grateful for your trust, and for being part of a community that values not just great coffee, but fairness and sustainability too.


Thank you for being with us and as always, if you have any queries or questions, please let us know.

 

Happy brewing,

4. My failure of a first cheesecake (on my birthday no less) but it still tasted decent and the texture was somehow alright? I needed a more detailed recipe for my first time. 

5. Lemon thyme ricotta pie. The crust whooped my ass and made me realize using rice for a weight is not a waste. Crust 0/10 filling 7/10, I love a good ricotta

6. A Dutch apple pie, kinda messed up the crumble here but finally got the pie dough to cooperate. Was very proud of myself with this one. 

7. Garlic Rosemary focaccia, one of my all time faves and the thing I make the most often. Make a small Biga for overnight then do stretch and folds for 2.5 hours and about another two hours dimpling it on the pan. I use all purpose flower as I like it a little less dense. 

8/9. First ever bagels, turned out way better then I though I could do but I gotta let em rise a little more next time. 

10/11. Artisan fake sourdough loaf? I haven’t done a starter yet but I’ve made 4 of these now and only one came out inedible!

12. Glazed yeast donuts. I don’t have a crumb shot but these came out almost perfect and I’ve never been so proud of my cooking lol. Not technically baking as they were fried but I had to include them. My coworkers were big fans as well as I forgot to halve the recipe. 

If you made it this far I appreciate you and I hope good things happen to you.

# Chapter 1

Chapter One

Willow

I REALLY HAVE no idea how this shit happens to me. Every single day I get up early and go for my run. Once I’m done, I take a shower and get ready for the day. However, something always seems to happen to make me late no matter where I’m going. Especially when it comes to work. I don’t think there’s a single day since I started working at Inked Up that I’ve been early or on time. No matter how hard I try, something always seems to get in the way of how I want my day to go.

Today it’s everything breaking down on me. I went to get my tea and ended up having to clean my kitchen which was flooding. Something in the sink broke and I had to turn the water off so it would stop pouring out all over the place. None of the pipes under the sink appear to be broken, but that doesn’t mean anything. There’s obviously something really wrong if the water started spewing all over the place and turning off the faucet didn’t make it stop.

After changing, redoing my hair and make-up, and getting my things around to head out, the door wouldn’t lock. I never leave my house unlocked because I don’t trust my brother, Jared. Jared is an asshole and will come in and rob me blind if he knew I left everything open and unlocked. Even when I’m here, I don’t leave the doors unlocked or open the windows. In the summer, I have an air conditioner and make sure it’s in a window Jared can’t reach unless he pulls out the busted up ladder from the garage. Anyway, it took me almost twenty minutes to get my front door locked and that’s after messing with the alarm so it wouldn’t go off.

So, my day is starting out to be the same as every other day I wake up—not good or easy. Racing to my car, I almost trip over the edge of the cracked sidewalk. I’ve told myself for almost a year now that I’m going to rip it all out and fix it with new cement, but I never do. I’d probably end up stuck in the drying cement and not be able to get out or something. I am no use when it comes to projects around the house. I try and usually end up making more of a mess than what was originally there. The only thing I can do right around my small house is make sure the flowers are planted and blooming as my mom used to do.

My mom taught me from a young age to work in the gardens she has surrounding the home I grew up in. They line the front sidewalk, are in front of the house, and there’s a small flower garden at the back of the house where a swing has sat my entire life. I used to spend countless hours out there with my mom as she planted seeds, watered flowers, or we just spent time together on the swing rocking back and forth as she told me all about gardening and showering the flowers with love.

She died when I was about eight years old. I was told by my father it was a car accident, but I don’t buy his version of the story. He thinks I was too young to remember he never let her drive for any reason. My mom had to walk everywhere she went. Including the store to buy a month’s worth of groceries at one time. She was only allowed to go once a month and my father would get milk and other staples we needed weekly when he was out doing whatever it is he used to do. So, I don’t believe she died in a car accident, but I can’t prove something actually happened to her. I think about this every single day and wish I could have gotten her away from my father and brother before she lost her life.

My father wasn’t a good man. He drank from the time he woke up until he finally passed out each night, couldn’t keep a job, treated everyone around him horribly, and wouldn’t let me do anything outside of the house. If I even mentioned a friend from school, they soon were ignoring me for some reason. My father told me on a daily basis what a weak, pathetic, useless, piece of shit I was. He might not have beaten me, but he didn’t stop my brother Jared from beating the hell out of me on a daily basis. When I was old enough, my father tried to demand I steal him things from stores, our neighbors, and others in Cedar Bay. Jared would always beat me when I refused. Honestly, I’m surprised child protection services weren’t called into my home on a regular basis because of all the bruises covering my body at all times.

Jared’s favorite thing to do was torment and torture me in a variety of new ways he thought up. I swear, he’d spend hours of his time just thinking up new ways to beat and hurt me. His best friend David helped him on a regular basis. Not only did they pick on me for being extremely clumsy, but they beat me, chased away anyone who talked to me for any reason, and tried to pimp me out to the boys in their class. I didn’t go a day without one of them hurting me to the point I’d be curled up in a ball to protect myself or crying in my room where no one could see.

The happiest day of my life was when my father went out and never returned. I haven’t reported him missing because I don’t want him to be found. If someone, one of the neighbors usually, questions where he’s been, I come up with some lame reason he hasn’t been around. Though, I don’t think anyone is really mad or upset he’s not been in Cedar Bay for a while now. It’s also the same day Jared and David disappeared. They moved out of the house I grew up in and I hardly see them around. Yeah, my father let David move in when he got kicked out of his own house for beating the shit out of his mom. That’s who my father chose to surround me with. He never gave a shit about me because I didn’t bow down to his demands and do the horrible things he wanted me to.

These are the thoughts I have as I finally make my way to work. Almost a half hour late at this point. I swear, I could literally wake up as the sun rises and not go for my daily run or anything and still not get there on time. Otter, the manager of Inked Up, has checked on me more than once to make sure I’m okay when I arrive late. He always asks why and never raises his voice when I explain what’s happened. He’s a good boss. At least I think so. Even when he’s yelling at someone or barking out orders, Otter’s a good boss. Anyone else would have fired my ass already for always being late and having to replace as much shit in the tattoo shop as he’s had to because of me.

When I say I’m clumsy, I don’t just mean I trip over air and am always having days like today. Anything that can possibly happen or go wrong, usually happens to me. I’ve dropped entire boxes of sterilized needles and had to throw them out because they hit the floor and went flying in the storeroom when I’ve been putting orders away. No one in the shop will use a needle, even if it’s still sealed in the packaging, once it’s hit the floor or anything else. It’s a good system we have and I really try not to mess it up, but things happen when I’m around.

Pulling in the back of Inked Up, I park my car away from the bikes and other cars already here. As I shut off my engine, my phone pings from my purse. It’s an old cell phone I’ve had for years and definitely needs to be replaced. I just don’t have the money to replace it. I dig around my bag until my hands wrap around the small phone and pull it out. Opening it up, yes it’s a flip phone, I see Otter has sent me a message.

Otter: Are you okay? Coming into work today?

Me: I just pulled in. I had a small issue at the house this morning and had to deal with it before anything else. Be inside in a second. I’m so sorry!

Putting my phone back in my bag, I pull the keys from the ignition and toss them inside the mess as well. Getting out of my beat-up car that used to belong to my mom before my father banned her from driving, I look down at the ground as the silence is disrupted by the squeaking hinges of the door. It barely shuts and I have to fight most days to get the engine to turn over. This car isn’t going to last me forever, but it’s a good car and I’ll drive it until I can’t any longer.

Rushing across the parking lot, I pull open the back door of Inked Up just as someone goes to open it from the inside. I go flying backward and almost land on my ass. If it weren’t for the hands grabbing my arms, I’d be in a crumpled mess on the ground right now. Looking up, I find Trenton towering over me. He’s a member of the Wild Kings MC, but I can’t think of calling him by his road name. He’ll always be Trenton to me. Trenton and I grew up in Cedar Bay. I’ve known him my entire life. I’ve told him I’ll never call him Riggs and he seems to be okay with that.

“Are you okay, Willow?” he asks me, looking down my body to make sure I’m not hurt.

“I’m okay, Trenton. Today is just another day in my life. How mad is Otter?” I return, knowing I already messaged him from the car.

“He’s not mad. Worried, but not mad. You know he never gets mad at you. I’m headin’ out to grab some coffee. Do you want anythin’ while I’m out?”

“No, thank you. I’ll be okay until lunch.”

Trenton holds the door open for me before letting it shut as he goes to get coffee for everyone. Making my way down the hall of the shop, I give a small wave to Karsyn who’s already tattooing his first client of the day. Getting a chin lift in response, I continue on my way to the front desk. I can already see the computer on and waiting for me to get started. There’s also paperwork to be filed in the bin sitting on top of the counter. It must be from Karsyn’s client.

As I go to pull out my chair, I trip over nothing at all and stumble. Just when I have a tight grip on the chair I sit in and think I’ve got my feet back under me, the chair goes flying to the side leaving me to fall forward once more. I slam my head into the computer monitor before hitting the edge of the desk. Pain instantly ricochets through my head and I know I’ve bitten my tongue. Blood fills my mouth and I can barely hear anything around me as I slump to the floor. I try to shake the pain and fog filling my mind away, but only cause more pain to fill me. I managed to really hurt myself this time.

“Willow? Are you okay? What the fuck happened?” Otter’s voice penetrates the fog filling my mind.

“I-I’m o-o-okay,” I stammer out, my voice barely above a whisper as I force the bile back down so I’m not embarrassing myself even more.

“Let’s get you into the break room. I need to clean up your head and see how bad the damage is,” my boss says.

I hold out my hand fully expecting him to help me to my feet and walk behind me to the break room we have here. Otter bends down in front of me as my vision returns to normal and lifts me up in his arms. My bag falls to the floor at his feet, spilling the contents all over the floor.

“I-I-I can walk,” I tell him, my entire body tight as his arms wrap tighter around my body and I place my hands on his shoulders.

“I know you can. However, we’ve seen this mornin’ isn’t goin’ to be a good one for you. So, why don’t you let me carry you back there and see how bad the wound on your head is?” he returns, his voice gentle compared to when he’s barking out orders at us all.

I don’t bother responding. Otter isn’t looking for a response right now. He’s going to do what he wants to do and there’s no arguing with him. If I’ve learned anything about him since I got hired, it’s that Otter has a mind of his own and nothing will sway him once he’s made it up about something. Plus, I’ve seen way more of my boss than I ever thought I’d see. I’ve caught Otter in more than one compromising position when I’ve walked in a room to clean it. I thought he was done with his session and he was. He was just fucking the client in the chair after completing her tattoo. It’s hard to look at a man when you’ve seen parts of him you shouldn’t see.

Otter gently lays me on the couch after entering our break room. He rushes to the sink and grabs the towel I switch out every day to dry the dishes we may use. My eyes are locked on him as he wets the towel and rings it out before making his way back over to me. I lean back as he carefully wipes the blood from my face. So much for doing my make-up today!

“This looks horrible, Willow. I’m gonna call the club’s doctor in to have a look at things. Make sure you don’t need to go have your head checked or get stitches. I know head wounds bleed like a bitch, but this is really bad,” Otter informs me as he continues wiping the sticky mess from my face, neck, and upper chest. I guess I really did a number on myself this time.

“I don’t think I need stitches or anything, Otter. I appreciate it, but it’s not necessary. I’ll put a Band-Aid on it and get to work. I’m already late because of the mess at home,” I tell him, knowing I’m losing money every second I’m back here and not at the desk.

“Willow,” is the only thing he says, his voice a low warning for me not to argue with him.

Like I said, when Otter gets something in his mind, there’s no changing it. Stubborn man!

Once I’m cleaned up, Otter gets another towel and wets it before bringing it back over to me. He makes me lay down flatter on the couch before placing it over the cut I have on my forehead. At the same time, Trenton walks in the breakroom. I can smell the coffee he went to get.

“What the fuck happened to Willow?” he questions, his tone harder than normal. “This isn’t from the parkin’ lot, is it?”

“What the fuck happened in the parkin’ lot?” Otter returns, his voice cold and hard. Something I haven’t heard from him before.

“I was goin’ out as Willow was comin’ in. She almost went flyin’ but I stopped her from hittin’ the ground. I didn’t know she hit her damn head. Why didn’t you say anythin’?” Trenton responds, moving closer to me as I peek through the bottom edge of the towel covering my upper face.

“It wasn’t from that. I tripped on my way to my desk. Hit the monitor, the edge of the desk, and then collapsed on the floor,” I tell him, not wanting him to think this is his fault for any reason. “Just another day in my life.”

Neither man find this situation funny. I guess I really can’t blame them because I am bleeding all over the place. However, I’m used to this kind of stuff happening.

“I thought I was done dealin’ with this shit when I left home. I don’t know who’s worse, Willow. You or my mom,” Otter mumbles.

“Stay with her. I’m gonna call Doc in and check her desk out. Make sure we don’t need a new computer. Willow, don’t fuckin’ move from this couch,” Otter barks out his orders before leaving Trenton and me in the breakroom.

Trenton doesn’t say a word as he sets the tray of coffees on the table and brings a garbage can back over with him. I appreciate the gesture as nausea still fills me. I’ve definitely messed my head up this time. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a head injury bad enough where I felt as if I were going to be sick like this.

“Thank you, Trenton,” I murmur, my voice lower than normal as embarrassment and shame fill me.

I’ve learned to live with my clumsiness—it’s happened all my life. If Otter has to replace the computer and stuff because of me, I don’t know how I’ll ever look at the guys I work with on a daily basis again. They’ve seen my stellar falls and stuff, but this is a whole new level of clumsiness in front of them. One I hate anyone knowing about.

Trenton doesn’t try to talk to me as I close my eyes and try to focus on my breathing. In my mind, if I can control my breathing, I won’t get sick. At least that’s my hope. It doesn’t always work like that though. For now, I’m just going to lay here and see what the club’s doctor has to say. Hopefully Otter will let me stay late in order to make up the time I’m losing right now. I can’t afford to lose any money.

# Chapter 2

Chapter Two

Otter

THIS FUCKING GIRL! I don’t know what the hell is going on with Willow, but the girl can’t go one day without some catastrophe happening to her. She needs to come with a damn warning label or something. With the exception of my mom, I have never met another person in my life who is so damn clumsy. My mom and Willow take that shit to the extreme and I wish there was something I could do to make it better for them. Unfortunately, I can’t. Though, I will say, today is the worst Willow has ever been hurt and I wish I weren’t in my office in order to stop it from happening. Karsyn, Riggs, and I have all gotten used to making sure Willow stays out of trouble as much as we can. One of us is usually close by her as soon as she steps foot in the shop. It’s one of the reasons we also don’t let her go get our meals or anything. I can just see her making a mess of herself on the way back.

Walking into the main room of Inked Up, Karsyn looks at me in a silent question. He wants to make sure Willow’s okay, but can’t just leave his client on the chair in the middle of a tattoo. Shaking my head, I let him know I’m not sure if she’s okay or not. Pulling out my phone, I call Doc. Hopefully she’s not too busy and can get here quickly. Head wounds are always so hard to determine what needs to happen. Not just from the bleeding either. Willow could have given herself a damn concussion or something else.

“Otter, what’s going on?” Doc asks me as she answers her phone.

“Kind of hopin’ you ain’t busy right now. Willow needs to be checked out and I don’t want to take her to the hospital if she doesn’t need to go. She’s got a head injury and I can’t figure out how bad it really is. I know those always bleed the worst, but she could need stitches or other medical help,” I inform her as I make my way to the computer.

“Who’s Willow?” Doc returns, her voice rushed as I hear her moving around in the background.

“She’s the receptionist at Inked Up. Took a header into her computer monitor, hit the desk, and then the floor. Bleedin’ real bad. I cleaned her up and put a clean, wet towel on the wound so she’s not covered in blood again. I don’t know what else to do to make it better or help her. I’ve got her lyin’ down right now in the breakroom. She hasn’t been sick yet, but she’s even paler than normal. Riggs is back there with her right now,” I inform Doc as I try to turn on the computer.

“Okay. That’s good, Otter. Keep an eye on her. I’ll be there in ten or fifteen minutes,” Doc says before hanging up.

Setting my phone on the desk in front of the computer, I try again to turn the computer on. It’s not starting at all. Though, I really shouldn’t be surprised because I can see the cracks in the screen already. Shaking my head, I pick my phone back up and call Goose. He’s gonna lose his shit about this. I just had brand-new computers brought in here.

“What’s up, Otter?” he answers the phone.

“Need a new computer at Inked Up as soon as you can get it here,” I say, waiting for him to yell and lecture me.

“What the fuck happened in the last week since I installed the new ones? Are you guys goin’ on fuckin’ porn sites?” he questions, complete silence in the background with him.

“Had an incident this mornin’. Willow got tripped up and slammed her head into the computer before hittin’ the desk,” I state, knowing he won’t say a word about it to her.

“Is she okay?”

“Got Doc comin’ in to look her over. She’ll be here soon. Don’t wanna take her to the hospital if I don’t have to.”

“Okay. I’ll be there in a few minutes. Let me load this shit up and I’ll get everythin’ taken care of,” Goose states before hanging up the phone.

Bending down, I pick Willow’s bag up and toss everything back inside. I’m surprised she can find a damn thing in here with how much shit she carries on a daily basis. Picking up her phone last, I take a look at it. I know she’s got a piece of shit flip phone, but I didn’t realize how banged up and damaged the damn thing really is. The technology is outdated, the screen is cracked, and most of the numbers on the buttons are worn off. I don’t know how this damn thing still works. It’s a fucking miracle if you ask me.

Once I have all of her things picked up, the desk cleared off so Goose can replace the computer, and clean the edge of the desk off, I make my way back to the breakroom. Trenton is kneeling down next to Willow and a feeling of rage fills me as he smiles down at her. Willow isn’t mine, but part of me believes she is. This fucking girl pulls at every fucking piece of me she can reach and has no clue about it.

Standing back, I allow myself to take a long look at her. Willow’s vibrant red hair is fanned out behind her head like flames covering the black couch beneath her. The curls are all over the place and tangled together. A few pieces of her hair stick to her face from the blood and wet towel. Her eyes are closed showing how long her lashes really are against her pale skin. Freckles litter her skin and I want to find out how far down her body they go and count every single one of them. She’s wearing a black tank top today that does nothing to hide her ample chest. With the way she’s laying, I’m surprised the shirt hasn’t slipped and shown us more of the deep red bra she’s wearing. The long, flowing skirt Willow’s wearing today is a rainbow of colors. It’s fanned out around her legs and goes down to her ankles. I’ve never seen her wear anything that is above her knee, and her tank tops are the closest to form fitting clothing she wears. As always, on her feet are a pair of flip flops. Today’s are black and they show off her red painted nails. Willow always has her nails painted a different color. I swear she changes it on a weekly basis.

Ripping my eyes from Willow, I find Riggs watching me with a smirk on his face. He doesn’t say anything as I stare him down, waiting for a comment or something to leave his mouth. He might be the newest patched member of our club, but he can be a damn smartass. And, I’ve noticed, he’s very protective of Willow. I’m not sure what he feels for her on his end, but if it’s the last thing I do, he won’t be with her. I’m the only man Willow needs in her fucking life. Unfortunately, she’s caught me a time or two with a client here at the shop and I know she won’t give me the time of day. Willow only really speaks to me when she absolutely has to.

“Doc on her way?” Riggs finally asks me.

“She is. Should be here any second,” I tell him as my phone vibrates in my pocket. Pulling it out, I find my mom’s name on the screen. “Hey, Mom. What’s goin’ on?”

“Not much, Axel. How are things down there?” she answers, sounding out of breath.

“They’re good. Waitin’ on Doc to show up for an employee. Why are you out of breath?” I ask, hoping one of my dads aren’t home with her because that’s something I don’t need to think about.

“I was putting up some towels in the salon and well, the chair wasn’t as sturdy as I thought it was. I’m okay,” she rushes out, trying to add some laughter to her voice.

“Are you sure you’re okay? Or are you just sayin’ that shit to make me feel better knowin’ I’m not there?” I question her, knowing my mom has downplayed accidents in the past and really has been hurt.

“Well, I mean, I fell on the dryer so I didn’t hit the floor. That’s a win in my book,” she states and I know she’s more than likely hurt and won’t say anything to anyone. “Why is Doc coming to you? Are you hurt?”

“No. I’m okay. Like I said, it’s for an employee. She got hurt and I want to make sure she doesn’t need to go to the hospital,” I respond as Willow turns on the couch to face me with a glare aimed in my direction. Yeah, she’s got some claws at certain times.

“What happened to Willow?” Mom immediately asks, knowing already all about Willow.

“She got tripped up. Just want to make sure she’s okay. Doc should be here any second. Can I call you back in a little bit?”

“Of course you can. Let me know she’s okay. And, don’t tell you dads about this, Axel. I know you and if one of them show up, I’ll be making a trip to Cedar Bay,” my mom threatens as I tell her I haven’t talked to them yet.

Hanging up the phone, I turn to find Doc walking into the breakroom. She looks at me and turns her attention immediately to Willow on the couch. Doc steps up next to her as Riggs moves the garbage can out of her way.

“Willow, I’m Dr. Tallman. Everyone in the club just calls me Doc. How are you feeling?”

I lean back against the wall and watch everything being done to Willow. She answers Doc’s questions, winces when she examines the wound on her head, and listens to everything being said to her. I can barely hear what Willow’s responses are because her voice is barely above a whisper on a good day. Today, it seems as if her voice is even quieter and I don’t like it. Riggs stands next to me and watches the scene before us.

“I don’t believe you have a concussion or a need to go to the hospital, Willow. You don’t even need stitches. Head wounds always seem so much worse than they actually are. It’s done bleeding now and I will put some ointment on it and a bandage. I want you to change the bandage a few times a day and make sure the ointment goes on as well. It will help prevent any infection from setting in. Don’t get the bandages wet either, Willow. We don’t want this to open up for any reason. You’ll have a headache for a few days. If it becomes unbearable, I want you to go to the hospital immediately. Don’t wait or make excuses not to go,” Doc states, already knowing Willow more than likely won’t get medical help if she needs it.

“Thank you, Dr. Tallman. I told Otter he didn’t need to bring you down here for this,” Willow complains as Doc puts the ointment and bandage on her head.

“He did the right thing. So much can go wrong with a head injury and there’s no reason to take unnecessary risks or chances. So, if the headache becomes unbearable, don’t wait to go to the hospital,” Doc warns Willow in a stern voice she rarely uses.

Willow carefully nods her head and asks if she can still work today. What the fuck? She still wants to work after slamming her head off a damn computer and the desk. This woman is going to be the death of me! Doc lets her know she can work, but if her headache gets worse, she’s to go get some rest and not push herself for the next few days. Willow won’t be pushing herself for any reason if I have a say in the matter.

Doc leaves after I let her know I’ll make sure the funds get transferred to her as always. Riggs stays with Willow while I make my way out to see if Goose is here yet. Walking back out on the main floor, I find him already in Willow’s seat and setting up the new computer. He’s already taken care of the old one and I don’t even see it around anymore. The man works fast as hell and knows what he’s doing.

“Goose. Thanks for comin’ down so quick,” I greet him as I lean against the desk at his side.

“Can’t have you fallin’ behind on work because you can’t access anythin’. This will be ready to go in a few minutes. It already has all the software and shit you guys use here installed. I have a few more sittin’ at the clubhouse from the new setup. They’re all ready to go if you ever wanna expand the shop,” he informs me, not taking his eyes off what he’s doing.

“That’s good to know. I don’t believe I’ll be expandin’ anytime soon, but it’s always possible. You never know what the future holds,” I say, looking at Karsyn as he finishes up the tattoo he’s been working on.

“How’s Willow doin’?”

“She’s okay. Probably have a headache for the next few days and can’t push herself. Didn’t need stitches either. Got some ointment on it and Doc put a bandage on the spot on her head. She’s gotta change it out a few times a day,” I answer him, wanting to be back there with her instead of out here.

“That’s good to hear. I’ll take care of sendin’ over Doc’s payment as soon as I’m done here.”

Nodding my head, I make my way back to the breakroom. Goose doesn’t need any help and I’ll only be in his way if I stay with him. Karsyn is ready to cash his client out and then I’m sure he’ll be back here to check on Willow for himself. We all kind of have a soft spot for her. It bothers me, but there’s not anything I can do about them talking to her or checking on her when they know something is wrong. Hell, out of all of us, I’m keeping the biggest secrets from her and I don’t know how she’ll feel once she finds out the truth. Something we as a club should have told her when it happened. Plus, there’s the whole wanting her as mine thing she doesn’t know about. I try not to let anyone know, but I’m sure I’m failing at that as well.

Willow is now sitting up on the couch and the wet towel has been removed. There are still faint traces of blood on her face and neck I couldn’t get off when I cleaned her up. Riggs is sitting next to her as they talk quietly about something. Again, I’m filled with a deep rage aimed at the newest member of the club. I want to walk over there, rip him off the couch, and make sure he knows he’s not to be that close to my woman ever again. I already know Willow won’t appreciate me doing that shit. She doesn’t like when I bark out orders and shit. Something I always seem to do whenever she’s around.

“How are you feelin’?” I ask Willow, crouching down in front of her and moving her hair away from the taped edges of the bandage.

“My head is throbbing. I’m sorry about all this, Otter. I don’t know what the hell I fell over.

“Don’t even worry about it. Goose is almost done with the computer and then we can get you out to the desk. If your head starts hurtin’ worse, I want you to tell me immediately. One of us will take you home and get you settled in,” I tell her, my voice leaving no room for arguments from her.

“He had to replace the computer, didn’t he?” she questions me, tears filling her eyes as she looks away from me.

“He did. He’s still got some computers and shit from when we replaced all the shit in here. It’s not a big deal, Willow. The only important thing is that you’re okay and don’t need to go to the hospital,” I assure her, resting my hand on her thigh as she trembles beneath my touch.

Willow might not ever admit that she likes me or finds me attractive, but I can certainly read her body. Whenever I get close to her, she not only turns a bright red, but she also shivers whenever I touch her. Her skin breaks out in goosebumps and there’s no disguising her reaction to me. It’s something I love seeing, but still have yet to take any steps to make her mine. I don’t know if I ever will because Willow is too sweet and good for me. She’s too good for everyone around her if I’m being honest with myself. And I sense her hiding a past none of us have any clue about. One we only got a small glimpse into when we found her father burning our shit down.

“I’m gonna stay late today. To make up for being late and all this stuff happening. Don’t tell me I’m not going to do this, Otter. Please. I need the money and can’t afford the cut in my hours,” Willow states, trying to be harder than she actually is.

I want to laugh at her attempt of putting me in my place, but I can’t. Willow would not only see it as me laughing at her, but it would hurt her deeper than anything else. She’s sensitive as fuck and I’m not about to hurt her for any reason.

“Okay, Willow. If your head doesn’t bother you too much. Like I said, if it gets worse, you’ll be goin’ home and we’ll figure out your hours and pay later on,” I warn her, my voice letting her know I’ll be keeping a close eye on her.

Karsyn makes his way back in the breakroom and checks on Willow. We all remain in there while Goose finishes up the computer at her desk. Once he’s done, the four of us make our way out to the main floor and wait for our next clients to come in for their appointments. Along with anyone who may walk in. We always have walk-ins at Inked Up. Usually girls wanting something small and ridiculous just so they can say they’ve been here. Or that we’ve had our hands on their body. After the last time Willow caught me fucking a client in the back, I haven’t touched another one. I won’t put her through that shit. Even if she does like watching. Cause she didn’t leave as soon as she realized what was going on. Another thing I haven’t ever called her out on.

# Chapter 3

Chapter Three

Willow

IT’S BEEN A week since the incident happened at work and Goose had to come in to replace the computer. I feel like such a damn fool despite everyone telling me not to worry about it. Nothing too bad has happened at Inked Up since then, but I can’t say the same thing for when I’ve been home. My sink in the kitchen needed to be repaired and I tried to do it myself. It didn’t work out so good for me. If anything, I flooded my kitchen even more than the previous time and made a complete mess of everything. Finally, I relented and called in a plumber to take care of the problem. Spending money I don’t have to spend on something I can’t do myself. The joys of owning your own home I guess.

I’d let the house go if it weren’t for my mom’s gardens I still maintain and keep filled with the same flowers she used to plant when I was younger. Other than that, it’s nothing to boast about. The house is in desperate need of repair, the yard is browner than anything else, and I have hardly any good memories here. Not to mention it’s not in the best section of Cedar Bay. We really don’t have a truly horrible section now that the pimps and dealers have been kicked out of town. However, where my house is located is considered where all the poor people live. Again, I don’t have many good memories here so if it weren’t for my mom’s flowers, I’d leave this place in a heartbeat and never look back. Go somewhere no one else knows me and Jared can’t find me. I’ll do anything to avoid my brother.

Otter and the guys have been keeping a close eye on me since I tripped and fell all over my desk. If it even looks like my head is bothering me, they’re ready to send me home, put me to bed, and not let me get up again until it goes away. Otter is the worst of all three guys I work with. He wants to wrap me up in bubble wrap and make sure nothing happens to my head. I’m not even covering the cut up with a bandage anymore. It hasn’t bled since the day it happened, and my head honestly hurts less than the day it happened. I’m going to have to have a long talk with these guys about babying me, but it won’t be today or even this week.

Today has been a long day and I’m ready to go home, take a hot bubble bath, and then go to bed. When Jared was still around, I never took a bath for any reason. I didn’t trust him to leave me alone in the bathroom. Then, David moved in and I learned to spend even less time in the bathroom. It didn’t take me very long to figure out locks mean absolutely nothing to the two of them and they do what the hell they want when they want. Especially David. He was always trying to catch me in the bathroom alone.

Now, I can take a hot bath and spend as much time as I want to in there. I might even light a candle or two if I’m feeling up to it. I’m just hesitant to do so because the last time I did that, I fell asleep in the tub. The last thing I need to worry about is starting a fire because I lit a candle and then fell asleep.

“You headin’ out, Willow?” Otter walks up to the desk as I put the last of the paperwork away and make sure everything is put away.

I always clean the desk when I leave the shop so the guys don’t have to work around anything I might leave out when I’m not here. Otter doesn’t let me work until closing and I’m not sure why. I haven’t worked up the courage to ask him about it yet. The guys all work until late at night or early morning depending on how you look at it. I’m only ever scheduled to work until maybe ten at night. And it’s rare I’m scheduled that late. Maybe they party or something in the shop and don’t want me knowing about it.

It started with a feeling of mucus build up in the Nasopharynx two Months ago. The Mucus is clear and sometimes cloudy and really really sticky and I think I feel it more on the left side of the throat. Since two weeks I started to feel a little bit sick every second day, like I have a sore throat and sometimes a tickly feeling. The feelings are worse in the mornings and my throat is maybe a little bit irritated but nothing worse as far as I can see.
I am taking Esomepratzol 20 mg in the Morning since two years because I have a Hiatushernia( 2cm) and had some Gerdsymptoms. 
It's also not the first time I had throat symptoms on that side. From 2020 to 2022 I had Problems with a foreign body sensation also on the right side of the upper throat. After most of the tests showed nothing special except some lymphoid tissue hyperblasia (like a little bit cobblestone Throat) the ENT suspected tonsil stones. The feeling disappeared some time after I had an Corona Infection and stopped smoking.
Since than I had no problems until two months ago. 
I already tried a lot of stuff like doubling my ppi intake, Antihistamines, Saltwater gargeling and rinses with no or maybe little relief. Otherwise I am eating healthy, I exercise and have a normal weight and don't drink much and also don't smoke anymore. I drink one to two Coffees in the morning.

The diary—water-stained, reeking of burnt copper and chili paste—was found clutched in the hands of the sixth body, which, unlike the others, showed no signs of physical trauma.*

*Official reports dismissed the entries as the ravings of a psychotic break, citing the ""impossible"" forensic details (e.g., scars matching wounds on the corpses, despite no prior injuries; voice recordings with no known speaker). But the handwriting analysis was conclusive: every word was written by the same hand, in the same ink, over the same 72-hour period.\]*

I remember my first death in a dream.

On the twenty-third of February, I awoke and realized I was dead. This was no metaphor: in that world—where the asphalt proved harder than my bones—I had crashed my motorcycle at exactly 6:45. Yet here, where the alarm clock had just torn me from sleep, I already knew something was wrong. The hand reaching for the switch felt alien, as if moved not by muscles but by invisible strings.

Since then, every night, I die again and again, and each death unveils new horrors of the cosmos.

Three days ago, I drowned in a black liquid filling the underground reservoirs of a city that should not exist. The day before yesterday—I decomposed alive in a morgue where corpses whispered in a tongue that made my eyes bleed. And last week, I was executed by a firing squad for desertion—in a version of the world where the war began ten years prior. But the most unbearable part is that I remain there. I do not vanish, do not dissolve into the dark—I linger, like a splinter lodged in the universe’s consciousness. I am a ghost, chained to the site of my demise, forced to watch as others live their ordinary lives.

You might think it's nonsense, but the physical traces prove otherwise.

Before a storm, a scar appears on my neck—a remnant from the ""world of the hanged man."" It does not hurt, but when I touch it, I feel as though invisible fingers from the other side of reality are testing the rope’s tension.

In the mornings, my mouth tastes of blood. Not metal, not salt—but blood, thick and warm, as in the ""world of dental sepsis."" It lasts only seconds, but that is enough to make me feel like a corpse on a hospital bed again. Then the memories fade, like rain-washed graffiti on pavement, and I return to my routine: brewing coffee, answering emails, pretending everything is fine.

Sometimes, in a certain light, I see them. My corpses. They stir in the shadows, their fingers scraping at the edges of reality as if trying to break through. One—with a shattered skull—even waves at me like an old acquaintance. I have learned not to look their way, but I feel them watching me.

I am compiling undeniable proof to validate the reality of all that is unfolding.

Now, before sleep, I place a tape recorder by my bedside. By morning, the tape is always filled—with my own voice, yet unlike any I have ever heard: hoarse, crushed by fear. Sometimes there are words: ""Don’t wake up,"" ""They’re waiting,"" ""This is not a dream."" More often—just screaming.

I record everything in this notebook. Perhaps one day it will serve as evidence. Or a warning.



**The Entity Called ""The Director""**

He visits me in dreams, taking the form of a man with a film camera for a head. His lens—black, bottomless, always slick, as if coated in cosmic slime—does not speak but creaks like old film jammed in a projector.

""Tonight, you are the bridge jumper,"" he whispers, and I wake with headphone wires coiled tightly around my neck.

My double from World-4 (the one where I became a scientist) insists this is an experiment in quantum immortality. That somewhere, there is a lab where versions of me die over and over, their final moments recorded by devices operating on principles unknown to our science.

But I know the truth.

Sleep doctors are not researchers. They are technicians.

Their machines do not study sleep—they broadcast death. This became clear after the polysomnography, when my ribs ached for three days—exactly as in the ""car crash world,"" where I died at an intersection. And the electrode marks on my wrists resembled handcuff bruises.

But I believe I can break this vicious cycle.

Chili pepper keeps fear from dragging me too far. So before sleep, I eat it until my tongue swells and tears blur the boundary between realities. Pain here is my anchor.

But one anchor is not enough.

Before sleeping, I wrap myself in foil—sticky, cold, rustling like a dead cicada’s husk. In my hand, I clutch a metal hoop torn from an old lampshade. This ""grounds"" my consciousness, keeps it from slipping into other worlds.

But the most crucial part—sabotage.

In the ""falling-from-the-roof world,"" I grabbed a pipe at the last moment. In the ""overdose world,"" I spat out all the pills, even as my throat clenched in a chemical fog. The Director was furious.

It seems to be working.

*\[Editor’s note: Two pages violently ripped out here\]*



**Final Entry**

Today, the Director said:

""Tomorrow is the finale. You will die here.""

I will not sleep.

I will drink energy drinks, shock myself with a stun gun, scream until the neighbors call the police.

But if my eyes close anyway...

1lrbs2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1lrbs2v/was_this_an_emotional_affair_i_feel_crazy/,Was this an emotional affair? I feel crazy,"Hi everyone. Glad if you  give me your POVs on that.

It's been a month since my relationship with my (32f) ex (38m) ended. He broke up with me at the end of May, telling me that I'm not the person he wants in his life, but things had been going badly for a few months and the relationship would have ended anyway because I couldn't take it anymore.

In December of last year, his ex - with whom he had been 'friends' for about ten years and he labeled as ""crazy"" - contacted him again after a year of silence (Nov. '23 they went into a big fight during which she had physically assaulted him, then blocked himm everywhere). Since the beginning of our relationship (a week before this fight) I felt that he wasn't really over her and that I was a fallback. For the first few months of the relationship he called me by her name a lot, one night he even said ""I wish you'd stay over at my place but I'm afraid to say her name in my sleep"". Looking back, I think I was so dumb.

Anyway, in December she got back in touch. He told me right away, saying that rationally he knew her behavior was unforgivable but, in fact, he didn't know what to do. Eventually he decided to try to rebuild this 'friendship', claiming she was too important to him.

Problems started around March. Initially, he told me that he only texted her every now and then because he knew that if he decided to meet her, it would hurt me too much. However just a few weeks later he changed his mind and decided to catch up wuth her for coffee (she asked for it).

I told him right away that I didn't like this situation, that it made me suffer and he knew it very well. I asked him why he had changed his mind, but for every question he never had a clear answer. It was always ""I don't know"". One evening, emotionally destroyed by all this, I told him to choose, 'either me or her'. He told me that his friendship was too important and he didn't want to give it up (but they hadn't even rebuilt this 'friendship' yet!), essentially chosing her over me. And then told me ""I decided  to met her bc I don't believe in us"".

I know that I should have left from that moment, but I was so in love and I decided to fight for what we had.

By then the situation degenerated rapidly. He asked her for a second met that never happened due to external factors. Then he asked her (again!) to catch up a third time. The chats increased dramatically, with him writing to her even on weekends when we were together.

After a bad argument between us he started to distance himself from me both physically and emotionally, at the same time writing to her more and more often. Not a day went by without a message,  sometimes a call, most of the time he was the one initiating contact. He told me he did it ""to pass the time"", but inside I felt that the closer he got to her, the further away he was from me. I tried several times to make him understand how much this situation was making me suffer, I asked him if he wanted to work on our relationship and try to rebuild the trust that he himself had destroyed by behaving this way towards me. The last time I asked him was three days before the breakup, and he said yes, but that he didn't know how to do it. ""By behaving in a way that is consistent with your words"", I said. I was speachless. He knew how to rebuild their friendship, but not how to work on us?

The day before I left her we argued again, always for the same reason. That mornign he went almost radiosilence with me, and then I found out he was chatting with her (again, he initiated contact). I was livid.

She knew I was ""very jealous"" (he told her so) and every time she wrote to him she said ""I don't want to mess up your life"". His answer was always the same, for months: ""You're not messing it up"". All this while I cried every day and constantly told him that he was hurting me badly.

I repeatedly told him that their relationship was a problem for me, while he always stated that ""the problems between us are others"". And he also said that to other people he confided in, constantly invalidating my feelings.

I tried in every way and I never succeeded, maybe not even after the breakup when I told him that for several nights in a row I woke up from nightmares that had the two of them as protagonists. I was so devastated and my trust was so gone to the point that, in the last weeks of our rel., I started thinking ""If we were to have a child/a miscarriage he'll invest his time in making her laught than supporting me.""

This situation destroyed me more than I could have imagined, and after more than a month from the BU I still ask myself if I'm crazy or if this really was emotional cheating. I'm drained by it all, always questioning myself. I believe he gaslighted me and, in doing so, succeeded in making me doubt myself and my ability to see things as they are. I can't trust myself anymore and the worst thing ever is that I can't believe it \*really\* happenede. As if it was all in my mind.

When she got back to the villa, it was already dark.

It's too big here, so big that she often gets lost.

The only familiar thing was the photo on the coffee table. In the picture, Howard had his arm around her waist, looking down at her with eyes so gentle they could melt the snow of winter.

She gently touched the photo, suddenly remembering that rainy night three years ago.

That year, she found Howard at the end of the alley, covered in blood and with a vacant look in his eyes.

""Who are you?"" she asked him.

""I... don't remember."" He shook his head blankly, rain mixed with blood dripping from his hair.

And so, she brought the amnesiac man back home.

The old shabby apartment, only thirty square meters, was cramped for the two of them.

The wall was peeling, the pipes were leaking, and she had to use three blankets to keep warm in winter.

It's just in this poorest place that the purest love was born.

They relied on each other and became each other's everything from then on.

He waited downstairs for three hours while she was working overtime, just to walk her home.

When she was sweating and in pain during her period, I stayed up all night massaging her stomach.

He worked five jobs in secret for a day, just to buy her an expensive necklace that she couldn't bear to buy after looking at it three times.

The only thing that she couldn't stand was that he would cling to her every night.

She blushed and begged for mercy, he chuckled lowly while biting her earlobe, ""Baby, only because I love you so much.""

The year they loved each other the most, he even took her to a tattoo shop and got her name tattooed on his collarbone.

The tattoo artist asked him if he was afraid of pain, but he just looked at her and smiled, ""Pain is good, that way you won't forget the person you love the most.""

She thought they would be happy forever.

Until he recovered his memory.

She just found out that, turns out, he wasn't a poor guy wandering the streets, but the prince of the Wiggins family in Yaclax, the heir to half of the financial circle, back then, he was just set up by his archenemy, causing him to have amnesia from a car accident and end up on the streets.

After recovering his identity, Howard moved into a 2,000-square-foot mansion with Gretchen. The bathroom alone was ten times bigger than her original home.

But he, from then on, seemed like a different person.

He wore a designer suit that she couldn't even recognize, a priceless watch, talked about multi-million dollar deals, and didn't come home all night.

She was fooling herself, ""He was just too busy.""

Until that day, entertainment headlines were filled with rumors about him and the Crawley Group heiress Veronica Crawley.

In the photo, he was wearing a designer suit, opening the car door for her, and they were smiling at each other, which made her eyes hurt.

The comments section is all talking about ""marrying someone from the same background"" and ""a match made in heaven.""

At that moment, she sat alone by the window, staring at the moon all night, and finally realized a fact.

That Howard who used to pick her up from work in the snow, buy her necklaces with his hard-earned money, and tattoo her name on his collarbone, died on the day he regained his memory.

The Wiggins family's son is like night and day compared to her.

He stood on the cloud, she was stuck in the mud.

Just like the moon can never reach the dust, a person like him is destined to be with someone equally dazzling.

If so, why did she bring it on herself?

Let it go.

Let him go, let yourself go.

That night, the villa was still empty, Howard still hadn't returned.

Gretchen didn't wait up for him until the early hours like she used to. Instead, she went to bed early and then headed to the visa center as soon as it was light out.

She went through the express lane, and her visa and passport were ready within a week.

When Gretchen walked out of the visa center, it was already noon. She randomly picked a restaurant.

The moment she pushed the door open, her footsteps hesitated slightly.

Sitting by the window, Howard was gently wiping Veronica's mouth with a tissue.

That look was so gentle that it could melt the ice in the coldest winter, just like when we used to kiss and laugh together in the rented room.

Gretchen stood there, feeling like her heart was being squeezed by an invisible hand.

She turned around to leave, but accidentally knocked over the potted plant by the door.

Howard looked up when he heard a sound and saw Gretchen, the warmth in his eyes fading instantly.

He walked slowly towards her, his thin lips slightly parted, his voice low and cold: ""Are you following me?""

Before I could even speak, he said again, ""I've already explained to you about those online rumors, it's just about business cooperation. How long are you going to keep making a fuss?""

Gretchen opened her mouth to explain, but her throat felt like it was stuffed with cotton.

Brianna's words from yesterday are still ringing in my ears: ""Howard and Veronica's marriage was arranged by their families long ago, and he really likes Veronica himself...""

Is it the kind of cooperation that is like a marriage?

""Howard, don't be so mean."" Veronica also walked over, smiling and trying to smooth things over, ""It's fate that we met, let's sit together.""

Before Gretchen could refuse, Veronica just dragged her to their table.

Gretchen was pinned to the chair like a puppet, facing Howard's icy face.

""What does Ms. Belton want to eat?"" Veronica pushed the menu in front of her, ""The French cuisine here is very authentic.""

Gretchen stared at the French words on the menu that she couldn't understand at all, feeling embarrassed and awkward.

""I wasn't hungry,"" she pushed the menu away.

""Have some soup."" Veronica served a bowl of seafood soup in front of her. ""It's very fresh.""

Gretchen stared at the shrimp floating in the soup, her stomach twisting in pain.

She was seriously allergic to seafood.

Just as she was about to politely decline, Howard's phone rang.

He got up to answer the phone, his back straight like a pine tree.

She had seen that suit in a magazine before, enough to buy the whole neighborhood she used to live in.

""Give it a try."" Veronica suddenly lowered her voice, ""After all, with your status, you don't usually get to eat such expensive dishes.""

Gretchen suddenly looked up and met her smiling eyes.

""Do you really think that just because you had a fling with Howard, you can marry into a wealthy family?"" She tapped her fingers lightly on the edge of the cup, ""If it weren't for his amnesia, a low-class woman like you wouldn't even be worthy of shining his shoes.""

Gretchen clenched the napkin, the fabric crumpled in her palm.

She was poor, but that didn't give anyone the right to trample on her dignity like that. ""Ms. Crawley, we don't know each other, but you...""

""Oh no!""

Just as she was halfway through her sentence, Veronica suddenly screamed and accidentally knocked over the bowl of seafood soup, the scalding liquid splashing onto the back of her hand and splattering all over Gretchen's hands.

Howard turned back at the sound, his long fingers immediately gripping Veronica's hand. ""What's wrong?""

""It's nothing..."" Veronica's eyes were red and swollen, ""It's all my fault. Being caught having dinner alone with you, Ms. Belton as your girlfriend, she saw it and got angry. It's understandable...""

Howard immediately looked at Gretchen, with a cold expression on his face, ""Gretchen, I've explained it countless times, do you have to be like this?""

""I didn't, it was her own...""

""That's enough!"" he interrupted her, ""I saw it with my own eyes, how can it be fake? When did you become so unreasonable?""

After saying that, Howard just walked away without looking back, holding Veronica's head.

Veronica was leaning on his shoulder, slowly turned her head, and gave Gretchen a victorious smile.

Gretchen stood there, trembling, and reached out her hands, which were burned red.

The blister had already formed, hurting like a million needles poking.

In Howard's eyes, there was only that small patch of slightly red skin on Veronica.

He left so quickly, so decisively, didn't even give her a glance.

Howard could clearly see that she was the most caring.

Three years ago when she burned herself while cooking, he was so worried that his eyes turned red. He rushed to the pharmacy in the middle of the night to buy medicine. When he came back, he applied the medicine to her wound and asked, ""Grete, does it hurt?""

Back then, his eyes were all on her.

Now Howard can't see her anymore.

# Chapter 2

Gretchen went home.

When she got back, she dug out the first aid kit in the living room and did the disinfection, medication, and bandaging by herself.

The wound tingled with a sharp pain, like a bunch of ants gnawing at it.

Turning around and going upstairs, she accidentally caught sight of the grand piano in the corner of the living room.

That was bought by Howard after he regained his memory, saying he wanted to teach her how to play the piano.

But it's been so long, the dust has accumulated thickly on the piano cover.

Just like their relationship, it had long been covered in dust.

She turned red eyes, and started to quickly pack her luggage into the room.

She sorted out her clothes, documents, bank cards... one by one, moving very slowly, as if saying goodbye to her past self.

Halfway through tidying up, the door was suddenly pushed open.

Howard stood at the door, suit jacket draped over his arm, tie loose.

He saw her open suitcase and frowned, ""What are you doing?""

""Gather your things,"" Gretchen calmly replied, continuously bending down to fold clothes.

Howard frowned and approached, with a hint of perfume on him, the one Veronica used today.

He grabbed her wrist so hard that it made her frown in pain.

""Just because I had dinner with Veronica today, you want to run away from home? You hurt someone, Veronica didn't even argue with you, and you're the one throwing a tantrum?""

Gretchen looked up at him, the man's irritation was written all over his face.

""Veronica and I are old friends. She just returned to her home country, and her parents asked me to take care of her more. Can't you be more understanding?""

Mature?

The word ""stabbed into her heart like a knife,"" Gretchen clenched the clothes in her hand, the fabric crumpled in her palm.

She was already mature enough to leave, how much more mature does she need to be?

""Speak up!"" Howard suddenly raised his voice.

Gretchen turned around silently and continued packing her bags.

Her silence totally pissed off Howard.

""Fine, let's see how long you can keep this up.""

After saying that, he slammed the door and it ""bang"" shut, making her heart tremble.

The next morning, when Gretchen went downstairs, she saw Veronica sitting in the living room, chatting with Howard and smiling.

She wore a white dress today, with delicate makeup, looking pure and elegant.

Seeing Gretchen coming down, she immediately stood up, smiling sweetly and innocently, ""Ms. Belton, you're awake? My parents insisted that Howard take me to the auction today, don't think too much about it.""

Gretchen glanced at Howard, the man was busy fixing his cufflinks, didn't even give her a look.

""I didn't think much,"" she said softly, ""Your business has nothing to do with me.""

Howard's hand paused, his brow furrowing even tighter.

He was about to speak when Veronica cut in, saying, ""Why don't we invite Ms. Belton to come along? Since you don't have anything else to do anyway.""

Before Gretchen could refuse, Veronica had already affectionately linked her arm.

She was just pulled into the car like that.

The auction was lit up with bright lights, and it was packed with celebrities.

Howard sat in the front row, casually holding up signs with his slender fingers. He snapped up one piece of jewelry and luxury watch after another, then handed them over to Veronica beside him.

Veronica laughed gently, whispering in his ear from time to time, her affectionate gestures were dazzling.

""Howard, should we get some for Ms. Belton too?"" she suggested, pretending to be considerate.

Howard said casually, ""No, she's not used to these things.""

Veronica heard that, with a slight smile on her lips, she gave Howard a victorious smile from an angle he couldn't see.

Gretchen looked down, gently rubbing the auction catalog in her hand, feeling a chill in her heart.

Can't get used to it, or don't deserve it?

In his eyes, she was probably always the Cinderella who crawled out of the slums, even though she is standing next to him now, deep down she still doesn't match these luxurious things.

It's okay, anyway... before long, there won't be any relationship between them anymore.

Gretchen sat quietly in the corner, watching Howard shower Veronica with money, watching their intimate display as if she was just a bystander.

Until the last item was presented---

A jade bracelet.

Her breath caught in her throat, and her fingers clenched involuntarily.

That was grandma's keepsake!

Three years ago, Howard went to the construction site to move bricks in order to buy her a birthday gift. In the end, he fell from the site and almost lost his life.

To raise money for his surgery, she had to sell the bracelet her grandmother left her.

Later, when she had saved enough money to redeem it, the bracelet had already been bought by someone else.

She searched all the antique shops in town, but never saw it again.

And now, it just appeared in front of her out of the blue.

Gretchen's heart skipped a beat, and she almost instinctively raised the sign.

""One million.""

Veronica turned around and looked at her in surprise, then chuckled lightly and held up a sign, ""Three million.""

""Four million!""

""Five million!""

\*\*\*

After several rounds of bidding back and forth, Howard frowned and glanced between Gretchen and Veronica.

In the end, he raised his hand slightly and lit the sky lantern.

Bought at the highest price of the whole auction.

The auctioneer sealed the deal with a hammer: ""Congratulations, Mr. Wiggins!""

Amidst the uproar, he turned to Veronica and said, ""Since you like it, it's yours.""

The number plate in Gretchen's hand ""plopped"" onto the ground.

# Chapter 3

She stared blankly as the staff respectfully handed the bracelet to Veronica, who was smiling and reaching out to take it. Just as her fingertips touched the edge of the box, she suddenly exclaimed, ""Oops!""

""Bang!""

The jade bracelet slipped from the box and fell heavily onto the marble floor, breaking into two pieces.

At that moment, Gretchen's breath almost stopped, and all she could hear was the sharp sound of shattering.

Her mind went blank, and almost instinctively she rushed forward, pushing Veronica aside and trembling as she picked up the pieces on the ground.

Howard's face turned cold, he grabbed the staggering Veronica, and looked at Gretchen again, his voice low and stern, ""Gretchen, what are you doing?""

Gretchen looked up with red eyes, her voice trembling, ""What am I doing? This is my grandmother's heirloom! Didn't you say before that if you ever saw it again, you would definitely buy it back?""

""But now you don't even remember, right?""

Howard paused for a moment, as if remembering something, but quickly his expression turned cold again.

""How could I still remember something that happened so long ago?"" he said coldly, with a hint of anger. ""Besides, Veronica didn't do it on purpose. How could you just push someone like that?""

Veronica's eyes turned red, she pitifully tugged at his sleeve, saying, ""I'm sorry, it's all my fault...""

Howard furrowed his brow, wiped away her tears with his hand, and said in a low voice, ""It's none of your business.""

After saying that, he gave Gretchen a cold glance and said firmly, ""I will have someone fix this bracelet, so stop making a fuss.""

As soon as the words were spoken, he grabbed Veronica's shoulder, took the two broken bracelets, and left without looking back.

Gretchen stood there, watching their backs as they walked away, her heart feeling like it had been ripped out, hurting so much she could barely breathe.

When the auction ended, it was already raining outside.

Gretchen stood at the entrance of the venue, watching Howard's black Maybach drive away with Veronica.

The venue was quite remote, she waited for thirty minutes but couldn't hail a cab, so she had to walk back in the rain.

When she got home, her feet were so sore that she couldn't feel them anymore.

When she took off her high heels, the blister burst, sticking to her stockings, and she sucked in a breath of cold air in pain.

She was lying on the sofa, staring at the ceiling in a daze.

Suddenly remembered that rainy night a few years ago, Howard carried her three kilometers to the hospital.

Back then, he was so broke that he couldn't even afford a taxi, but he stubbornly refused to let her get out and walk a single step.

""Grete, hold on a little longer, we're almost there.""

His back was so warm, the rain hitting her felt sweet too.

What about now? He was driving a luxury car worth millions, but he wouldn't even wait five minutes for her.

She took the medicine, then buried herself under the covers, and fell asleep.

She didn't dare to think about recent events. Just thinking about it, all the sour grievances and pain would come flooding in.

No one knew, what she wanted was never the prince Yaclax Howard, she just wanted that Howard who squeezed with her in the shabby rental house, would laugh and call her Grete.

But he ""died"", and he can never come back.

She closed her eyes and let the tears flow.

The next day at noon, she was woken up by the sound of the door opening.

Howard stood by the bed, looking sharp in his suit.

""There was a family banquet in the evening, you went with me.""

# Chapter 4

""I didn't want him to notice anything unusual before I left, in case something happened,"" Gretchen remained silent for a moment, then nodded.

After that, I got up and went to the closet to pick out clothes, my ankle hurting.

Half an hour later, the two of them arrived at their destination.

The Wiggins' villa was brightly lit. When Gretchen followed Howard through the door, the first thing she saw was Veronica sitting on the sofa.

She was wearing an elegant Chanel suit, chatting intimately with Brianna, while Edwin Wiggins nodded and smiled on the side, creating a harmonious scene.

""Howard is here!"" Brianna greeted enthusiastically, completely ignoring Gretchen, and went straight to grab her son's arm, ""Veronica has been waiting for you for a long time.""

Howard paused for a moment, then instinctively glanced back at Gretchen.

He thought he would see her look of grievance, or at least a forced expression of sadness, but Gretchen just stood calmly on the side, as if all of this had nothing to do with her.

""Ms. Belton also came?"" Veronica pretended to be surprised, then smiled gently, ""Please have a seat, don't be shy.""

Brianna glanced at Gretchen and said coldly, ""Since you're here, just behave yourself and don't embarrass our family.""

Gretchen remained silent.

At the dinner table, Brianna and Veronica were gossiping about the socialite circle, Edwin and Howard were discussing company projects, and no one was talking to Gretchen.

She was like a ghost, quietly eating her food, with Brianna's sarcastic remarks ringing in her ears.

""Having similar backgrounds is really important.""

""Some girls, they just lack self-awareness.""

""Veronica and Howard grew up together since they were kids, they know each other inside out, a perfect match.""

Gretchen heard these words too many times.

At first, Howard used to interrupt with a cold face, then he just frowned and said, ""Mom, stop talking."" And now—

He didn't even frown.

Gretchen lowered her head and drank the soup. The hot soup slid down her throat, but it couldn't warm her cold heart.

After dinner, Howard drove them back home.

Veronica naturally sat in the passenger seat, Gretchen sat alone in the back seat.

In the car, there was Veronica's favorite song playing. She was smiling and discussing the dinner with Howard.

Gretchen looked at the blurry neon lights outside the window, suddenly remembered that winter, Howard rode a second-hand bicycle to take her home, she hugged his waist, and put her frozen hands in his coat pocket.

""Grete, when I had money, I would definitely buy a good car and never let you freeze again.""

Now he does have money, but it's not her sitting in the passenger seat.

The blinding headlights suddenly shone over, she didn't react in time, and then saw a truck out of control rushing towards them.

""Bang!""

In a loud crash, Gretchen saw Howard jump towards the passenger seat without hesitation, using his body to shield Veronica.

And she, was thrown forward by inertia, her forehead hitting the windshield, blood instantly blurring her vision.

In the last second before consciousness faded, she clearly heard the sound of her heart breaking.

Originally, even at a critical moment of life and death, he now no longer chooses her.

\*\*\*

When she woke up again, Gretchen found herself lying in a hospital bed.

The wound on her forehead was already bandaged, and the old injury on her ankle got worse. She was in so much pain that she couldn't move.

She stood up straight, the door of the ward was pushed open, Brianna walked in wearing high heels.

""Gretchen, didn't I tell you to go abroad?"" She looked down at Gretchen, her eyes full of disdain. ""You're still here, still dreaming of marrying into the Wiggins family?""

Gretchen looked at her calmly and said, ""No, the paperwork isn't done yet. Don't worry, as soon as the visa is approved, I'll leave immediately.""

She paused, ""She walked far away, he could never find her.""

Brianna sneered, ""Hope you walk the talk.""

As soon as the words fell, the door of the ward was pushed open again.

Howard stood at the door, looking gloomy. ""Leaving? Who's leaving?""

# Chapter 5

Gretchen lowered her eyelashes and lied, ""My aunt came to visit me, I told her I was fine and asked her to leave first.""

Brianna saw the situation and quickly pretended to care for a few words, then made an excuse and left.

There were only the two of them left in the ward.

""Before that..."" Howard walked to the edge of the bed, his voice a bit stiff, ""The car accident was so sudden, I didn't react in time.""

Gretchen lightly nodded and said, ""I know, it's okay.""

Howard paused for a moment and asked, ""Aren't you angry?""

""Don't be angry.""

Howard stared into her eyes, trying to find a trace of grievance or anger, but her gaze was as calm as still water.

He suddenly got a little annoyed, reached out to touch her face, ""Don't be angry, I...""

""I'm not really angry,"" Gretchen said, turning her head to avoid his touch, her tone light but firm, ""I want to rest. Ms. Crawley is also injured, so go and keep her company.""

After saying that, she closed her eyes and turned around.

She felt like Howard had been watching her by the bed for a long time, and finally, he left and closed the door.

In the following days, Howard would come every day.

He sat by the hospital bed dealing with documents, occasionally asking her, ""Does it hurt?"" She always shook her head.

But whenever she fell asleep and woke up again, there was always no one by her bedside, only nurses whispering.

""Ms. Crawley's boyfriend in the VIP ward next door is really nice, he stayed with her all night.""

""I heard he's still the heir of the Wiggins Group, good-looking and loyal.""

Gretchen closed her eyes, pretending not to hear.

On the day she was discharged, Howard personally came to pick her up.

Gretchen dragged her still-sore ankle to the front of the car, but froze when she tried to open the door.

Veronica sat in the passenger seat and gave her a gentle smile, ""Ms. Belton, do you mind if I catch a ride with you? I get a bit car sick, so I have to sit in the front seat.""

Howard frowned, as if wanting to explain something, but Gretchen cut in first, saying, ""It's okay.""

She calmly sat in the back seat, watching the backs of the two people in front of her like an outsider.

Howard glanced at her through the rearview mirror, hesitated to speak, and in the end, didn't say anything.

The car stopped in front of a luxurious villa, and Gretchen realized that Howard didn't take her home, but instead brought her to attend a prestigious elder's golden wedding anniversary party in the circle.

""Isn't that Mr. Wiggins? Why is he with two ladies?""

""Isn't that Gretchen in the white dress? I heard she came from the slums, her family was really average.""

""Ms. Crawley and Mr. Wiggins were a perfect match, they were a good fit.""

The guests were talking loudly, but Gretchen just stood quietly in the corner as if she hadn't heard anything.

Howard was with Veronica the whole time, getting her drinks, putting on her coat, and looking at her with eyes so gentle it was like they could drip water.

""Ms. Belton, I'll introduce you to some friends."" Veronica suddenly walked over and affectionately linked arms with Gretchen.

Gretchen didn't have time to refuse, she was pulled in front of a group of socialites.

""This is Gretchen, Howard's... girlfriend.""

Veronica introduced with a smile, then suddenly switched to fluent German, chatting with some socialites.

A few people were stunned for a moment, then quickly caught on and started chatting in German, occasionally bursting into laughter.

Gretchen stood there like a lonely island, isolated beyond the high walls of language.

""Ms. Belton?"" Veronica suddenly asked her, ""What do you think?""

""What?""

""Oh, sorry, I forgot you don't speak German anymore,"" Veronica apologized, turning to explain to the others, ""Ms. Belton never learned a foreign language, so don't mind her.""

A few light laughs rang out around, like tiny silver needles, poking into Gretchen's skin.

""It's okay, just take your time,"" Veronica patted Gretchen's hand, speaking gently as if comforting a child with special needs.

Gretchen looked down, her nails digging deep into the palm of her hand.

In the eyes of others, either mocking or pitying, she felt like a clown stripped naked for all to see, every breath like swallowing shards of glass.",1,1751610409.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1lrbmmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lrbmmi/ur_the_garden/,[UR] : The Garden,"**AUTHOR'S HELLO**

Long time lurker, first time poster. This is my fist attempt at writing something longer than I am used to. 

**AUSTIN**

The rain had already dried by the time he stepped out of the municipal building. The pavement shimmered with the last memory of water, but the Texas sun erased it fast, leaving only heat and the dull weight of a thousand unresolved tasks.

**MC** didn’t carry much. A black office backpack with a laptop, two books, and a folder of printed emails. The books were dog-eared: *The Death and Life of Great American Cities* and a spiral-bound volume titled simply *ERCOT Fundamentals*. He looked down at them with a kind of contemptuous affection.

Austin had been good to him, once. The city had felt like a place where things could still happen. New money, old charm, an undercurrent of energy and invention.

But that was before.

Before he trusted the wrong man.

His goal had been simple in spirit: to get the city limited authority to island and re-energise microgrids for emergency services during outages, without needing state-level utility coordination.

The project was first floated shortly after the 2021 blackout, when a brutal cold snap knocked out power across Texas. Hospitals went dark. Fire stations lost heat. Seniors froze in public housing. It became clear that waiting for top-down control wasn’t just inefficient, it was lethal.

But when the reform was proposed, jurisdictional turf wars ignited instantly which quickly stifled any momentum. Officially the project was still a work-in-progress but in reality, it had long been quietly killed.

Getting the approval to restart conversations from up the road proved more difficult than he thought, which led him to bring in a ‘fixer’. A man with charisma, connections, and a reputation for “getting things done.”

He remembered how it started. The fixer knew a councilwoman's brother, he smoothed the edges with the local Lineworkers’ union, greased small-time developers with promises of opportunity.

But he wanted more.

The man began carving private deals. Pushing agendas. Redrawing boundaries. Selling access that was out of scope. By the time **MC** noticed, half the plan was compromised. A reporter found the money trail. A whisper turned into a story. The fixer ended up burned. And the project went up in flames with him.

…

**MC**’s boss, a tall, quiet bureaucrat named Marcus Reed, called him into his office without ceremony. Just two chairs and a fan humming in the window. No threats, no accusations. Just one long look.

“You didn’t know?”

“Not until it was too late.”

“You vouched for him.”

“I did.”

**MC** stared down at his hands.

Marcus didn’t speak for a while. Then, quieter:

“People can be capable but not trustworthy. Trustworthy but not capable”

“Most are neither capable or trustworthy, the rare few are both”

“The trick is knowing who is what, before it costs you.”

He tapped a pen against the armrest.

“That’s the real skill you need in this line of work. The ability to read people.”

**MC** said nothing. He knew it wasn’t a rebuke. It was a lesson.

Marcus sat back. “They’ll eat you if you stay.”

Marcus reached into a drawer and handed him an envelope. Inside: a folded letter of recommendation and a business card with a Los Angeles address.

“You made a mistake. Don’t make the same mistake here.”

He left at dawn three days later. No farewell party. No scandal. Just a quiet resignation and a few loose ends tied up in silence. His name never made the news. Reed made sure of that.

He arrived in Los Angeles with a rental car, an empty newly leased apartment, and a job offer at the city’s Department of Zoning and Urban Development.

It was three weeks before he unpacked his books.

 

**LOS ANGELES**

Los Angeles moved differently. Faster, in some ways but not chaotic. Not like Austin’s anxious, puppy dog tempo.

Once considered one of America’s worst cities with rampant crime, sprawling homeless encampments, bureaucratic paralysis and a budget black hole. LA had, in recent years, entered into a quiet renaissance.

Nothing flashy. Just clean parks where there used to be tents. Permits moving. Construction happening. Problems being solved. The city hadn’t reinvented itself; it had simply begun to function.

His first day at the Department was unremarkable. A tan folder with onboarding documents. A temporary badge. A cramped cubicle with a slow desktop and a view of a parking garage. An unassuming start to his new life on the West Coast.

His new boss was a woman named Jean Navarro. Early forties, athletic frame beneath a tailored blazer, black hair with a stylish streak of grey, skin that held the glow of someone who spent weekends outdoors. When she shook his hand, he inadvertently held her gaze a moment longer than he should have, having been caught off-guard by her beauty.

She noticed.

She didn’t say anything.

Nor did she mention Austin.

“You’ll be working on the Jefferson Corridor project,” she said her voice was smooth, measured. Low enough to quiet a room without trying.

“We need eyes on parcel alignments and setback issues. They’ll test you. Don’t bluff.”

She walked off. That was it.

He liked her immediately.

…

The Jefferson Corridor turned out to be a thicket of competing interests: small landowners, neighbourhood groups, an ambitious public transit overlay. He kept his head down. He answered what he could, asked when he didn’t know, and made two allies in the first week by solving a permitting discrepancy no one else had noticed.

No one congratulated him. But three days later, a hard-bitten clerk from Records brought him a cup of coffee without a word. He understood.

There was something else. A pattern. Certain people had a kind of rhythm. They moved through the bureaucracy like it wasn’t broken. Like they knew which hallways to cut through, which battles not to pick. They weren’t in charge, but things changed when they showed up.

They knew each other.

His first invitation came two months in. A quiet Friday. Jean dropped a post-it on his desk. “Lunch, if you’re free. Spring & 7th.”

The restaurant occupied the ground floor of an unassuming modest six-story stone building. There were no signs, no awnings, no menus displayed in the window. Just a small bronze plaque beside the front door: The Garden.

Inside, the ground floor opened into a clean, modern-casual dining space. Polished stone floors. Light wood tables. Soft, indirect lighting that cast no shadows. A quiet hum of conversation, broken only by the clink of cutlery and the occasional scrape of a chair. Everything felt intentional without being curated.

Beyond a set of tall glass doors, the restaurant opened into a more relaxed outdoor seating area. A stone courtyard softened by ferns, climbing vines, and planter beds filled with rosemary and wild thyme. The tables out there were uneven, gently weathered. Bees sometimes drifted in, but no one minded.

The food was simple, fresh, and affordable. Lentil stew, grilled eggplant, woodfired pizza, flatbread with olive oil, roasted carrots, iced tea in wide glasses. Nothing was remarkable on its own. But everything was exactly what it needed to be.

What made the place stand out wasn’t the decor or the food. It was the people.

Low level bureaucrats. City workers in rolled-up sleeves. Construction foremen. Community organizers. Even a few quietly dressed men and women who looked like professors or small business owners. They didn’t talk loudly. No one was on their phone.

Jean didn’t talk much. She didn’t need to.

She entered the room with the ease of someone accustomed to being watched. Her heels barely made a sound on the stone. Every so often she would nod her head to a few familiar faces, or wave in greeting, each gesture landing sharper than anything said aloud.

She sat down elegantly at a table in the courtyard in one smooth motion, then crossed her legs and brushed a hand through her hair.

He tried not to stare.

He failed.

Halfway through the meal, noticing **MC**s silence she looked up and asked:

“The food not to your liking?”

“No,” he said. “It’s perfect.”

She didn’t smile, not exactly, but something softened in her face for a moment. Then it passed.

…

He came back to the restaurant the next week. Not invited, just curious. No one stopped him. He bumped into the young hard-bitten clerk from Records who nodded at him once, then went back to her salad.

He returned again the week after that.

Nothing about the place was official. But everyone there knew why they came.

And so did he.

 

**THE STONE GARDEN**

By spring, he was indispensable.

Not loudly. Not officially. Just in the way good work speaks for itself. His name started to appear in the footnotes of agendas. A brief nod in a project brief. A passing mention in internal emails:

*""Check with him first. He'll know.""*

The Jefferson Corridor development moved from tentative maybes to concrete site plans. Not everyone liked the result. But the process and the fact that it happened at all, was quietly attributed to him.

The Garden also became a bit of a habit. Mondays and Thursdays. Always the ground floor. Always in the courtyard if a table was available.

The ground floor was also known as the **Stone Garden**. Not in signage or speech, but in the way locals do, a nickname passed around by those most familiar.

The courtyard was stone-tiled and surrounded in greenery, the seating simple wood. It was elegant in the way good cities are, humble, weathered, and quietly tended.

He brought nothing to read. Nothing to signal status. Just himself. A man with a place to sit, and enough silence to think.

But it wasn’t just silence.

It was **pattern**.

The people who ate there changed slightly week to week, but the core types remained.

He began to recognize them: inspectors who never asked for credit, permit analysts who returned calls, developers who didn’t cut corners, civic engineers who knew where every valve and cable ran beneath the asphalt.

No hierarchy. Just a quiet current.

They didn’t talk shop, not directly. But you could tell who did real work by how they asked questions.

*“How’d that substation issue shake out?”*

*“Did they finally get sign-off from Cultural Affairs?”*

*“You know someone in Waste Management?”*

He too began to meet people.

First by nod. Then by name. Then by lunch.

One Tuesday, a plan checker from Van Nuys asked if he could take a look at a permit request stuck in limbo.

""Not your department, I know,"" she said, ""but I think you know the guy who’s holding it up.""

He did. And he made a call. Nothing forceful, just context, clarity, goodwill. The request got moving within the week.

No one said thank you, not formally. But the next time he came in, a building inspector he’d never met nodded as he passed and gestured to the empty seat beside him.

""Sit. Try the lentils,"" he said. ""They're good.""

Over time, a quiet rhythm developed. The Stone Garden became more than a dining room. It was **a sorting mechanism**. People showed up, ate, and if they returned, it meant something. Not everyone did. Some brought laptops. Some asked too many questions. Some tried too hard. They didn’t last.

But those who stayed, the ones who ate slowly, listened more than they spoke, and helped without keeping score, became, slowly, familiar.

Sometimes he’d catch eyes with someone and share a nod. A small signal:

*I’m here, you’re here, we both see it.*

That was enough.

 

**THE BRIAR ROOM**

The Jefferson project continued to advance in quiet, steady motion over the following weeks. Stakeholder meetings. Listening sessions. Site visits in borrowed folding chairs and under flickering fluorescent lights. He kept everything grounded; no promises, no slogans, just clarity and respect.

He kept working through one roadblock after another.

A disputed setback variance resolved with a single phone call to an old neighbourhood rep who still trusted someone from Jean’s team.

A traffic bottleneck untangled with a late-night sketch passed to a transportation analyst who remembered him from a lunch at The Garden.

Progress was slow, but it was progress, nevertheless.

Finally, the project reached its turning point: a revised zoning overlay was developed that preserved the historical core while allowing mixed-use density along the margins. Balanced. Modest. Elegant.

The current had shifted.

From this point, he wasn’t in the rooms where decisions were being made, not exactly, but something was moving. Meetings ran smoother. Objections softened. People who once ignored him now stopped to ask questions.

One community leader vouched for him. Another offered to host him for a site visit.

Then, after a particularly upbeat session, a tall, round-bellied man with ashy hair caught him in the hallway, grinning wide.

“Hey,” he said, clapping him on the shoulder. “I hear you’re the one behind Jefferson. That’s damn fine work, son.”

He nodded, caught off guard. There wasn’t much else to say.

The next morning, Jean appeared beside his cubicle wall and tapped once.

He turned, startled, not by the sound, but by her expression.

She looked different.

She wasn’t dressed differently, still supporting the usual blazer, sleeves cuffed, hair pulled back with quiet precision.

But something in her face had shifted. A lightness. A lift around the eyes. A smile expressed not just with the lips but her entire body, like a rose in bloom.

“Dinner tonight. My treat.”

He looked up. “Stone Garden?”

She smiled. “Upstairs.”

…

At the ground floor of The Garden, he hadn’t expected to feel underdressed, but he did. Charcoal jacket, open collar, polished shoes. Enough for most things, but not enough beside her.

Jean wore a fitted black dress, simple in cut but precise in its restraint. No jewellery but a thin gold chain. Her hair, usually tied back, was loose tonight, falling in soft waves that caught the amber light like silk thread.

He tried not to stare.

He failed, again.

She led him past the main dining room without a word to where a very non-descript elevator stood. He had never noticed before. No visible call buttons. No numbering. Just a mirror-polished brass door and a concierge who said nothing but gave a small nod when Jean arrived.

Inside, the panel surprised him: six numbered buttons, marked G through 6, each set into dark wood with worn brass rims.

The concierge stepped in, turned a key, and pressed 1 before nodding to Jean and stepping back out.

No words were exchanged. The doors closed in silence. No music, no announcements. Just a soft lift and the faint click of gears as they rose a single floor.

They stepped out onto Level One.

The contrast to the ground floor was subtle but total.

Gone were the polished stone floors and shared tables of The Stone Garden. Here, the space breathed quiet intentionality. The walls were panelled in deep cherry wood, carved faintly with trailing vines; roses and brambles curling around moulding and doorframes. The lighting was soft, amber, and indirect, coming not from above but from lamps tucked behind trellised woodwork, like lanterns hidden in an old garden at dusk.

A discreet brass plaque near the elevator read:

**The Briar Room.**

The name fit. The room was beautiful but not polished. It had edges. Each table was spaced like a conversation circle. No line. No servers in sight. Yet nothing was forgotten, and no one waited. The cutlery was simple but weighty. Glassware thin but durable. There was a kind of density to the place, not of bodies, but of meaning.

Jean led him to a circular table near the far wall, half-shaded by a lattice of ironwork where briar roses, carved from wood and painted in faded tones, climbed silently overhead.

Three others were already seated. They looked up as he arrived. A pause. Three nods. Quiet, exact, unhurried.

He nodded back. That was all. But it was enough. No introductions were necessary, as they were all people he was familiar with, other key stakeholders in the Jefferson project, whom without the project would have been stuck in bureaucratic limbo for many more years.

One was an older man with carpenter’s hands, neatly dressed. Another, a sharply dressed woman in her forties with a quiet confidence. The third, was the tall round-bellied man with ashy hair, who again greeted him with another jolly smile.

Dinner arrived in stages. No menu. A seasonal soup, bread, grilled fish, and something green and fragrant. Water with lemon. A bottle of red wine appeared after the second course.

The wine eased the conversation into a cordial, amicable rhythm. The five of them talked openly. About roads, budgets, permits, timelines. About trust. About people who never return calls, and the miracle of those who do. No theories. Just stories. Work. Friction. Progress.

The older man said, ""You know how you can tell if someone’s worth trusting? They don’t need you to ask. They just show up.""

Later, the woman added, ""We don’t keep score here. But we remember.""

Jean said almost nothing. Just silently listening.

Halfway through dessert, as the night was coming to an end, the big man once again said unburdened:

""You did good work on Jefferson. Good, clean work.""

He looked up, met his eyes. And acknowledged the praise with a modest nod. Nothing more.

…

At the end of the meal, no one toasted. No speeches. Just a quiet moment where the conversation folded inward, and everyone understood it was time to leave.

Jean stood, and so did he. She walked him to the elevator. They stood side by side in silence waiting for the door to open.

She had only had a single glass of wine, but it was enough to leave a faint rose blush on her cheeks. It softened her, warmed her already striking features.

He tried not to watch her in the mirrored panel across from them.

Tried, and failed.

When the doors opened, she finally spoke.

Her voice carried the hush of evening air. Cool, certain, and without need to explain itself

“There’s nothing formal. No club. No membership. Just a place where good work is recognized. A place that opens to those who’ve earned it.”

He nodded.

As they stepped inside, she added softly, but without ambiguity,

“You’re recognized here now.”

She paused, eyes lifting toward the floors above.

“There are other floors, you know. Six in total. Most of us will never see them all.

“They say the rooftop is called The Rose Garden. That’s where the founder stays. The man who built this place.”

He looked at her, waiting for more. but nothing came.

She stepped outside first. The air was cool, the street empty.

Before they parted, she turned once more.

“Most people spend their lives trying to be seen,” she said. “The ones who last are the ones who see.”

He didn’t reply.

He watched her walk into the night, graceful, untouchable, and committed her parting words to memory.

 

**EPILOGUE**

It wasn’t a promotion. No one used that word. But over the next few weeks, the shape of his work changed.

He wasn’t just assigned projects. He was asked his opinion. Given room to move. His inbox filled with quiet inquiries. Quick gut checks from people who didn’t waste words:

""You trust this team?""

""Would you flag this for review?""

""You hearing anything off about Parcel 19?""

He answered when he could. And when he couldn’t, he found someone who could. His name didn’t rise. It simply embedded itself, like a thread sewn tight into fabric.

Jean, too, changed. She brought him into conversations earlier. Gave him more responsibility. Trusted him with decisions that once sat firmly in her hands.

She didn’t offer praise. She didn’t need to.

She stopped by his desk more often, passing him a file, asking a question, giving a quiet nod that meant she’d already read the answer in his face.

She never lingered, always moving on with quiet precision. But the way she walked away, deliberate, composed, never rushed, caught his attention every time.

He tried not to stare.

He failed.

…

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he still mostly ate at The Stone Garden on the ground floor. Occasionally, he’d meet someone upstairs. They never acknowledged the shift. That wasn’t the point.

But over time, people changed how they greeted him. Not dramatically. A longer glance. A nod with weight behind it. A quiet deference, not out of fear or authority, but recognition.

One afternoon, a junior planner from the utilities department bumped into him at The Stone Garden.

""You’re the guy from Jefferson, right?""

He nodded.

""I’ve got something weird with a permit timeline. Might be nothing, but it feels off.""

They sat on a bench and went through it together. It was something. Not criminal, just careless. He gave the junior planner advice on how to resolve and that was that.

Two weeks later, he saw the junior planner again dining alone at The Stone Garden. When the young planner saw him walk in, they nodded once in gratitude. Nothing more.

…

It wasn’t a network. Not in the traditional sense. There was no org chart, no newsletter, no hierarchy. But if you knew where to look, the signs were there: likeminded people drawn together by quiet intent. They worked against inertia, against bad laws, petty politics, nimby obstruction and bureaucratic deadlock.

Not for credit, but to make the city a better place.

He began to understand the pattern: a problem would arise; something expensive; messy and contentious. And someone would nudge it, guide it, untangle it. Not for glory. Not even for thanks. Just to keep things moving.

Every so often, he’d hear about other cities.

Not directly. Just rumours. Chicago, where something similar had briefly bloomed, only to collapse in on itself under ego. A whisper of a group in Cincinnati that worked for a while, until someone tried to codify it and bring it out into the open. And finally, San Diego, where the whole thing was swallowed by scandal and never recovered.

Los Angeles was the exception, Los Angeles endured, in part thanks to the rumoured enigmatic founder and his ability to gather people who were capable and trustworthy.

He never heard the network’s founders name directly. Just stories. A man who built The Garden. The man who watered and tendered to the flowers, so that they could bloom. A gentle man who just wanted to save the city he loved. A man who never raised his voice. Who never explained. Who never promoted. He never appeared. But he was felt.

The Rose Room was mentioned in passing. A rooftop space few had seen, and fewer spoke of. It was something of a legend on the first two floors of The Garden. No pictures. No floor plans. No access code. Someone said it was covered in roses the founder had cultivated himself. Others claimed it was a mausoleum for his dead wife. Those who knew never spoke. The rest could only imagine.

He never asked about it.

…

Months passed. Projects moved. People came and went.

Then one evening, walking back from a neighbourhood site visit, he passed a side street he didn’t usually take.

A woman in a reflective vest sat on the curb, jacket half-off, sorting permit copies under torchlight. Her team was long gone.

He sat next to her. Offered water. She laughed and accepted.

They talked. About inspections. About deadlines. About how the worst thing in city work wasn’t inefficiency, it was indifference.

He asked what she did.

She just said, ""I just do what I can.""

He smiled. ""that’s more than most.""

They finished the water. He helped her gather her things.

At the next day’s meeting, she was in the back row. He saw her and nodded once in acknowledgement. No more.

1lrbmbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stoploop/comments/1lrbmbm/there_is_a_way_out/,There is a way out.,"First will still come? The Reddit Reddit diary has died, he requested me to request to post, instead of just posting, therefore, I start posting just on my own ready page, but somehow, there were people who read by personal page, anyway.

Just finished conference, I was feeling a breeze of ease, I met my photo J downstairs, he was getting coffee, had a short chat with him; actually, I meant two or five apologies during lunch, I was talking to them, they seem to be doing well, everyone it's too busy going well; X pro bath I have a student now, helping me with my work, I talk to her, And guided her, somehow, it was okay, I enjoy sharing my experience, I generally enjoy sharing my experience with the younger generation.;

I guess this is this can be a way to work, instead of instead of burying myself in paperwork. Anyway,

As I am walking home, I still feel the back lingering. This morning, I feel so tired, after last night release, then I could all wake up, early, as I had intended. I intended to do yoga, in the morning, half of the serious, in the morning, and then, complete the other half of a serious, at night.

My mine seem to be healing. My as my body heals, my mind relaxes accordingly.

Remember when I said to myself, in one previous post. That I should relax into yoga, as much as I can. No, I did not say that; I should distress myself as much as I can, and then let my body flow into work, into life, and just leave is into whatever where life may bring me. That was my epiphany I guess, my understanding,;

Repeat for emphasis, I have been I have been in this cycle of SIT, escape, avoidance. It has not been surfing very well, stress has been acclimating, it is showing in my body pains. It is quite difficult, for me, to concentrate, while the body is aching. I'm must learn to relax. I chose to go back home early, because, after conference and lunch, I could no longer concentrate on doing the next case. I have 15 minutes, but I did not choose to start an other case. I guess there was still no urgent deadlines, although, in general, I am Accumulating that, especially as my wife forces me to apply to private school for my kids, this will always be my downfall. Over ztore spending would always be my downfall; I am so tired, so fucking tired, of entertaining my wife's irrational desires, she just spends, She is just spend, with her looking at the reality of what we can afford.

Yesterday, I had a brief moment, thinking I should not pay my wife; perhaps he was asking my son to do some sort of exercise, something like that, I thought she told my love she had a lot of she put a lot of mind she put her off she has a lot she cares about our son a lot, and is genuinely already doing the best that she can unsent. Perhaps I don't want this; perhaps this privileged school day our children is already in, I don't want this, I never wanted to push our kiss academically, at least not to this level; I think she's all stressing, unnecessarily, and I don't like this life, I want just want my escape, I just want to leave her, if I could, I would have already left her, Even the temporary release we experienced last night, it was insufficient, it was too little, too late, and, comparing to the and you life pressure we were experiencing, due to her unrealistic expectations as to life, I is perfect, it's never worth it anymore.

I, being my true self, still want to escape, every day, a few minute, F a ready post that are written in and refined by AI, FE single working moment, I am still burden by this, my wife's irrational desires. I feel so tired, I want to rest, but cats, Because I have to drag my tired body to work, to settle the decks, to check on another case, again. I feel, my life, my energy, is slipping away from me. I feel that I am carrying a bit, too heavy for me to carry, and this is going to leave a mark on my body and onto my psyche, I feel that this is the end of my life, the life is generally slow slowly, slipping away from me, taken on too much, I have foolishly signed my life away, I sign in the marriage contract, antithesis just the end for me.

 I again, remind myself, I should not be so pessimistic. Remember, when we first got married, I was young, I was relatively more capable of making doing a process, I could run from the office to home or I could. If I, I had to time travel, and go back to Kathy time, when my son was just born; it was a hard time. My wife was screaming come from the post stress. Swimming all the time, non-stop. I was crying, I listened to: my I will survive: and I was Wai to leave her, I said a hard time? Actually, it was not as hard as I believed it to be.

Minimalist interiors are all about simplicity, clean lines, and intentional design choices. Every element in the space needs to serve a purpose, both visually and functionally. That’s why [light oak laminate flooring](https://onestopflooring.co.uk/collections/light-grey-oak-laminate-flooring) has become a go to option for modern living rooms that embrace a pared back, calming aesthetic.

With its soft wood tones and clean finish, light oak laminate not only complements minimalist decor but enhances it. Here’s how to make it work in your living room and why it’s such a practical and stylish choice.

# Why Choose Light Oak for a Minimalist Living Room?

Light oak brings a sense of openness and warmth to a space without overwhelming it. Its neutral tone helps reflect natural light, making rooms feel larger and brighter, perfect for the serene, uncluttered atmosphere that minimalism is known for.

**Key visual benefits:**

* Soft, pale hues that pair well with white, grey, beige, and black  
* Subtle wood grain patterns that add interest without distraction  
* A seamless flow that unifies the space without competing with furniture or wall colour  

Minimalist interiors often rely on repetition and continuity, and light oak flooring provides a perfect visual anchor for that approach.

# The Practical Advantages of Laminate in Living Rooms

While real wood is beautiful, laminate offers many of the same visual benefits at a lower cost and with easier upkeep. In high use spaces like living rooms, this makes a big difference.

**Why laminate works well in minimalist settings:**

* **Scratch and wear resistance**: Holds up against foot traffic, furniture movement, and pets  
* **Easy to clean**: A quick sweep or mop keeps it looking fresh  
* **Moisture resistance**: Better suited for daily spills and damp conditions than traditional wood  
* **Simple installation**: Click lock systems make fitting fast and straightforward  

For households that want a minimalist look without the stress of maintaining real wood, laminate offers the ideal balance.

# Styling Tips: Layering with Light Oak Laminate

In minimalist design, layering is key to keeping a space from feeling too stark. Here’s how to use your light oak laminate flooring as a base and build from there.

# 1. Monochrome and Neutral Palettes

Pair your light oak flooring with white or off white walls, grey sofas, and natural fabrics like linen or cotton. This keeps the space cohesive and calm.

# 2. Textured Soft Furnishings

Use rugs, throws, and cushions in soft wools or weaves to add depth without visual clutter. A neutral area rug on light oak flooring helps define the space while softening it.

# 3. Minimalist Furniture

Opt for furniture with clean lines and light or natural finishes. Floating shelves, low profile seating, and slim coffee tables all help maintain an open feel.

# 4. Natural Light and Simple Window Treatments

Let the flooring reflect as much natural light as possible. Choose simple blinds or sheer curtains that don’t block sunlight or visual space.

# 5. Greenery and Minimal Accessories

One or two well placed plants or ceramic vases can add warmth and texture without overwhelming the clean look.

# Room Flow and Zoning

Light oak laminate is also ideal for **open plan living rooms** where you want to create zones without using walls or bulky dividers. The consistent tone of the flooring allows the eye to travel smoothly across the space, making the room feel larger and more cohesive.

Use area rugs or changes in furniture layout to create distinct zones for lounging, reading, or working from home, all while maintaining the minimalist style.

# On the whole

Light oak laminate flooring is more than just a practical surface, it's a foundation for creating minimalist interiors that feel calm, spacious, and considered. With its natural look, ease of care, and ability to blend seamlessly into neutral decor schemes, it supports a living room design that prioritises both function and elegance.

If you’re planning a minimalist makeover, this flooring choice is one that will serve your space beautifully for years to come.
