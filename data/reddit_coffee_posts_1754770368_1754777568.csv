Meanwhile, I'm booking 40%+ response rates by watching for these specific buyer signals and timing my outreach perfectly.

These aren't theory, each template has personally closed deals for me.

Here's what actually works:

**The High-Intent Scenarios :**

1. Competitor Engagement¬†Signal:¬†Prospect liked/commented on competitor's post

Subject: Saw your take on \[Competitor's topic\]

Hi \[Name\],

Noticed you engaged with \[Competitor\]'s post about \[topic\].

We help \[their company type\] achieve \[specific outcome\] through \[your differentiator\] instead of \[competitor's approach\].

Best,  
\[Your name\]

2. New Role Alert¬†Signal:¬†Just started as Head of \[Department\]

Subject: Your new role at \[Company\]

Hi \[Name\],

Why this works:

You're reaching out when they're already thinking about the problem.

Everything is contextual with low-pressure asks.

How I track these signals:

Started manually: LinkedIn alerts, competitor monitoring, news tracking

Now automated with my own tool (but manual still works if budget's tight)

The results:¬†40-60% response rates vs. 2-5% for cold outreach.

I'm 35, single, woman, no human kids (2 dogs). Currently in Austin, TX for the past 10 years. My favorite things about this city have been the people vibes, fitness, progressive/liberal politics, food, and constant sunshine. My least favorite: living in such a red state, the unbearable hot summers (I HATE being hot), and despite being close to trails and hikes it's too dry and lacking lush greenery + it's extremely over-crowded on hikes and in the city in general.

I want to be able to hike or go put my feet in a natural body of water after work. I want summers that don't leave me miserable from the heat. I miss having four seasons. I want a sense of community and connection with like-minded people.

  
Musts:

\-Easy access to greener/more lush nature

\-Less brutal heat in the summer + four seasons + not too gloomy/gray in winter (so PNW is out) and can't handle extra harsh winters

\-Liberal/progressive town 

\-No crazy nightlife or city vibes as I prefer quieter and calmer crowds

\-Walkable neighborhoods to coffee shops or markets, but I still want to have a car

Added bonus:

\-Pottery/ceramics studio community options and artsy scene

\-Great gym and fitness scene

\-Good variety of food

i read his words knowing he thinks the breakup was clean. knowing he believes i walked away without any bitterness. in his head there is nothing standing in the way of us trying again.

but there is. and it is the one thing i will never give him the satisfaction of talking about.

1mm1h9d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mm1h9d,First time trying shading,"Hi guys,

It's my first time trying to shade and experiment which went quite horrible. Also wanted to see if the different markers would bleed / or stain when I used water / indian ink and now I know that is nothing to worry about.

I'm just starting out and thought I should choose an easier design as a cross to practice a bit and try variations.

  
What I think I did wrong is;

\- Coffee staining before the shading.  
\- Also I used cheaper paper 190gram not Arches 300gram paper as recommended.  
\- Not spit shading but using water, which was harder to get the right amount.

  
Can you guys confirm I did this wrong? Or tell me what you think I did wrong? Or any feedback/tips that would be great as well... also If the designs suck you can tell me. I think I can do the typography better so I will work on that for sure.

I made sure he knew i was the reason he got hired since i manage to put in a good word for him. i got to see liam a few times, so i asked him to have lunch with me during breaks. Liam was always kind to me. He‚Äôd say hello every day, he smiled a lot, and got me coffee

also You know those work husband and wife stories? I started to fantasize that kind of relationship with him. Eventually, I realized i developed feelings for him. so one day, I gathered up my courage and asked him out on a date.

He however in the most polite way fuc\*ing turned me down, so i couldn't even be mad. Turns out, he was already in a relationship already for roughly a year or 2 so nothing serious. But based on what I could see and the kindness he showed me all the time I could tell he really wanted to be with me. heres where i might be the AH

instead of giving up i started to text him more often especially during hours i expected him to be at home, usually bordeline flirting I also gave him compliments at work. I made sure he felt confident thanks to me , it worked since he would always smile back. I‚Äôd even lightly spray my perfume near his desk when he wasn‚Äôt there so he‚Äôd think about me when he got back.

But I didn‚Äôt stop there at a work event, liam brought his girlfriend and from what I could see I didn‚Äôt think his partner was a good fit for him. After a long night of dancing and drinking Liam being liam offered to drive a few of us home since lots of people were drinking, except him since he had to drive his girlfriend home. I took him up on the offer and chose to sit behind the passenger seat. truth be told she looked tense or weird towards me the whole night but now in the car especially more. since i was the last one he dropped off i got a good idea since i was wearing a dress i quietly removed a piece of my clothing (yes that one) and slid it under the seat where his girlfriend was sitting.

About 3 days later, Liam didn't show up to work and when he finally did he honestly looked down Sad, even. Between the flirty texts, and what she probably found in his car. i can only assume my plan worked so after confirming with him I realized It was my turn. i brought him cooked food. I complimented his work constantly. I told him how great he was and well he seemed closer to me, i even took him shopping. one day out of nowhere he asked me if i was still interested in going on a date with him, i said yes. as of today we are still together but recently he's been down and on his phone i caught him stalking his ex now im just here feeling guilty I know it‚Äôs messy.

1mm1ej8,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1mm1ej8/anyone_else_have_a_hoarder_mother_that_gave_you/,Anyone else have a hoarder mother that gave you lots of useless junk 'gifts'?,"This is both a question and a rant.

My Mother is both a hoarder (on her own and my behalf growing up) and a shopping addict. She's particularly enamored now by sites like Temu, where she can buy more cheap, unnecessary garbage than she'll ever use.

She always spent a huge amount on Birthdays and Christmas, but I came to dread them growing up because gifts were always about what made her feel good to give and were never about what I'd actually like.

I'd get vast quantities of poor quality stuff I didn't want, would never use and would never be allowed to get rid of. She never left the house and would notice whenever I'd try to give away or get rid of something, and yet criticise and mock me in front of others for being a hoarder when my room filled up with stuff I didn't want. I finally escaped last year, my place is almost bare and hers has substantially gotten more filthy and cluttered with her impulse purchases that she pretends aren't happening and leaving her broke all the time.

She can't blame me for the mess now at least, not that she doesn't try to pass the fault off and onto everyone else.

I'd have to grit my teeth and do my best to put on a big show about how much I loved her presents growing up when I was actually disappointed, despairing and knew with a sinking gut it was more overflowing clutter she'd make me hold onto that would impair my already diminished focus thanks to her abuse and make my living environment more miserable. If I didn't she'd throw a fit and would call me ungrateful, throw a colossal guilt-trip and tantrum and storm off so that'd I'd have to apologise and coax her out of, even if it was my fucking birthday. 

She seemed aversive to buying me anything I'd actually like for some reason, especially if I'd actually asked for it or indicated I might like it. If she did get me something I'd asked for it was like she'd put her own twist on it so it was impractical, burdensome and ugly.

One year I didn't ask for much but a grey desk mat, and even looked online and found the cheapest option for her. She went online and found one that was somehow even cheaper, too small, in a garish butterfly design she knew I would vehemently dislike because I didn't like feminine things while she got her and my brother who hadn't asked for them nice designs in the right size.

I got an iced coffee machine I think the same year. I don't drink or even like iced coffee, I have never shown evidence to the contrary. She was the only one that used it.

I liked digital art, gaming and books growing up. I would have melted with happiness if she'd gotten me something I'd actually wanted or asked for. I always seemed to get a lot of drugstore makeup kits that she knew I wouldn't wear because I hated makeup. I couldn't understand why she liked wasting her money when if she wanted to do something nice for me there was plenty of still-cheap items I would have been over the moon to actually receive. I didn't realize the true dynamic for a long time, let others gaslight me out of recognizing her covert malice in other dimensions of the relationship, just felt so unseen.

She always told me I never went without growing up and acted like I was spoiled rotten. Making out to others how I was so expensive and drained all her finances, them always somehow failing to notice all the clothes and nice things for herself that cropped up while I went walking around in a middle-aged woman's stained and/or unwanted hand-me-downs. I remember holes tearing through the bottom of my school bag more than once because of the weight and because she kept buying me the cheapest options she could get her hands on. Walking around for a week at school with half my foot hanging out the hole of my shoes, how when I'd get new ones half the time they'd be so tight they'd hurt and I couldn't wear them, her bagging on me about it like I was just being fussy. I looked homeless and even the teachers treated me like a pariah in highschool, I don't need think I need to state.

It was so isolating because I got ""so much"" that whenever I showed I was the slightest bit unhappy people would seem to get this envious glint in their eyes and pounce to call or dismiss me for being ungrateful, even now it doesn't seem to compute with people that the gifts are and always have been devoid of thought or care or love (just like her!). They exist so she gets to have fun shopping and gets to look and feel good about herself for being 'generous'. 

They were burdens! Living surrounded by overflowing junk you can't use or diminish, while the things you actually need aren't ever acquired (or you're delayed in getting by months) is actually horrible.

I tried being self-sufficient growing up but that's another can of worms. Guess who would intentionally sabotage my interviews and would offer me money for chores yet never pay? Guess who would borrow Birthday/Christmas gift money for half a year or more? Who would borrow smaller sums and try to wheedle out of it while you she got benefits that were supposed to be to support you and you had no consistent source of money?

The main reason for doing so is stated to be for survival, since humans have become more technologically advanced and would hunt the vampires down because they wouldn't tolerate being preyed upon.

True Blood follows a similar premise, where the titular blood substitute causes vampires to come out in the open because they are able to try living in peace with humans, having no longer any need to prey upon them (from what I remember).

But in a setting where humans have become aware of the existence of vampires, or for that matter a sapient species that feed parasitically on humans for sustenance, is the only way the two sides could find ""peace"" if there's a substitute for the substance the vampires need?

I'm imagining a setting like Vampire: The Masquerade where finding an alternative to blood would fundamentally break the lore, because vampirism is a divine curse or because the reason vampires need a certain substance from human bodies is mystical and can't be re-created.

For example, what vampires need is human life-force found within the blood, and while animal blood could sustain them, living on it for too long will make them more animalistic and lose higher mental functioning.

And while very different from traditional depictions of vampires, I've got a setting where ""demons"" are beings from another dimension that are basically ""emotion vampires"". In their true forms they are blobs of black goo, but by feeding on human emotions they gain the ability to shape-shift by compressing their bodies into any form they want.

Demons reproduce in a process similar to mitosis, where they split a part of them which will grow into another demon, but they are born non-sapient. Only after feeding on human emotions can they gain self-awareness and something like a personality piece by piece. And to maintain their identity and sapience they need to continue feeding on emotion.

Even though demons feed on something abstract, they can still be just as dangerous as ""traditional"" vampires when they feed, having the capability to drain humans into emotionless husks if they aren't careful. **And because of the abstract nature of what they feed on, creating a ""substitute"" is difficult to say the least.**

Do vampires and other human parasites like my demons need to find a substitute in order to have any hope of surviving without being hunted down if humans are aware of them, and would peaceful coexistence be possible without it?",2,1754776257.0,worldbuilding,4,0.75,False

I was halfway through reheating yesterday‚Äôs coffee in the microwave when I noticed my phone buzzing with another email about a bill I forgot. My dogs had just knocked over an organized pile of papers I had left on the floor temporarily. There was a half-folded pile of laundry in the corner. For some reason, I just sat down in the middle of all that chaos‚Äîright there on the floor‚Äîand muttered, ‚ÄúLord, I‚Äôm tapped out.‚Äù Not even looking up, not even trying to be reverent. But something about saying it out loud cracked the tension in my chest.

I think that‚Äôs why daily prayer matters more than we realize. It‚Äôs not because it makes us polished Christians or earns us some invisible gold star. It‚Äôs because it *interrupts* us. It breaks through the hamster wheel in our head and reminds us there‚Äôs Someone else in the room who isn‚Äôt panicking.

Why Daily Prayer Matters

If I‚Äôm honest, I used to think prayer was just a warm-up before ‚Äúreal‚Äù spiritual work‚Äîlike Bible study or serving. But now I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs the oxygen tank for all the other stuff. Without it, I can read a chapter and still feel empty, or serve all day and still snap at my family. Prayer is where the connection happens, where the static clears.

And no, I don‚Äôt manage to pray every morning at the same time with a candle lit and journal open. Some days, my prayer is a rushed whisper while the toast burns. Other days, it‚Äôs an unexpected pause at a red light when I realize I‚Äôve been clenching my jaw for an hour straight (LOL). But those moments‚Äîmessy and short‚Äîare the ones that pull me back into God‚Äôs presence.

# What Is Prayer, Really?

We like to make it fancy, but prayer is basically talking to God like you would to your best friend‚Äîexcept you can skip the small talk. Sure, you can praise Him, confess, thank, and ask for help. But sometimes, I just complain (not often, but I admit it does slip out). Sometimes I sit in silence because I have no idea what to say. And somehow all that counts too because He loves when we just spend time in His presence.

I once heard a pastor describe prayer as ‚Äúleaning your whole weight on God.‚Äù That stuck with me. It‚Äôs less about the right words and more about where you‚Äôre leaning when you don‚Äôt have the strength to stand on your own.

# A Simple Structure That Centers Us

When my brain feels like a cluttered garage, I fall back on a loose rhythm:

* Praise: Even if it‚Äôs just, ‚ÄúGod, thank You for letting me wake up again.‚Äù
* Confession: Not a dramatic confession booth moment, just telling Him where I blew it.
* Thanks: Even for the weird stuff, like the fact my neighbor mowed part of my lawn by accident.
* Ask: The part where I finally admit I need help with the thing I‚Äôve been pretending I can handle.

It‚Äôs not elegant. Half the time, I forget a step. But it‚Äôs a place to start when my head is noisy.

# Real-Life Examples

A friend of mine, Carol, contacted me last winter in tears because her grown son wasn‚Äôt speaking to her. She said she‚Äôd been praying every night, not for him to call, but for God to give her a softer heart. Two months later, she told me they‚Äôd had lunch. She laughed through the whole story like she couldn‚Äôt believe it had happened.

Then there‚Äôs our Tuesday night Bible group, where somehow we end up talking about sports injuries or burnt casseroles before someone says, ‚ÄúWe should pray about this.‚Äù It‚Äôs never planned. But it‚Äôs in those unplanned moments‚Äîwhen prayer sneaks in sideways‚Äîthat I see God at work the most.

# Benefits You Can‚Äôt Ignore

I‚Äôm not here to give you a numbered list of scientifically proven prayer perks, but here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed:

* I don‚Äôt explode over small annoyances quite as often.
* I sleep better on nights I‚Äôve actually prayed instead of just scrolling myself to exhaustion.
* My perspective shifts‚Äînot all at once, but enough that I can see over the fog for a second. Sometimes the benefit isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeeling better‚Äù at all. Sometimes it‚Äôs simply knowing I‚Äôm not alone in the mess.

# Challenges and Tips

Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthere are days prayer feels like talking to a wall. I‚Äôve sat there wondering if I‚Äôm just listing my grocery items to the ceiling. On those days, I‚Äôll read a Psalm out loud, not because I feel holy, but because I need someone else‚Äôs words to pull me out of my own head.

Another challenge? The ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it later‚Äù trap. My fix: I stick a Post-it note on the coffee maker with the word ‚ÄúPRAY‚Äù in all caps. It‚Äôs hard to ignore when I‚Äôm half-awake and waiting for caffeine.

# Reflection and Invitation

What if prayer wasn‚Äôt something we had to gear up for, but something we just stumbled into‚Äîlike sitting on the floor with yesterday‚Äôs coffee, muttering a tired hello to God?

I‚Äôm learning daily prayer changes things, but maybe not in the neat, Instagram-ready way I used to picture. It changes me in ways I don‚Äôt always notice until later‚Äîlike realizing I didn‚Äôt panic when the bad news came, or that I answered with kindness when I was running on fumes.

So maybe start small. Whisper something honest to God today. Forget about eloquence. Let your heart speak, even if it stumbles over the words.

**Your turn**: What‚Äôs the oddest, most unexpected place you‚Äôve ever prayed? Think about it‚Äîand maybe tell someone. You might be surprised how much it matters.

**Call-to-Action**: If this stirred something in you, share it with a friend who could use a reminder that prayer doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect to be powerful.

A man walked through a busy city street, his gaze fixed on the ground. People rushed past, voices blended into a blur, but he remained disconnected, as if moving through a world not his own.

Suddenly, he stumbled into someone a stranger holding a small girl in his arms. The child was limp. The man‚Äôs face was soaked in tears as he cried out, ‚ÄúHelp! Please, someone call 911!‚Äù

But the man kept walking, unmoved.

A few blocks later, he stopped briefly at the edge of a quiet park. An old man sat alone on a bench by the lake, scattering crumbs for a pair of ducks. Then, without warning, the old man slumped forward and fell from the bench. He didn‚Äôt move again. The path was empty no one else around.

Still, the man said nothing. He did nothing. He just walked on.

Turning a corner, a sharp cry echoed from a nearby alley.

‚ÄúHelp me!‚Äù

He glanced toward the sound. A woman was struggling, being robbed her voice strained, her face contorted in fear. The man paused only a moment before continuing down the street, unaffected.

Eventually, he reached the cemetery at the city‚Äôs edge. There, a lone caretaker was lowering a coffin into a freshly dug grave. The man watched from a distance as the caretaker strained with the pulley system. Tears streamed down his face, falling like rain onto the polished wood. Then suddenly, the cord slipped both the coffin and the caretaker fell into the grave.

The man turned away.

He crossed the street just as a car sped toward the intersection. The driver, eyes glued to his phone, looked up at the last second just in time to swerve. He missed the man... but crashed into a coffee shop at the corner. Shattered glass, screams, and dust filled the air.

Still, the man didn‚Äôt flinch.

Behind him, chaos and cries echoed through the streets.

At the end of the block, he saw a child kneeling beside a motionless woman on the sidewalk her mother. The child sobbed, clinging to her still hand. The man walked past without slowing.

Further on, a police officer was caught in the middle of a heated conflict between two groups. Tension cracked someone pulled a gun. A shot rang out. The officer was hit in the throat. He fell, gasping, blood pouring from between his fingers.

People scattered in panic, leaving the officer alone.

The man passed by. Their eyes met briefly. In the officer‚Äôs final breath, all he saw in the stranger‚Äôs face was emptiness.

Sirens screamed behind him as he reached the steps of his apartment. Police cruisers sped past, lights flashing.

He opened the door and stepped inside.

And there hanging from the ceiling  a man.

Familiar. Lifeless.

The man stared in silence.

His eyes drifted to the end table.

Forget waiting hours for one load to finish. Leader‚Äôs triple-drum design is built for multi-tasking madness:  
- Main drum (10.5 kg): Handles bulky stuff like bedding and coats.  
- Two mini drums (1 kg each): Perfect for socks, undies, or even sneakers (yes, it has a shoe-washing mode!).  
- Zero cross-contamination: Each drum has its own water system, so your gym clothes won‚Äôt smell like baby onesies .  

And it‚Äôs smart AF: AI balances loads to cut noise (just 48 dB, quieter than a coffee maker!), and a UV sterilizer zaps bacteria. Plus, a 22-minute quick wash for when you‚Äôre running late .  


Leader is part of Haier, a global appliance giant known for pushing boundaries. This washer is their latest flex‚Äîengineered for lazy geniuses who want efficiency without sacrificing cleanliness.  


Price: ~$690 (4999 yuan) in China. No word yet on global availability, but we‚Äôre crossing fingers for a US/EU launch soon .  
Size: Taller than average (107 cm), so measure your laundry room first.

A few weeks ago I was at a friend's place (I'll call him James). He has a workshop people come and go from. I commute to and from work and I had just gotten off work and didn't feel like doing the hour and a half drive yet, so I stopped by for a visit. My friend has been doing a lot of vaping of weed for months now. On this day he was drinking and smoking. I do not partake. Another friend came over and was talking about family problems. They asked for my input and I guess my friend (James) didn't like my opinion and started saying things like ""WTF do you know"", ""you don't know the whole story"" and eventually ""shut the fuck up"" and ""get the fuck out"". Now I've known this guy for years, he's an old biker type, and we've gone down this road. Usually I would take offense, get my things, run out, cry...any or all of those. But now, we've gone through a lot,were older, wiser (I thought) and I wasn't going to buy in to that. So I said, no I'm not going to shut up. Don't talk to me like that. I asked him ""Why are you getting so emotional about some other guys paperwork?"" He was getting madder and practically spitting while talking - saying he wasn't emotional and I was fing stupid and what not. So again he tells me to ""Get the fuck out"" and I am thinking  I should call his bluff. I made a HUGE mistake and told him to ""Make me"". 

He (has trouble walking most of the time) rushed me, grabbed me around the throat and started choking me. After some amount of time he let my throat go and grabbed all of my hair and lifted me out of my chair. He was trying to throw me to my knees on the concrete floor. I had my laptop on my lap(I am an older college student) so I was trying to protect it from getting broken as he was dragging me to the ground. After putting it aside I was able to get away from him. The other party quickly left the building. As I was gathering my things he tried to throw a glass jar at my head but missed but successfully threw a cup of coffee at/on me. 

I've known this man for almost 10 years and have seen him get mad, often too quickly, but never personally seen him be violent like that.

And so, after some reddit research, I found myself here and am wondering if this could be caused by cannabis. 

One more incident occurred that may shed light on this subject. A week or two prior to this, same place, another friend visited him and he offered him some of this wax. The other friend took a very big hit and maybe 7 minutes or so later was sweating and turned grey. He fell on the ground and was out. I wanted to call 911 but James wouldnt let me. He said he was going to get a friend of ours and would be right back. He left and didn't come back for almost two hours. I had just stopped by but ended up caretaking after James took off. I later heard he just didn't want to be there in case something really bad happened. Which is a great point because he basically left me to deal with a situation I had no experience with. Thanks to Chatpgt I was able to work through it safely. 

I can't think of another reason that this person I know could be acting so strangely. He also seems to be getting increasingly frustrated in general. Short tempered, no patience, and more.

Overall, this hotel feels more like a Hyatt Regency or Grand.

The facilities are nice and new, but doesn't have much of a wow factor. Rooms were definitely on the larger side for London, and has an automatic toilet with bidet functionality. (9/10)

Location is fine, probably considered below average, as it's in a slightly less central area. (6/10)

Service was mixed. I didn't feel like it was particularly Park Hyatt level. Staff were average at best, no one felt particularly proactive. Especially at breakfast, staff will frequently walk around you, not clear plates, offer refills of water, or anything. Not sure if it's Hyatt or London, but it seems service culture is declining significantly at my last few London Hyatt stays this year, HR Blackfriars, Stratford, Andaz, and now here, none of the service has been particularly good and in fact, I've had quite a few major issues at those previous stays. (6/10)

Food quality was fine for a Park Hyatt. You're limited to one a la carte item, you can't even get a lot of the sides like sausages or stuff without an extra upcharge. Drink selection is basic for a Park Hyatt as well, nothing beyond standard coffees/teas. Other Park Hyatts like Jakarta, Auckland, Bangkok, etc. have matcha, chai, taro, etc. Considering the nightly rates, I feel like they should definitely have a better selection. (7/10)

All in all, I feel like they chose to brand this as Park for the higher price tags, but could've easily branded this as a Regency, Andaz, or Grand and I would've felt no difference in quality.",7,1754775608.0,hyatt,1,0.89,False

1mm1277,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mm1277/does_she_like_me/,Does she like me?,"To put it simply, I like a girl who happens to be a friend of my cousin‚Äôs. I know that when we like someone, we tend to magnify things or overthink certain situations, which is why I‚Äôd like to get neutral, unbiased opinions about it.

I‚Äôll try to keep this as short as I can. For context: my cousin, along with a big part of my family, lives in a city far away, which I visit about three or four times a year for short periods. I get along really well with my cousin, and he‚Äôs introduced me to all his friends ‚Äî including her. We‚Äôve met the last three times I visited, the most recent being about three weeks ago.

The first time we met was around Christmas, at some sort of concert. We talked and had a good time; I thought she was really cute and funny, but nothing more, since I didn‚Äôt expect to see her again (or at least not often). The second time was about three months ago. My cousin always waits for me at the train station, and she was there too. I was surprised ‚Äî she even said she was supposed to meet some friends later for a pub quiz, but instead she stayed and had dinner with us. During that visit, the three of us also met once more for coffee. The third time was, as I mentioned, about three weeks ago. Again, she came with my cousin to meet me at the station. We had dinner and went to a nice viewpoint until late at night, and had a great time. A couple of days later, we met again and went to another concert/festival. She got a bit tipsy and grabbed my arm (hugged) for a while. Finally, couple days after coming back home, she texted me and said she was sorry we couldn't meet one more time, but next times drink where on her (I paid the last round for us three).

It was during this last visit that I realized I really like her. The texting, the fact that she came along to meet me, and even cancelling a plan to spend time with us make me think she might have at least some interest in me. However, maybe I‚Äôm exaggerating. It‚Äôs true that I‚Äôve only ever met her with my cousin, so she could simply be being nice and friendly. My best friend insists it‚Äôs obvious she likes me, but I believe he is just teasing me. Next time I go there, I‚Äôd like to make a move (talk to my cousin about it as well), or at least let her know that I like her. But knowing whether she has even a bit of interest in me would make it easier. What do you think?

1mm11n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenXWomen/comments/1mm11n8/genx_only_child_have_you_made_plans_for_your/,GenX only child? - Have you made plans for your childhood home when your Baby Boomer parents pass away?,"If you are an only child and your Baby Boomer parents are aging, have you - or they - made plans for their house (your childhood home, design circa 1980s) when they pass away? Do you plan to rent the house to cover property taxes and provide passive income for yourself? Do you know already that you'll need to sell the house when one or both are gone? 

I've watched my friends struggle with jealous, angry, and/ or bitter siblings about what to do with their family home, but none of them are only children. 

Both of my parents, though aging and not in the best health, are holding their own for now. I am not sure who will pass first, but my Dad may drive my Mom to an early grave. He berates her about her mobility is declining due to increasingly severe arthritis and stress from caregiving for him (a stroke survivor and current cancer patient), full-time. Neither will accept services from home health aides. When one or both pass, everything will fall to me to manage.

My parents went through a rough patch 25 years ago and they were passive aggressive angry with each other. I was long gone out of the house. The way they expressed themselves was by skipping home maintenance. It was such a shock. When I was a child, being house-proud was a major thing. Spending Sunday afternoons at the hardware store for home project supplies was as routine as making a fresh pot of coffee in the morning. 

The home improvements that should have been happening regularly then, didn't. They are now happening frequently because Dad can't be ""Mr. Patch Fix-It"" and the house is aging like they are. Now, something that was deferred maintenance gets fixed for urgent reasons every 5 -6 months.

If you're an only child, please share your thoughts. Thanks!

TL;DR: Only child with elderly parents? Do you have plans for your childhood home when your parents pass away? Keep and rent the house, as is? Sell because you'll need to sell it? It's complicated because the interior is like a time capsule, circa 1980s. Both parents are in declining health and now dealing with home maintenance alongside their respective health issues.",5,1754775513.0,GenXWomen,8,1.0,False

# Wet N Wild Matte Liquid Lipstick: Best of 2025? review

The Wet N wild Matte Liquid Lipstick has become a staple in many makeup enthusiasts' collections, lauded for its affordability and notable color payoff. As we look ahead to 2025, it's crucial to examine whether this budget-friendly option still holds its own against newer and perhaps more innovative formulas on the market. This review dives deep into its key features, benefits, compares it to competitors, and ultimately, determines if it deserves a spot in your makeup bag for the coming year.

## Key Features Analysis

The Wet N Wild Matte Liquid Lipstick boasts several key features that contribute to its overall appeal and performance,impacting its standing in the competitive beauty landscape.

**Highly Pigmented Formula:**

One Of The Most Prominent features of the wet N Wild Matte Liquid Lipstick is its intense color payoff. With just one swipe,most shades deliver full opacity,minimizing the need for multiple layers and reducing the chances of a cakey or uncomfortable feel. This high pigmentation contributes to its popularity, particularly among those seeking bold and vibrant lip looks without breaking the bank.

**Long-Lasting Wear:**

Wet N Wild Claims that this liquid lipstick offers long-lasting wear, designed to stay put for several hours without notable fading or transfer. While individual experiences may vary depending on eating habits and request techniques, many users report that the lipstick maintains its color intensity for a respectable amount of time, reducing the need for frequent touch-ups throughout the day.

**Matte finish:**

As the name suggests, this lipstick sets to a completely matte finish. Gone is the shine, and in is a flat colour across your lips for hours on end. The lack of shine contributes to its modern look, and the rapid-drying technology used ensures the lipstick can set and forget. No more worrying about transfer when sipping on your coffee.

**Affordable Price Point:**

Perhaps the most recognizable and defining feature of this product is its extremely accessible price point. Wet N Wild is renowned for its budget-friendly offerings, and its matte liquid lipstick is no exception. This affordability makes it an attractive option for makeup beginners, students, or anyone looking to expand their lipstick collection without spending a fortune. It also lowers the risk associated with experimenting with new shades or formulas.

**Variety of Shades:**

Wet N Wild Offers a wide array of shades, ranging from classic nudes and reds to trendy purples and browns. This extensive color selection caters to diverse skin tones and preferences, allowing consumers to find the perfect shade for any occasion. The brand also frequently releases limited-edition collections, ensuring a continuous stream of options to choose from.

Key features of the Wet N Wild Matte Liquid Lipstick include:

* Intense pigmentation
* Long-wearing formula
* Matte finish
* Highly affordable price
* Extensive shade range.

## Core Benefits

The Wet N Wild Matte Liquid Lipstick provides several practical benefits that contribute to its appeal among consumers seeking an affordable and reliable lip product.

**Confidence Boosting Color:** The variety of shades available ensures that users can find colours that suit their skin tones perfectly. This helps with creating a look that makes them feel confident on dates or days when they could be using more confidence. A bad lipstick can make you feel dreadful, and so finding the right shades goes a long way.

**Easy And Quick Application:** The lipstick's formula glides smoothly onto the lips, allowing for easy and precise application. The doe-foot applicator is designed to distribute the colour evenly, minimizing the risk of streaks or uneven coverage. This ease of application makes it ideal for those who are new to liquid lipsticks or those with limited time for makeup application.

**Minimal Product Wastage:** Due to the high pigmentation of the formula, users generally only need one coat to achieve full colour payoff. This reduces product waste and prolongs the lifespan of the lipstick,making it an economical choice in the long run. The controlled application also minimizes the risk of smudging and improves overall precision.

**Versatile Look Creation:** Whether you're aiming for a natural, everyday look or a bold, dramatic statement, the Wet N Wild Matte Liquid Lipstick can be easily adapted to suit different makeup styles. A sheer layer can provide a subtle wash of colour, while multiple coats can create a more intense and impactful effect.This versatility makes it a valuable addition to any makeup collection.

## FAQs Section

**is the Wet N Wild Matte Liquid Lipstick cruelty-free?**

Yes,Wet N Wild is a cruelty-free brand,meaning they do not test their products on animals. This makes the lipstick a more ethical choice for consumers who prioritize animal welfare.

**how long does the lipstick typically last on the lips?**

The longevity of the lipstick can vary depending on individual factors, such as eating habits and application techniques. However,most users report that it lasts for approximately 4-6 hours before requiring a touch-up.

**Does the lipstick dry out the lips?**

Some users with dry lips may find that the matte formula can be slightly drying, especially after prolonged wear. Applying a lip balm beforehand can help to mitigate this issue.**Is the Wet N Wild Matte Liquid Lipstick transfer-proof?**

While the lipstick is designed to be long-wearing and relatively resistant to transfer, it may transfer slightly onto cups or utensils. setting the lipstick with a translucent powder can help to minimize transfer.

I decided to shift my focus to my diet, and here‚Äôs what I changed:

Short cleanse: A few days of simple, gentle meals ‚Äî fresh fruits, steamed veggies, and herbal teas.

Avoided processed foods: I cut out fried snacks, sugary beverages, and overly packaged items.

Whole-food focus: More fresh produce, nuts, seeds, and simple home cooking instead of takeout.

Better hydration: More water, less coffee and soda.

Probiotics: Added fermented foods like sauerkraut and plain yogurt into my weekly meals.

After a couple of months, I noticed two big improvements ‚Äî my digestion felt lighter, and my breakouts were far less severe. Over time, my skin became calmer and healthier.

Here are our favorite attractions/locations + tips:

Tokyo:

* We stayed in Otsuka. It was cheap, quiet, and on the Yamanote Line‚Äîhighly recommend.
* For quick breakfast + coffee we always go for Tully's. Its always easy to find a seat there(which is rare for Tokyo) and prices are cheap. 
* Tennozu Isle is great if you‚Äôre into art. Pigment, an art supplies store, was one of the highlights of our trip. There are also some nice coffee shops and restaurants along the harbor with relaxing views. We were lucky enough to catch an exhibition of local artists‚Äô work, which was a wonderful experience.
* Marunouchi was great for casual walks in the mornings especially the area between Tokyo Station and Imperial Palace. For Imperial Palace, we didnt want to wait the line for the main enterance, we just walked around it and explore the outer gardens via Hirakawa Gate(i hope its the correct name). 
* Daikanyama area is nice and quiet with the path among the river . We loved the Starbucks Reserve and also T-Site
* Ginza was overall very expensive but visiting Itoya and Uniqlo definitely worth it. Just make sure to go there very early. Among all the stationary shops we visited Itoya was by far the best. 
* Shinjuku Gyoen is huge but worth to visit. 
* The places/areas we didnt like: Shibuya(too crowded), Tokyo Skytree(too crowded), Akihabara(not into electronics/anime), Kanda(we like bookstores but the ones on Daikanyama and Ginza were better

Kyoto:

* Stayed at Prince Hotel Takaragaike. Probably the best hotel i have ever stayed in. The area is magical and the hotel is very comfortable quiet and cheap(it was around 140 USD/night)
* Takaragaike Lake was great, definitely will go again.
* Kyoto Botanical Garden is a must if you are into plants/nature
* Walking along Kamo River was great
* Day trip to Osaka just to see the Aquarium. Worth it. 

We are already planning to visit again this October/November! It will be nice to hear out your recommendations. ",3,1754774735.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

Here‚Äôs the thing: I actually want to go solo. My vision for this trip has always been just me, the trek, and the mountains, no group dynamics, no familiar faces, just a pure, personal experience. But because of these rules, I need a second person on paper to make it happen.

I DON‚ÄôT CARE ABOUT AGE OR GENDER. I just need someone who‚Äôs planning to trek around the same time so we can be ‚Äúpermit partners.‚Äù Beyond that, we can walk together, separately, or just meet when needed, totally flexible.

# WATCH NFL LIVE STREAM

With the advent of internet streaming, it‚Äôs made cable a pretty outdated service. Unfortunately, there isn‚Äôt really a good place to watch sports online. I‚Äôve tried purchasing a streaming service that gives you access to NFL games, but I was also paying for a bunch of channels I never even watched. Talk about a waste of money!

But what if I told you I found a place to watch an NFL live game without cable?

Awesome, right?¬†

I found this awesome place that streams all NFL games online for free. And I didn‚Äôt even have to sign up!

If you‚Äôve tried to watch NFL games online before, you probably know that the NFL has some pretty strict streaming regulations. They typically want people to watch on TV. But right when I was about to give up and accept their demands, I found this great streaming service.¬†

It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren‚Äôt even in my region. It‚Äôs practically heaven on Earth!

But let‚Äôs delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?

I have access to every NFL game everywhere

Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don‚Äôt give you access to all the available games? Crazy right?¬†

Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn‚Äôt even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.

One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?

I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like.¬†

Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I‚Äôm getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.

I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free.¬†

Which channels do I have access to?

You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn‚Äôt the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn‚Äôt on one of the channels, I can see that, too!

But what about the video quality?

It doesn‚Äôt do you any good to have access to all these games if you can‚Äôt see anything, right?

Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your internet can handle it, anyway. But don‚Äôt worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I‚Äôve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn‚Äôt have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!

After all, what‚Äôs the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything‚Äôs buffering all the time.

In the end,

I finally don‚Äôt have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn‚Äôt have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!

This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn‚Äôt be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I‚Äôve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch.¬†

And if you use this service, you can too.

Regarding the pot: Probably need a 4-cup version to be able to make for a few people, but not more than that. 2-cup version may be ok as well. I like the Brikka, because I've been told that's closest to espresso, but I don't know if it comes in 4-cup size? Maybe I should just get the 2-cup version.

My question is mostly about the stove top though, I don't have any idea what to go with. Electric would be ideal, probably don't want to deal with the gas. ",2,1754774646.0,mokapot,7,1.0,False

The first thing I was greeted by on my return to consciousness was a horrific crunching, slurping, squelching cacophony emanating from a few inches in front of me. Next came the smells: blood, sweat, stale coffee, and old cigarette smoke. I gradually became aware of the fact that I was slumped on the floor against a wall and that the sounds, unfortunately, were not just a side effect of head trauma on passing out. Snaps of breaking bones reverberated through my spine.

I decided there was no fucking way I was going to open my eyes with that shit going on. Whatever it was, it wasn‚Äôt happening to me and I definitely didn‚Äôt want to bear witness to the nightmare fuel that seemed to be occurring.

It took aeons for the sounds to finally stop in a satisfied *SLUUUUURP*.

After giving it a few more seconds I finally winked open one eye.

Charlie‚Äôs blood-spattered office greeted my horrified eyes. Everything came rushing back in an instant. Beating him with his mug. Stabbing him with the letter opener. *Holy shit,* *I am so fucked.*

Where was the body?

I frantically got to my feet, slipping in the garishly large pool of blood on the floor. The body was gone.

*What the fuck?*

Insistent tapping came from outside the window. There she was; the mantis. Brilliant blue-green carapace flashing in the scant evening light. She was preening gracefully with her front legs; wiping red off of her beautiful, iridescent eyes. I brushed it off as a trick of the light that she seemed several inches larger than she had before. We looked at each other for several seconds as the realization dawned on me.

‚ÄúHow did you‚Ä¶. Why did you‚Ä¶ What?‚Äù

She cocked her head at my stuttering questions in apparent amusement. She tapped twice on the glass and suddenly jumped off the 13^(th) story window in the gathering darkness.

¬†

Shaking with adrenaline and covered in blood, I stumbled down to the parking garage. Flashes of Charlie played in my mind. His symphonic screams of agony. The cathartic release of feeling the letter opener push through his skin, fat, muscle; sticking beautifully into his ribs. A delicious, abhorrent appreciation for the memory mixed with an animal panic of the consequences. An all-encompassing void of glee and terror enveloped me.

I‚Äôm not sure how long I was sitting in the car outside the house. Debra pounding insistently on the window finally pulled me from my reverie.

It was fully dark now. My headlights were pointed at the living room window which was terribly confusing until I realized I was parked diagonally across the yard. I exited the car, feeling blissfully disjointed from my body, millions of miles away. Debra was anxiously saying something but I couldn‚Äôt quite make out the words. With exaggerated care, I turned and closed the car door and slowly lifted the key fob, locking the car that was suddenly covered in a series of new, ominous scratches and dents. *Did I drive home?*

Debra was in my face again. My arms feeling full of marshmallows, I pushed her aside and walked into the house, leaving my wallet and keys in the assigned bowl by the door. I leaned to untie my shoes and lay them on the mat. I stood.

Debra had never slapped me before. Her hand came out of nowhere, lightning fast and shockingly hard. I suddenly, violently, dropped back into my body.

‚ÄúDeb! What the shit!?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, now you‚Äôre talking?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy did you fucking slap me!?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe because you wrecked the car? Or because you parked it in the begonias? Or, I don‚Äôt know, maybe because you are covered. In. Fucking. Blood? You are so lucky the kids aren‚Äôt home!‚Äù Her pale cheeks flushed pink in rage. ‚ÄúWhat is going on, Steven?! I am THIS CLOSE to calling the cops right now.‚Äù Fingers in my face a scant millimeter apart.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù

Her face softened by degrees.

‚ÄúSteven, please. You are scaring me. What is going on with you?‚Äù

*I can‚Äôt tell her.*

‚ÄúPlease just tell me.‚Äù Her eyes so pleading and full of fear remind me of how she looked when she told me she was pregnant with Teddy. Tugging an errant chord in my heart.

‚ÄúI got in an argument with my boss.‚Äù

*Idiot! Why are you telling her?!*

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd.. and I hit him.‚Äù My eyes no longer meeting hers.

*You can stop talking at any time, Steven.*

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd nothing, Deb. I hit him. That‚Äôs it.‚Äù

*Granted, I hit him* a lot*.*

‚ÄúI need you to tell me the truth.‚Äù She stepped closer to me, gently setting her hand on my arm. ‚ÄúTell me the truth so I can help you. Are you in trouble?‚Äù Her voice is so much sweeter than it usually sounds, cloying like ripe blackberries. Gentle and concerned.

I paused, thinking of the massive pool of blood clotting on floor of Charlie‚Äôs office. That same blood currently sticking to my skin and clothes.

*Fuck.*

¬†I nodded haltingly.

Debra‚Äôs eyes flashed. ‚ÄúOk. Here‚Äôs what we do. I‚Äôm going to call your brother. That way we can get ahead of this, legally. You are going to get those clothes off and you are going to shower. Then we can all talk about this. Ok?‚Äù Her voice exaggerated in its calmness. Like someone talking to a panicked child.

I nodded again.

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm going to pull the car into the garage,‚Äù Deb said, taking the keys from the bowl and pulling her phone out to call my brother, Jake.

¬†

I climbed the stairs slowly like an old man, muscles aching from the exertion of massacre. I stripped in front of the washing machine and threw my clothes in, dumping a generous amount of bleach in on top of them.

Naked, I walked to the master bathroom and turned the shower on the highest heat. I stood in the growing steam, staring into the mirror idly. I could just barely make out the sound of car pulling up; a car door opening and closing. Jake must have been in the area. Or the cops have already figured it out.

Heedless to the visitor, I stepped into the shower. The water was scalding. My skin that wasn‚Äôt already red from sun burn turned a shade of lobster immediately, the water flowed rust red down the drain. Searing pain shot through my right hand. Jerking back from the water, I stared in mild surprise at the gashes cutting across my palm and pinky finger. I narrowed my eyes in disdain, realizing I must have cut myself during the‚Ä¶ incident. *Well that‚Äôs inconvenient.*

I got out of the shower and started searching the cabinets for band-aids. Empty box. *It gets bette*r. It occurred to me that the kids‚Äô bathroom would doubtless have numerous boxes of bandages.

Leaving the shower running, I moved quickly out into the hallway, carelessly leaving sodden footprints in the plush carpet and stalked towards the other bathroom. Raised voices just downstairs derailed my mission.

‚Äú‚Ä¶think he killed someone, Jake! Don‚Äôt you see? It‚Äôs like a godsend!‚Äù Debra‚Äôs voice, shrill.

‚ÄúDeb! He‚Äôll hear you,‚Äù Jake hissed.¬†

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry. He‚Äôs in the shower! I could be screaming blood murder down here and he wouldn‚Äôt notice,‚Äù she said in mock exasperation before giving a nervous giggle at her own wording.

‚ÄúSo what do you want me to do?‚Äù

A heavy sigh.

‚ÄúI want you to represent him when the time inevitably comes. It‚Äôs not like he was even remotely careful.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you want me to throw the case.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly!‚Äù

‚ÄúDeb, I don‚Äôt think that will go over well at the practice‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúJake. Honey. My knight in shining armor. I need you. Our daughter needs you. If he goes to prison, I can get the divorce, completely uncontested like we had hoped for. Then I will get the house, the money, the kids and we can be together. Finally. Do this for me, and I solemnly promise... I will do that thing you like. Whenever‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ want.‚Äù

Jake‚Äôs moan filtered softly up the stairs.

‚ÄúThank you, Jakey. I need to go pick the kids up from karate. Try and get him to tell you what he did, will you?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, darling.‚Äù

White-hot rage pumped through my veins.

*That bastard cucked me.*

I clenched my hands at my sides, blinding fury running through me, only to be cut through by the stinging pain in my hand. Glancing down I noticed blood dripping from the cuts onto the carpet below. *God dammit.*

I moved silently to the kids‚Äô bathroom and began the search for the bandages. I finally came across a box of Spider-Man Band-Aids and hurriedly slapped a couple across the cuts.

‚ÄúSteven?‚Äù Jake‚Äôs voice rang up from downstairs.

*Shit.*

I ran silently back to the master bathroom and into the shower before Jake could climb the stairs and notice I wasn‚Äôt in there.

I finished my shower, pretending I couldn‚Äôt hear Jake‚Äôs occasional shouts up, trying to decide what to do with my home-wrecking brother. I got out, and dressed distractedly.

‚ÄúSteven?‚Äù Jake yelled up again.

I grit my teeth. *Best not to let him know that I know until I decide what to do with the cocksucker.*

‚ÄúJake, that you?‚Äù I yelled back down.

‚ÄúYeah, bud. Can we talk?‚Äù He sounded like he must be in the kitchen.

I rolled my eyes and descended the stairs and made my way to the back of the house. Sure enough, he was making himself at home with one of my beers from the fridge.

‚ÄúSteven! Oh, man. It‚Äôs been a while hasn‚Äôt it,‚Äù he asked dumbly, pulling me into a hug.

*Less time than it‚Äôs been for my wife, no doubt.* *Fuckin slut.*

‚ÄúYup.‚Äù I pulled out of the hug and walked toward sink, pouring a glass of water while Jake continued jabbering behind me.

I stared at him appraisingly while he talked. I had to hand it to him, he was more handsome than me. Three years younger with a successful legal career and ridiculously thick hair in a douchy haircut. *How long have you been fucking her? Are you really that much better than me or is she just bored? Is your dick bigger than mine?*

I turned and faced the sliding glass door in disgust.

The mantis was there, a light glow emanating from her in the inky darkness of the evening. There was no denying, she had grown significantly. She had to be at least 9 inches long and having a hard time balancing on the outside edge of the windowsill. Her body moved back and forth eagerly. She waved a front leg over her head and flew back a few feet across the deck, waving the leg again as if to say, ‚ÄòFollow me.‚Äô

I hurriedly set the glass down on the counter, screeched open the sliding door and stepped outside, Jake‚Äôs voice getting increasingly louder as he followed behind me.

I trailed behind the mantis. She would fly back a few feet at a time and turn back to make sure I was keeping up. I followed her into the back shed, leaving Jake shouting at me in the middle of the yard.

I found her on top of a shelf, sitting between a pair of paint cans. She was dancing back and forth, carapace looking shiny black in the darkness. She tapped quickly.

**-.-- ¬†---¬† ..-¬† -.- -. --- .--¬† .-- ‚Ä¶. .- -¬† - ---¬† -.. ---**

‚ÄòYou know what to do.‚Äô

Jake was moving towards the shed now, voice raised.

‚ÄúSteven, what the fuck are you playing at, bud? Deb wanted us to talk about this little situation you‚Äôve made.‚Äù

He was in the door frame now, silhouetted by the light from the house, his face indiscernible in the contrasting lighting.

‚ÄúGod damn it‚Äôs dark in here. Is there a light or something?‚Äù He took a step forward into the shed.

The light tapping of the mantis‚Äô legs behind my head made my decision.

**‚Äú**Did you fuck my wife?‚Äù

He paused, no longer moving towards me. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou heard me, **brother**. Did you fuck my wife?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he asked indignantly ‚ÄúOf course not!‚Äù

I picked up the closest object, a wooden croquet mallet. I pulled it closer considering it. Jake had gotten the croquet set for Julie for her last birthday.

For his daughter.

Not mine.

With a mesmerizing woosh of air, I swung it at his head. He fell backwards, half of a front tooth shooting out of his mouth and whizzing past my ear. He fell on his ass just outside the shed, bleeding from the nose.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck, man!?‚Äù Jake cried in shock, hand over his mouth.

‚ÄúDid you fuck my wife?‚Äù I asked calmly, stepping out of the shed to stand over him, mallet in hand. Jake looked up at me, eyes calculating.

‚ÄúDid she tell you?‚Äù He finally asked, spitting blood and trying to get up.

‚ÄúDid you fuck my wife?‚Äù I questioned again, casually swinging the bloodied mallet up to rest on my shoulder. Jake flinched back, aborting his attempt to stand.

‚ÄúLook, bud. She came to me, She wasn‚Äôt feeling fulfilled.‚Äù His tone was both pitiful and caustic.

‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt the question.‚Äù

I swung the mallet down with force into his face with a satisfying, orgasmic *crunch*. Blood exploded outward from where Jake‚Äôs nose had been. His attempted screams turned into groans and honks. I giggled at how absurd he sounded. Like a goose in a pneumatic press.

‚ÄúYou fucked my wife. You let me think for years that Julie was mine. You made me provide for her. I don‚Äôt even fucking like the little shit! I should have known! She‚Äôs just like her father.‚Äù I laughed.

The mallet swung down again, shattering his right orbit with a shockingly loud pop. He howled in agony as he was knocked fully horizontal, hands slapped tightly over his eye.

The mantis appeared out of nowhere above Jake‚Äôs head, bouncing up and down in excitement.

I planted my legs on either side of Jake‚Äôs shoulders. Carefully, I lined up the croquet mallet with the side of his head, planning my shot. I pulled up the mallet slowly, let it arc back down next to his left ear. He screamed as the sticky wood made contact with his skin. I wound up and let it down again, perfecting the arc. Again. Satisfied, I pulled back and full strength swung the mallet down into the side of his head. Something in his neck made a sharp cracking noise as his right ear slamming into his shoulder, his left temple caved in. He shuddered violently for several seconds before coming completely and totally still. A ragged breath puffing out and his hands falling from his face.

The mantis raised her front legs in a ‚ÄòV‚Äô above her head, bouncing up and down in her ecstatic murder dance. I let the mallet drop to the ground.

‚ÄúEat up, gorgeous. I‚Äôll have more food for you soon,‚Äù I told her lovingly as I walked inside to wait for my whore wife, leaving her to eat my brother.",2,1754774610.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

A wet, slurping echo clung to the air as Mo tumbled out of the portal. This time, she at least landed on her feet, fighting the wobble in her knees and forcing a shred of dignity into her posture. Before this day, the last time she had to use a portal was when her parents decided to enroll Mo in that dark arts middle school. And then‚Ä¶ she lived on Earth for several years, not even considering moving elsewhere.

She stood there, adjusting to the strange, disorienting heaviness that always accompanied these portal jumps. Two times within a day, it was a bit too much. In her rogue years on Earth, the discomfort of the process had slipped her mind. The queasy churn in her stomach and the tingling in her limbs reminded her all too well of the sensation she definitely did not miss.

Stepping through a portal felt like plunging into cold water‚Äîunforgettable once you were in it again. But at least Mo was at her final destination now. Umbra Academy would be her home for at least a semester. She couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and dread at the thought.

Mo lingered at the Academy's iron gates, her grip on her ragged messenger bag tightening with each uneasy breath. Part of her wanted to return to the portal and run back to Earth‚Äî*anywhere* but here. But she forced herself to inhale, reminding herself she had what she needed‚Ä¶and no real way out.

The towering Gothic spires rose menacingly above her, their pointed silhouettes stark against the swirling, dark clouds of a sky that seemed forever on the verge of a tempest. The architecture reminded her of Blackthorn Keep with its eerie and foreboding design. Every arch and gargoyle seemed deliberately crafted to stir a sense of gloom. That was one of the reasons she ran from the previous school. That was one of the reasons she preferred serving coffee to studying the arcane arts.

Mo swallowed hard, feeling a lump in her throat, as her ginger hair lashed wildly around her face, caught in the gusts of the chilling wind that whispered of approaching storms. Something was shifting within her. Things that she hadn't explored for quite some time.

""Well, Mo,"" she muttered, ""you've really done it this time. Straight from cozy bookshop to villain boot camp. Don't think they offer good lattes here.""

With a deep breath, she forced herself to take a step forward. The iron gates creaked open, seeming to welcome her with malicious glee. As she walked through the courtyard, her eyes darted from one dramatic scene to another. A group of students to her left were engaged in what appeared to be a cape-flaring competition, their dark fabrics billowing with unnecessary gusto.

""Points for enthusiasm, I suppose,"" Mo thought, suppressing an eye-roll. ""Though I'm pretty sure capes went out of style with Dracula.""

She was keenly aware of the sideways looks and quiet murmurs trailing behind her. Her laid-back jeans and worn band t-shirt were glaringly out of place amidst the crowd, clad in black leather and velvet. Still, she had no intention of altering her personal style just to appease some dark-lord wannabes.

A boy with hair slicked so perfectly it looked shellacked paused mid-strut, his upper lip curling. ""So *that's* Earth's idea of villain chic?"" he drawled, tugging at his high collar as if to underscore how much better he looked. ""Could they degrade even more?""

Mo met his gaze head-on, her knuckles whitening around her bag strap as she offered a tight-lipped smile. ""Oh, you know, I'm going for the 'wolf in sheep's clothing' look. Very avant-garde evil.""

The boy's face contorted in confusion, clearly not catching the reference. Mo sighed inwardly. ""Tough crowd. Note to self: brush up on my dark puns.""

A booming voice echoed across the courtyard as she approached the main entrance. ""Behold, insignificant worms! I am Lord Obsidian, master of shadows and your new overlord!""

Mo turned to see a late teenager no older than herself balanced on a gargoyle, arms spread wide as though auditioning for for a gothic superhero flick. She couldn't help it. A snort of laughter escaped before she could stifle it.

Lord Obsidian's eyes narrowed dangerously. ""You dare mock the future ruler of all realms?""

""Sorry,"" Mo said, not sounding sorry at all. ""It's just... 'insignificant worms'? Bit on the nose, don't you think? Maybe try something more subtle, like 'valued citizens under new progressive management'?""

A hush fell over the courtyard. Mo felt her cheeks flush as she realized she'd just critiqued the monologue of someone who probably knew fifty ways to turn her into a toad.

""Right,"" she muttered, backing towards the entrance. ""I'll just... be going then. Lots of evil to learn, minions to recruit, you know how it is.""

As the heavy doors closed behind her, Mo leaned against them, her heart pounding. ""Fantastic,"" she groaned. ""First day, and I've already made enemies with the local megalomaniac. Mom and Dad would be so proud.""

She paused, raking her fingers through her hair, a flicker of defiance tugging at her lips. ""Actually, they'd probably expect no less from me,"" Mo muttered.

""They're *gone, but I'm still their legacy‚Äîlike it or not,""* she thought. An unexpected grin surfaced on her face. ""What would they say? Ah, yes. First, unsettle them. Then, take charge.""

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

Mo stood in a grand hall, surrounded by towering marble columns that reached up toward a ceiling shrouded in shadows, so distant it seemed to touch the sky. The moment she stepped inside, whispers slithered through the air, sharp and menacing, like poisoned daggers slicing through the silence. The sound ricocheted off the walls, bouncing from the ornate niches and hidden side chambers, creating an overwhelming symphony of eerie murmurs that pressed relentlessly against her ears.

""Isn't that Morgana Nightshade?"" a voice hissed from somewhere to Mo's left.

""I heard she flunked out of dark arts school on Earth,"" another voice chimed in, dripping with disdain.

""And left to live with normies‚Ä¶!""

""How scandalous!""

""Did she‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶?""

""Of course she did!""

Mo felt her shoulders tense, her fingers instinctively twirling a strand of her hair. She tried to look nonchalant, but her eyes darted around, taking in the sea of judgmental faces.

""Is she even a real Dark Lady?"" someone sneered loudly enough for her to hear.

""*Great,*"" Mo thought. ""*My reputation precedes me. And it's even worse than I imagined.*""

She slowly moved forward, her footsteps barely audible on the polished marble floor, until she was at the center of the hall. Mo's eyes flicked from one corridor to the next, uncertainty knotting in her stomach. There were plenty of people around her, but Mo didn't feel like asking any of them after that first welcome she'd experienced just a few seconds ago.

Without warning, a shimmering scroll appeared mid-air, hovering in front of her. It unfurled with a dramatic, electric crackle, revealing words that glowed in a menacing shade of crimson. The words seemed to pulse with an eerie life of their own. A deep, resonant voice, as if emerging from the very walls around her, began to read the message aloud:

""MORGANA ELARIS VEXARIA NYX NIGHTSHADE, SUCCUBUS, DARK LADY. UMBRA ACADEMY WELCOMES YOU. HERE IS YOUR ORIENTATION LETTER!""

Mo groaned inwardly. ""*Because blending in wasn't already impossible. Do they have to announce not only your status, but also your race? What is it? Middle ages?*""

The scroll's appearance, or, more probably, the words pronounced by the voice, seemed to amplify the whispers. Mo could feel the weight of countless sidelong glances, some curious, others openly hostile. She straightened her posture, trying to project an air of confidence she certainly didn't feel.

""Well,"" she muttered, ""nothing says 'welcome to school' quite like having one of your deepest insecurities broadcast to the entire student body.""

She swept her gaze across the crowd, meeting the stares head-on.

""Happy? Your announcement system thinks I'm a Dark Lady,"" she exclaimed, exasperated. ""Isn't that enough for you? What else do you want of me? You can go now, spread the rumors. Whatever‚Ä¶!""

Mo rolled her eyes, a sardonic smile playing at the corners of her mouth. ""*Might as well lean into it,*"" she thought. ""What's *the worst that could happen? Oh right, everything.*""

As if on cue, the sea of students parted, revealing a figure that seemed to embody everything Mo despised about villain society. Valerius Crowe strode forward, his cape billowing dramatically behind him despite the distinct lack of wind. His perfectly coiffed hair gleamed under the Academy's eerie lighting, and a smirk of pure condescension twisted his lips.

""Of course,"" Mo thought, suppressing a groan. ""It wouldn't be a proper villain school without the resident mean girl. Or boy, in this case.""

She squared her shoulders, bracing for the inevitable confrontation.

Valerius glided to a halt an arm's length away, tilting his head just enough that his dark hair caught the torchlight. His gaze flicked over her battered sneakers, and a smug grin curved his mouth.

""Well, well,"" he said softly, his voice like a cat's purr. He stood at a slight angle, half-blocking her path, as though to show off his perfect posture‚Äîand her apparent lack of it. ""If it isn't the prodigal failure. Returned at last."" he increased the volume of his voice, playing for the crowd. ""I've heard some interesting stories about your‚Ä¶ *adventures* on Earth.""

He scanned the hall, his eyes darting mischievously from one person to another. With each exaggerated raise and wiggle of his eyebrows, he silently communicated his intent, ensuring everyone understood the poisonous message behind his expression.

Mo felt her cheeks flush with anger, but she forced a bored expression onto her face. ""Valerius,"" she acknowledged flatly. ""Still practicing your dramatic entrances, I see. You know, in the human world, we just say 'hello' like normal people.""

A ripple of shocked gasps ran through the onlooking crowd. Valerius's eyes narrowed dangerously, but his smugness never wavered. ""Oh, Morgana,"" he said, his tone mock-sympathetic. ""That's exactly what I've heard! I never thought you'd fall so low. Consorting with humans. *Serving* them‚Ä¶""

The crowd gasped. But that didn't stop Valerius. On the contrary, he had more to say.

""Still clinging to those quaint human notions? How‚Ä¶ pitiful. How‚Ä¶ weak.""

Mo's fingers twitched, itching to fidget with her hair, but she forced them still. She wouldn't give Valerius the satisfaction of seeing her nervous tell. ""At least I've experienced something beyond these stuffy halls,"" she retorted, injecting as much confidence into her voice as she could muster. ""Tell me, Val, have you ever even seen a sunset that wasn't magically enhanced?""

Valerius's vicious smile twisted into a sneer. ""Why would I bother with such mundane spectacles when I could be honing my powers?"" He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a stage whisper that carried to the eager audience. ""Unlike some of us who've been‚Ä¶ such a disgrace‚Ä¶ what was it again? Ah, yes‚Ä¶ *stocking shelves* and serving *coffee* to pathetic mortals.""

His eyes scanned the crowd once more. He locked gazes with individuals whose eyes gleamed with curiosity, eager for the next juicy tidbit of scandal to unfold.

""Maybe even something else?"" he continued. ""Knowing your‚Ä¶ *race*.""

The throng of people swayed in a frenzy, a mix of murmurs and shouts echoing from all directions. Mo's name was shouted repeatedly, each call piercing through the air like a sudden clap of thunder. Laughter and giggles rippled through the gathering, cascading over Mo like a tidal wave, leaving her feeling engulfed and disoriented.

Mo felt a pang in her chest. Her time at the bookstore had been a sanctuary, a place where she'd felt genuinely happy. But what was even worse was Valerius's comment, which hit at the center of her insecurity. The cafe was a refuge where she could forget about all the baggage that came with her birthright. Not only as an heiress of a Dark Lord but also as a person who was supposed to seduce her underlings and enemies into complete obedience. Framed by Valerius's contempt, it sounded like a dirty secret, not an attempt to find her own path.

""Don't *let him get to you,*"" she told herself fiercely. ""*He knows you too well. He knows which buttons to push, which lies to spew. Those humans showed more kindness than this lot ever has.*""

""You know,"" Mo said, adopting a casual tone, ""I learned more about true villainy from a few months of retail work than you probably have in your entire time here.""

The crowd's attention ping-ponged between them, hungry for more drama. Valerius's eyes glittered dangerously, and Mo braced herself for his next verbal assault.

A voice cut through the tension, dripping with sarcasm. ""Woooow. That was embarrassing. For him. Publicly blurting out his midnight fantasies. Bold move.""

Mo's head snapped towards the source, her eyes landing on a figure that seemed to shimmer at the edges. One moment tall and imposing, the next lithe and graceful. Obsidian skin swirled with smoke-like patterns, and eyes that glowed like embers fixed on Valerius with undisguised amusement.

""Who in the nine hells is that?"" Mo wondered, a mix of curiosity and relief flooding through her.

The newcomer strolled in, cloak swirling around them with effortless flair. Valerius's attempt at drama seemed kindergarten-level by comparison. ""I mean, really,"" they continued, their voice taking on multiple harmonics that sent a shiver down Mo's spine. ""Mocking someone for having real-world experience? That's like bragging about never leaving your crypt.""

Mo felt a smirk tugging at her lips. She couldn't help but admire the stranger's audacity, even as she worried about the consequences of challenging Valerius so openly.

""And you are?"" Valerius sneered, his perfect composure finally cracking.

A new shimmering scroll materialized in the air, this one edged in flickering violet fire. Unlike Mo's, which had been grand and theatrical, this one hummed with restrained aggression‚Äîas if it was personally offended by its own existence.

The same booming disembodied voice that had announced Mo's status earlier returned, only this time, it carried a distinct note of frustration.

""NYXIR OBSCURIS, TITANBORN DEMON, SCION OF HOUSE OBSCURIS. UMBRA ACADEMY WELCOMES YOU. HERE IS YOUR ORIENTATION LETTER.""

A collective hush fell over the students. Heads turned toward the source of the announcement, eyes flickering with curiosity, judgment, and, in some cases, pure delight.

Nyx sighed loudly and rubbed their temples. ""Yeah, yeah, we get it. I exist. Move on.""

With a lazy flick of their wrist, Nyx sent a pulse of violet energy toward the scroll. It immediately exploded into harmless sparks, cutting itself off mid-title.

A gasp rippled through the crowd. Someone clutched their pearls. Someone else took notes, repeating the gesture.

Mo was equally impressed.

A slow single clap echoed across the hall. Mo didn't even need to turn around to know who it was.

""Ah, the great Nyxir Obscuris graces us with their presence,"" Valerius drawled, stepping forward, eyes gleaming with amusement. ""Or should I say, *themselves*? Or do you still need a moment to decide?""

A few students snickered.

Nyx tilted their head, their form flickering for half a second. A subtle shift in height, in build, in the sharpness of their jawline, before settling again. They turned to Valerius in the laziest way imaginable.

""Aw, Val, I didn't realize you were so *invested* in my personal journey,"" they cooed. ""What's wrong? Feeling a little insecure about all that 'unwavering masculinity'?""

Mo choked back a laugh.

The snickering turned into outright laughter. Valerius's smirk twitched ever so slightly.

Nyx stepped closer, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""If you ever need to talk about it, I'm here for you, babe. No judgment.""

Valerius's jaw clenched. His fingers twitched at his sides as if debating whether or not to hex Nyx on the spot.

Mo was officially a fan.

""Good talk,"" said Nyx.

Without waiting for a response from Valerius, they turned to Mo and gently threaded their arm through hers, their movement fluid and smooth. In an instant, the shapeshifter subtly altered their appearance once more, softening their hard features and relaxing their posture. The once sharp gaze now held warmth, and the tension in their shoulders melted away, all signs of aggression dissipating.

""Nyxir Obscuris,"" they said, their voice a melodious blend of tones. ""But you can call me Nyx. If that wouldn't be too much of a mess for us sharing a name. It's a pleasure to meet the infamous Morgana Nightshade in the flesh.""

Mo hesitated momentarily before shaking Nyx's hand, feeling a tingling warmth where their skin touched. ""*Infamous? Great. Just great.*""

""Please, it's Mo.""

""So,"" Nyx continued, leaning in conspiratorially. ""Mo‚Ä¶ Let me guess, he's been listing your failures alphabetically?""

Mo couldn't help but snort, her earlier tension easing slightly. ""Is it that obvious?""

Nyx's form rippled again, briefly taking on an exaggerated imitation of Valerius's pompous stance. ""Oh, darling,"" they drawled in perfect mimicry of his voice, ""it's written all over his insufferably smug face.""

""*I shouldn't laugh,*"" Mo thought, fighting to keep her expression neutral. ""*But damn, that's spot on.*""

Mo quirked an eyebrow, her lips twitching with suppressed amusement. ""We just got to 'D' for disgrace,"" she quipped, her voice dripping with mock solemnity. She tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear, a nervous habit she couldn't quite shake.

Nyx opened their mouth to respond, but a cold voice cut through the air like a blade.

""Speaking of disgrace,"" Valerius sneered, his perfect features twisted into a mask of disdain. He glided towards them, his cape billowing dramatically despite the lack of wind. ""I nearly forgot to mention that you aren't even a real Dark Lady. You have a full council controlling you. You know, *provisional.*"" He spat the last word as if it tasted foul.

Mo's stomach clenched. ""*Of course he'd bring that up,*"" she thought, fighting to keep her face neutral. ""*Stay calm. Don't let him see he's getting to you.*""

Nyx's eyes gleamed with something dangerously close to glee. ""Oh, Val,"" they purred, tilting their head in exaggerated thought. ""You're really leaning into that *provisional* insult, huh? I mean, sure, Morgana‚Ä¶ Mo has a whole council watching over her, but you, oh, you're completely independent and mature, right?""

Valerius' expression froze a fraction of a second before the sneer returned.

""Because if I recall correctly,"" Nyx continued, casually inspecting their nails that were even brighter than their attire, ""at Crowhurst High, our esteemed top student had a few‚Ä¶ what do they call it? Provisional permissions? Oh, right‚Äîbecause they weren't fully cleared for some magic courses yet.""

A ripple of whispers spread through the crowd.

""What are you blabbering there, Obscuris?!?""

Mo blinked. ""Wait. What? I didn't know that was even a thing!""

Nyx leaned in conspiratorially. ""You didn't know? Oh yeah, darling, during his first year, Mister Honors Student had to petition for special clearance in high-level dark arts. Apparently, certain instructors weren't convinced he had the, what was it? Oh‚Äî'properly developed prefrontal cortex to be a responsible unsupervised wielder of high-risk magic.'""

Valerius's gaze darkened. ""Careful, Obscuris."" His hand twitched as if he was ready to cast a spell.

Nyx grinned. ""Oh, it seems that your brain has still not fully developed. How's your impulse control?"" they glanced at Valerius's jittering hand. ""And you know better than confronting me. I am always being careful. Unlike the professors who had to clean up your 'unintentional' spell feedback loops.""

Mo covered her mouth to hide a laugh. ""Wait‚ÄîValerius? The perfect student? Had restrictions?""

Nyx nodded, delighted. ""It was tragic, really. He had to get written approval every time he wanted to practice 'unstable ritualistic blood incantations.'"" They sighed theatrically. ""Such an oppressive system, limiting our dear Valerius's genius.""

A few students stifled their laughter, their shoulders shaking with amusement. One student leaned over to a friend and loudly whispered, ""Wait, seriously?"" The room fell silent for a moment as all eyes darted nervously toward Valerius, checking to see if he had marked the culprit.

Valerius remained oblivious, though. His eyes locked intently on Nyx, his expression stern and unwavering.

""And yet, unlike you, I was able to finish the school with honors,"" he said. ""You‚Ä¶ Wretched thing! Unlike you, whose shifting was considered 'unpredictable and unrefined' during advanced battle simulations.""

Nyx shrugged, completely unfazed. ""Oh, absolutely. I'm a disaster. That's why I didn't throw a tantrum and demand exceptions to the rules.""

Valerius's eyes flashed dangerously.

Mo suppressed a grin. ""That's the first time I'm beginning to regret I flunked that school on Earth and left, you know‚Ä¶"" she looked at Nyx with a wide grin. ""‚Ä¶to consort with all these strange humans.""

She looked at Valerius again. ""You should have led with this, Val. So tell me‚Äîwhen you're not judging my status, does it ever bother you that you had to beg for special permissions back in the day?""

Valerius stiffened, then spun on his heel with a dramatic flick of his cape. ""Enjoy your first week, Nightshade. I doubt you'll last past that. I'm sure you'll run away like you did last time. I won't even need to make it hard for you.""

Nyx grinned after him. ""And yet, here she is.""

Mo exhaled, turning to Nyx. ""I could kiss you right now.""

""Dear, you'll have to buy me dinner first,"" said Nyx and winked.

Stepping through a portal felt like plunging into cold water‚Äîunforgettable once you were in it again. But at least Mo was at her final destination now. Umbra Academy would be her home for at least a semester. She couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and dread at the thought.

Mo lingered at the Academy's iron gates, her grip on her ragged messenger bag tightening with each uneasy breath. Part of her wanted to return to the portal and run back to Earth‚Äî*anywhere* but here. But she forced herself to inhale, reminding herself she had what she needed‚Ä¶and no real way out.

The towering Gothic spires rose menacingly above her, their pointed silhouettes stark against the swirling, dark clouds of a sky that seemed forever on the verge of a tempest. The architecture reminded her of Blackthorn Keep with its eerie and foreboding design. Every arch and gargoyle seemed deliberately crafted to stir a sense of gloom. That was one of the reasons she ran from the previous school. That was one of the reasons she preferred serving coffee to studying the arcane arts.

Mo swallowed hard, feeling a lump in her throat, as her ginger hair lashed wildly around her face, caught in the gusts of the chilling wind that whispered of approaching storms. Something was shifting within her. Things that she hadn't explored for quite some time.

""Well, Mo,"" she muttered, ""you've really done it this time. Straight from cozy bookshop to villain boot camp. Don't think they offer good lattes here.""

With a deep breath, she forced herself to take a step forward. The iron gates creaked open, seeming to welcome her with malicious glee. As she walked through the courtyard, her eyes darted from one dramatic scene to another. A group of students to her left were engaged in what appeared to be a cape-flaring competition, their dark fabrics billowing with unnecessary gusto.

""Points for enthusiasm, I suppose,"" Mo thought, suppressing an eye-roll. ""Though I'm pretty sure capes went out of style with Dracula.""

She was keenly aware of the sideways looks and quiet murmurs trailing behind her. Her laid-back jeans and worn band t-shirt were glaringly out of place amidst the crowd, clad in black leather and velvet. Still, she had no intention of altering her personal style just to appease some dark-lord wannabes.

A boy with hair slicked so perfectly it looked shellacked paused mid-strut, his upper lip curling. ""So *that's* Earth's idea of villain chic?"" he drawled, tugging at his high collar as if to underscore how much better he looked. ""Could they degrade even more?""

Mo met his gaze head-on, her knuckles whitening around her bag strap as she offered a tight-lipped smile. ""Oh, you know, I'm going for the 'wolf in sheep's clothing' look. Very avant-garde evil.""

The boy's face contorted in confusion, clearly not catching the reference. Mo sighed inwardly. ""Tough crowd. Note to self: brush up on my dark puns.""

A booming voice echoed across the courtyard as she approached the main entrance. ""Behold, insignificant worms! I am Lord Obsidian, master of shadows and your new overlord!""

Mo turned to see a late teenager no older than herself balanced on a gargoyle, arms spread wide as though auditioning for for a gothic superhero flick. She couldn't help it. A snort of laughter escaped before she could stifle it.

Lord Obsidian's eyes narrowed dangerously. ""You dare mock the future ruler of all realms?""

""Sorry,"" Mo said, not sounding sorry at all. ""It's just... 'insignificant worms'? Bit on the nose, don't you think? Maybe try something more subtle, like 'valued citizens under new progressive management'?""

A hush fell over the courtyard. Mo felt her cheeks flush as she realized she'd just critiqued the monologue of someone who probably knew fifty ways to turn her into a toad.

""Right,"" she muttered, backing towards the entrance. ""I'll just... be going then. Lots of evil to learn, minions to recruit, you know how it is.""

As the heavy doors closed behind her, Mo leaned against them, her heart pounding. ""Fantastic,"" she groaned. ""First day, and I've already made enemies with the local megalomaniac. Mom and Dad would be so proud.""

She paused, raking her fingers through her hair, a flicker of defiance tugging at her lips. ""Actually, they'd probably expect no less from me,"" Mo muttered.

""They're *gone, but I'm still their legacy‚Äîlike it or not,""* she thought. An unexpected grin surfaced on her face. ""What would they say? Ah, yes. First, unsettle them. Then, take charge.""

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

Mo stood in a grand hall, surrounded by towering marble columns that reached up toward a ceiling shrouded in shadows, so distant it seemed to touch the sky. The moment she stepped inside, whispers slithered through the air, sharp and menacing, like poisoned daggers slicing through the silence. The sound ricocheted off the walls, bouncing from the ornate niches and hidden side chambers, creating an overwhelming symphony of eerie murmurs that pressed relentlessly against her ears.

""Isn't that Morgana Nightshade?"" a voice hissed from somewhere to Mo's left.

""I heard she flunked out of dark arts school on Earth,"" another voice chimed in, dripping with disdain.

""And left to live with normies‚Ä¶!""

""How scandalous!""

""Did she‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶?""

""Of course she did!""

Mo felt her shoulders tense, her fingers instinctively twirling a strand of her hair. She tried to look nonchalant, but her eyes darted around, taking in the sea of judgmental faces.

""Is she even a real Dark Lady?"" someone sneered loudly enough for her to hear.

""*Great,*"" Mo thought. ""*My reputation precedes me. And it's even worse than I imagined.*""

She slowly moved forward, her footsteps barely audible on the polished marble floor, until she was at the center of the hall. Mo's eyes flicked from one corridor to the next, uncertainty knotting in her stomach. There were plenty of people around her, but Mo didn't feel like asking any of them after that first welcome she'd experienced just a few seconds ago.

Without warning, a shimmering scroll appeared mid-air, hovering in front of her. It unfurled with a dramatic, electric crackle, revealing words that glowed in a menacing shade of crimson. The words seemed to pulse with an eerie life of their own. A deep, resonant voice, as if emerging from the very walls around her, began to read the message aloud:

""MORGANA ELARIS VEXARIA NYX NIGHTSHADE, SUCCUBUS, DARK LADY. UMBRA ACADEMY WELCOMES YOU. HERE IS YOUR ORIENTATION LETTER!""

Mo groaned inwardly. ""*Because blending in wasn't already impossible. Do they have to announce not only your status, but also your race? What is it? Middle ages?*""

The scroll's appearance, or, more probably, the words pronounced by the voice, seemed to amplify the whispers. Mo could feel the weight of countless sidelong glances, some curious, others openly hostile. She straightened her posture, trying to project an air of confidence she certainly didn't feel.

""Well,"" she muttered, ""nothing says 'welcome to school' quite like having one of your deepest insecurities broadcast to the entire student body.""

She swept her gaze across the crowd, meeting the stares head-on.

""Happy? Your announcement system thinks I'm a Dark Lady,"" she exclaimed, exasperated. ""Isn't that enough for you? What else do you want of me? You can go now, spread the rumors. Whatever‚Ä¶!""

Mo rolled her eyes, a sardonic smile playing at the corners of her mouth. ""*Might as well lean into it,*"" she thought. ""What's *the worst that could happen? Oh right, everything.*""

As if on cue, the sea of students parted, revealing a figure that seemed to embody everything Mo despised about villain society. Valerius Crowe strode forward, his cape billowing dramatically behind him despite the distinct lack of wind. His perfectly coiffed hair gleamed under the Academy's eerie lighting, and a smirk of pure condescension twisted his lips.

""Of course,"" Mo thought, suppressing a groan. ""It wouldn't be a proper villain school without the resident mean girl. Or boy, in this case.""

She squared her shoulders, bracing for the inevitable confrontation.

Valerius glided to a halt an arm's length away, tilting his head just enough that his dark hair caught the torchlight. His gaze flicked over her battered sneakers, and a smug grin curved his mouth.

""Well, well,"" he said softly, his voice like a cat's purr. He stood at a slight angle, half-blocking her path, as though to show off his perfect posture‚Äîand her apparent lack of it. ""If it isn't the prodigal failure. Returned at last."" he increased the volume of his voice, playing for the crowd. ""I've heard some interesting stories about your‚Ä¶ *adventures* on Earth.""

He scanned the hall, his eyes darting mischievously from one person to another. With each exaggerated raise and wiggle of his eyebrows, he silently communicated his intent, ensuring everyone understood the poisonous message behind his expression.

Mo felt her cheeks flush with anger, but she forced a bored expression onto her face. ""Valerius,"" she acknowledged flatly. ""Still practicing your dramatic entrances, I see. You know, in the human world, we just say 'hello' like normal people.""

A ripple of shocked gasps ran through the onlooking crowd. Valerius's eyes narrowed dangerously, but his smugness never wavered. ""Oh, Morgana,"" he said, his tone mock-sympathetic. ""That's exactly what I've heard! I never thought you'd fall so low. Consorting with humans. *Serving* them‚Ä¶""

The crowd gasped. But that didn't stop Valerius. On the contrary, he had more to say.

""Still clinging to those quaint human notions? How‚Ä¶ pitiful. How‚Ä¶ weak.""

Mo's fingers twitched, itching to fidget with her hair, but she forced them still. She wouldn't give Valerius the satisfaction of seeing her nervous tell. ""At least I've experienced something beyond these stuffy halls,"" she retorted, injecting as much confidence into her voice as she could muster. ""Tell me, Val, have you ever even seen a sunset that wasn't magically enhanced?""

Valerius's vicious smile twisted into a sneer. ""Why would I bother with such mundane spectacles when I could be honing my powers?"" He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a stage whisper that carried to the eager audience. ""Unlike some of us who've been‚Ä¶ such a disgrace‚Ä¶ what was it again? Ah, yes‚Ä¶ *stocking shelves* and serving *coffee* to pathetic mortals.""

His eyes scanned the crowd once more. He locked gazes with individuals whose eyes gleamed with curiosity, eager for the next juicy tidbit of scandal to unfold.

""Maybe even something else?"" he continued. ""Knowing your‚Ä¶ *race*.""

The throng of people swayed in a frenzy, a mix of murmurs and shouts echoing from all directions. Mo's name was shouted repeatedly, each call piercing through the air like a sudden clap of thunder. Laughter and giggles rippled through the gathering, cascading over Mo like a tidal wave, leaving her feeling engulfed and disoriented.

Mo felt a pang in her chest. Her time at the bookstore had been a sanctuary, a place where she'd felt genuinely happy. But what was even worse was Valerius's comment, which hit at the center of her insecurity. The cafe was a refuge where she could forget about all the baggage that came with her birthright. Not only as an heiress of a Dark Lord but also as a person who was supposed to seduce her underlings and enemies into complete obedience. Framed by Valerius's contempt, it sounded like a dirty secret, not an attempt to find her own path.

""Don't *let him get to you,*"" she told herself fiercely. ""*He knows you too well. He knows which buttons to push, which lies to spew. Those humans showed more kindness than this lot ever has.*""

""You know,"" Mo said, adopting a casual tone, ""I learned more about true villainy from a few months of retail work than you probably have in your entire time here.""

The crowd's attention ping-ponged between them, hungry for more drama. Valerius's eyes glittered dangerously, and Mo braced herself for his next verbal assault.

A voice cut through the tension, dripping with sarcasm. ""Woooow. That was embarrassing. For him. Publicly blurting out his midnight fantasies. Bold move.""

Mo's head snapped towards the source, her eyes landing on a figure that seemed to shimmer at the edges. One moment tall and imposing, the next lithe and graceful. Obsidian skin swirled with smoke-like patterns, and eyes that glowed like embers fixed on Valerius with undisguised amusement.

""Who in the nine hells is that?"" Mo wondered, a mix of curiosity and relief flooding through her.

The newcomer strolled in, cloak swirling around them with effortless flair. Valerius's attempt at drama seemed kindergarten-level by comparison. ""I mean, really,"" they continued, their voice taking on multiple harmonics that sent a shiver down Mo's spine. ""Mocking someone for having real-world experience? That's like bragging about never leaving your crypt.""

Mo felt a smirk tugging at her lips. She couldn't help but admire the stranger's audacity, even as she worried about the consequences of challenging Valerius so openly.

""And you are?"" Valerius sneered, his perfect composure finally cracking.

A new shimmering scroll materialized in the air, this one edged in flickering violet fire. Unlike Mo's, which had been grand and theatrical, this one hummed with restrained aggression‚Äîas if it was personally offended by its own existence.

The same booming disembodied voice that had announced Mo's status earlier returned, only this time, it carried a distinct note of frustration.

""NYXIR OBSCURIS, TITANBORN DEMON, SCION OF HOUSE OBSCURIS. UMBRA ACADEMY WELCOMES YOU. HERE IS YOUR ORIENTATION LETTER.""

A collective hush fell over the students. Heads turned toward the source of the announcement, eyes flickering with curiosity, judgment, and, in some cases, pure delight.

Nyx sighed loudly and rubbed their temples. ""Yeah, yeah, we get it. I exist. Move on.""

With a lazy flick of their wrist, Nyx sent a pulse of violet energy toward the scroll. It immediately exploded into harmless sparks, cutting itself off mid-title.

A gasp rippled through the crowd. Someone clutched their pearls. Someone else took notes, repeating the gesture.

Mo was equally impressed.

A slow single clap echoed across the hall. Mo didn't even need to turn around to know who it was.

""Ah, the great Nyxir Obscuris graces us with their presence,"" Valerius drawled, stepping forward, eyes gleaming with amusement. ""Or should I say, *themselves*? Or do you still need a moment to decide?""

A few students snickered.

Nyx tilted their head, their form flickering for half a second. A subtle shift in height, in build, in the sharpness of their jawline, before settling again. They turned to Valerius in the laziest way imaginable.

""Aw, Val, I didn't realize you were so *invested* in my personal journey,"" they cooed. ""What's wrong? Feeling a little insecure about all that 'unwavering masculinity'?""

Mo choked back a laugh.

The snickering turned into outright laughter. Valerius's smirk twitched ever so slightly.

Nyx stepped closer, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""If you ever need to talk about it, I'm here for you, babe. No judgment.""

Valerius's jaw clenched. His fingers twitched at his sides as if debating whether or not to hex Nyx on the spot.

Mo was officially a fan.

""Good talk,"" said Nyx.

Without waiting for a response from Valerius, they turned to Mo and gently threaded their arm through hers, their movement fluid and smooth. In an instant, the shapeshifter subtly altered their appearance once more, softening their hard features and relaxing their posture. The once sharp gaze now held warmth, and the tension in their shoulders melted away, all signs of aggression dissipating.

""Nyxir Obscuris,"" they said, their voice a melodious blend of tones. ""But you can call me Nyx. If that wouldn't be too much of a mess for us sharing a name. It's a pleasure to meet the infamous Morgana Nightshade in the flesh.""

Mo hesitated momentarily before shaking Nyx's hand, feeling a tingling warmth where their skin touched. ""*Infamous? Great. Just great.*""

""Please, it's Mo.""

""So,"" Nyx continued, leaning in conspiratorially. ""Mo‚Ä¶ Let me guess, he's been listing your failures alphabetically?""

Mo couldn't help but snort, her earlier tension easing slightly. ""Is it that obvious?""

Nyx's form rippled again, briefly taking on an exaggerated imitation of Valerius's pompous stance. ""Oh, darling,"" they drawled in perfect mimicry of his voice, ""it's written all over his insufferably smug face.""

""*I shouldn't laugh,*"" Mo thought, fighting to keep her expression neutral. ""*But damn, that's spot on.*""

Mo quirked an eyebrow, her lips twitching with suppressed amusement. ""We just got to 'D' for disgrace,"" she quipped, her voice dripping with mock solemnity. She tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear, a nervous habit she couldn't quite shake.

Nyx opened their mouth to respond, but a cold voice cut through the air like a blade.

""Speaking of disgrace,"" Valerius sneered, his perfect features twisted into a mask of disdain. He glided towards them, his cape billowing dramatically despite the lack of wind. ""I nearly forgot to mention that you aren't even a real Dark Lady. You have a full council controlling you. You know, *provisional.*"" He spat the last word as if it tasted foul.

Mo's stomach clenched. ""*Of course he'd bring that up,*"" she thought, fighting to keep her face neutral. ""*Stay calm. Don't let him see he's getting to you.*""

Nyx's eyes gleamed with something dangerously close to glee. ""Oh, Val,"" they purred, tilting their head in exaggerated thought. ""You're really leaning into that *provisional* insult, huh? I mean, sure, Morgana‚Ä¶ Mo has a whole council watching over her, but you, oh, you're completely independent and mature, right?""

Valerius' expression froze a fraction of a second before the sneer returned.

""Because if I recall correctly,"" Nyx continued, casually inspecting their nails that were even brighter than their attire, ""at Crowhurst High, our esteemed top student had a few‚Ä¶ what do they call it? Provisional permissions? Oh, right‚Äîbecause they weren't fully cleared for some magic courses yet.""

A ripple of whispers spread through the crowd.

""What are you blabbering there, Obscuris?!?""

Mo blinked. ""Wait. What? I didn't know that was even a thing!""

Nyx leaned in conspiratorially. ""You didn't know? Oh yeah, darling, during his first year, Mister Honors Student had to petition for special clearance in high-level dark arts. Apparently, certain instructors weren't convinced he had the, what was it? Oh‚Äî'properly developed prefrontal cortex to be a responsible unsupervised wielder of high-risk magic.'""

Valerius's gaze darkened. ""Careful, Obscuris."" His hand twitched as if he was ready to cast a spell.

Nyx grinned. ""Oh, it seems that your brain has still not fully developed. How's your impulse control?"" they glanced at Valerius's jittering hand. ""And you know better than confronting me. I am always being careful. Unlike the professors who had to clean up your 'unintentional' spell feedback loops.""

Mo covered her mouth to hide a laugh. ""Wait‚ÄîValerius? The perfect student? Had restrictions?""

Nyx nodded, delighted. ""It was tragic, really. He had to get written approval every time he wanted to practice 'unstable ritualistic blood incantations.'"" They sighed theatrically. ""Such an oppressive system, limiting our dear Valerius's genius.""

A few students stifled their laughter, their shoulders shaking with amusement. One student leaned over to a friend and loudly whispered, ""Wait, seriously?"" The room fell silent for a moment as all eyes darted nervously toward Valerius, checking to see if he had marked the culprit.

Valerius remained oblivious, though. His eyes locked intently on Nyx, his expression stern and unwavering.

""And yet, unlike you, I was able to finish the school with honors,"" he said. ""You‚Ä¶ Wretched thing! Unlike you, whose shifting was considered 'unpredictable and unrefined' during advanced battle simulations.""

Nyx shrugged, completely unfazed. ""Oh, absolutely. I'm a disaster. That's why I didn't throw a tantrum and demand exceptions to the rules.""

Valerius's eyes flashed dangerously.

Mo suppressed a grin. ""That's the first time I'm beginning to regret I flunked that school on Earth and left, you know‚Ä¶"" she looked at Nyx with a wide grin. ""‚Ä¶to consort with all these strange humans.""

She looked at Valerius again. ""You should have led with this, Val. So tell me‚Äîwhen you're not judging my status, does it ever bother you that you had to beg for special permissions back in the day?""

Valerius stiffened, then spun on his heel with a dramatic flick of his cape. ""Enjoy your first week, Nightshade. I doubt you'll last past that. I'm sure you'll run away like you did last time. I won't even need to make it hard for you.""

Nyx grinned after him. ""And yet, here she is.""

Mo exhaled, turning to Nyx. ""I could kiss you right now.""

""Dear, you'll have to buy me dinner first,"" said Nyx and winked.

Why this works:

You're reaching out when they're already thinking about the problem. 

Each email references something they actually did (social proof)

Everything is contextual with low-pressure asks.

How I track these signals:

Started manually: LinkedIn alerts, competitor monitoring, news tracking

Now automated with my own tool (but manual still works if budget's tight) 

The results:¬†40-60% response rates vs. 2-5% for cold outreach.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Doctor Andrew Scheele, Senior Researcher at the UN-VR Cooperative Institute of Integrative Xenobiology***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 29th, 2136*

With each day I arrived at the facility, it seemed that more and more people wanted to talk to me. Whether it be about AI or mysterious genes, I had evidently become the subject of many a researcher‚Äôs interest.

My email inbox was overflowing to the point that a few Venlil had apparently become inspired enough to face their human-related fears and approach me personally. I‚Äôd heard lots of elevator pitches, some of which actually took place in an elevator. It was usually about AI or proteins that shouldn‚Äôt exist, although the boldest and most recent individual asked me for a sample of my hair.

‚ÄúFor genomic sequencing, of course,‚Äù the man said, in response to a query I was now regretting asking. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs vast insights to be gleaned!‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs plenty of other human genomes you can look at,‚Äù I replied, trying not to let my numerous feelings creep into my voice. ‚ÄúIn fact, they‚Äôve been made compatible with software you‚Äôre probably familiar with.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but those have been processed and altered beyond its biological source. I require something more pure for my study.‚Äù

I recognized that I needed to avoid asking about his research at all costs, lest I get sucked into another long and very one-sided conversation. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure your study is very important, but I have to respectfully decline.‚Äù

His ears wilted, but only briefly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure once you hear about what my research is about, you‚Äôll‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAgain, I have to decline,‚Äù I interrupted, pulling out my holopad. I began typing out an SOS message to Bemlin. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what use a single genome has in any kind of study.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great question! Originally, I wasn‚Äôt going to include humans in my research at all, but I recently attended a board meeting. Hastum said you were invited via email, though truthfully‚Ä¶‚Äù He shook himself. ‚ÄúBut we discussed many things. Rosim in particular had some things to bring up from a conversation you had with him. The potential of the human genome has inspired quite a few to seriously consider using it for their studies. Unexplored and ripe for discovery!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt intend to miss the meeting I was just now learning about, but of course the only communication I supposedly got was by *email*. Despite that, it was good to hear that Rosim had considered my perspective on his GWASs he was planning, although field DNA extraction wasn‚Äôt an outcome I expected. ‚ÄúBut why *mine*, specifically?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I guess any pred‚Äî *human* would suffice, but I just figured‚Ä¶ you know, since you‚Äôre here?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ I have to say that my answer remains the same. My genome is kind of a semi-private thing, and I‚Äôm hoping it stays that way for a while longer. I, uh‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off, completely unsure of any words to work myself out of this one. Fortunately, my spiny savior emerged at the doorway to my office. ‚ÄúBemlin! There you are!‚Äù

The Gojid‚Äôs eyes drifted from me to the DNA-seeking Venlil. ‚ÄúWhat is your message supposed to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúGlad you‚Äôre here,‚Äù I interrupted. ‚ÄúWe have plenty to talk about. Ah, if you‚Äôll excuse us‚Ä¶?‚Äù

The Venlil stood, somewhat abashed. ‚ÄúOh, yes, of course. But, um, will you at least consider‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I flatly said. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll send you all an anonymous database you can take a peek at.‚Äù

The Venlil, who‚Äôs name slipped my mind (I‚Äôm not sure he even introduced himself before getting straight to business and asking for my hair), seemed to relent and finally left my office. I closed the door behind him, leaving me and Bemlin in peace.

I slipped my mask off. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

Bemlin gave me his usual stare, this time with a dash of judgment. ‚ÄúThis is the second time you have used me to escape a situation. I believe you need to seek alternative methods.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not escaping, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a convenient check-in on how you‚Äôre doing. How are you doing, by the way?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am slightly irritated that I am being pulled from my work for ingenuine purposes. It is within your capabilities to simply tell them you are preoccupied.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very genuine, believe me. And I tried to do that, but the guy was persistent. How‚Äôs the structure prediction going?‚Äù

Bemlin paused, but allowed the subject to change. ‚ÄúI have catalogued the five genes and their predicted structures. Although the two genes we found without introns are somewhat strange.‚Äù

I recalled the five genes that GenomIQ had found, and the two odd ones. ‚ÄúStrange how? Other than lacking introns, of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúTheir structures do not look like anything useful. I have been extensively looking through resources, but I‚Äôm afraid I lack the insight of a structural biologist.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôve used most of what Gamma Fold has to offer‚Ä¶ What has Tanerik done?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs amended his mistakes, though it is much the same regarding those two genes. They do not appear homologous to any human protein. Perhaps Acetli‚Äôs doubts are correct?‚Äù

I rubbed my chin, frowning. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to give up quite yet‚Ä¶ Maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù

As if perfectly planned to interrupt my thoughts, there was a knock at the door.

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúSee what I‚Äôm talking about, Bemlin? They‚Äôve been getting more frequent.‚Äù

He waved a dismissive claw. ‚ÄúThey will understand if you are busy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt mind if I use you to ‚Äòescape‚Äô a third time?‚Äù I said, already reaching for my mask. ‚ÄúYou think if I don‚Äôt put this on, it‚Äôll keep them away?‚Äù

He thought for a moment. ‚ÄúThat is not your worst idea, though not for the reasons you wish to exploit. In fact, aside from the fainting-prone receptionists, I fail to see much reason in wearing it at all.‚Äù

I snorted, putting my mask on. ‚ÄúYeah, ask the others what they think of that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was already planning on it, in fact.‚Äù

I wondered what Bemlin meant by that. I tugged the door open, already preparing a line to dismiss a Venlil, but I instead saw a Yotul.

‚ÄúCelso!‚Äù I said, my mood immediately flipping. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see you come in earlier. What‚Äôs up? How are the calluses doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúHi, Andrew! And Bemlin!‚Äù Celso said, regarding the Gojid. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt checked the calluses today. I actually sort of just showed up.‚Äù His ears fell, embarrassed.

I shrugged, unbothered. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt be too late, right? What time is it, Bemlin?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe got here a little less than a claw ago,‚Äù he answered.

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I frowned. I didn't entirely mind Celso coming in late. One of the great things about lab jobs is that sometimes there's not much work to do and you get to go home early‚Ä¶ or sleep in. However, the Yotul's expression made it seem like something much more serious had happened. ‚ÄúDid a time-sensitive experiment get ruined? Do I need to order some‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, nothing like that!‚Äù Celso quickly said, standing straight. ‚ÄúI just thought I‚Äôd tell you. Nothing to worry about! I‚Äôll just stay late to compensate.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, if you absolutely need to‚Ä¶ Things are already moving forward faster than I was expecting.‚Äù I shrugged. ‚ÄúYou want some coffee? Pot‚Äôs probably cold, but we can warm it up.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, no thanks,‚Äù he said, looking like he was expecting an entirely different response from me. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt want to know why? It‚Äôs not an issue at all?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got a good reason. Unless it‚Äôs a funny story, maybe.‚Äù I shrugged again.

His expression slowly shifted. ‚ÄúIt could be considered funny, maybe. It involved a glass of mango juice and a certain animal I hadn‚Äôt seen in a while. Oh, there was a pair of human hands, too. Not attached to a human, I should clarify.‚Äù

I felt as though that clarified nothing at all. ‚ÄúThat, uh, does sound important.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of human hands?‚Äù Bemlin asked, interest piqued.

‚ÄúI could wear them. Moving the fifth finger was weird, though,‚Äù said Celso.

‚ÄúFascinating. Were they as nimble as you anticipated?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really anticipating anything, so yes. Why do you ask? Fancy a pair of human hands, Bemlin?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I merely wish to satisfy a mental comparison I have been keeping. I believe their use cases as dedicated tools would be very limited.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy hands are great, thank you very much,‚Äù I retorted.

‚ÄúPerhaps. Perhaps you are biased.‚Äù

I considered him lucky he didn‚Äôt catch my scowl hidden by my mask. I turned back to Celso. ‚ÄúAnyways‚Ä¶ So long as things are reasonably progressing, you can show up when I‚Äôm asleep for all I care. Not that I'd entirely *recommend that*, but that‚Äôs your judgment. I‚Äôll make sure Bemlin doesn‚Äôt scold you.‚Äù

Bemlin was not amused. ‚ÄúI am nobody‚Äôs boss‚Ä¶ although some amount of schedule overlap is necessary. Of course, this planet does not make such a task trivial.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can *not* wake up without my alarm and auto-blinds,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúHonestly, I‚Äôm impressed with how well you‚Äôre functioning without your pad, Celso‚Ä¶ which reminds me! Nalek said we‚Äôre expecting new holopads sometime next week. It‚Äôs supposed to coincide with when the rest of the human researchers are showing up.‚Äù

The Yotul‚Äôs ears perked up. ‚ÄúSweet! I‚Äôll have to make the most out of my time with the notebook you gave me.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow has your project been progressing, Celso?‚Äù asked Bemlin, twirling a claw. ‚ÄúI feel I never see you outside of when you first show up each day.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been going great! Which is also probably why you hardly see me. I‚Äôve been getting pretty good at using the six-shooter.‚Äù

Bemlin gave me an inquisitive stare.

‚ÄúThe gene gun,‚Äù I answered, smiling. ‚ÄúYou know, Bemlin, I feel like you might enjoy old Western movies. You too, Celso.‚Äù

Bemlin tilted his head. ‚ÄúDated films produced in a specific hemisphere of your planet?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more about the general vibes, but you‚Äôre not wrong I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúHm‚Ä¶ I will add that to my list,‚Äù the Gojid said. He turned back to Celso. ‚ÄúHow are you finding things in the lab? Has it exceeded your expectations?‚Äù

My smile faded. My conversation with Bemlin about the subject of ‚Äúprimitiveness‚Äù hadn't continued past our brief holiday shopping adventure. I hadn't brought it up with Acetli or Tanerik, either. In honesty, that was partly because they didn't give me a reason to do so, partly because I was somewhat daunted by the awkwardness that would arise if I called them out on a belief they didn‚Äôt even hold. I really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, even if I should know better.

‚ÄúIt has!‚Äù Celso energetically replied. ‚ÄúEverything here is leagues better than what I‚Äôve had previously.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt has been some time since I‚Äôve done wet lab work. That makes me curious, if I may ask another question of you, what is your degree in?‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter my undergraduate degree? I spent around 5 years researching plant photosystems and their oxidation and reduction chemistry.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, you are a *doctor*, then? Andrew failed to inform me of this.‚Äù The Gojid gave me a stare.

‚ÄúOh, well, technically it‚Äôs only a master‚Äôs degree,‚Äù Celso quietly corrected.

Bemlin looked at Celso, then back at me, expecting some kind of explanation. I shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just a title. I‚Äôve worked for people who know *way* more than I do and they never went to grad school. If you can play the part, it doesn‚Äôt matter where you came from. You definitely play the part, Celso.‚Äù

He nodded, almost imperceptibly, and humbly replied, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI suppose education on Leirn is different.‚Äù Bemlin said, apparently satisfied. ‚ÄúAside from your work, what else is being researched on Leirn, from a planetary perspective? Is there a primary focus, or more broad?‚Äù

Celso looked relieved that the topic shifted. ‚ÄúThings have changed recently, but before I left, biology research in particular was really popular. Diseases, agriculture, the like.‚Äù

The Gojid waved a claw. ‚ÄúBiology is at the forefront, as always. I believe you have made a good decision, dedicating your career to it. Many others are deterred from such commitment and hard work.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, Bemlin?‚Äù I interjected lightly. I knew he wasn't the type to take our previous conversation lightly, but I couldn't help but feel a little irked. ‚ÄúJust a reminder about Federation influence.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave I made an offensive comment?‚Äù he bluntly replied.

‚ÄúNo, but it might be worth mentioning.‚Äù

Bemlin‚Äôs voice took a hardly noticeable defensive edge. ‚ÄúI am very aware of what the Federation has done, and have thought about your suggestion to keep an open mind. More so than other disciplines, biology requires novel research coinciding with modern developments. It is commendable for a member of a primitive species to catch oneself up to current knowledge, but to actively push the field forward is much more.‚Äù

I winced. ‚ÄúCan we avoid that word? Primitive? It really isn‚Äôt helpful.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it not an apt descriptor for the Yotul? Do you suggest an alternative?‚Äù

‚ÄúI should probably get to work,‚Äù Celso said, popping back into existence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll catch you both later, it was fun talking!‚Äù

My face grew warm. I opened my mouth to make a response, but he was already walking away. I let out a deep sigh, reaching to pinch my nose in disappointment, but the mask in the way rudely blocked the action.

Bemlin spoke first, apparently unphased. ‚ÄúWhy does he not have a holopad? And why have you not pushed harder for a quick replacement if that is the case? Do you not want him to be efficient?‚Äù

‚ÄúBemlin, I‚Äî‚Äù I stopped myself, gathering my wits before trying again. ‚ÄúFirst of all, please don‚Äôt call him, or anything else, primitive. It‚Äôs like calling me ‚Äòpredator‚Äô. By some absurd stretch of the definition, it is true, but it‚Äôs insulting and degrading. Secondly, I have been trying, but I‚Äôve also been very busy with reports and emails and weirdos who want a strand of my hair. He‚Äôs fine without one and, more importantly, *I* am. In fact, we‚Äôre already past where I thought we‚Äôd be *without* all the efficiencies a pad brings. He‚Äôs adapting super quickly. It‚Äôs *fine*.‚Äù

The Gojid waited a moment before speaking. ‚ÄúI apologize.‚Äù

I took another breath. ‚ÄúIt's very important to me that everyone is comfortable here. I‚Äôve gone through bad workplaces before and seen the worst of what can happen.‚Äù

Another brief silence. ‚ÄúShould he be held to less praise because it may come off as derogatory, or higher praise because he has indeed made it to where he is under much harder circumstances? This distinction is not clear to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a complicated question. You could probably get a hundred different answers, but start with treating him as an equal. I mean, nobody‚Äôs going to react the same way to stuff like that, but if you put in honest effort to know him‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged.

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù Bemlin said, contemplative. ‚ÄúForgive me, I misunderstood the weight with which you carried this topic.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be *clear*, this isn‚Äôt for me, or even just Celso. It‚Äôs for everyone, which includes you. And even beyond the person, everything from quantity to quality of results are simply better when the person working on them is happy, when they feel like they belong.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave‚Ä¶ humans studied this? Or a similar enough topic? I must assume so. Would it fall under human studies of the brain? Thinking and behavior?‚Äù

When we were still on Earth, Bemlin had acquired an interest in psychology. One day, he approached me with a list of words that he didn‚Äôt understand the meaning of‚Äîthings like ‚Äúsociopathy‚Äù, ‚Äúanxiety disorder‚Äù, and a slew of other psychological conditions. He was fascinated with human advances in the field the same way I was disturbed by the lack thereof in the Federation.

I replied, ‚ÄúYeah, psychology. Plus tons of other stuff, but I‚Äôm really not the right person to talk to about all that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will try to learn more.‚Äù Bemlin tapped a claw against his leg. ‚ÄúI have not seen this side of you. Is it common for humans to have such a strong sense of justice?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Maybe. Depends. People sure have a sense of justice when it comes to themselves, but it gets harder the further away from your center you go. I guess I‚Äôm trying, maybe unsuccessfully, to not be that person.‚Äù

It was very hard to spot, but Bemlin‚Äôs expression subtly shifted. Given the context, it seemed out of curiosity. ‚ÄúWhat is your motivation to do so?‚Äù

I snorted. ‚ÄúWhy, is this another ‚Äòpredator‚Äô thing you‚Äôre surprised by?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is tangential, yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged. ‚ÄúIt probably has to do with grad school and all the industry jobs I hopped around in. But grad school especially‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôve just seen what a toxic environment can do to someone.‚Äù

Bemlin stared at me, wanting me to continue.

I took off my mask and tossed it onto my desk with a dull thud. ‚ÄúWell, uh, I used to know this other grad student, Srinivas. He was about two years further than me into his PhD, worked in the lab right next to mine, and we talked *all the time*. He helped me fix one of our spectrometers, and kind of started that whole area of my experience. Anyway, we always talked about the sucky parts of our respective labs. We‚Äôd rant on about having to do fourteen hour-long experiments and a few days later complain about said fourteen hour-long experiments going wrong. See, I thought *my* lab was demanding, but the amount of stories Srinivas told me, jeez. And then there were PI and personal issues, you know.

‚ÄúWell, uh, it turns out that Srinivas had even more stuff going on than he talked about. A lot more.‚Äù I shook my head. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ can tell you more later. But I, uh, learned that people can be very hard on themselves. They really don‚Äôt need anyone else‚Äîbe it a harsh boss or coworker‚Äîcompounding the issue. And now that I‚Äôm in a position where I can actually prevent a similar situation from happening, it‚Äôs in this weird alien culture where everyone‚Äôs racist and nobody does anything or even cares about it and I‚Äôm a subsapient freak that eats meat and‚Äî It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a lot, right? So can we just treat each other like equals? We‚Äôre all just here to do some science.‚Äù

Bemlin stared at me with analytical eyes.

I looked away towards my monitor. ‚ÄúI should probably get back to writing this report. I still have to include what we found about the genes without introns and it‚Äôs due by the end of today.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want a hug?‚Äù he abruptly asked.

My nose wrinkled in surprise. ‚ÄúBemlin, I know very well you don‚Äôt do hugs.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have not forgotten what I have learned,‚Äù he replied, matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúHugs are beneficial in a myriad of ways. That is common in this galaxy, and is no different for humans.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but smile. I might‚Äôve hugged the Gojid once, maybe twice before. ‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt have to. The height difference makes it tricky, and I don‚Äôt remember how I dealt with your spines last time.‚Äù

Bemlin awkwardly spread his arms, refusing my refusal. Or maybe it was a challenge to my last point. With an eye-roll he couldn‚Äôt see, I arched my back and put my arms around him. It wasn‚Äôt like hugging a cactus, more like a tree that had particularly rugged bark‚Äîso long as I didn‚Äôt squeeze too hard. His claws poked into my back and the whole position was honestly pretty uncomfortable, but I couldn‚Äôt wipe the smile off my face.

After a moment, I straightened my back. ‚ÄúThere. Hug done. I‚Äôm feeling better already.‚Äù

Bemlin‚Äôs expression was difficult to read. ‚ÄúYour voice is not as enthusiastic as your face.‚Äù

I laughed. ‚ÄúYeah, whatever. I have work to do. *You* have work to do.‚Äù

He wagged a claw‚Äîan unbelievably *sassy* claw‚Äîand walked out of my office.

My shoulders sagged with a sigh. On top of everything else I had to do before leaving today, I now needed to make an apology.

Hey! Gah, I keep trying to get these out at least every two weeks, but things keep happening. My lab's funding ended so I have to find a new job, so I've been rushing to get my data crunched before I leave, I was out of state for half a week, and in general I have a ***very*** long to-do list.

1mm0ic0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1mm0ic0/story_so_far/,Story so far,"I'm in my third month on Mounjaro, nearing the end of my first week at 5 mg. Everyone is different, but this is how it is for me -  By day five, I‚Äôm starting to feel hungry again, no different really to how I felt on 2.5mg.  By day six, the ‚Äúfood noise‚Äù creeps back , but I‚Äôm still satisfied with relatively small portions, again, like 2.5.

TBH, part of me values this phase because it forces me to confront the urges that made me overweight in the first place... For example, this morning, the chocolate Hobnobs were practically screaming at me to be eaten. Was I hungry? No. Did I want them? Abso-fucking-lutely. But I didn‚Äôt cave.

Mounjaro has helped me recognise these urges for what they are and fight them. With the right mindset, and some willpower, it can change your life. But if you treat it only as an appetite suppressant, eating the same junk you always did, just less of it because you get full faster and aren't as hungry,   you‚Äôre setting yourself up to regain the weight as soon as you stop. 
 
I titrated up just because all the information I could find on mounjaro said that 5mg is considered the minimum 'therapeutic dose' ...

In Mounjaro‚Äôs clinical protocols:

2.5 mg ‚Üí purely an initiation dose, not intended for long-term efficacy. The aim is to reduce nausea, vomiting, and other GI side effects while your body adapts to tirzepatide.

5 mg ‚Üí the first maintenance dose where meaningful blood sugar control and weight loss effects are expected in most patients. Trials show that average appetite suppression, glucose improvement, and weight reduction ramp up significantly from this point.

So far, I've not noticed a difference, but it's early days. I'll continue with 5mg for a couple of months and see how I go. 

But to summarise, I've been on this for just over 2 months, I've made enormous changes to my diet, I pretty much only eat whole foods, have a protein shake instead of a coffee every morning,  weight train 4 times a week and so far have lost 1 stone 9lbs. So it definitely works. ",3,1754774128.0,mounjarouk,4,0.8,False

Be real,"When I was younger and still a virgin, I was in a relationship with a guy who pressured me into sex even though I wasn‚Äôt ready. I had a medical condition that made sex painful, and I told him this many times. He said I needed to be ‚Äúbroken in‚Äù so I wouldn‚Äôt feel the pain anymore.

He was very good at making it seem like he cared about what I was going through, but the pressure was constant and confusing. He once said, ‚ÄúIf the specialty coffee shop is closed,‚Äù basically meaning me because he thought I was very beautiful, ‚Äúthen you should go to the one that is cheaper but open.‚Äù In other words, if I wasn‚Äôt ready for sex, he could just find someone else ‚Äúeven if uglier‚Äù (in his words) who was.

Even though he kept saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to do this if you‚Äôre not ready,‚Äù the way he acted didn‚Äôt match his words. He pushed for sex and certain acts like backdoor sex, even when I said no. Sometimes during sex, he would ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù put it somewhere I didn‚Äôt want and keep going while I froze then would get angry if I would be upset about it saying I didnt say ‚Äúno‚Äù in the moment even though I would say it in the beginning and in the moment I would be too shocked to say anything. He would sometimes laugh when putting it in the wrong hole as if it was a joke and then continue pretending he was making the mistake 2 times, 3 times in a raw. 

Once during my period, he said vaginal sex was ‚Äúharam‚Äù because of his religion, but backdoor sex was allowed and when I said I dont think it is he lied about asking his spiritual coach about it. When I found out he lied to get what he wanted I cried so much.

Not to mention I would have backdoor sex because he would say manipulative things like ‚Äúyou know‚Ä¶sometimes you have some sexual things you like that if your partner doesnt fulfil you always wonder how it would be like to do it‚Äù (implying it makes someone want to cheat)

Now that I‚Äôm older, I‚Äôm trying to understand if this counts as sexual abuse or coercion. Was I being pressured beyond consent? Or am I misreading what happened? I would appreciate any insight.

***Part 6: Mikhail***

16 consonants, 6 vowel sounds, and 3 more vowel repetitions.¬†

Finally, after three weeks of planning mapping and listening and re-listening to audio, they did it. The three linguists had come up with a proper alphabet for the new alien language, and all of it written down with glorious roman letters. All save for one.¬†

The mysterious consonant that no one in attendance could replicate with a romance letter, which could only be described as a mix between a ‚Äúclick‚Äù and a ‚Äútrill.‚Äù One man had said it sounded like a kiss, and with that, and the fact that they were very clearly trilling the sound, Mikhail had come up with a brilliant idea. Take the kiss consonant symbol found in many sub-Saharan African languages, and simply multiply it, replacing the regular kiss continent with the many eyed seraph glyph from ancient Cyrillic, which lives on today in coding, since the many eyed seraph looks like a multitude of kiss of consonants.

With this, the 25 letter alphabet could finally be used to transcribe the alien language. Yet even after all this work, they still had one big hurdle; they simply did not know what they were saying.¬†

Context clues could help, but context isn‚Äôt everything. There simply weren't enough examples to draw from, there was no Rosetta Stone, and no live speakers on hand despite what America had claimed.¬†

The official story was that there was an alien, held hostage, that America was using as leverage and gaining various bits of information from. In reality, with the unrestricted access of information, the boys had learned that there was no alien; it had escaped, and no one knew where it had gone or what it was doing.¬†

With that sobering revelation, and the bitter sweet taste of victory in mind, Mikhail drinks his fourth glass of water. He wasn‚Äôt a drinker, they weren‚Äôt allowed alcohol in the slightest, nothing that they would be able to use to inebriate themselves, keep them from thinking right, so he drank lots of water to pass the time and make up for the years he spent drinking nothing but soda. It's in this state that Andrew finds him.¬†

‚ÄúHey dude, you feeling alright?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHuh? yeah, what is it?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ nothin‚Äô. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.‚Äù¬†

Mikhail perked up immediately. anything to distract him from what to do next. ‚ÄúSure, man, whatever you wanna do.‚Äù¬†

The two men walk Mikhail with his water and Andrew with his coffee.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little too quiet around here. Haven‚Äôt had much to do since last week, gets easy to lose track of things if you can‚Äôt keep busy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know what you mean, how have you two been while i was working.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, Dan's been napping the hours away, and I've been networking. What‚Äôve you been working on? We haven't got nothin‚Äô left to do since we finished up with that alphabet.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have looked into the individual words they say and am trying to figure out how they use them in a sentence‚Ä¶ Wait, networking??? With who? Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúLuis Ortiz in B-23. Y‚Äôknow, the botanist.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, so you were just chatting.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile on the job, making connections with others of a different field is called ‚Äúnetworking,‚Äù but yes we‚Äôve been having some riveting conversations these past few days.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what have you learned with all this ‚Äúnetworking?‚Äù‚Äù

‚ÄúI found out that Luis‚Äôs abuela is on life support. She was one of the victims of Vegas.""

‚ÄúOh! Oh God, that's terrible.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, they found her about the same time they found Miller. She was alive, but feverish and sick from all the carnage around her, plus she‚Äôd had a weak heart, she collapsed from an attack in the first minutes of the invasion. She got a shock from an AED but it didn‚Äôt help much‚Ä¶ anyway‚Ä¶ she was an organ donor, catholic lady, y‚Äôknow? A fucking nun, ain't that sum shit. Doctors want to pull the plug so they can start, y‚Äôknow, *donating* and‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ Luis has to sign off on it.‚Äù

They passed by room B-23, a sign labeled ‚ÄúBOTANISTS‚Äù stamped on the door. Mikhail looked in, but he didn‚Äôt see any sign of him. ‚ÄúLord almighty.‚Äù

The two passed the astronomy and pathology labs; Andrew turning into the historiography lab, motioned for Mikhail to follow. ‚ÄúNetworking‚Äù he mouthed.¬†

Inside were two men: a large brown gentleman with glasses and gray hair reading a book (in general looking the way that Mikhail had felt), and a short person‚Ä¶¬†

*Tim Dahle.* Mikhail realized. *‚ÄúYup, the foremost expert in studying human history‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt make it to this little hoedown with us. So we're bringing in his midget friend. Apparently he‚Äôs just as good.‚Äù* Richard Graebner‚Äôs words echoed in Mikhail‚Äôs mind. *Tactless as ever.*¬†

Professor Dahle stood on a stool and squeaked his easy erase marker against the whiteboard with feverish intensity. Mikhail said nothing at first, he just looked at the whiteboard. It was a timeline, one which stretched back millions of years, but it really got going around the middle between then and now with the modern day. Mikhail couldn‚Äôt see it all, but he did see the first section.

2 Million BC: Homo erectus.

2 Million BC: Control of fire.

800,000 BC: Bottleneck event.

400,000 BC: Homo Sapien.

90,000BC: Atlantis???

16,500BC: Sahara becomes a desert.

9,600BC: Jericho built.

9,000 BC: Creation of alcohol.

6,000BC: Writing invented.

2,600 BC: PYRAMIDS!!!

On and on, he wrote.

‚ÄúDamn, Doc, looks like you're onto something!‚Äù Andrew mused.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not‚Äù Buddy Bailey, he preferred if people call him ‚ÄúBailey‚Äù, chipped in. ‚ÄúHe revised that timeline hours ago, he hasn‚Äôt made any changes to it since then. He‚Äôs just going through the motions at this point.‚Äù

Andrew seems to have just noticed Bailey sitting there. ‚Äú‚ÄòEy what‚Äôs up, my bruthuh.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI am not your brother.‚Äù Bailey looks up, his bifocals resting at the edge of his nose, he sniffs before continuing. ‚ÄúI am a professor at Brown. You learn languages by watching Chinese cartoons.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOK, ah‚Äôright.‚Äù Andrew‚Äôs smile never left him, but he did turn away as he nodded his head, deciding instead to turn to Mikhail. Old Bailey went back to his book.

Mikhail for his part looked at the small pulp novel that Bailey was reading from. ‚ÄúWhat book is that?‚Äù¬†

Old Bailey didn‚Äôt look up from the novel. ‚ÄúShadow of the hegemon, not one of Card‚Äôs best endeavors. One can view his mental deterioration in real time the further you go into the Ender Wiggin saga.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs interesting. You know, I published a few books myself.‚Äù¬†

Old Bailey glanced at Mikhail before going back to the novel. ‚ÄúAh, the new linguist, yes? no doubt you‚Äôve put Con-Langs of your own into them, perhaps some fantasy novel or pseudo-historical epic? Apologies, but they‚Äôre not exactly my style. History is my job; any chance that I can, I prefer to read more science fiction related media.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúActually all of my books are sci-fi.‚Äù¬†

At this, Bailey pushed his glasses up to view Mikhail with new eyes. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ it can‚Äôt be worse than this.‚Äù He closed the old yellow book and placed it down. ‚ÄúPlace it on my desk, and I‚Äôll give it a look.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAll right, it‚Äôs a deal.‚Äù Mikhail smiled for the first time in a while.



As Tim Dale erased the timeline from the board and began from scratch once again, Andrew turned his head, beginning to read the timeline for himself.¬†

‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ Fire was invented before humans?‚Äù

‚ÄúWha-? no! You don‚Äôt *invent* fire, fire was already-‚Äù Tim gave an exasperated moan. ‚ÄúWhatever, nevermind! Yes, fire was *cultivated* by homo erectus long before humans. We‚Äôve been cooking our food before there was an ‚Äúus‚Äù to begin with.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn‚Ä¶ so you must have a pretty good idea about what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù¬†

Tim Dale looked at him for a moment then continued squeaking.¬†

‚ÄúAtlantis, huh? I gotta admit, I‚Äôve only really heard a few things about it. Truth be told, I didn‚Äôt even know that was a real place.¬†

The historian sighed. ‚ÄúBy all accounts it‚Äôs a made up land, along with multiple other places like Mu, Thule, or Avalon. But like all of those places, the possibility that they could just be other planets, or other lands on other planes or dimensions, well‚Ä¶ the possibility shouldn‚Äôt go overlooked, even if it‚Äôs highly unlikely.

‚ÄúPlato first mentioned Atlantis in his book on the republic. He talked about how he had gone to Egypt, and learned from the Egyptians an ancient account of an invasion that happened 90,000 years ago. this was before mankind had entered Europe mind you, at that point it was still just populated by Neanderthals; around this time the goat was being domesticated. The Egyptians still spun a yarn about how there was an ancient war with the people called the Atlanteans, or the Egyptian version of that name.¬†

‚ÄúThere was an island called Atlantis just off the coast of the Iberian peninsula it was massive and it was incredibly opulent and it decided to go to war with everyone else but an ancient Athenian army resisted the Atlanteans and eventually the gods saw all of this fighting and decided to put an end to it by sinking Atlantis the Atlanteans all died and the island of Atlantis was never seen from again.‚Äù

‚ÄúOK‚Ä¶‚Äù Andrew nodded his head. ‚ÄúCool, what does that have to do with the aliens?‚Äù¬†

Timothy‚Äôs head dipped, the marker fell from his hand. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù he shook his head ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know what the hell they expected from me. They‚Äôre like little‚Ä¶ goblin people from another dimension, or from a lightning bolt in the middle of the fucking Mojave. What am I supposed to get from that! Oh they‚Äôre really small, and they can do magic. Yeah, that *really* narrows it down, doesn‚Äôt it?! It‚Äôs not like every single culture on this planet has some form of folklore about little men that like to pull pranks involving magic!‚Äù Timothy began to storm off, forgetting that he was on a stool.¬†

Falling backwards and collapsing on the ground, he didn‚Äôt move for a full ten count. He just shook his head while looking at the ceiling. ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt even be here, man. I shouldn‚Äôt fucking be here. Why‚Ä¶? Why did he do it?¬†

‚Äúwhy did who do what?‚Äù Andrew bent down his hands prepared to help Tim somehow. He froze. *Am I allowed to pick up a little person if it meant they could get back on their feet, or do I just hold out his hand so that they can help themselves up? What was the etiquette here?*

‚ÄúChase‚Ä¶ you asshole‚Ä¶ you just had to throw yourself to the wolves, didn‚Äôt you? Sure, throw your life away and leave me with the goddamn world on my shoulders. Dumbass‚Ä¶ Fucking dumbass‚Ä¶‚Äù the words were harsh, but they were also strained his eyes were shining, squinting, tears began to fall from them. His hands cover his face as he begins convulse silently.¬†

‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ Hey, dude‚Ä¶‚Äù Andrew settled on putting a hand on his shoulder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get through this, dog, you‚Äôre not alone. If you need anyone to talk to, there's me, my buddy Mike, and‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ Bailey seems nice enough.‚Äù he quieted down for that last part. ‚ÄúListen, we got two months, all right? two months to figure all this out. That's more than enough time to narrow it down.¬†

‚ÄúNow‚Ä¶ you said that every culture on earth, or at the very least most of them have some myths and legends about tiny dudes, right?¬†

Tim wipes the tears from his face and, dignified as he can, nods his head as he slowly blinks the puffiness out of his eyes. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ Africa, Europe, Japan, China, we even have Native American myths about it. I want to think that because they invaded us from New Mexico that might mean the Navajo myths about little people might be correct, or in some way have a modicum of truth to them. But I‚Äôm not so sure.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOK, you‚Äôre not so sure. why?‚Äù¬†

Tim looked at him skeptically, then began his explanation. ‚ÄúYou know those classified files that they released to the public?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah of course‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThere's a German museum that has an artifact that they found in 1977. A sarcophagus deep within Kleine Feldhofer Grotte; within it they found a sword in a considerable state of decay inside of sludge and wrappings that they found to be the remains of dead bodies. Apparently it was a burial mound of some kind, so the decay of the bodies also was held into question. They carbon dated the sword, carbon dated the liquefied remains, carbon dated‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ basically everything. But no matter what they tested, the readings that they found didn‚Äôt make any sense to them.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat were the ratings?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell carbon-14 has a half-life of fifty-seven hundred years and the manufacture of steel was first introduced in Eight hundred BC at the earliest. but when they carbon dated the, very much *steel,* sword and the sarcophagus, they found that both had been created by an early European craftsman of some kind‚Ä¶ nearly 30,000 years ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, that's older than all the languages that I know. What does that tell us?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt tells us that there was a European bastard sword made from steel that was used by a Neanderthal human hybrid dozens of millennia before the creation of steel became mainstream. There are several theories as to how it happened or how that was possible the sword was taken into the German museum and has since been given the title ‚Äúthe sword of Solomon‚Äù since that was the name etched into the side of the sword in occitan, which originated only a couple hundred years ago, and was given a date which better reflected that origin. stating that the sword was actually 30,000 years old would, of course, raise way too many eyebrows. But now everyone in this room knows about it, and everyone out there probably knows about it too if they decided to look into it.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWelp‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a little weird‚Ä¶ kind of spooky. y‚Äôknow, now that I think about it. What does that say about‚Ä¶ anything?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt says that aliens aren‚Äôt the only things that we could be contending with, time travel is also a possibility. I don‚Äôt know how or why, but if the findings of that crew were correct these things could not only be coming from us from another place, they could also be coming to us from the future, or worse the far distant past. Meaning *they* could be a lot more advanced than us, or we could end up giving them some of *our* technology and they would be able to reverse engineer it, changing *their* past; granting them technology thousands of years more advanced than our own. If the military raiding parties continue we could-!‚Äù

‚ÄúWoah, hold on!‚Äù Andrew made a T symbol with his hands. ‚ÄúYou're jumping to a lot of conclusions real quick. There are no alien spaceships, and all we needed to do was gun them down and they died immediately. If anything you‚Äôre giving them a little too much credit, so let‚Äôs go back to the basics. Sure time travel is also a possibility now, but space travel is what‚Äôs important.¬†

‚ÄúThe astronomer guys read the stars, read the atmospheric conditions, and eventually they found no link between earth and‚Ä¶ whatever they're calling it, in their night sky. Meaning they‚Äôre coming at us from a separate galaxy entirely. They are hundreds of thousands of light-years away from us.¬†

‚ÄúNow of the fake landscapes that you know about, which ones are described as having eternal evenings or night time?‚Äù

Tim Dahle raised his arms. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. There's eternal sunshine on some of them, but no eternal night. the ones that do have eternal night, well‚Ä¶ nothing else really matches, especially not the little people or ‚Äúelf‚Äù scenarios. I don't know‚Ä¶‚Äù Tim Dale resets his stool and climbs back on. He marks the rest of his timeline the way that he had before.

This time Andrew looks over each piece of information as they come up. Most of the concepts fly over his head, but he decides to keep a few words of importance in his skull just in case they decide to have a conversation about it later.

Eventually, Tim Dahle completes it again, but this time he doesn‚Äôt pick up the eraser. He keeps his marker and places it down and sighs one last time. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing that again, I promise.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúEy, man. You don‚Äôt gotta promise me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm promising to myself.‚Äù Tim Dahle walks over to Mikhail and wraps his knuckles against the side of his waist.¬†

The linguist turns, confused.¬†

‚ÄúHey, pally, you mind passing me the remote?‚Äù¬†

Mikhail blinks before checking surroundings and finding the TV with a remote placed on top of it. ‚ÄúOh! Sure, man! Go for it!‚Äù He dutifully hands the short person his remote and steps aside.¬†

Old Baily yawns before putting in a bookmark and placing his reading material by his side. Seems he won‚Äôt get any reading done. Like professor Dahle, he had been stuck in a loop. He had been reading the exact same line over and over and over again, and had finally given up; Instead deciding to fold his hands and place them on his stomach silently watching as his colleague changed the channel to the news.

Mikhail sighed.¬†

‚ÄúOh no, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù the short professor asked. ‚ÄúNot a fan of CNN?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that, it‚Äôs just that all anyone wants to talk about right now is the elves.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell of course everyone wants to talk about it. this is the most substantial thing that‚Äôs happened to the human race in thousands of years of written history.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI know, but it‚Äôs exhausting. Every time I go on my phone, every single time I go on social media, I can‚Äôt escape this. it‚Äôs everywhere. it‚Äôs all anyone has been talking about. I‚Äôve been watching year old YouTube videos for days just to escape it. It's kind of getting boring if I‚Ä¶‚Äù He trails off, looking at the headline.¬†

Everyone was silent as they watched the report go by.¬†

‚ÄúIt seems that something has been placed on the other side of the bridge.‚Äù The silver haired anchor went pale. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt there when we sent the drones in, but the moment a living human being stepped out, *it* appeared along with the smell of rotten eggs. Most of the soldiers have been killed in action or been presumed dead due to lack of evidence to the contrary. Their families were notified of the losses this morning. Right now, we would like to mourn the tragic loss of these brave men, and the veteran among them. Chase Miller; son of Troy Miller, the officer who gave his life to give humanity an early warning against the threat from beyond the stars.‚Äù

Mikhail and Andrew looked at Professor Dahle. His eyes were blank, his expression tired, his gaze 1000 yards away. He shook his head again. ‚ÄúBastard‚Ä¶‚Äù He whispers. ‚ÄúYou stupid bastard.‚Äù

***Memory Transcription Subject: Unknown UN Ambassador.***

""What do you mean by Arxur raids? I made sure to get my fleets to back off!"" A growl came through the voice call.

Things weren't looking good for the UN as a whole, the ambassador from BRICS+ accidentally mentioned the Arxur while he was speaking with Tyvil, and *boy*, was Tyvil *pissed*. Now, we had to somehow get whoever was attacking the remainder of the Venlil colonies to stop or the deal we had with the Venlil Republics was off.

Problem was, it wasn't Isif behind the attacks, it was one of his supposed 'colleagues'. But apparently, he wasn't in a mood to talk about it for some reason. I had been talking with him for the past 10 minutes or so, explaining the situation that led to our new predicament.

""Look, I'm not accusing you, someone else is attacking the northwest part of the Venlil Republics. But it isn't you, at least I hope it isn't.""

There was a brief period of silence, and I heard what I'm pretty sure was a sigh on the other side of the call.

""Northwest, you say? I think I know who's responsible for the attacks, problem is, I'm not sure *they* will obey a request of mine, we Arxur believe in shows of force or equal exchanges, but right now, I can't re-""

""The UN will double the amount of food supplies we are giving you *weekly* for the rest of the *month*, free of charge.""

""-ally keep myself from helping you. The name of the Chief Hunter that works on that part of Venlil territory is Shaza, though I doubt she would stop her fleets from raiding Venlil colonies for cattle. Unlike my workers and I, the Arxur living in her sector are much more brutal, they *do* regularly eat sapient beings.""

""Do you think a show of force on our part would be enough to get them to back off?""

Another moment of silence followed.

""Honestly? I don't think you should attempt to do that, she's the type of leader to report anything suspicious to the higher-ups, in this case, to the Arxur Dominion, and it would *definitely* not end well. I will get her to stop, in return, you keep you promise of doubling the amount of food you send us temporarily, yes?""

""Alright, I will get in contact with my higher-ups, and also, one last thing.""

""Hm?""

""Can you send me a document regarding how the fleets working for her operate?""

""...Sure. Why, though?""

""My superiors asked me not to tell anyone about it, sorry.""

""...Fair enough, but *if* your plans involve attacking them, *please* do inform me beforehand.""

""Sure thing. Don't worry. Alright, I need to go now, I have other things to do.""

""Alright, if you need anything else, please consider contacting me.""

And with that, he ended the meeting.

It was a blessing that I had managed to get him to send me that document in under half an hour. Otherwise, I would be unable to keep up with my schedule...

=================================================================

***Memory Transcription Subject: Kam, Venlil War Advisor.***

There were two things that had made my current shift a mess.

The first problem was that the humans apparently were speaking with the *Arxur* of all people. Well, it wasn't like they had really any friends in the galaxy beside us, but still... At least they were willing to help us with the Arxur attacks in the northwest part of our territory, and that takes us to the second thing that's been ruining my *day.*

How was I going to get the humans and our special forces to work together in a cattle rescue mission? Especially when the humans themselves couldn't be seen by those they were supposed to be saving?

It was a mess, plotting up a strategy with raiding forces I've never seen in action before was going to be difficult. At least on my side it was going to be. The UN had invited Tyvil to send a few of our boarding squads to Earth in order to train with them to better work together, it was clear that they fully intended on having a squad of their own work with ours if it became necessary, not that any of us wanted it to happen, but cattle rescue missions were always very dangerous and risky to execute, even more than now our forces would be acting on their own without support from the Federation.

So here I was, waiting for Vyly and a few members of his crew in order to explain to them what they were going to do. They've only *worked* with human ships, but never actually engaged in combat alongside them. But Tyvil decided they would be the best suited for the job, since they were, so far, the *only* fleet that knew about humanity. And the less knew about Earth for now, the better.

Barely a few *minutes* later, there was a knock on the door of my office, I quickly ordered them to enter.

Vyly came in with 4 others of his crew, a Gojid, a Yotul, and two other Venlil.

""You asked for my presence, sir?"" He spoke up.

""Yes, I did, indeed, I called you in order to give you and your boarding squadrons a special assignment. You will be going to Earth in order to train with our new allies.""

Everyone on the room except for him immediately stiffened.

""D-did you say Earth?"" The Yotul behind Vyly asked.

""Your heard me, the UN asked us to send a few of our boarding squadrons to practice a few boarding exercises with their own troops. They believe that it will be very necessary for our armies to be able to fight alongside each other in the future, and Tyvil agreed, he appointed you and your crew for the job. We don't want words about Earth to spread across our personnel, and since you were the only fleet to have worked with them so far, you were chosen.""

I pulled a paper from one of the piles in my desk and handed it over to Vyly.

You are to take your boarding squads, *and they only*, to Earth in one of your vessels, when you drop outside of Sol, *announce* your presence in the specified frequency, your name, as well as your reason for visit, the last thing I want is them to mistaking you for an enemy and pulverizing you with a rocket gun shell. If everything goes well, they will open a path for your ship across their anti-subspace buoys that will allow you to go directly to the vicinities of their Space Elevator.""

""How long will we be there, sir?"" He asked.

""Two *days* or more, I'm not sure, it will be dependant on your performance during training. They are expecting you to arrive there *tomorrow*. Do **not** mess this up, you understand?""

He flicked his tail. ""Alright, lets go, boys, time to get to work, I guess.""

""One last thing."" I spoke up again, causing him to look back.

""The humans will be sending a squad of their own back with you, they want to participate in a cattle raid mission to better understand how you act during actual combat, if all goes well, they will only be present in the bridge with you, but if things take a turn for worse, they want to be able to intervene. Can you do that?""

He reluctantly flicked his tail, ""I will figure something out sir, don't worry about that.""

He then left, the squad that was with him following suit.

I then moved to call Nikolai, I had to inform the UN that the personnel we would be sending to Earth were on their way. There was also the matter regarding Tyvil's request on the attacks on the northwest part of our borders, if Nikolai had spoken the truth regarding the supposed 'leader' of the Arxur in our region, then there was hope to keep our population safe. I hoped that if blood had to be spilled, it would be from those *heartless* monsters.

A good few *minutes* went by before Nikolai answered my voice call.

""Nikolai speaking, how can I help you?""

""Hello Nikolai, it's me, Kam. I wanted to tell you that the boarding squads the UN had asked us to send to you are on their way, they will probably arrive on the border of your home system tomorrow. Did you guys install the docking adapter on your Space Elevator?""

""Oh, hello Kam, how are you? They are installing the adapter right now, it should be fully installed in a few *hours,* don't worry about that. And also, there's also some *cool* technology that I bet you Venlil would like to know about, problem is that I would need an ambassador here to discuss details, can that be arranged?""

""What would the technology be? Our soldiers don't need *much* as of right now outside of new ships and more training.""

""Have you heard about [active camouflage](https://alexcox245.medium.com/chameleon-clothing-efd8fd81d823), Kam?"" *{*[*second*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_camouflage#Military_prototypes)*,* [*third* ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/edf-2022-ls-ra-dis-ac)*and* [*fourth* ](https://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-01/active-camouflage-system-uses-e-ink-make-tanks-invisible-battlefield/)*link to active camouflage here}*

""I have, I know about it, we never developed it a lot, though, there simply wasn't a reason to do so. Why?""

""What if we were to equip *your* armored vehicles and military troops with a system that automatically blends in with the surrounding environment? Would that be useful for you to defend colonies?""

I paused. ""What would be the catch? I'm not expecting you to hand us the technology free of charge.""

""Nope, free of charge, it would benefit us a lot more in the long run, and besides, Tyvil wants us to increase the amount of factories here on Sol working for the Venlil Republics. That will be the payment, don't worry, I've already spoken with my superiors, they're content with that, it's standard tech to us anyway, and since we're partnerning up with you, we kinda need you to be able to camouflage well, too.""

...*He had a point, their camouflage would be of no use if our troops that were with them weren't blended in with them...*

""I assume that you will need the measurements of our uniforms, I will send them to you, then, this technology will be *insanely* useful for us. Thank you for giving it to us.""

""Don't worry about it, our species are allies, and that's what allies do, right?""

""No, giving others their technology free of charge only happened once or twice in the Federation as far as I know.""

""Ehm, well, we need you to be roughly on par with us, can't leave our friends behind technologically, can we?""

I sighed, these humans are way too innocent sometimes...

""May I ask you a last question?""

""Go ahead.""

""Does the UN intend to retrieve Karl when you eventually land a ship here in Venlil Prime at some point in the future?""

There was a long moment of silence. For a brief moment, I thought I said something I shouldn't have.

""That will be entirely dependant on whether *he* wants to come back to Earth or not. At least from what Gustavo has told me and Noah in the past, Karl always liked to explore, he's still sending back new data from the light facing side of your planet, after all, I would need to consult on Gustavo or call Karl directly, but I assure you, if he wanted to return, he would've told Mission Control a long time ago.

I do expect him to want to explore the twilight and night zones of your planet eventually, however, but that would require him to receive an overhaul on his systems as well as some modifications, though I'm sure you guys *could* do it yourselves, were we to give you the blueprints and the parts. But I'm afraid that will take some time for that to happen, Karl is probably still in good shape, since he was made with durability and reliability in mind.

And our scientists have yet to find a power source for the exoskeletons that they intend to use on a trip to your planet, they will also need an implant to help with the additional workload on the heart. So a visit won't be happening anytime soon. At least until we deal with the Federation, that is.

Anything else? I'm in a tight schedule here.""

""No, thanks for your attention, see you later, I guess.""

""Alright, see ya.""

Things were going in apparently a good direction for now, at least...

It all started this morning when my girlfriend and I got into a¬†*nuclear*¬†fight over something stupid, honestly, I don‚Äôt even remember what it was about now, but it ended with her calling me ""emotionally incompetent"" (her favorite insult) and me slamming the door hard enough to rattle the pictures on the wall.

At some point I thought: what if you could search by the meaning and emotions of the scene, not just keywords?

Right now I‚Äôm experimenting with an AI tool that tries to do exactly that - it ‚Äúreads‚Äù the full script or scene description and pulls visuals from multiple sources (AI-generated, stock libraries, even live web content) that match the emotional and story context, not just literal keywords.

So far, it can:

 ‚Ä¢ Analyze the plot and detect emotional tone

 ‚Ä¢ Search across multiple sources, not just stock sites

 ‚Ä¢ Filter out irrelevant stuff and give a top 10 of the most fitting results

It‚Äôs still early, and there‚Äôs a lot left to do (for example, I want it to understand the pacing and story arcs, not just standalone scenes).

As someone who‚Äôs constantly hopping between tasks and locations during the day, I needed a laptop that could keep up without having to lug around a giant power brick. This Chromebook certainly appears to fit the bill‚Äîand after a few weeks of testing, it‚Äôs been both a win and a bit of a ‚Äúcould‚Äôve done better‚Äù situation.

**Compact and Lightweight Design**

Carrying this Chromebook around feels effortless. Weighing in at just 0.634 ounces and with dimensions of 12.85 x 8.94 x 0.72 inches, it fits snugly in my bag without taking up too much space. The black finish gives it a sleek, understated look‚Äînothing flashy, but still professional enough to use for client meetings or casual coffee shop work sessions. I did notice that the build feels somewhat plasticky, particularly around the keyboard area, but considering the price range, it‚Äôs not too surprising. The display bezel, while not the slimmest I‚Äôve seen, doesn‚Äôt feel outdated, so that‚Äôs a win.

**Everyday Performance and Task Handling**

Equipped with the Intel Celeron N4120 processor and 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, I was curious about how it would handle my daily workflow. Good news: it sails smoothly through light tasks like web browsing, email replies, Google Docs editing, and video calls. The inclusion of Intel UHD Graphics 600 made casual streaming on platforms like Netflix and YouTube relatively satisfying, though it‚Äôs clearly not built for visually demanding work like Photoshop or video editing. Where it starts to stutter is when I push it too far with 15+ Chrome tabs and a couple of apps open. That‚Äôs when I hear the tiny fans working a bit harder. Still, if you stick to light-to-moderate tasks, it‚Äôs reliable.

[Check HP 14 Chromebook price on Amazon.](https://multipowers.com/p/b0c8171gtk/)

**Battery Is a Beast**

To say the battery life is impressive would be an understatement. With up to 14 hours advertised, I‚Äôve consistently hit around 12 hours of mixed usage before needing to plug it in. That‚Äôs rare in this price bracket! On days when I needed it for nonstop Zoom calls, it managed to hold up for a full workday. One caveat: streaming video and running at max brightness cuts the battery life down by a couple of hours. But hey, isn‚Äôt that the case with almost every laptop out there?

**HD Display: Functional, Not Wow-Worthy**

The 14-inch HD screen boasts a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels with touch-enabled micro-edge and anti-glare features. I‚Äôm torn on this screen. It‚Äôs fine for most tasks, from browsing to streaming, and the anti-glare quality does make it usable in sunny spaces, which is a godsend for outdoor work. However, if you‚Äôre someone who values razor-sharp details or crisper colors, the lower resolution may leave you unimpressed. My coworker even squinted when I showed her a PowerPoint presentation on it, but truth be told, if you‚Äôre not a pixel perfectionist, it does get the job done.

**Highlights**

- Lightweight and portable: perfect for travelers, students, and professionals on the go.
- Long battery life that supports all-day usage.
- Fast and reliable performance for basic work tasks and light entertainment.
- Plenty of port options, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and even a headphone jack.

**Areas of Concern**

- Screen resolution could be better, especially if working with detailed visuals.
- 4GB of RAM limits multitasking when handling multiple memory-intensive apps or browser tabs.
- Build quality could feel sturdier for the long haul.

**Beyond Chrome OS: Ease of Use**

Running on Chrome OS, this Chromebook brings simplicity to its peak. Operating it feels intuitive, fast, and yes, very Google-centric. If you live in the Google ecosystem‚ÄîCalendar, Gmail, Docs‚Äîyou‚Äôll feel right at home. Installing Android apps expands its usability even more. From Spotify to Slack, everything synced up without a hitch. However, if you need non-Google-specific software, this could give you some roadblocks, especially if you‚Äôre used to traditional laptops.

**Competitive Options**

Compared to rivals like Lenovo‚Äôs IdeaPad Flex 3 or the Acer Chromebook Spin 311, this Chromebook manages to hold its ground. The HP shines with its robust battery life and slightly larger screen but falls short in areas like screen resolution and multitasking efficiency. Lenovo‚Äôs model adds a touchscreen that feels snappier, while Acer pushes its convertible build, making it more versatile for tablet lovers. Personally, HP‚Äôs straightforward, no-frills approach fits my needs better, but for creative workers or hardcore multitaskers, one of its rivals might suit you more.

**Best Value**

For the price, this Chromebook packs a punch. Affordable without losing out on significant performance, it‚Äôs a great pick for students, budget-conscious techies, or as a secondary device for quick tasks. The long-lasting battery alone provides excellent bang for the buck. While it‚Äôs not the laptop you‚Äôd use to edit that Hollywood blockbuster, it handles the basics beautifully.

All Will Be Gone, Ex
""I never loved you.""The words shattered her world.
Felton thought she would beg
Instead, Anastasia packed her bags, left the divorce papers on the table, and walked away‚Äîwithout a word.
This wasn‚Äôt the end.It was the beginning.
Anastasia is done playing the good wife.Now, she plays to win.
Her real name? Anastasia Carny-an heiress with wealth, power, and a new agenda.
Now she‚Äôs back, a soft smile on her lips and a dagger behind her back.
Felton still thinks she belongs to him.Still believes he‚Äôs in control.
Until he realizes the one signing his paychecks is the ex-wife.

Chapter 1 Divorce
""Let's just end this. I never loved you.""
Felton Gutierrez set the divorce papers on the table, his expression cold.
Anastasia Carney sat on the couch across from him. Her heart sank as she looked at the papers.
Seeing she wasn't moving, Felton stood up and looked down at her.
""Anastasia, are you deaf or what?"" he snapped.
That was how he talked to her all along, always sharp and cutting.
She suppressed the bitterness in her heart and picked up the pen from the table. Without hesitation, she signed her name.
Felton sneered.
Anastasia handed him the papers, but just as his fingers touched them, she yanked them back and ripped them in half.
""What the hell are you doing?"" His lips pressed into a thin line, eyes blazing with fury.
""You never loved me. So why did you marry me?"" Anastasia looked right at him, the man she had loved with all her heart for three years.
""Just needed a tool,"" he replied with a sneer.
His voice was ice cold, and the words cut deep, pulling Anastasia into the depths of despair.
She let out a dry laugh, and the sadness in her eyes faded. Then she teased, ""You're rushing this divorce because Raquel Fletcher is back, right?""
Raquel was his unforgettable love, the girl who once saved his life.
Years ago, when Felton had just taken over the Gutierrez Group, his enemies set him up. The car accident left him paralyzed from the waist down.
The second Raquel heard about it, she called off their engagement and fled abroad. Just like that, she cut him off completely and disappeared without a trace.
Paralyzed and abandoned, Felton was devastated. His grandmother couldn't watch him fall apart, so she found Anastasia, hoping her presence could heal Felton.
When Anastasia mentioned Raquel, Felton finally lost his cool.
""Shut up! You don't get to say her name!
""If you hadn't schemed against her, she never would have left. We would have been married by now.""
His eyes blazed with rage as he yelled.
""You seriously think I made her leave you?"" Anastasia scoffed.
""Who else could it be?""
After a dry laugh, Anastasia walked into the bedroom. When she came back, she had a suitcase and a small gift box with her.
She opened the box. Inside was a sleek black wristwatch.
Felton recognized it immediately‚Äîan Opuluxe limited edition, designed by Myrtle, the only one in the world.
He had tried to order it once but failed. How the hell did she get it?
Before he could ask about it, Anastasia held it up and let it drop. The watch shattered against the floor with a sharp clink.
""This was supposed to be your anniversary gift. But you don't deserve it anymore!"" Anastasia snarled.
Felton's face darkened.
Anastasia ignored him. She turned, opened a drawer, and pulled out another copy of the divorce papers.
The bold red letters on the cover stood out.
""Look, I'm divorcing you. Not the other way around! Goodbye for good, Felton!""
Chapter 2 She's Gone
Anastasia chucked the divorce papers right in Felton's face, grabbed her suitcase, and walked out.
Felton stood there, stunned. By the time he snapped out of it, she was already gone.
Scowling, he slammed his fist into the wall.
""Damn it. Damn you, Anastasia!""
She actually had the nerve to throw the papers in his face.
A Rolls-Royce parked not far away from the Gutierrez's villa.
Anastasia spotted the plate and smirked before heading over and sliding into the car.
""Welcome back, Anastasia,"" came a deep voice from the driver's seat.
Anastasia laughed and threw herself at the man. ""Big brother, I missed you!""
Hobert Carney ruffled her hair with a gentle smile. ""Want me to go teach that jerk a lesson?""
""Don't bother.""
Her voice was quiet, heavy. She sniffled and blinked back the tears before speaking again.
""From now on, I'm just a Carney. Felton's got nothing to do with me anymore.""
""Damn right. You're our little princess. He's not worth another second of your time.
""Dad and Deandre are waiting for you at home.""
As Hobert spoke, he gently wiped the tear from her eye.
The car started moving. Anastasia took one last look at the Gutierrez's villa, resolve flickering in her eyes.
""Goodbye, Felton. Three years down the drain,"" she thought.
At the villa, Felton couldn't stop thinking about Anastasia. He was starting to think he had lost his mind. His face was tense as he rubbed his throbbing forehead.
But her final words wouldn't leave his head.
He started to wonder if there was another reason Raquel had left back then.
Just as suspicion was gnawing at him, his phone rang.
He picked up. ""What is it?""
""Boss, Ms. Fletcher woke up but passed out again.""
Felton froze. Then he grabbed his coat and rushed out.
A few minutes later, he came to the VIP ward. He felt a twinge of guilt seeing the pale, unconscious woman lying in the bed.
He reached down, adjusted the blanket around her, and turned to his assistant, Arnoldo Wilson. ""What happened?"" he asked coldly.
""Ms. Fletcher woke up asking for you. I tried to calm her, but she got too worked up and passed out. The doctors checked her just now.
""Nothing serious. Just anemia from poor nutrition. That's why she is weak,"" Arnoldo explained, keeping his head down.
His silence sent a chill through Arnoldo.
Then he spoke. ""From now on, any updates about Raquel, you tell me right away.""
Arnoldo nodded, but something flickered across his face.
Felton caught it instantly. His brows pulled together. ""What else?""
""Well, it's about Ms. Carney.
""Everything about her, photos, records, anything online, it's all gone. Like she never existed,"" Arnoldo said.
Felton's eyes turned sharp. After a long pause, he said, ""Find out who did it.""
He had a gut feeling that Anastasia wasn't who she claimed to be.
Three days later, Quelston's business world was rocked by a bombshell.
Chapter 3 The Gala
BREAKING NEWS: ""Regent Entertainment has named a new CEO, but the identity remains a mystery. An exclusive gala will be held tonight at the Peninsula Hotel.""
The news sent the city into a frenzy. Reporters rushed to get the best coverage, camping outside the company headquarters for hours, hoping to catch a glimpse of this new CEO.
Inside Regent Entertainment, workers were buzzing with nervous excitement.
""I can't wait to see what he looks like.""
""I heard he's really handsome.""
""Shh! If the director hears us, we're getting another lecture.""
After a few more whispers, everyone scattered.
At the back, a woman walked out of the restroom, her face tight with resentment. She had given years to this company, only for someone else to take the CEO spot. Tonight, she would find out who it was.
As evening fell, the grand gala was about to begin.
At the entrance, the high-society crowd chatted and laughed. Their words held a quiet competition, with subtle jabs wrapped in polite compliments.
Then, a limited-edition Rolls-Royce pulled up, turning every head.
Everyone expected Regent Entertainment's new CEO, but when the car door opened, Felton stepped out with a woman few recognized. Felton exuded authority and refinement. The woman was stunning, though there was a fragile quality to her.
They looked like the perfect match.
The crowd murmured with curiosity.
""Isn't that Mr. Gutierrez? Who's the woman with him? His wife, the one he's supposedly been married to for three years?""
""Nah. I saw his wife once; she's a total knockout. This one... she's gorgeous, but something feels off. Like she's missing something..."" The man suddenly went quiet, sensing a glare.
He looked up, meeting Raquel's hostile stare, and shut up fast.
Felton heard the comment but only gave a slight frown.
His reaction disappointed Raquel. She clenched her jaw and then leaned into him. ""Felty, my feet hurt,"" she murmured sweetly.
He pulled her into his arms and said softly, ""Just hang in there a little longer. We'll head home right after we meet the new CEO.""
""Okay.""
She knew better than to push. Felton liked her, not just because she had once saved his life, but because she never questioned what he chose to keep to himself.
Their intimacy drew envious glances from the young women nearby.
""They look so in love. It's unreal,"" one said.
""Watching them makes me want my own perfect romance. Where is my Prince Charming?"" another asked.
Raquel heard the murmurs and lifted her chin, smug.
She no longer cared that the Fletcher family refused to acknowledge her. Felton's heart was hers, and she was sure he would marry her soon.
Then, she would be the most respected woman in the city.
Just then, a stir in the crowd snapped her out of it.
A sleek black Maybach pulled up to the entrance.
Hobert stepped out first, cool and distant. Then he leaned in and offered a hand to his plus-one.
Felton froze the moment he saw the bracelet on her wrist‚Äîidentical to the one Anastasia used to wear.
Chapter 4 Steal the Spotlight
From the moment Felton realized the woman was Anastasia, he couldn't look away.
She had been missing for three days.
He had people searching everywhere, tried everything, but there was no sign of her.
At first, Felton thought she deserved something for all she had done for their marriage. But now, he wasn't sure.
He glanced at the man beside her, his expression darkening with scorn.
""No wonder I couldn't find her. She's already latched onto that guy. She hustled her way into the Gutierrez family. Of course, she's not gonna be easy,"" he thought darkly.
Many had been impressed by Raquel's looks, but the moment Anastasia showed up, all attention shifted to her.
Raquel struggled to keep her smile. She glanced at Felton, only to see he was still staring at Anastasia.
Raquel gave a soft laugh and put on an apologetic look. ""Felty, my feet are killing me. Can we move over there for a bit?""
Felton noticed the redness on her heels. He nodded and helped her toward the dessert table.
Hobert had been watching them. He nudged Anastasia's arm.
She gave them a glance, then went right back to her conversation with other guests.
Hobert sighed, thinking, ""Anastasia's great at a lot of things. Just not this. If I were her, seeing those two parading around like that, I'd have torn the place just to ruin their night.""
A man spotted Hobert and shoved through the crowd, gripping a microphone.
""Sir, are you the president of Falcon Group? What's your relationship with this lady?
""Are you the new CEO of Regent Entertainment?"" The man's voice shook with excitement.
""Excuse me,"" Hobert said, hesitating.
He was ready to brush it off, but the moment he locked eyes with Felton, he changed his mind. Then he shot Felton a sharp look.
""Her? Yeah, she's my girlfriend.""
The moment the words left Hobert's lips, the crowd lost it.
Someone screamed, ""Oh my god! Mr. Carney has a girlfriend!""
The noise finally got Anastasia's attention. She turned and stared into Hobert's face. ""What's going on?""
Hobert touched his nose, looking a little sheepish. ""Nothing. Just told them you're my girlfriend.""
She pinched his waist hard. ""Oh? You didn't tell me.""
Hobert winced, rubbing the sore spot, his eyes full of quiet pleading.
Felton watched them, his expression darkening.
Raquel hated that Anastasia kept the spotlight. So she swung her arm and knocked over a champagne glass.
The sharp crash snapped everyone's attention back to Raquel. She smiled and said softly, ""Oh no! I must've knocked it over by accident.""
Felton's frown eased. He took her hand, looking her over.
""You okay? Did you cut yourself?""
""I'm fine, Felty. Just the broken glass..."" She bit her lip, looking bothered, but there was a flicker of triumph in her eyes. Then she shot Anastasia a sharp look.
Chapter 5 Generous Offer
""It's fine,"" Felton said, cool and unbothered.
He then waved over a waiter to clean up the mess.
Anastasia noticed Raquel staring and smirked. She had thought years abroad would have made Raquel wiser. But clearly, Raquel was still as childish and clueless as ever.
The mess was cleaned up, and the gala carried on. Conversations picked up where they left off. Anastasia linked arms with Hobert and walked toward the dessert table. As she passed Felton and Raquel, she didn't even look at them, like they weren't there.
Felton watched her, expecting an explanation. But she wasn't going to give him one. His temple pulsed with frustration.
Raquel felt his shift in mood, and she wasn't happy. She shot Anastasia a glare, full of spite.
The gala went on as planned. Some businessmen recognized Hobert and came over, eager to talk shop.
The conversation quickly bored Anastasia. She leaned in, whispered to Hobert, then slipped away to a quiet corner for a drink.
Raquel had been watching. Seeing Anastasia alone, she decided to make her move. After some small talk and fake laughs with those ladies, she headed over.
Anastasia saw her but didn't react. She wanted to see what Raquel was up to.
""Ms. Carney. Long time no see.""
Raquel gave Anastasia a once-over, her eyes flickering with something close to admiration. Even she couldn't deny that Anastasia was stunning.
""Do you want something?"" Anastasia's tone was flat, clearly uninterested.
""Not really.
""Just... just thought we should clear the air about Felty. You know he loves me. Now that I'm back, he's gonna marry me. I just hope you're not planning to get in the way again, like you did three years ago,"" Raquel said.
Anastasia let out a laugh. Honestly, Raquel was hopeless.
""You and Felton could strip naked in bed for all I care. Instead of wasting your breath here, maybe focus on keeping his heart. Because ever since I showed up, he's looked at me more times than he has at you,"" Anastasia shot back.
She whipped her head around and saw Felton staring at Anastasia.
Her blood boiled.
She took out a Centurion Card from her bag and tossed it onto the floor. Whatever fake sweetness she had before was gone.
""There's 160 thousand dollars in that account. Take it and get the hell out of Quelston. Stay away from Felty,"" she hissed.
Anastasia clicked her tongue, clearly annoyed. She bent down, picked up the card, and gave it a long look.
Before Raquel could say anything snide, Anastasia snapped the card in half.
Raquel froze as the pieces hit the floor. Then Anastasia stepped on them twice.
Raquel's face went pale. It felt like Anastasia hadn't just stepped on the card but on her pride.
She held back her anger, but her voice was sharp. ""Why did you do that, Anastasia?
""160 thousand dollars. That's already generous. Don't push it.""
Chapter 6 The Fight
""That little bit of money? And you think you can tell me what to do with it?"" Anastasia shot back.
She let out a sharp laugh, pulled a plain-looking card from her purse, held it up for a beat, and flicked it right at Raquel's face.
The edge nicked Raquel's skin.
Before she could even scream in pain, Anastasia's voice came, cold as ice.
""This card's got 16 million dollars on it.
""Get on your knees, lick my shoes clean, and it's yours.
""That's generous enough for you?""
If they were going to throw money around, Anastasia wasn't about to lose.
""Anastasia, don't push it.
""Just because you've got Felty's money, you think you can act all high and mighty with me? Let's get one thing straight: he's marrying me. You're just the ex. Not even good enough to shine my shoes,"" Raquel shouted, her face twisting.
""Oh, Raquel. Use your brain if you've got one. You really think Felton gave me that kind of money, dumbass?""
Anastasia met her gaze, all cold and mocking.
""Did you just call me a dumbass, bitch?"" Raquel snapped.
""Yep.""
Raquel lost it and started throwing whatever she could grab.
Then she saw Felton standing nearby and started crying. Felton noticed right away, strode over, and pulled her into his arms. His eyes went straight to Anastasia, cold and sharp.
""Anastasia, I look away for one second, and you're already going after Raquel?""
He expected a protest, but Anastasia just wagged a finger at him.
""Nope. Even if you were right here, I'd still do the same.""
""Don't think I won't do something. Touch Raquel again, and you'll regret it.""
""Oh, yeah?"" Anastasia said, unfazed.
His threat only made her laugh.
Then she reached forward, yanked Raquel out of his arms, and slapped her across the face.
It happened too fast.
By the time they realized what had happened, Raquel's cheek was swollen and blood was on her lip.
""See that? I just slapped her. So, Felton, what now?"" Anastasia smirked, proud and fearless.
""Anastasia, stop pushing me. Even I've got limits.""
Felton pressed his lips together, his face tight.
The tension hung in the air until a voice cut through.
""Since when does Anastasia need a reason to put a vile woman in her place?
""Anastasia's my woman. She does whatever she wants.""
They turned to see Hobert walking over with a serious look. He pulled Anastasia behind him and met Felton's cold stare.
Warmth spread through her chest. She tugged at his sleeve and murmured, ""What are you doing here? I can handle this myself.""
""What, let those two gang up on you?
""You didn't even think to call me. Staying with me makes you look bad or what?"" he said.
Anastasia pouted, irritated at the scolding. ""Fine. When we get home, I'm telling Dad you bullied me. I'm his favorite.""
Hobert chuckled and ruffled her hair. His gaze softened. ""Alright, no more fussing. Want me to deal with this?""
""Nah. I got this,"" Anastasia replied.
Then she pointed at the security camera in the corner, mischief all over her face.
Chapter 7 Humiliation
Felton's face darkened as he stared at Anastasia.
She had never shown him this kind of affection in the past three years.
His sharp eyes stayed on her, something unreadable flickering in them.
Beside him, Raquel was sobbing, with her hand over her swollen cheek. People around started to feel sorry for her.
She had expected Felton to defend her, to lash out at Anastasia. But he said nothing. She looked up and saw his attention still on Anastasia.
Anger rose in Raquel's chest. She bit her lip, her voice shaking. ""Felty, it hurts... My mouth is bleeding.""
Only then did others notice the red mark on her cheek and blood on her lips.
Felton's face went hard. He pulled Raquel into his arms, then looked back at Anastasia.
""Anastasia, apologize to Raquel. If you do, we'll let this go.""
Raquel was upset as she wanted her to suffer more, but she couldn't say that out loud. ""I'll make the bitch pay for this big time,"" she thought bitterly.
Anastasia just scoffed, ""Apologize? Sure. Get on your knees and beg first.""
She looked completely unapologetic.
People around gasped, giving Anastasia pitying looks. She had picked the wrong fight‚ÄîFelton held real power in the city.
They thought she had picked the wrong fight as Felton had real power in the city.
Hobert frowned and stepped forward, casually putting himself between her and the others. ""My girl doesn't waste her time arguing with clowns. If something happened, it was because someone was dumb enough to start it.
""And this hotel has security cameras, so we'll find out soon enough,"" he said coldly.
Raquel tensed up.
If they checked the footage, Felton would find out the truth.
She couldn't let that happen.
But before she could protest, Arnoldo walked in with a laptop.
Raquel went pale right away. She grabbed Felton's sleeve, her voice small and shaky. ""Felty, I'm feeling dizzy. Let's just head home, okay?""
""What's wrong, Ms. Fletcher? Feeling guilty?"" Anastasia teased.
Felton ignored her and gently patted Raquel's back. ""Don't worry. I'll make sure you get justice.""
He started walking toward the laptop, but Anastasia beat him to it.
She grabbed it and hooked it up to the hotel's projector.
When the footage played, Raquel's sharp voice filled the room.
She froze, her face draining of color.
Her eyes widened in shock as she saw herself on the big screen‚Äîthrowing the card at Anastasia and getting humiliated in return.
Felton's face darkened, a warning of what was coming.
Raquel glanced at him, and panic surged through her. She tried to say something, but Felton gave her a long, unreadable look and then walked away.
She gathered up the skirt of her dress and rushed after him.
""Felty, wait! It's not what you think!""
But she tripped on the hem and fell face-first.
People around burst out laughing.
Raquel felt mortified. Seeing Felton outside the entrance, she scrambled up and limped after him.

Colette bit her lip, her eyes burning with rage. Clearly, she didn't want to admit defeat. Just as she was about to say something, Anastasia looked around and arched an eyebrow. ""Questions?""
The shareholders exchanged glances before lowering their heads and falling silent.
""You...""
As Colette was about to speak, Anastasia cut her off. ""Alright then. The meeting's over.""
Then Anastasia turned around and looked down at Colette. ""Ms. Lloyd, I want the detailed information about our current artists and their endorsements on my desk by this afternoon.""
Picking up her handbag, she smiled, ""Show me how efficient you are. We don't need good-for-nothings here.""
With that, she walked out in her twelve-centimeter-high heels briskly.
Colette clenched her fists, her face turning livid as she glared at Anastasia's retreating figure.
She thought, ""The new CEO is tough to deal with.""
Meanwhile, Anastasia walked into the elevator and pressed the button for the first floor deftly, as if she had been here a couple of times already.
As the elevator doors opened, her phone rang. She took it out and saw an unknown number flashing on the screen.
She answered and heard a mellow, polite male voice. ""Hi there. Is this Ms. Carney?""
""Yeah. Who's asking?"" she said flatly and unhurriedly.
""This is Mr. Gutierrez's lawyer. He's left you an asset, and you need to come down here to settle the transfer.""
Her gaze turned icy at once. ""Tell him I don't want his money.""
With that, she was about to hang up.
The lawyer, however, stopped her immediately. ""Wait, Ms. Carney!
""Mr. Gutierrez has left you a property. Even if you don't want it, you'll still have to come here and sign the papers.""
Anastasia thought, ""Does Felton really think I need that house?
""Too bad he's wrong.""
She said, ""Fine. Meet me at Messika Caf√© on Southwater Road.""
Her tone exuded an air of nobility, making anyone want to bow to her.
She strode out of the company, hailed a cab, and arrived at the caf√© ten minutes later.
The second she walked in, she saw Felton sitting by the window.
With a sneer, she walked toward him. ""Mr. Gutierrez, you really went all out just to see me.""
She pulled out a chair, sat down, laced her fingers together, rested them on the table lazily, and mocked, ""I didn't give you enough credit. Kudos on knowing my number.
""Tell me then. Why wouldn't you leave me alone?""
Felton still found it hard to accept‚Äîit was like she was a completely different person.
He wasn't here to fight with her, though.
He pushed the document on the table toward her. ""Take a look. It's what you'll have after the divorce.""
Anastasia glanced at him and said, not even touching the document, ""Felton, please tell me you don't really think I still care about this pocket change of yours.""
""Yeah, why would you? You've found yourself a sugar daddy, right?""
Felton suppressed his anger, his voice deep.
Anastasia smiled, feeling nothing. To her, Felton was already in the past.
He could believe whatever he wanted. She simply didn't give a damn.
""Whatever you say.""
""Is that a yes? So, you do have a sugar daddy?"" Felton's gaze darkened as his jawline tightened. It seemed he was trying his best to suppress his fury.
Chapter 12 Watch Your Mouth
Hearing Felton's sarcastic voice, Anastasia leaned backward and crossed her slender legs, looking lazy and elegant.
Arching an eyebrow, she looked at him and teased, ""It's so hard to get over me, huh?""
""You think too much."" Felton frowned, his expression changing subtly. Then he picked up the coffee and took a sip.
""Oh?"" She shifted her posture, staring at him while propping her slender fingers against her forehead. ""You baffle me, Mr. Gutierrez.
""What else could it be?""
Every movement she made was nothing but charming.
Looking at her, Felton suddenly felt some inexplicable feelings flashing across his heart and was uneasy suddenly.
He lowered his eyes, not wanting her to notice any change in his expression.
Then he said, ""Stop flattering yourself, Anastasia. After years, I'm sure you know pretty well that I don't have feelings for you at all.""
Anastasia was slightly stunned.
She no longer loved him, but her heart still ached whenever she thought about their past.
She regretted it so much‚Äîwhy did she waste so many years on such a jerk? He simply wasn't worth it.
Soon, she shot back with a sneer, ""You're right. I know that better than anyone, which is why I find you so pathetic, trying everything just to see me.""
She said this word by word, her eyes tinged with disgust and contempt.
Felton couldn't help but tighten his grip on the cup, his gaze laced with rage. Just as he was about to say something, her phone rang.
He swallowed back the words he wanted to say.
Meanwhile, Anastasia took out her phone and saw Hobert's name flashing on the screen. She smiled, the iciness on her face vanishing in a split second.
""Hello?""
""Your Highness, I'm here to pick you up for lunch.""
She couldn't help but chuckle.
A trace of shyness flashed across her delicate face as she said, ""Sure. I'm at Messika Caf√©.""
""I'll be there in five.""
""Alright.""
Felton heard Hobert's doting words loud and clear. He pulled a long face, and even the air around him was freezing.
""Anastasia, impressive. I had no idea you were such a slut.
""Do tell‚Äîwhat tricks did you pull to get in bed with Mr. Carney?""
His tone was icy, mixed with a trace of jealousy that he wasn't aware of.
Anastasia was furious.
She might be able to endure being insulted once or twice, but that was it.
""Watch your mouth, Felton. We're divorced. I can sleep with whoever I want, and you don't get to judge me at all.
""Aren't you the one who proposed a divorce? The second your unforgettable love came back, you dumped your wife. You're the impressive one!""
Felton's expression darkened to the utmost, and even a murderous intent flickered in his bloodshot eyes.
But she didn't care. When spotting the familiar car outside the door, she picked up her handbag and walked out without looking back.
Felton's face turned livid with fury as he saw Anastasia smile at the driver before getting into the passenger seat.
As Hobert drove away, his gaze inadvertently fell upon Felton, who was standing inside, and he frowned.
Chapter 13 She Blocks Him
Sitting in the passenger seat, Anastasia took out her compact to retouch her makeup.
Hobert curved his lip slightly as he noticed the smile on her face. ""What did he want?""
""Not important. He's already in the past now and isn't worth our time."" Anastasia waved her hand, refusing to let Felton spoil her mood.
Hearing this, Hobert turned the steering wheel and smiled, ""I'll treat you to something good.""
After ten minutes, he pulled up outside a restaurant.
Anastasia raised an eyebrow as she got out of the car. ""Steaks?""
Hobert wrapped his arm around her shoulders. ""Yeah. It's been so long since you last enjoyed steak, as I'm sure.""
She fell silent.
Over the years she had married Felton, she had been watching her figure and seldom relished steaks indeed.
Yet, as it turned out, all her sacrifice was nothing but a stupid mistake. Her gaze turned cold as she pulled out her phone, found Felton's number, blocked him without hesitation, and followed Hobert into the restaurant.
They sat at the reserved table, which was already full of dishes.
She was instantly in a great mood and started to dig in. Yum!
Yet, as she enjoyed the food, she suddenly saw someone pointing at her. Then whispers came into her ears.
""Is that the woman mentioned in the trending topic?""
""I think so. She looks like the woman in the photo...""
Puzzled, she glanced at them, and they lowered their heads at once.
Having a bad feeling, she took out her phone, only to see a photo of her meeting Felton earlier had become trendy.
Felton's face in the photo was clear, and hers was mostly blocked by a potted plant.
The headline of the trending topic went, ""Mr. Gutierrez's secret date!""
""Fuck me! Secret my ass!"" she couldn't help but curse.
""Paparazzi have no boundaries. I'll make some calls to make the trending topic go away."" Worried that Anastasia might get upset over some unpleasant memories, Hobert pulled out his phone at once.
""No need,"" she said after pondering for a few seconds.
""They only caught my side profile. I rarely show up in public, so I don't think anyone will recognize me. It won't affect me much. But...""
She smiled wickedly, already figuring out who was behind this. An idea struck her.
Meanwhile, Felton saw the trending topic, too.
He curved his lips into a meaningful smile and texted her, ""Anastasia, you really went all out for this stunt.""
Yet right after he clicked the ""Send"" button, a system notification popped up on his screen.
Immediately, he flew into a rage.
He slammed the table heavily.
How dare she block him!
She used to be so meek in front of him, doing whatever he asked her to do. But now, she was like an entirely different person.
Or ... it had been nothing but her act?
Just then, Arnoldo pushed the door open and entered. ""Mr. Gutierrez, about the collaboration with Regent Entertainment...""
He stopped talking at once and was at a loss for what to do because he saw the anger on Felton's face.
Felton looked up, his eyes burning with fury. ""Get the car ready. I'm heading to Regent Entertainment!""
Fifteen minutes later, a black Maybach pulled up outside Regent Entertainment's building.
Chapter 14 To Regent Entertainment
Arnoldo looked around but didn't spot any available parking. He braced himself to turn around and look at Felton in the back seat. ""Mr. Gutierrez, there's nowhere to park here. I'll drive to the parking lot.""
Felton pulled a long face and glanced at him coldly.
Arnoldo felt a chill running down his spine as he quickly turned the car around.
Just as they arrived at the parking lot, Felton tilted his head and saw Anastasia's slender figure.
He furrowed his brows even more tightly as he saw the Panamera keys in her hand.
""Pull over,"" he said before Arnoldo could find a spot.
Arnoldo was slightly stunned. Upon seeing Anastasia standing not far away, he immediately stepped on the brakes and opened the door.
Felton strode toward Anastasia.
""What are you doing here?""
Hearing the familiar voice, Anastasia turned around and was a bit slack-jawed to see Felton again.
A hint of helplessness flashed across her face. ""It's perfectly normal that I'm here. But not you, Mr. Gutierrez. Why are you here?""
""It's perfectly normal indeed, considering who your sugar daddy is.""
He tugged at the corner of his lips, his deep-set eyes unfathomable, his tone tinged with bitterness.
Anastasia's gaze deepened. However, in the next second, she spotted the proposal in his hand. She smiled, looking at him teasingly, ""No wonder you wouldn't leave me alone, Mr. Gutierrez. It turns out you want the collaboration.""
""What's that to you? You'd better explain that trending topic first.""
Felton stared at her coldly.
She casually brushed away a few scattered strands of hair, crossed her arms over her chest, leaned against the car lazily, and looked at him with amusement. ""Yeah, about that‚Äîthanks for reminding me.
""You know what? I'm starting to question your taste in women,"" she smiled. ""Tell Raquel I'm fed up with her lame tricks.""
Felton pulled a long face, his eyes darkening with rage. ""What do you mean?""
""Oh? You don't know?""
Anastasia chuckled, arching an eyebrow. ""I'm sure she does.""
Felton said, his voice stern, ""Are you saying she's behind the trending topic?""
""My, my. It seems you aren't a lost cause after all."" After saying this, she unlocked the car and was about to give it a test drive. However, just as she turned around, Felton grabbed her wrist and pressed her against the car.
His breathing became rapid as he stared at her intently. His perfectly chiseled face was only centimeters away from her, and they could hear each other's heartbeats.
Her heart raced instinctively, almost deafening.
""Anastasia, you keep badmouthing Raquel. Are you jealous? Or do you regret divorcing me?""
Meeting his icy gaze, which was devoid of any emotions, she suddenly snapped out of it.
She smiled and glanced at her wrist seized by him.
""Mr. Gutierrez, are you serious? Anyone who sees us right now will think you're the one who still can't get over me.""
Seeing her mocking smile, Felton let go at once as if scalded.
He turned around and adjusted his suit while facing her with his back. Frowning slightly, he thought, ""What has gotten into me? This isn't like me.""
Meanwhile, Anastasia had already calmed herself down. She let out a long breath before resting her eyes on the proposal he was holding again.
She chuckled, ""You may go back, Mr. Gutierrez. The CEO of Regent Entertainment won't see you.""
Hearing this, Felton turned around abruptly and glared at her. ""How would you know?
""Do you know him?""",1,1754773342.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

# Best Cup Holder for Walker 2025: Top-rated & Reviewed

The quest for maintaining independence and comfort while using a walker frequently enough involves simple yet impactful accessories. A cup holder for a walker might seem trivial, but it significantly enhances the user experience by providing a safe and convenient way to carry beverages, preventing spills and allowing for hands-free mobility. This small addition can substantially improve the daily lives of walker users, allowing them to enjoy a cup of coffee, water, or any othre drink while maintaining their balance and stability.

It's more than just a convenience; it's about restoring a sense of normalcy and freedom to individuals who rely on walkers for assistance. A well-designed cup holder can be a game-changer, enabling users to navigate their surroundings wiht greater confidence and reduce the risk of accidents associated with carrying liquids.

## Key Features analysis

An effective cup holder for a walker incorporates several essential features that contribute to its overall usability and functionality.

**Global Compatibility:**

The best cup holders are designed to fit a wide variety of walker frames.These models often feature adjustable clamps or straps that can accommodate different tubing diameters and frame shapes. This ensures that the cup holder can be securely attached to most standard walkers, rollators, and even some wheelchairs without requiring any specialized tools or modifications.

**Secure Mounting System:**

A reliable mounting system is crucial for preventing the cup holder from slipping or rotating during use. Look for cup holders that utilize robust clamps, screws, or hook-and-loop fasteners to ensure a stable and secure attachment to the walker frame. Some advanced models incorporate anti-slip materials or textured surfaces to further enhance the grip and prevent unwanted movement, even on uneven terrain.

**Spill-Proof Design:**

A spill-proof design minimizes the risk of messy accidents and helps to keep the user and their surroundings clean. This can be achieved through features like deep cup wells, secure lid mechanisms, and flexible inserts that grip the beverage container tightly.

Durability is an essential consideration for any walker accessory, as it needs to withstand daily use and exposure to various environmental conditions. Cup holders made from high-quality materials like ABS plastic, stainless steel, or aluminum offer superior resistance to impacts, scratches, and weathering. Reinforced construction and sturdy hardware ensure that the cup holder can withstand the demands of regular use without cracking, breaking, or losing its functionality over time.

A user-friendly design should prioritize easy installation and removal, allowing users to quickly attach or detach the cup holder as needed without requiring assistance.

1mm05lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1mm05lb/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the caf√©s. Even the caf√©s can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a caf√©, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a caf√© wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their caf√© and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local caf√© can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a reclaimed wood coffee table involves careful consideration of several factors. Durability, aesthetic appeal, size, and ethical sourcing are among the most crucial aspects. The top picks for 2025 excel in these areas, offering a blend of robustness, character, and responsible craftsmanship.

**Material and Construction:** The essence of a reclaimed wood coffee table lies in its material. Tables utilizing hardwoods like oak, maple, and pine sourced from old barns, factories, or even deconstructed homes are highly regarded. The method of construction is equally crucial. Dovetail joints, mortise and tenon joinery, and reinforced steel supports contribute to the structural integrity and longevity of the table. Tables with kiln-dried wood are preferred, as the drying process reduces the risk of warping or cracking over time.**Aesthetic Appeal and Finish:** The raw beauty of reclaimed wood is enhanced by the finish applied to it. Options range from natural oils and waxes that highlight the wood‚Äôs original texture and color variations, to more protective polyurethane coatings. Hand-rubbed finishes are notably prized for their depth and tactile quality. The design of the table, whether rustic, industrial, or modern, plays a significant role in its overall aesthetic appeal.

**Size and Dimensions:** The ideal size of a coffee table depends on the dimensions of your living room and the layout of your seating arrangement. Generally, a coffee table should be approximately two-thirds the length of your sofa and positioned 14-18 inches away from it. Height is another factor to consider, with most coffee tables ranging from 16-20 inches in height. Finding a table that fits proportionally within your space ensures both aesthetic harmony and functional convenience.

**Ethical Sourcing and Sustainability:** The growing awareness of environmental issues has made ethical sourcing a primary concern for many consumers.Reclaimed wood is inherently lasting, as it repurposes materials that would otherwise end up in landfills. However, it's also important to consider the practices of the furniture maker. companies that prioritize responsible sourcing, fair labor practices, and eco-kind finishes are highly valued. Supporting these businesses contributes to a more sustainable and ethical furniture industry.

**Storage and Functionality:** Some reclaimed wood coffee tables include built-in storage features such as drawers, shelves, or lift-top mechanisms. These features add functionality to the table, providing convenient space for storing magazines, remote controls, blankets, and other living room essentials.Consider whether you need additional storage space and choose a table that meets your specific needs.

**Customization options:** Several furniture makers offer customization options for reclaimed wood coffee tables. This allows you to tailor the table to your specific preferences, including size, finish, style, and storage options. Customization can be a great way to create a truly unique and personalized piece of furniture that perfectly complements your living space.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a wood reclaimed coffee table offers numerous benefits beyond its aesthetic appeal. Its unique character, durability, and sustainable nature make it a worthwhile addition to any home.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** no two reclaimed wood coffee tables are exactly alike. The natural variations in the wood, including knots, grain patterns, and nail holes, give each table a unique character and story. This adds visual interest and depth to your living room, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. A reclaimed wood coffee table can serve as a focal point, complementing both modern and customary decor styles.

**Increased Durability and longevity:** Reclaimed wood is often denser and stronger than newly harvested wood,due to its age and slow growth rate. This makes reclaimed wood coffee tables incredibly durable and resistant to wear and tear. With proper care, a reclaimed wood coffee table can last for generations, becoming a cherished family heirloom.

**Sustainable and Eco-Friendly:** Choosing a reclaimed wood coffee table is a sustainable choice that reduces your environmental impact. By repurposing wood that would otherwise be discarded,you are helping to conserve natural resources and reduce landfill waste. this aligns with the growing trend of eco-conscious consumerism.

**Added Value and Investment:** reclaimed wood furniture often appreciates in value over time, particularly if it is made from rare or historically significant wood.Investing in a high-quality reclaimed wood coffee table can be a financially sound decision, as it is likely to retain or increase its value over the years.This is especially true for tables made by renowned furniture makers or those featuring unique design elements.

**Conversation Piece and Storytelling:** Each reclaimed wood coffee table has a unique history and story to tell. The wood may have originated from an old barn, a historic building, or a decommissioned ship. These stories add character and depth to the table, making it a conversation piece that sparks curiosity and interest. You can learn about the origin of the wood and share its story with your guests,creating a connection to the past.

1mm02zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mm02zx/how_does_le_creuset_french_press_compare_to_other/,How Does Le Creuset French Press Compare to Other Coffee Makers?,"The Le Creuset 70706200170171 French Press in Caribbean is an absolute delight for coffee enthusiasts seeking a blend of style, durability, and performance. It sits proudly on my kitchen counter like a vibrant piece of art, and let me just say, it doesn‚Äôt merely serve coffee‚Äìit‚Äôs part of the entire experience. After spending several weeks of morning rituals with this French press, I feel equipped to share what it gets right and where it might make you raise an eyebrow. Pull up a cup of java as I take you through the ups and downs of this product.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
This French press immediately catches the eye with its chic Caribbean blue color and timeless stoneware design. I‚Äôm all about kitchenware that doubles as d√©cor, and this piece didn‚Äôt disappoint. The build feels premium, from the weight of the product to its noticeable attention to detail, including the ergonomic handle that offers a comfortable grip. It‚Äôs crafted from durable stoneware that promises exceptional heat retention, and I found that it genuinely keeps my coffee warmer for longer compared to other presses I‚Äôve tried. Cleaning is a breeze too, thanks to its smooth non-porous glazed surface, which resists stains and chips. 

**Filter Performance and Coffee Quality**  
The reusable filter is where this device shines for someone who hates the wastefulness of disposable filters. It truly extracts bold and full-bodied flavors without letting coffee grounds sneak into your cup. Each press I‚Äôve made has been smooth and rich in taste. I also used it to steep loose tea leaves, and it works just as well. Whether it‚Äôs rustic coffee grounds or delicate tea leaves, the result is consistently fantastic. Keep in mind that you‚Äôll need to get the hang of using coarsely ground coffee beans, but once you do, the quality feels caf√©-level impressive.

**Ease of Use and Operation**  
Being a manual coffee maker, this French press strips away any unnecessary complexities. Add coffee grounds or tea leaves, pour in boiling water, stir, and press‚Äîit‚Äôs as simple as that. I‚Äôm someone who rushes through mornings, but this little ritual has become oddly calming. Pouring coffee feels controlled and mess-free, thanks to the well-designed spout.

**Check Le Creuset 70706200170171 price on Amazon.**

**Advantages**  
‚Ä¢ Exceptional heat retention keeping your brew warm longer  
‚Ä¢ Nonstick glazed surface makes cleaning effortless  
‚Ä¢ Aesthetic design that adds elegance to any kitchen  
‚Ä¢ Versatile for brewing tea or coffee  
‚Ä¢ Dishwasher safe for added convenience  

**Areas of Concern**  
‚Ä¢ The three-pound weight might feel heavy for some users.  
‚Ä¢ Stoneware material is not as shatter-resistant as stainless steel.  
‚Ä¢ Price places it in a higher category compared to simpler French presses.  

**Material Durability and Maintenance**  
The stoneware construction makes this French press resistant to chips, scratches, and stains. However, it's not entirely invincible. I found myself treating it with care, handling it delicately to avoid any accidents on my granite countertop. While the glaze ensures exceptional durability, it‚Äôs worth noting that stoneware can shatter if dropped.

**Competing Products**  
French presses come in a variety of materials, such as stainless steel and glass, so comparing it to others was inevitable. For instance, the Bodum Chambord is an all-time classic in the world of French presses thanks to its attractive price point and stainless steel build. However, the Le Creuset stands out for its heat retention and style. Another competitor, the Fellow Clara French Press, features sleek modern functionality with an insulated stainless steel body, but it lacks the vibrant personality and bold aesthetic appeal of this model.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Is it pricey compared to other French presses? Yes. Do the features justify the investment? That really depends on what you're looking for. The premium design, heat retention capabilities, and reusable filter do add extra value compared to lower-priced models. Sure, if you‚Äôre prioritizing budget over elegance, there are simpler options available. But for someone who loves a thoughtful coffee-making experience accompanied by jaw-dropping aesthetics, this is an investment in style and function.

1mm01me,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1mm01me/i_overcame_it_and_you_can_too/,I overcame it and you can too.,"When I had DP/DR, it felt like it would never go away, but I never lost hope that this day would come. And I want to note that many people leave this community after overcoming DP/DR without sharing their experiences. When I was struggling with this condition, I promised myself that if I recovered, I would do everything I could to help others. I‚Äôve been planning to write this guide for a long time, but I never found the right moment and even drafted and deleted it several times. Now, here it is!



#What is DP/DR?
DP/DR is a defense mechanism that our brain deploy to protect us from excessive stress. During moments of intense stress, such as panic attacks, trauma, anxiety, or severe depression, the brain may disconnect us from ourselves and our environment to cope. This mechanism prevents us from ‚Äúfully‚Äù experiencing the overwhelming stress. It‚Äôs a quite interesting process, and that‚Äôs how it works. According to an article, most people experience DP/DR at some point in their lives, but typically only briefly. Normally, when the extreme stress subsides, DP/DR resolves as well. However, in some individuals and situations, it persists and becomes chronic.


#What happens in the brain during DP/DR?
The exact mechanisms of depersonalization/derealization are not fully understood, but it is hypothesized that some brain regions are underactive while others are overactive, leading to miscommunication between these regions. Other potential factors include glutamate dysregulation, kappa-opioid receptor agonism, and insufficient oxygen supply to certain brain areas. In the following chapters, I will revisit these issues and discuss available treatment options.


#Who are more likely to develop chronic DP/DR?
As I mentioned, DP/DR is a very under-diagnosed condition that many people experience at some point in their lives. For most, it resolves spontaneously without intervention. However, in some cases, it persists. Based on my observations, those with chronic DP/DR often have an underlying mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, OCD, panic disorder, or bipolar disorder and so on. In short, individuals with these conditions are more likely to experience chronic DP/DR.


#How did I develop DP/DR?
My experience is not much different from others‚Äô stories. One day, I smoked weed with a friend and, for the first time in my life, I had an extremely severe panic attack. My heart pounded incredibly fast and powerful for two hours, and during that time, I was convinced I was going to die. I couldn‚Äôt go to the hospital because weed was illegal. If I had to describe those moments in one word, I would say, ‚Äúterror‚Äù. And eventually, the panic attack subsided, and I went home.
When I woke up, a different world awaited me. My hands felt foreign, my face seemed unfamiliar, and the world appeared unreal. Everything felt incredibly artificial. At first, I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening. I was terrified that I damaged my brain and could only cry. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, but when I shared this with my roommate, she was incredibly supportive. She, my friend, and I went on a vacation to escape it all, and by the end of five days, the DP/DR was completely gone. I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. Was that really all it took? (As I mentioned, it resolves quickly for most people.) But one night, while sleeping, I had a vivid flashback of that night and when I woke up, the DP/DR was back. Later, it faded on its own again. But one day, a text notification from my friend with whom I smoked marijuana triggered my entire trauma all over again. The content of the message was quite ordinary, but my brain likely associated my friend with my trauma. Seeing the notification, or rather, my friend's notification, literally triggered my trauma again, and this time, the DP/DR became permanent.


#Recovery
This is the chapter everyone wants to read, and I can assure you that DP/DR is an absolutely recoverable disorder. I say this with 100% confidence. For some, recovery is easy for others, it requires a lot of dedication and hard work. There are dozens of ways to recover, and I‚Äôll share what I‚Äôve learned so far from people that cured DP/DR, articles, clinical trials and etc. 

###1. Address Underlying Causes 
As I mentioned earlier, one of the first and most critical steps to overcoming DP/DR is tackling its underlying causes. If you struggle with anxiety, depression, panic disorder, or other mental health conditions, treating these should be your top priority. For many, resolving the underlying issue causes DP/DR to disappear on its own.

###2. Stop Obsessing Over DP/DR 
Constantly reading about DP/DR is like pouring gasoline on a fire. If you view DP/DR as a fire, your goal is to extinguish it, not fuel it. My advice is to read only recovery stories for a couple of days to see for yourself that recovery is possible and to learn about the many ways others have healed. However, after a short period, stop reading about DP/DR entirely.

###3. Socialize 
Go out, have coffee with a friend, take a vacation, or join a reading, cycling, or dance club. Immerse yourself in nature, learn a new language, or pick up an instrument. Try dating or adopting a cat or dog. I can‚Äôt stress enough the importance of socializing. As I mentioned earlier, a five-day vacation helped clear my head and temporarily eliminated my DP/DR. By the way, I highly recommend adopting a cat a natural serotonin booster!

###4. Drop Harmful Habits
Eliminate sugar, refined carbohydrates, processed foods, alcohol, and smoking in short, anything harmful to your body. Reducing these lowers stress and cortisol levels, which naturally benefits DP/DR.

###5. Adopt a Ketogenic Diet
Implementing a ketogenic diet is challenging, but the rewards are significant. I‚Äôve seen many people fully recover from DP/DR simply by following a ketogenic diet. During my time on keto, my motivation, mood, and energy levels increased, and I felt healthier overall, even noticing improvements for my digestion. Though I‚Äôm not an expert, research shows the ketogenic diet supports cognitive function, neuroprotection, reduced inflammation, and improved mental health. 

###6. Intermittent Fasting
I‚Äôve read on this subreddit and other forums that intermittent fasting benefits many people. Someone shared a scientific article highlighting IF‚Äôs positive effects on brain function and neuroinflammation. I encourage you to research and explore these benefits for yourself.

###7. Exercise and Cardio
Exercise, including bodybuilding and cardio, is incredibly beneficial for mental health. It‚Äôs well-known that building muscle naturally boosts endorphins, enhancing mood. Physical activity is vital not only for the body but also for the brain, as it increases self-confidence. The better our bodies look and the more conditioned we are, the more confident we feel. My advice is to keep workouts moderate, lasting no longer than 45 minutes, to avoid excessive cortisol spikes, which can worsen stress. I recommend a full-body workout 3‚Äì4 times a week and 10‚Äì15 minutes of daily cardio.

###8. Meditation
I don‚Äôt know a better way to relax and release stress trapped in our bodies. Before I started meditating, I thought it was nonsense. How could sitting quietly and clearing your mind help? But meditation calms the mind, quiets the constant inner chatter, and reduces stress. No need to overcomplicate it. I meditated for 5‚Äì10 minutes every morning upon waking and before bed each night.

###9. Full-Body Muscle Relaxation
There are several videos on YouTube explaining how to perform this technique. In essence, you tighten and then relax each muscle group in your body, from your hands to your feet. This practice not only promotes relaxation but also helps release tension and stress stored in your muscles.
https://youtu.be/ihO02wUzgkc?si=vyeYFnTSy3PgQ4R9

###10. Trauma Release Exercises
I highly recommend these exercises if your DP/DR developed after a traumatic event. In brief, these exercises involve shaking to release trauma trapped in the body.
https://youtu.be/FeUioDuJjFI?si=0IoLH8C3ruoa1ACR

###11. Affirmations
I can‚Äôt stress enough the importance of convincing your brain that you are healthy and everything is okay. I learned a powerful tactic from a woman named Wizard Liz in her video ‚ÄúThis Video Will Change Your Life,‚Äù and I applied everything I learned there.
https://youtu.be/Lk6AkrT5g5w?si=47vbMPjBp86pAHTj

###12. Vagus Nerve Stimulation Exercises 
The vagus nerve regulates the parasympathetic nervous system in our body. Chronic stress, trauma, and similar events might dysregulate it, causing the body to remain stuck in fight-or-flight mode under the control of the sympathetic nervous system. There are numerous vagus nerve exercises available on YouTube, and I highly recommend trying them. I also purchased a Vagus Nerve Stimulation Device, which you wear in your ear or around your neck. It sends low-power electrical signals to activate the vagus nerve. Check it out.
https://pulsetto.tech/products/meet-pulsetto

###13. Breathing Exercises
We breathe in and out tens of thousands of times each day, making it essential to optimize this constant process. There are many breathing exercises, most of which share similar principles. My favorite is the 4-7-8 breathing technique. Research I‚Äôve come across suggests that breathing exercises can reduce stress and alleviate dissociation, making them highly effective for overall well-being.
https://youtu.be/Gr2XFEDPGf0?si=oHGm_Y5zxR-oBSYE

###14. Eye Exercises
In my experience, these are particularly helpful for derealization. When DP/DR, my eye muscles felt drained and constantly fatigued, making it torturous to focus on a single point. To perform this exercise, place two objects at eye level one far away and one nearby. Close one eye and focus on the far object, then switch to the near object, alternating to train your eye muscles. Repeat 20‚Äì30 times or more for each eye. You can find guided eye exercises by searching on YouTube.
https://youtu.be/ZWUNJohX-m0?si=woCwP0HQKUsoyv-G

###15. Trauma Release Yoga
This was my favorite activity during my healing process because it felt incredibly rejuvenating for my body. I loved relaxing my muscles, pushing my body to its limits, and holding specific poses. Yoga is, in my opinion, one of the best activities for nurturing both body and mind.
https://youtu.be/24qDdn2QXjk?si=vcORXf4B_9_ubYbc

###16. Cold Shower Upon Waking
When I was experiencing DP/DR, I constantly felt tired and sleepy. Cold showers delivered such a shock to my system that I felt wide awake and energized immediately afterward, with the effects lasting all day. 

###17. Comprehensive Blood Test
Getting a comprehensive blood test is crucial, as deficiencies in certain vitamins or minerals can worsen DP/DR. I recommend testing for B vitamins, vitamin D, iron, magnesium, DHEA, DHEA-S, cortisol, testosterone, and thyroid function.

###18. Supplements
During my healing process, I tried numerous supplements, many of which I found unnecessary. However, some were quite helpful, including magnesium glycinate, omega-3, phosphatidylserine, probiotics, taurine, glycine, and ginkgo biloba. Also I suggest taking Vitamin D and Iron injections regardless of your levels. High level of Iron will supply more oxygen to brain which in theory should help to DP/DR. 

###19. Regular Sleep
I should have mentioned this earlier, but I overlooked it. Getting 7‚Äì8 hours of uninterrupted sleep daily is crucial. On days when I slept enough, I felt more alert and energetic, and my DP/DR symptoms were less severe. Conversely, on days when I didn‚Äôt get enough sleep, my DP/DR especially derealization worsened significantly. Using BreatheRight strips at night greatly improved my sleep quality, and I highly recommend them.

###20. Medications
Medications can be hit-or-miss. A drug that works quickly for one person may have no effect on another. My advice is to choose medications based on the underlying cause of your DP/DR. For example, if someone experiences frequent anxiety attacks, an antidepressant to manage anxiety may also alleviate DP/DR symptoms. In my opinion, the most promising medications include clomipramine, lamotrigine, naltrexone, clonazepam (for intense anxiety and panic attacks), Adderall, and pregabalin. Always research these medications thoroughly and consult your doctor before starting any treatment.

###21. Neurobic Exercises
One of the primary causes of dissociation is believed to be an imbalance in brain activity, where some areas are overactive while others are underactive. This imbalance disrupts communication between different parts of the brain. As a result, our perceptions, environment, and bodily sensations feel altered or unfamiliar. To address this, we need to engage in exercises that stimulate various brain regions. These exercises help the brain create new neural pathways and repair those that are malfunctioning. Examples include brushing your teeth with your non-dominant hand.

#Treatments I Haven‚Äôt Tried but Believe May Help

##1. Norbinaltorphimine
As mentioned earlier, I hypothesize that kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) upregulation contributes to DP/DR symptoms. The KOR mechanism is highly complex, directly or indirectly affecting serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate levels. Research suggests that KOR agonism can induce out-of-body experiences and DP/DR-like symptoms. If KOR agonism triggers or exacerbates DP/DR, its antagonism could, in theory, alleviate these symptoms. Many individuals on forums and subreddits report overcoming DP/DR using naltrexone, an opioid antagonist. However, naltrexone inhibits not only KOR but also Mu and Delta opioid receptors, preventing endorphins from binding to these receptors, which are crucial for experiencing pleasure and well-being. Additionally, naltrexone has low affinity for KOR, meaning it does not fully inhibit it. Through my research, I found norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI) as a promising alternative. Nor-BNI has an exceptionally high affinity for KOR, enabling near-complete or complete inhibition, while its affinity for mu- and delta-opioid receptors is minimal, preserving endorphin function, an advantage for DP/DR treatment.
I must emphasize that norbinaltorphimine is an experimental substance. It is not FDA-approved, and to my knowledge, no clinical trials in humans have been conducted. Anecdotal reports suggest benefits for some individuals, but it remains unapproved for clinical use. If you are considering nor-BNI, I strongly recommend conducting thorough research and consulting with medical professionals experienced in this area.


##2. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy
As I mentioned earlier, I hypothesize that insufficient oxygen supply to the brain may contribute to DP/DR symptoms. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can increase oxygen delivery to the brain by approximately 20 times compared to normal conditions. If brain dysfunction in DP/DR is linked to lack of oxygen, HBOT could address this by providing significantly more oxygen. Anecdotal evidence suggests that HBOT has helped some individuals reduce DP/DR symptoms and brain fog. Dr. Daniel Amen, founder of Amen Clinics, has noted HBOT‚Äôs potential promise for DP/DR patients, further supporting its exploration as a treatment option.


##3. TMS and Neurofeedback
As I previously discussed, DP/DR is often associated with imbalanced brain activity, where some regions are overactive or underactive, leading to disrupted communication between brain areas. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and neurofeedback both address these dysregulations but differ in approach. TMS uses magnetic pulses to directly stimulate specific brain regions, while neurofeedback trains individuals to self-regulate brainwave patterns through real-time feedback. Both therapies leverage external interventions to restore balanced brain function. I liken these two, especially Neurofeedback, to Neurobic exercises. The only problem is that they are both very costly treatment options.






I‚Äôve shared everything that has helped me to the best of my ability. I understand that applying all these things may feel overwhelming, but my advice is to do as much as you can, as often as you can. With persistence, you can reclaim your freedom and return to your former self. I hope this guide offers hope and practical support to those having DP/DR.",2,1754772956.0,dpdr,1,1.0,False

However, it's vital to check the specifications of the timer and the LED lights to ensure that the timer is rated to handle the wattage of the lights. In some cases, an electronic timer is needed for compatibility with certain LEDs.

**Can I use an outlet timer to control a high-wattage appliance like a space heater?**

It depends on the specific outlet timer. Always check the maximum wattage rating of the timer and ensure that it exceeds the wattage of the space heater. Exceeding the wattage rating can overload the timer and potentially cause a fire hazard. If you need to control a high-wattage appliance, look for a heavy-duty outlet timer specifically designed for that purpose.

**How accurate are the timers, and do they drift over time?**

Modern digital outlet timers are generally very accurate, with minimal drift over time. Most timers use a quartz crystal oscillator to maintain accurate timekeeping. Though, some timers may experience slight drift due to temperature fluctuations or other factors.To minimize drift, it's important to choose a high-quality timer from a reputable brand.

**Can outlet timers be used outdoors?**

Yes, but only if they are specifically designed for outdoor use. Outdoor outlet timers are typically weatherproof or waterproof to protect them from the elements. They also frequently enough come with a sealed enclosure and a heavy-duty power cord. Using an indoor outlet timer outdoors can be perilous and may result in electrical shock or equipment damage.

We were never best friends, and it was always a casual friendship up until we were 15 when we randomly just started hanging out to go on walks and read together in the woods. 

Then when I was 16 I met this other girl ""Lizzy"". At that point I was trying to become more extroverted so when I saw her I complimented her curly red hair and we ended up chatting for a bit and exchanged contact details. We ended up meeting up for coffee and she told me all about how all her past friend groups had been so horrible to her and she didn't really have any friends anymore. Of course, as a self proclaimed empath I invited her to hang out with my friend group at school. We ended up becoming quite close, and when I was just as close with Lizzy as I was with Sarah (but slightly closer with Sarah) Lizzy (who didn't know I was friends with Sarah) dropped a story that Sarah was in (but wasn't centred around her) and said something like ""Katie is nice, but I don't like Sarah.""
I was like ""Sarah [last name]?"" and Lizzy replied ""Yeah that's the one... oh are you friends with her? Sorry I didn't realise. You can still be friends with her, I don't mind.""

I didn't ask what had happened between the 2 of them because I honestly just didn't want to know and have to choose between 2 people. Also... all of Lizzies stories about other people just seemed very intense and a bit imaginative. Everyone Lizzy talked about seemed crazy from the way she painted them. She once forgot her ex-bestfriends birthday and painted herself as the victim because her best friend was annoyed with her. 

Then that summer we went on a camping trip and Lizzy finally revealed why she wasn't friends with Sarah (who I now knew she used to be in a friendgroup with before). According to Lizzy, her ex-friendship group with 10+ people all turned against her for no reason. Then Sarah made a groupchat and sent a text to it asking everyone to tell Lizzy what their problems with her were. She said this was traumatising to her, which I understand.

The only time Sarah has ever mentioned Lizzy to me was when she said ""me and Lizzy had our beef a few years ago, but I'm chill with her now.""

Guys, I just have no idea who I would pick to be friends with in this scenario. In most circumstances I would NEVER be friends with someone who did my friend wrong but in this case I was already good friends with them both before I knew about all this.

Sarah doesn't gossip much so I don't have much of a story from her, I know she is a confrontational person but not argumentative. Lizzy is a very sweet person and acts like you're the best person she's ever met but forgets you exist the moment you leave the room, doesn't reply to your texts for months and blames ""not being on her phone"" on her trauma from those mean texts (despite the fact that she's the first to view my story and is online on IG 24/7).

It doesn't matter so much now as I've drifted away from both of them a fair bit after going to Uni. Lizzy is dating my brother (with my permission) yet hasn't replied to me since early May, and Sarah I just don't see so much either. 

But in this scenario, am I an asshole for staying friends with them both? And which one should I have stayed friends with? I felt so guilty and on edge the entire time I was close with them both.",1,1754772566.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

We were never best friends, and it was always a casual friendship up until we were 15 when we randomly just started hanging out to go on walks and read together in the woods. 

Then when I was 16 I met this other girl ""Lizzy"". At that point I was trying to become more extroverted so when I saw her I complimented her curly red hair and we ended up chatting for a bit and exchanged contact details. We ended up meeting up for coffee and she told me all about how all her past friend groups had been so horrible to her and she didn't really have any friends anymore. Of course, as a self proclaimed empath I invited her to hang out with my friend group at school. We ended up becoming quite close, and when I was just as close with Lizzy as I was with Sarah (but slightly closer with Sarah) Lizzy (who didn't know I was friends with Sarah) dropped a story that Sarah was in (but wasn't centred around her) and said something like ""Katie is nice, but I don't like Sarah.""
I was like ""Sarah [last name]?"" and Lizzy replied ""Yeah that's the one... oh are you friends with her? Sorry I didn't realise. You can still be friends with her, I don't mind.""

I didn't ask what had happened between the 2 of them because I honestly just didn't want to know and have to choose between 2 people. Also... all of Lizzies stories about other people just seemed very intense and a bit imaginative. Everyone Lizzy talked about seemed crazy from the way she painted them. She once forgot her ex-bestfriends birthday and painted herself as the victim because her best friend was annoyed with her. 

Then that summer we went on a camping trip and Lizzy finally revealed why she wasn't friends with Sarah (who I now knew she used to be in a friendgroup with before). According to Lizzy, her ex-friendship group with 10+ people all turned against her for no reason. Then Sarah made a groupchat and sent a text to it asking everyone to tell Lizzy what their problems with her were. She said this was traumatising to her, which I understand.

The only time Sarah has ever mentioned Lizzy to me was when she said ""me and Lizzy had our beef a few years ago, but I'm chill with her now.""

Guys, I just have no idea who I would pick to be friends with in this scenario. In most circumstances I would NEVER be friends with someone who did my friend wrong but in this case I was already good friends with them both before I knew about all this.

Sarah doesn't gossip much so I don't have much of a story from her, I know she is a confrontational person but not argumentative. Lizzy is a very sweet person and acts like you're the best person she's ever met but forgets you exist the moment you leave the room, doesn't reply to your texts for months and blames ""not being on her phone"" on her trauma from those mean texts (despite the fact that she's the first to view my story and is online on IG 24/7).

It doesn't matter so much now as I've drifted away from both of them a fair bit after going to Uni. Lizzy is dating my brother (with my permission) yet hasn't replied to me since early May, and Sarah I just don't see so much either. 

But in this scenario, am I an asshole for staying friends with them both? And which one should I have stayed friends with? I felt so guilty and on edge the entire time I was close with them both.",1,1754772426.0,friendship,0,1.0,False
1mlztuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FaroeIslands/comments/1mlztuy/some_questions_about_living_in_the_faroe_islands/,Some questions about living in the Faroe Islands.,"Hello,

I am Faroese but grew up elsewhere and decided I wanted to be close to this side of my family for a bit and just landed here August  5th. So far I have signed into the community, found a job and got a phone plan. I do have some questions of things I‚Äôm not sure or haven‚Äôt found a good resource on. 

1. Medical Services. I asked the person at the community center when signing into the community how to sign up for it and she advised it would be automatic. Does anyone one know how and when I would get notified of my appointments and also is there anything unique to here that I should be aware of. I am on one low dosage of a prescription and have a few months supply left but wanted to see if possible to get my prescription updated here and how that works. Also is medication something that you have to pay for and if someone can point me to resources that would be great. I can read for the most part in Faroese so it doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be in English. 

2. Fitness. I live in Leirv√≠k and am hoping to find a fitness center nearby. I‚Äôve seen a few online but am unsure on pricing and what people recommend. I would  go to the gym for weight lifting. Do most places have free weights or are they machines? I know Leirvik used to have a pool open for swimming but from the looks of it I would guess it‚Äôs closed.  Are there any open pools that are reasonably priced or might offer a monthly fee to use? 

Hiking. I hike a decent amount and just hiked Mount Fuji 3 weeks ago. I haven‚Äôt hiked here yet this time but would love to know what the norms are. Is hiking alone considered safe and accepted? I understand the weather changes frequently and precautions would need to be taken but wasn‚Äôt sure the etiquette and expectation. If hiking alone is not a generally recommended activity are there any Facebook groups or forums where people organize casual hikes?

Cycling: are there any good bicycle shops in Klaksv√≠k that anyone uses. I have a Brompton and plan to do most of the work on it myself but if I need to purchase a helmet or accessories I was curious if there is a place that is your go to for such things. Or if it a more intense project or repair I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable tackling. Also are there any odd rules about cycling beyond the common sense rules of use slower road, avoid tunnels when possible, and be careful of the weather. 

Rowing? I have seen a couple rowing events over the years and while I‚Äôm definitely not in shape to do it competitively is there opportunity to try it or see what it‚Äôs like. 

3. Food/supplements. Do stores carry Vitamin D/Magnesium/Protein? I‚Äôve lived most my life in sunny places and feel like with the darker winters it may be a good idea to take supplements.

What is the cheapest protein here besides going to the harbor and catching fish? I try to consume close to 200 grams a day and currently eating half of it from eggs may not be sustainable. 10 eggs a day is quite expensive. Most of my shopping is done between Leirvik and Runavik. Are there any items that are better to buy in larger towns in bulk  to save money from meat to vegetables vs Effo or A? 

Does anyone have a favorite place they go to get specialty items? Specifically good unground coffee beans, Olive oil, and pizza flour? I‚Äôve checked a few places and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be available but was curious if I visited some of the bigger towns if there were places I could find them.

Thanks for any advice on this long list of random things as I‚Äôm trying to adjust to life here. Also lastly if there‚Äôs any good resources on Faroese History, Culture, and events to get involved in I‚Äôd also love to hear about how I can better be a part of society here.

>>Is this commonplace among Asian Americans?
>>>Different culture. Education being a big deal has automatic and obvious differences than a culture that doesn‚Äôt focus on education
>>>>Right... so the one culture we're talking about has absolutely regressed by comparison.
>>>>>Yeah but do people out there really believe that one culture rises or falls just because of how the people in that culture behave in a vacuum?  That‚Äôs absurd, people act differently when outside forces have affects on them, outside forces like I dunno, being chased through the woods and hanged by the neck by a buncha white people calling you an animal.

I am back on my feet and almost 100% by adhering to a mostly meat and water diet and detoxing from all the oxalates that caused so many mysterious issues and I also had a B12 methylation issue along with folate absorption and B1 was not being absorbed and recently zinc and copper issues but I have successfully worked my way through and repaired my methylation issues with Choline and methyl vitamins.

Looking back now it all makes sense with the MCAS like symptoms and the anxiety disorders along with POTS like symptoms and Insomnia and the debilitating fatigue and they all just disappeared when I figured out my absorption issues and corrected them.

The decade of dysbiosis and skin issues and sluggish liver and candida overgrowth was debilitating and contributed to insomnia and mood disorders. Eventually I ended up reacting to everything and feeling horrible and could barely breath and function half of the time and was running slow the other half. I was plagued with sensitivities like Histamines, Tyramines, Salicylates, Oxalates, Lectins, Goiterogens and more and eventually ended up on bedrest after converting more over to a plant based diet. All this time having silent Celiac with little to no gut issues or symptoms. The nerve issues and symptoms were so severe and mysterious that I was sure I had a mold issue in and under the house.

I decided to try extreme measures and after no luck with a decade of probiotics and eating mostly healthy I went very low carb and stuck to a meat, leafy greens and olive oil and went through quite a bit of die off flu like symptoms for a month or more and was able to eliminate the overgrowth and white coated tongue that seems to be a good gauge or progress. Turns out allergy test showed no to very little reaction to various molds and I have never had any issues to mold that I can remember. All of my lymph nodes are mostly normal now and no more pain and inflammation that endured for about 10 years.

B12 and B1 was most likely the mysterious nervous system issues along with all the Oxalates I accumulated through trying to eat healthy the entire time.

I have recently been reminded the high oxalate foods like certain leafy greens, sweet potatoes, dark chocolate, tea and nuts along with spices like turmeric eaten daily can bring back some of the mysterious issues and have backslid a month over this and am finally feeling better again and back to about 85% where I was actually feeling amazing just before this.

I decided to go mostly grass fed meat and water after losing my progress to oxalates in the greens and realizing that I thrive on just the nutrients and nothing more for my body to sort out, at least for now.

Low Choline was a big one as I have a small egg allergy and with a Choline deficiency the body's ability to methylate B12 and Folate will always be impaired and for this I use sunflower lecithin daily and I try not to over do it as it makes me tired and lazy but goes away after a day or two.

Zinc and copper were the last pieces of the puzzle as although I was feeling amazing I was still having sleep issues and getting little anemic days but have that figured out.

A hair analysis is going to be the ticket as blood serum levels will only show after bones and tissue has been depleted and this has helped me immensely.

If one dabbles back into high oxalate eating and starts feeling bad again then it could throw off Magnesium and Calcium and this can take weeks to get back balanced.

It has been a long rocky road for me but in the end the ticket to vitality for my health is just the nutrients needed for life and nothing more for the body to sort out and I find this with a nutrient dense grass fed meat and water diet and supplementing with methyl Folate and  methyl B12 and supporting B complex in custom amounts along with seasonal low Oxalate veggies only if desired. B6 eventually caused me some issues so I changed to the converted P5p and cut back quite a bit.

Oh yeah, digestive enzymes seem to be helping with the loose stools and nutrient absorption from the fatty meat and adjusting and helping since my gallbladder was damaged due to immune issues from celiac and oxalates.

I probably would not have recovered if I did not do the high dose B1 (Thiamin) protocol for a couple months to reactivate enzyme pathways. 1500mg per day and felt really good after a couple weeks and after that it has been a game of chasing co factors to stay in the feeling great phase. All nutrients work together and rely on certain co factors to work correctly.

If you can figure out which nutrient and  co factor is short you can get your vitality back. I use melatonin for mitochondrial repair along with COQ10.

Gotta keep those toxins to minimum as my immune system is a little different and to stay in this sweet spot and keep nutrient absorption to the max I have to avoid coffee and do a small cup of green tea and caffeine pills as they do not seem to affect nutrients life coffee.

I think I am starting to feel better than I ever have and only have a slow day every now and then.

As in, those ‚Äúwhich squares have streetlights‚Äù time-wasters that make us all question if we‚Äôre human or not? I‚Äôm officially **confused** AND a teeny bit **shocked**.

Like, is this the new side hustle or some internet fever dream? Because honestly, if someone told me last year that 2024‚Äôs hottest app gig would be solving robots‚Äô least favorite quiz, I would‚Äôve laughed SO hard. But now‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt look away from stories about these ‚ÄúApp Testing Gateways.‚Äù Are they LEGIT or the digital equivalent of selling snake oil?  
Let‚Äôs break it down, because my curious/my skeptical brain *needs* answers:

- You sign up on ‚ÄúGet paid to Test Apps!‚Äù sites. (Sounds cool, right?)
- Instead of actual reviews or gameplay, you hit a wall of CAPTCHAS. Over and over.
- Some folks swear they‚Äôre getting paid, others say their points just‚Äîvanish.
- Payouts range from pennies to‚Ä¶well, not enough to quit your day job, let‚Äôs just say.  
By the way: I got pulled into this rabbit hole by stumbling onto **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**.  
So naturally, because I can‚Äôt help myself, I signed up on **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**. First thing that pops up? You guessed it‚Äîthe ‚Äúprove you‚Äôre not a bot!‚Äù task marathon.

Where are the survey questions? An app to review? Nope. Just CAPTCHAS.  
Is this, like, sneaky app training data farming for AI companies? Or do they genuinely hand out cash for us to help ‚Äúteach the robots‚Äù what a bus looks like? **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** doesn‚Äôt explain much, other than ‚ÄúTest Apps!‚Äù and offers the shiniest quick-cash bait.  
Here‚Äôs the kicker:

- Their ‚Äúpayout‚Äù threshold is comically high, so you‚Äôre stuck in captcha purgatory for HOURS. 
- Most ‚Äúearnings‚Äù are locked behind yet more fixing, referrals, or survey walls. (Eyeroll.) 
- Want to cash out? Suddenly the requirements double and‚Ä¶well, RIP.  
But here‚Äôs where my **shock** goes full-on disbelief. A friend claims she‚Äôs actually gotten paid after spamming CAPTCHAS like a bot all weekend. Hard to argue with a screenshot of a Venmo payout‚Äîall from **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**. Still‚Ä¶too good to be true? Or is my paranoia making me miss out on the internet‚Äôs wildest grind-for-coffee-money scheme?

- Is this money-for-nothing fantasy real?
- Did you ever break past the first *actual* payout?

1mlzhk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1mlzhk1/explore_best_coffee_makers_with_nespresso_vertuo/,Explore Best Coffee Makers with Nespresso Vertuo Lattissima Review,"The Nespresso Vertuo Lattissima Coffee and Espresso Maker offers an enticing combination of convenience, design, and versatility. As someone who starts each day needing that perfect cup of coffee, I put this machine through its paces over several weeks. It's been my reliable morning companion, and while it excels in many areas, a few quirks stood out to me.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this machine is undeniably sleek and modern. Sitting on my kitchen counter, its matte black and glossy finish looks elegant without being overly flashy. I especially liked how compact it felt, making it suitable for smaller spaces. The detachable milk reservoir adds a layer of practicality, allowing me to store leftover milk in the fridge. However, while the machine‚Äôs materials feel premium, the milk frother and drip tray, which is adjustable, seem a bit delicate‚Äîfine for light use but may not feel as durable for those who make a lot of coffee daily.

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this coffee machine is incredibly straightforward. With its one-touch brewing system, it‚Äôs designed for people who want a quick shot of caffeine without dealing with overly complicated settings. I timed it, and with a 30-second heat-up time, it minimized downtime during busy mornings. The descaling alert was handy, reminding me to clean it regularly to maintain optimal performance. Brewing options are diverse, offering sizes ranging from single espresso shots to large mugs of coffee‚Äîsomething even visiting friends appreciated. However, the machine‚Äôs exclusivity to Nespresso Vertuo capsules limits variety unless you‚Äôre deeply committed to their ecosystem.  

**Key Benefits**  
- The detachable 16 fl. oz milk tank is both practical and dishwasher-safe.  
- Compatible with six brewing sizes, catered beautifully to both coffee and espresso lovers.  
- Inclusive sampler pack helps you explore Nespresso's impressive range of 40+ blends.

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Every cup brewed with this machine felt consistent, with rich flavors coming through in every sip. From velvety espressos to frothy cappuccinos made with its milk frother, the results were caf√©-quality, which left both me and my guests thoroughly impressed. Brewing iced coffee was another highlight, especially during hot afternoons. That said, the machine‚Äôs reliance on compatible pods means you're locked into using official Nespresso capsules, which are not the cheapest on the market. On top of that, some limited-edition blends can be difficult to source when they run out.

**Positives**  
1. Delivers professional-grade coffees and espressos at home.  
2. Offers multiple size options with consistent brewing quality.  
3. One-touch system is ideal for busy schedules or coffee beginners.  

**Shortcomings**  
1. Exclusivity to Nespresso Vertuo capsules limits brewing options.  
2. Some accessory components like the drip tray may feel less durable over time.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other brands, such as Keurig or Breville espresso makers, the Nespresso Vertuo Lattissima outshines competitors with its milk frothing system and capsule convenience. Keurig machines are often restricted in coffee quality and lack the robust espresso feature here, while Breville machines, though excellent for serious espresso aficionados, tend to be more expensive and involve a steeper learning curve. However, Breville offers more grind control if you're someone who‚Äôs picky about beans over capsules.

**Value for Price**  
This coffee maker lands in the higher-tier price range for capsule machines, but if you value versatility and premium design, it‚Äôs worth considering. Over time, however, the cost of capsules could add up compared to traditional ground coffee setups. For me, this trade-off was manageable due to the consistent results and convenience, but it‚Äôs worth weighing beforehand.

Could it be microleakage?,"Had a crown placed about a year ago. From the start, it felt off, the fit seemed poor to me and it was very irritated at first from a high bite. I‚Äôve had three adjustments since then, and the bite feels better with each one, but the tooth still flares up from time to time.

The sensitivity is very mild and comes and goes, sometimes it‚Äôs fine for a week, other times it‚Äôs a low-grade annoyance. It‚Äôs not affected by heat or cold, and the biting sensitivity has gotten better with the adjustments, and X-rays haven‚Äôt shown anything obvious. The only thing that will sometimes trigger the sensitivity is from certain liquids or food, like coffee (not from the heat). My dentist has said the fit and seal looks good. Cold tests show the nerve is responding normally, or close to it.

But at the same time, I‚Äôve also noticed a similar ‚Äúleakage‚Äù sensation under an old amalgam filling, which my dentist says does have some leakage going on, which makes me wonder if my teeth are just more sensitive to very small imperfections in the seal? Or maybe there is a minor imperfection with the seal of the crown? My dentist seems to think it might just be taking an extra long time to recover from the crown placement. And it was replacing a big filling, but the decay wasn't too close to the pulp. So maybe it's just more sensitive now?

Has anyone else dealt with this? Could intermittent irritation still be microleakage even if it doesn‚Äôt show on an X-ray? And if it is, would replacing the crown be the only real fix?

I'm going to the endo next week and will have him take a look at it, but I think the root will come back looking healthy again. I'm just a bit puzzled by it at this point, but if there is some sort of leakage going on I want to have it addressed to prevent any decay forms underneath the crown.",2,1754771527.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

When at an extremely important, yet entirely unfortunate part, of a universes‚Äô creation, it gets dropped and suddenly a tree (which has absolutely no right in being there) has appeared at its‚Äô core; one would assume it‚Äôs creators would throw it away and start again. It was however the last of the stardust they‚Äôd just used‚Ä¶
‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be alright won‚Äôt it?‚Äù A thunderous voice bellowed from within the dark nothingness.
‚ÄúNah, it‚Äôs buggered.‚Äù A second announced knowingly. ‚ÄúLook at the consistency of it, the stardust is getting into all the places it shouldn‚Äôt do. It won‚Äôt work like it‚Äôs s‚Äôposed to.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôll have to do‚Äù A third, more assertive yet altogether disappointed voice spoke from the abyss.
And thus was the creation of the known universe; despite various differing accounts of shamans, priests and holy-men alike, who all seem to have something to say on the topic.  Woden, and his brothers, Wilo and Wiha, had been tasked with shaping the matter of the universe into a functioning, law abiding, system of rules and regulations. It was a job they now feared they wouldn‚Äôt have for much longer. 
The tree now floated at the centre of space and time, its roots and branches growing quickly, like a bed of writhing eels. They slithered and wriggled between themselves, intertwining as if reaching out for one-another. Amongst these tendrils, the three entities now watched, small particles of the stardust come swirling together to form burning lights .
‚ÄúWell that definitely shouldn‚Äôt be happening‚Äù The voice known as Wilo said, pointing out the obvious.
‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre right brother.‚Äù Came the reply from Wiha. ‚ÄúDefinitely not suppose‚Äô to be doin‚Äô that.‚Äù
Woden was the eldest of the three and somewhat the wiser of the brothers. It hadn‚Äôt taken him long at all to realise what was going on:
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs life you fools! The impact must have compacted too much of the dust together in one space.‚Äù Woden spoke.
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt life suppose‚Äô to come later on, once we‚Äôve designed all the creatures big n‚Äô small, and named ‚Äòem?‚Äù
Woden thought about this for a moment. This series of events his brother was describing was the usual way things worked, as Woden well knew having had done this same routine some 60 billion times before - but there was no other answer for what was happening before them. It had to be life. Only this version of it wasn‚Äôt a well thought out script that had to play by their universal laws. This one seemed to play by it‚Äôs own.
‚ÄúWell err‚Ä¶ Yes‚Ä¶ Usually.‚Äù He eventually replied. ‚ÄúBut I think that knock may have messed with the fundamental nature of this one. It appears as if life has, for absolutely no reason that had anything to do with us, simply sparked itself into existence.‚Äù
‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ Bollocks..‚Äù.

The carriage shuddered as it came to a sudden stop, its wheels screeching over the wet cobblestones, spraying puddle water up onto the coach box. Two cloaked figures sat perched upon it, illuminated only by a sliver of moonlight that had taken the opportunity to escape from between a gap in the rain clouds.
‚ÄúI hate the evenings this time of year‚Äù came a grumble from the driver; the words appearing in the frigid air as wafts of steam.
‚ÄúWe all do Lum, it's the sodding rain. Park her up while I go find out what's going on‚Äù. The second figure sprung down from the carriage landing with a splatter in the stream of rainwater that had formed at the side of the carriageway. They repositioned their heavy waxed cloak in an effort to keep the worst of the deluge out. An attempt that in all honesty wasn't working; a point highlighted by the fact that the cheap leather boots worn by the figure had already let in water.
The shape appeared to shrug, then made its way towards a small doorway just off the road, sheltered under an overhanging first floor as the rattling of the carriage disappeared around a narrow street corner.
On either side of the cheap wooden door to what was honestly little more than a poorly kept and dingy set of rooms, were two more cloaked silhouettes, busying themselves in whispered conversation. They had found what must have been the only available dry spot, a narrow strip under the overhang, their backs forced right up against the wall. The faces of the pair were intermittently illuminated by the amber glow of a cigarette the larger of the two was smoking. The squelching of approaching footsteps caught their attention, bringing the smaller of the pair abruptly to an upright position.
‚ÄúYou the boys from Ascett?‚Äù Asked the larger of the figures through a lungful of cigarette smoke, tossing the butt to the floor and extinguishing it on the cobblestones with an expert twist of his boot. The voice was gruff and gave the impression they‚Äôd spent one too many nights standing around in the frigid rain. ‚ÄúAbout time you showed your faces. We were only supposed to be lending a hand with this. What's your name anyway son?‚Äù
A match was suddenly struck close to their face, lighting another cigarette which now hung between the lips of what appeared to be a huge bearded man. The flickering light from the flame unveiled a rugged face that had been weathered by perhaps 40 winters or so, although their eyes gave away that they were likely younger.
‚ÄúYou know what it's like. Boss is trying to run several jobs in this town and there‚Äôs only so many of us to go round. The name‚Äôs Briggs by the way.‚Äù
Briggs had learned fairly quickly that the old sweats seemed to respect you more if you mirrored their attitude of seemingly being fed up by the fact you were still breathing at the end of the day.
The bearded man nodded approvingly, then ushered his smaller counterpart over with a wave of his hand. 
‚ÄúThis here‚Äôs, Mouse. He‚Äôs new to the family but he'll fill you in on what we've got here so far‚Äù
The skinny figure that was Mouse, now lurching towards Briggs, was quite noticeably an academy leaver. He was dressed in a clean and recently pressed black uniform, its brass buttons highly polished and glinting in the cigarette light. It was an odd reflection for Briggs, to think that only a few years ago that had been him. His buttons had long since turned green and matted from oxidation, and his trousers were more or less held together at this point, by a complex patchwork of stitching where they‚Äôd been ripped and torn on so many occasions.
Mouse stood rigidly as he puffed out his chest, trying his best to appear confident, before he meekly squeaked out the words:  
‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ at this point, to be honest‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre thinking, well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs, err‚Ä¶ a bit odd‚Äù
‚ÄúA bit odd?‚Äù The bearded man roared with laughter. ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs certainly one way of putting it! There‚Äôs cadavers in there without no bleedin‚Äô eyes!‚Äù
Briggs felt his eyes roll as he let out an audible sigh that floated in the night. The thought of bodies behind that flimsy door with holes where the eyes should be, filled him with the sudden realisation that this wasn‚Äôt going to be a quick job. He had been hoping for an easy shift this evening. He‚Äôd not been able to sleep the day through before leaving for work, and no amount of the strong sticky black tar that was the station coffee had been able to revive him.
Briggs had joined the watchmen in the hope that he would be chasing criminals and just this, dealing with suspicious dead bodies. And to many, that was all the job was. All the novels and tales he‚Äôd heard basically glamorized the solving of the puzzle of who done it.  However, now that he was suddenly faced with the situation in the flesh, Briggs couldn‚Äôt help but be filled with dread.
‚ÄúWell this is going to be a lot of paperwork‚Ä¶‚Äù he thought to himself out loud. ‚ÄúHave you sent for the watch sergeant yet?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, sent for ‚Äòem practically soon as we opened the door. Proper weird in there, you wanna take a look?‚Äù came the reply from behind the beard.
‚ÄúMight want to cover your face though, it stinks in there.‚Äù squeaked Mouse through a grimace.
Briggs found himself edging forwards. He hadn‚Äôt really planned to go in at this point, but the morbid curiosity of human nature seemed to be dragging him towards the door, his hand reaching out towards the doorknob.
He was suddenly brought back to reality by the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps. That must be Lum back from the carriage he thought to himself. As he turned, he noticed the silhouette of his partner jogging towards them, a lamp extended before him hanging from his right arm swinging excitedly from the maneuver. 
‚ÄúFlipping rain!‚Äù Lum exclaimed grumpily as he drew closer, hurrying himself into the slither of dryness up against the wall.
‚ÄúNo eyes Lum‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúGuessing they didn‚Äôt see it coming then?‚Äù Lum chuckled under his breath. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ this is gonna take all night.‚Äù He stated to the group. ‚ÄúYou gone in yet?‚Äù
‚ÄúNah‚Äù replied Briggs ‚ÄúThese two have, but better not until sarge arrives, just in case we mess up something evidential. You guys will probably have to stay to brief him when he gets here since you‚Äôve already gone in‚Äù he said, pointing towards the other two with a tilt of his head.
The group elected that this was for the best through a collective nodding of their heads in agreement. If there was one thing you didn‚Äôt want to do in their profession, it was to upset a senior watchman. They had a nasty and rather creative imagination for coming up with ways to repay the favor.

The four tried their best to remain in the thin patch of dryness for what felt like hours, the cold and rain whipping the faces of them all, bar the large bearded man who seemed unfazed by the weather, content in his chain smoking of what appeared to Briggs, to be a seemingly endless supply of cigarettes. 
As it approached what felt like midnight, Briggs watched as a chubby little man across the street poked his balding head out from a door to guard his small yappy dog that had sprinted out from between his legs, whilst it went about its business on the wet cobbles. The man made no attempt to clean up the mess before quickly closing the door once the dog had returned. Briggs couldn‚Äôt really blame him considering the weather.
The distinctive sound of the clip-clopping of a carriage could be heard approaching shortly after. The noise of metal horseshoes striking the cobbles echoed into the night, getting louder as they drew closer. A large black wagon pulled up, a single driver sat atop the coach box. Briggs recognised the driver from the Ascett station. It was Sergeant Fielding. A large, burly chap with an appetite for solving crime, and what appeared to be an even larger appetite for anything served with an alcohol content and from a keg - this had left him over the years, with a permanent red glow to his face and nose, and the inability to formulate a whole sentence without a hiccup randomly occupying the space between his words.
Briggs hadn't often worked alongside Sergeant Fielding, which probably was, in large part due to the fact the sergeant could usually be found slumped over a table in the station bar, but the sergeant had always seemed considerably friendly for a senior watchman, giving a nod of acknowledgement when passing Briggs at the station. 
‚ÄúWell, well, *hic!* Well‚Ä¶ next of kin in the *hic!*, err‚Ä¶ shackles yet then? *Hic!*‚Äù Said the sergeant, a hand clutched to his chest and sounding to Briggs as if suffering from indigestion.
This was fairly normal protocol for jobs relating to dead bodies. Usually if there had been suspicion of foul play, the grimy finger of the law would stery point straight in the face of the spouse or estranged child and yell: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nicked!‚Äù, and nine times out of ten with little to no evidence they were hanged the next day, thus proving their guilt on the matter. Well that was the way things normally went anyhow. Briggs however was more of a new school ideologist on the concept of criminal thinking, and felt that asking a few questions before opening the trapdoor usually left him with a lot less explaining to do the next day, when inevitably, little Miss Miggins came in with a vital piece of exonerating evidence just moments after a flock of ravens rustled and squaked into the air following the sound of a loud, intense ‚Äòcrack‚Äô of rope.
It occurred to Briggs that the senior management really ought to find a better place for this kind of evidence. The carpets at the station were after all becoming a trip hazard, and he was surprised more Watchmen hadn't been given the sack. You‚Äôd need a fair few sacks to clean up the amount of stuff that had been kicked under that musty green material over the years he thought.
‚ÄúNo Sergeant!‚Äù Blurted out Mouse. ‚ÄúWatchmen present all agreed to preserve the scene and handover to yourself, Sergeant!‚Äù. 
‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ *hic!*... Junior, err.. watchman..? *hic!*‚Äù Came the reply from the sergeant, his eyelids forced into a squint as if they were trying to catch the name of this young beanpole of a watchman from flying off into the night.
‚ÄúNarrowford, Sergeant!‚Äù
‚ÄúRight.. right.. yes.. *hic!*. Quite right anyhow. You must always wait for the senior watch-*hic!*-man, to err, assess the scene before rushing off and making, err‚Ä¶ *hic!* Decisions for yourself, ha ha!‚Äù Sergeant Fielding clambered down from atop his carriage, a feint which was rather unglamorous. Dismounted, with a spin and landed in front of the four seeking refuge from the rain, swaying forward and back with his arms straight out to the sides, before blowing out a sigh of effort, and walking towards the group.
‚ÄúLet's, err‚Ä¶ let's *hic!*, have a look inside then shall we?‚Äù

When at an extremely important, yet entirely unfortunate part, of a universes‚Äô creation, it gets dropped and suddenly a tree (which has absolutely no right in being there) has appeared at its‚Äô core; one would assume it‚Äôs creators would throw it away and start again. It was however the last of the stardust they‚Äôd just used‚Ä¶
‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be alright won‚Äôt it?‚Äù A thunderous voice bellowed from within the dark nothingness.
‚ÄúNah, it‚Äôs buggered.‚Äù A second announced knowingly. ‚ÄúLook at the consistency of it, the stardust is getting into all the places it shouldn‚Äôt do. It won‚Äôt work like it‚Äôs s‚Äôposed to.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôll have to do‚Äù A third, more assertive yet altogether disappointed voice spoke from the abyss.
And thus was the creation of the known universe; despite various differing accounts of shamans, priests and holy-men alike, who all seem to have something to say on the topic.  Woden, and his brothers, Wilo and Wiha, had been tasked with shaping the matter of the universe into a functioning, law abiding, system of rules and regulations. It was a job they now feared they wouldn‚Äôt have for much longer.

1mlzef7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNightTales/comments/1mlzef7/bad_mouse/,Bad Mouse,"It all started on a sunny summer day in 2009 when three separate packages arrived on the doorsteps of the Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney studios. They were anonymous packages with no postmarks or return addresses. No one saw them being delivered, and each had only a simple note attached which read ‚ÄúI have created something I love. From me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù. Strange, but the recipients decided to humor the packages anyway, thinking it was fanmail or something of the sort. When they were opened, they revealed several video tapes.



They all had titles hastily scribbled on, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 1‚Äù, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 2‚Äù, and so on. There were 13 in total, the last of which had an additional notation reading ‚ÄúThis is the last‚Äù. As to the contents of the tapes, they contained what everyone assumed to be ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù, who was a mouse sock puppet, complete with two large ears, eyes, and buck teeth all clearly made with paper, but it had arms that were clearly stitched on in post and a cartoony tail that did not match the rest of the sock puppet.



All of the tapes were in black and white, and had very simple premises. In a high-pitched and nasally voice, Bad Mouse talked about numbers, the alphabet, animals, colors, and other really straightforward topics. They were only about four or five minutes long each, with no background music, title cards, or anything. Just Bad Mouse talking.



Nothing was too unusual or frightening about the ‚Äúshow‚Äù, so to speak. Clearly, it was done on a very low budget, but what exactly was the point of it? It surely would not entertain anyone over the age of three. Some dismissed it as some kind of stupid prank, while others joked that whoever delivered these tapes to the studios was banking on Bad Mouse being made into an actual show. Unfortunately, that was not how it worked, and after all the episodes were viewed and everyone got a good laugh at someone‚Äôs pitiful attempt at stardom, the episodes were all dismissed and promptly canned, though there were some who found Bad Mouse to be unsettling and creepy, but they would never bring that up in front of their colleagues.



That was supposed to be the end of it, but just one week later, more packages arrived, with the note now reading ‚ÄúFrom me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù, the ‚ÄúI have something I love‚Äù being notably omitted. Inside the packages were 13 tapes, just like last time, and when everyone gathered to watch them, they were actually surprised. While each episode was about the same length as before, the show actually had color, plots, music, title cards, more sock puppet characters, and environments, though it was still clearly made on the smallest ounce of a budget.



The visuals and effects were shoddy at best, whoever was voicing Bad Mouse clearly voiced the other sock puppet characters, there was a strange hum of static in the background, and occasionally a loud beeping noise came from out of nowhere and bloodied the ears of all who heard it. Needless to say, it was not nearly enough to convince the executives to even fathom the idea of greenlighting it, and Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network all tossed the tapes into the garbage.



‚ÄúBad Mouse is getting desperate!‚Äù a Nickelodeon executive quipped after sipping his coffee.



Was that the end of it? Everyone thought so until another week had passed and three more packages just bearing the words ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù arrived at each studio, and all three went straight to the trash can. However, a curious Cartoon Network intern secretly fished their package out of the trash. He had heard of Bad Mouse‚Äôs depravity from his colleagues, and as an avid collector of lost and unknown media on the side, this would be absolutely perfect for him. He took the tapes home and immediately popped them into his old VCR.



Judging by the small increase in quality in the second round of packages, the intern assumed that whoever was behind Bad Mouse had finally learned their lesson, but each tape showed a disturbing clip of the same thing: no color, no plots, no music, no title cards, no other characters, and no environments‚Ä¶just Bad Mouse sitting motionless and staring straight at the camera. Every thirty seconds or so, the sock puppet would say the words ‚ÄúGetting desperate‚Äù, but only in syllables:



‚ÄùGet‚Ä¶ting‚Ä¶des‚Ä¶per‚Ä¶ate‚Äù.



The intern did not scare too easily, and he did not think much of it other than it being pretty odd. Shrugging, he popped the tapes out of the old VCR, placed them with his other tapes and DVDs he had acquired throughout the years, and went to bed.



No more packages showed up after that. No more tapes. No more Bad Mouse. The whole ordeal seemed to be over‚Ä¶and it was. Until about a year later, when Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network‚Äôs channels were all hijacked.



By this point, everyone had basically forgotten about Bad Mouse. It was now just a fleeting memory of some desperate and depraved soul thinking they would make it big, something to bring up if you wanted to point and laugh. But the first signs of trouble were on Nickelodeon, specifically Nick Jr.



The characters Moose and Zee had in-between blocks where they provided information and education between shows. On the morning of July 12, 2010, a segment where Moose was supposed to teach the audience about names was hijacked by none other than Bad Mouse. In the middle of speaking, Moose went frozen and silent, the music cut out, and the screen glitched until Bad Mouse was there for the entire world to see.



Though no one watching at home could recognize what they were seeing, the network executives certainly did. Bad Mouse spoke to a bunny character (which was clearly just a stuffed animal and was aptly named ""Bunny"") about the importance of sharing. The mouse sock puppet ripped a toy truck out of Bunny's hands and ran away laughing, and Bunny just stood there, staring at the camera for about a minute. After that, it switched to a scene of Bad Mouse riding a little bike through a very poorly made cardboard field. A kindergarten play could create better sets than Bad Mouse ever could. He sang this song that sounded like complete nonsense in a voice that would make ears bleed.



""That petty asshole..."" said one network executive. It seemed that if they did not air Bad Mouse, then Bad Mouse was just going to do it themself.



The network executives were too embarrassed to simply power down the channel over what was definitely a stupid prank. They thought just slapping the technical difficulties screen on it would do the trick every time, but that did not stop Bad Mouse. For the next two weeks, all the shows on air were cut off and the broadcasts became a mess due to Bad Mouse jumbling everything up.



Bad Mouse would always return, just playing the same 13 crappy episodes on repeat. Calls were made by angry parents and their confused children, and each channel promised to resolve the issues, but they never could. While all three channels were determined to solve the issues, in the grand scheme of things, no one took them \*that\* seriously. They came off as more annoying than anything.



Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network made it absolutely clear that this was \*not\* their doing and that their broadcasts had been hijacked, and they did not know who it was or where it was coming from. With those statements out to linger in the air, the internet began to fill with rumors and speculation. Everyone was curious about the problems their children‚Äôs channels were having. There were still people assuming it was just a very clever prank and was the work of people who had nothing better to do but get a rise out of these channels and their viewers.



Others had‚Ä¶darker theories, many of them poked and made fun of for being just as stupid as Bad Mouse itself, ranging from Bad Mouse being the work of a disgruntled employee, an artificial intelligence, a paranormal phenomenon, aliens, or some kind of supernatural or superhuman entity. In today‚Äôs world, we are all pretty cynical and seem to disregard more dramatic notions because it does not align with our short-ordered view of reality.



Despite the many rumors, as July came to a close, things seemed to be getting better. By then, the executives at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney had found a way to block out all the messaging and instead broadcast either a default bumper or a continuous feed of static for the channels until they could figure out the issue. As a result, the hijackings had slowed down significantly.



By September 1st, there was no more hijackings at all, so it seemed that Bad Mouse had simply moved on to other things. Everyone was relieved, but there was still the occasional hushed murmur that whoever was behind these hijackings would be back, because clearly, Bad Mouse seemed like a persistent weirdo. Some even went so far as to say that Bad Mouse would bring violence with it, which was laughed off as completely and utterly ridiculous.



How very wrong those people were.



For a long time, there was nothing, like before. All of it was the calm before the storm, and boy, did it storm. 2011 was coming and going with nothing unusual happening. SpongeBob cooked Krabby Patties, Mickey Mouse took us on adventures around his clubhouse, and The Amazing World of Gumball was premiering its first season to massive success. Even the once active internet forums were completely empty, with Bad Mouse just being touted as a fun, if bizarre, little piece of lost media that was stuck in the past. All was well until the summer arrived‚Ä¶



There were so many more hijackings. All three networks were affected. Instead of just being Bad Mouse episodes, they were much more...disturbing. Each one lasted anywhere from 15 minutes to a full hour, depending on the severity, and each one was worse than the last. Beginning the same way, either flickering, frames repeating themselves, sound not syncing up, waving and jittering, or random pauses, something would always happen. Sometimes the screens would be replaced with deeply disturbing edits of whatever character was on screen, often making them appear angry at the audience.



Sometimes, the screen would fade into bloodied static for a few moments, then go right back to normal programming. Sometimes random images and videos would flash on the screen, such as a pictures of the White House on fire, footage of mice, someone walking outside at night, and random YouTube videos, but there was also disturbing imagery of people being tortured, mutilated, beheaded, people being shot at point-blank range, and even all manners of illegal pornography. Sometimes, an extremely loud beeping sound would bloody the ears of all who heard it (not unlike what was heard in the first Bad Mouse video tapes), blocking out everything that was being said. Sometimes vague or threatening messages were displayed such as:



‚Äúi‚Äôm here‚Äù‚Äô



‚Äúis it getting desperate?‚Äù



‚Äúi hate you all‚Äù



‚Äúi have to get attention‚Äù



‚Äúi‚Äôm desperate!‚Äù



‚Äúyou love me, but I don‚Äôt love you‚Äù



‚Äúbad mouse is getting desperate!‚Äù



‚Äúi‚Äôm going to show you the world‚Äù



‚Äúbad mouse is getting worse!‚Äù



‚Äúme me me me me me‚Äù



‚Äúattention‚Äù



Some even claimed to see images of Bad Mouse himself in the background of scenes of terror and bloodshed, though those were usually not very clear. Occasionally, a clip of Bad Mouse would be shown and then just disappear. All of this was absolutely chilling, especially considering it was shown to young children, but it was far from over. During a hijacking of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on the morning of July 25, a message from Bad Mouse claimed that August 12 would be ‚Äúdeath day‚Äù. Everyone‚Äôs blood ran cold. What did Bad Mouse mean? No one could know, but the message was already out there, so everyone braced for the worst.



Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all in a panic. They cut all broadcasts, including off-air and live shows, and immediately called up their network technicians. To everyone‚Äôs horror, the technicians were unable to locate the origin of the hijackings. They could find no source, no one was even able to log in to the programming or mess with the technical equipment, and no technician was able to determine the cause. There was no foreign software or anything of the sort.



Security cameras showed no suspicious activity. Arguments ensued, fingers were pointed, hardworking employees were fired without warning, and the situation looked grimmer and grimmer. This was an all-out war, and no one knew why it was happening or how to stop it.



By August, the situation had spiraled out of control. It was no longer just a technical issue, but an outright attack on the three major children‚Äôs networks. The situation spiraled into full chaos, with Bad Mouse still unstoppable and the networks still in chaos. By now, all the technicians who were responsible for maintaining these networks and getting them up and running had been fired, leaving all the channel‚Äôs executives at a loss of what to do. All they could do was wait and see.



On August 12, the atmospheres at the three studios were tense. They made the conscious decision to stay open, not wishing to appear weak or stupid, and wanting to show Bad Mouse that they were not afraid of it. Their broadcasts of beloved children‚Äôs shows began as normal. For a while, everything actually seemed relatively normal. No hijackings happened yet, but just as everyone at the studios were beginning to think that they might be okay, something happened, a massacre of unimaginable brutality, a tragedy of such a scale that the world would never be the same again.



In a little over half an hour, six napalm bombs went off, two at each studio. In the blink of an eye, 115 people were dead and hundreds more were injured. They came out of nowhere, with no warning, and no way to tell who, what, or where they came from. One Nickelodeon employee, Mike Ewart, was speaking with a colleague near the front doors. One moment, she was laughing and smiling, sipping her Starbucks coffee, and the next, she was completely and utterly obliterated. Ewart said that ""it was like slow motion...I saw her body just vaporize. I felt her warmth just vanish. I felt her coffee splash on me. I was just numb.‚Äù



The police found a lone Bad Mouse sock puppet lying amongst the rubble at the Disney Studio, charred and damn near impossible to identify what it even was. That was all they had to go on for physical evidence besides the bombs themselves, which were found to be homemade devices filled with both black powder and a highly flammable petrochemical substance, both of which were placed in three-gallon plastic gas containers. Each one was placed in dense areas within each target to maximize the death toll.



A task force of hundreds of police officers from all over the country and federal agencies converged on all three studios. Thousands of leads were investigated, and they all came up empty. No one saw any suspicious activity at any time in any of the studios, and no one knew who could have or would have done such a horrific thing. FBI analysts even took a look at the original tapes, the ones that were rejected by the three studios, to see if there was something they missed. Still...nothing.



All three targets were devastated, but the Nickelodeon building received the greatest damage, with three fifths of the building destroyed. Much of the buildings were rendered uninhabitable by the immense heat and force of the explosions, and while they have since been repaired and remodeled, the damaged portions have been sealed off and turned into memorials.



The perpetrator behind Bad Mouse is a mystery. No suspects or leads were ever found. Clearly, they were a lunatic with an insane dream that they wanted to see realized, who wanted to make a big impact on the world. They went off the deep end when their show was rejected. Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney all closed for months after the incident and are still getting back on their feet today.



As time went on, people began to wonder why the networks would never make a statement on the incident. Many thought that maybe it would scare everyone away from watching their programming, but there's definitely more to it than that. Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all interviewed by the press, but they were extremely vague, simply saying that they were still working on ‚Äúa little something‚Äù to pay their respects to the victims and they never commented on Bad Mouse itself.



But the scars still exist. Bad Mouse is still burned into the minds of those who lived through it, and many are too afraid to talk about it or discuss the memories they have, but a few brave souls have come forward to share their experiences through interviews and documentaries. Even the intern was interviewed, though he wished to remain anonymous.



No one knows who Bad Mouse really is, and no one ever will. People have wanted to know more about the perpetrator of such a heinous crime. It was beyond obvious what their motivations were, but the question of whoever was encrypted as Bad Mouse, much like Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer, will simply never be known.



All we know is that a disturbed and depraved mind exists somewhere in the world, and for that, the world is an ever scarier and darker place.

I came from a Smeg, which was a bad experience honestly. You‚Äôre paying the logo with that brand!

M35, 6""2. Early to mid 20's in good shape, 80kg ish doing events like Tough Mudder, wolf runs etc.

Starting at around 122kg, regular home exercise (indoor bike, more walking, heavy bag and weights) and office gym when possible, healthier meals and smaller portions, I dropped to 107kg quite quickly but consistently. I am on roughly 1,200 - 1,500 solid calories, with more from coffee and alcohol (I know I shouldn't but do).

I am tracking calorie burning through pixel watch, and started until July aiming for 3,200, upped to 3,400 since July.

I have not lost anything since July, which is very disheartening as it was coming down so consistently before and has been 4 or so weeks with little weight improvement, though the exercise is getting easier, hence the intensity increase (especially on the heavy bag and bike, moving to minimum 400 tracked calories burnt per session which is roughly 25 / 45 minutes per session respectively).

Without the alcohol (I am not ready to stop yet), I need advice or encouragement to keep going. My target weight for now is 95kg, with a further goal of sub 90kg.

A few years back I also read ""The Scum villains Self-Saving System"" (i loved the first 2 books especially, because the humor was so good I couldn't stop laughing. A bit like the ones i mentioned before in a way)

So I wanted to ask if people had any recommendation with similar vibes? Most of my other books on my TBR are thrillers and such, but I guess I am craving for something cute and funny, bonus if there is romance as well (yes, I'm a big romantasy fan)

# WATCH NFL LIVE STREAM

With the advent of internet streaming, it‚Äôs made cable a pretty outdated service. Unfortunately, there isn‚Äôt really a good place to watch sports online. I‚Äôve tried purchasing a streaming service that gives you access to NFL games, but I was also paying for a bunch of channels I never even watched. Talk about a waste of money!

But what if I told you I found a place to watch an NFL live game without cable?

Awesome, right?¬†

I found this awesome place that streams all NFL games online for free. And I didn‚Äôt even have to sign up!

If you‚Äôve tried to watch NFL games online before, you probably know that the NFL has some pretty strict streaming regulations. They typically want people to watch on TV. But right when I was about to give up and accept their demands, I found this great streaming service.¬†

It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren‚Äôt even in my region. It‚Äôs practically heaven on Earth!

But let‚Äôs delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?

I have access to every NFL game everywhere

Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don‚Äôt give you access to all the available games? Crazy right?¬†

Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn‚Äôt even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.

One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?

I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like.¬†

Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I‚Äôm getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.

I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free.¬†

Which channels do I have access to?

You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn‚Äôt the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn‚Äôt on one of the channels, I can see that, too!

But what about the video quality?

It doesn‚Äôt do you any good to have access to all these games if you can‚Äôt see anything, right?

Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your internet can handle it, anyway. But don‚Äôt worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I‚Äôve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn‚Äôt have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!

After all, what‚Äôs the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything‚Äôs buffering all the time.

In the end,

I finally don‚Äôt have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn‚Äôt have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!

This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn‚Äôt be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I‚Äôve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch.¬†

And if you use this service, you can too.

Mr.crabs and the Baburd went into heated debate about mother who was on the  isles of mists fortune. eventually, the topic of manifest destiny and the purpose of life came up. 

""you know, the moon is of strategic importance to our survival as a species. we could just... take it. its not like anyone cares or anything."" mused the great Baburd.  ""maybe we will find more savages to educate as well."" 

""ermmm... perhaps. but how do you plan to get there? its not like sailing, or outright piracy on the high seas."" the thoughtform named mr.crabs  questioned. ""furthermore, what will become of your people?""

""DAMN IT ALL!!!"" slammed the fist of the Baburd into the imaginary ikea coffee table. ""there's mathematics at play here.  i dont care what happens to my people so long as they survive and maintain their right to self determination.  the more islands we inhabit, the better chances of crisis survival we have.  those chances grow exponentially with every island in the sky we take too!!""

""you seem upset boyo."" observed mr.crabs. ""why?""

The great Baburd grimaced. ""i don't get to be happy.""

this only confused the thoughtform more.

""in taking on my leadership role, i understood one thing. i don't get to be happy anymore. there will always be decisions to make with utmost urgency. i may delegate to ease my job, i may feign happiness to ease the anxiety of my underlings. but i am never happy. there is always a citizen suffering somehow, SOMEWHERE because the system isnt *perfect*.""

mr. crabs took on the psychiatrist getup and suddenly started sounding Russian.  
  
""now this is interesting.  but have you considered that there is no such thing as a perfect system?"" the thoughtform echoed as reality seemed to collapse once again, and the Baburd woke up again.   

his servants got him thru the royal routine and eventually he would meet with the goblin Sorcella over the orb to discuss progress on project downeaster alexa. 

seemed that g-day was a success.  but mr.crabs was always there. sometimes speaking for the Baburd.  

  
the usual shipment of brass, zinc, copper, Exhailian glass products, alchemically treated seaweed denim, and 100,000 canned foods were sent out. WORTHLESS eon notes began to fill the coffers of the great Baburd,  one would think that there would be teeth in the coffers of the great Baburd, but the teeth are always redistributed to public funding of projects that benefit Exhailian citizens. to leave teeth in the coffers invites waste as the teeth rot over time. 

in Exhailia waste is a sin. 

as of late, the new industrial vizier, aptly named ""gears"" by the Baburd invented something called... the calculator. 

sadly, this  hand crank brass gear hulk abomination that fits in the palm of the Baburd's hand seemed useless. 

""we can already do math gears... what use have we for this?""  sighed the Baburd. 

""duh.."" exclaimed gears. she made a silly expression. ""we sell this to the nongobs. they like convenience.. this uses no mana, so it doesn't ever lose its value even when wet because its made of brass."" 

Then the Baburd approved, and encouraged new gearhulk computers to be designed for sale abroad.

It was just after 11 at night. Isabelle Berry, having finished her nightly routine, sat on the edge of the bed engrossed in a book.

The bathroom door suddenly opened, and Raiden Galloway emerged, towel-drying his hair.

His robe was loosely tied, revealing his well-defined muscles, with droplets of water from his damp hair falling onto the plush carpet.

As he approached, Isabelle set aside her book and turned off her bedside lamp.

Raiden climbed into bed, switching off the light on his side. Almost immediately, he rolled over, his body enveloping hers, his freshly showered scent mixing with a gentle kiss.

Once the lights went off, Raiden became both tender and intense.

His usual daytime demeanor of disinterest vanished, leaving Isabelle to marvel at how a man normally so detached and seemingly desireless could transform into someone so fervent and unrestrained in the privacy of their bedroom.

Their connection seemed flawless, filled with intense moments that slowly quieted down into the stillness of the night.

Isabelle found herself wrapped in Raiden's embrace, their skin slightly sticky from sweat, yet she made no move to distance herself.

Instead, she returned his embrace, resting her head against his chest.

""Raiden,"" she murmured, her voice breathy from exertion.

His features were strikingly handsome, defined by sharp angles and a high, prominent nose that lent him a cold, aloof air, especially as he inclined his head slightly.

Despite the intimacy they had just shared, his expression remained composed and detached, his usual stern demeanor undisturbed.

""Hmm?"" His voice, husky and inviting, filled the silence of the night.

""Let's get a divorce,"" Isabelle said softly, feeling him stiffen slightly at her words.

She dismissed it as her imagination. How could a man so guarded and detached show any real reaction to her words?

In truth, Raiden had not wronged her in any way‚Äîhe simply did not love her.

Their marriage had not been born out of affection, so the absence of love was not a failure.

She had harbored a secret affection for this man from her sweet 16 until her composed 24, but now, her feelings had waned.

The room was enveloped in a protracted silence, amplifying Isabelle's growing unease.

Raiden's eyes, dark and penetrating, seemed to merge with the shadowy room, reflecting a deep, consuming darkness.

He finally broke the silence, his voice trembling slightly, ""The reason.""

""Our union was dictated by the circumstances of the child we never had. Perhaps it was never meant to be,"" she responded with a measured calmness, meeting his intense gaze. ""I've grown accustomed to solitude. Life seems unchanged with or without you, but alone, my expectations are fewer, and my life simpler. You likely feel the same.""

Her words hinted at the relief of no longer dealing with his family or hers post-divorce‚Äîeach no longer burdened by the other's demanding relatives.

Raiden's expression was unreadable as he gazed at her. A flicker of pain briefly crossed his features, obscured by the dim light.

Isabelle waited, thinking he might remain silent, but he nodded in agreement, his voice clear but simple, ""Okay.""

His acceptance was as straightforward and resolute as his proposal had been‚Äîan echo of the man she knew so well.

A bittersweetness tinged Isabelle's smile as emotions welled up within her. She had desired this end, yet the resolution left a hollow ache in her heart.

Memories intruded her thoughts‚Äîof seeing Raiden at the company with a vibrant woman delivering him documents.

Her name was Katie Bailey. When Isabelle was a transfer student who had skipped a grade in high school, she had been classmates with them for a year. Both Raiden and Katie were attractive and academically successful, making them popular in all school activities. There were whispers that the two had a mutual interest in each other, but for some reason, their relationship never materialized, and ultimately, it was Isabelle who ended up with Raiden.

Now, Katie had actually started working at his company.

Raiden might still harbor special feelings for Katie, just as the rumors suggested. Isabelle wondered, if Raiden had married Katie instead, would her own situation have been different?

Lost in her thoughts, Isabelle tried to hold back the sadness welling up in her eyes.

She buried her face in his chest, embracing him tightly one last time.

Raiden initially seemed like he might return her embrace, but his hand stopped midway, falling back as he allowed her to cling to him without reciprocation.

Isabelle finally let go.

""I'm going to freshen up,"" she whispered, attempting to leave the bed when suddenly Raiden grabbed her arm, pulling her back.

Her body landed softly back on the bed, enveloped by his shadow and a barrage of halted kisses that ceased at her evident panic.

Raiden's eyes swirled with a tumultuous storm that slowly subsided into a profound stillness.

Then, he rolled over to lay beside her.

""Go to sleep,"" he said quietly, closing his eyes.

The following morning, Isabelle awoke to find Raiden already gone. The house remained unchanged, making the previous night's events feel almost dreamlike, yet Isabelle knew everything was different now.

Isabelle swiftly packed her belongings, which were few, and thus, she was quick to organize.

She left the keys and the signed divorce papers on the coffee table, casting a final glance around the home she had inhabited for the past two years.

Descending the stairs, she encountered Raiden's mother, Ellie Khan, who was leisurely lounging in a wicker chair, amusing herself with the family cat.

Upon noticing Isabelle descending the stairs, she smirked at the cat, saying, ""You, always sleeping till late, making everyone cater to your every need. You don't earn a penny, yet you're quite the spender, and that belly of yours is so uncooperative. You lack the privileges or status but act entitled‚Äîwhat good are you, huh?""

Her tone was refined and gentle, yet each word dripped with irony.

Isabelle chose to ignore the underlying barbs, offered a brief greeting, and departed, wheeling her luggage behind her.

The door shut behind her, followed by the unmistakable sounds of objects being disturbed and Ellie's curt swearing.

Imagining the scowl that must be twisting Ellie's features, Isabelle found herself longing for the independence she had relished before her marriage. Back then, she was self-sufficient, with no expectations from others, no need for pretense, no appeasement of whims.

Ellie had never truly approved of her, a reality Isabelle had always recognized.

Their worlds were starkly different, and her marriage to Raiden had been nothing short of a fluke‚Äîa twist of fate that had momentarily aligned their disparate paths.

Unaware of Raiden's elite status at the time of their marriage, Isabelle had believed him to be a simple worker like herself, striving just to make ends meet.

Had she known the true breadth of the gulf between their societal standings, she would never have consented to their union‚Äîa marriage devoid of love, conceived out of convenience.

In the early days, Isabelle harbored some faint hopes for their future together, tolerating Ellie's duplicitous treatment behind Raiden's back out of a sense of marital obligation.

Now, resolute in her decision to divorce, she no longer cared for Ellie's opinion or approval.

Pausing outside, she sent Raiden a final message: 'I've left the signed divorce papers on the coffee table. I've assigned all related matters to the lawyer. Please handle the formalities when convenient. I'm leaving now. Take care.'

When Raiden received the message during the meeting, it visibly threw him off.

The people in the room, including Katie who had known him for years, had never seen him look so unsettled.

""Mr. Galloway?"" Katie's voice broke through his reverie, gently prompting him back to the moment.

Raiden glanced her way, set his phone down with deliberate calmness, and picked up the thread of the meeting. Just as the room relaxed, thinking he had regained his composure, he abruptly announced, ""Meeting adjourned."" He snatched up his phone and strode out of the room, leaving everyone exchanging puzzled looks.

""Mr. Galloway, what happened?""Chapter 2 Selling the House

Raiden had rushed home from work, an unusual move during business hours.

The house was clean, its usual state unchanged except for the scattered divorce papers on the coffee table.

Picking up the document, Raiden noted its simplicity; Isabelle had asked for nothing, seemingly desiring to return to her life pre-marriage.

Her signature, elegant and fluid, sat at the bottom of the page.

Raiden stared at the signature on the divorce agreement, lost in thought.

As he contemplated the signature, the sound of the door startled him.

His face, hopeful for a moment, fell when he saw it was Ellie entering, not Isabelle.

Ellie entered the room, taken aback by his abrupt motion.

""What's wrong?"" Ellie asked, catching the swift change in his expression.

""Nothing,"" he answered quietly, ""Why are you here?""

""What do you mean? Can't I come to your house?"" Ellie approached with a casual smile. ""Why did you come back so early today? Isabelle just left."" Only then did she remember Isabelle's departure with her luggage, and she wondered aloud where she might have gone.

Ellie's eyes then caught the document in Raiden's hand. ""What's that?""

As she reached for it, Raiden pressed it down, keeping it out of her reach.

""It's nothing,"" he said, his gaze locking with hers. ""If it's not urgent, you don't need to come here. Isabelle's busy with work. We'll visit when we find the time.""

""What work could she have?"" Ellie started to question dismissively, but she altered her approach. ""Fine.""

She could not help but adding, ""You know, Isabelle has been recuperating for over a year now, and still, no news about a pregnancy. I hope it's not a lingering issue from before. You might want to suggest a hospital visit, just to ensure she can conceive later on.""

Raiden responded firmly, ""I don't want the child.""

Ellie, taken aback by his bluntness, could only look on in surprise.

Raiden then dismissed her curtly, ""You should leave now. Don't come here unless it's urgent.""

Ellie hesitated, opening her mouth as if to object, but ultimately she remained silent under Raiden's stern gaze and exited the room.

Watching the door shut behind her, Raiden surveyed the now-empty house, devoid of any trace of Isabelle. With a heavy sigh, he reached for his phone and dialed his assistant, ""Stefan, set up a meeting with my lawyer for the divorce.""

""What?"" Stefan Martinez's voice carried a tone of disbelief. ""Is this decision really so abrupt?""

...

Isabelle returned to her modest house in the suburbs, a place she had purchased before her marriage.

It was small, just enough for her alone.

It was here, in this very house, where she and Raiden had their fateful one-night stand, an event that unexpectedly led to her pregnancy and subsequently forced them into marriage.

That evening had been an accident, spurred by her friend Andrea Mccoy's insistence that she attend their high school reunion.

Surprisingly, Raiden, who typically shunned such social events, was also present.

After high school, they had drifted apart completely. They did not stay in touch through the class group chat nor attend reunions. They were like ships that passed in the night, briefly crossing paths and then drifting into their respective lives.

Raiden, however, had vanished more completely than most.

Isabelle occasionally tried to gather information about him from old classmates, but no one seemed to know anything about his whereabouts or what he had been up to.

Thus, when Isabelle unexpectedly encountered Raiden, who had been absent for many years, her reaction was a mix of surprise and nervousness. The feelings she had harbored quietly during her youth resurfaced, yet she could not muster the courage to reveal them. Her interactions became guarded and overly polite, particularly noticeable when Raiden sat close enough that their shoulders almost touched, heightening her sense of restraint.

Her anxiety manifested as frequent nibbling and sipping, a facade to mask her discomfort. Unintentionally, she consumed more alcohol than intended.

Out of what seemed like neighborly kindness, Raiden offered to escort her home as the evening wound down.

Living alone and slightly tipsy, though not fully incapacitated, Isabelle struggled with her coordination due to the alcohol.

In her tiny single-room house, Isabelle tripped over shoes left by the doorway just as she came in. She was about to tumble when Raiden, quick to react, caught her, pulling her into his arms from the momentum. The room was still dark, and Raiden had also been drinking. It was unclear whether it was the alcohol or the thrill of the night that caused it, but their eyes met in mid-air. Alone together on a deep, dark night, both slightly inebriated and he the man she had long harbored feelings for, their gazes locked and could not be broken. At this moment, their breaths gradually came closer ...

Isabelle was not one for casual liaisons; she had not even dated before. Yet, under the compelling gaze of Raiden‚Äîthe man she had long secretly admired‚Äîshe found herself lost.

It was the look and the man she had dreamed of time and again.

That night, swept up in the moment, they gave in to a raw, passionate encounter, both novices in love and intimacy.

It was unexpected for Isabelle to learn that Raiden, like her, lacked experience in relationships and intimacy.

Given his social status and striking looks, it was a mystery why he had not been involved with anyone before.

Over two years of knowing him, Isabelle came to understand why Raiden had always been single. His dedication to his career left little room for personal relationships.

His strict upbringing ingrained a sense of discipline and cleanliness in him.

That one night represented an anomaly in his otherwise predictable life.

For Isabelle, too, it was an unexpected deviation.

She had carefully planned her future.

She studied architecture in college and showed promise in the field. Eager to further her education, she began applying to the architecture department at Zuriach Federal Institute of Technology. Yet, her life took an unexpected turn one night.

Confused and adrift after discovering her pregnancy, she ran into Raiden at the hospital where he was visiting his grandfather and happened to see her test results.

Raiden proposed they marry and raise the child together.

He gave her two days to decide.

Isabelle had harbored feelings for Raiden for years, yet she had never imagined he would one day propose marriage.

Caught between shock and affection, Isabelle mulled it over for two days before accepting.

On the third day, they were legally married.

It was a decision that seemed impulsive yet felt right.

However, Isabelle did not foresee that both the child and their marriage would last past three years.

It began quickly and ended just as abruptly.

These two years had seemed like a mere illusion.

Surrounded by once-familiar objects in her home, Isabelle felt an unsettling emptiness.

She could not shake the memory of that night, the way he had caught her as she stumbled over her shoe, the intensity of his gaze lingering in her mind.

She remembered every detail‚Äîthe depth and stir in his dark eyes that had once made her heart skip.

She had believed it was love.

She imagined that, like her, he had held her in his heart over the years, igniting that moment of connection.

However, the truth was more sobering‚Äîhe had simply been drunk.

That realization left a quiet ache in her heart.

Isabelle knew that unless she spoke up, Raiden would never initiate a divorce. He would continue to share a placid, unremarkable life with her.

Yet this was not the marriage she envisioned.

She did not need a rich husband, but she longed for one who was present, warm, and shared a simple, joyful life with her.

Thus, she sought a divorce, and Raiden acquiesced more easily than she anticipated.

Perhaps he, too, felt a sense of relief, Isabelle mused.

As she surveyed the small space once brimming with her hopes, discomfort mingled with a newfound sense of liberation.

Finally, she picked up her phone and dialed the real estate agent who had facilitated her home purchase. ""Hello, I'd like to put my Hillview Bay house on the market. Could you assist me with that?""",1,1754770618.0,Novelnews,2,1.0,False
