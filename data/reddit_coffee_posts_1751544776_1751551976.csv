1lqqlj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/medschoolora/comments/1lqqlj1/weekly_step_prep_with_ora_2/,👀 Weekly Step Prep with Ora #2 🤔,"A 32-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of persistent restlessness and difficulty sleeping for the past eight months. He describes feeling constantly on edge and unable to relax, with his mind frequently racing about work and personal responsibilities. Despite making efforts to unwind, he finds it difficult to control these worries, which interfere with his concentration during the day. He acknowledges increased irritability, noting that minor issues now lead to significant frustration. Though he feels fatigued, he struggles to fall asleep and often wakes up feeling unrefreshed. He denies chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath. His medical history is notable only for seasonal allergies, managed with loratadine as needed. He works as an accountant and was recently promoted, resulting in a higher workload. He consumes four cups of coffee daily but denies tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. His father has a history of an anxiety disorder. On examination, he appears tense and frequently shifts in his seat. Muscle tenderness is noted in his neck and shoulders. Vital signs and laboratory studies, including thyroid function tests, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel, are within normal limits.

**Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient's condition?**

A. Mindfulness meditation  
B. Cognitive behavioral therapy  
C. Benzodiazepine use  
D. Psychoanalytic therapy  
E. Buspirone treatment  
F. Exposure therapy  
G. Progressive muscle relaxation  
H. Supportive psychotherapy

**Answer:** >!B. Cognitive behavioral therapy!<

Explanation: This patient exhibits symptoms consistent with [generalized anxiety disorder](https://app.oraai.com/library/8440b7ec-48b1-4084-8166-d27b8a6b7cbf) (GAD), including excessive anxiety and worry occurring for more than six months about various aspects of his life. His symptoms—restlessness, difficulty concentrating, muscle tension, irritability, sleep disturbances, and fatigue—are interfering with his daily functioning. Normal laboratory results rule out medical conditions like [hyperthyroidism](https://app.oraai.com/library/8140f9a2-5e2a-4ef4-bcd0-3ba31fbb4e78) that can mimic anxiety symptoms.

**Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)** is the most appropriate initial therapy for GAD. CBT is a first-line treatment that focuses on identifying and challenging maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors contributing to anxiety. It teaches coping skills, cognitive restructuring, and relaxation techniques to manage symptoms effectively. CBT has been shown to significantly reduce anxiety symptoms and improve quality of life in patients with GAD. It can be used alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy depending on symptom severity and patient preference.",1,1751551889.0,medschoolora,0,1.0,False

My picks (all from the food court at Hilton Suites, 3rd floor Makkah):

Fajita Corner's Falafel — 10 SAR. Used to visit this place often. Tell them ""extra shatta"" (sauce), ""harraq"" (spicy), and ""mukhallal"" (pickles) + zyada.

They load it up well. Far better than the average falafel shops around.

Broast from Tazaj — 25–30 SAR. The broast here beats the other options in the area because Al Baik doesn’t serve broast near the Haram.

O Jeen’s Spicy Faham and Chicken Curry — 15–30 SAR. Closest thing to Indian flavors. Tasty and worth the price.

Chicken nuggets at Al Baik — 15 SAR. Try going early or late at night to avoid the crowd. Had mixed experiences but overall a solid choice.

Cheesecake at one of the cafés (forgot the name) — 10 SAR. Pretty good for the price.

Camel Step (coffee of the day, cappuccino) — 10–17 SAR. This one’s on the ground floor. Lovely people, seem very passionate about their coffee. Probably the best coffee in the area.",1,1751551856.0,Umrah,0,1.0,False

1lqqjlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lqqjlt/trapped_between_the_betas_lies_and_the_alphas/,"Trapped Between the Beta's Lies and the Alpha's Truth
By Raine Harper","Summer Watson, an Omega in the Burke Pack, is trapped in a web of manipulation after a tragic fire claims her parents and leaves her sister, Alayna, severely injured. Desperate to cover the mounting medical bills, Summer becomes indebted to Kannon Burke, the pack’s cunning Beta, who saves her from a predatory relative only to use her as a pawn in his power struggle. Kannon pressures her to seduce his uncle, Asaiah, the pack’s Alpha, to secure his own rise to dominance. But as Kannon’s demands grow darker and his control tightens, Summer begins to question his true motives. When Kannon’s cold gaze pierces through her facade, she realizes the stakes are higher than she imagined. Will Summer survive the game, or will she become another casualty in Kannon’s ruthless quest for power?

# Chapter 1 - The Cold Embrace of Duty

After deciding I no longer wanted to be a pawn, his eyes turned cold.

Because of a fire, I lost my parents, and my sister, Alayna, an Omega like me in the Burke Pack, was severely injured and hospitalized.

Facing the high medical bills, I borrowed money everywhere.

When I was almost forced into an older wolf’s bed by a scheming relative, Kannon Burke, the Beta of the Burke Pack, saved me.

I became his pawn.

Later, he pressured me to seduce his uncle, Asaiah Burke, the Alpha of the Burke Pack.

For Alayna to receive the best treatment, I reluctantly agreed.

But one day, Kannon looked at me with cold eyes and said,

""Summer, come back to me, okay?""

==============================

""I’ve already transferred the medical fees for your sister to the hospital’s account today.""

Kannon loosened his shirt cuffs and slumped onto the couch, his muscular frame dominating the space.

I placed a glass of warm water on the coffee table in front of him, careful to keep my posture submissive.

""Thank you, Beta Kannon,"" I murmured.

He opened his eyes to look at me, those seemingly affectionate eyes behind gold-rimmed glasses appearing cold and detached.

He reached out and grabbed my wrist, pulling me into his arms with a strength that reminded me of his rank.

I stumbled and fell into Kannon’s embrace, his scent of pine and dominance overwhelming me.

His hand wandered restlessly over my thigh, and he buried his face in the crook of my neck, inhaling deeply.

Sometimes I thought Kannon was a bit twisted.

Although I was his pawn, the number of times we actually slept together could be counted on one hand.

I once wondered if Kannon wasn’t very capable, so he wasn’t particularly interested in ""desire.""

But the few times we did, he left me unable to get out of bed, and it felt more like he was venting his frustration.

I didn’t love Kannon, just as I knew he didn’t love me.

I needed him to pay for Alayna’s severe burns, but what he needed from me, I still didn’t understand.

I felt Kannon’s breathing grow heavier, and he asked me what perfume I was wearing today.

I thought about it; this afternoon, Kannon’s assistant, a Gamma in the pack, had brought over a bottle of perfume. I glanced at it—it was Chanel’s Coco Mademoiselle.

The Gamma said Kannon really liked this fragrance.

I had only sprayed it before Kannon arrived, after all, I still had to please him.

Just as I was about to answer, Kannon’s kiss landed on my collarbone.

I realized then that he didn’t actually care what perfume I was wearing; it was just a passing remark.

There was no love between Kannon and me, but I had to admit, in that regard, he was a perfect fit for me.

Kannon’s kisses trailed downward, and his hand slipped under the hem of my shirt.

I whimpered, which seemed to please him.

He picked me up, and I knew my ""duty"" for the day was about to begin.

Kannon was indeed a more than qualified benefactor.

When I was too exhausted to get out of bed, he would carry me to the bathroom and bathe me.

Then he’d place me on the freshly changed sheets of the soft bed.

Sometimes I thought that being a maid in Kannon’s house required first shedding all sense of shame.

I nestled into the soft bed, closing my eyes to rest, while Kannon held me in his arms, idly playing with my hair.

Just as I was drifting off, Kannon suddenly spoke, sounding satisfied.

""Summer, my uncle, Alpha Asaiah, has suddenly decided not to pursue a political career. My grandfather, the former Alpha, wants him to be the heir. The family business will be handed over to my uncle.""

I kept my eyes closed and murmured, ""Hmm.""

But Kannon wasn’t satisfied with my reaction. He turned me around, forcing me to look at him.

""I’ve heard my uncle is indifferent to beauty. But I don’t believe any wolf can truly resist temptation.""

I looked at Kannon, a bad feeling creeping into my heart.

# Chapter 2 - The Weight of a Wolf’s Grip

He reached out to stroke my cheek, his eyes filled with an unsettling intensity.

""Our Summer, such a beauty. I can’t believe my uncle, Alpha Asaiah, would remain indifferent to you.""

My heart sank as Beta Kannon continued speaking.

""I can’t let the family business fall into my uncle’s hands, Summer. Help me.""

The implication was clear—Beta Kannon wanted me to use my charm to ensure everyone in the pack saw the most prominent son of the Burke family as nothing but a debauched failure.

In the end, only he would benefit.

I stayed silent.

Whether this plan succeeded or failed, my fate wouldn’t be favorable.

Perhaps Beta Kannon sensed my hesitation. His flirtatious hazel eyes instantly turned cold, and the hand that had been caressing my cheek now gripped my neck.

He didn’t apply much pressure, but I broke into a cold sweat.

""Summer Watson, you know I’m not a patient wolf. What if I were to cut off your sister’s treatment…""

Before he could finish, I felt my blood run cold.

I realized then that going against Beta Kannon was like an Omega trying to challenge an Alpha.

I heard my own mechanical voice reply, ""I understand, Beta Kannon.""

He smiled again, but there was no warmth in those hazel eyes.

Beta Kannon left early. When I woke up, he was already gone.

He didn’t come here every day, but whenever he did, my nerves would be on edge, afraid of displeasing him in any way.

Today was my sister’s third skin graft surgery.

I got up, dressed neatly, and headed to the hospital.

She lay in the hospital bed, joking with the nurses. Suddenly, I felt that as long as she got better, I could do anything.

After what felt like an eternity, Alayna was wheeled out of the operating room. The pack’s healer told me the surgery was successful, and I finally let out a sigh of relief.

Three months ago, a massive fire broke out in our home. My parents died in the blaze, and Alayna was the only survivor, but she suffered extensive burns.

The healer said she needed multiple skin graft surgeries—a long and expensive process.

Watching her lie in the hospital bed, devoid of her usual energy, I swore I would do whatever it took to restore her health.

Meeting Beta Kannon was somewhat serendipitous. At the time, I was borrowing money from pack members, but one of them drugged me, intending to send me to the bed of a high-ranking Delta.

With the last bit of my willpower, I escaped and stumbled into Beta Kannon’s arms.

He dealt with those wolves, and I became his trophy.

He paid for Alayna’s treatment, and I became the Omega by his side, providing him with whatever emotional support he needed.

With just a word from Beta Kannon, everything I held dear could vanish from this world.

Beta Kannon promised that once his plan succeeded, he would give me a sum of money and send Alayna and me to a pack where no one knew us.

# Chapter 3 - The Sharpest Weapon in the Game

It was clear that Beta Kannon had no intention of letting his uncle, Alpha Asaiah, take over the family business.

He handed me a thick dossier on Alpha Asaiah, filled with meticulous details, even down to which foot he stepped out with first when leaving the pack house.

Beta Kannon said, ""Know your enemy, know yourself, and you’ll never lose.""

He pulled me close, tilted my chin up, and gazed at me with what seemed like an ""intense"" look.

""Summer, you’ll become my sharpest weapon.""

Beta Kannon spent three months shaping me into the perfect Omega Alpha Asaiah would be drawn to.

I had wondered how he knew exactly what kind of Omega Alpha Asaiah preferred.

Until I saw a photo of Alpha Asaiah with a Luna.

The Luna in the photo looked strikingly similar to me.

No wonder Beta Kannon saw me as his ultimate tool.

When I stood before Beta Kannon in a pale yellow Victorian-style dress, I saw the mix of pride and excitement on his face.

During those three months, I had thought about running away. But every time he showed me a video of Alayna, my resolve crumbled.

He walked up to me, fastened a pearl necklace around my neck, and nodded in satisfaction.

Today was Beta Kannon’s grandfather’s birthday celebration. Alpha Asaiah, the elusive youngest son of the Burke Pack, who was planning to transition from leading the pack’s warriors to focusing on pack politics, would also be there.

""Summer, you’ll be the most captivating presence at the party.""

Beta Kannon was pleased with his ""creation.""

I walked into the Burke mansion on his arm. Compared to his father, a Delta who only knew how to indulge in pleasure, Beta Kannon clearly held much higher standing in the pack.

Beta Kannon, holding a champagne glass, was surrounded by a crowd, exuding the aura of a future Alpha. It was no wonder his grandfather, the former Alpha, had personally taken over his upbringing, bypassing his father.

Just before the celebration began, Beta Kannon’s father arrived late.

Beta Kannon’s expression darkened when he saw his father, but when he noticed the young Luna on his father’s arm, a flicker of obsession and melancholy passed through his eyes.

I felt like I had stumbled upon Beta Kannon’s secret.

The Luna was radiant, and she looked only about ten years older than Beta Kannon.

When she brushed past me, I caught the familiar scent of her perfume, and I finally understood why Beta Kannon had asked me what perfume I was wearing that day.

I couldn’t help but shiver.

The Beta of the Burke Pack was infatuated with his stepmother, Luna Angelina. If this got out, it was hard to say who would be more ruined—Alpha Asaiah or Beta Kannon himself.

Beta Kannon didn’t want me to be labeled as his. To everyone, he introduced me as just a friend, someone he admired for my piano skills.

He said, ""Today is my grandfather’s birthday, and I wanted him to hear you play.""

Beta Kannon wasn’t wrong. Before my family’s tragedy, I had been a pianist in the pack, and I had just received an offer from an orchestra.

Beta Kannon wasn’t in a hurry to introduce me to Alpha Asaiah. Instead, he presented me to his grandfather, the former Alpha.

""Grandfather, this is Summer Watson, a pianist who just returned from abroad. Her music is truly exceptional. I’m sure you’ll love it.""

Yes, Beta Kannon had given me a new identity.

A recently returned, relatively unknown pianist.

# Chapter 4 - A Dance with the Alpha

Until I finished playing the piece and stood up, amidst the cheers and applause of the pack, I spotted Alpha Asaiah standing just outside the throng.

His gaze held a hint of nostalgia, as if he were seeing someone from his past through me.

I racked my brain but couldn’t recall ever having crossed paths with him before.

After a brief conversation with the former Alpha, Kannon’s grandfather, I grew bored and found myself holding a champagne glass, zoning out in a quiet corner.

“Not a fan of these kinds of events?”

I looked up to see Alpha Asaiah standing there. I had been wondering how to approach him, but he had beaten me to it.

I quickly masked my surprise and nodded.

“Then why did you come?”

Alpha Asaiah studied me with a probing gaze.

His intense stare made me uneasy. I couldn’t exactly tell him that Beta Kannon had brought me here to, well, catch his attention.

I smiled and replied,

“I’m friends with Beta Kannon. He mentioned it’s the former Alpha’s birthday today and wanted to give him a special gift. I’m just here to support him.”

It was a polished, diplomatic response—one of the many skills I had honed over the years.

Alpha Asaiah took a sip from his glass and nodded, though his eyes betrayed a lack of trust.

Not that it mattered. If Alpha Asaiah had fully trusted me after just a few words, he wouldn’t be the Alpha of the Burke Pack.

Despite his skepticism, Alpha Asaiah didn’t leave. He lingered by my side.

The party’s focus, apart from the former Alpha, was Alpha Asaiah, so the pack’s attention gradually shifted to the corner where we stood.

Feeling uncomfortable under their scrutiny, I awkwardly tried to excuse myself and slip away.

But Alpha Asaiah caught my wrist, set down his glass, and extended his hand with a smile.

“Miss Watson, may I have the honor of this dance?”

I hesitated, looking at his outstretched hand. Beta Kannon had given me a crash course in dancing, but I was still far from graceful.

“But… I’m not very good at it.”

Alpha Asaiah chuckled, took my hand, and gently pulled me into his arms.

I felt his breath warm against my ear as he whispered,

“Don’t worry, I’ll lead.”

Alpha Asaiah was the picture of a gentleman. Even though I kept stepping on his feet, he didn’t lose his temper. Instead, he softly reassured me.

Honestly, compared to Beta Kannon, who seemed harmless on the surface, Alpha Asaiah exuded the air of a true leader.

After that, Alpha Asaiah stayed close. Even as I retreated to the corner, he occasionally brought me snacks and small dishes.

When the birthday cake was wheeled out and the lights dimmed for the candle-blowing, someone suddenly grabbed my wrist and pulled me onto the balcony.

In the dim light, I saw it was Beta Kannon, his face pale with anger, his grip on my wrist tightening.

His voice was low and strained as he hissed,

“Summer Watson, stay away from Alpha Asaiah.”

# Chapter 5 - The Game of Seduction and Deception

I was completely baffled by Beta Kannon's words. It was him who had asked me to ""seduce"" Alpha Asaiah, and now he was telling me to stay away from him.I broke free from his grip and looked at him with a hint of amusement.

1lqqgfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1lqqgfh/manifesting_is_easy/,Manifesting is easy,"This sub has become a pit full of people who over complicate the entire process, and the reason for this is the oversaturated youtube videos and tiktoks that teach a “new technique” every other day. People can’t manifest because they put their faith into a new method everyday. “Oh this didn’t work as quick as I wanted so I’m going to try something new”. You’ll be stuck in a rut and begin to hate manifesting if you do down that route. The law of assumption, law of attraction, manifesting - whatever you call it, it’s the same thing and uses the same ideology. And most importantly it’s always happening - you cannot switch off from manifesting. 

There are plenty people I see who believe in the 3D/4D nonsense, do scripting, do robotic affirmations, make vision boards, even write letters to themselves, and yet they still don’t have their manifestation. I see people take longer than 3 months to manifest an SP. They over complicate the entire process. 

MANIFESTATION IS INSTANT. 

The moment you make an assumption, it happens. 
It doesn’t matter if doubts come, you need to have full conviction. You don’t need to manifest waking up in the morning, you don’t need to manifest your furniture in your house being there when you wake up, you don’t manifest the people in your life being there every day. The moment you attach yourself to a manifestation, you detach from the possibility of having it. If you had your SP, you wouldn’t be doing affirmations or scripting, or being like a looney person and saying “okay I have my SP in the 4D but in the 3D they’re getting it on with the 3P but that’s fine because I’m manifesting and in a few months they’ll be mine”. It doesn’t make sense. You either have your desire in this world or you don’t have it at all, and the only person who has that decision to make is you. You aren’t God, but God has given you the ability to manifest things. I see lots of people claiming they’re gods and yet they struggle to manifest, you need to destroy that ego because that is the ultimate limiting belief. 

The big issue:

The only issue you’ll ever deal with in manifesting is your own limiting beliefs. That’s it. If you believe being obese runs in your family so you can’t lose weight, guess what? You’re going to identify with that belief. If you believe a medical condition runs in your family, you’re going to identify with that belief. And the phony manifestation methods I mentioned above like believing you have your desire in the 4D and not the 3D, scripting, robotic affirmations - are all your own limiting beliefs. “If I just write my desire out 1000 times I’ll get it”. “If I just affirm everyday I’ll get my desire”. Nobody ever said you have to do a long process to get your desire, you created that own assumption in your mind and yet once you do all those methods, you still don’t get your desire. The law of assumption doesn’t say “do this and do that so you’ll get what you want”. It only says make an assumption, and have full conviction. That’s it. 

“You are in Barbados” - Neville Goddard. This quote is everything you’ll ever need in manifesting. You don’t need the money hungry YouTubers who make you watch every video they post and you still left confused. You don’t need to watch endless tiktoks. You manifest every single day effortlessly and you don’t think about it because you don’t have limiting beliefs when it comes to those things. This is why people always suggest starting off with manifesting a coffee, there’s no emotion in it. 

My advice to anyone who is struggling is to focus on your own happiness. Get rid of your limiting beliefs even if that means getting rid of anything or anyone negative in your life. Life is meant to be enjoyed, you have the ability to manifest so don’t over complicate this gift. Just make the assumption and stick to it. ",2,1751551525.0,lawofassumption,0,1.0,False

1lqqfh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lqqfh2/why_choose_the_chulux_kompatto_espresso_machine/,Why Choose the CHULUX Kompatto Espresso Machine for Perfect Coffee?,"**A Daily Delight in Coffee Brewing**

Using the CHULUX Kompatto JH-C5010 has been an everyday adventure in my kitchen. With its sleek silver finish and compact design, it immediately caught my eye. At just 11.8"" deep, 5.6"" wide, and 12.4"" high, this espresso machine doesn’t hog valuable counter space, making it ideal for anyone with a small kitchen, dorm room, or apartment.

What really makes it stand out is its 20-bar precision pressure pump with a pre-soak function—something I found elevates the brewing process. The machine pre-moistens the coffee powder with low pressure before ramping up to high-pressure extraction. This results in rich, aromatic coffee with just the right balance and a surprisingly low acidity level. After tasting that first cup, I was immediately smitten with the depth of flavor.  

**Ease of Use and Ideal Design**

The operation is semi-automatic, which makes the espresso-making process straightforward but still engaging enough to feel like a barista in training. The metallic exterior also gives off a modern vibe while being easy to clean. Plus, all the essentials are included: a single and double cup filter, a portafilter, a milk frother for rich microfoam, and even a handy scoop and tamper. I particularly appreciate how the drip tray and 40oz water tank are removable, simplifying the cleaning process, especially after making multiple drinks during holiday gatherings with friends.

[Check CHULUX Kompatto JH-C5010 price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b0cpj2xtxf/)

**Performance That Shines Through**

The 1350W instant heating system made a noticeable difference during use. It takes just 30 seconds to preheat, which is perfect for my mornings when I'm rushing to get ready for work. Preparing a cup of espresso only takes about 20-30 seconds, and its built-in PID precise temperature control ensures the water stays between 170-185°F. That level of precision brewing is typically reserved for higher-end machines, but here it's packaged in such an affordable and space-saving unit.

The top plate even doubles as a warming tray for cups, which adds a small but thoughtful touch to the overall experience. Whether you’re brewing a single shot or a double, the machine doesn’t falter under regular use, and you can count on consistency.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact design that suits small spaces.
- 20-bar pressure pump for rich, low-acidity coffee.
- Easy-to-clean removable components (drip tray, water tank).
- Built-in PID precise temperature control for brewing consistency.
- Quick 30-second preheating and speedy preparation times.
- Multifunctionality with steam wand for making lattes, cappuccinos, and more.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Milk frother lacks some oomph for larger milk quantities.
- Power button operation isn't very intuitive for first-time users.
- Can get slightly noisy, especially during milk steaming. 

**Other Options in the Espresso Market**

When I compare it with other espresso makers like the De'Longhi EC155 or the Breville Bambino Plus, a few differences stood out. Both competitors offer solid milk frothing capabilities, but the Bambino Plus stands out for its automatic frothing precision. However, it’s significantly pricier and takes up a tad more space on the counter than the CHULUX Kompatto JH-C5010.

Meanwhile, the De'Longhi EC155 matches the Kompatto in affordability but falls short in delivering that rich, balanced espresso taste due to its lower pressure pump. CHULUX’s standout 20-bar pressure pump gives it a clear edge on flavor and aroma, especially when comparing shot-for-shot.

**Affordable Quality**

What struck me the most is its value for money. For a machine this compact, with so many features, it delivers a performance I wasn’t expecting at its price point. Many budget espresso machines tend to skimp on either build quality, consistency, or flavor precision, but this one punches above its weight on all counts. I use it not just for personal cups but also for entertaining friends during cozy gatherings at home. Considering that this espresso maker has a steam wand for lattes, a quick extraction process, and easy maintenance, I’d say it’s a smart investment for any coffee enthusiast looking to upgrade their mornings without breaking the bank.

I already have one of my dream bikes (2016 road king). I was able to get that because I was willing to pay $10k because it seemed like a small amount for a grown adult with a full time job and 30 years till retirement. 

Another one of my dream bikes is a BMW R 1300 GSA. Let’s just say it would come out to $30k. Because of this, I may never own this dream bike. That actually makes me sad when I think of it that way. Like if I live a long age, I can imagine myself on my death thinking wow, I deprived myself of a cool bike when I loved riding so much.

Then I think man, there’s also a lot of people out there who can buy a $20-30k bike every couple of months. 

I mean like if someone has 2 million dollars saved, buying a few brand new motorcycles would be like having hundreds of dollars in your wallet and not worry about splurging on coffee.

Like motorcycles seem unattainable but they’re also cheap depending on the person.

I also know of people who make 500k a year and still refuse to buy a new fancy bike but I’m not like that.

I think I’m seeing too many rich people on social media and it feels so abnormal and sad being average and just wondering how you all think about life and money and motorcycles to put some sense into me?

I opened my eyes. I was on the balcony, elbow on the table, fingers against my forehead. Carmen – sat on the other chair next to me – yawned, covering her mouth with the back of her hand. She turned to look at me and I got up before she could say a word, grabbed her hand and dragged her inside.

“What is the matter with you?” she admonished me, but I looked at her with a finger to my lips and walked her through the lounge. When we were between the kitchen and the front door, I stopped.

“I can reset time,” I said, pointing at the gem in my head. “That’s what this does. When you were on the balcony just now, you were going to tell me that you could have sworn it was nighttime. It was. I don’t know exactly how it works but it puts us back to that moment on the balcony after I’d explained to you about the girl, the head, the gem. But time is still moving forwards. It was 3 am when we were out there.

“Now it’s,” I quickly grabbed my phone from my pocket before putting it back, “nine thirty-one. This is the fourth time I’m living through this. The System has initialised and put a bounty on my head and in about four minutes, Darren will be at the door coming to claim it.

“I need you to trust me. Go to the bedroom, pack our gym bags with clothes for both of us. Get dressed and ready within ten minutes. Grab any cash you can and wake the girl up. We need to go. You can check the news on your phone. It will show you I’m not playing here.”

I could see in her face that she had so many questions, but she did as I asked, grabbing her phone from the coffee table in the lounge and headed to the bedroom. I went into the kitchen and had a look for the biggest knives I could find. I grabbed a couple – maybe five or six inches long – stuffed them into the waistband of my jeans, and then headed back to the balcony. I approached at an angle to see if Darren was there without him being able to see me.

When I couldn’t see him, I ventured out to the balcony to the side closest to his. The barrier came up to around the middle of my torso, just below the chest and there was a two metre gap between our balconies. I grabbed one of the chairs and placed it in the corner and used it to lift myself onto the barrier, its top wide enough for me to get purchase. I clung to the wall and didn’t look down, but I was confident I could get across.

I stretched a leg across, facing the wall and planting my left hand against the wall on Darren’s side. I made it, rested my foot on their barrier and as I went to move my other leg across, I slipped. I tried my best to grab onto the barriers, either of them; tried to get some purchase somewhere but I hit my side against my balcony, knocked my head against Darren’s and fell through the gap. I hit the balconies below and then I was free-falling, hands and legs flailing at the air, my body wracked in pain. I closed my eyes, waiting for the inevitable.

I crashed into the ground with a force that I couldn’t even process.

 

\*\*\*

 

My eyes opened. Alrighty then. Take five.

I was on the balcony. Carmen was not. She was outside my sphere of influence where I’d died. So would Darren and Michelle have been. I checked the time. 9.33 am. I didn’t have more than a minute or two. I ran to the kitchen, grabbed the knives and a wad of tissue paper and back out onto the balcony.

I put the chair in the corner again, and quickly used the paper to wipe down the barrier. At some point during the night, it had rained a little, small droplets still spattered around. I attempted the move again. On the chair, on the barrier, face and body clinging to the wall as I stretched across. I took my time a little. Braced myself. Then I pushed off of my right foot, fingers doing their best to dig into the brick as I managed to get across with all the grace of a bear practicing ballet, my foot landing softly on Darren’s barrier.

I waited a moment, listening out for whether they might have heard me or not. I could hear the sound of their TV playing a news channel. Maybe all the channels were like that now. It was big enough news to be an emergency broadcast.

“…news is filtering in that police and security services are closing in on River Clarke’s location…”

Well, that’s just great. I’d wasted too much time on these two twats. I got down quietly, ducked to the floor, and took a little peek through the two-pane glass patio doors. The side furthest from me was open. Their flat had the same layout as ours but with the dining room and lounge switched around. I could see the TV and as I nudged my head forward, keeping low to the ground, I could see the armrest of the sofa, a metre or so from me. Rolls of fat that resembled an arm rested on the top of it.

I could hear Darren talking now. “We need to get him before the police or anyone else.”

“I’ll be right behind you,” Michelle said.

I watched as she struggled to get up from the sofa. Every time previous, she hadn’t been a couple of minutes behind Darren because it was pre-planned like that. It was because that’s how long it had taken for her to physically get there. Darren was the main threat right now, but to get to him, I needed to get past her first. It was like being stuck behind an eighteen-wheeler in the fast lane.

I shuffled quietly to the open pane, tucked my head around the corner and watched as the pizza-lover waddled towards the opening to the hallway. Darren was already gone but I had a plan and if there was one thing I could say about my plans, it was that my plans always worked…sometimes.

And I could reset for when they didn’t.

As Michelle cleared the entrance, I got up and walked carefully through their through-lounge, careful to not make a sound. I sidled up to the entrance, listening out for them, but I couldn’t hear them at all. I took a risk, popped my head around and looked down the hallway. What was the guestroom in my flat looked to be Darren’s bedroom here. I could see him grabbing something from under the bed. The machete. With it in hand, he turned and I quickly tucked my head back.

“Mum, I’m going,” I heard him say as his voice got closer.

“I’m coming,” Michelle shouted back.

I counted seconds in my head, and when I was sure he had got to the door, I made my move, grabbing one of the knives at my waist in my right hand. He had his hand on the handle of the door but turned his head when he felt my presence. He barely had the time to be surprised.

I’d watched enough true crime in my life to know that what they taught you in the movies about stabbings and strangling’s was a load of bullshit. Both were very slow ways to kill people, unless you knew what you were doing.

I didn’t know what I was doing.

I did know that the best thing was to use my element of surprise and go feral on the prick.

I slammed my blade into Darren’s neck as hard as I could, but he lashed out with the machete. I caught the blow with my left hand, which was as stupid as it sounds, but it was either that or let the blow hit my head. As it was, the machete still grazed my scalp and I had a nasty gash to my hand, but it didn’t matter anyway. Darren dropped the machete, hands clasping his throat. As he spluttered and gasped for air, I grabbed the machete and did like I had done before. Hacked as hard and as fast as I could. I wasn’t trained for this. I wasn’t prepared for this. I just knew I had to do what was necessary to keep myself and Carmen safe.

After I was done with Darren, I moved towards the bedrooms, machete in hand. I didn’t bother looking back at him. I didn’t think I could. To see what I had done might’ve frozen me in my tracks. I was no killer. Isn’t that how we worked? Turn a blind eye to the things we didn’t want to see. If we didn’t see it, it didn’t happen. That’s what I needed to do to move forward.

Michelle’s bedroom was the one opposite the bathroom. I took a peek, saw her putting ammo into the shotgun. I’d been in my fair share of scraps in my younger days and the truth was – Michelle was a big woman and not one I could easily take on. Especially not when she had that shotgun. I backtracked to where Darren’s body was, still careful not to look at him. I quietly opened the front door a tad, and then ducked into their kitchen, and waited for Michelle to stumble across his body. My hand was bleeding badly but the adrenaline pumping through my body stopped me from feeling the pain as I should.

I kept my eyes on the door – Darren’s body was at the foot of it. Michelle came along a few moments later. She dropped to the floor when she saw him and knelt over him. She had her back to me, the shotgun on the floor next to her. Maybe fate was being kind to me for the four times I’d already died.

I hacked down with the machete right into the back of her scalp as she knelt over her child. She wailed loudly and tried to turn, grasping for the gun but I got there first. Her eyes widened as she saw me.

“Sorry,” I said as I pulled the trigger and looked away. It only helped me to not see her head, but bits of flesh and blood and brain splattered across the carpets and the walls. I gagged but held it in.

Still, no time to rest. No time to consider what I had done. I jumped over their bodies to check outside the door but there was no-one outside. I shut the front door and made my way to their bathroom. It was as dirty as I would expect of these two but I put the shotgun on the floor, put the other knife from my waist on the edge of the bath and turned the taps of the washbasin on. The adrenaline was receding from my system and the pain of the gash had me wincing. There was blood on my hands. Looking in the mirror, there was blood just above the gem, trickling down from the gash in my head. The bags under my eyes seemed darker, my skin haggard and gaunt, a little wrinkled in places, and a little more chubby in the cheeks. I looked like I’d aged twenty odd years. This morning was taking its toll on me.

I kept my left hand under the tap and every so often used water to clean my head too. With my free hand, I opened their cabinet and lo and behold, they had everything I needed. Gauze, bandaging, ethanol. I grabbed a towel, put it to the gash and let it soak up the blood and water, before using the ethanol to disinfect the wound, wincing through gritted teeth as I did. Quickly, roughly, I applied a wad of the gauze, then wrapped the bandage around it to keep it in place. Blood was seeping through immediately but it would do for now.

I took a seat on the edge of their bath, put my head in my hands as I stared at their bathroom floor, my muscles aching a little, my knees a little wobbly. I let the moment sink in. I had just become a murderer. Never mind that I knew they would kill Carmen to get me. I had murdered them in cold blood.

I must have been sitting there for a minute or two when I gave myself a slap around the face. I needed to snap out of it. No time to wallow in self-pity or regret. And truthfully, I didn’t regret killing them. The world’s better off without certain people in it. Subjective judgment or not, I believed it. And I’d lived it. Those two might have only wanted the money, but they had no hesitation to kill when they thought it necessary. I had only acted in kind.

And I would do it again.",1,1751551251.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

POWERS

Induced madness: Sam can induce small periods of madness up to a certain level and time period. This sometimes happens when Sam’s emotions get out of control, or he can also make it happen with a huge amount of concentration. Madness will often last from 5–100 mins.  
Side effects: It’s very tiring and often makes Sam fall asleep if he has done it more than once in one day.

Grape growing: Sam can will grapes/grapevines to grow anywhere and anytime. They don’t need soil or anything either! (Could be used to strangle someone.)

Water into wine: Sam can turn any liquid (water, juice, Coke, coffee, petrol, poison, etc.) into wine. (It’s easy with stuff like water, juice, Coke, or coffee, but stuff like petrol is hard, and poison is extremely hard.)

STORY:

I was born in the big city of Hamburg, in Germany. I lived there for several years like a normal, happy kid. But when I was 4, the first supernatural thing happened. One day, when I was about 4 years old, I was walking in the shops with my mum, and I was sure I saw a human-shaped being or something like a ghost walk straight through a wall! I quickly asked my mom if she saw anything, but she denied it and said I imagined it. But after that, we quickly went home without finishing our shopping.

When I was 5, another event like this happened. And when I was 6, I was sure I saw a guy with wings standing outside our door. When I called my mom down, he was gone…

All was fine until I turned 13. As a birthday present, my parents decided to take me on a 3-week trip to the USA! I was really excited! We had already bought the tickets and booked the hotel. About 4 hours into the flight, we got some turbulence. About 5 hours in, it really started to shake. And at about 6 hours in, the right wing blew—broke off! It was complete chaos. People and luggage falling around and getting sucked out into a hole in the wall, bits of stuff flying around!

As we headed at full speed toward the ground, I was sure I saw the exact same man with wings I had seen 7 years ago. But then he was gone… and I blacked out.

I woke up later with a throbbing head, with a bunch of nurses and doctors clustered around me. They told me I was the only one who survived and that my parents had died. My mind went blind with grief, and I can’t really remember what I did. I just sat around for a few days, not believing what I had heard.

Finally, it hit me—my parents, the best people in the world, the only ones who ever believed in me—were dead. Two weeks after the plane crash, a mysterious guy wearing a hat came to the hospital and showed the nurses some papers. They told me to pack my stuff and go with him. I had never seen him in my life, but I didn’t really care about much now since my parents were gone.

He took me to where it took me a couple of minutes to decipher the text: Delphi Strawberry Service. I had no idea what Delphi Strawberry Service was, but neither did I care. The man told me to get into the car. We drove for about 40 minutes until we arrived on top of a hill. I was thinking, why the hell would he bring me here, when a stronger-than-normal gust of wind blew his hat off. He had horns!

“Are you a goat man?!”

Indignantly, he replied, “Dude, watch your tone. I’m a satyr, not a goat man. I’m a S-A-T-Y-R.”

“A what?”

“Dude, haven’t you ever read Greek mythology?”

“Of course I have, but it’s not real! It’s just myth people made up to explain certain stuff like plants, water, the sky, etc.”

Just then, the sky rumbled. Was it a coincidence, or something else? The goat dude led me to the top of the hill. I gasped in awe as I saw the huge Greek campus spread out below me. It was amazing!

“How doesn’t anyone know of it?”

“It’s the mist.”

“I don’t see any mist. It’s perfectly sunny down there, which is weird because it’s starting to storm here.”

And indeed it was. The goat dude led me past a pine tree with something gold in it. Was it a Golden Fleece? Was it the Golden Fleece?! Just when I was about to ask, I noticed a dragon sitting right next to the tree. I jumped back in panic!

“Dude, why didn’t you warn me you have a dragon?!”

“Ohhhh, him? He is peaceful unless you try and steal the fleece. Oh, and by the way, I haven’t introduced myself. I’m Max. How about you?”

I replied, “I’m Sam.”

Max showed me around camp. It was awesome! An entire weapon house? Cool! Different houses for different sons/daughters of the gods? Super cool! Unlimited food at dinner? Extra super cool!

After Max showed me around camp, he told me I would need to choose a weapon because we were gonna have Capture the Flag tomorrow!

“A real weapon? But couldn’t someone get hurt or even die?”

“Don’t worry, no one has died in the past 3 months,” replied Max.

“That’s, uhhh, reassuring?”

“Don’t worry, kiddo. Your team captain will probably put you in some part of the forest that’s not very useful, so no one will come after you.”

After this encouraging talk, we heard the dinner bell ring. Dinner time! I was amazed by the food just appearing there! It was awesome! I got some grape juice, pizza, a burger, some sushi, grilled sandwiches, steak, and chocolate cake. The food was the best I had ever tried!

After that, it was campfire singing. Usually, I hate singing, but this time it was really fun! On the very last song (“My Little Pegasus”), as I was drinking some grape juice, a sign appeared above my head! A grapevine.

“It seems you’re a child of Dionysus. No wonder he wasn’t here today. He never is when one of his children gets claimed.”

“Wait, what?! My, uhhh… you’re saying my dad is the god of alcohol? But I can’t drink wine at camp?! And what? He works here?”

“Yes, he’s the camp’s activity director.”

After that, I went to bed with the rest of my cabin. It took me a longggg time to fall asleep, as I was still thinking about the events of the entire day. So much had happened in the last month. Maybe I could live a new life here? I hoped so, and with a troubled mind, I fell asleep.

As of now, I have been at camp for 2 weeks and 3 days.

I was on the balcony, elbow on the table, fingers against my forehead. Carmen – sat on the other chair next to me – yawned, covering her mouth with the back of her hand. She turned to look at me, a frown on her face, as if she’d lost something and was trying to trace back her steps.

“I swear it was nighttime,” she said.

It had been when we were here last, when the System initialising message came on. I’d just finished explaining to her about the woman in the guestroom and the decapitated head.

“Yo, Carmen,” a voice called out from the balcony next to ours. Darren was leaning against the barrier on his side. He was naked, save for a pair of boxers, a slight paunch hanging out, at odds with his gangly frame.

Carmen rolled her eyes, stood and shuffled inside. She was in the same clothes as before, having the same response. As she walked in, she pointed at her forehead with that look telling me to be careful.

“What’s that on your head?” Darren asked.

With the light outside, he could clearly see the gem, but he didn’t know what it was. Not yet. I was still processing what was happening but somehow, time had gone back six hours. And yet it hadn’t. It was daytime.

“Just a bit of a bruise,” I lied, covering my forehead. “I’ll talk to you in a bit, mate. Havin’ a moment with the missus.”

The nasty prick gave me a gap-toothed smile. “I bet.”

I’d barely stepped inside when the doorbell rang. I stopped in my tracks. It clearly wasn’t Darren this time. Someone else hunting the bounty? Carmen and I kept ourselves to ourselves in the main. We were only superficially polite to others in the building. A ‘Hi, how’s you?’ here. A ‘Gosh, this weather’ there. We were excellent examples of the typical Londoner. It was too soon for anyone, other than Darren to know I lived here.

Carmen was sat cross-legged on the sofa, with the TV on and looked over at me with concern in her eyes. As I walked through the dining room and past the sofa to the door, I saw what she was watching. The same newscast from earlier, with the long notification scrolling on the right-hand side, with the bounty offer on my head. The time in the corner of the screen showed 9:14 am. Ten minutes had passed since the System notification, but I understood the concern that Carmen showed. This was the first she was learning of it. It seemed she didn’t recall what had happened.

I got to the front door and looked through the peephole. An elderly black man with a wispy white beard was stood there. I didn’t recognise him.

“Can I help you?” I said, without opening the door.

“Hi. I live a couple of doors down. I was just checking that everything is alright?”

“Everything’s fine. Why d’you ask?”

“We heard a commotion and some loud bangs. You sure everything’s okay?”

A commotion and loud bangs. He was referring to Darren and Michelle. This was another one of those times where my brain was working overtime, trying to fill in the blanks and coming up empty. Everything that had happened earlier had happened. The fight with Darren. The gunshots. Darren sitting on me and plunging that machete into my side over and over. I could remember the sensation, feel the squelch of the blade cutting through my flesh.

And then it hit me.

I’d died.

I’d died and come back.

“Everything’s fine,” I said to the man. “Thanks for checking in.”

“And the young girl you got there? Your girlfriend?”

“What about her?”

“Is she good?”

“Yes, she’s good.”

“Mind if I speak to her? Just to make sure.”

I looked through the peephole again. He didn’t seem to mean any harm. Didn’t seem to have any weapons on him. He was lean but old and I didn’t see him being a threat. It was quite sweet really. He didn’t know jack about us but he knew Carmen lived here, heard noises that were out of the ordinary and came to check on her. Make sure she was alright. He’s the kind of neighbour you’d want looking out for your daughter.

I opened the door with my other hand covering the gem, and invited him in to check, nodding at the lounge. He popped his head in and looked around the door at Carmen.

“You okay, miss?” he asked.

“I’m…” she looked at me with a questioning look, “…fine.” The hesitation didn’t help. Nor did looking at me.

“Satisfied?” I asked the old man, trying to get him out the door. He looked at me with a casual nod and shuffled back outside.

“By the way, which flat did you say you were?”

“Two doors down. The corner unit. Name’s Delroy.”

I nodded at him. No way I was giving my name out to anyone. I’d need to think of a new identity. I shut the door and went and sat by Carmen.

“What was that about?” Carmen asked.

“He thought I was beating you. I told him only with your permission.”

She gave me a gentle punch to the shoulder. I concentrated on the news.

“…being offered for any information regarding the whereabouts of River Clarke. If you have any information, you are encouraged to call the police hotline…”

The doorbell rang again.

It had been less than a minute since I sat down. With a huff, I got back up and opened the front door without checking. “What now?” I said, expecting to see Delroy. It was Darren instead, machete hidden behind his back. He stepped inside before I could shut the door on him.

“Easier than I thought it’d be,” the prick said. I had no weapon this time. No way to keep my distance from him. But the hallway was tight. I acted without thinking, throwing a punch right at his temple. I caught him off-guard but he didn’t drop like I’d hoped, instead throwing his arms out to hold me. We got into a scrap, grabbing hold of each other, pushing each other against the walls. The cold metal of his blade smacked against the back of my head. We remained in a scuffle until I pushed him past the door and into the lounge. We went over the sofa together, Carmen screaming as she ran towards the dining table.

We both went over like before, my back slamming into the coffee table, my feet smacking against the TV. I saw the machete come down at me again but with no bat, all I could do was put my hands out and grab hold of his wrist. Again, his strength was surprising but like last time, after moments of straining against each other, I gained the upper hand, and like last time, the sound of breaking glass rang out.

The tension I had been straining against disappeared as Darren lashed out with the blade behind him and I heard Carmen howl. I knew what was going to happen next as I flipped over and looked back, seeing the same scene. Carmen with a bloodied arm, trapped against the dining table, Darren marching towards her. Michelle would be here any moment. I needed to act. Fast. I jumped up, and before Darren got the chance to grab Carmen by the throat like last time, I tackled him from the side, pinning him against the wall and grabbing his wrist, twisting it to make him drop the weapon. I used him as cover, keeping his arm and that side of his body between me and the lounge door.

The boom sounded out moments later. The sledgehammer on corrugated steel. I didn’t feel like I’d been hit by it this time, but I heard Michelle.

“Let him go, or you’ll end up like your girlfriend.”

I looked up at the pizza-loving woman and then to my left, I noticed Carmen. On the floor. Unmoving. She was on her front with the back of her t-shirt stained with splodges of red. Blood.

I let Darren go and dropped to my knees beside Carmen, turning her over and seeing the mess that was her torso, where the pellets had ripped into her soft skin. Her eyes were open. Glazed. Staring at nothing. I cradled her head in my hands, stroked her black hair back. Small water drops sprinkled on her face. Not water drops. Tears. My tears. I didn’t cry out loud. Didn’t scream. I wouldn’t give them the satisfaction. The tears came unbidden, otherwise I wouldn’t have even let them see that.

“Thanks mum,” Darren said. He grabbed me by the arm, dragged me away from Carmen. I let him.

“You gonna behave?” Darren asked me. I nodded as I looked at him and then at his equally ugly mother, who had the shotgun trained on me.

“Even if you give me up, how are you going to explain this to the police?” I asked.

“We’ll think of something,” he replied.

I looked at Carmen. She seemed to be looking at me. Almost accusing me.

“System,” Darren said and then looked to be reading something in front of him. The invisible blue screen.

I had a feeling I could fix this. The gem could fix this. It fixed me. I didn’t know exactly how it worked, but last time, everyone in this room reset. Delroy, two doors down didn’t. And it happened after I died. So I just needed to die again. In this room. And then I needed to figure out what to do next. We all got reset, but only I had the memories. But all three of them behaved similarly to before. Was that fate? Were they destined to repeat the same actions?

Looking at Carmen, I wondered if she would reset if she was dead? I knew that I would. At least, I was fairly confident. What if she remained dead on the floor when I reset? Or disappeared altogether?

Darren seemed to press something on the screen.

It was a risk I needed to take. I was in a bad situation. Deal with the known over the unknown. I knew what these two would do. I didn’t know what the Pantheon wanted. My problem was that I didn’t want to give the gem up until I had some idea of what would happen to me. Like I said, I’m no martyr. And I wasn’t about to let Carmen be martyred for me either.

As Darren concentrated on the invisible screen, I took my chance. I kicked out at his knee, forcing him to the floor, then reached for the hand holding the machete. I grabbed the wrist and twisted it forcing him to drop the blade, before I picked it up and struck it with as hard a swing as I could. I embedded the blade halfway through his neck and heard his pathetic splutter as he tried to understand what had just happened.

Then I felt a sledgehammer to my chest, a thunderous boom in its wake and looked down. Another boom and I fell backwards against the dining table. I looked up at Michelle, wisps of smoke floating above the muzzle of the shotgun she held in her hands. She was a strong woman, I could tell. No tears in her eyes. No regrets. Just a small hint of satisfaction. She seemed like the kind of woman who always knew she might have to bury her son first.

I smiled at her as I felt the life leaving me.

I looked down at the lifeless body of Carmen at my feet, and as my eyes closed, I hoped I was right.",1,1751551236.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1lqqbrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lqqbrf/evaluate_best_coffee_maker_for_office_use_is/,Evaluate Best Coffee Maker for Office Use Is Keurig K1500 Worth It,"Testing a product like the Keurig K1500 Coffee Maker has been an everyday ritual here in my busy home office setting. This coffee machine stands as an all-in-one brewing powerhouse, poised to deliver a streamlined and efficient coffee-making experience. Having used it for weeks, I feel I’ve gained some insight into its perks and quirks, making me eager to share how well it fit into my lifestyle, and where it might fall short for others.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The modern aesthetic of this coffee maker is something I immediately appreciated. With its sleek black exterior and compact dimensions (12.1""D x 10.3""W x 12.4""H), it snugly fits into tight kitchen corners or office break rooms without becoming an eyesore. I’ve had some clunky coffee makers in the past, but this one feels thoughtfully designed. The buttons are intuitive to use, and the build material feels durable, able to withstand daily coffee brewing marathons. It’s remarkably light too, weighing only 12.2 pounds, making relocation between rooms manageable even if you’re all on your own.

**Performance Features**  
What really impressed me was the fully automated functionality and the customizable brewing options. With four cup sizes available (6 oz., 8 oz., 10 oz., and 12 oz.), it catered to both my “quick pick-me-up espresso” mood and my “extra-large mug to last till lunch” needs. The STRONG button was one of my favorites, delivering an intensified coffee flavor, which surprisingly appeased a die-hard dark roast-loving friend of mine. Quiet Brew Technology is no exaggeration either—it brewed away without that loud “clacking” noise that my old machine always suffered from.

**Key Benefits**  
- The extra-large, 96-ounce water reservoir means fewer refill trips in the middle of a meeting.  
- Brewing delicious coffee, tea, and even hot cocoa with disposable K-Cup pods is incredibly convenient.  
- The STRONG button that amplifies flavor and aroma was a game-changer for richly brewed cups.

**Ease of Use**  
In terms of everyday functionality, the Keurig K1500 is straightforward for anyone to use—even my tech-averse dad could operate it without getting frustrated. The water reservoir is removable, making it easy to fill and clean. However, I did find that it lacks a water-level indicator, so occasionally I’d start brewing only to discover mid-brew that the water had run out. While this isn’t a massive deal for someone keeping tabs on it, it might frustrate someone rushing through a busy morning schedule.

**Drawbacks**  
- The coffee pod usage over time can add up, especially for families or larger offices, compared to traditional ground coffee.  
- Lacks advanced temperature controls for those wanting precise heat adjustments.  
- No built-in frother, which might disappoint latte and cappuccino enthusiasts.

**Energy Efficiency and Maintenance**  
The automatic shut-off feature takes a solid step towards energy conservation. I appreciated that it powered down when idle for an extended period—it gave me peace of mind after forgetting to turn it off post coffee rush. Cleaning the machine was painless, too. The drip tray is removable, which came in handy when one of my experimental coffee cups overflowed (never filling it up that high again). The exterior wiped clean without much effort, and the machine doesn’t stain easily.

**Competing Brands**  
When compared to its market peers, like the Cuisinart SS-10P1 or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Keurig K1500 shines in simplicity and ease of use. While those machines may offer a more diverse range of brewing options, such as ground coffee adaptability or built-in frothers, they tend to sacrifice user-friendliness for features. However, if frothy lattes or precise temperature control resonate more with your coffee preferences, alternatives might suit you better. On the flip side, competitors don’t always match Keurig’s longevity and the broad K-Cup pod compatibility. The K1500 remains a solid mid-tier option where convenience and reliability win over tech-heavy add-ons.

**Value Proposition**  
For the features offered, the price tag feels like an acceptable trade-off. It's ideal for small offices or individuals who prioritize quick setup, consistent performance, and minimal cleanup effort. It isn’t the cheapest coffee maker out there, but the simplicity and dependability make a compelling argument. If you’re someone who thrives on hassle-free coffee making, this machine delivers a lot of bang for the buck.

To share something we either need to login our whatsapp or go with email. As we were using our office laptops, we didn't want to login our whatsapp or chat via other platforms through our mail and it was a little complicated and a burden.

Tired of endless swiping and surface-level chats? Me too. I’m here hoping to find something real—a genuine connection with someone who’s as excited about life as I am.

Imagine this: spontaneous road trips with the windows down, deep conversations over coffee that last until sunrise, and laughter so contagious it leaves us both breathless. If you’re passionate about making the most of every moment and believe that life is better when shared, we might just be on the same wavelength.

A bit about me:
I’m an honest, straightforward guy with a healthy dose of curiosity and a knack for adventure. Average height, brown hair, and someone who loves staying active—whether it’s hitting the gym, hiking a new trail, or diving into a friendly game (sports or video!). I’m financially secure and believe in giving back, always ready to lend a hand or brighten someone’s day.

If you’re an animal lover, you’ll have to forgive me for stopping to greet every dog or cat we meet—bonus points if you do the same! 🐾

What I’m looking for:
Someone who values authenticity, open communication, and a relationship built on mutual respect. I believe the best connections are rooted in honesty, effort, and a willingness to truly listen. If you’re ready for meaningful conversations, shared adventures, and a partnership where both people show up, I’d love to get to know you.

If you’re only here for fleeting chats or aren’t ready for genuine connection, that’s totally okay—just not what I’m after. But if you’re ready to build something real, let’s see where this journey takes us. Swipe right on life, and let’s create our own story! ",1,1751551135.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1lqq9o3,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1lqq9o3/general_update/,General update,"I’m glad there’s a new flair since I last posted something, that’s literally what my past month has been about.
This is going to be a long post, my friends, so sorry in advance for any typos.

I haven’t opened reddit since my birthday, may 9th, and honestly, it’s been great.

I adopted a beautiful cat, got a permanent position at my company in early june, and I’m currently in the process of buying my very first house.
I’m really proud of myself: I’m only 23 and have managed to accomplish so much in such a short amount of time.
For people my age, especially in my country, it’s already hard enough to have a job, so I’m beyond proud and incredibly grateful.
Everything started happening after my sc shifted to a much more positive and strong one.

This is a community about SPs though, so now I’m gonna talk about him too.

After our last encounter (I have a post on my profile if you’re curious), even though we work in the same building, (different offices), I barely saw him during the days.
I also chose to cut contact with his colleagues. When we see each other we just greet, but I never ask them to stop by for a coffee or a small talk like I used to.
I just didn’t want to hear anything about him, or have them saying anything about me to him either.
I’ve been completely apathetic about him.

Three weeks ago, I wanted to “renew” my faith in my ability to manifest, and I asked to see a blue rose.
But I wasn’t really sure I’d actually see one, so I kind of forgot about it.
Four days later, I saw an ig story with a blue rose in it, and a little caption that said:

“The blue rose symbolizes achieving the impossible.
Artificially created, its blue color doesn’t exist in nature.
The impossible becoming reality.
When I first saw a blue rose, I saw an example of how to turn the impossible into something real.
A symbol of courage.
A symbol of defying the natural order of things.
I want to become someone who cannot be explained.
Someone impossible.” - Michael Kaiser

It didn’t help shake off my apathy, honestly.
I was like: “I knew it, that’s normal.”
I had also asked for crazy-colored cars, and saw them almost instantly after thinking about them.
I asked for those signs from a place of security and confidence, then I just forgot about it, but I noticed my “requests” are manifesting much faster now.
It used to take me at least a week to even manifest a lime green car.

After those little “tests,” I believe something deep down inside me reignited the spark.
I started thinking ""SP is no different from a blue rose or a crazy-colored car.
He’s just on his way to me""

Then something happened.

One day, I had to pick up a personal package for SP.
That was odd, because he had never ordered anything personal at work before, and had even told me on my birthday that he would never be near my reception again.
One of his coworkers picked up the package for him.

After that day, another one of his coworkers called me.
She was looking for a package that had been delivered on may 21st, and the system showed my name as the person who picked it up.
But since it had been almost a month, I didn’t really remember anything.
I called every office in the building, asking if they had this package, but they didn’t, and they also said they never order from that place.

A week passed, and my colleague called SP’s office to tell them I had looked for the package but couldn’t find it.
That’s when things got weirder: SP’s coworkers told her they had no idea what she was talking about. ???
She asked me to call them directly, clearly frustrated since they had kept calling both her and me about the package, and now they were saying they knew nothing?

She literally said: “I think you need to talk to them.”
(I had the feeling that this whole situation was just a reason for me to talk to them… Something similar happened in april: SP almost kissed me, but when I asked him about it on my birthday, he didn’t remember and said he didn’t know what I was talking about.
Tell me if I’m tripping or if something similar ever happened to you too, please!)

Long story short: I didn’t feel like calling them, and the next week, everyone forgot about the whole lost package thing.

But I’m posting because something happened this week.

On monday, SP came to my desk at a weird hour, (he usually clocks out much earlier), and asked if I had a package for him.
I greeted him normally, and I noticed he seemed kind of surprised to see me.
He stopped for a second after my “Hi!”
I found it strange because I had some packages, but none for him. They were for one of his colleagues who had already told me she would pick them up after her shift.
Since he’d used the same colleague to pick up his personal stuff before, it was even weirder for him to come in person.

I didn’t pay much attention to it, and I wasn’t even thinking about him like I used to.
The next day, I was getting coffee for myself and a friend who was waiting at my desk, and I got a call from a coworker of SP’s.
When I came back, my friend told me SP had passed by with that same coworker.
They weren’t looking for me, but it was weird they were together since SP got jealous of him some time ago because he tried to ask me out.

Since yesterday, SP keeps smoking just outside, right behind me, (there's like a tiny garden inside the building, his office is on the opposite side than mine)
Since there’s a glass wall, he definitely sees me when he does it.

I don’t know exactly how the universe is unfolding things, but I’m certain it’s doing what’s best for me and it’s happening right now.

As I said: SP is no different from the blue rose or the lime green car.

**Query**: 

Dear \[Name\], 

Complete at 84k words, SILVER FLOWERS AND WILTED LIES is a standalone adult Romantasy with series potential that may appeal to readers of SILVER ELITE by Dani Francis or THE BRIDGE KINGDOM by Danielle L. Jensen. \[Personalization\]. 

As the daughter of an army commander who values discipline above all, Cove Ravenhill has learned to strive for perfection—and always fallen short. When her rare magic lands her an assignment to secure a position of power in the enemy territory of Shai—where the commander’s successor is presumed dead, and soldiers her age are untrained—Cove sees an easy opportunity to finally earn her father’s favor by enlisting and climbing Shai’s ranks. 

To infiltrate, Cove must adhere to Shai tradition and drink a tea that binds her soul to another soldier’s. As bonding nears, Cove’s plan grows more complicated when her peers prove equal to her in skill—and when one of them is Sasha Sandos, the supposedly dead commander’s son. Sasha’s safe return from enemy captivity threatens Cove’s trajectory to leadership. Not only that, but after Sasha spots Cove’s magic and demands they bond to obtain it for himself, Cove is quickly thrust into his world—and the dangers that come with it. 

When demonic creatures targeting Sasha instead cause the death of an innocent, Cove and Sasha work together to unmask the summoner behind them. Despite his secretive nature and reputation for violence, Cove finds herself drawn to the softer side of Sasha—gentle, yet haunted by grief. With feelings for Sasha becoming impossible to ignore, demonic attacks recurring and gaining strength, and whispers of dark magic raising suspicions about the commander, Cove starts running out of lies to tell—especially to herself about her own loyalty, and how far she’ll go for the approval she’s spent her life chasing. 

I’m a Massachusetts-based debut author with a degree specializing in creative writing. The coastal setting of Shai was inspired by New England beaches, where I can be found reading in my spare time. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Warm regards, 

\[name\]

  
**First 300**: 

Cove knew before she’d even entered her father’s office that she was in for a crack to her knuckles.

She *had* tried on the official wedding attire that had been hanging untouched in the back of her closet all month—truly, she had. The garish blue fabric had clung in odd wrinkles on her breasts and hips, clearly designed for regal modesty instead of elegance, and the heeled leather boots made her look as if she were preparing for a hike and not a party.

Besides, it was merely *encouraged* that soldiers wear the uniform at Ashen weddings. The only issue was that for Cove’s father—Aschroft’s Archon—encouraged might as well have meant mandatory*.*

Cove sucked in an anticipatory breath before pushing through the door to her father’s study.

Tucked in the heart of Ashcroft’s tallest mountain, the army’s Archon—a word carried on from the old language, loosely translating to *leader*—had an office spacious enough to live inside. His large, pine desk encompassed the entire back of the room, with bookshelves lining the walls on both sides. To the left, a small reception area for the various Prefects who visited for coffee, planning, and other meetings important enough to be conducted in the Archon’s private chambers*.* To the right, a large map on a table, littered with parchments and pieces meant to represent the three armies.

Cove had spent hours at that table as a child, moving the little pieces around like it were some sort of game—ravens, waves, and horses. She’d make up a story for them, humming under her breath as she played, while her father held important meetings with important people around her. While a war raged on that she, as the Archon’s youngest child and only daughter, need never be a part of.

Like many things in the last decade, *that* had changed quickly.",1,1751550997.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

Hope you’re all doing well with treatment, recovery and living your best post cancer life. 

As well all know cancer sucks (BIG TIME) it steals everything from you and you don’t have a say in it unfortunately. BUT we are stronger than CANCER,CHEMO,LUMPECTOMY,MASTECTOMY,HORMONAL THERAPY and that shitty meds that we have to take. 

Lets share tips/advices on how to glow up and gain your confidence back. 
Lets talk about hair growth/post mastectomy tips/ weight loss and gain basically everything.

I will start 🙋🏻‍♀️

I was diagnosed 37 weeks pregnant 🤰🏻 i have gained 35+ kgs in this pregnancy i honestly stopped counting at 34 weeks😂. I had a lumpectomy and LN clearance then followed by 2 re excisions none was clear so decided to stop and do chemotherapy then mastectomy. And in order to do the DIEP my BMI must be below 32 and I had to lose the weight as soon as possible. I managed to drop around 32 kgs and that’s how i did it 👇🏼

I stopped eating out and even if i had no options i would choose the healthiest option possible. 

To make it simple for you guys,

I would eat this 👇🏼 from Mon-Fri
Breakfast: Eggs were my to go to everyday with brown toast and a cup of coffee.
Lunch: high protein lunch. For example a salad with chicken breast.
Dinner: greek yogurt and berries! 

And cook me some good meals on the weekends. Most of my food is homemade! I even make homemade burgers,pasta pizza you name it. (Whatever i make its definitely less calories)

Walking, as cliche as it sounds but it does work. It also helped me to get myself and the baby out and not think about whatever happening in my life at that time. 

Home ring mat Pilates, just check youtube you’ll find plenty of good instructors. 



I know someone out there need this. Youre not alone we are all in this together. Be kind to yourself. 💖

Hi everyone,

I am from France, and this is my first post ever… 

It’s been more than a year, I am so so soo miserable (mentaly and physicaly) I can barely talk and write… 

If there are some French people here who are willing to share (here or privately) their experiences with pericarditis, I would really like to hear about it, especially : 
- If and how you are dealing with Chronic and / or recurrent pericarditis ? 
- What (treatment or anything, really) worked for you ? 
- And if and where did you manage to get Arcalyst / Rilonacept ? 

I would also love to hear from anyone wanting to share anything, any hope or any experience they have with anything regarding peri and dealing with the pain and the flares, especially if you are in uni or working etc… Especially, whether any of you all managed to continue with light exercises (like walks or home bike) and drinking reasonable amount of coffee (like one cup during weekdays)…

Am I right in thinking that I have the right to be refunded onto the payment method I paid with? I have proof that the store was closed, and as I wasn’t able to get what I actually paid for, it seems unfair that they’re saying I can only use this money at Starbucks.

1lqq5qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lqq5qi/aio_girlfriend_made_me_feel_abandoned_during/,AIO: Girlfriend made me feel abandoned during strife & hasn't said a word since,"Listen, I know the answer to this, but I'm too stupid to listen to myself, so I'm here to be told I'm either stupid or over-reacting. This is regarding my girlfriend, we've been together a little over a year.

I (M31) am going through a very rough patch in my life. The kind that threatens your job, your home, & I've just lost my car (2 months before my company 2 hours away is recalling us back to office). Needless to say I'm under a lot of stress & have mental health issues.

Well one day I'm at her (F30) house (she lives with her parents) & I get back from looking at new cars & reality just really hit me. When it did, I folded. I haven't had a depressive episode like that since I was like 19, but all of the emotions & pressure just got the best of me & I just shut down.

She comes to check up on me & asks if I'm okay. I tell her ""No, not at all, & I'm just not going to be okay for a while, this is hard"". She says nothing & walks away. Eventually she comes back & lies in bed scrolling on her phone & watching TV. I couldn't help but feel incredibly unimportant & more alone than if she weren't there. There's a lot of other context to that feeling, she just doesn't really demonstrate any effort whatsoever in life or our relationship. If its even remotely difficult, she just won't even try. I've been trying to help her with that, but now with what's going on, I thought it could be time where I didn't have to be the rock & I could be a bit emotionally selfish, if not at least for a moment.

This feeling overwhelmed me & I got really anxious. So I got up & I went to the bathroom. I put in earbuds & listened to classical music on the floor & just tried to maintain good breathing. There was a weight in my chest & my heart was pounding & the anxiety was just absolutely debilitating. I haven't felt it in ages, I'm not well equipped to deal with that, so I tried my best, but I couldn't be next to my partner who seemed to not even care.

I don't know how much time passed, but eventually there was banging on the door, so I got up & walked out. It was my girlfriend & her mom asking me what I was doing. I said ""just sitting"" & went back to the room & lied back down. I hear her start crying & walk away.

Her parents come in & ask what's going on with us. I told them it had nothing to do with us & I'm not sure what she thinks is going on, but she could talk to me (she knows already every detail anyways). I tell them everything is going to shit & they essentially say ""you still gotta get up & pick up the pieces"" & that was it, that was what I needed. They recommended going for a walk to get endorphins going & I agreed.

I asked her (my girlfriend) to come with me & she agrees. We go for a little bit about 2-3 blocks & she says her feet hurt. I tell her I need to keep going (I didn't want to stop until I felt my breathing normalize & stop from choking up). I ended up walking about 3 miles until I got to the end of a trail, so I turned around & went back.

I get back & go sit with her. She says ""hey"" & stares at the TV. I sit there still drinking my water & just hoping she might say anything. She doesn't. So I go get a shower, come back, sit down, say hello to her, & she is still just dead panned on the TV paying me no mind. I couldn't take it, the anxiety was coming back, so I grabbed my iPad & went to sit downstairs & watch Rounders (a comfort movie). I make some food & she comes to the kitchen & asks if she can give me a hug. I give her a big hug & tell her I love her & ask if she wants to come sit with me. She does & then seeming like she wants to talk I then tell her how I felt & she said ""I just don't know what to say"". For months I've been trying to tell her ""just try, its okay to not know what to do, but ask & try, the only wrong move is to make no move at all"".

Eventually I get to the part of feeling alone & I tell her that right now I just can't be the one to carry everything (I do carry everything in the relationship; Emotionally, financially, I do her laundry, I cook for her, I go get the groceries, etc). She gets this tone & look like ""carrying what?"" as if I insulted her with something we've talked about for months like it was the first time. So I told her ""I already don't want to have this conversation right now, lets talk in the morning, I love you & hope you sleep well"". She walks away & that's the last time I've seen or heard from her since Saturday.

In the morning I get up & get coffee & breakfast & start work (side projects). She's AWOL hiding in her parents' room. Hours later her mom comes down & says ""She's not coming out, she's uncomfortable, do you want me to give you a ride home?"" (I just lost my car, I was supposed to pick up the new one near her house the next day). I texted her ""Your mom's offering to take me home, I'm packing now, I really really hope you'll stop me"". I just wanted her to confront this with me, but she's unwilling.

That's pretty much it. Her dad gives me a ride home. We talk about things. A few days later I need my money (she keeps the money because I'm bad with it) for the car deposit so I text her & sure enough, she sends the money, clearly seeing my texts. Anxiously I keep trying to talk to her, ask her for anything, try to call her.

Radio silence. Finally I offer her the easy out if she just wants to hide from things, she can just block me on Facebook & I'll delete her numbers & we can just accept this as closed (I don't want to block her because I'm emotionally unwell & will unblock her & reach out for closure).

Starting another prolonged fast, went 4 days last time but I want to try longer this time. If anyone wants to follow along for accountablity, tips, advice etc, would be great to partner up so feel free topost and comment.

I plan on posting daily updates here, probably best not to start new posts every day so save this one.

This is the plan:

For the next few days, I will be eating very low carb. I go on feeling, nothing scientific so it could be anywhere from 2-5 days. I do not weigh food, look at portions or anything, I eat until I'm full. Food: Meat, a lot of eggs, cheese, greek yogurt, maybe some vegetables like cooked swiss chard. I will usually eat a small piece or two of Zwieback toast with yogurt or cottage cheese. Oh, and nothing low fat, fat is good. I drink about 5-6 cups of espresso machiato without sugar or anything else and at least one 1.5liter bottle of cold sparkling mineral water daily.  
I find this makes fasting 10x easier if I do it that way instead of going cold turkey. I might get some multivitamin pills but no other supplements.

After the first few days I will start fasting. I will drink only black coffee without any additives and mineral and regular water. I will take electrolytes daily and maybe some vitamins.

I will do daily pushups and some moderate exercise.

The centerpiece will be a slate rock formation built around a small pump. The goal is to have part of the slate rise above the waterline, with a gentle trickle waterfall flowing down the rocks into the tank.

After a couple of hours experimenting with a mock setup, I’m still not happy with how it looks — it doesn’t feel natural or cohesive yet.

Some specific questions I’d love feedback on:

* Any tips for creating a more organic, natural look with slate pieces?
* How tightly should the slate formation enclose the pump? Should I leave space for fish to swim through or hide inside it?
* Does it make sense to only partially obscure the heater with rocks and plants, rather than trying to fully hide it?

I’ve included photos of the current mock-up layout, the collection of stones I have to work with, and the empty tank .

The coffee mug in the photos is just a placeholder for the pump — it’s a bit larger than the real thing to allow for clearance around the intake.

1lqpumv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lqpumv/explore_if_the_wacaco_nanopresso_ns_adapter/,Explore if the WACACO Nanopresso NS Adapter enhances your portable espresso experience review.,"The WACACO NANOPRESSO NS ADAPTER FBA deserves a comprehensive breakdown, especially since I've been giving it a daily whirl for my espresso needs. Having tried countless coffee gadgets, this one stands out for both its practicality and innovative design. Here's my journey testing it.

**Smooth Design that Fits Perfectly with Nanopresso Machines**

The design of this adapter is strikingly seamless with the Nanopresso machine. Its black stainless steel finish not only makes it visually appealing but also incredibly robust. The dimensions—2.44""D x 2.6""W x 2.44""H—ensure a snug fit, and I found that the compact sizing made it effortless to toss into my travel bag. Moreover, the fact that it's lightweight (just 6.4 ounces!) became particularly noticeable when I was hiking and needed to keep my load as light as possible. Even when you're bouncing between home and work, it's just so portable.

**Effortless Operation and Compatibility**

Its compatibility with NS capsules, including Nespresso originals, was a game-changer. I appreciate how precise these capsules are when it comes to grinding and measuring coffee, taking human error out of the equation. You can literally just pop in a pod, twist the unit closed, pump manually, and within minutes, you’re sipping on an espresso that's rich, creamy, and balanced—no guesswork involved. This convenience is unmatched, especially when I'm rushing through my morning routine before heading out to work. That said, I did encounter an issue once with pressurization because of a misaligned component. Luckily, swapping the adapter resolved the problem.

**Advantages**

- Completely manual operation ensures no need for electricity, which is ideal for outdoor adventures.
- Compatible with most NS capsules, which eliminates the hassle of handling loose grounds.
- Produces consistent, high-quality espresso with rich crema every single time.
- Compact and lightweight design, perfect for traveling or camping enthusiasts.

[Ready to snag WACACO NANOPRESSO NS ADAPTER FBA? See Amazon’s price.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b076dgy1ns/)

**Potential Flaws: Learning Curve with Capsules**

Not everything was perfect, though. Initially, there was a slight learning curve. You need to screw the lid precisely to create the proper seal; if you over-tighten or under-tighten, you might end up with leaky coffee or pods that won’t release. Speaking of pods, while capsule cleanup is way more convenient than traditional espresso grounds, I did notice that some NS capsule brands fit better than others—it’s worth experimenting to find the ones you prefer.

**Adverse Aspects**

- Some capsules don’t fit snugly, requiring trial and error for compatibility.
- If improperly sealed, pressurization issues can occur, leading to a burst pod or weak coffee.
- Material color limited to black; it would have been great to see more options for personalization.

**Who This Product is Perfect For**

This adapter shines for travelers, campers, or anyone who loves their espresso fix but doesn’t want to lug around a giant machine. It's also a nifty option for office use since its cleanup process won’t leave you dealing with coffee grounds in the sink (trust me, the janitors will thank you). That said, this is less suited for someone who thrives on making multiple cups at a time—it’s very much a ""single-serve espresso purist"" kind of tool.

**Product Competitors**

Comparing this to competing manual espresso devices like the Staresso Portable Espresso Maker or AeroPress, the compatibility with capsules makes this a standout product for minimalists. The AeroPress requires you to carry beans and a grinder while the Staresso is messier to clean. On the downside, alternative brands like Handpresso take an edge by offering sleek designs in various colors, although they lack this model’s precise Nespresso compatibility.

**Value for Money**

While similar capsule-compatible tools sell in the same price bracket, this one delivers superior longevity due to its high-quality materials. I remember hesitating at first, wondering if it justified the price for something as niche as an espresso adapter, but after daily use for weeks, it has more than proven its financial worth. Given how pricey espresso drinks at cafes can get, this device can recoup its cost quickly if you're a regular caffeine enthusiast.

Over the past two years, I put in serious effort to improve myself. Got into fitness, built a solid physique, took care of my skin, dressed better, became more confident. Not to impress anyone specifically—but yeah, deep down, I did hope that maybe someone would notice. Especially women.

I don’t expect people to fall for me just because I lift weights. But a little appreciation... a small compliment... some form of feminine attention… would’ve meant something. Because truthfully, I’ve never experienced that. Never had a coffee date. Never had someone ask how my day was. Never had a girl look at me the way I wish someone would.

I’ve been on dating apps, tried to start conversations, kept it respectful—but the matches are rare, and replies even rarer. It feels like women here already have a hundred options, and I’m just noise. Sometimes I wonder: is something wrong with me, or is this just how it goes for most guys ?

The same with calling people back or responding to texts he says he needs time to think of a response and confirm dates etc. and that it's because of his OCD. It must suck but it's annoying having to wait days for a text or call back so I usually wait for him to reach out. But about two weeks ago he pointed out it feels one sided he always has to make plans so this time I made plans assuming since he complained maybe he'll actually respond this time. I made plans to eat at this brunch place I've been wanting to try but three whole days go by and no response so on the third day I got annoyed and decided I'll just go with this girl I've been talking to.

Friday comes and he texts to confirm we'll go out to eat on Saturday and I told him sorry because I was going out with ""Lily"" because he took too long to confirm I made other plans. He didn't respond until an hour after that saying that I'm a horrible friend and I don't understand what it's like to live with OCD, but mostly he was accusing me of going out with Lily to mess with him because I've done it before and that I'm ""heartless"" and I never meant my apology. For context we have very similar types and sometimes he'll tell me he likes a girl but he wont make any move to sleep with or ask her out. So usually I wait a few days or weeks and sometimes I'll make a move usually not to date them just sleep with them, there was only one time I dated a girl he claimed he was in love with he got depressed so I broke up with her. This has been an ongoing issue with him since high school if he likes them so much he should talk to them.

No joke.,"I'll be on a work trip in Richmond next week and have more down time than I know what to do with, especially in the evenings. It'd be really nice to meet someone who's up for getting coffee and chatting... and making out afterwards. 

No prolonged small talk. No extensive messaging. Let's figure out where to meet, have some harmless fun, and carry on with our day.

What should you know about me?

* I'm a non-smoker and d/d free.
* I'm a visiting educator with a strong academic background. I'm doing this for the thrill, not out of desperation.
* I have very good hygiene.
* I won't create any drama for you.
* I'm 41, in decent shape, with luscious lips and a history of kink-friendly experiences.

What type of person am I looking for? Someone who...

* Is female.
* Actually wants to meet up. 
* Understands that this is just making out. 

Your race/weight don't matter much to me. It's just kissing, right?
This isn't some kind of bait-and-switch. If I wanted to post in other subreddits, I would have. If you're interested, I'm down to make plans soon :) Let's have a fun little adventure... and that starts by chatting and seeing if the vibes are good.",1,1751549665.0,VirginiaR4R,1,1.0,False

No need to spend any more than $30. Then go on Amazon and buy organic lemon balm teabags I get 100 pack. Put six tea bags where you would put the coffee grinds. Make sure to stack them on top of each other then fill the coffee pot with water and poured in the machine and brew. After it’s done set it on your countertop or stove top so it could cool off for an hour or so. Then put it in the fridge. Drink that like water it tastes great. Drink as much as you can throughout the day - when you work out or whenever. After about one to two weeks, you will feel a sense of calm and your nerve won’t be rattled. It’s the most amazing thing I’ve ever tried. I’ve been doing this for six months and only drink the tea and water sometimes. I don’t know why this isn’t known, but everyone should know about it.

  “Will you marry me?”  
  
  I didn’t know what to say.  
  
  I was Samantha Strattan. I’d been a nobody for so long, until Mason and Logan came into my life. Then I was Mason Kade’s girlfriend, or Logan Kade’s stepsister. I was theirs. It took a totally fucked-up summer for me to realize I lost who Samantha Strattan was somewhere along the way, and now my soul mate—the guy who was the air for my lungs—was asking me the question I recently realized was my nightmare.  
  
  “Mason.” No other words would come out of my throat. “I . . .”  
  
  I couldn’t breathe.  
  
  I couldn’t move.  
  
  I couldn’t look at him.  
  
  I couldn’t look away from him.  
  
  He wasn’t the nightmare. He was the dream.  
  
  The nightmare was my mother’s marriage. It was Mason’s parents’ marriage. It was all the cheating, lying, and bitterness. I would die if that happened to Mason and me.  
  
  What the fuck? What the effing fuck? Oh my God. Those words were on repeat in my head. I was in a horror movie.  
  
  I watched in slow motion as Mason’s eyebrows dipped when he realized I wasn’t saying anything. Then he realized I really wasn’t saying anything, and that said everything.  
  
  I felt myself falling backward, like someone pushed me off a cliff I didn’t know was behind me. I was falling . . . falling . . . I reached out, trying to get ahold of something—anything to stop this fall. All I could find was air, and I was going to land soon.  
  
  I saw the wall first.  
  
  It slammed down behind his eyes, and he donned an unreadable mask. His jaw clenched, and he shifted backward on his knees until he could stand. Once he was up, he began turning off the tea lights that surrounded us, making the clearing twinkle. I could feel the physical and emotional distance between us.  
  
  Smack!  
  
  I hit rock bottom.  
  
  “Mason.”  
  
  “No.” He shook his head. He was so cold now. “Let’s go.” He gathered up the blanket and headed back for the Escalade. He was almost there. He reached for the door handle—  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  It came out as a whisper. I shocked myself.  
  
  Marriage: that word terrified me. But cheating wasn’t me. It wasn’t Mason. We wouldn’t be liars. The bitterness would never come. I looked at him, watched as he froze and turned back to me. His back had been so rigid. He was still tense, but his eyes locked on mine.  
  
  I nodded, to him and for myself. Yes, I would marry him. Yes, I would love him forever. Yes, I would never let us be them.  
  
  “Sam?”  
  
  “Yes.” My voice was coming back to me. I nodded again. “Yes! I’ll marry you.”  
  
  He started for me. “Are you sure?” His head dipped down, still holding my gaze.  
  
  I nodded. I was. I really was. I lifted my arms as he met me, then swept me up in a hug.  
  
  “Yes,” I whispered again, burying my head in his shoulder.  
  
  He wasn’t James. I wasn’t Analise. We weren’t going to repeat what we’d seen growing up.  
  
  I lifted my head to find his lips. “I love you.” I kissed him with everything I had. I knew my hesitation had hurt him, and I needed to erase that. “Yes, I’ll be your wife.”  
  
  He held me tighter for a moment, then set me back on my feet. His hands fell to my waist, and he leaned back.  
  
  “Why the pause?” he asked.  
  
  He deserved the truth.  
  
  “Because I’m scared shitless about what our parents did. I’m scared of marriage. A part of me thinks it’s a crock of shit, after seeing what my mom did to David and hearing what James did to your mom.”  
  
  His face walled off again. My hands went to the tops of his arms, and I gripped tightly. I held him when he wanted to pull back. “But that’s not you and me. I’m scared—I have to be honest—but we can change the cycle. We won’t do what they did. What we will have, and do have, is already so much more sacred than what they thought they had.”  
  
  Understanding edged out some of the guarded expression on his face. He nodded, just once, just slightly. “Are you sure, Sam? I’ve always thought we’d get married, but I wasn’t planning on asking this early. It’s just . . . seeing your mom coming down that aisle, I wanted it to be you.”  
  
  Everything melted inside me.  
  
  My insecurities.  
  
  My worries.  
  
  My heart.  
  
  I was so humbled at that moment and wound my arms around him. What had I done to deserve this? Deserve him?  
  
  “I love you,” I whispered, my lips pressing against his skin. “So goddamn much.”  
  
  His hand came to the back of my head. “So goddamn much,” he repeated.  
  
  His phone rang, and Mason groaned against my skin.  
  
  “Fucking hell,” he cursed as he slipped his hand into his pocket.  
  
  When the phone appeared, we both glanced down. It was Logan, and we shared a look. He’d already called about the footage of the fight being leaked to Mason’s football coach. If he was calling again so soon, it wasn’t good news.  
  
  Mason hit the Accept button and put the phone to his ear. “Yeah?”  
  
  I started to untangle myself, but his arm just tightened around my back. He didn’t want to let go and, falling a little more in love (if that was even possible), I relaxed against him. My head rested on his chest.  
  
  “Are you coming back to Cain tonight?” Logan asked through the phone. He sounded tense.  
  
  I frowned, but didn’t lift my head. It felt too right to move.  
  
  “Uh . . .”  
  
  I looked up.  
  
  Mason lifted an eyebrow, wanting to know what I wanted to do.  
  
  We just got engaged. Time alone would be nice, though there was a huge crisis hanging over us. I wanted to stay in Fallen Crest, but I said, “We should go back. We won’t relax otherwise.”  
  
  He nodded, saying into the phone, “We’re coming back.”  
  
  “Good.” Logan sounded relieved. “I know you’re in deep shit because of the fighting, but I might need help with these guys that roughed up Taylor’s friend.”  
  
  “The same guy that we had to deal with a crime lord about?” Mason rolled his eyes.  
  
  “They beat the shit out of him because he’s gay. They deserve something worse happening to them,” Logan clipped out. “We can be inventive if you don’t want to do a beatdown with me.”  
  
  Mason’s voice was strained. “Start brainstorming, because I can’t do anything violent unless it’s on the football field. They’re going to watch me like a damned hawk, and that’s if I’m still allowed to play.”  
  
  “You’ll be fine, but yeah, Nate and I will put our thinking hats on. See you when you get here.”  
  
  “Yeah.”  
  
  Logan suddenly called out, “Hi, Sam!”  
  
  I moved closer to the phone. “Don’t get Mason in trouble, please.”  
  
  He groaned. “I might start trouble, but he always delivers the knockout punch. There’s a reason we work as brothers.”  
  
  Anger glinted in Mason’s eyes. His lips pressed together. “Okay. Be there in a few hours.”  
  
  He hung up and looked down at me. “You didn’t say anything.”  
  
  “Neither did you.”  
  
  “I was letting you make the decision.”  
  
  I pressed a hand against his chest, feeling his heart beat just on the other side. “I know. Let’s keep our engagement between us for a minute. Once we tell, it’s no longer ours. It’s everyone’s to talk about—and give their opinions about everything.” I tilted back to look up at him. “You know what I mean?”  
  
  His eyes darkened. I saw the love there. “I do.” He cupped  
the back of my neck. “I love you.” His lips found mine.  
  
  I closed my eyes, savoring this.  
  
  My man.  
  
  My other half.  
  
  My future husband.  
  
  So much lies ahead of us, but he was mine, completely mine, in this moment. My lips moved against his, deepening the kiss, and he tightened his hold on me.  
  
  Mason was driving, and I couldn’t stop from looking over and studying him. He wasn’t a boy anymore, not that he’d ever seemed like one. He was a man, and he was going to be my husband. It left me in awe. Forever. Though when had that word not been used to describe Mason and me? Never. But there was still a little voice in the back of my head that worried about repeating our parents’ actions.  
  
  “What’s wrong?” Mason asked.  
  
  “What?”  
  
  He gave me a half-grin, one hand on the steering wheel. “You seem like something’s wrong. Is it the engagement stuff?”  
  
  “Yeah.” I pressed a hand to my stomach. There were butterflies in there. “Does that bother you?”  
  
  “What? That my dad was a piss-poor husband or that your mom was psycho before?”  
  
  “Both.” I turned in my seat, pulling up one of my legs so I could sit sideways with the seatbelt still in place. I rested my head against the seat, watching him fully now.  
  
  His lips were perfect. I loved brushing mine against his, feeling his body tighten under my touch. His jawline—oh holy fuck, his jawline. It was strong, and it had made me weak in the knees too many times to count. His eyes, beautiful green that could look right into me. He would turn, see my eyes, and slide inside where he could read my soul. It had been like that in the beginning. It still was.  
  
  I never wanted him to stop seeing me.  
  
  And his black hair, it was newly trimmed back into a crew cut, but there was just the smallest amount for me to grab hold of it. That only made me salivate more for him. When he held himself above me, his eyes darkening in lust, his shoulders rippling from my touch, I loved how every part of him was defined and cut like a sculpture. He did it for football, training so many hours each day, and the thought of that made my heart hurt.  
  
  Football.  
  
  Everything would work out.  
  
  The league would let him play. He was Mason Fucking Kade. He was a star wide receiver on Cain University’s team, and he was mentioned on ESPN regularly. His draft was this year. Someone would take him. They’d be stupid if they didn’t.  
  
  I reached over and placed my hand on his where it rested on his leg. “It’ll get sorted out. You know it.”  
  
  He didn’t comment, just turned his palm upward and laced his fingers with mine.  
  
  I remembered what he’d said just before he proposed: that he was fucked. That the NFL doesn’t do scandals, and a video of Mason Kade beating the shit out of someone was one of those. It wouldn’t matter to them if he’d been protecting me, not once they opened up his record and started digging. There was a lot there. Mason and Logan had been fighting and setting cars on fire long before I came into their lives. They never bullied, but if they were hurt, they would hurt back. That was their rule. They reacted, rather than incited.  
  
  I knew they’d continue to do so, but there had to be a change. Mason tried before, and he learned to be smarter when he was defending himself. He slipped this summer and returned to the violence, but that was done.  
  
  They’d be smarter. They had to . . .  
  
  “Stop worrying,” he said.  
  
  “Hmmm?” I’d been staring at him, lost in my own head.  
  
  “You’re worrying. I can feel it.” His hand squeezed mine. “I believe you.”  
  
  My head lifted from the seat. “You do?”  
  
  “Yeah.” He glanced sideways at me, grinning again.  
  
  God—that mouth.  
  
  “You said everything will get sorted,” he added. “You’re usually right. I believe you.”  
  
  My heart pounded against my chest. “Good.” My voice was breathless. I don’t know why it affected me so much to have Mason believe in me. Mason always believed in me.  
  
  Whatever the reason, I was going to follow through. I knew Mason and Logan—even their father—would do anything necessary to ensure Mason’s future in football, but so would I.  
  
  My throat was full so I could only whisper, “I love you.” The feeling swept over me, leaving me renewed and invigorated.  
  
  He winked, his grin morphing into a smirk. “I know.”  
  
  I pretended to hit his arm, and the smirk turned serious. “I love you too,” he said.  
  
  Logan sent a couple text messages as we traveled, with the last one telling us to go right to Taylor’s house. We passed the exit that would’ve taken us to our house, and it wasn’t long before we pulled up at the large home where Taylor had grown up, but it wasn’t Logan or Taylor who met us at the door.  
  
  Taylor’s father, who was in his early forties, opened the door. He was a good-looking man with sandy brown hair. He kept himself trim, which made sense because he was also one of Mason’s coaches.  
  
  The two regarded each other.  
  
  Mason readied himself, adopting an unreadable mask and lifting himself to his fullest height. He never cowered for anyone. He wasn’t going to start now, but I knew he was tense. He respected Taylor’s father, Coach Bruce, nicknamed Coach Broozer. And Coach Broozer wasn’t looking very happy.  
  
  Finally, the coach moved back, and Mason and I stepped inside. He nodded to me as I passed, following Mason.  
  
  “Let’s go to the kitchen.” Coach Broozer led the way.  
  
  We walked through the small front entrance hallway and past the living room and stairs before turning in to the kitchen. I got the distinct impression no one else was home.  
  
  Broozer indicated the chairs in the dining room. “Take a seat.”  
  
  “I thought my brother was here,” Mason said.  
  
  “No.” He gestured to the kitchen. “Either of you want water or something else to drink? I can make a pot of coffee, or we have Gatorade. Mason?”  
  
  Mason sat at the far end of the table. I sat next to him.  
  
  “Nothing for me,” he said.  
  
  “Sam?”  
  
  I shook my head. I had a feeling we wouldn’t be here long.  
  
  “Why’d Logan tell me to come here first?”  
  
  Taylor’s father poured himself a glass of water and took his time settling into his chair. He took the far end, closest to the kitchen and opposite Mason and me. He leaned forward, resting his arms on the table, and paused another few seconds before taking a deep breath. His hands cupped his water glass, and he looked down, almost like he was going to talk to the table.  
  
  “It’s not the greatest, Kade.”  
  
  Mason’s jaw clenched.  
  
  “Logan said your case was thrown out, and I called the FCPD,” he continued. “They confirmed what he said, so I talked to the head coach, and he agreed. The whole department agreed. You’re back in time to start practicing with the team, so you won’t be suspended. Your case was dropped. There’s no reason to punish you further, but  I have to warn you . . .” His voice dropped ominously. “If word gets out about this video, or it gets leaked online and stirs up a fuss, we may have to handle it appropriately.”  
  
  “I’m good as long as no one knows about it or gets upset about it?” Mason’s jaw clenched. “Otherwise you’ll have to punish me to save face. Is that what you’re saying?”  
  
  Broozer’s eyes twitched before he nodded. “Yes.”  
  
  “That’s bullshit.”  
  
  “It’s the hand you’re dealt. You haven’t helped. That video was horrifying to watch. I know your reputation, and if a reporter starts digging, you could be made into an example.”  
  
  “An example of what?”  
  
  Broozer leaned forward, his eyes no-nonsense. “Of every other rich prick who gets away with murder.”  
  
  “I was protecting my girlfriend.”  
  
  “That’s not what they’re going to think.” He pointed out the window. “All those people who hate the wealthy and privileged. They ain’t going to see you as a guy who steps up and protects his loved ones. They’ll see your pretty face, find out how rich your daddy is, and see your record of violence. You’ll be slapped on the front of a magazine as the asshole who ‘got off.’ They won’t take the time to be educated about the real issue.”  
  
  Mason leaned back in his chair.  
  
  I eyed him. He didn’t look upset, but he didn’t show anything. He was closed off. Coach was being honest, and I knew Mason appreciated that, but I understood his frustration. It sucked. He couldn’t relax, knowing Caldron and Adam were behind him. Both douchebags from the summer were still hanging over his head.  
  
  I touched his leg under the table, and he looked at me from the corner of his eye. His hands remained locked together on top of the table, but his leg angled closer to me.  
  
  We heard car doors slam outside, and all looked over. We couldn’t see through the window from where we were, but Logan’s voice quickly carried over the distance.  
  
  “Look.” Coach Broozer straightened in his seat. He pointed toward the table and jabbed it twice. “I know what kind of kid my daughter is dating, and I know the lengths he’d go to for his brother. You can’t say a word of this to him. This could all go away if we don’t do a damned thing. You got it? If Logan knows, he’ll do something. He won’t be able to help it. He means well, but he could really fuck up your life if you don’t handle him right.”  
  
  Mason didn’t have time to reply.  
  
  The door opened, and Logan’s voice boomed through the house. “Mason! Sam! You guys beat us.” He was trailing behind Taylor as they walked around the corner. His arms spread wide. “So, what’s up my compadres?” He clapped a hand on Coach Broozer’s shoulder. “What’s up, Pop-n-Lock?”  
  
  “Pop-n-Lock?” Broozer echoed, his eyebrows drawing together. He turned toward Taylor. “Do I dare ask?”  
  
  She rolled her eyes, going to the fridge. “He started off calling you Pop-n-Law. That turned into Pop-n-Lock somewhere.”  
  
  Logan barked out a laugh and smacked the table. “You guys are back. Broozer had good news for you, didn’t he?” He rounded on his Pop-n-Lock. “What did you say to my brother? I thought he was off the hook.”  
  
  Taylor’s father opened his mouth, but Mason spoke first.  
  
  “I am, if no one makes a big deal out of it.”  
  
  Broozer shot Mason a dark look. “There went that whole plan of keeping quiet.”  
  
  Mason sent a look back just as quick. “Like I’m going to keep something from my brother.”  
  
  “Wait.” Logan frowned. He held a finger up, pausing as he looked from Pop-n-Lock to Mason and back again. “I’ll ignore whatever that was about. No one? Like, no one no one?”  
  
  “The opposite of anyone,” Mason said.  
  
  Logan gave his brother a look. “You know what I mean. We’re fucked. Everyone gets pissed at us. What about partying tonight?”  
  
  “Here’s a thought.” Coach Broozer’s tone turned sarcastic. “Why don’t you try not to get in trouble?” He took his water over to the sink. As he passed his daughter, he ran a hand down her arm, and they exchanged loving smiles. “And on that note, I have football tapes calling my name.” He clapped Mason on the shoulder. “Keep your head down. Don’t listen to that idiot brother of yours—”  
  
  “Hey!” Logan called, but he didn’t sound like he minded the statement.  
  
  “—And I’ll see you at practice Monday morning.”  
  
  Mason nodded. “Thanks, Coach.”  
  
  “Anytime.” He pointed at Logan. “Protect my girl. She’s my soul.”  
  
  Logan’s chest puffed up. “Always.”  
  
  Then Coach left us alone, disappearing back into the house.  
  
  Logan smirked, going right back to where he’d left off. “What about partying? Nate’s ready to throw a rager. We were going to do one at home, but we’re all up here now.”  
  
  Mason stood, taking my hand in his. “We’re going to have the party tonight, but whatever trouble your friend is in, I might have to sit this one out.” He looked carefully from Taylor to Logan.  
  
  Logan’s lips formed a flat line.  
  
  Taylor nodded. “That’s completely and understandably fine,” she said, looking at Logan. “This is about your future.”  
  
  Mason nodded.  
  
  I felt relieved.  
  
  The only one who seemed to want to protest was Logan. His eyes found mine and narrowed. “You haven’t said a word. What do you think?”  
  
  I frowned. “About what?”  
  
  “What I need help with. Those guys are assholes. They almost put Delray in the hospital.”  
  
  “You’re kind of exaggerating.” Taylor bit her lip and looked at me. “But Jason was hurt bad. And I do think they’ll do it again.”  
  
  “Decision made. We go and fuck ’em up instead,” Logan announced.  
  
  “Yeah, without me,” Mason countered. “I can’t fight. Probably never again.”  
  
  “Come on. For real?”  
  
  “Yes,” Mason ground out. His hand tightened over mine, and I looked up in concern. Logan was pushing him. Mason always wanted to be there to cover his brother’s back, but he couldn’t. He had to stay under the radar, and it was killing him.  
  
  I moved in front of him, pulling my hand free. I folded my arms over my chest and felt Mason’s hands fall to my waist. “Stop it, Logan.”  
  
  “Stop what?”  
  
  “Being a dumbass. You’re looking for trouble because you’re bored. You know it.”  
  
  He bristled. “Delray was beat up. Taylor’s mine, so that means he’s mine. How can I—”  
  
  “There are other ways!” My patience snapped. “And fine, whatever. Go beat the shit out of them, but stop making Mason feel guilty about it. If you want his help, do it another way. If you don’t, then respect his decision.”  
  
  Taylor laughed. “I just got a glimpse into your guys’ future. Logan trying to get shit going, Mason trying to be smart about it, and Samantha finally delivering the last word on it.” She whistled under her breath, giving her boyfriend a wolfish grin. “You guys will never lead boring lives. Ever.”  
  
  Logan shot a grin back, moving to the kitchen and scooping an arm around her waist. He pulled her against him, half lifting her in the air. “Only because you’re going to be there right with us.” He wrapped his other arm around her and buried his face in her neck.  
  
  She shrieked in laughter, hitting his arm. “You know that tickles. Stop it!”  
  
  Logan pulled back, a pleased look on his face, and grinned down at her. “Just wait till we get back to my place. I’ll show you what tickles. I’ll show you real deep how some things can tickle.”  
  
  Then he glanced around, a teasing smile on his face. “Are we ready to party?”  
  
  We were ready to party.  
  
  The music pounded.  
  
  Cain University students, football players, and students from the other private college in town filled our house. The booze flowed, and everyone was having a great time.  
  
  Mason sat at the bonfire with Nate and some of his football teammates. Logan sto  
od behind them, holding a beer and throwing horseshoes with Matteo as his partner. They were playing against two guys I didn’t know, and there was a lot of shit-talking going back and forth.  
  
  I stood behind the outside bar, filling drinks. I saw some of my floormates from freshman year, but our friendships had faded last year. They’d gotten busy with their own lives, and I was with Mason and Logan. That should’ve been enough for me. Right?  
  
  I studied Mason as he listened to Nate. The bonfire lit up his face, but also cast such darkness over his chiseled features. My heart lurched, and I felt it start to move up to my throat. I tried pushing down whatever emotion was there, filling me up. It wasn’t a good one; that I knew.  
  
  “Do you moonlight as a bartender now?”  
  
  Taylor slid onto one of the barstools and flashed me a grin. She was teasing, but our eyes caught and held as a shared memory passed between us. There’d been another party and another bar we’d hidden behind not long ago.  
  
  I laughed and pointed toward an empty jar. “Maybe I should put a sign in front of it for tips?”  
  
  She snorted, crossing her arms on the counter. “At this rate, you might get some. People are drunk—like, really drunk.”  
  
  A girl shrieked, and we followed the sound. A guy chased her around the yard. She was half-naked—her breasts hanging out and her jeans undone. Her hair was messy and her lips smudged, but she followed that shriek with a laugh. She flew past the bar, and I wasn’t the only one who stopped to watch her. Most of the guys took notice.  
  
  She shrieked again, the sound ending in a lust-filled groan when the guy caught up to her. He wrapped an arm around her waist and pressed her up against the house. His mouth was on hers, and she was soon clutching at his shoulders. Her legs climbed up to wrap around his waist.  
  
  Taylor sighed, watching them. “A part of me thinks she’s an idiot, so maybe she should deal with the consequences.” She pointed to a few guys who’d pulled out their phones to record the live porno. “But the other side of me knows we have to step in, especially if she’s intoxicated.”  
  
  A couple of girls came around the corner from the same direction the drunk and half-naked couple had come. Both were my height and slim. One had dark hair, and the other had curly, light-blond hair and a fairer complexion. The first girl seemed to be their leader. Her square jaw held a tight frown, and her hair was pulled back into a fierce braid. The lighter complexioned girl had more of a bounce to her walk, and probably a bit more pep in her personality. She also had a smile tugging at her lips, but when they both paused, seeing the two making out, the smile disappeared behind her hand. Her eyes widened in mortification.  
  
  The fierce braid girl turned to her friend. “What the fuck are we going to do? She’s unhinged.”  
  
  The second friend’s shoulders shook as she tried to keep in her laugh. She couldn’t. She doubled over, and her laughter rang out. “She’s going to regret that,” she managed with a snort. “So bad. It’s so bad.”  
  
  The first rolled her eyes. “Morons. That’s who I’m friends with.”  
  
  Taylor and I glanced at each other.  
  
  The second girl crumpled to the ground now, still laughing, with tears running down her face.  
  
  Fierce Braid just shook her head. Her hands found her hips, and she looked from the making-out friend to the one on the ground. “What the hell am I going to do?”  
  
  Taylor was holding back a laugh.  
  
  “You want a drink?” I called to the girl.  
  
  She looked over and blushed. “Tell me you didn’t hear that.”  
  
  I shrugged. “Sorry.”  
  
  She glanced around, and I knew why she’d assumed no one could hear her—because no one cared to overhear. The music still blared, and except for the two guys recording the making out, everyone else was absorbed with their own group of friends. Logan and Matteo were still playing horseshoes. I didn’t think Mason and the guys at the bonfire even knew about the half-naked couple, and there were a few other groups of girls, but they were watching the guys.  
  
  She shook her head and went back over to tap her still-laughing friend on the shoulder. “Grace, come on.”  
  
  The girl staggered to her feet and then half-collapsed onto a stool two over from Taylor’s. “Sorry. I’m—” Snort. “—Grace, and I’m completely—” Another laugh, followed with a hiccup. “—useless right now.” She turned wide eyes to her friend. “Sorry, Court. I suck.”  
  
  Court eyed the two guys with the phones. “I have to stop that. All of it. Nettie’s going to be mortified.”  
  
  “No, no.” Taylor slid off her stool. “I’ll get someone to deal with it. Trust me, he’ll enjoy it.”  
  
  Court and Grace, who was mostly hiccupping now, watched as Taylor headed through the crowd toward Logan. Their eyes widened.  
  
  “Is that Logan Kade?” one of them asked.  
  
  I looked over, but neither paid me any attention. The hiccups seemed to be gone, and Grace’s mouth hung slightly open.  
  
  Taylor touched Logan’s arm, and he bent his head toward her. A loving smile bloomed on his face, but then vanished as Taylor kept talking. His eyes narrowed, and he lifted his head toward us at the bar. I pointed to the couple, and he moved over so he could see them. He said something to Taylor, who started back to us as Logan then said something to Matteo.  
  
  Matteo passed along the message to Mason, gesturing to the recording guys. Mason stood, along with Nate, and the rest of the guys at the bonfire turned to watch.  
  
  Logan veered toward the bar, stepping behind it next to me.  
  
  He bent down, fitting the hose to the water supply and turning it on. I followed the hose to its end. Water streamed out where it lay next to the house—about five feet from the couple.  
  
  “You’re going to hose ’em?” I asked.  
  
  He winked at me. “It’ll be my pleasure.”  
  
  As Logan walked over to pick up the end of the hose, Mason stepped in front of the two guys recording with their phones. Matteo and Nate joined him to block their view. They protested and started to move—until they looked up and saw who was standing in front of them. Both snapped to attention then, trying to turn off their phones.  
  
  Mason said something I couldn’t hear and snatched their phones. The guys started to protest again, but soon realized half the football team was there and moving in. They’d back up Mason if they needed to.  
  
  Realizing they had no way to fight back, the two guys waited as Mason deleted the video from one phone. He’d handed the other to Nate, who seemed to be doing the same thing.  
  
  Logan now had the end of the hose in his hands, and he positioned himself with his feet set apart, holding the hose like a fireman might’ve. He jerked the end of the hose, pressed his thumb over the end, and blasted the porno couple.  
  
  The girl shrieked, and the guy yelled, his face twisted in anger. He whirled to find Logan with the hose and everyone else watching. The girl cowered against the house, her hands covering her breasts, and her bottom lip starting to tremble.  
  
  “Shit,” Court mumbled as she moved toward her friend.  
  
  Grace remained behind, one eyebrow raised as she watched everything unfold. A serene calmness had settled over her features, and she seemed content to remain in place, watching the scene like it was a movie.  
  
  As Court put her arms around Nettie, hugging her and helping to shield her, the guy she’d been making out with started to walk away. Logan wasn’t having it. He continued to spray him, laughing until anger darkened the guy’s face. He shot a hand out, but Logan just aimed the hose there, and the water splashed up, soaking the guy’s face.  
  
  I looked over. Mason was heading my way, the two phones in his hands. The phones’ owners were escorted away by some of Mason’s teammates.  
  
  “Are those two guys going to be a problem?” I asked.  
  
  Mason slid the phones over to me, ignoring the way Grace’s mouth hung open again. “I told ’em to come back tomorrow to get their phones. I want to make sure they didn’t upload that video somewhere.”  
  
  I checked the screens  
. Only one was password protected, and I held it up. “Did you get the password?”  
  
  He nodded, glancing over at Logan, who was still hosing down the now-yelling guy. “You know that girl?”  
  
  I shook my head and gestured to Grace. “But she does.”  
  
  He turned to her, his face unreadable. “Is that your friend?”  
  
  She lifted a hand to her chin and closed her mouth, then smiled at him. “Yep.”  
  
  He studied her. “You’re drunk?",1,1751549417.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1lqpnc5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqpnc5,The Palazzo at The Venetian Review + photos,"I recently stayed at The Palazzo at the Venetian in Las Vegas and thought I would post some photos and a review. 

I booked this property for 7 nights during the ‘glitch.’ The Palazzo did indeed honor the reservation and the price (10,225 points for 7 nights) 

The Globalist benefits at the Palazzo, and by extension The Venetian, are quite limited. When I booked this, I did not know that the Palazzo does not offer the breakfast amenity. Nor do they waive parking fee ($23/day) on award stays. Nor do they waive the $55 resort fee + $7.36 resort fee tax for Globalists. Nor do they provide daily waters. So it was not the inexpensive stay to earn 7 EQN I had initially envisioned. Lesson learned. 

They do offer late checkout, which I did not need. 

You can see the WOH benefits sheet that they provide upon checkin. It would be nice if all Hyatt properties had a sheet describing their benefits.

I reserved the Luxury King Suite. The room was lovely and spacious with a separate bedroom and living room. It included a guest powder room in additional to a palatial master bathroom, with a very luxurious shower experience. 

Housekeeping was daily without having to ask.

There was no daily water and there was no coffee maker in the room. A large Americano is $8 in the coffee shop. 

TLDR: the hotel is very nice. WOH benefits are nearly zero.

1lqpjbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lqpjbp/speak_by_laurie_halse_anderson/,Speak  by Laurie Halse Anderson,"  It is my first morning of high school. I have seven new notebooks, a skirt I hate, and a stomachache.  
  
  The school bus wheezes to my corner. The door opens and I step up. I am the first pickup of the day. The driver pulls away from the curb while I stand in the aisle. Where to sit? I’ve never been a backseat wastecase. If I sit in the middle, a stranger could sit next to me. If I sit in the front, it will make me look like a little kid, but I figure it’s the best chance I have to make eye contact with one of my friends, if any of them have decided to talk to me yet.  
  
  The bus picks up students in groups of four or five. As they walk down the aisle, people who were my middle-school lab partners or gym buddies glare at me. I close my eyes. This is what I’ve been dreading. As we leave the last stop, I am the only person sitting alone.  
  
  The driver downshifts to drag us over the hills. The engine clanks, which makes the guys in the back holler something obscene. Someone is wearing too much cologne. I try to open my window, but the little latches won’t move. A guy behind me unwraps his breakfast and shoots the wrapper at the back of my head. It bounces into my lap—a Ho-Ho.  
  
  We pass janitors painting over the sign in front of the high school. The school board has decided that “Merryweather High—Home of the Trojans” didn’t send a strong abstinence message, so they have transformed us into the Blue Devils. Better the Devil you know than the Trojan you don’t, I guess. School colors will stay purple and gray. The board didn’t want to spring for new uniforms.  
  
  Older students are allowed to roam until the bell, but ninth-graders are herded into the auditorium. We fall into clans: Jocks, Country Clubbers, Idiot Savants, Cheerleaders, Human Waste, Eurotrash, Future Fascists of America, Big Hair Chix, the Marthas, Suffering Artists, Thespians, Goths, Shredders. I am clanless. I wasted the last weeks of August watching bad cartoons. I didn’t go to the mall, the lake, or the pool, or answer the phone. I have entered high school with the wrong hair, the wrong clothes, the wrong attitude. And I don’t have anyone to sit with.  
  
  I am Outcast.  
  
  There is no point looking for my ex-friends. Our clan, the Plain Janes, has splintered and the pieces are being absorbed by rival factions. Nicole lounges with the Jocks, comparing scars from summer league sports. Ivy floats between the Suffering Artists on one side of the aisle and the Thespians on the other. She has enough personality to travel with two packs. Jessica has moved to Nevada. No real loss. She was mostly Ivy’s friend, anyway.  
  
  The kids behind me laugh so loud I know they’re laughing about me. I can’t help myself. I turn around. It’s Rachel, surrounded by a bunch of kids wearing clothes that most definitely did not come from the EastSide Mall. Rachel Bruin, my ex–best friend. She stares at something above my left ear. Words climb up my throat. This was the girl who suffered through Brownies with me, who taught me how to swim, who understood about my parents, who didn’t make fun of my bedroom. If there is anyone in the entire galaxy I am dying to tell what really happened, it’s Rachel. My throat burns.  
  
  Her eyes meet mine for a second. “I hate you,” she mouths silently. She turns her back to me and laughs with her friends. I bite my lip. I am not going to think about it. It was ugly, but it’s over, and I’m not going to think about it. My lip bleeds a little. It tastes like metal. I need to sit down.  
  
  I stand in the center aisle of the auditorium, a wounded zebra in a National Geographic special, looking for someone, anyone, to sit next to. A predator approaches: gray jock buzz cut, whistle around a neck thicker than his head. Probably a social studies teacher, hired to coach a blood sport.  
  
  Mr. Neck: “Sit.”  
  
  I grab a seat. Another wounded zebra turns and smiles at me. She’s packing at least five grand worth of orthodontia, but has great shoes. “I’m Heather from Ohio,�  
�� she says. “I’m new here. Are you?” I don’t have time to answer. The lights dim and the indoctrination begins.  
  
  THE FIRST TEN LIES THEY TELL YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL  
  
  1. We are here to help you.  
  
  2. You will have enough time to get to your class before the bell rings.  
  
  3. The dress code will be enforced.  
  
  4. No smoking is allowed on school grounds.  
  
  5. Our football team will win the championship this year.  
  
  6. We expect more of you here.  
  
  7. Guidance counselors are always available to listen.  
  
  8. Your schedule was created with your needs in mind.  
  
  9. Your locker combination is private.  
  
  10. These will be the years you look back on fondly.  
  
  My first class is biology. I can’t find it and get my first demerit for wandering the hall. It is 8:50 in the morning. Only 699 days and 7 class periods until graduation.  
  
  OUR TEACHERS ARE THE BEST …  
  
  My English teacher has no face. She has uncombed stringy hair that droops on her shoulders. The hair is black from her part to her ears and then neon orange to the frizzy ends. I can’t decide if she had pissed off her hairdresser or is morphing into a monarch butterfly. I call her Hairwoman.  
  
  Hairwoman wastes twenty minutes taking attendance because she won’t look at us. She keeps her head bent over her desk so the hair flops in front of her face. She spends the rest of class writing on the board and speaking to the flag about our required reading. She wants us to write in our class journals every day, but promises not to read them. I write about how weird she is.  
  
  We have journals in social studies, too. The school must have gotten a good price on journals. We are studying American history for the ninth time in nine years. Another review of map skills, one week of Native Americans, Christopher Columbus in time for Columbus Day, the Pilgrims in time for Thanksgiving. Every year they say we’re going to get right up to the present, but we always get stuck in the Industrial Revolution. We got to World War I in seventh grade—who knew there had been a war with the whole world? We need more holidays to keep the social studies teachers on track.  
  
  My social studies teacher is Mr. Neck, the same guy who growled at me to sit down in the auditorium. He remembers me fondly. “I got my eye on you. Front row.”  
  
  Nice seeing you again, too. I bet he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. Vietnam or Iraq—one of those TV wars.  
  
  SPOTLIGHT  
  
  I find my locker after social studies. The lock sticks a little, but I open it. I dive into the stream of fourth-period lunch students and swim down the hall to the cafeteria.  
  
  I know enough not to bring lunch on the first day of high school. There is no way of telling what the acceptable fashion will be. Brown bags—humble testament to suburbia, or terminal geek gear? Insulated lunch bags—hip way to save the planet, or sign of an overinvolved mother? Buying is the only solution. And it gives me time to scan the cafeteria for a friendly face or an inconspicuous corner.  
  
  The hot lunch is turkey with reconstituted dried mashed potatoes and gravy, a damp green vegetable, and a cookie. I’m not sure how to order anything else, so I just slide my tray along and let the lunch drones fill it. This eight-foot senior in front of me somehow gets three cheeseburgers, French fries, and two Ho-Hos without saying a word. Some sort of Morse code with his eyes, maybe. Must study this further. I follow the Basketball Pole into the cafeteria.  
  
  I see a few friends—people I used to think were my friends—but they look away. Think fast, think fast. There’s that new girl, Heather, reading by the window. I could sit across from her. Or I could crawl behind a trash can. Or maybe I could dump my lunch straight into the trash and keep moving right on out the door.  
  
  The Basketball Pole waves to a table of friends. Of course. The basketball team. They all swear at him—a bizarre greeting practiced by athletic boys with zits. He smiles and throws a Ho-Ho. I try to scoot around him.  
  
  Thwap! A lump of potatoes and gravy hits me square in the center of my chest. All conversation stops as the entire lunchroom gawks, my face burning into their retinas. I will be forever known as “that girl who got nailed by potatoes the first day.” The Basketball Pole apologizes and says something else, but four hundred people explode in laughter and I can’t read lips. I ditch my tray and bolt for the door.  
  
  I motor so fast out of the lunchroom the track coach would draft me for varsity if he were around. But no, Mr. Neck has cafeteria duty. And Mr. Neck has no use for girls who can run the one hundred in under ten seconds, unless they’re willing to do it while holding on to a football.  
  
  Mr. Neck: “We meet again.”  
  
  Me:  
  
  Would he listen to “I need to go home and change,” or “Did you see what that bozo did”? Not a chance. I keep my mouth shut.  
  
  Mr. Neck: “Where do you think you’re going?”  
  
  Me:  
  
  It is easier not to say anything. Shut your trap, button your lip, can it. All that crap you hear on TV about communication and expressing feelings is a lie. Nobody really wants to hear what you have to say.  
  
  Mr. Neck makes a note in his book. “I knew you were trouble the first time I saw you. I’ve taught here for twenty-four years and I can tell what’s going on in a kid’s head just by looking in their eyes. No more warnings. You just earned a demerit for wandering the halls without a pass.”  
  
  SANCTUARY  
  
  Art follows lunch, like dream follows nightmare. The classroom is at the far end of the building and has long, south-facing windows. The sun doesn’t shine much in Syracuse, so the art room is designed to get every bit of light it can. It is dusty in a clean-dirt kind of way. The floor is layered with dry splotches of paint, the walls plastered with sketches of tormented teenagers and fat puppies, the shelves crowded with clay pots. A radio plays my favorite station.  
  
  Mr. Freeman is ugly. Big old grasshopper body, like a stilt-walking circus guy. Nose like a credit card sunk between his eyes. But he smiles at us as we file into class.  
  
  He is hunched over a spinning pot, his hands muddy red. “Welcome to the only class that will teach you how to survive,” he says. “Welcome to Art.”  
  
  I sit at a table close to his desk. Ivy is in this class. She sits by the door. I keep staring at her, trying to make her look at me. That happens in movies—people can feel it when other people stare at them and they just have to turn around and say something. Either Ivy has a great force field, or my laser vision isn’t very strong. She won’t look back at me. I wish I could sit with her. She knows art.  
  
  Mr. Freeman turns off the wheel and grabs a piece of chalk without washing his hands. “SOUL,” he writes on the board. The clay streaks the word like dried blood. “This is where you can find your soul, if you dare. Where you can touch that part of you that you’ve never dared look at before. Do not come here and ask me to show you how to draw a face. Ask me to help you find the wind.”  
  
  I sneak a peek behind me. The eyebrow telegraph is flashing fast. This guy is weird. He must see it, he must know what we are thinking. He keeps on talking. He says we will graduate knowing how to read and write because we’ll spend a million hours learning how to read and write. (I could argue that point.)  
  
  Mr. Freeman: “Why not spend that time on art: painting, sculpting, charcoal, pastel, oils? Are words or numbers more important than images? Who decided this? Does algebra move you to tears?” (Hands raise, thinking he wants answers.) “Can the plural possessive express the feelings in your heart? If you don’t learn art now, you will never learn to breathe!!!”  
  
  There is more. For someone who questions the value of words, he sure uses a lot of them. I tune out for a while and come back when he holds up a huge globe that is missing half of the Northern Hemisphere. “Can anyone tell me what this is?” he asks. “A globe?” ventures a voice in the back. Mr. Freeman rolls his eyes. “Was it an expensive sculpture that some kid dropped and he had to pay for it out of his own money or they didn’t let him graduate?” asks another.  
r />   Mr. Freeman sighs. “No imagination. What are you, thirteen? Fourteen? You’ve already let them beat your creativity out of you! This is an old globe I used to let my daughters kick around my studio when it was too wet to play outside. One day Jenny put her foot right through Texas, and the United States crumbled into the sea. And voilà—an idea! This broken ball could be used to express such powerful visions—you could paint a picture of it with people fleeing from the hole, with a wet-muzzled dog chewing Alaska—the opportunities are endless. It’s almost too much, but you are important enough to give it to.”  
  
  Huh?  
  
  “You will each pick a piece of paper out of the globe.” He walks around the room so we can pull red scraps from the center of the earth. “On the paper you will find one word, the name of an object. I hope you like it. You will spend the rest of the year learning how to turn that object into a piece of art. You will sculpt it. You will sketch it, papier-mâché it, carve it. If the computer teacher is talking to me this year, you can use the lab for computer-aided designs. But there’s a catch—by the end of the year, you must figure out how to make your object say something, express an emotion, speak to every person who looks at it.

Some people groan. My stomach flutters. Can he really let us do this? It sounds like too much fun. He stops at my table. I plunge my hand into the bottom of the globe and fish out my paper. “Tree.” Tree? It’s too easy. I learned how to draw a tree in second grade. I reach in for another piece of paper. Mr. Freeman shakes his head. “Ah-ah-ah,” he says. “You just chose your destiny, you can’t change that.”  
  
  He pulls a bucket of clay from under the pottery wheel, breaks off fist-sized balls, and tosses one to each of us. Then he turns up the radio and laughs. “Welcome to the journey.”  
  
  ESPAÑOL  
  
  My Spanish teacher is going to try to get through the entire year without speaking English to us. This is both amusing and useful—makes it much easier to ignore her. She communicates through exaggerated gestures and playacting. It’s like taking a class in charades. She says a sentence in Spanish and puts the back of her hand to her forehead. “You have a fever!” someone from class calls out. She shakes her head no, and repeats the gesture. “You feel faint!” No. She goes out to the hall, then bursts through the door, looking busy and distracted. She turns to us, acts surprised to see us, then does the bit with the back of the hand to the forehead. “You’re lost!” “You’re angry!” “You’re in the wrong school!” “You’re in the wrong country!” “You’re on the wrong planet!”  
  
  She tries one more time and smacks herself so hard on the forehead she staggers a bit. Her forehead is as pink as her lipstick. The guesses continue. “You can’t believe how many kids are in this class!” “You forgot how to speak Spanish!” “You have a migraine!” “You’re going to have a migraine if we don’t figure it out!”  
  
  In desperation, she writes a sentence in Spanish on the board: Me sorprende que estoy tan cansada hoy. No one knows what it says. We don’t understand Spanish—that’s why we’re here. Finally, some brain gets out the Spanish–English dictionary. We spend the rest of the period trying to translate the sentence. When the bell rings, we have gotten as far as “To exhaust the day to surprise.”  
  
  HOME. WORK.  
  
  I make it through the first two weeks of school without a nuclear meltdown. Heather from Ohio sits with me at lunch and calls to talk about English homework. She can talk for hours. All I have to do is prop the phone against my ear and “uhhuh” occasionally while I surf the cable. Rachel and every other person I’ve known for nine years continue to ignore me. I’m getting bumped a lot in the halls. A few times my books were accidentally ripped from my arms and pitched to the floor. I try not to dwell on it. It has to go away eventually.  
  
  At first, Mom was pretty good about preparing dinners in the morning and sticking them in the fridge, but I knew it would end. I come home to a note that says, “Pizza. 555-4892. Small tip this time.” Clipped to the note is a twenty-dollar bill. My family has a good system. We communicate with notes on the kitchen counter. I write when I need school supplies or a ride to the mall. They write what time they’ll be home from work and if I should thaw anything. What else is there to say?  
  
  Mom is having staff problems again. My mother manages Effert’s, a clothing store downtown. Her boss offered her the branch at the mall, but she didn’t want it. I think she likes watching the reaction when she says she works in the city. “Aren’t you afraid?” people ask. “I would never work there in a million years.” Mom loves doing the things that other people are afraid of. She could have been a snake handler.  
  
  But the downtown location makes it hard to find people to work for her. Daily shoplifters, bums peeing on the front door, and the occasional armed robbery discourage job seekers. Go figure. We are now two weeks into September and she’s already thinking Christmas. She has plastic snowflakes and red-felt-wearing Santas on the brain. If she can’t find enough employees for September, she’ll be in deep doo-doo when the holiday season hits.  
  
  I order my dinner at 3:10 and eat it on the white couch. I don’t know which parent was having seizures when they bought that couch. The trick to eating on it is to turn the messy side of the cushions up. The couch has two personalities: “Melinda inhaling pepperoni and mushroom” and “No one ever eats in the family room, no ma’am.” I chow and watch TV until I hear Dad’s Jeep in the driveway. Flip, flip, flip—cushions reversed to show their pretty white cheeks, then bolt upstairs. By the time Dad unlocks the door, everything looks the way he wants to see it, and I have vanished.  
  
  My room belongs to an alien. It is a postcard of who I was in fifth grade. I went through a demented phase when I thought that roses should cover everything and pink was a great color. It was all Rachel’s fault. She begged her mom to let her do her room over, so we all ended up with new rooms. Nicole refused to put the stupid little skirt around her nightstand and Ivy had gone way over the top, as usual. Jessica did hers in a desert ’n’ cowdudes theme. My room was stuck in the middle, a bit stolen from everyone else. The only things that were really mine were my stuffed-rabbit collection from when I was a little kid and my canopy bed. No matter how much Nicole teased me, I wouldn’t take the canopy down. I’m thinking about changing the rose wallpaper, but then Mom would get involved and Dad would measure the walls and they would argue about paint color. I don’t know what I want it to look like, anyway.  
  
  Homework is not an option. My bed is sending out serious nap rays. I can’t help myself. The fluffy pillows and warm comforter are more powerful than I am. I have no choice but to snuggle under the covers.  
  
  I hear Dad turn on the television. Clink, clink, clink—he drops ice cubes in a heavy-bottomed glass and pours in some booze. He opens the microwave—for the pizza, I guess—slams it closed, then beep-beeps the timer. I turn on my radio so he’ll know I’m home. I won’t take a real nap. I have this halfway place, a rest stop on the road to sleep, where I can stay for hours. I don’t even need to close my eyes, just stay safe under the covers and breathe.  
  
  Dad turns up the volume on the TV. The news-team anchordude bellows, “Five dead in house fire! Young girl attacked! Teens suspected in gas station holdup!” I nibble on a scab on my lower lip. Dad hops from channel to channel, watching the same stories play over and over.  
  
  I watch myself in the mirror across the room. Ugh. My hair is completely hidden under the comforter. I look for the shapes in my face. Could I put a face in my tree, like a dryad from Greek mythology? Two muddy-circle eyes under black-dash eyebrows, piggy-nose nostrils, and a chewed-up horror of a mouth. Definitely not a dryad face. I can’t stop biting my lips. It looks like my mouth belongs to someone else, someone I don’t even know.  
  
  I get out of bed and take down the mirror. I put it in the back of my closet, facing the wall.  
  
  OUR FEARLESS LEADER  
  
  I’m hiding in the bathroom, waiting for the coast to clear. I peek out the door. Principal Principal spots another errant student in the hall.  
  
  Principal Principal: “Where’s your late pass, mister?”  
  
  Errant Student: “I’m on my way to get one now.”  
  
  PP: “But you can’t be in the hall without a pass.”  
  
  ES: “I know, I’m so upset. That’s why I need to hurry, so I can get a pass.”  
  
  Principal Principal pauses with a look on his face like Daffy Duck’s when Bugs is pulling a fast one.  
  
  PP: “Well, hurry up, then, and get that pass.”  
  
  Errant Student races down hall, waving and smiling. Principal Principal walks the other way, replaying the conversation in his mind, trying to figure out what went wrong. I ponder this and laugh.  
  
  FIZZ ED  
  
  Gym should be illegal. It is humiliating.  
  
  My gym locker is closest to the door, which means I have to change my clothes in a bathroom stall. Heather from Ohio has the locker next to mine. She wears her gym clothes under her regular clothes. After gym she changes out of her shorts but always leaves an undershirt on. It makes me worry about the girls in Ohio. Do they all have to wear undershirts?  
  
  The only other girl I know in gym is Nicole. In our old clan, we had never been very close. She almost said s  
omething to me when school started, but instead looked down and retied her Nikes. Nicole has a full-length locker in a discreet, fresh-smelling alcove because she’s on the soccer team. She doesn’t mind changing her clothes in public. She even changes bras, wearing one sports bra to regular class and another to gym class. Never blushes or turns around to hide herself, just changes her clothes. Must be a jock thing. If you’re that strong, you don’t care if people make comments about your boobs or rear end.  
  
  It’s late September and we’re starting our field hockey unit. Field hockey is a mud sport, played only on wet, cloudy days when it feels like snow. Who dreamed up this one? Nicole is unstoppable at field hockey. She motors downfield so fast she creates a wake of flowing mud that washes over anyone who gets in her way. She does something with her wrist, then the ball is in the goal. She smiles and jogs back to the center circle.  
  
  Nicole can do anything that involves a ball and a whistle. Basketball, softball, lacrosse, football, soccer, rugby. Anything. And she makes it look easy. Boys watch her to learn how to play better. It doesn’t hurt that she’s cute. She chipped her tooth this past summer at some kind of jock camp. Makes her look even cuter.  
  
  The gym teachers have a special place in their hearts for Nicole. She shows Potential. They look at her and see future State Championships. Pay raises. One day she scored 35 goals before my team threatened to walk off the field. The gym teacher made her the referee. Not only did my team lose, but four girls went to the nurse with injuries. Nicole doesn’t believe in the concept of fouling. She comes from the “play till death or maiming” school of athletics.  
  
  If it weren’t for her attitude, it would be easier to deal with all this. The crappy locker I have, Heather geeking around me like a moth, cold mornings in the mud watching Nicole, Warrior Princess, listening to the coaches praise her—I could just accept it and move on. But Nicole is so friendly. She even talks to Heather from Ohio. She told Heather where to buy a mouth guard so her braces wouldn’t cut up her lips if she got hit with a ball. Heather now wants to buy a sports bra. Nicole is just not a bitch. It would be so much easier to hate her if she were.  
  
  FRIENDS  
  
  Rachel is with me in the bathroom. Edit that. Rachelle is with me in the bathroom. She has changed her name. Rachelle is reclaiming her European heritage by hanging out with the foreign-exchange students. After five weeks in school, she can swear in French. She wears black stockings with runs and doesn’t shave under her arms. She waves her hand in the air and you find yourself thinking of young chimpanzees.  
  
  I can’t believe she was my best friend.  
  
  I’m in the bathroom trying to put my right contact lens back in. She’s smudging mascara under her eyes to look exhausted and wan. I think about running out so she can’t pull the evil eye on me again, but Hairwoman, my English teacher, is patrolling the hall and I forgot to go to her class.  
  
  Me: “Hi.”  
  
  Rachelle: “Mmm.”  
  
  Now what? I’m going to be completely, totally cool, like nothing has happened. Think ice. Think snow.  
  
  Me: “How’s it going.” I try to put in my contact, and poke myself in the eye. Very cool.  
  
  Rachelle: “Eehn.” She gets mascara in her eye and rubs it, smearing mascara across her face.  
  
  I don’t want to be cool. I want to grab her by the neck and shake her and scream at her to stop treating me like dirt. She didn’t even bother to find out the truth—what kind of friend is that? My contact folds in half under my eyelid. Tears well in my right eye.  
  
  Me: “Ouch.”  
  
  Rachelle: \[Snorts. Stands back from mirror, turns head from side to side to admire the black mess that looks like goose poop across her cheekbones\] “Pas mal.”  
  
  She puts a candy cigarette between her lips. Rachelle wants desperately to smoke, but she has asthma. She has started a new Thing, unheard of in a ninth-grader. Candy cigarettes. The exchange students love it. Next thing you know, she’ll be drinking black coffee and reading books without pictures.  
  
  An exchange student flushes and comes out of the stall. This one looks like a supermodel with a name like Greta or Ingrid. Is America the only country with dumpy teenagers? She says something foreign and Rachelle laughs. Right, like she understood.  
  
  Me:  
  
  Rachelle blows a candy cigarette smoke ring at my face. Blows me off. I have been dropped like a hot Pop Tart on a cold kitchen floor. Rachelle and Greta–Ingrid glide out of the bathroom. Neither one of them has toilet paper stuck to her boots. Where is the justice?  
  
  I need a new friend. I need a friend, period. Not a true friend, nothing close or share clothes or sleepover giggle giggle yak yak. Just a pseudo-friend, disposable friend. Friend as accessory. Just so I don’t feel and look so stupid.  
  
  My journal entry for the day: “Exchange students are ruining our country.”  
  
  HEATHERING  
  
  As we ride home on Heather’s bus, she tries to bully me into joining a club. She has a Plan. She wants us to join five clubs, one for every day of the week. The tricky part is choosing the clubs that have the Right People. Latin Club is out of the question, as is Bowling. Heather actually likes bowling—it was a big thing in her old school—but she has seen our bowling lanes and she could tell that no Right Person would set foot in there.  
  
  When we get to Heather’s house, her mother meets us at the door. She wants to hear all about our day, how long I’ve lived in town, and asks little sideways questions about my parents, so she can figure out if I’m the kind of friend she wants for her daughter. I don’t mind. I think it’s nice that she cares.  
  
  We can’t go in Heather’s room because the decorators aren’t finished. Armed with a bowl of orange popcorn and diet sodas, we retreat to the basement. The decorators finished that first. You can hardly tell it’s a basement. It’s covered in carpeting nicer than we have in our living room. A monster TV glows in a corner, and there’s a pool table and exercise equipment. It doesn’t even smell like a basement.  
  
  Heather hops on the treadmill and resumes scheming. She isn’t finished with her survey of Merryweather’s social scene, but she thinks the International Club and the Select Chorus will be a good place to start. Maybe we can try out for the musical. I turn on the television and eat her popcorn.  
  
  Heather: “What should we do? What do you want to join? Maybe we should tutor at the elementary school.” She increases the speed of the treadmill. “What about your friends from last year? Don’t you know Nicole? But she does all those sports, doesn’t she? I could never do sports. I fall down too easy. What do you want to do?”  
  
  Me: “Nothing. The clubs are stupid. Want some popcorn?”  
  
  She edges up the treadmill speed and breaks into a sprint. The treadmill is so loud I can hardly hear the television. Heather wags her finger at me. Hanging back is a common mistake most ninth-graders make, she says. I shouldn’t be intimidated. I have to get involved, become a part of the school. That’s what all the popular people do. She turns down the treadmill and wipes her brow with a thick towel that hangs off the side of the machine. After a few minutes of cooling down, she hops off. “A hundred calories,” she crows. “Want to try?”  
  
  I shudder and hold out the popcorn bowl to her. She reaches right past me and takes a pen topped with a Merryweather Purple ball of fluff off the coffee table. “We must make plans,” she says solemnly. She draws four boxes, one for each marking period, then writes “GOALS” in each box. “We won’t get anywhere without knowing our goals. Everyone always says that and it is so true.” She opens her soda. “What are your goals, Mel?”  
  
  I used to be like Heather. Have I changed that much in two months? She is happy, driven, aerobically fit. She has a nice mom and an awesome television. But she’s like a dog that keeps jumping into your lap. She always walks with me down the halls chattering a million miles a minute.  
  
  My goal is to go home and take a nap.  
  
  BURROW  
  
  Yesterday Hairwoman yanked me from study hall and forced me to make up my “missing” homework in her room.  
(She made fluttering noises of concern and mentioned a meeting with my parents. Not good.) Nobody bothered to tell me that study hall was being held in the library today. By the time I find it, the period is almost over. I’m dead. I try to explain to the librarian, but I keep stuttering and nothing comes out right.

# Beer soap: Best 2025 Reviews & Buying Guide

The beer soap market has exploded in recent years, transitioning from a novelty item to a legitimate skincare option. Infused with the natural goodness of beer, these soaps offer a unique blend of cleansing and moisturizing properties. This buying guide aims to provide a extensive overview of the best beer soaps available in 2025, helping you make an informed decision based on your skin type, preferences, and desired benefits. we'll explore key features, analyze core benefits, address frequently asked questions, compare it with top competitor products, define the ideal user profile and conclude with buying recommendations.

## Key Features analysis

The best beer soaps boast several features that set them apart from conventional soaps. These features contribute to their effectiveness, skin compatibility, and overall user experience.

**Hops-Infused Formula:**

hops are a primary ingredient in beer, and they carry their beneficial properties over into beer soap. They are known for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities, which can definitely help calm irritated skin and combat acne-causing bacteria. The natural alpha acids in hops may also contribute to exfoliation, revealing brighter, smoother skin.

**barley-Based Cleansing:**

Barley, another key component of beer, provides gentle cleansing action. Its natural enzymes and amino acids help remove dirt and impurities without stripping the skin of its essential oils. This gentle cleansing action is notably helpful for individuals with sensitive or dry skin who find commercial soaps too harsh.

**Glycerin-Rich Composition:**

Many beer soap manufacturers incorporate glycerin into their formulas. Glycerin is a humectant, meaning it attracts moisture from the air and binds it to the skin. This results in a deeply hydrating lather that leaves the skin feeling soft and supple even after rinsing. The inclusion of glycerin helps counteract the drying effects that some soaps can have.

**Natural Oil Additives:**

High-quality beer soaps enhance their conditioning properties with natural oils such as coconut oil, olive oil, and shea butter. Coconut oil contributes to a rich, creamy lather and provides additional moisturizing benefits. Olive oil contains antioxidants that protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals. Shea butter is known for its emollient properties, helping to soothe and soften the skin.

**Artisan Craftsmanship and Scent Profiles:**

Many beer soaps are made in small batches by artisan soap makers,focusing on quality and unique scent profiles.these scent profiles often incorporate essential oils such as cedarwood, sandalwood, citrus, pine or even coffee, creating a pleasant and refreshing bathing experience. The use of natural essential oils also avoids synthetic fragrances, which can irritate sensitive skin.

Key features of the Beer Soap include:

  Hops-infused formula.
  Barley-based cleansing.
  Glycerin-rich composition.
  Natural oil additives.
 Artisan craftsmanship and scent profiles.

## Core Benefits

Beer soap offers a range of benefits that extend beyond basic cleansing. From improved skin health to unique sensory experiences, here are some core advantages.

**Moisturized and Hydrated Skin:** The combination of glycerin and natural oils in beer soap provides intense hydration. By locking in moisture, the soap helps prevent dryness, flakiness, and itchiness.Regular use can led to noticeably softer, smoother, and more supple skin, particularly beneficial for users in dry climates or with naturally dry skin.

**Reduced skin Irritation:** The anti-inflammatory properties of hops can significantly reduce skin irritation caused by conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and acne. It helps to soothe redness,itching,and swelling,promoting a more balanced and comfortable skin tone. This makes beer soap a gentler alternative to conventional soaps containing harsh chemicals.

**Enhanced Exfoliation and Skin Renewal:** The natural enzymes in barley help to exfoliate the skin gently, removing dead skin cells and promoting cell turnover. This leads to a brighter, more radiant complexion and reduces the appearance of blemishes and imperfections. It's a natural and less abrasive alternative to chemical exfoliants.

**Unique Sensory Experience:** Unlike mass-produced soaps,beer soap often features artisan scent profiles derived from essential oils. This creates a pleasant and refreshing bathing experience that invigorates the senses. The aroma of beer combined with natural essential oils elevates the bathing routine from a mundane chore to a luxurious and therapeutic experience.

**Natural and Sustainable:** Many beer soap manufacturers prioritize natural ingredients and sustainable production practices.This means that you're not only benefiting your skin but also supporting environmentally conscious businesses. Choosing beer soap over conventional soaps can reduce your exposure to synthetic chemicals and promote a more eco-friendly lifestyle.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about beer soap.

**Will beer soap make me smell like beer?**
No, beer soap will not leave you smelling like beer. while some beer soaps do have a subtle malt aroma, it's typically masked by other natural fragrances, such as essential oils. The process of saponification converts the beer's sugars and alcohol into soap, so the characteristic smell is largely eliminated.

**Is beer soap suitable for sensitive skin?**

Yes, in most cases. The gentle cleansing action of barley and the addition of moisturizing ingredients like glycerin and natural oils make beer soap a good option for sensitive skin. However, it is essential to check the ingredient list for any potential allergens or irritants. Look for soaps that are free from artificial fragrances, dyes, and harsh chemicals.

**Can I use beer soap on my face?**

Yes, you can use beer soap on your face if it is formulated for facial use. Choose a beer soap with gentle ingredients and a pH level that is close to the skin's natural pH. Avoid soaps that contain harsh exfoliants or excessive amounts of alcohol, as these can strip the skin of its natural oils.**Does beer soap lather well?**

The lathering ability of beer soap varies depending on the ingredients used. Soaps with a high concentration of coconut oil tend to produce a rich, creamy lather, while those with a greater proportion of olive oil may produce a gentler lather.

## Competitor Comparison

Here’s a comparison of beer soap versus commercial soap and other natural alternatives.### Product Comparison Overview

#### Beer Soap

   **Cleansing Agent**: Barley-based,gentle cleansing action.
   **Moisturization**: Typically contains glycerin and natural oils for hydration.
   **Key Ingredients**: Hops and barley extracts.

#### Commercial Soap

   **Cleansing Agent**: Harsh detergents and surfactants.
   **Moisturization**: Often lacks natural moisturizers; may contain synthetic emollients.
   **Key Ingredients**: Synthetic chemicals, artificial fragrances, and dyes.
 Scent Profile: Frequently enough by artificial fragrance

#### Other Natural Soaps (e.g., Goat Milk soap)

   **Cleansing Agent**: Natural fats and oils.
   **Moisturization**: Rich in naturally occurring fats and fatty acids.
   **Key Ingredients**: Goat milk, olive oil, coconut oil, and shea butter.

The addition of unique scent profiles sets hops soap apart.

## Ideal User Profile

Here are some specific user types who benefit most from beer soap.

**Individuals with Sensitive Skin:** Beer soap’s gentle but effective ingredients offer gentle properties to individuals with sensitive skin. Its gentle cleansing and soothing properties help reduce the risk of irritation, making it a good option for daily use.

**Those seeking Anti-Inflammatory Benefits:** People with conditions like acne, eczema, or psoriasis can significantly benefit from the anti-inflammatory properties of hops. The active compounds help soothe irritated skin, reduce redness, and promote healing.

beer soap is a unique addition to the market offering a gentle, and naturally scented approach to bathing. This gentle bar provides a rich lather alongside its natural ingredients profile. While not without quirks, beer soap offers a grate balance to those key ingredients.

* Norway - sounds like Karsk (coffee & grain alcohol/moonshine) is a classic Scandinavian drink so that might be an idea here

I come back… laptop’s gone.

Panic sets in. I ask the guy. He says, “Someone came and grabbed it, I thought they knew you.” I sprint outside looking for this supposed thief, yelling “HEY! HEY! GIVE THAT BACK!”

I grab his shoulder, panting, and yell, “You took my stuff!”

He just stares at me.

Then I hear, “Dude… it’s in your hand.”

We use heart emojis in our chats to react to stuff, and generally get along quite well, and match each other sense of humor.

But she never reaches out. And she politely declined my invites to grab coffee. I'm afraid to ask again, even though she had an excuse each time. I'd think if she was interested she'd ask me.

1lqp6ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lqp6ch/the_game_plan_by_r_l_mathewson/,The Game Plan by R. L. Mathewson,"  Chapter 1  
  
  “I love my wife. ”  
  
  “Yes, but-” Jodi started to say only to get cut off once again before she could explain why she desperately needed to be released from her lease.  
  
  “I love my wife,” Trevor Bradford, her landlord and a man that she suspected was as close to committing murder as she was, stressed for what had to be the hundredth time since he’d arrived at her apartment five minutes ago.  
  
  Jodi released an exasperated sigh as she shifted in her seat and tried to think of another way to explain to the large, and basically decent, man that if he didn’t let her out of her lease ten months early that she was very much afraid that she would end up killing his cousin with her bare hands. Since she was pretty sure that a full confession would only come back and bite her in the ass later, she decided to go with a more subtle route to get out of her lease.  
  
  “I need to be released from my lease, because your cousin is an asshole and he’s making my life a living hell,” she explained in a calm and efficient manner, neglecting to mention that she’d already thought of twenty-nine different ways to kill the large, and annoying, bastard.  
  
  For a moment, Trevor didn’t say anything as he studied her from across the small eighteenth century country kitchen table that she’d inherited from her Great-Grandmother Rose. His eyes narrowed on her in an assessing manner as she did the same to him, refusing to be intimidated. When it became obvious that intimidation wasn’t going to work, he tried another tactic.  
  
  “Which cousin?” he asked, feigning ignorance as he leaned back in his chair. Jodi just barely bit back a wince when the chair creaked in protest at having to support such a large man. If she had to guess, she’d have to say the man weighed well over two hundred pounds and every last ounce of him was pure muscle. She really wasn’t sure how much more abuse her poor chair could take before it finally cracked under pressure.  
  
  It would probably depress her for a day or two to lose such a treasured item, especially since she couldn’t afford to replace it, even with a cheap knockoff from Wal-Mart on her new salary. Then again, if it meant getting out of the lease from hell and away from the most annoying man on earth then she would just have to suck it up and deal with the loss, she decided.  
  
  “You know which one,” she bit out, knowing that he knew damn well which one of his cousins was driving her to the point of no return.  
  
  “There are five of them renting apartments here,” he pointed out, not sounding happy about that fact, but not willing to make this easy on her. “I’m afraid that you’ll have to be a little more specific. ”  
  
  Granted, all of his cousins that rented here seemed to be arrogant bastards, but only one of them was a complete asshole. The rest of his cousins amused her and yes, they could annoy the hell out of her, but not to the point where she was contemplating murder. That reaction was reserved solely for one man and one man alone.  
  
  Danny Bradford.  
  
  It was actually kind of funny, because before she’d moved here, she’d thought of herself as a pacifist. Just the thought of a puppy whimpering, or accidentally hurting anyone’s feelings would have had her hitting a pint of Ben and Jerry’s and sobbing hysterically over a Lifetime movie. Before Danny Bradford she’d never gotten truly good and mad. She’d never even held a grudge before she’d met him. She usually let things go pretty quickly and didn’t waste her time on nonsense, but that all changed the day that she moved in and met the bastard living across the hall.  
  
  Then again, a lot of things had changed in her life over the last few months, and some of those things might be influencing her reaction to Danny Bradford. But, she was pretty sure that even if she hadn’t been dumped the night before her wedding, lost her job at the museum, been forced to take a job as the town librarian, and humiliated in every way imaginable by her ex, that she would still be developing an all-consuming hatred for the man living across the hall from her.  
  
  He was arrogant, cocky, a jerk, too good looking for his own good, a jerk, an asshole, really annoying and did she mention that he was a jerk? It seemed as though he lived to screw with her. It was bad enough that she had to deal with all the crap that he put her through, but that damn cocky smile of his that he wore while he did it just pissed her off in too many ways to actually count. She hated that smile, probably not as much as she hated the man, but it was a close second.  
  
  “Danny,” she bit out, glaring at the man as she silently dared him to continue sitting there pretending that he didn’t know that his cousin had been having a heck of a time making her life a living hell. He knew, oh, he knew. A week didn’t go by that she wasn’t forced to call him and explain as calmly as possible that if his cousin kept up his bullshit that she would be forced to kick him in the balls to wipe that cocky smile off his face.  
  
  Normally when she was forced to make those calls, which made her feel like a tattling child, Trevor would listen for all of ten seconds, sigh heavily and hand the phone over to Zoe, his wife and the unofficial manager of all the rental properties that they owned. Trevor usually only got involved as a last resort or if his wife was too exhausted from taking care of the couple’s children to muster up the energy to deal with tenants. Actually, she preferred to deal with Zoe, because she would listen, sympathize, and after Jodi finished getting it off her chest, the short plump woman would give her a hug, tell her to hang in there, walk across the hall and slap Danny upside his head.  
  
  Then with a satisfied sigh, Zoe would smile and go, leaving her to deal with Danny, that damn cocky grin of his, and the knowledge that she’d somehow just set down a challenge for him. Every time Zoe paid him a visit, he always upped his game to drive her insane.  
  
  Like last week when she’d been forced to complain about Danny getting her placed on another restaurant’s delivery banned list. Zoe had come right over, this time not bothering to see her first before she knocked on Danny’s door. When Danny opened the door while eating her hot wings, she’d like to point out, Zoe sighed, reached up and slapped Danny upside his head.  
  
  Instead of getting pissed like she would probably be if someone kept slapping her upside the head, Danny had simply shrugged it off and picked up another hot wing. Just as he was about to take a bite, Zoe snatched the wing and the takeout box out of his hands, scowled up at him for all of ten seconds, turned around and stormed off.  
  
  That’s when Danny finally reacted.  
  
  It was also the moment that she’d really wished she hadn’t chosen to come out of her apartment to check the mail. Before she could move to make an escape, Danny glared accusingly at her as though she’d been the one who’d stolen his, well, technically they were hers since she’d ordered them, hot wings.  
  
  He hadn’t said a word as he closed his door. He didn’t need to say anything, because that glare had said it all. She’d spent that night tossing and turning in bed, torn between apologizing to save herself from his bullshit, shrugging it off while trying to tell herself that there was nothing to worry about, and getting good and mad at herself for obsessing over something so stupid. When the alarm clock forced her to drag her butt out of bed the next morning she’d wanted to kick his ass as well as her own for wasting the entire night lying awake worrying instead of sleeping.  
  
  Thirty minutes, a lukewarm shower, and three cups of burnt coffee later, she’d still been kicking herself for her own stupidity as she’d left her apartment and mentally prepared herself for the next ten hours of dealing with meetings, committees, story time with the kids, craft hour and a book vendor event. All thoughts of the hectic day that awaited her slowly evaporated from her thoughts when she’d caught sight of the five-foot high cinderblock wall that surrounded her parking space where her car had been parked the night before.

 It was at that point that she realized that she needed to either move or find a good defense attorney. Sadly, with the current state of her finances a good defense attorney was out of the question and so was moving, she’d realized. She couldn’t afford to break her lease early and she didn’t have enough money to cover the first and last month’s rent for a new apartment.  
  
  Since she didn’t have many options available to her at the moment, she decided to try and talk her way out of her lease. Actually, she’d been hoping to have this conversation with Zoe, because she was pretty easy going and probably would have let her out of her lease without a fight. If Trevor hadn’t overheard their phone conversation an hour ago, she was pretty sure that she’d already be looking at other apartments.  
  
  Unfortunately for her, he did overhear it.  
  
  He scrubbed his hands down his face as he muttered, “I’m going to kill that fucking bastard. ”  
  
  “If you do that I’d be willing to stay,” she pointed out helpfully.  
  
  He chuckled as he leaned back in his chair and she did her best not to cringe when the chair creaked in protest, again. “I like you, Jodi. You’re never late with the rent. You keep your apartment clean and you don’t cause trouble, but I can’t let you out of your lease. ”  
  
  “Why?” she asked, her shoulders slumping in defeat.  
  
  “Because if you move out, my wife will just move another one of my asshole cousins in here,” he said with a heavy sigh.  
  
  “Well, they couldn’t be any worse than Danny. So-”  
  
  “Believe me, they are,” he said, cutting her off as he sat up, causing the chair to creak ominously with the movement. “What if I reduced your rent by a hundred bucks a month?”  
  
  “To stay?” she asked, tempted to say yes and give in.  
  
  She didn’t have much money in the bank and even though she actually did make a decent salary, she didn’t have much money at the end of the month once the bills were paid. Fifteen thousand dollars in debt had been her ex-fiancé’s parting gift for her, one that she couldn’t seem to return, and she desperately wanted to return that lovely gift. She’d been foolish when she’d agreed to open a credit card account in her name for him, and even more foolish for giving him access to her bank account, which he’d drained, legally according to the police department, mere hours before he broke the news publically to her that he couldn’t force himself to marry her.  
  
  “Two hundred?” he offered, sounding a little desperate.  
  
  “Wouldn’t it be cheaper just to let me out of my lease?” she asked, struggling with the urge to say yes and make things a little less financially tight for a while even if it meant putting up with Danny Bradford for ten more months.  
  
  “Three hundred bucks,” he said, not asked, she noted.  
  
  “Three hundred dollars?” she repeated, sure that she’d misheard him.  
  
  “Deal,” Trevor said with a firm nod as he stood up and headed for the door, leaving her sitting there struggling to figure out what just happened.  
  
  “Wait, what deal?” she asked, scrambling to get out of the chair and rush to the door and block it before he could make his escape, but sadly, her short legs just couldn’t manage it.  
  
  Trevor had the door open and was halfway down the hallway before she managed to catch up with him, well, get within ten feet of him anyway. “Wait!” she said, hoping that he’d stop long enough so that she could figure out what just happened.  
  
  With a sheepish smile, he did, but her relief was short lived as he walked towards her and then kept walking. Before she could ask him what he was doing, he was pounding on Danny’s door. Seconds later, and unfortunately before she could make it back to her apartment, Danny, wearing only jeans and looking fresh out of the shower with damp hair, a towel around his shoulders and his large muscles glistening beneath the hallway light, opened the door.  
  
  Having a really bad feeling about what was coming, Jodi took a step back, hoping to get to her apartment before-  
  
  “Ow!” Danny said, rubbing the top of his head. “What the hell was that for?” he demanded. His glare shifted away from his cousin and landed on her just as she’d reached her door and was about to sneak inside her apartment, where she planned on hiding until it was time to go to work in sixteen hours.  
  
  “Stop being an asshole,” Trevor said with a satisfied grunt before he turned around and headed for the exit only to pause and throw over his shoulder, “You still coming to dinner?”  
  
  Danny’s eyes never left her as he answered, “Yeah, what time?”  
  
  “Six,” Trevor said, continuing towards the door and leaving her to deal with his asshole cousin. “Bring dessert!”  
  
  Danny didn’t respond and Trevor didn’t wait for him to as he opened the door and stepped outside, leaving Jodi in a rather awkward position.  
  
  “Tattled on me again?” Danny asked in that deep voice that made her toes tingle.  
  
  It also reminded her of just how much she hated him.  
  
  Because of him she hadn’t gotten a wink of sleep all night. Now she was tired, cranky, admittedly bitchy, and had to work on re-writing a proposal for the library renovation that had taken her a month, in fourteen hours and without pay. All because the Town Council didn’t feel that the first proposal properly conveyed the importance of the library and its staff, meaning that she had to figure out a way to bring the budget for library renovations down by ten grand or start looking for a new job when they were forced to close the library.  
  
  “For your information,” she bit out, taking a step towards him and pretending that he didn’t have more than a foot on her as she glared up at him, “I was asking to get out of my lease. Not that it’s any of your business. ”  
  
  For some reason that seemed to amuse him, because his scowl was instantly replaced by that smug grin of his that her palm was itching to slap off his face. “Trying to run away from your feelings for me, Tink?” he asked, bringing her rage to a whole new level.  
  
  “Did…. ,” she started to say, only to force herself to take a deep breath before she did something that would involve that defense attorney that she’d already decided she couldn’t afford. “Did you just call me Tink?” she asked with barely suppressed rage.  
  
  Oblivious to how close he was to certain death, Danny merely shrugged as he grabbed the towel from around his shoulders and dried his face and chest. “Mmmhmm. ”  
  
  “That’s not my name,” she bit out, her eyes narrowing on that towel as she thought of a whole new way to get rid of the bastard.  
  
  “Well,” he said, pausing to rub the towel against the back of his head, “it really should be. ”  
  
  “It’s not,” she snapped, knowing that if he called her Tink one more time that she would-  
  
  “As much as I’d love to stand here and chat with you, Tinkerbelle, I have somewhere to be,” he said with a wink as he shut the door, leaving her standing there, seething with rage and making her wonder how she was going to get through the next ten months without killing him.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  “I’m raising your rent,” Trevor announced as he passed one of the large bowls of mashed potatoes to him.  
  
  “And why is that?” Danny asked, picking up the wooden spoon stabbed in the center of the thick white goo and scooped up a large amount. “It’s either raise your rent or let your future wife move out,” Trevor explained as he squirted ketchup on his meatloaf. At least, Danny thought it was meatloaf, but since Zoe had cooked this meal he really couldn’t be sure of anything.  
  
  “She’s not my future wife,” Danny said, sighing heavily as he placed the bowl of mashed potatoes down. “You really need to quit that shit. ”  
  
  “Then what is she?” Jason, another one of his cousins asked as he gestured towards the bowl of mashed potatoes. “Pass the scalloped potatoes. ”  
  
  Frowning, Danny looked around the table, but he didn’t see anything that even remotely resembled scalloped potatoes.  
  
  “That’s rice,” Trevor said tightly, shooting them a glare with the silent message to shut their mouths and not question the food, something that he badly wanted to do. But since it would just end in a fistfight and with answers that he probably really didn’t want, he let it go and answered his cousin.  
  
  “She’s just the woman that rents the apartment across from me and that I torment for my own entertainment when I’m bored or I’m just in the mood to piss her off,” which was every day, but he didn’t bother to point that out since it would just encourage his cousin’s bullshit.  
  
  “I see,” Jason said, sounding amused.  
  
  “I’m glad that you do,” he said, glad that this bullshit was over wi-  
  
  “She’s definitely your future wife,” Jason said, chuckling and pissing him off.  
  
  “We could have the wedding in our backyard,” Haley, Jason’s wife and a cute little thing that he wouldn’t have minded spending a little time with before his cousin corrupted her, said, looking hopeful as she pushed her glasses back up her nose.  
  
  Zoe sighed, shaking her head as she picked up the bowl of what appeared to be gravy and said, “Bradfords don’t have weddings. Weddings imply that some planning went into it and the bride was asked when what it really comes down to is a kidnapping, a terrified Justice of the Peace, a quick ceremony and a race across town to have the marriage consummated before the bride comes to her senses and gets the marriage annulled. ”  
  
  Trevor gasped in outrage. “You said that it was the most romantic night of your life!”  
  
  “Oh,” Zoe said, blinking before she added, “It was,” in a placating tone as she reached over and gave her husband’s hand a reassuring squeeze.  
  
  “Keep your lies, woman!” Trevor snapped, sounding pissed, but when Zoe sighed and tried to move her hand away, he quickly snatched it back and entwined their fingers together even as he continued to glare accusingly at her.  
  
  “Just because we didn’t have a wedding doesn’t mean that no Bradford has ever had a wedding,” Haley pointed out, picking up a bowl of…. well, Danny was at a loss at what the chunky, clear pink gunk was.  
  
  “Yes, it does, my little grasshopper,” Jason said as he took the bowl from Haley and with a discreet shake of his head, warned her away from the stuff that not even a Bradford would take a chance on.

The top is plywood with a frame made out of 1x4's, made with 45 degree miters, the dimensions ~22"" by 49"".  When the boards are that long, even small imperfections are hugely noticeable.

I gave up on using my miter saw because I just don't have the fine control over the miter angle on it, and switched to my table saw because I have a nice INCRA miter gauge.  It's not bad for the shorter pieces, but for the longer pieces I had to clamp the boards to the gauge to ensure they would move forward evenly and not end up binding in the blade.

That worked but it seems like there's got to be a better way.  I did see some videos of making a 45 degree miter sled, but I imagine even with that I would face the same hurdle of having to clamp the board to the sled to avoid binding.  If I planned on doing more boards like this, does it make more sense to buy a nicer miter saw that allows me a bit more fine angle adjustments?

Meanwhile in Tunisia... we got *what* exactly? A stack of paperwork, a coffee-stained application form, and a ministry building that hasn’t updated its website since 2009?

It just *feels* like we don’t have anything like that here. Or maybe we do, but it’s in some secret WhatsApp group you only get invited to if you survive 3 years of networking events and know someone’s cousin at the Ministry of ""Inchallah"".

Where’s *our* Erasmus? Our startup grants without 47 signatures? Something for young people, creatives, nerds, weirdos, people with dreams?

If I’m wrong and there *are* programs like that out there, please, for the love of makloub, drop some links or names. I’d love to be proven wrong and maybe even apply before I hit 40.",2,1751547912.0,Tunisia,10,1.0,False

I move some solid weights in the big movements (Squat, Bench, Deadlift) and have good relative strength (8-10 chinups, sets of 25-50 on bodyweight squats).

I can NOT get my eating under control, and I am gaining weight noticeably in the past year.

I understand counting calories and macros.  I understand ratios of protein/fat/carbs/fiber.  This isn't a lack of knowledge.

I tried intermittent fasting and quickly dropped to 190 and felt great. Then began eating normally again.

I tried apps to track macros and dropped to 190, then decided it was too hard and I'd just mentally keep track instead.

I have excellent plans, and then make a momentary decision to just make an exception... Just a little one... And then another one...  And I justify it and act on it in the moment.

""Today, I'm fasting.... But I have that 10Am meeting.  I don't want my stomach growling in the meeting.... I'll just have something small to eat.... But if I'm going to eat, I may as well eat enough to skip lunch.... And I may as well get a coffee with it to get the combo because it's cheaper.""

I also talk myself into eating because I'll worry there won't be a chance to eat later.

  
I just did this. I'm not working today.  ""I'll make coffee and use stevia.  Ooo.  Too hot.  If I use milk in it that isn't bad.  Oh. I defrosted that chicken dish.  If I just have a little protein that won't hurt anything. It's just a bit of lean protein.""

So the plan to fast today was gone by 8AM!

I'll be telling you guys everything I can remember cause allegedly there is script these guys follow. Beware if this is something similar happening to you.

So, Let's start from the start,

I'm going on with my daily stuff and I was getting calls from my ex-roommate out of nowhere.

(A short brief about this roommate: This roommate and I were pursuing the same degree, with he being senior. He was like a big brother during our days we stayed together. He was supportive in my studies and helped me with stuff. So, naturally I had a brotherly vibe from this person)

Now, whenever we used to talk, he used to create a sense of guilt that I should be earning and look into my age and stuff because I failed once in my exam. He also used to create a sense of FOMO in my mind which was unlike of him. I used to think maybe he genuinely worries about me. He also used to say I've started a business of sorts and he's thinking of leaving his Job and pursue it full time. I used to ask him what the business is, for which he would reply something vague. Thinking he might not want to tell his business plans (which was very fair) even I didnt pry much.

One day, he calls and says his business partner is coming in the city and he can arrange a meeting with him if I am interested. Naturally having full confidence on my brotherly figure I said yes. When asked about the business a little, he said we will explain everything from scratch together when the partner is here as well. I was like, okay (again I trust this guy so much). Also tells me to wear formals specifically by calling back.

He said let's meet at a certain place (It's generally coffee shop or some good place). I agreed and went to meet them. I arrived there on time. Made me wait for more than 45 minutes (Could be because they wanna play psychologically, but he said he was stuck in traffic.). Now, my ex-roommate arrives and offers me coffee and stuff and starts talking about this big shot partner of his, how he struggled so much in his life, how he managed his household by his own and stuff. Basically making him a god.

My roommate calls the partner and says we both are waiting. (I think the partner was already there and was waiting for the ego-boosting session to end.) The guy first asks me what do I do and why I want to do this business and why I would be the right person for this opportunity (Looking back, bloody me was thinking it's a legit opportunity and I was explaining myself like a fool there.)

Talks about my family to lure out my emotions

The guy then starts talking about dreams. ""What does ""my name (Let's say Mr. Fool)"" want?"", ""What does Mr. Fool desires from his life?"", ""What does Mr. Fool want to give his parents in life?"", and all those things. Basically selling me dreams. I bought those dreams. (Again, naturally cause I trust my ex-roommate so much). We talk for like 3+ hours (mind you no talks about what the business is or what the requirements are, nothing.).

After all those talks, he arrives at the end point stating a few things about the business saying things about micro-franchising, direct selling, etc. Telling me how they eliminate the need of middleman interventions and how they save all those costs and have such good products. (No details of products yet. I press them but they only let out one product ""Kent RO Purifier"") After all explaining, he says we will finalise the deal as soon as I decide and have my funds ready and when I have my funds ready he will explain the exact business they are doing. (Asked me for 4 Lakhs + expenses for a convention upcoming in Malaysia)

He leaves, my ex-roommate asks how the guy is with such big eyes. I say yeah he seems very experienced. We talk for a bit and leave as well. I'm on my way to my home and this guy calls me to say to arrange the funds as soon as possible. Take a loan, use credit cards, borrow from someone, etc. Basically telling me to fall in a debt trap. I had my investments for my future self and broke some of those for this and told him my funds are ready.

I talk to my parents about this and they instantly know that this shit is wrong. They warned me not to get into this as it is not a real business. I really wanted to do this as it seemed so life changing and so I told them I will only have to pay 1 Lakh and hence if things go wrong I will only go Malaysia for a trip and will assume i gave that 1 Lakh for the trip only. They agreed. One more thing to notice, when i told my ex-roommate that I am going to discuss with my parents about this, he was urging me to hide this from them because they won't understand the business as this business is quite New. Nonetheless, I do discuss with my parents and learn a lesson to not listen to them.

He arranges a meeting with the partner again and now this guy brings out some blank papers to explain about Rich Dad, Poor Dad, ESBI quadrants of people, etc. Then he starts talking about how laid back the work is and easy everything is to learn. He talks about direct selling and tells me about the brand ambassadors and the owners of the companies. Talks about how it is difficult to get registration in Hong Kong and still they have a private limited registered there + x number of countries. Talks about the products (whose names I have not heard ever). He said they were international products.

Then he started talking how in 5 years I will have the liberty to stop working altogether and still keep earning. Again, they are selling dreams here. We are at the end of our session and he asks me to let's proceed with the payment. He asks me what watch do I like from some options. I point out a few. Then he puts them in cart along with some other products. Then they book my flight tickets to Malaysia and event tickets as well. Obviously from my money. Total approx expenses 5 Lakhs.

Now before leaving this partner says that you might hear some bad stuff about our company and stuff and to ignore them cause those people saying stuff are not the 1% and we have to be in that 1% that achieves their dream. I was like okay. How bad can it be? Oh boy, I was so wrong. In the evening at my home, I saw that Reddit was flooded with the incidents of Qnet and how it ruined them. I was in a frenzy. Reality hit me like a boulder. I started to connect the dots and such obvious tactics that were clearly screaming that this is a scam. All because I had trust in my friend/ex-roommate. I had my eyes closed when i was being pulled into this \*\*\*\*hole.

I knew i had to rectify my mistakes. I cancelled my tickets. I thought I would get full refund as I am applying fore refund within a day but no. I got 10k less. I immediately next day itself mailed the Qnet Support for refund. Later on more research, I got to know that there are two types of products for which you need to email at different email ids. One global and one domestic. I did the same. Got vague replies. I mean, what do you expect from such scammy companies right?

Note: Refund request window for International Orders are only 7 days and for domestic is 30 days. I requested within a day, so I was safe.

Then they were asking for PAN as ID proof. I also applied for Chargeback with the credit cards I used to pay for the stuff. After like 14 days, my International Refund arrived. I felt a bit relieved but the war was not over yet. I have my flight tickets refund, I have my international order refund, but the domestic is still pending. The probability of getting refund from chargeback was also slim as per my credit card company.

Fast forward to 30 days, I open my Credit card app on phone and see there is no pending outstanding. I was so happy. Next day got call that the dispute was in my favour. Cool. All refund sorted with some loss.

I guess you have to pay for such experience and I did as well.

Loss: Event Tickets were non refundable + Flight Cancellation Charges + Refund charges for International Orders. (I swear I could have bought a nice laptop from this money)

**TLDR: Trusted my ex-roommate too much and went in with my eyes closed and got f-ed up. I hope this doesn't happen with any of you.**

If this helps even a single soul I would think writing this stuff was worth it. If this has happened with you I hope you guys can differentiate between being paranoid and being cautious in your future endeavours.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1lqozrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/1lqozrp/our_foliage_plugin_caught_fabs_eye/,Our Foliage Plugin Caught FAB’s Eye!,"Hey everyone! It's been a while since I posted, I’ve been heads-down launching our plugin on FAB and I couldn’t wait to share what’s happening. If you didn't see the earlier posts or haven't heard of our Etherion Foliage Plugin I'll give you a quick rundown on what it does and why it exists.

About two years ago, I got fed up with the fact that Unreal still doesn’t have any proper foliage interaction built-in. There are a couple of plugins out there, but none of them really give you the kind of programmable interaction you’d need for things like Helldivers-style destruction or gameplay events. 

So after countless coffee-fuelled iterations, our three-person studio finally ended up with a lightweight, super-fast system that we’re really proud of. My girlfriend and I handled most of the build during late-night dev sessions, and seeing it all come together has been surreal.

Early feedback has been unreal 😅. While submitting it to FAB, the plugin caught the attention of the admins. I had a 30-minute video call with FAB’s creator manager, who was very impressed by the plugin and asked to be kept in the loop as things progressed. 

Even more awesome: our early users have provided nothing but positive feedback, and several of our users reported great performance on their end. The response has been overwhelming in the best way, and it really validates all the late nights. (Seriously, thanks to everyone who’s tried it so far, your support means the world.)

What it does:

-Foliage Interaction: Trees, grass, etc., sway and bend when characters or vehicles pass by.
No more static environments, our system converts foliage instances to assigned blueprints so you can code it any way you like.

-Dynamic wind system: Simulate gusts, turbulence, and smooth directional changes, all without heavy performance costs. Binaural wind audio adjusts with direction and intensity.


-High performance: Core logic is in C++ for speed, with a user-friendly Blueprint interface. We use object pooling so nothing is spawning or destroying constantly. Conversions happen in 0.05ms, which means there’s virtually no performance impact.


-Expandable features: Our Lite version covers players and small objects, while the Pro version adds vehicles, weapons, particle effects, destructible foliage, grass trails, weather, and more. (Upgrading is seamless.)


Check it out:

Lite Version (FAB) – Core interactive foliage, without object pooling (only $5).
https://www.fab.com/listings/fcdb655a-8f79-4a97-994d-3c2140067604


Pro Version (FAB) – Any interactions you could need (vehicles, custom physics, etc.) and better performance, built on top of Lite.
https://www.fab.com/listings/a3f7729e-c68e-4533-9b51-2106357b2316


Thank you so much to everyone who’s tried it out already and given feedback. I’m on AEST down here in Australia, so I’ll be around to answer questions during my waking hours. If you’re already using it, share some screenshots of your projects. We love seeing what you build with it! 😊

1lqowzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1lqowzp/msc_magnifica_review/,MSC Magnifica Review,"Hello everyone, we are a mid thirties  (American) couple that did a 7 day cruise on the MSC Magnifica that started out of Naples, IT. We boarded a week ago and disembarked today. For those that are unfamiliar, this ship has passengers embarking and disembarking at various ports on the ship for the duration of the trip. This provides a variety of benefits and setbacks depending on the topic. 

What you can expect is an honest transparent review from a couple who has been on 3 cruises together from varying cruise lines.

Boarding and check-in

The boarding process was rather simple but left you wanting more in some ways. The process was rather uneventful, but it did seem like a budget version of check-in compared to other cruise experiences (royal & celebrity). There were an over abundance of staff for the amount of folks boarding the ship for check in and the overall process from walking into the terminal and walking on board was about 20 minutes. A perk of offset embarkations for sure!

Once we walked onto the ship, you are bombarded with all the usual suspects. Drink package sales, restaurant sales, etc. Overall, it was a weird boarding process as we were the only ones boarding and it felt like we booked on an empty ship. Once we cleared security, we had no idea where to go and no one was there to direct us on next steps. 

A quick note, the cruise was very prompt on all port times excluding the final day. The crowds were not able to disembark until 20 minutes after the posted time and there were a lot of stressed folks crowded and gathering near exits worried about meeting their excursions and other timetables.

Balcony Room

Once we got to our room, we unpacked into our balcony room on the 10th floor. The room was similar to a traditional cruise balcony room minus a few things. 

1. The bed was very hard and unrelenting. If we were staying more than a week, we probably would buy a topper or something. I routinely woke up with back aches requiring stretching. (Not out of shape).
2. The pillows were very thin and it is recommended to bring your own or ask for more pillows if you prefer fluffy ones.
3. The air conditioner seemed to stop working on one of the nights and it was very warm in the room. We had a technician come to the room and stated it’s hot all over and other rooms are experiencing similar issues. The temperature was 11 degrees (F) over the average. He adjusted the flow and it seemed to be better within a hour.

Food

Let me start with some information concerning my wife. She has celiac disease which requires her diet to be gluten free. 

There are a total of 4 dining options available to all of the guests. I can speak to 3 of them as a higher cruise status was required to eat at one of the restaurants.

Buffet

The buffet was available almost 24 hours a day. It closed at 02:30 daily. We used the buffet mostly for breakfast and after dinner hours. For some occasions, we saw the dinner options at the buffet were the same as the included restaurant option. 

PROS: They had fruits, yogurts, bread, and main dish options.

CONS: 
- The coffee was below average. It is a cup you would drink because it was the only  option. 
- The absolute biggest complaint: the after hours menu included zero gluten free options. They only offered packaged bread after asking 3 workers. It was definitely a friction point during this cruise. 

Main Dining Room 

PROS: The restaurant staff was an absolute highlight. (Shoutout to Rayzon, Edwin, and Felix) They were absolutely courteous and welcoming. The lead waiter worked with my wife directly for her gluten allergy and ensured it came out of the gluten free kitchen. 

CONS: We had lunch on the last day with different staff members, and my wife ordered the GF soup. It was later discovered they gave her the wrong soup and there was a scare that she was gluten’d. She is not expecting any typical symptoms yet as this happened today.

The food overall and by and large was subpar (both menus). This was certainly a frustrating point for us expecting fresh ingredients and food options from the Mediterranean region. There were only a couple of dishes that we would say were good. Furthermore, the only coffee they had available was instant coffee. This was even a conversation point with other guests who asked us our thoughts. 

Oriental restaurant

The signs stated it was going to be renovated to a different type of restaurant at the end of the year. We were late to a dinner, and decided to check out this restaurant. The glaring initial indicator is we were the only ones in the restaurant. We love Asian cuisines and wanted to try it out. We are familiar what to avoid due to gluten such as soy sauces, eel glazes, etc. When we asked the staff, they were unaware and uncertain and it created a ton of confusion. One of the cooks came out and stated a few things have gluten that normally do not (sushi rice for instance). We reached a point of unease with the restaurant and just left to go to the main restaurant.

Amenities and Entertainment 

We attended a few shows and we were pleased by 2 of the 3. The “live from…” and movie musicals shows were quite good and would recommend them. The Lady Gaga show on the other hand… perhaps find something else to do.

We spent quite a bit of time in the card room . There isn’t much of a selection other than traditional playing cards and a couple of 500 piece puzzles. Other ships have had dominos, checkers, chess, etc. 

The pool area was an appropriate size for the ship, but the outdoor pool itself didn’t have enough space and often felt way overcrowded.

Outdoor seating

During the day it was very hard if not impossible to find anywhere to sit around the pool areas. 

But most upsetting of all was that the crew put away all of the outdoor folding chairs and closed the pools/hot tubs by 8:30pm every night. This is very early during the summer months when you may enjoy an evening seat on the cooling deck. Or a hot-tub soak after a busy day of excursions. This was very disappointing each night and compared to some of the other ships we have been on.

We had a total of 6 spa treatments ranging from Deep Tissue massage, Bali massage, facials, hair treatments, and manicure. The spa staff was exceedingly polite and would recommend their treatments again! They had a sale pop up on the 5th day that we wished we had been offered at the start of the trip. Definitely suggest waiting g till you’re on board to pay and book spa treatments as they run deals daily. After each treatment, they tried to sell their brand of products. This is pretty usual compared to the other ships.

Conclusion

Overall, we would consider this to be a below average experience for cruise riding. There were many conversations with other cruise passengers and even staff from 3 different sections (not naming to protect identities) that they couldn’t wait to have their contract end or get a contract with another cruise line. It seems that this review is in line with other cruises and even some staff.

We spent a good amount of money to travel to Italy and enjoy this vacation. We walk away happy that we got to spend some quality time, but we felt our money could have been better spent elsewhere. MSC leaves a “budget friendly” taste in our mouth and would rank this option ahead of carnival but nowhere near a luxury or premium cruise line brand. If you just want a wallet-friendly way to hop Mediterranean ports and can overlook some rough edges, MSC could work.

I've been trying to remember the name of this story-based fashion/life sim game I played on PC in the early 2010s. It was a downloadable game with a free demo, and had a 2D art style. I remember a lot of specific details, and I hope someone here might recognize it:

# What I remember:

*  You play as a girl working as an intern/assistant at a fashion company. In the beginning, there’s a scene where she brings her boss coffee. I remember this happening right before a fashion show.
* The boss is mean or dismissive, which leads the girl to quit and start her own fashion business.
* She has her own apartment you can go back to.
*  You could feed her a specific sandwich when she was hungry I remember this animation happening often and specific crunch sound i loved listening to.
* There was a café in the game, and the background music would change depending on the time of day (day vs night). It was really ambient music and the cafe had a warm tone to it.
* I An elder owned a tailor shop and there was a mannequin you would do a mini quest with to design the clothes. (or something along those lines)
* I remember playing the demo and needed to download to continue with the game but i never was allowed to download it.

I've been searching and can't find anything that exactly matches. I’d really appreciate any help, this game has been stuck in my memory for years!",1,1751547411.0,tipofmyjoystick,0,1.0,False
1lqowdc,https://i.redd.it/bz3mhcmgpnaf1.jpeg,Always stash some extra clothing in your vehicle...,"Good morning! Most of us vividly remember our first vehicle. We were probably teenagers, and while the car or truck may not have been brand new, it was still our prized chariot. It represented freedom—a symbol of our newfound status as mature young adults. And, of course, it meant we would outfit it with all the essentials for life on the road.

One of my granddaughters recently showed me her “new-to-her” car—a slate-blue beauty that she was rightfully proud of. Upon seeing the empty trunk, I casually asked if she’d stocked it with any of the usual car stuff yet: snow brush, ice scraper... the basics. She hadn’t. But luckily, I had spares.

My trunk is stocked with everything a human might conceivably need if they find themselves caught in a blizzard, stranded in a desolate forest, or stuck in a snow drift. And, as I pointed out to my granddaughter, I always carry extra clothing. After all, you never know what the day might bring. The weather might get cold, your socks might get wet, or you could fall victim to a good old-fashioned wardrobe malfunction.

My years working in boatyards taught me that lesson well. I was usually the only woman on site, and a clothing mishap would’ve been the topic at coffee breaks for many years to come. I wore only my worst clothes— no use wearing anything you didn’t want splattered with paint, smeared with caulking, caked with dirt and grease… or torn.

And tear they did. Some of the worst ones came at the most inopportune moments. Once, while walking through the shop, the side seam of my jeans caught on a nail and the seam tore open from the top of my hip to the bottom of my knee.  Oh, dear. Then there was the time my jean's back pocket got snagged, and that ripped open the entire back side of those dungarees. Not good. But fortunately, due to keeping spare clothing in my truck, I was able to make a discreet quick-change before anyone noticed. If I hadn’t, I’d probably still be the subject of boatyard lore.

These may not be the typical words of wisdom grandmothers pass on, but after hearing the story, my granddaughter gave a thoughtful nod and said yes—she’d definitely be adding some emergency clothes to her trunk.

Just in case.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! 🌞 ",1,1751547393.0,u_Read_an_ice_age_saga,0,1.0,False

They were banned in many social places like coffee shops because of concern they could be surreptitiously used for surveillance, recording others, and would make customers feel uncomfortable as a result. Using a phone requires having the lens pointed at your subject and easier to be identified as engaging in potentially undesirable behavior. 

Meta's glasses take that concept quite a bit further further. Other companies are coming out with smart glasses, such as Google with Warby Parker. I'm assuming this may be inevitable at some point, but right now there is substantial concern about privacy and where big data warehousing is going. Using another interesting scenario, how would you feel about someone using them who is invited to your home? How about in general looking at someone who is wearing them knowing that they may be analyzing you?

I'm curious to hear some public opinion about how people feel about them across the spectrum of geography, age, gender, etc. taken in this very unscientific method of discussion. ",5,1751547246.0,glasses,8,0.86,False

A lot of people have messaged me asking me to share resources that I use for my clients during productivity coaching sessions, so I figured I’d just share some here! Let me know if you have any questions.


Start Smaller Than You Think

Most systems fail because they’re too ambitious upfront. You design for your best day, not your average one and definitely not your worst. The key to building consistency is making the floor low, not the ceiling high. If your goal is to write, your daily minimum might just be opening the document and writing one sentence. If it’s working out, it could be putting on gym clothes and doing one set. Momentum is built by keeping the streak alive and not by maxing out effort. Think of it like brushing your teeth. You don’t do it because it’s inspiring. You do it because it’s automatic and small.


Link It to a Trigger

ADHD brains don’t do “free recall” well. Waiting until you remember to do something means it probably won’t happen. Instead, anchor your new task to something you already do without thinking. This is called “habit stacking” or “anchoring.” For example: After making coffee do 5 pushups.
After brushing your teeth write 1 line in your journal. After opening your laptop check your calendar. You’re not trying to remember the habit, you’re just trying to set up a reliable cue that makes it happen almost reflexively like brushing your teeth.


Track the Streak

You don’t need some fancy habit tracker. In fact, a lot of people with ADHD burn out on them. But having some visual of progress helps reinforce the pattern. It could be a paper calendar you cross off, a whiteboard tally, a simple phone note with checkmarks. The goal is not to be perfect, but rather to reinforce a sense of identity. That you do this thing. If tracking starts to become stressful, drop it. The habit matters more than the visual.


Make It Non-Negotiable

The decision to do the habit should not happen in the moment. It should be made ahead of time. If you have to re-decide every day, you’ll burn out fast. Instead, make the habit part of your identity. So decide that you don’t miss workouts. Decide you write one sentence a day, no matter what, even on bad days. Precommit to the system so there’s no emotional debate. Over time, this builds trust in yourself, which fuels consistency more than any app ever will.


Have a Fallback Plan

Life will absolutely get in the way. The trick is to define your fallback version in advance. Ask yourself what is the minimum version you can still do if everything goes wrong? Instead of 30 minutes of reading, you can read one paragraph. Instead of a full workout, you can stretch for 2 minutes. Instead of journaling, write one word. When fallback mode is pre-planned, you won’t need to think when you’re drained. You’ll just run the “low-energy protocol” and still protect the streak.


Review & Rebuild Weekly

No system stays perfect forever. What worked when you were excited might fall apart once stress hits. That’s normal. Your system should be treated like software and you should update it regularly. Pick one time per week and ask: What’s working? What’s not? What needs to be removed, simplified, or swapped? You’re not failing if it stops working. You’re only failing if you stop rebuilding. The best systems are flexible, boring, and built for real life and not just perfect days where you want to do a million things.

1lqorc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1lqorc1/eight_months_into_my_saas_startup_im_starting_to/,Eight Months into My SAAS Startup: I'm Starting to Doubt 'Build in Public',"Eight months into my SAAS startup journey, and I'm starting to question the whole ""build in public"" gospel that everyone's been preaching.

Don't get me wrong - I bought into it completely at first. Set up accounts on Xiaohongshu, WeChat, Twitter, even started documenting my entire startup journey on social media. The advice seemed sound: share your process, get feedback early, build a community around your product.

But here's what actually happened.

The people who showed up weren't customers - they were fellow entrepreneurs, tool collectors, and startup voyeurs. Every post attracted the same crowd: developers looking for free access, wannabe founders seeking validation for their own ideas, and yes, even competitors doing reconnaissance.

When you're building features in public, you're not getting feedback from people who will actually pay for your product. You're getting commentary from professional early adopters whose primary interest is getting free access to new tools. And here's the kicker - you can't tell if their enthusiasm comes from genuine need or just the thrill of trying something new for free.

The conversations I had in these communities were frustrating. People wanted to discuss grand visions and market theories, not the specific pain points my product was trying to solve. They'd suggest features that sounded impressive but had zero correlation with what paying customers actually needed. It was all intellectual masturbation disguised as user research.

I started lurking in other startup communities to see if this was just me. Nope - same pattern everywhere. The active participants were mostly developers, aspiring entrepreneurs, and what I call ""professional beta testers"" - people who collect access to new tools like Pokemon cards but never become paying customers.

This realization hit me hard: the people most vocal in public startup spaces are often the least representative of your actual market.

If you're building for mainstream users - not just the tech-savvy early adopter crowd - then optimizing for Product Hunt launches and viral startup Twitter threads might be counterproductive. You're essentially training your product development process on feedback from people who will never pay you.

Take my AI application, for example. I want to reach everyday professionals, not just AI enthusiasts. But guess who dominates the conversation when I share updates? AI nerds who want to debate model architectures, not busy marketing managers who just need their content creation workflow to be 10% faster.

The harsh truth is that building in public often creates an echo chamber. You end up in conversations with other founders who are also trying to build in public, creating this weird meta-community where everyone's performing entrepreneurship rather than actually serving customers.

Here's what I learned: early feedback from public communities is often noise, not signal. Real customers are usually too busy with their actual jobs to hang out in startup communities giving free consulting to entrepreneurs.

The people willing to engage with your public building process fall into predictable categories: competitors doing market research, developers exploring side projects, startup tourists, and investors who may or may not have real money to deploy. None of these groups have the same urgency and constraints as your actual target customers.

I'm not saying build in public is completely useless. For certain types of products - especially developer tools or products specifically targeting the startup community - it can work. But if you're building for mainstream markets, you might be optimizing for the wrong audience entirely.

The real question isn't whether building in public helps you find users - it's whether it helps you find the right users. And after eight months of trying, I'm increasingly convinced that for most products, the answer is no.

Maybe it's time to admit that the best customer research happens in boring places like industry forums, LinkedIn groups, and coffee shops with actual target users - not in the glamorous world of startup Twitter and entrepreneur TikTok.

Sometimes the most valuable feedback comes from people who will never engage with your public content but will quietly hand over their credit card if you solve their problem well enough.

That's a lesson I wish someone had told me eight months ago.

My current strategy is a mix of cold approaches, speed dating, Hinge, and attending social events or places (church, gym, run club, work if possible, other sports, coffee shops, Trader Joes/Costco, friends, warm messaging on Instagram). Cold approaches will go like this: 

1. Eye contact/body language + approach

2. Make small talk for 1-2 minutes or so about the area around us, etc.

3. Be forward and tell her I saw her and thought she was attractive, ask for her number

4. If I get number, schedule a date

My goal is 100 approaches for the rest of the year. I figure if I am a shooter I will shoot, the worst that can happen is she says no thanks. I figure I will get a 3% success rate with cold approaches.

Let me know if you have any questions.


Start Smaller Than You Think

Most systems fail because they’re too ambitious upfront. You design for your best day, not your average one and definitely not your worst. The key to building consistency is making the floor low, not the ceiling high. If your goal is to write, your daily minimum might just be opening the document and writing one sentence. If it’s working out, it could be putting on gym clothes and doing one set. Momentum is built by keeping the streak alive and not by maxing out effort. Think of it like brushing your teeth. You don’t do it because it’s inspiring. You do it because it’s automatic and small.


Link It to a Trigger

ADHD brains don’t do “free recall” well. Waiting until you remember to do something means it probably won’t happen. Instead, anchor your new task to something you already do without thinking. This is called “habit stacking” or “anchoring.” For example: After making coffee do 5 pushups.
After brushing your teeth write 1 line in your journal. After opening your laptop check your calendar. You’re not trying to remember the habit, you’re just trying to set up a reliable cue that makes it happen almost reflexively like brushing your teeth.


Track the Streak

You don’t need some fancy habit tracker. In fact, a lot of people with ADHD burn out on them. But having some visual of progress helps reinforce the pattern. It could be a paper calendar you cross off, a whiteboard tally, a simple phone note with checkmarks. The goal is not to be perfect, but rather to reinforce a sense of identity. That you do this thing. If tracking starts to become stressful, drop it. The habit matters more than the visual.


Make It Non-Negotiable

The decision to do the habit should not happen in the moment. It should be made ahead of time. If you have to re-decide every day, you’ll burn out fast. Instead, make the habit part of your identity. So decide that you don’t miss workouts. Decide you write one sentence a day, no matter what, even on bad days. Precommit to the system so there’s no emotional debate. Over time, this builds trust in yourself, which fuels consistency more than any app ever will.


Have a Fallback Plan

Life will absolutely get in the way. The trick is to define your fallback version in advance. Ask yourself what is the minimum version you can still do if everything goes wrong? Instead of 30 minutes of reading, you can read one paragraph. Instead of a full workout, you can stretch for 2 minutes. Instead of journaling, write one word. When fallback mode is pre-planned, you won’t need to think when you’re drained. You’ll just run the “low-energy protocol” and still protect the streak.


Review & Rebuild Weekly

No system stays perfect forever. What worked when you were excited might fall apart once stress hits. That’s normal. Your system should be treated like software and you should update it regularly. Pick one time per week and ask: What’s working? What’s not? What needs to be removed, simplified, or swapped? You’re not failing if it stops working. You’re only failing if you stop rebuilding. The best systems are flexible, boring, and built for real life and not just perfect days where you want to do a million things.

I worked for a giant Fortune 500 Semiconductor company (the client) from 2001 - 2024 as a contractor, employed through a third party company. 

I worked in the client's building, using their laptops and equipment the whole time. Travel was expensed to them. Phone usage was expensed to them.

Within the first few years, they did institute a policy to separate their employees from working with us in the same cubicle areas and doing the same jobs. You were only supposed to interact with the client who was the lead for that particular project. 

The general rule is you got one year employed there, then had to take at least six months off before you could come back. Occasionally, they would grant up to a six month extension. The client's internal rules said that if a role was to last more than 12 months, they should petition Corporate for a headcount increase. This never happened.

Within my first year, they started ""insourcing"" where we were no longer locked to the 12 month rule. But we had a manager from our company onsite at all times and most all interaction with the client was to be done through them. 

Over time, the rules got a lot more relaxed. I moved up to a low-level manager role and found that the client wouldn't allow us to increase our rates for cost of living for well over a decade. One year the client made all vendors take a 25% reduction across the board, so we all got pay cuts. 

Eventually, at least on my team, there were only four of us left after rounds and rounds of layoffs and moving our contracts to an offshore vendor, etc. in 2015. We all continued on, very rarely talking to our company's local manager and interacting with the client and other vendors 1:1 all the time. Until finally they let me go days before New Year, 2025. 

My ex-wife was a recruiter and her former boss, unbeknownst to me, worked for the same company I did, at the time. When my ex-wife brought up where I worked, she noted that she helped draft the original ""insourcing"" contract and told her that it was ""Illegal as hell"" from a co-employment stance. 

So I literally went from 2002 to 2025 NON-STOP as a contractor there. Using their equipment, with my own cubicle for most of it, interacting with their employees at every level on a daily basis. 

So I have to question, even with the ""insourcing"" contract, isn't this a violation of co-employment law? It's not as egregious as the Microsoft case from years back, but I was basically treated as an employee when needed. My client contact would put me in his out of office as the only contact when he was on vacation. 

I did get insurance through my company and they offered a non-matching 401k but that was about it. The client offered stock options and other perks. Free coffee for employees and visitors, but not contractors. A few even got fired for taking the free coffee.

Clearly the role continued for longer than 12 months and they never followed their own rules to petition for permanent headcount. In fact, my role is still more or less there. There is one person left on my team. The laid him off too, but had another company hire him to do the same role. 

While I am grateful for the employment all of these years, and the experience and perks it did bring, it has been tough to be a contractor the whole time, always feeling like you could be let go at any minute. I don't get the prestige of having the client's name on my resume. I didn't get stock options. I didn't get paid sabbaticals like they did. I didn't get the unemployment perks they did (they pay you to look for another internal job for several weeks). 

So is this a co-employment violation, even with the ""insourcing"" contract? I don't think those were meant to be used for 20+ year streaks. Would it be worth pursuing a lawsuit against them for it?",1,1751546407.0,legaladvice,1,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The beauty and durability of petrified wood tables stem from their unique composition and the processes that create them. Here’s a closer look at the key features that define these captivating pieces of furniture.

**Material Composition**

petrified wood is essentially fossilized wood, where the organic material has been replaced by minerals such as silica, calcite, pyrite, and others. The petrification process occurs when wood is buried in sediment and exposed to mineral-rich water. Over vast spans of time, the minerals gradually replace the wood's original structure, preserving its form and sometimes even its cellular details.

The resulting material is incredibly hard and durable, resembling stone while retaining the appearance of wood grain. This unique conversion imbues each piece with its individual colors, patterns, and textures, making no two petrified wood tables exactly alike.The mineral composition also contributes to the table's resistance to weathering, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor use.

**Tabletop Dimensions and Shape**

Petrified wood table tops come in a variety of dimensions and shapes, largely dictated by the original size and form of the petrified log or section used in its creation. dimensions can range from small side tables to large dining or conference tables, typically varying from 18 inches to over 10 feet in length. The thickness of the tabletop also varies, usually ranging from 2 to 6 inches.

Shapes can be highly irregular, following the natural contours of the wood, or they can be cut and polished into more conventional shapes like circles, squares, or rectangles. The edges of the tabletop may be left in their natural state or carefully smoothed and finished.Choosing the right dimensions and shape depends on the intended use and the desired aesthetic.

**Base Construction and Materials**

the base of a petrified wood table plays a crucial role in both its stability and overall aesthetic. Common base materials include steel, wood, and stone, each offering a different look and feel. Steel bases are often chosen for their strength and modern appearance, with options ranging from brushed stainless steel to powder-coated finishes in various colors.Wood bases can complement the natural look of the petrified wood tabletop, creating a cohesive and organic design. Stone bases offer a sense of grounding and permanence, further emphasizing the table’s connection to the earth.The design of the base can be simple and minimalist or more elaborate and sculptural, depending on the desired style.

**Finish and Polishing**

The finish applied to the petrified wood tabletop plays a notable role in enhancing its beauty and protecting it from the elements. Common finishes include sealants,waxes,and polishes,each offering different levels of protection and sheen. Sealants help to prevent moisture penetration,while waxes add a layer of protection and enhance the natural colors and patterns of the wood.

Polishing helps to create a smooth, glossy surface that highlights the intricate details of the petrified wood. The level of polishing can range from a matte finish to a high-gloss shine, depending on the desired look. The choice of finish should consider both aesthetic preferences and the table’s intended use,as some finishes are more durable and resistant to scratches than others.

## Core Benefits

petrified wood tables offer a range of practical and aesthetic benefits that make them a desirable addition to any space. here are some of the key advantages these unique tables provide.

**Enhance Aesthetic Appeal:** petrified wood tables serve as stunning focal points, adding a touch of natural history and timeless elegance to any room. Their unique patterns, colors, and textures bring an organic and sophisticated feel to interior spaces, and their visual appeal makes them excellent conversation starters.

For example, a petrified wood coffee table with a striking reddish-brown hue and intricate wood grain can transform a living room, adding character and warmth.The natural beauty of the stone contrasts beautifully with modern décor, creating a captivating visual statement.

**Increase Durability & Longevity:** due to their mineral composition, petrified wood tables are incredibly durable and resistant to wear and tear. Unlike traditional wood tables, they are impervious to rot, insects, and moisture, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor use.

this means that a petrified wood dining table can withstand the rigors of daily use without showing signs of wear, ensuring that it remains a cherished heirloom for generations.Their resistance to environmental factors also makes them ideal for outdoor patios or gardens, where they can withstand sun, rain, and temperature fluctuations without deteriorating.

**Promote Uniqueness:** Each petrified wood table is a one-of-a-kind piece, ensuring that no two tables are exactly alike. The unique patterns, colors, and textures of each slab of petrified wood are dictated by the original tree and the specific minerals involved in the petrification process.

this individuality means that owning a petrified wood table allows you to showcase a truly unique piece of natural history in your home. For example,a petrified wood side table with a distinctive blue-green hue and unusual mineral inclusions will stand out as a testament to nature's artistry,making it a prized possession.

## FAQs Section

Many customers have concerns when buying something remarkable as a Petrified Wood table. The following questions help to ease some reservations about making such a unique purchase.

**Are petrified wood tables prone to cracking or damage?**
While petrified wood is incredibly durable, it is still a natural material and can be susceptible to cracking or chipping if subjected to extreme force or impact. Though, with proper care and handling, petrified wood tables can last for generations without significant damage. It's important to avoid dropping heavy objects on the tabletop or exposing it to sudden temperature changes, which can cause stress fractures.

**How do I properly care for and maintain a petrified wood table?**
Caring for a petrified wood table is relatively simple.Regular dusting with a soft cloth is usually sufficient to keep the surface clean. For deeper cleaning, you can use a mild soap and water solution, followed by a thorough drying. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the finish or the petrified wood itself. Applying a protective sealant or wax periodically can also help to maintain its beauty and prevent moisture damage.

**Can petrified wood tables be used outdoors?**
Yes, petrified wood tables are generally suitable for outdoor use, as they are resistant to moisture, insects, and rot. However, it's important to choose a table with a suitable finish that can withstand the elements. If you live in an area with extreme weather conditions, it's advisable to cover or store the table indoors during the harshest months to prevent potential damage.

## competitor Comparison

Petrified wood tables offer a unique combination of history and artistry, but how do they stack up against other high-end table options? Let's compare them with two popular alternatives.

### Product Comparison Overview

#### Petrified Wood Table

*   **Material:** Fossilized wood, replaced by minerals
*   **aesthetic:** Natural, unique, and timeless
*   **Durability:** Highly resistant to wear, rot, and insects
*   **Maintenance:** Relatively low, requires occasional cleaning and sealing

#### Marble Table

*   **Material:** Natural stone (metamorphic rock)
*   **Aesthetic:** Elegant, formal, and luxurious
*   **Durability:** Durable but can be prone to staining and scratching
*   **Maintenance:** Requires regular sealing and gentle cleaning

#### Live Edge Wood Table

*   **Material:** Natural wood slab with untouched edges
*   **Aesthetic:** Rustic, organic, and contemporary
*   **Durability:** Varies depending on the wood species, susceptible to moisture and wear
*   **Maintenance:** Requires regular oiling and sealing to prevent warping and cracking

### Key Differences Summary

Petrified wood tables stand out for their exceptional durability and unique, history-infused aesthetic. Compared to marble,they require less maintenance and are more resistant to outdoor elements. While live edge wood tables offer a similar organic feel, they lack the longevity and resistance to wear and tear that petrified wood provides. For customers seeking a statement piece that combines beauty, durability, and a touch of the ancient world, petrified wood tables offer unparalleled value.

1lqohjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/1lqohjm/leftover_cardamom_syrup_grounds/,Leftover Cardamom Syrup Grounds,"I made cardamom syrup using ground cardamon.

The leftover grounds still contain some syrup, and have a consistency like the coffee left in the french press after a brew. I assume it's fine to use as normal but I'm not sure how sugar and water will affect the recipe. Also because it's sticky, I don't want to end up with lumpy or gritty texture.

I'm not a fan of throwing food away, but I am a fan of cardamom. Does it work in apple crumble or peach cobbler? Is it fine in a regular waffle recipe? I'm also considering to just use it in my overnight oats and chia seed puddings.

Should be refrigerated because of the water?

For reference:
1 cup water 
1 cup sugar (half muscavado, half brown sugar) almost ¼ cup ground cardamom. 
Stirred until it started to simmer, left on the counter overnight with a cover to let it steep as much as possible. Strained the next morning.

There is a 30 year age gap. But I never really know if he is into me as he often plays it very cool. I also have never been involved with an older man before and their communication styles are just so different from the men that I am used to that are my age. He is very intelligent and loves very stimulating conversations which we often have. We do flirt quite a lot and have had lots of conversations before about naughty stuff (often him being curious more than anything) and I’ve always just thought maybe it was a bit of banter. He has commented on my appearance before and thinks I’m attractive. But I want to know if he likes me in a romantic way and possibly not just a physical. I was even more confused before because I’ve liked him for quite a long time and he would always almost remain quite guarded (probs cos of the age gap maybe) but within the last 3 months, he has seemed a lot more engaged with me. Not sure if it’s because I moved closer to his area for work I don’t know. But he’s been very active on my social media.. liking or commenting on my Facebook posts, messaging me.. we even met up about 2 weeks ago and he bought me a birthday card which I was not expecting. It was a sweet card too. He also initiated this meeting for us to go for a coffee. He keeps sending me reels on Facebook to start conversations.. we worked in the same sector and he will often send me things to help with my job. The other night he told me ‘you are perfect as you are’. Then we were talking about fishing the other day and I was getting advice from him on one of the rivers near where we live and he randomly said ‘let me know if you go, I’ll come and see you’ which I wasn’t expecting. But then sometimes I’ll make sweet comments or just simply reply to a message and he won’t reply 🤷🏻‍♀️ and he made a weird comment when we were sat in the cafe together when we met. I made a joke and said ‘I think people think we are married’. He said ‘No they probably think you are my granddaughter’. Bit of a weird thing to say to a woman who you’ve had certain conversations with and you’re making plans to meet up with quite a lot. Does this guy like me or not? His communication is just not something I’m used to and I am often confused by his actions. Guys my own age will just tell you they wanna sleep with you and where to meet. But I’m not into all of that so never get anywhere with guys my own age. I’m kinda done with them. But this guy seems like he’s taking his time maybe? Or does he just not like me that way?

I thought I'd take a moment to explain how AA works.  I'm not the only member of Secular AA for whom ""Probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism"" doesn't have the ring of a very good explanation. Of course, if you like that sort of thing, feel free to read a different post.  If you already have Coke Classic, Pepsi One will likely not appeal to you.

The original ""How it Works"" famously includes the written twelve steps, but if the written twelve steps were how it worked, SMART Recovery and LifeRing wouldn't work, let alone r/stopdrinking, which for some works quite well.  The twelve steps aren't even the original Oxford Group six steps that Bill took to get sober.  He just added some filler. 

It's probably ungenerous to say he lied. Let's just say he ""branded"".  Like I said, Coke Classic.

My take on how it works begins with this idea:  people, like other primates, need a social group to survive, thrive and feel happy.  Along these lines, let me tell you about our television.

Some of the features of our little Roku device that my wife really likes are the free animal channels we get.  Bugs.  Fish.  Dolphins are a treat.  But the other day we got lucky and hit the jackpot -- Mountain gorillas, creatures very much like us in many ways.

We watched one poor schlub, a young adult male, who tried to join a new group of gorillas.  Not only did he not become the alpha male, a job that some other gorilla was successfully enjoying, he ended up with the lowest status in the whole group, ranking somewhere below the females and the children.  Last in line for everything.

In an effort to improve his status, he came fairly close to being killed when some other adult males attacked the tribe, and he loyally defended the group.  The alpha male, meantime, was safely hanging out, eating dead wood and getting laid.  Living the mountain gorilla dream.  Nobody was impressed by the young schlub's bravery, so he bet big on improving his status, and lost.

How AA works is that, maybe not always, but often enough, we act slightly better than mountain gorillas.  It's one alcoholic helping another, and being a friend to the newcomer trying to come in and join the group and stop drinking.  In my case it was a guy named Phil on my first day, who shook my hand, offered me coffee, and took the time to explain in simple terms how to get sober.  We don't quit forever, we just quit a day at a time, or five minutes at a time if you have to.  And go to meetings. When you listen at the meeting, try to identify with the feelings, don't compare with the stories.

Basic newcomer stuff.

Sometimes you'll go to a mountain gorilla style group, where the alpha males will sit around and thump their ~~Big Books~~ chests, or complain you're not sharing ""correctly"", and tell you in plenty of other ways that you're the low man on the totem pole, at best.  

Some of them read the branded version of How It Works.

Some of them are secular, too.  Traditional AA doesn't have a monopoly on meetings that suck.

Hopefully, as a human, you have an Internet connection that can be pointed at any zoom meeting, and maybe a car or money for the bus!   Hooray!  You can vote with your feet.

Go find a meeting where someone -- maybe someone named Phil -- will greet you at the door and offer you coffee and friendship.  ",5,1751545716.0,AASecular,1,1.0,False

I’m 24 and have been with my boyfriend, 27, for just under a year. We usually have a good relationship. He’s funny and caring, and when he’s in a good mood, he’s the sweetest person. But lately he’s been distant and stressed, which I understand because of work.

The other night we were watching a movie at his place and he got up to go to the kitchen, leaving his phone on the coffee table. The screen lit up and I caught a glimpse of a notification from someone saved as “S.” with a little sparkle emoji. It disappeared quickly. He never uses emojis in contact names and doesn’t usually get messages that late.

I felt uneasy and after thinking about it for a bit, I picked up his phone to try to see the name again. I didn’t unlock anything or go through his messages, I just pulled down the notifications screen.

Right then he came back, snatched the phone out of my hand, and his face changed. He didn’t yell at first, but he was cold and tense. Then he started saying things like “How dare you go through my phone,” “I can’t believe you don’t trust me,” and “You’re acting like a jealous crazy girl.” He kept repeating that I ruined the night and that I was crossing a huge line.

When I tried to explain I wasn’t trying to spy, I was just worried, he snapped and said I was “manipulative” and told me to leave his place immediately.

I was shocked and hurt, but I keep telling myself he’s just upset and stressed. I want to believe he’s not hiding anything and that I’m the one who made a mistake. Now he’s barely talking to me and said he needs space.

I know I shouldn’t have touched his phone, but was I really the asshole here?


ETA
Thanks so much to everyone who replied and shared their thoughts I really appreciate it even if some of it is hard to hear

I tried to reach out to him today just to make sure he wasn’t too upset and to clear the air He replied but was really short and said he needed space which I get

He’s usually the one who texts first and checks in a lot but lately he’s been kind of distant and moody I know he’s been under a lot of stress from work but sometimes he gets way too intense over little things Like a few days ago he got mad because I asked if he wanted to eat and told me I was annoying Then he ignored me for hours before apologizing and saying he was just overwhelmed

I’m still trying to figure out what’s normal and what isn’t I want to believe he’s not all bad but sometimes I wonder if I’m just making excuses for him

Thanks again for all the advice and support

Edit 2

Thank you again to everyone who commented I’ve been reading through all of it even the ones that are hard to hear

Some people said I was in the wrong and I do understand that too I know I shouldn’t have touched his phone and I’m really not trying to play the victim I just didn’t expect it to blow up like this

He actually texted me just now and said “Hope you’ve calmed down and had time to reflect I’ll reach out when I feel ready”

It seemed kind of cold but I guess he just needs space. I do think he’s abit excessive with his reactions sometimes I just don’t like upsetting anyone but he seems to be acting worse lately and I don’t like that. I think I need to have a talk with him about the way he’s treating me ",38,1751545667.0,AITAH,175,0.76,False
1lqo9t9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1lqo9t9/i_barely_got_to_sit_down_on_my_own_burthday_and/,"I barely got to sit down on my own burthday, and I'm so annoyed","Yeah, me and my twin brother just had our twenty first birthday. I was so fucking excited for the first couple of weeks leading up to the party because I knew I was going to have a blast. I almost never get to just let loose, see all my friends at once, and get drunk, so I really wanted things to go well. I bought a bunch of alcohol, got all of my friends to request the weekend off, and picked the perfect camping spot: a dusty lot way in the back of the park that had no other nearby bookings. It was pretty inconvenient to get to, but I was happy because there were barely any people for about half a mile around, so I wouldn't have to worry about noise complaints. 

My plans derailed immediately. I wanted to leave in the afternoon so we could get to the park right at check in. I had a loose schedule that involved picking up the friend I was driving with, grabbing ice, and loading the cars. The pickup went okay. I went to grab my friend, and my brother went to grab his girlfriend. My brother also told me that he had to go to the store really quick because his girlfriend forgot something. I waited around for him and partially loaded my car, but I couldn't do much since I needed to make space for the cooler. Also, I had to do all of the loading myself because my friend had a broken arm and was just there for moral support. 

Thirty minutes go by, and my brother hasn't even left the shopping center he's in. My friends were already loading up their cars and asking for updates, so I called him and asked him what he was doing. Motherfucker was at a café. He was getting coffee for just him and his girlfriend even though he knew he had to be the first to leave because *he had the reservation.* I straight up couldn't leave without him. Whatever, I decided to just get the ice by myself even though I told him I wanted help with that because it was over a shopping cart full of ice. That shit was heavy, and loading it into the coolers was a pain in the ass. My arms were simultaneously numb and on fire (I wore a tank top like a dumbass). 

By the time I got back, my brother was loading his car. The dude literally just fucked off for over an hour and didn't even apologize. Cool, we got all packed up. We get in our cars. I load up my music, and then my brother texts me asking me if he should grab a second bottle of tequila for some reason. No clue why he didn't just pack it beforehand. I flipped him off through my car window as per usual and said yes. Finally, we got on the road. It was a solid half hour after I wanted to get to the campground in the first place, but I guess it's fine.

The drive was stressful as fuck. I was driving my dad's SUV instead of my little sedan, and the car was super heavy. Sure, I had practiced the route a bit in my dad's car beforehand, but I already knew I was going to have a terrible time. I genuinely hate driving, and I'm a little scared of heights, so driving up a mountain on a narro, one-way road made me want to cry a little bit. I was bargaining with Jesus during some of those turns even though I'm like technically Buddhist. Part of why I wanted to leave early in the first place was because I wanted time to just decompress for a second before pitching my tent. 

I did not get to decompress at all. We were already pretty behind, so we had to start setting up immediately. I spent the next couple of hours unloading the car and hammering stakes. My brother kept asking me where shit was because he somehow didn't know, and I was actively losing my mind because I was still super frustrated about the coffee thing, and I already saw my life flash before my eyes trying to get up the mountain. Oh, and all of his friends were an hour or two late for some reason except for two of them. They didn't really help with the set up. 

Whatever, we finally get to start a fire and chill out a little. I got to eat my snacks and have a hot dog and shit, but smoke kept blowing at my chair the whole time, and I had to get up every twenty minutes to grab random shit. I did get to get a bit of a buzz going, but I literally didn't have the time to finish my drinks as fast as I wanted because I had to keep finding flashlights and shit. It hit the point where I was running around so much that I wasn't even in the loop and most of the conversations. My brother was no help grabbing stuff either because he was busy being in what I'm calling ""couple land"" and mostly just focusing on his girlfriend (His girlfriend actually did do a pretty good job of looking out for him though). 

One of my friends did come over and check on me and basically say, ""wow, you are way too sober,"" and we took shots together. But at that point, I just felt kind of sad. I couldn't fucking sit down, and everyone had already formed little groups and were complaining about their exes or whatever. I did go back to hanging out with everyone for a bit, but then we got a noise complaint. A family checked in to a campsite near ours for some reason when they had he massive mountain range to choose from. It was annoying, but I also already knew that could happen, so I wasn't too broken up about it. The rangers pretty much told us to put out our fire and fuck off I guess. My friends and I weren't planning on shutting down completely, but then my brother's friends panicked and dumped the coolers. We all went to bed at fucking eleven. I usually work the swing shift, so I was nowhere near tired. I spent half the night staring at my tent ceiling. 

On the bright side, I did get to chill for a bit in the morning. I went for a little walk. My brother and his friend got the stove working and made breakfast, but then I spent the rest of the time running between the campsite and my car again. Apparently, not all of my brother's friends requested the day off, so most of them had to leave early. The two that did have the day off also left early because one of them had a headache or something. Of course, they all only took down their own tents before fucking off, so me, my friends, and my brother + his girlfriend did the rest. Note: my brother had like seven friends, I brought four. They all just kind of rolled up, enjoyed the already set up campsite (and the food and alcohol, though they did bring drinks too), and left. Cool. 

TL;DR: I barely got to sit down on my twenty first birthday, and then I had to turn in early. Lame. ",0,1751545579.0,Vent,2,0.5,False

## The Problem We All Face

Picture this: You're debugging a SwiftUI view at 2 AM, and somehow your loading spinner is showing while your error message is also visible. Your success state is active alongside your loading state. Sound familiar?

We've all been there with code like this:

```swift
@State private var isLoading = false
@State private var showError = false  
@State private var isLoggedIn = false
@State private var hasValidInput = false
@State private var showSuccess = false
```

Multiple boolean flags creating ""impossible"" states that somehow still happen anyway. 😅

## The Solution: State Machines

Instead of juggling a bunch of booleans that can create chaos, model your actual UI states:

```swift
enum LoginState {
    case idle
    case validating
    case loading
    case success
    case error(String)
}
```

Now your UI can only be in ONE state at a time. No more ""loading while showing error while validating"" nonsense.

## What You'll Learn

In this comprehensive guide, I break down:

🔧 **Building Your First State Machine** - Transform that messy login view step-by-step

🌍 **Real-World Patterns** - Data loading, form validation, shopping carts, and more

🚀 **Advanced Techniques** - State composition, testing strategies, and performance tips

⚡ **When NOT to Use Them** - Because not everything needs a state machine

## Why This Matters

State machines aren't just clean code (though that's nice). They make your app behave the way humans expect:
- When something is loading, it's just loading
- When there's an error, it's just an error  
- No mixed messages, no confusion

Your QA team will find logical bugs instead of impossible state combinations. Your users get predictable, reliable experiences.

I had fought off rogues to save him from bites, endured wolfbane brewed by witches, and even during his in heat, I had even played the role of his mate. 

Even when his new lover was kidnapped by enemies, it was me he sent as the hostage for the exchange.

Everyone thought I was hopelessly in love with Erevan.

After all, our wolves had recognized each other the moment we met. But he loathed such primal instincts and refused to

acknowledge me as his mate. Still, I chose to stay by his side–without a name, without a title.

Even as one lover after another came and went, I remained. My daily job was to manage the chaos they left behind.

And the first time he truly looked at me was when that delicate Omega sobbed.

That was when he ordered me to go in her place for the exchange, tossing out a casual promise that he’ll mark me as

compensation.”

But after I returned, broken and bleeding from seven days and nights of torment, his first words weren’t about my injuries. 

He just ordered me to get back to work.

Erevan stood shirtless, each breath tightening his abs, like something savage and caged just beneath his skin, ready to break

free. 

He was pressing Virelle against the floor–to–ceiling window of his office, whispering the sweet nothings lovers share.

“Sweetheart, I bought you that pink diamond necklace you liked. Just a hundred million–no big deal.”

I stood at the door, face calm. Inside, I felt nothing.

For seven whole days, not even ten million could be scraped together for my ransom.

So it was Erevan deliberately had let the captors torture me longer on purpose.

My knee had only just been reattached by healing magic. The whip marks on my back, the knife scars on my hands–new skin had barely grown over them. They still stung.

But it was fine.

I was about to quietly retreat when I heard his voice, sharp and commanding.

“Stop.”

Erevan glanced at me. 

“There’s a new café downstairs. Virelle wants coffee. Now that you’re back, go get her some. You’ve got ten minutes.”

He gave the order with practiced ease. I nodded with the same mechanical grace.

9 minutes, 42 seconds.

I returned carrying ten different flavors of coffee, pale from the effort.

Virelle had dressed, though her blouse hung open to reveal a trail of hickeys she flaunted with pride.

And my arm, lifting the coffee bags, showed scabbed–over wounds beneath the sleeve.

“It took you long enough. They’re cold now.”

Virelle pouted.

After I reheated them, she grabbed a cup, pretended to fumble, and spilled it on me–right on my open wounds.

She covered her mouth, gasping in feigned horror.

Erevan rushed over when he heard the commotion. His eyes skimmed over me, then softened with concern for Virelle.

“Did it burn you?”

She nodded pitifully.

And Erevan grabbed the rest of the coffee and poured it over my head.

My white shirt soaked instantly, clinging wetly to my skin.

“You can’t even handle this? Liora, this is your punishment.”

The liquid dripped down my bangs, stinging my eyes, blurring my vision.

That made me could barely make out his furious face.

Two seconds later, I bowed my head actively.

“I’m sorry.”

I’d apologized, but instead of softening, his expression turned colder.

That night, Erevan had a formal banquet.

In the past, I had always been the one to accompany him to these business functions. But this time, he brought Virelle too.

He must’ve really liked her.

When choosing my dress, I picked a long–sleeved gown that covered all my wounds.

Erevan frowned. “Why are you wrapped up like that?”

Before I could explain, he added, “Whatever. You’re just Virelle’s background tonight anyway. I don’t need you making an impression like you used to.”

The banquet hall buzzed with laughter and clinking glasses. Many guests came to toast Erevan.

Virelle shrank into his arms, shy and helpless.

“Erevan, I can’t drink…‘

He caressed her gently. “It’s okay, baby. Someone else can drink for you.”

I said nothing, silently accepting glass after glass of red wine and champagne from his business partners.

Once, I only drank for Erevan. Now, I drank for Virelle too.

My stomach burned, cramps twisting inside me.

I barely winced from the pain, but Erevan sharply noticed.

“What’s the matter? I thought you could handle your liquor. Only a few dozen glasses and you’re already tapping out?”

An older Alpha across the table laughed. “Come on, Liora’s known for her drinking. Don’t tell me you’re disrespecting me?”

Erevan’s gaze was icy.

“Liora, apologize to Mr. Gideon. If he’s not pleased tonight, don’t bother showing your face at the Rosenoir Pack tomorrow.”

Mr. Gideon’s greedy eyes dropped to my chest.

“Erevan, you’ve already got a beauty by your side. Why not lend Liora to me for one night?”",1,1751545009.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

>Hi everyone! My name is Sarah Miller, and if you'd seen me a few months ago, you would have found someone who was constantly dragging themselves around. Waking up was already a sacrifice, energy seemed to disappear before lunch, and that constant brain fog prevented me from being productive and enjoying life. Coffee? It became my best friend, but the effect was fleeting and left me even more exhausted afterward. I knew I needed something more, something that truly nourished my body. It was while researching natural solutions to increase vitality that I came across **Tonic Greens**. The idea of a ""shot"" of green superfoods seemed exactly what my body was asking for.  
  
**Does Tonic Greens Really Work?**  
  
Being 100% honest, skepticism hit hard at first. So many products promise the moon and stars, right? But, to my immense surprise and joy, the answer is a resounding YES! Tonic Greens really works. It wasn't an overnight miracle, but after a week of consistent use, I started to notice I was waking up with more energy. That chronic fatigue began to diminish, and the brain fog started to clear.

**Is Tonic Greens Good?**  
  
Good? It's much more than good, it's a nutritional lifesaver! What Tonic Greens has done for my energy and overall well-being is something I haven't felt in years. My body feels lighter, my digestion has improved considerably, and that feeling of always being ""heavy"" has disappeared. My skin looks more vibrant, and even my mood has improved. It's as if my body is finally receiving the nutrients it was missing.  
  
**How Does Tonic Greens Work?**  
  
From what I understand and have experienced firsthand, Tonic Greens is a concentrated nutrient bomb. It combines a variety of green superfoods, fruits, vegetables, herbs, and probiotics that work together to detoxify the body, strengthen the immune system, improve digestion, and most importantly for me, boost energy levels naturally and sustainably. It's like giving your body a ""makeover"" of essential vitamins and minerals.

**Is Tonic Greens Worth It?**  
  
Considering how much I used to spend on specialty coffees, energy drinks, and how much my lack of energy impacted my productivity and quality of life, the investment in Tonic Greens was worth every penny, and much more! The benefit of feeling genuinely well, with clean and lasting energy, is priceless. If you're looking for a practical and effective way to improve your overall health, it's definitely worth it.  
  
**Tonic Greens Benefits?**  
  
The benefits accumulated impressively. The main one, of course, was the drastic and sustained increase in my energy. But I also noticed a significant improvement in my digestion, less bloating, and more regularity. My mind feels clearer and more focused. I feel my immune system is stronger – I went through the last winter without catching a single cold! And, as a bonus, my skin has a healthy glow that I used to only achieve with a lot of makeup.
