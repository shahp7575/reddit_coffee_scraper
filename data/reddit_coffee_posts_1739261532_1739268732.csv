I've had a Glorious XXL mouse pad for years which was great for being easily cold washed in a machine, but the backing plastic has 'melted' off into my glass desk, and they no longer make it in a size I'd like (to fit under both keyboard and mouse, with room to spare).

The Gigantus V2 doesn't have stitched edges, which seems like it might be needed given how much I tend to lean my wrist and arm against the edge of the table - which is where the mouse pad tends to save me some discomfort.

I don't know much about all the models mentioned here - generally items here seem to be two to three times as expensive as the Glorious, so I wanted to make sure they're easily washable without destroying them, especially if paying extra for them. Scrubbing them is less ideal than a washing machine - the occasional bird dropping when I forget to cover the table takes more time than I'd like.

The bird in question is blind and ancient with limited mobility, and her sanctuary is on the side of my desk because it makes us both happy, so that bit is non-negotiable. We're in Australia, so shopping is a little limited.

Thank you if you're able to provide any mouse pad suggestions! ",1,1739268684.0,MousepadReview,0,1.0,False

**Absolute deafening silence**.

The room defied description. **Aaron Wright** sat alone, flanked by two empty chairs and a desk, his gaze fixed on the door—a slab of steel that loomed like a sealed tomb. The summons had been urgent, cryptic. No details, just a command. His fingers tapped a staccato rhythm against his thigh, the only betrayal of his nerves.  

**THUMP**

The door exploded inward. A figure strode through—slender, athletic, her fair white hair catching the sterile light. A tailored tuxedo clung to her frame, shimmering like liquid shadow. Heels clicked with metronome precision as she clutched a clipboard to her chest.  

“Mister **Aaron Wright**, was it?” Her voice dripped honeyed formality. “How are you feeling? Apologies for the abrupt summons. Do let us know if you require… accommodations.”  

Aaron straightened, Marine Corps posture snapping into place. “I’m fine. More than fine, ma’am.” His smile stayed polished, diplomatic. “Though I’d feel *better* if I knew who ‘us’ refers to.”  

“Ah, introductions.” She inclined her head, a strand of ivory hair slipping over her shoulder. “**Elara Imani Tanaka. ‘Lara’** suffices.” A gloved hand pressed to her chest in a mockery of a bow.  

*‘Elara Imani Tanaka. Sure, and I’m Queen Aurora the Inventor.’* Aaron kept his face neutral. “Pleasure’s mine, Lara. ‘Aaron’ works just fine.”  

“Oh, I’m aware.” Her grin sharpened. “Let’s skip the dance, shall we? Your file’s *fascinating*. Anomalous resistance to spatial distortions. Onmyōdō ritual suppression training. U.S. Marine Corps—honorably discharged after neutralizing a Type Green reality bender in Macau. Then PSYCHE Division’s golden boy, brokering the Shanghai Occult Accord to avert World War III.” She leaned forward, clipboard forgotten. “Callsign ‘Ghostbreaker.’ How very… *dramatic*.”  

Aaron’s expression didn’t flicker.  

“You remind me of my brother,” Lara mused, tilting her head. “All stoic charm and calculated modesty. Though he’d have cracked a joke by now. Or a bottle.” Her smirk widened. “Then again, he *earned* his accolades through sheer luck. I wonder—did you skate by on fortune too? Or is there actual *steel* under that pretty-boy veneer?”  

The provocation hung in the air like a grenade pin. She watched, wolfish, for cracks in his calm. None came. Instead, Aaron uncrossed his legs, deliberate as a chess move, and met her gaze. “Ma’am,” he said, tone smoother than aged whiskey, “as delightful as this character dissection is—mind telling me why we’re meeting in person?” His words hinted at impatience, but his voice stayed patient, polite. A lesser man might’ve been irritated by lara's tactics and snapped, but she can see that the diplomat is nothing if not a worthy player. she resists the urge to smile.

Lara’s eyes glittered. She sank into the chair opposite him, steepling her fingers. “Project Horizon Gate.”  

“Never heard of it.”  

“Of course not.” She rolled her eyes. “Let’s pretend you haven’t memorized every classified document this side of the Veil. The Gate’s active. We’ve made… *contact* with the powers on the other side. They’ve requested a single candidate—nineteen years old. ‘Heart of gold, willingness to sacrifice all for the unknown.’ Blah, blah, poetic drivel.”  

Aaron’s jaw tightened. “With respect, ma’am, I’m fi-.”  

“And yet.” Lara gestured at him like a prize showhorse. “Not a wrinkle, not a gray hair. Still look twenty. Frankly, it’s uncanny. PTOLEMY’s prepped the regression protocols—body to nineteen, mind intact. Even your precious soul’s *untouched*. Mostly.”  

“Mostly?”  

She waved a hand. “Technicalities. Point is, you’re the only fossil young enough to pass their test. So.” Her grin turned feral. “Ready to play hero again, Ghostbreaker?”

**“Just when I thought I could finally retire.”**

Aaron slumped into the threadbare armchair, its springs protesting like a dying accordion. Moonlight sliced through dusty blinds, painting his sister’s smirk in silver.  

“Hero, huh?” She kicked her boots onto the coffee table. “Should I start calling you ‘Savior of Macau’? ‘Ghostbreaker the Glorious’?”  

He rolled the word on his tongue like a rotten tooth. “…Hero. Never liked that term.”  

“Why? Too shiny for your grubby conscience?”  

“Because heroes believe in things.” His thumb traced the scar beneath his left eye—a souvenir from Macau. “I’m just an opportunist in a uniform. A coward who outran his own shadow. You know this.”  

She snorted. “Bullshit. You’ve got loyalty thicker than Mom’s borscht. Doesn’t that count for something?”  

“To the UNGOC? To *humanity*?” He barked a laugh. “That’s not loyalty. That’s… damage control. Like throwing yourself in front of a train because you’re too tired to jump.”  

“Hey.” Her voice softened, cutting through his thoughts. “Remember that time Mom tried to make Thanksgiving turkey in July? Burned it to charcoal and called it ‘cajun-style’?”  

Aaron snorted. “Tasted like a military MRE. I swear she used lighter fluid as marinade.”  

“And you ate two helpings anyway.” She tilted her head, suddenly serious. “Because she smiled for the first time since Dad left.”  

The memory struck like a sniper’s bullet. He stared at his notes, watching the glyphs blur.  

“You’ve always been like this,” she pressed. “Choking down symbolic burnt turkey to keep others happy. But you act like it’s some dirty secret. Like caring’s a weakness.”  

“It is,” he muttered. “In our line of work.”  

“Bull. Shit.” She leaned forward, moonlight catching the scar on her collarbone—a twin to his own. “You think I don’t know why you took that desk job at PSYCHE? Or why you really brokered the Shanghai Accord?” Her finger jabbed at the journal on his lap.  

“Heroes don’t exist,” she said quietly. “But guardians do. And you… you’re the worst fucking liar I’ve ever met.”  

He fell silent.  

“God, you’re depressing. And edgy.” She flung a couch pillow at his head. “Where’s the brother who dragged me to that occult black market in ’40? Who ranted for three days about leyline harmonics after finding some ancient books in Siberia?” Her voice softened. “When did you bury that fire?”  

“When the fires started burying others.”  

Crickets chirped outside.  

“…Fantasy land, though.” She waggled her eyebrows. “Elves? Magic castles? Bet their pubs put Esterberg’s to shame.”  

“Or it’s all tentacle monsters and peasant uprisings.”  

“Tentacle monsters need love too~”  

“Fuck’s wrong with you—”  

“Point is!” She leaned forward, eyes gleaming. “Admit it. You’re *itching* to poke the unknown again. And hey—” A wicked grin. “Might finally get laid. Otherworldly princesses dig grizzled hero types.”  

“Christ, *stop*—” He choked back a laugh, shoulders shaking.  

“There he is.” She smirked. “Anyway, what’s the notebook for? Finally writing your memoirs? *Confessions of a Professionally Traumatized Weirdo*?”  

Aaron flipped open the leather-bound journal, revealing pages crammed with glyph-like symbols. “New language. Mission prep.”  

“You. Studying!” She clutched her chest in mock horror. “Who are you and what’ve you done with my arrogantly gifted brother?”  

“What do you mean?”  

“I always imagined you saying, ‘Me? Unlike you lowly maggots, I’ve no need for studying,’ while looking down your nose.”  

“That’s your image of me!?”  

“Anyway, what are you doing?”  

“Cross-referencing syntax structures,” he said flatly. “Building neural pathways through comparative literature analysis. Then I’ll sleep, let my subconscious cement the patterns.”  

“So… you’re brute-forcing fluency. In what, like four days?”  

“Three. Maybe two if the coffee holds and I sleep till noon.”  

She stared. “Showoff.”  

“Dinner’s ready! Come on, hurry up—chop chop!”  

“Alright, just wait a minute. I’m almost finished with this part.”

“Enjoyyy! Bon appétit!”  

‘She’s in a good mood lately.’

He eyed the plate: a hulking slab of steak.  

“Steak again?” he said gloomily.  

“I thought you loved steak?”  

“I do, but…”  

“You… don’t want it?” Her voice dipped into a somber tone, puppy eyes activated.  

“DELICIOUS!!”  

“SHTEAK ISH SHO GOOD!” he garbled through a mouthful.  

“Hoorayyy, you like it!”  

‘She’s delusional,’ he thought.  

‘But this smile…’

‘This is the face I want to protect.’

**He’d outrun every shadow except his own. But hers?  
That one, he’d carry forever.**

Personally I would be happy to work as a cleaner, in a restaurant or a warehouse so I have been applying for these jobs in addition to what I want to do (admin). The only problem is that they either reject me or don’t get back to me at all.

I actually worked in coffee shops and restaurants for almost 11 years up until 2020 so it’s not like I don’t have experience in that sort of thing. But I have applied for loads of these jobs but I can’t even get to the interview stage. Yet I keep reading on here and elsewhere that restaurants and pubs are ‘crying out for staff’.

With warehouse jobs I apply and it’s a 50:50 chance whether they get back to me or not. When they do get back to me the agencies are more interested in sticking me on unpaid training courses than actually getting me a job. 

I actually applied for a warehouse job last week and the agency got in touch with me fairly quickly but then refused to put me forward for the job when they found out where I live as they said it was ‘too far away’. I literally live 25-30 minute drive from the warehouse which I would have thought was a normal commute time.

I have actually been getting interviews for plenty of the admin roles I apply for (just need to brush up on my interview skills) which makes sense as my most recent work experience has been in call centres and admin. But I am not getting any of the jobs I am constantly reading are ‘easy to get’. 

Anyway TL;DR. I am applying for ‘east to get’ jobs  but still being rejected and was wondering if there was something wrong with mr",1,1739268596.0,UKJobs,1,0.67,False

My wife started fasting yesterday morning, intending to do a three day fast. I was making fun of her black coffee and she got mad at me. I felt bad so I said I would join her so that I can be more empathetic.

So I'm on day two now and it has actually been really easy for me. I have been thinking about doing a prolonged fast for a while, but never started because I thought it would be super hard for me. But it's not hard. I'm not struggling at all.

I decided to take advantage of this mindset and just continue fasting until I'm done. I think I'll do 21 days.

I do understand that people usually start with shorter times and I appreciate that some of you will comment on that. If I only do 10 days, that's also okay.

I have been stuck on 137kg for the last 10 years. Sometimes I diet, or exercise. With a keto diet I can usually lose about 10kg. It ALWAYS returns to 137kg. I think it must be a combination of my gut, metabolism and genetics. I eat between 1500 to 2000 calories a day, which should let me lose weight naturally, if slowly. My body DOES NOT LOSE WEIGHT.

I'm hoping that with fasting I can completely reset my gut, my metabolism and my hormones.

Do you feel like you're constantly fighting for attention, only to be drowned out by the competition? You've got a great product, killer service, and a burning passion, but it's just not translating into the success you deserve. Why? The answer often lies in your branding. Strong [branding strategies](https://weandthecolor.com/top-branding-strategies-that-work/196263) aren't just about a pretty logo; they're about crafting a powerful narrative, building lasting connections, and ultimately, driving serious growth.

This isn't another generic list of ""branding tips."" We're diving into the **branding strategies** that have been proven to work, time and again, for businesses just like yours. Think of this as your roadmap to building a brand that not only gets noticed but gets chosen.

Ready to transform your brand from an afterthought to a powerhouse? Let's begin!

# Why Great Branding Strategies Are Non-Negotiable

Let’s not sugarcoat it: in today's competitive landscape, not investing in effective **branding strategies** is a serious business risk. Wondering why branding is so crucial?

* **Cut Through the Clutter:** How do you stand out when everyone's shouting for attention? Strategic branding creates a unique identity that captures attention and lingers in the minds of your target audience.
* **Forge Emotional Connections:** People don't just buy products; they buy into brands they believe in. Great branding evokes emotions, builds trust, and fosters loyalty.
* **Command Premium Pricing:** A strong brand justifies a higher price point. Customers are willing to pay more for brands they perceive as superior or more valuable.
* **Amplify Marketing Impact:** Effective branding makes all your marketing efforts more targeted, efficient, and impactful. It acts as a guiding light for all your campaigns.

In short, branding is the bedrock of business success. It's not just about looking good; it's about building a sustainable competitive advantage.

# Defining Your Brand's Core Essence

Before you can implement any **branding strategies**, you need to understand your brand's core identity. This is the foundation upon which everything else is built. It’s the essence of your brand.

Start by asking yourself some fundamental questions:

* What are your fundamental values? What principles guide your business decisions?
* What’s your brand's voice and tone? Is it formal, friendly, humorous, or something else entirely?
* What’s your unique value proposition? What problem do you solve, and how do you do it differently?
* Who is your ideal customer? What are their demographics, psychographics, and buying behaviors?

Understanding your brand identity allows you to communicate consistently and authentically. This consistency is what builds trust and recognition over time, and informs every strategic decision you make.

# The Power of Visual Communication

Your visual identity is the first thing people see. It's the visual representation of your brand's personality and values and one of the first aspects customers will associate you with.

Therefore, it’s critical to nail this down. This includes:

* **Logo Design:** A memorable and visually appealing logo is essential.
* **Color Palette:** Choose colors that reflect your brand's personality and evoke the desired emotions.
* **Typography:** Select fonts that are legible, aesthetically pleasing, and consistent with your brand's overall style.
* **Imagery:** Use high-quality photos and graphics that are relevant to your brand and target audience.

Maintaining consistency across all platforms will create a cohesive and professional brand presence. Remember, your visual identity is often the first impression – make it a good one.

# Storytelling: The Heart of Effective Branding

People are naturally drawn to stories. They remember stories, relate to stories, and share stories. Crafting a compelling brand story is one of the most powerful **branding strategies**.

Your brand story isn't just a history lesson; it's a narrative that explains your ""why"" – why you started your business, what motivates you, and what impact you're trying to make on the world.

Let's imagine a brand story about a coffee company that focuses on sustainable farming and fair wages. This kind of story can resonate deeply with consumers who value ethical and sustainable practices.

Create a brand story that your audience will find compelling.

# Building Authority Through Content Marketing

Content marketing can help you build brand awareness, credibility, and engagement. Provide value, answer questions, and solve problems for your audience.

Some examples of content marketing include:

* **Blog Posts:** Share insights, expertise, and industry news.
* **Videos:** Create engaging video content that educates, entertains, or inspires.
* **Infographics:** Present data and information in a visually appealing format.
* **Podcasts:** Host a podcast that discusses topics relevant to your industry.
* **Ebooks:** Create in-depth resources that provide valuable information to your target audience.

The best thing you can do is create content that is optimized for search engines, shares valuable information with your target audience and is aligned with the overall **branding strategies**.

# Maximize Social Media for Engagement

Social media is essential for building brand awareness, driving engagement, and fostering community. Choose the platforms where your target audience spends their time and create content that resonates with them.

Don't just broadcast your message; interact with your followers, respond to comments, and participate in relevant conversations. Social media is about building relationships.

# Customer Experience: Deliver on Your Brand Promise

Your brand is more than just what you say it is; it's what your customers experience. From the moment a customer interacts with your brand to the moment they contact support, every interaction shapes their perception of your brand.

Providing excellent support, providing excellent customer service, and creating a seamless and enjoyable journey for your customers will help you achieve an excellent customer experience.

Positive customer experiences lead to repeat business, positive reviews, and word-of-mouth marketing.

# Cultivating a Strong Employer Brand

How your company is perceived as an employer is your employer brand. Building a positive employer brand can help you attract and retain top talent. Your employees become brand advocates.

Some strategies to cultivate a strong employer brand include:

* Investing in company culture.
* Offering competitive compensation.
* Benefits.
* Creating a supportive work environment.

# Measuring Success: Tracking Your KPIs

You must be able to measure your success with **branding strategies**. To do this, track your progress. This helps you identify what's working and what isn't.

Key metrics to track include:

* **Brand Awareness:** (website traffic, social media mentions, reach, and impressions)
* **Brand Sentiment:** (social media, reviews, surveys)
* **Customer Satisfaction:** (surveys, feedback)
* **Engagement Rates:** (likes, shares, comments)
* **Sales and Revenue:**

By tracking these metrics regularly, you can measure your **branding strategies**.

# Consistency Is Key: Building a Brand That Lasts

Building a strong brand is a marathon, not a sprint. It takes time, effort, and consistency. Focus on delivering value to your customers. Building a strong brand that lasts requires consistency and patience.

The most successful brands are authentic and transparent. They are committed to delivering value. By focusing on these principles, your brand will stand the test of time.

I met him over the summer, back when i was 17. he was sat next to me and talked to me first, he was quite nice and quite handsome, I had no prior experience of anyone making a move on me so I was very very flattered, especially because he was older, i was going to start my last year of high school, he was on his second year of college. he asked for my instagram so I gave it to him.

we started texting just a bit and then he invited me out for coffee and it was quite nice. a little bit awkward but in general we spent quite a long time talking. 

later throughout summer he started calling me once in a while, we talked like three or four times in august. then in september it all kind of faded naturally. 

I have ocd and quite a lot of social anxiety and you should know I was not initiating anything at all, any of our conversations. I mean, when I actually talked to him, i talked a lot and im talkative and outgoing and alright in conversations but it always had to be him who started them cause i was always too stressed and worried he probably doesn’t like me anymore (for no reason – that’s anxiety for you i guess) so he was the only one putting in any work so its normal it ended.

I wasn’t too sad or anything cause to be honest I didn’t even know if I liked him?? and I had this stupid physical reaction any time he would call, I was just so stressed, my breath got shallow and my hands were literally shaking, so these months without him were a relief.

fast forward to november I turned 18, he once randomly called me and I got scared and didn’t pick up. silly, I know but I guess I have problems, I was just so scared. then I texted him that I couldn’t pick up at the time and he said he’ll call another time.

and he did, I picked up and we had a conversation, in the middle of december. it was always way scarier in my head than in reality but it was still awkward always and I wasn’t enjoying myself too much. back then in december he also casually asked me if I wanted to go out with him one day and stupid me said sure even though I really wasn’t sure but I really didn’t know how to reject.

he called me again in january and we talked and it was so awkward!!!!
I DONT KNOW why he hasn’t stopped calling me. I don’t think I’m crazy awful or ugly or anything but at the same time I STILL HAVENT GIVEN HIM ANY SIGN IM INTERESTED, I still never started a conversation but HE KEEPS CALLING ME ONCE IN A WHILE!!!! WHY!!!!

I don’t think im interested in him, really. he’s a really nice guy but I think we’re not a match and I think I have my own stuff to work through and I’m just not that interested but im also sooooooo stressed by all this cause I really dont want to be mean. I feel like a bad person. maybe it’s stupid to write all this about something that’s barely even a frienship but it’s the first time ever I’m experiencing something like this and it’s so big for me.

I could never be direct about my disinterest with him cause he also never was forward about being interested in me. its not romantic but I think there is something implied cause why else would he keep on calling even though i haven’t given him anything? GOSH I REALLY DONT KNOW WHY HE WANTS ALL THIS AND ITS FRUSTRATING

I don’t want to talk to him anymore, it causes me so much stress and if he is actually interested in me, it’s giving him false hopes. my sister says I should just ghost but I don’t think that’s a good person thing to do. I don’t want to be mean, he was always nice. please tell me what would you do/what is a nice and civil thing to do.",0,1739268075.0,relationship_advice,2,0.33,False

But actually- coffee and toast and marmalade is a normal thing to eat. Sure, it's not perfect nutrition. It's just NORMAL. And because of MJ I know I'll eat 1 (one) smallish slice. And won't get hungry for ages. And then my lunch will be sensible and small. And dinner will be modest and I won't want pudding. 

I'm writing this because I tend to feel guilty and ashamed- and I know others do too - when we read posts about how wrong and lazy it is to 'just rely on the jab' and not combine it with a new kind of diet or calorie counting. 

For people like me, MJ means a normal life. It means the anguish of a lifetime of diet and restriction and calorie counting is over. Because our brains allow us to say: not for me thanks, I'm not hungry! Or: actually I am hungry but just a small piece would be lovely. 

It's true that my ""normal life"" means a good diet and above average exercise so perhaps irs easier for me to take this approach because I didn't eat junk food and was active. But anyway. Normal life. That's what MJ has given me. 6 months in, just over 2 stone down, and a normal life. So I guess - if you're one of the posters who tends to fulminate about people who 'just' do the jab - maybe remember there are people who 'did everything right' their whole lives (I once had a wisdom tooth out on an empty stomach and then walked 50 minutes home because I was 'on a diet'!) and were still obese. And now they've escaped!",2,1739267978.0,Mounjaro,2,1.0,False

We are friends and although I can tell he’s interested in me, it seems like he’s just not gonna be the first to make a move. He’s extremely supportive and always ready to give advice. He’s got the right amount of masculinity too, and I’m admittedly smitten with him. We bonded over our past long-term relationships that went wrong. We’d gone on a few coffee dates, initiated by him, but as the time draws nearer for both of us to move to different cities for a few months, I’m getting more keen to lock things down, but he’s not taking the action. Ironic, since he’s been telling me for months that I need to be open to dating after my last break up.

Now I’m questioning whether or not he really is as open (emotionally) as I thought. He teases me about being a flirt and having many admirers, but I feel like these comments are not serious and that he can see that I value him over others.

**Most Importantly**  
I do not accept things that have ""adult"" content in them, or simply have objectifying content.  
I realize this is subjective, but to give you an idea of what I mean, if it would be even slightly embarrassing to watch/play around your parents or any children, it's probably not something I'm interested in.  
That means, I don't like anime, most TV shows, most video games and most movies.  
I'm looking for someone who, if not lives that way already, is not opposed to living that way.

Brunch around 11am
- Coffee with half a teaspoon of honey and oat milk followed by sweet potato's or some other type of yam.
-sometimes I make oatmeal waffles (oats, banana, oat milk)

Snack 
- lots of fruit, usually a whole apple with peanut butter, mango or grapes or nuts. I try not to buy junk food but I definitely over indulge in fruit.
-sometimes it's a large bowl of air popped popcorn with coconut oil and nutritional yeast 

Dinner
- Rice with fish or chicken or beef and a side of veggies this is 5x/week probably 

Drinks-

I painted swords of my unit with a dark green speedpaint, and want to try to highlight them on the edges now with a brighter green, and also the line in the middle of the sword. The thing is i dont know how to fix it if i dont like it or make a smudge? I tried to find some youtube videos but those were all videos about normal paint mistakes.
I guess i will have to repaint the entire sword in white and apply a new coat of speedpaint/contrast on it? As applying another coat of contrast wouldnt cover it up in case of light contrast paints, or in this case with a dark contrast, it would just become darker and darker.

1imujqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1imujqi/why_most_elemental_systems_and_magic_systems_fail/,Why Most Elemental Systems (and Magic Systems) Fail (OPINION),"Hey all- Before I begin I want to make this very, very clear: **This is an opinions-piece, not a rule.** Please do not take what I say to be my end-all-be-all judgement on everything out there. Do not think for a second that even I believe I am 100% right in all cases with what I'm about to say. This is just some observations and thoughts I have on the subject- please feel free to expand upon anything I say here, or to point out exceptions to anything I say here, and I encourage you to openly disagree with *anything* I say here. My one request is that you do so for the sake of furthering a conversation, not to start an argument. Now... onto the rant.

Most people attempt to design a Magic system where *anything* is possible, where all forms of magic could be expressed under the right conditions, and where anything can be added or removed and explained rationally. *This is not the point of a magic system.* Almost everyone gets drawn into a magic system by seeing it happen, we start asking questions: ""What can it do?"", ""How do you do it?"", ""How do I do it?"". Sometimes people will tell you to think deeper, ask more meaningful questions: ""What's the cost?"", ""What can't it do?"", ""When shouldn't you do it?"". Then, you get the others who argue that all of those questions aren't what really matter, instead you need to ask bigger: ""Where does magic come from?"", ""How has it shaped the world?"", ""Why is it in the world?"".

All three of these approaches are just one perspective on the same, larger, purpose of magic in a story: **Magic is a plot device.** That's... literally it. Think of *any* piece of **narrative media**, literally any, where you found the magic was compelling, or interesting, or immersive. A ""good"" magic system, by your definition, being *used in a narrative*. All that magic did was give a plot-reason to explain how Point A became Point B instead. It's a universal McGuffin. ""How do I bring back my character's biggest fear? Hex them with nightmares!"", ""How do I make these two characters who hate each other be stuck together? Put a spell on them!"", ""How do I get my characters back from their quest without spending another 6 months in-world travelling? A portal spell!"". That's all it does. It turns A into B, *but with flair!*

And there's nothing wrong with that- that's part of what makes it great! It makes the magic meaningful to the plot, but the counter-balance to that is making it believable to the reader. You're delicately balancing ""Impact"" with ""Immersion"". Those first two lines of questions I provided earlier, those are the balance. One asks the possibilities, and the other asks for the limits. The third line of questions- it's focused more on marrying the two together. See, no plot-device can be relevant separate from the plot itself. You need to tie it into the broader painting.

Imagine a rom-com between a couple unfolding, they have the inevitable misunderstanding, and before they finally reunite instead here comes Charles, a wealth philanthropist who is exactly the Lead's type and now the final scenes are the Lead marrying Charles- some guy never before mentioned in the story. Or imagine Sleeping Beauty, where the Prince first finds her and goes to kiss Aurora but... she doesn't wake up! Why? Oh, well, because it has to be on a full-moon but nobody mentioned that part until now. You have to make it *blend*, and that's where the World-Building part comes into play.

What so many of these magic systems that *do work* do so well is they establish possibilities, limitations, and context. That's it. The difference between ""Hard"" and ""Soft"" systems then just boils down to how clear they list those three elements out. The reason so many magic systems fall so *flat*, especially when posted out of context, is that they've lost the third axis entirely. We're just looking at ""Possibilities"" and ""Limitations"" with zero Context- and that leaves us to either tether it to our own reality and look at it as if it was applied to our world today, or to abstract it into a settingless scenario where anything *could* happen and thus there isn't really any point to look at ""Possibilities"" or ""Limitations"".

If I said ""Here is my magic system! You have to have a tool, make certain gestures, and say certain words and then a spell will happen!"" Most of the people on this subreddit would say ""That's been done before and sounds really boring..."" and they'd be right! Almost every magical system *has* been done before, at some level. So then what makes the magic in one setting good and another bad when they're ultimately the same? Context.

Example: Harry Potter. We all get the gist, yeah? Wizard, meet Wand, Wave Wand and Say Words, Spell happens. The words... don't really matter to the reader. It can be any combo, it can be any gesture. JK Rowling could throw *anything* at the character and decide on a whim if the perfect spell exists or not and we'd never notice, hell- some wizards don't even need to speak or gesture or use a wand by the end of the series. Compare this to Rainbow Rowell's ""Carry On""; this is a real trilogy, but it started as a fictional fan-fiction being written by the protagonist of Rowell's other book ""Fangirl"", where that character writes fan-fiction about that world's version of ""Harry Potter"".

Still with me? In Carry On the magic works exactly the same- wand meet words and gesture, said by a wizard, and boom- a spell. *Except*, it's more complicated than that. You see, *any* words can be used, and the gestures aren't all that important, but you need to understand the *meaning* of that word and use that with focus to channel your intent. Harry Potter uses poorly-translated latin, but one can be loosely translated to ""Open Lock"" and it does that... opens locks. In Carry On they would say ""Open Sesame"", and it does the same. Looks identical. What's the real difference?

Well... in Harry Potter they don't tell the ""Muggles"" because they want to control them. In Carry On they don't tell ""Mundies"" because *they* are the majority of the populace. The words Wizards use only get power based on how *Mundies* use and understand the word. A great example of this is when they go to America and how one of the best wizards they know can't cast a *single* spell here and he can't figure out why! Another character realizes it's because all of his words are *British slang*, of course it wouldn't work in America since nobody would know the slang here! Beautiful example of a minor bit of *Context* making the entire system feel more palpable and weighty.

So.... I promised to talk about Elemental Systems- eh? Alrighty, let's get into it... What's the point of an Elemental System? Psychologically, us Humans are predisposed to resort to Heuristics- basically cognitive ""shortcuts"" so streamline our thought process. ""Phone, Wallet, Keys"" is a common one, the unconscious ritual of checking you have the essentials before you leave the house. Useful for those truly forgetful, but I'm sure we've all done the check only to realize we left our cup of coffee sitting- it's because the shortcut allows us to *not think* about it, not as much anyways.

Because of heuristics we heavily rely on sorting and categorizing, or maybe it's the other way around? Either way, we love categorizing things. ""Hot and Cold"", ""Mind, Body, and Soul"", ""Salt, Fat, Acid, and Heat"", ""ROYGBIV"", etc. The list goes on. Eventually our categorize complicate themselves into charts, grids, or wheels... from there, usually Webs or Networks... and finally into a Spectrum. Look at something as simple as ""color theory""- what field of science does color theory fall into? Maybe Chemistry, since the chemical composition of the pigment gives it the color? Well, then again Physics argues that light would bounce off the object and into your eyes. Biology then steps-in and discusses how the image activated your retina and that information is sent along the Optic Nerve to the brain. Then of course here comes Psychology, talking about the neural pathways and neurotransmitters released to process that color and illicit a response in you. Then Sociology would see how that color changes the patterns of behaviors in an individual, and thus a population of people. Then, Anthropology might point out that the response of that color differs across culture- and a Historian might provide those accounts along with the Chemical processes used to create those colors... see what I mean?

Groups don't really work as a total embodiment of *everything* in a system, but grouping is one of many ways we utilize heuristics. So... *lean into it* in your story. You don't *want* the reader to be consciously aware of your magic systems during your entire story- you want them engaged with the story! Sure, you should have substance in the magic system too, and there will 100% be people like us here on this subreddit who love obsessing over the magic system just as much as the story, but that's why we have the axis of Context. Context allows us to make a magic system which exploits our heuristics and grouping tendencies so that we can rationalize them through the way the world itself is shaped.

The second issue people make is trying to categorize *everything* in the world under one categorical system known as ""Elements"", the first issue though is that they try to make the categories *before* the world itself. The reason the elemental system of Avatar works *so well* is because it covers everything the world needs to be worried about. Notice how when we as a reader are taken somewhere in the world under extreme circumstances the bending changes? In the swamps they bend mud and plants more freely, in the desert they bend sand itself, in Kora lightning and metal bending are more common than ever because they are the biggest resources for the nations at the time.

What I'm trying to get at here is that **the elements of your system need to reflect your world**, if one changes then the other should too. We saw this in ""Carry On"", and it didn't even have strict elements! Look at Mistborn, look at Shadow and Bone, look at literally any good elemental system and tell me that isn't true... *no seriously, please do... it would help point out a flaw in my heuristics!*.

1imuios,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1imuios/i_love_my_boring_office_job/,I love my boring office job,"Sometimes when I´m at my boring office job and feel a bit sick of it, or time is moving slowly and the day is dragging, I think back to what jobs I have had throughout my life. Suddenly I realise that it is not so bad. 

  
My first job was in home care, it was stressful as all hell and the pay was abysmal. There was little to no room for actual coffee breaks or some days even a proper lunchbreak. You got 30 minutes of lunch per day but if the alarm went off and a caretaker needed help you had to drop everything and go there immediately. All my colleagues were middle aged women who were all talking trash behind eachothers back. I was at that job for 6 months. 

  
The next job was at a carshop where it was much of the same stress as in home care. A jam packed schedule everyday and if a customer walked in the door during your 30 minute lunchbreak the boss expected you to help them on the spot, even if you were eating. Much as the previous job everyone in the staff was fighting all the time, just with the difference that they were screaming directly at eachother instead of throwing shade at eachother behind eachouthers back. The difference here was of course that the workforce all constisted of middle-aged men instead of middle-aged women. The boss at this place was an emotional wreck who solved all his problems by screaming at, and blaming the staff under him, it was hell. When you arrived at work 06:00 in the morning you didn´t even get a proper ""good morning"", you just got dealt the first carkeys of the day and were expected to get to it. I worked there for a little over a year. 

I got tons and tons of more examples of different jobs I´ve had which all more or less, sucked the life out of me.   
Sooner or later I realised that I can´t keep working jobs like these for 50 more years and I need to do something else. I couldn´t see myself dragging myself through this all the way to retirement. 

  
After some hard work I managed to land an office job and now I finally get the feeling ""okay, now I understand how people can work all their life without wanting to kill themselves"". 

This job is a dream come true for me, sad as it sounds. I work monday through friday, I have flexible hours, I can go to the gym during my lunchbreak which is an hour long, if I want longer lunch some days no one bats an eye as long as you can keep up with the deadlines and what not. I can sit in a nicely decorated office with air condition. I can listen to music while sitting comfortably at my computer in a comfortable chair. I can dress however I want, I can work from home whenever I want. The pay is good. The boss is a great guy and he doesn´t micro-manage you at all. He has literally said ""I don´t care if all of you just sit around drinking coffee for the whole day you´re here, as long as the job gets done somehow"". My colleuges are good, normal people and they are easy to get along with. The staff is pretty 50/50/male/female which i think is good for the work environment. Life is GOOD.

* I could have left the shampoo and soap at home, but since it takes up no space I brought it anyway.

Sell the paid account status for 2.90$. This is not even a coffee, but it will save you a ton of trouble and give you a stable income. ""Free"" account tiers should be able to play only ""normal"" zones, while ""paid"" accounts are free to enter any zone they want. **Also, give paid accounts ""elite"" status during that season.** (maybe a 2x2 safe box too? idk.)

Reset account status to ""free"" each season. So everyone should pay for the paid status each season. That way you will keep earning money each season and have fewer hackers. If a player wants to buy the ""paid"" account status while the game approaches the next season, you should transfer the status to the next season too. E.g. if I buy the paid status prior to 45/60 days before the next season, my paid status should be transferred.

Our company’s admin assistant is around our age as well and she VERY OBVIOUSLY has a crush on my boss, always goes to the lunch room when he does, comes into our office constantly, gets overly excited when talking to him and generally just flirty.  This makes him pretty uncomfortable (Which is understandable).

Anyway, so a few weeks back, he told us that whenever we were around the office we were to check what she was doing and report back, so he could avoid her.  We go to the lunch room and shes there? Go back and let him know so he doesn’t go get his lunch until shes gone, etc etc you get the drift.  Some actually started doing it too.

At first, I thought he was just joking around about it and laughed, but last week he made a snide comment at me for not letting him know she was around the lunchroom when he was about to get his coffee.  I let it go, but he brought it up again after his after work drinks and then chewed out one of my co workers for similar (in a sarcastic way more than an actual reprimand by the way).

I asked him if he was actually being serious, he said yes and so I straight up said that I would not be doing it or getting involved.  Told him that that this is what I would expect from school kids, not someone in the workplace, especially not a manager to his subordinates.  Also said he show man up and either confront her or go to HR.  He gave me the silent treatment the rest of the night and has hardly spoken to me since.

I feel kinda bad about it, because although I think I’m right, we always had a pretty good working relationship and would talk all sorts of things non-work related as well and I’ve probably just ruined that.",6,1739264291.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

So I’m going to be starting uni in February, I’ll be studying Ecology and Biochem. I’m really excited but also quite nervous as I wasn’t a very good student in high school, I’ve always had focus issues and trouble paying attention while reading. However I’m almost 26 and I’m more mature, responsible, and I’ve learned which tools work best for my attention short comings. I have such passion for ecology, mycology, microbiology, toxicology, bioremediation, the list goes on. I spend most days listening to said science podcasts, audiobooks, watching Ted talks, reading books and science articles. My favourite way to enjoy a Saturday morning is to find a good article to read with my coffee or go fungi hunting with my partner during autumn. Been doing this for a couple years now. 

My mom however is really unsupportive and doesn’t think I should go. I’m unsure if she doesn’t think I’m smart enough, doesn’t agree with what I’m going to learn or what. She often hates when I talk about what I read in an article, shuts me down and changes the subject , angrily argues what I’ve said or sometimes tries to gaslight me. I’d never try to lecture her, I just want to tell her what I learned in a fun interesting way but she kind of jumps straight to patronising me and warning me I won’t make a career out of it or I won’t make much money. I already did a trade qualification and I don’t want to continue in that industry and she knows that. 

For some context: She and my stepdad have become pretty conservative in the last 5 years and often say things that are quite ignorant. Things like cars don’t contribute to green house gasses/pollution or invasive species are too small to cause damage. Greenies are just dumb/bad/corrupt etc etc.

Idk how to deal with it, it makes me really sad and seriously doubt myself. Does anyone have any family members like this and is there a better way to approach people like this?",5,1739263516.0,ecology,11,0.86,False

1imu79t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTraitors/comments/1imu79t/i_am_new_to_traitorland_and_i_am_shocked_at_who/,"I am new to Traitorland and I am shocked at who people are saying is the ""best traitor"" or ""best player"" is","here is my essay lol; I just started watching the Traitors US version last week and I already watched Season 1, Season 2, and have caught up on Season 3 and will go on to Australia next. After I was done with Season 2, I typed into Google "" Season 2 Worst Traitors Ever Reddit"" and was surprised to see a post that summed up many people's feelings saying Phaedra is the best Traitor ever and is iconic. I was taken aback and thought she was a weak Traitor!  Before you downvote, please let me explain why. For one, I think all of Season 2 Traitors stunk. For two, I don't necessarily think someone's an excellent Traitor based on ""how far"" they go into the game. People can slip by just existing, not by being masterful.

Yes, Phaedra went far, but she was able to get that far because she had boneheads Dan and Parvati shielding her as the more obvious Traitors by their actions ( or inactions ) COUPLED with the fact Phaedra had friends in the house already due to her Bravo family plus maybe a couple more that wouldn't dream of voting for her. People zeroed in on Dan first because he kept quiet, did not talk game with anyone, and would not share his ideas or thoughts. He did act as if he had nothing to worry about. He seemed very relaxed. Then they zeroed in on Parvati because she had a resting bitch face the whole time and never acted as if she cared about anything, never really defended herself with passion, and like Phaedra said she acted like an ice queen. Both Dan and Parvati made some rookie maneuvers that made people point the finger right back at them. 

Those traits stood out in those two Traitors that shielded people's eyes from Phaedra who wasn't doing herself any favors. Her friend group covered her pretty well. Phaedra also acted like nothing bothered her the entire time, almost like her shit didn't stink. I didn't see her intently investigating who the Traitors were. At every breakfast she barely had any reactions to who walked in the doors, she never seemed stressed. She just CHILLED. I never heard her say things like ""As a faithful, I want to find these traitors and get them out"" or ""I'm stressing I'll be murdered next""  or any of those feelings that normal Faithfuls have. SHE SKATED by. Everyone around her was stressed to the max and had severe reactions to how they were feeling and being genuine at not knowing who was going to walk through the door at breakfast and all she could muster up was ""Ohh that tastes good"" as she ate eggs or  ""please pass the coffee"" like she could give a rats ass about anyone. That could be crafty editing on the production's part, but.... Phaedra did nothing special and she didn't defend herself that well when someone called her out. Her reaction was ""how dare you call me out"" like she was queen. She screwed herself by going after Trishelle in that glass name-breaking challenge out of the blue making it look suspect even if her intentions were not to block her from the shield. Then instead of murdering someone from her click to make a last-minute attempt to throw the scent off her, she did the predictable murder of John who was on her case for banishment. 

And of course, Kate wasn't a great Traitor because she was the same way. She came in as a wild card, and couldn't care one way or another, she didn't put a game face on and try to sway anyone or defend herself in any meaningful way, she was just herself which I can appreciate because I don't think she cared to win. There is an art to being a Masterful Traitor. You have to be manipulative, even just a dash. Casually. You have to plead your case, you have to share, you have to pretend, you have to try to look like a Faithful...but not too hard. In moderation. A happy medium of talking and listening. I'm not impressed by people who sit back and blend in, do nothing, and do not play in some way. 

And even though, I don't like her, I have to give mad props to Trishelle for being whipsmart in the game. I will give credit where credit is due. She was the one who was smart enough to know Parvati was a Traitor but her banishment could wait because Phaedra was a Traitor and it would be harder to get Phaedra out so they needed to start on getting her out earlier. And she was the one who was right when she guessed there were 2 more Traitors in the midst when it was dwindled and the question was asked. She was immediately right about Kate being the remaining Tratior. She made compelling arguments about who she voted for (mostly).  

One mistake she made (and the reason she rubbed me the wrong way) was when she came after Peppermint at the beginning of the game. I cannot remember word for word what Trishelle said but said some remark like ""If I'm murdered tonight then I know you are a Traitior"" yes she was joking but I feel if someone wasn't ready for it or doesn't know someone's sense of humor then a of course Peppermint might have a ""WTF?"" look on her face? So of COURSE Peppermint's face changed. Peppermint made a shocked face because she was shocked at the comment. Then Trishelle went and gossiped about that moment to groups full of people. It was such  NONISSUE but Trishelle decided to repeat it at breakfast and make an even bigger deal out of it. Trishelle just knew she ""caught"" Peppermint. And what sucks is that it was TRISHELLE that created that moment because of her ""joke"" comment to Peppermint and because P is human she responded how one responds. Peppermint didn't create the awkward moment. Did Peppermint get a bit defensive defending herself? Sure but up until now no one knows one another that well and how they normally act and that shouldn't be played against her. Did Peppermint mess up and accidentally flub her words and insinuate she was a Traitor? Yes, but again it was all a response to her defending herself from a moment that was created by Trishelle. So I blame Trishelle for being careless and causing Peppermint's banishment. But I will give T props on a well-played game. I don't understand how she was NOT murdered by someone but to each their own. 

And if I were going to name anyone THE BEST TRAITOR of the US Version up until now I am saying hands down Cirie, DUH. She played well. She carried herself well, made the right connections, and was authentic. I mean the other two at the end were SO convinced that Cirie was a Faithful, they really thought they were sharing that money 3 ways and started celebrating early.",0,1739263305.0,TheTraitors,1,0.5,False

Now, I got knocked up (baby girl is 5 months old now), manipulate, gaslighted, lied to, used as well (this continued even when I was pregnant) I used to have savings, but I spent it all on him, and I was left with nothing.  All because I believe he was the one— so I tolerated it, thinking that it was normal. That was what he said.

Now, I finally broke away. Atlast.

But it left me with nothing on my name and no savings.

They had 5 minutes to create an outfir out of their normal clothes and military workout gear AND serve it on the runway AND do this runway on top of the bus AND do this runway on top of the bus in front of a big group of soldiers. You might say it's way too horny. I'd say it's a Hello Cystitis Gala because some girls go out IN MARCH IN LOW TEMPERATURE on this bus in bras and panties! I swear I saw smoke coming out of mouths and these women don't care.

Anyways, Masha L wins this challenge while wearing a boring black sack dress. For a shopping spree and some lessons at Cosmo Academy, she chooses Masha M (because she needs good clothes) and Arina. They receive AN outfit and tacky pink graduation caps.

Their photoshoot is IN A DIFFERENT PHOTO STUDIO (yay) but with Igor Vasialidis again (damn it). Maxim wears an awful wig and tells girls pros will paint flowers on their bodies. It's a semi-nude shoot because they were lucky to keep panties. In the midddle of preparations, Timati, a well-known Russian rapper, just pops up in the studio with a cup of coffee, checks out the girls (ew), gets height-shamed by Masha L (slay) and then leaves. Liza is called an exotic flower by Maxim (yikes) and Anastasia gets more photos than other girls because, well, she gave birth recently and her breasts are rather present in photos. This might be the only time Max actually does a somewhat nice thing and asks artists to paint flowers on Nastya's back and re-shoot from that angle because he didn't want her figure to be shamed on panel (trust me, others will get roasted). Masha L yells out BS during Anastasia's shoot (not cool, girl).

The entire morning-before-panel is just a confessional from Ksenia T that she had a good sleep (9pm-7am) and woke up early which meant she could wash her hair properly.

At panel, Alya Badyanina is the guest judge. She's pretty good, actually. She gives her comments on that awful runway show, the photo and panel pressense. Get Mikhail and Elena out, hell, even Ksenia Sobchak and have Inna and Alya do this whole show. Main points: almost half of these girls receive a FAT THIGHS comment (where exactly???), Masha M is praised for her face (yay), Irina's photo provokes a Jimmy Aaja moment (a specific drag queen in Brooklyn just got a Batman signal), Liza finds out her photos are always good (while she was in the bottom two last week), Masha L forgets Alya's business card and gets cooked about it (which is somewhat fair, Alya says Masha fully didn't milk the moment of having a 1-on1 with her and Anna Matveeva from Cosmopolitan Shopping) but stars of this panel are twins. First, Olga gets a Snow White reference and then judges (who the host compared to gnomes) find out our weirdo queen's inner world wants red hair. I'm not joking, Olga REQUESTS a second makeover! At the same time, Ksenia T is sad because she broke her favourite bracelet. SOMEHOW, it is enough to put her in the BOTTOM TWO with Ksenia V who is told her photos lack energy (guys, you gave her a FCO and several high placements, are you serious?). Oh, and Anastasia gets FCO (cannot wait for drama to unfold). Ksenia V is sent home as another robbed goddess (everyone was decent at this shoot tbh).

Next week, we have horses, someone getting hurt and UNDERWATER SHOOT. Will I have to cover someone's nipples? Who gets punched by a horse? Will Ksenia Sobchak have a I look like a horse joke (in Russia, almost everyone compares her face to a horse including herself)? Will Olga get a new makeover? Find out next time!",4,1739262928.0,ANTM,4,1.0,False

# Chapter 2: For Whom Do You Play Go

>!The chapter starts with a flashback. **Akiyama Kousei**‘s friend asked him what he’d do if the Go class he planned to join was full of unbeatable players. Kousei replied that losing was never a consideration.!<

>!Back at the Go salon, the receptionist said she could tell why Kousei had come, just by looking at him. Kousei said he was reeling from the news and in a foul mood. **Shirayama Kogane** was surprised to learn that **Enomoto Midori** 1P had once frequented this Go salon. Kousei was surprised to see Kogane there, despite having brought him there himself.!<

>!The receptionist asked Kousei what his next move was. Kousei replies that he wants to win against those 5 players. He wasn’t sure why, but after defeating Kogane, he could think of nothing else. The receptionist suggested that he play a game with her. She had a lot of questions for him. In a dramatic double-page spread, she declared, ‘Go players always talk during a game.’!<

>!The receptionist’s name is revealed to be **Okano Tamaki**. She will be taking black while Kousei will be taking white. Kogane asked if she was a strong player. ‘Not at all,’ she replied. She placed four stones on the star points and suggested Kousei give her a four-stone handicap. Kogane thought to himself that while Go’s rules might seem complex, they were actually quite simple. You just need to get more territory within the confinements of the 19×19 space. The area enclosed by your stones constitutes your territory, measured in points. In professional games, the game can be decided by just a few points. A four-stone handicap is roughly equivalent to giving your opponent 30 to 40 points from the start.!<

>!Tamaki’s first question was, ‘How did it feel to play Go again after so long?’ Kogane mused that the key to handicap games lay in closing the gap with aggressive play. He expected Kousei to take his time, but Kousei immediately made his first move. Kousei replied, ‘The first thing I noticed was how cold the Go stones felt.’ He explained that he remembered playing there every day, and the frustration of feeling talentless because he couldn’t win. However, today, for the first time, he had won. Then he saw Midori on the news, and he was stunned. He admitted he’d been furious ever since.!<

>!Tamaki chuckled. ‘You haven’t changed a bit,’ she said. They exchanged moves on the board. Kogane observed that while Kousei played well, Tamaki’s defence was impenetrable. Tamaki said it must have been difficult for Kousei when things didn’t go his way, but that’s life – things rarely do. She asked him why he chose Go. As she spoke, she made a move that threatened to capture his group on the right side of the board. She pointed out that Kousei was intelligent and athletic; he didn’t need to choose Go, yet he’d returned. Even now, there was no guarantee he could beat those five players, and he might face the same disappointment again. “Were those 3 months you spent on Go worth so much to you?” She asked.!<

>!Tamaki told Kousei to take his time and think while she got some coffee. She asks Kogane to join her. Kogane suggested she was being too serious. She countered by asking how many games he himself had lost. Kogane says that he lost 1452 times and won 3813 times. She says that Kousei lost exactly 1000 times in 3 months. Most people would have given up after ten losses, but Kousei, clinging to his belief in his talent, persevered. That’s why he was so thoroughly defeated, utterly broken. Now that Kousei had returned, she believed he wouldn’t break again.!<

>!Returning to the game, Kousei made a move, surprising Tamaki by continuing to focus on the right side of the board. “Everyone says the same thing,” Kousei says. He’d heard it countless times: he was just normal. And he knew it was true. It wasn’t just Go; he’d experienced the same realization in other areas too. He felt his sense of invincibility waning day by day. As he continued to play strong moves, he said that it could only be Go. On the board, the centre is gradually turning into white territory. Kousei declared that as long as there was even a sliver of a chance he still possessed some talent, he would defeat those five players and reclaim his title as a genius.!<

>!Kogane observed that White had skillfully used his strong position to secure territory in the centre. Tamaki’s initial advantage from the handicap stones had vanished. Reflecting on Kousei’s words, Kogane told him that he still believed he was a genius. With that, he left the salon, vowing to be the one to inflict Kousei’s 1001st loss.!<

>!Tamaki remarked that defeating those five players would be a monumental task, but perhaps Kousei could now succeed, having experienced both the depths of defeat and the thrill of victory. She mentioned she would try to contact one of the five players. Just then, a girl opened the door, asking Tamaki for some barley tea. Suddenly, Kousei was transported back to the agonizing memories of his repeated losses against one of the five, the stinging rebukes for stalling when he clearly lacked the skill. He asks her to play a game with him. ‘Well, if it isn’t noob Kousei,’ **Ichihara Hazuki**, the girl at the door, sneered.!<

I’m having some inconsistent results with extracting an espresso shot. 

Using Quickmill Pegaso machine with 22gm VST basket. Use a WDT distribution tool and coffee is ground to a level I believe is where it needs to be (still slightly grainy in between fingers when rubbed). I have a 58.3mm tamper. 

Some shots only get poured from one spout on the portafilter. Others both simultaneously just take way too long to start after pre infusion (like up to 20 seconds)

Only thing I can think is that I am not consistently tamping well. I’m told that a 58.5mm fits perfectly into my basket…wil the extra 0.2m make a difference? (I do see some coffee on the walls on the basket post tamp meaning maybe it’s not pressing down to the very edge and creating channels

1imtysm,https://i.redd.it/88kd21nhzgie1.jpeg,[Mentalist Rewatch] 7x05 The Silver Briefcase,"This anniversary rewatch will run daily until February 18, the 10-year anniversary of the Mentalist's series finale.


**SPOILER WARNING: Since this is a rewatch, it's assumed that anyone in these discussions has already seen the entire show, so all spoilers are allowed.**


Day 141 brings us to ""The Silver Briefcase,"" which opens with the crime. A quiet neighborhood, a serene house. A man in a white shirt washes his hands and then fixes the thermostat and turns off a fan. A bloody foot in a high heel is visible just at the edge of the screen, and the man leaves. Cut to Cho and Lisbon doing a training exercise. They fire paintballs at two others and ""rescue"" Jane, winning the exercise. Abbott collects on a bet they made between their teams. Jane and Lisbon continue their conversation about leaving, and Jane assures her there's a lot they could do with their time. Colonel Raymond says hi to Lisbon, and Jane's senses tingle. He asks if Lisbon ever had a fling with him, and when he brushes it off, he says something is off about him. Lisbon tells him that his wife was murdered eight months ago. We get a bass guitar version of the Mentalist intro and the final episode of the show directed by Simon Baker.

Title relevance: Jane and Lisbon trick the colonel and his girlfriend with a silver briefcase.

Notable guest stars: Allison Dunbar (from Quick Draw and the Sopranos), Jama Williamson (from The Good Place and Parks and Recreation)

Location: Austin


Notable scenes: 
- Jane and Lisbon pitch re-opening Colonel Raymond's wife's case, and Abbott resists. Jane insists there's something off about him. Lisbon backs him up. He gives them the green light to proceed but says they must do it in secret. Jane asks for a fist-bump, and Abbott gives him one.
- Cho starts by talking to the detective on the case under the guise of a civil rights case coming from the man who was nailed with the murder. He shows Cho evidence that cleared Colonel Raymond, including time of death from her liver temp.
- Lisbon and Jane go to talk to the man convicted of the murder, and he tells his story. Jane asks if he killed Nicole Raymond, and Jane stares at him, reading his reaction. 
- Jane and Lisbon go to the Raymond house, which is for sale, and they pretend they're house-hunting. Lisbon asks what the catch is, and Jane insists she spill the beans. The Realtor admits there was a murder. They pretend they need to speak in private, and as soon as they're alone, they take out the crime scene photos and make observations, noting that certain things don't line up. Jane and Lisbon form the theory that he altered her liver temp by utilizing the temperature of the house.
- Jane goes to visit Colonel Raymond in his office and tries to gauge how he reacts to provocation. Having observed special African art in his office, Jane has the team start scoping out the people in the office to see who shares that interest. While they're in the fishtank, Wylie keeps sneaking glances at Vega, and in the middle of their meeting, Jane tells Vega to call Wylie in the next time he steals a glance at her.
- Wylie is sent to Raymond's offices undercover as an IT tech, and he walks into the office of Michael Novotny (the name of the show's production designer). He ends up finding Denise Sparks, who has similar artwork as Raymond.
- Jane has Lisbon scope out Denise at a coffee shop and report back her observations. He asks Lisbon for her gut reaction, and she says that Denise could have done it.
- Wylie and Vega do a test run of the alibi, figuring out where the clothes they theoretically dumped could have ended up. They do a grid search of the area, and Wylie finds the scrap of a shirt matching the one in the photo.
- Raymond shows up at the office and asks to speak in private with Lisbon. Jane notices and follows. Raymond asks her if she thinks he murdered his wife. Jane says he does. Raymond confronts Abbott and says the investigation ends now. Lisbon tries to sound enthusiastic, but Abbott isn't convinced. He tells them nothing less than a confession will convince a prosecutor, and Jane tells Lisbon that's what they'll go for.
- Raymond and Denise show up at the training facility from earlier, both having thought they were meeting the other. Jane carries a silver briefcase, which he says holds a report from the crime lab that will incriminate one or both of them. If they confess before the briefcase is opened, they get a deal. If they don't, no deal, and they have five minutes. Colonel Raymond tells Denise they should go, and mind games between the two couples begin. They tell each other they love each other. Raymond barks at Denise not to be stupid, but Raymond talks first, blaming Denise. She immediately blames him. 
- In interrogation, they each tell a different story, and we're treated to two different versions of the crime. I can't remember exactly, but this might be the only ambiguous case on the show, where we don't have a definitive answer on the killer. (Personally, I found Denise's version to be more convincing.) After it's over, Vega asks Jane who did it, and he asks if it matters, then leaves the case and goes home. Wylie and Vega can't resist looking, but inside is a note that says ""Curiosity killed the cat!"" the line that Vega said to Jane early in the episode. Jane and Lisbon watch from the hallway and Jane meows, startling them.
- Lisbon tells Jane that the case proves that he'd get bored without their work, and they start bickering about what they could do if they quit. Lisbon shoots down the idea of sailing around the world, citing scurvy, pirates, and seasickness as reasons why she refuses. He suggests they take up beekeeping and puts his arm around her as they walk to their car.
