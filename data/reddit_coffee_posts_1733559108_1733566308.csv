You take roots where you are. So growing up in an abusive environment didn't help with the downward spiral that he was heading into. The fact that he got the best grades and still failed to get into a good institution, felt like a cloud of expectation that kept following him. Clouds of judgements followed. It felt like a stumble but it was the sense of abandonment from the close ones that felt heavy. There would be moments where things seemed to take a good turn but the burnout was starting to sink it's teeth deeper everyday; and he was just in his teens.

When a girl about the same age showed interest in him, he had a new purpose to keep going. She was a pretty religious girl with a dull personality, but he didn't know any better and it was enough to put colour to his already monotonous life. He cared for her like a child. He loved her more than he ever could. He wanted to go far with this boring girl. But she had a story of her own, unwilling to share, unbeknownst to him. 

He didn't know how to deal with her narcissism so he chose to shower her with love. He created an expectation that things get better with age. But wisdom never comes with age. He didn't know it was unwise to do *things* just to appease her. He didn't know his actions would make his future self squirm in disgust. Her nature was subconsciously making him lose respect for her and the more he tried to love her, the more he lost his self-respect. It's very difficult to maintain a healthy relationship when issues never get resolved and yet creep up occassionally. Also the fact that he caught her meeting with her ex, who was trying to get her back, disturbed his peace further. He lost a huge chunk of respect for her when they found a wallet with a lot of cash and ID. He insisted that he should get it to the owner but she was against the decision. ""Shareef banke kisko impress karega?"", she said canonically. It was painful but he tried his best to move on. But his studies were at all time low and he just couldn't focus anymore. Everything felt like a bizzare dream and he was floating away. After failing exams, he had to drop an year to move somewhere far to prepare for the next ones. Being young and broke, he wanted to see her before leaving but barely could afford any transport. But she insisted that he come to her designated place of meet, a restaurant. Turns out he is short on the bills and asked her to add some. She yells,""Paisa nahi hai toh kisliye milne aya!"". It was awkward for the waitress and he was shamed. She never looked back or even say ""goodbye"". With his last ₹20 he leaves for home on a down note. 

An year goes by fighting, falling out of love, and struggling to pursue careers. All the while, his mental health worsen, so does his crave for alcohol. He was in a dire need for a vacation, but it was time for college. Being in a toxic long distance relationship didn't help a bit. He kept missing classes. He felt lost as if he was buried deep down in a landfill somewhere unknown. Alcohol didn't make the cut so he resorted to other means to feel ""alive"". Lost his old friends but made new ones and that didn't seem to make any difference. He was detached and lonely. The adrenaline rush and the anger that almost makes him jump off the building kept building inside him. Soon he learnt that cutting himself gives a sensation to overcome his numbness.

He wanted to talk to her about his mental health but she kept ghosting him and didn't seem to care or gaslight him for the situation like she always did. But he was too naive to see and still hoped for better days. 

Later he encountered women that wanted to sleep with him but he kept his loyalty. Unfortunately, one day she calls him few days before his birthday and breaks up. Although it was painful to break-up out of the blue but he respected her decision and agrees. Ironically, soon he finds out that she was already in a relationship with someone else few months prior to the break-up. 

He felt relieved because he had a closure. He loses every feelings or respect he had for her. Realisation hits him hard as if he was sleeping for too long. His room was filled with trash. Beer bottles filled with all sorts of cigarette butts here and there despite an ash tray. Tobacco shreds everywhere. Only xeroxed notes other than empty notebooks. Cups filled with thick coffees. Rotting food residues all over the room. Some floor area was sticky due to spilling of beverages. To him, the smell didn't make a difference because he was living in it. 

Suddenly he wanted to make up for the lost time. He wanted to get back to his career, hobbies, and friends, etc. He started being scared of coughing up blood everyday. So he started to quit smoking and eventually succeeds. The more he grew, the more he understood his traumas better. He may have said things or did things due to lack of emotional maturity but he was proud that he maintained his ethics as much as possible.  This realisation was a fair boost in self-esteem. With every overcoming of problems, he became confident again. This eventually improved his friendship and his outlook. 

You take roots where you are, unless you learn to walk. The hardest part was to forgive himself. It was the only way to love himself better. One day he let go and it was a smooth sailing from there on.",1,1733565755.0,ArunachalConfession,0,1.0,False

1h8pbth,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h8pbth,Husband Indifferent! Finally found poop after years of mentioning sounds. What pest and next step!?,"City-dwelling American living in Germany (I say this because I have experience with living with a variety of types of pests during my formative years... I've experienced roaches, mice, spiders and ants, but I'm really only familiar with roaches and their poop thanks to a shoddy place I rented a decade ago as a first time adult on my own. Ive been thankful to learn that Cockroaches are not common in Germany! 
Husband and I moved into a country-ish located duplex in Germany a few years ago and since then I've experienced and mentioned a few times to my husband that Ive heard what sounds like something in the attic. I requested him to please investigate but he sort of laughed it off. This has happened a few times and when we added 2 cats to the family and I noticed they seem aptly captivated by the same sounds and sources of sounds as I was perceiving them, I brought it up again. But I felt met with indifference and so decided to shut up about it. 
Now pulling out the Christmas decorations from the bottom floor (we live in a 3 story duplex w/ a fenced in yard that is backed against a small pathway to a community park/building area and hillside with goats) where we keep them stored in a small utility closet that used to have washer/dryer hookups and still has a small sink in it. The closet is located next to a bathroom and is across from the 'hetating room' where there is a wood pellets stove system and water heater. The heating room also has door access to the backyard. 
I'm unpacking the decorations and discover what looks like mouse or rat poop to me. But I can't tell if it's that or roach poop!? (I'm used to the coffee grounds and trail/smudge experience, not this ..) 
Some of the poop pellets seem to be white? 
I immediately showed my husband and requested help but he doesn't seem to believe or care. 
He doesn't want to text the landlord because he doesn't think there's an infestation and he doesn't even know what kind of pest it is. He keeps saying what can the landlord do about it? What do you expect him to do if there's no mouse? I need help identifying this poop please and I need some advice on how to get help with what next step needs to be taken and how to say it such that my husband actually takes me seriously.

I'm new to this fascinating (and frustrating!) hobby and need some advice. 

I'm at the stage where I'm able to consistently pull some decent shots with the following parameters: 
- 1:2 ratio 15g in 30g out 
- timing 25 to 30s 

Yet I get the impression my shots are too sour. I've tried to grind finer to increase extraction time but I'm at the limit where my machine starts choking. 

I see several possibilities where I could not be doing the right thing: 
- I get the feeling I tamp with inconsistent pressure which affects the result. Should I get one of those spring loaded tampers to eliminate this variable? Say tamp at 25lbs each time and adjust grind size to get to the extraction time I want? 
- Should I increase my ratio? Say 1:2.5 instead of 1:2? 

Do you have other adjustments or ideas to improve the balance of my shots? 

If any info missing to be able to advise, please ask.

1h8p2bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h8p2bk/brewhead_water_tastes_off_after_maintenance_help/,Brewhead water tastes off after maintenance | Help needed from mechanic🔧 (no brewing advice🛑!) [Expobar Brewtus 4 - Dual boiler | Rotary Pump with water inline/Varia VS3 grinder],"Hi guys,   
  
I have a brewtus 4 and have been making delicious espresso since may with it (I bought it second hand). I was so happy😊 with my machine, but now it's driving me nuts 🥜. 

**Problem**  
I'm new to doing maintenance on my own so it could well be I'm making a rookie mistake on reassembling the brew head for example because, that's when all my coffee turned🍋. After reassembling the brew head, because of a squeaky lever all the coffee tastes🍋. It's been driving me nuts. I need help how to diagnose where the problem is coming from. The water from the brew head tastes foul, not acidic, but more rubbery or I don't know the exact way to the describe it  


**Double check the basics (for a thousands times)**  
\-my water quality is reversed osmosis with remineralizing cartridge  
\-5 different kinds of beans freshly roasted all turn🍋 (medium and dark roast)  
\-tried different temperatures 92°C-96°C  
\-extraction time is 25-30 seconds  
\-grind coarser doesn't make a difference  
\-16 or 18 grams in and 32 grams or 36 grams out  
\-I've tried all different settings and it just stays 🍋  
\-flowrate is 289 in 30 seconds with IMS screen  
\-temperature and pressure are measure at the brew head (pressure is 9 bar and temperature as suited to the beans) 

These settings I've played with them with the fundamental brewing tips, but it makes no difference, so I'm confident it's something in the machine. The brew head water also just tastes a bit slightly off. Which makes me think it might be the deaerorator, OPV or pump. 

Anyhow here is a timeline of my maintenance:

**September**   
Did full descaling for 30/45 minutes (water came out green and was all clean afterwards) (Calcinet professional descaling agent for E61) after this my coffee was perfect

**October**   
Lever was squeaky, so I removed the lever and put some silicone (food grade) lubricant on it

[⁉️☕➡️🍋](https://emojipedia.org/exclamation-question-mark)**November**   
Lever was still squeaky, so I dissembled the entire brew head and soaked the parts in cafizza --> after this moment  


See the pictures below for how the parts looked, not to bad I think, but I decided to replace all the parts (except the brew head itself), including the mushroom head just in case. However it did not impact the taste of the brew water of espresso.

https://preview.redd.it/qxpnp8ww5e5e1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54514917d619d397a9a316afa7607c004c510fa3

After this maintenance the problem is still ever present. My logic sense said I assembled something wrong. The pre-infusion was also not working properly, so I figured out I accidentally switched the brew spring with the pre-infusion spring. After this indeed, the pre-infusion lever worked like it supposed to, but the coffee and water still had the same taste. Maybe I place a gasket wrong? A ring? I don't know.. Could it be this simple? I replaced all the PTFE rings with new ones. 

**Diving deeper -** [🥽](https://emojipedia.org/goggles) After this I dived in deeper into the machine, I thought maybe descaling agents or limescale had  move up somewhere, so I emptied the boilers and check them with an endoscope. The boilers looked pretty clean as far as I can judge, I saw a little bit of scale at the bottom, so I decided to descale again, but no avail. 

[Steam Boiler](https://preview.redd.it/mczb4yl27e5e1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27adf318aa8490d4747c177f731c4c561086e957)

**Loads of water** 💦 **-** After doing all this I figured maybe limescale or descaling agent has stuck somewhere, so I let approximately 10 L of water go through it, but no avail...

**Rotary pump instead of Vibration** 🎉- To my surprise I have a rotary pump instead of a vibration pump, when I bought the machine second hand, the owner told me it was a vibration pump and I really didn't know the difference, but I'm glad to know now it's a rotary pump. However, I did initially (in May) adjust the brew head pressure with manometer to 9 bar (instead of the 10 bar it was giving) via the OPV, rather than adjust the locknut on the rotary pump. I don't know if this perhaps could have put extra stress on the pump for these months and maybe some rubber parts or so have worn off? Is there a safe way to open the pump and inspect it for erosion and such?   
After discovering this, I did adjust the OPV back to 11 bar with the brew head open (via adjusting the rotary pump) and adjusted the brew pressure with blind filterback to 9 bar. Now when I backflush the OPV stil doesn't run, because it barely hits 11 bar with a blindfilter. Maybe this also indicates something is wrong with the pump or OPV?  
  
**OPV💨** \- I was able to screw loose the OPV and check the spring, but the OPV was very stuck to the pump, so I did not completely dissemble it, but from only checking it from the part where you adjust it, it looked fine as did the spring. 

**What else it could be?**  
Could it be the deaerorator or OPV? The deaerorator is hard to reach I believe, because I would have to remove the entire boiler.  
Could it be the pump? How to inspect the pump safely?  
Am I thinking way to complicated and is it more likely I just did assemble something improperly in the brew head? Gasket?  
  
I'm clueless, after this final attempt to figure it out on my own, I'll bring it to the expert...  
  
Any input on how to diagnose this machine properly is very much appreciated.  🙏

I’ve seen some people use cut and polished wine bottles with a valve added, as a substitute for a more expensive lab set up. But I feel like the cost difference isn’t worth all the fuss. It still comes out about the same price as just buying a lab funnel and stand. 

So I’ve been looking around and see they make pour over coffee makers that look like they function the same way with the drip method. 
Could I just and a stop cock valve to it and use it for alcohol tinctures instead? The funnel is a bit small, but I’m only trying to make 1-2oz tinctures at a time.

1h8oykh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1h8oykh/how_to_choose_the_perfect_furniture_for_your/,How to Choose the Perfect Furniture for Your Home's Aesthetic,"Creating a cohesive and inviting home starts with selecting furniture that aligns with your aesthetic vision. From minimalist vibes to bohemian charm, the right pieces bring harmony, style, and functionality to your space. Here’s a guide to choosing the perfect furniture to enhance your home’s aesthetic, with a special focus on versatile and trendy options like a [rattan coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-coffee-tables), [rattan armchair dining](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/oslo-dining-rattan-chair), [round coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/coffee-tables-side-tables/round-coffee-tables), and [rattan side table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-side-tables).

# 1. Understand Your Home’s Aesthetic

Before diving into furniture shopping, identify your home’s design theme. Is it modern and sleek, cozy and rustic, or eclectic with bold accents?

* **Bohemian Aesthetic**: Opt for natural materials like rattan, which exudes warmth and texture. A **rattan coffee table** paired with a neutral area rug can set the tone.
* **Modern Minimalism**: Look for clean lines and uncluttered designs, such as a **round coffee table** with a smooth finish for subtle elegance.
* **Rustic Charm**: Choose earthy tones and wooden furniture. A **rattan side table** can add a rustic yet refined touch.

# 2. Mix Functionality with Style

While style is crucial, don’t overlook the practical aspect of furniture. Think about how each piece will be used daily and how it complements the room's purpose.

* **Living Room**: A **rattan coffee table** isn’t just stylish; its sturdy design and natural texture add character to your lounging area.
* **Dining Space**: A **rattan armchair dining set** combines comfort with visual appeal, making every meal a cozy experience.
* **Bedroom or Patio**: Use a **rattan side table** as a functional yet stylish surface for books, plants, or beverages.

# 3. Consider Scale and Proportions

Furniture should fit the scale of your room to avoid a cramped or sparse look.

* In smaller spaces, a **round coffee table** can soften sharp angles and create a more open flow.
* A compact **rattan side table** is perfect for tight corners, adding charm without overwhelming the area.

For larger rooms, pair a **rattan armchair dining set** with a statement lighting piece to define the dining zone.

# 4. Focus on Texture and Material

Texture plays a key role in elevating your home’s aesthetic. Rattan, with its woven design, is a standout material that bridges boho chic and timeless elegance.

* A **rattan coffee table** adds organic texture and pairs seamlessly with soft furnishings like plush throws or cushions.
* **Rattan side tables** bring depth and a sense of the outdoors inside, perfect for a breezy, natural vibe.

# 5. Prioritize Versatility

Choose furniture that can adapt to changing trends or purposes.

* A **round coffee table** works in living rooms, but it can also be repurposed as a centerpiece for casual gatherings.
* A **rattan armchair dining chair** can easily transition to an accent chair in a reading nook.

# 6. Play with Colors and Accents

Let your furniture set the foundation while you experiment with accents. Neutral-toned rattan pieces, such as a **rattan coffee table** or **side table**, provide a versatile backdrop for colorful throw pillows, bold wall art, or vibrant rugs.

# Why Rattan Furniture Stands Out

Rattan furniture offers a unique blend of durability, lightweight construction, and natural charm. Whether it’s a **rattan coffee table** for your living room, a **rattan side table** for your patio, or a **rattan armchair dining set**, these pieces bring warmth and style to any space.

By choosing furniture that balances aesthetics and functionality, you can create a home that reflects your personal style while remaining comfortable and inviting. Incorporating versatile staples like rattan and round designs ensures timeless appeal and enduring satisfaction.

We are off to a new worlds with more stuff to ~~steal~~ liberate. 

Our next stop will be the world of (Danmachi, The walking dead, or Percy Jackson & the Olympians) 

I will be hitting all 3, you get to **pick 1 world**. I’ll drop you off in a random location on your chosen world. Warning: anime worlds will likely feel odd, an will take a bit to adjust. You’ll have 1 year in your chosen world to steal things, after that we’ll be going onto the next job. >!Or I’ll send you back to your home world if you’ve had enough of this kind of life!<

Another note: the perks you receive from me will work in all the worlds we visit, but other powers may have some …. issues.

If you have the Crew perk, you can bring your crew with you on these jobs to other worlds. You can also bring what you have stored in the prison pocket and poaching perks. 

* If you agree to go on the 1 year job, you can pick 6 perks >!+1 perk if you have made a 6perks in the last 3 months!<. 
If you refuse, you remain on earth and gain 2 perks from the **Cover jobs** section as a farewell gift. 

You get 1 week to prepare before we depart. 
____________ ____________ ____________

Enemy detection: you know the precise location of anyone or thing that means you harm. Also know the type of harm they intend (physical, emotional, social, etc.) (this can also warn you about potential harm to those individuals and items you care about) 



Run away: this is one of, if not the most important skill for a thief, the power to get away. This perk gives you the power to run just fast enough to get away from anything that is pursuing or threatening you. You don’t get tired from using this. >!You could potentially run away forever, if for instance you piss off a god that is way beyond your capabilities!<



Smuggler: if they pay enough, you know how to find & get whatever people want. Cost scales with value, rarity, and difficulty of acquisition.  



Rat nest: >!Rats need a rat nest, thieves need a hideout.!< Speaking of hideouts. 
You get your own fortified hideout, which exists outside the bounds of time, space, and even reality (a small pocket dimension). This renders it beyond the reach of almost anyone, and even those that do reach it will find that it's protected by an impenetrable field. Only those that you allow will be able to enter. The main feature is the vault inside the hideout. The vault will grow larger as you collect more money/valuable, so you'll never run out of room to store your treasure.  You can teleport into and out of your hideout at will, when you teleport out you return to the exact location you entered from. The hideout starts with a 10 bed & bathroom mansion along with (10 miles / 16.09 km) of land around it. You can build and add onto your hideout if you want and have the ability to. 




King of thieves: you gain Authority; a power that grants you the right to rule, enforce orders, and establish mortal laws within your dominion. Your commands hold an irresistible influence, incapable of being disobeyed by your subjects. You can summon any/all of your subordinates & followers to your side at will.  
>!What use is it having a bunch of authority if you don’t have anyone to boss around.!< So I’ll give you this bonus because I’m a nice thief sometimes. >!They exist.!<
Subordinates: you can create subordinate thieves to carry out jobs and act as the fall guy >!I’m sure you can come up with some other uses for them!<. You can create them with a weaker version of any powers you have besides this perk, about 1/32 of the original’s strength. 
You can customize their personalities and appear, this can’t grant them any powers, but you can make a talking bipedal cat or a purple ork. 
**These ‘Thieves’ don’t have any supernatural powers besides the copies of your own powers that you grant them at creation.** And as this is a bonus, you can only create 1 subordinate a day. 



Grave robber: this allows you to steal from corpses. You can take powers/abilities from corpses. You can access assorted local realms of the dead, this allows you to steal assorted valuables along with souls of the dead. If you bring these souls back to the land of the living, the individual will resurrect. Warning: most realms of the dead don’t want to release the souls that they hold, and often respond violently to intruders. 


Card shark: This perk is for straight up cheating. You always win or get the cards, dice rolls, coin flip, number, spin results, etc, you want.
Works on gambling, lottery, gatcha, even roleplaying game dice rolls. >!Of course most casino worth their salt will have supernatural protections that block this, like the casinos in the black market!<


Scammer: You gain amazing social skills and overwhelming charm which you can use to easily and efficiently seduce, charm, persuade and manipulate all but the strongest willed or most stubborn individuals. You also gain the skills to perfectly control your tone of speech, voice and body language, to expertly send all the right signals. With this you can easily wrap almost anyone around your little finger in a matter of moments. At will you can develop an appropriate personality for your current situation (you can switch between any personalities you’ve gained at will). 


Casanova: gain a small but permanent increase in appearance/energy by absorbing the feelings of love, lust, awe, and admiration directed at you by others. This also allows you to redirect physical and energy attacks (this does require conscious effort, and has a cooldown of 10 seconds). >!This is mostly for showing off. It’s so much fun to send a hero’s ultimate attack off in a random direction!< 


Foolish thief: The less you understand what is going on the luckier you are. (The won’t reduce your luck below base level even if you gain supernatural understanding). >!Useful for staying alive and avoiding sneak attacks. And it’s very funny to watch a fool run around with this perk!<


Techy: some thieves prefer using gadgets and doodahs.  You intuitively understand technology, this allows you to easily modify and improve existing tech but not create something entirely new. And as a bonus, this allows you to magically create **individual** machines parts, if you want to try making things yourself (this allows you to make any mundane parts, and copies of any special parts you have owned before)

____________ ____________ ____________

And some stolen perks I acquired in that last reality:

Body: you can grant a new body to others, anything within mostly-mundane human range. This doesn’t grant any powers but if you want to make someone blue with bunny ears and a little cotton tail, that’s doable. (Recipient must be alive/undead)


Nondescript Travel wings: some wings of unspecified origin. This perk lets you manifest two wings on your back, which you can summon and dismiss at will. You have complete control over the wings as a natural feature of your body. These wings allow you to fly at a max speed of 100 miles per hour.
While the wings are summoned, you can teleport to any place you have been before. And you can safely fly in space with the max speed being the speed of light. (Travel outside of the “chosen Job reality” will be locked for the duration of the job. The same applies to future job universes)


F**** Deal: Deals you strike must be followed or some terrible consequence will befall the offending party. The type of penalty that will be incurred depends on the deal made, being suitably ironic and completely devastating to the dealbreaker. 


13 steps of disaster: this power is activated at will. Each consecutive step causes one of these disasters to occur in the area you target. You can select the disasters to occur in whatever order you want, but you can’t repeat any until you have used them all once for that set/cycle. Options are:     rot/decay, fissure, earthquake, drought, fire, flood, tornado or waterspout depending on environment, whirlpool, freeze, shatter, gravity (crush/smash), pull (everything in range is pulled towards the middle), volcanic eruption.

","
## Quick Summary

As someone who's experimented with various diets, I found the 21-day Smoothie Diet (which replaces two daily meals with nutrient-rich smoothies) to be effective for weight loss and improving energy levels, rating it 4/5 stars for its convenience and nutrient density.

While the [Smoothie Diet plan](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/smoothiediet.php) offers benefits like easy meal prep and guaranteed fruit/vegetable intake, it does have drawbacks including high grocery costs and potential hunger issues for active individuals. Based on my experience, it works for weight loss but it's best suited as a short-term reset for those who enjoy smoothies and want to jumpstart their health journey, though you'll need a good blender and solid meal planning skills to succeed.

If you're considering this approach, here's my first-hand experience that might help you decide.

The concept is straightforward - you replace two meals (typically breakfast and lunch) with nutrient-packed smoothies while having a regular dinner. After trying it for the full 21 days, I'd rate it 4 out of 5 stars.

**Pros: What worked well:**

- If you're busy like me, the convenience factor is huge. I could quickly blend my breakfast and pack my lunch smoothie for work
- **It's surprisingly filling when done right** - I learned to add protein powder and healthy fats like avocado to make the smoothies more satisfying
- Also don’t hesitate to experiment and maybe try adding in [fiber supplements like psyllium husk](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1gh471u/master_list_of_best_fiber_pills_and_supplements/) to your smoothies or get some support from [glucomannan](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1azp8ok/best_glucomannan_supplements_pills_for_appetite/) to help with appetite suppression, managing cravings.
- Getting your daily fruits and vegetables becomes effortless
- I noticed improved energy levels after the first week
- The variety of recipes prevented flavor fatigue
- I did lose weight steadily, likely due to the natural calorie reduction

**Cons: Where it falls short:**

- The initial prep and shopping can be overwhelming - you need lots of fresh ingredients
- It can get expensive buying fresh produce, especially out of season
- Some days I really missed chewing actual food for lunch
- If you're very active, you might find yourself hungry between meals. I suggest getting some support from caffeine pills or other appetite suppressants and fiber supplements.
- The transition back to regular eating needs careful planning to maintain results

**My practical advice if you try it:**

- **Invest in a good blender** - it makes a huge difference in texture
- Prep and portion your ingredients in advance to save time
- Consider adding protein powder to make smoothies more filling
- Keep healthy snacks handy for hungry moments
- Don't skip the solid dinner - it helps with diet adherence

In my experience, [this diet works best](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/smoothiediet.php) if you're looking for a structured short-term plan to reset your eating habits or jumpstart weight loss. All in all, a decent meal plan and definitely worth giving a shot!

However, if you have a physically demanding job or workout intensively, **_you might need to modify the plan to include more substantial snacks._**

Remember that while I found it effective, any diet's success ultimately depends on your lifestyle and preferences. If you enjoy smoothies and want a straightforward approach to increasing your nutrient intake while losing weight, this could be worth trying.

## What Is the Smoothie Diet?

The **Smoothie Diet** is exactly what it sounds like — a diet based on consuming **smoothies** as your primary source of calories. **Make sure you** [**join from the official website**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/smoothiediet.php), to get official support and benefits like community participation.

**Created by health coach Drew Sgoutas,** it’s structured as a **21-day meal plan** aimed at helping you lose weight, detox, and improve your energy levels.

People love the convenience, as smoothies are easy to make, and it feels like you're getting all the good stuff like fruits, veggies, and superfoods in a single glass.

**Here’s how it works:**

- Replace **2 meals a day** with smoothies (typically breakfast and lunch)
- Have **one solid meal** for dinner
- Fill smoothies with **nutrient-dense ingredients** like fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, and healthy fats (e.g., seeds or avocados)
- Include **healthy snacks** between meals (suggested options: nuts or boiled eggs)
- The plan provides **different smoothie recipes** each day to ensure variety and prevent boredom

The Smoothie Diet ensures a variety of nutrients while being lower in calories, leading to **weight loss**. It also promotes itself as a **detox program**, helping cleanse your body. For those who struggle to eat enough **fruits and veggies**, it’s an easy way to boost nutrient intake without feeling deprived.

## How Does the Smoothie Diet Work?

If you're wondering how the **Smoothie Diet** actually works, it’s pretty straightforward.

- It typically involves consuming **two smoothies per day** (replacing two meals), and it’s recommended to have a solid meal that’s rich in lean protein, healthy fats, and vegetables for your **third meal.**
- Snacks are allowed, but they should be healthy, like fruits, nuts, or boiled eggs. You’ll also want to stay hydrated throughout the day with plenty of water, herbal teas, or black coffee.
- Smoothies can be packed with nutrient-dense ingredients which give you a balance of carbs, protein, and fats to keep you full and energized throughout the day.
- The key is the **calorie deficit** — because smoothies are generally lower in calories than a regular meal, you’ll be eating less overall while still nourishing your body.
- It also helps to reduce the temptation of grabbing unhealthy, high-calorie foods when you’re in a rush.
- One of the biggest benefits of the Smoothie Diet is how **easy** it is to prepare. You don’t have to spend hours in the kitchen — just throw your ingredients into a blender, and you’re good to go!

## Potential Benefits of the Smoothie Diet

### **1\. Weight Loss**

By swapping out regular meals for smoothies, you're likely to create a **calorie deficit**.

### **2\. Improved Nutrition**

If you're someone who struggles to get your daily servings of **fruits and vegetables**, this diet is a convenient way to boost your intake. Smoothies can be packed with a variety of **vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants** that support overall health.

### **3\. Better Digestion and Detox**

The high **fiber** content from ingredients like leafy greens, berries, and flaxseeds can help improve digestion and keep you regular. Some also claim that the Smoothie Diet helps with **detoxing** the body.

### **4\. Convenience**

Smoothies are quick and easy to make, and that’s one of the reasons people stick with this diet. Whether you're busy or just don't feel like cooking, blending up a smoothie takes a lot less time and effort than preparing a full meal.

## Smoothie Diet vs. Other Popular Diets

### **1.Smoothie Diet vs. Keto**

- The **keto diet** focuses on consuming high fat, moderate protein, and very low carbs to push your body into a state of ketosis, where it burns fat for energy.
- On the other hand, the [**Smoothie Diet**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/smoothiediet.php) is rich in **carbs** from fruits and vegetables, which can give you a quick energy boost but might not be ideal for those trying to cut carbs.
- While the **Smoothie Diet** is more accessible and easier to follow for most, keto may deliver more **sustained fat loss** for those committed to cutting out carbs long-term.

### **2.Smoothie Diet vs. Intermittent Fasting**

- With **intermittent fasting**, you cycle between periods of eating and fasting. This plan doesn’t restrict what you eat but focuses on **when** you eat.
- The **Smoothie Diet** is more about **calorie control** and eating nutrient-packed smoothies instead of regular meals.
- If you struggle with long fasting windows, the **Smoothie Diet** might feel easier, as you’re still getting multiple meals throughout the day, albeit in smoothie form.

### **3.Smoothie Diet vs. Low-Carb**

- The **low-carb diet** focuses on cutting carbs like bread, pasta, and sugary foods. While the **Smoothie Diet** encourages fruit-based smoothies, which contain natural sugars, the low-carb diet restricts most carbs, even fruits.
- If you enjoy fruits and want an easier, **nutrient-dense diet**, the Smoothie Diet could be more enjoyable, though low-carb may lead to faster **weight loss** for those who want to minimize carbs.

## Smoothie Diet vs other similar diets

### **1\. Smoothie Diet vs. Juice Cleanse**

The **Smoothie Diet** and **juice cleanses** both focus on liquid meals to promote weight loss, detox, and an increase in nutrient intake. However, there are key differences:

- **Meal Composition**: Smoothies contain whole fruits and vegetables, including fiber, whereas juices remove most of the fiber during extraction. Fiber is essential for digestion and helps you feel full, making smoothies more **filling** and sustainable in the short term.
- **Satiety**: With the Smoothie Diet, you're more likely to stay full longer because the smoothies retain fiber and can include healthy fats and protein (like seeds, nuts, and yogurt). Juice cleanses, by comparison, tend to leave people feeling hungry since they’re mostly liquid calories with no fiber to slow digestion.
- **Duration**: Juice cleanses are typically done over short periods (1-7 days), while the Smoothie Diet is designed to last for **21 days**, making it a bit more of a **long-term plan** for quick weight loss.

### **2\. Smoothie Diet vs. Meal Replacement Shakes**

Both the **Smoothie Diet** and **meal replacement shake diets** offer quick and easy meal alternatives that aim to control calorie intake, but they differ significantly in quality and content:

- **Ingredients**: Meal replacement shakes are often pre-packaged and contain artificial ingredients or sweeteners, while the Smoothie Diet encourages the use of fresh, whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and natural protein sources. This makes smoothies a more **natural and nutrient-dense option**.
- **Customization**: The Smoothie Diet allows for **personalization** based on your dietary needs (e.g., you can make vegan, keto-friendly, or high-protein smoothies). Meal replacement shakes are typically one-size-fits-all and don’t allow as much flexibility in ingredients.
- **Health Focus**: Smoothies provide a broader range of nutrients, including **antioxidants** and **fiber**, which meal replacement shakes may lack. While both promote **weight loss**, smoothies are generally seen as a healthier, more holistic approach.

### **3\. Smoothie Diet vs. Raw Food Diet**

The **Raw Food Diet** and the **Smoothie Diet** both emphasize whole, unprocessed foods, but there are notable differences in how they're structured:

- **Food Variety**: The Raw Food Diet involves eating all foods raw (or slightly warmed) to retain their natural enzymes and nutrients. This includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and raw dairy products. In contrast, the Smoothie Diet centers specifically around **smoothies** as meal replacements, meaning you’re still blending your food, but you’re not restricted to raw-only ingredients.
- **Complexity**: The Raw Food Diet can be quite restrictive and challenging to maintain because it limits you to only raw foods. The Smoothie Diet is more **flexible**, allowing for one solid meal per day and the ability to cook or prepare foods beyond just smoothies, which makes it easier to stick with for people with busy lifestyles.
- **Ease of Preparation**: Smoothies are **quick and easy to prepare**, making the Smoothie Diet more convenient than the Raw Food Diet, which can require extensive food prep to create balanced meals without cooking.

### **4\. Smoothie Diet vs. Green Smoothie Cleanse**

The **Green Smoothie Cleanse** is another diet similar to the Smoothie Diet, where the focus is on drinking **green smoothies** made from leafy greens, fruits, and water. Let’s compare:

- **Nutrient Focus**: Both diets promote increased intake of **fruits and vegetables**, but the Green Smoothie Cleanse specifically emphasizes **greens** (like spinach, kale, and chard) as the main component. The Smoothie Diet, on the other hand, includes a broader range of ingredients, such as healthy fats and proteins, in addition to leafy greens.
- **Duration and Flexibility**: The Green Smoothie Cleanse is typically a **short-term detox**, lasting around 10 days, whereas the Smoothie Diet is a **21-day plan** with the option to continue with healthy habits beyond the program. The Smoothie Diet also allows for more flexibility in ingredients, making it easier to customize and stick with for a longer period.
- **Weight Loss**: Both plans aim for **quick weight loss**, but the Green Smoothie Cleanse is more of a detox, with a primary focus on flushing out toxins and improving digestion. The Smoothie Diet combines weight loss with **overall nutritional balance**, making it more suited for sustained health goals.

## My final Performance Evaluation (Ratings)

### **1\. Appetite Suppression: 3/5**

Smoothies can help with **appetite suppression** due to the fiber content, especially if they include ingredients like chia seeds or oats. However, since liquid meals digest quicker than solid food, some users may feel hungry shortly after consuming a smoothie, limiting its long-term appetite suppression.

### **2\. Metabolism Boost: 3/5**

While the diet does not specifically target metabolism, certain ingredients commonly used in smoothies (like green tea, ginger, and protein-rich add-ins) may provide a slight **boost in metabolism**. However, the overall impact on metabolism is moderate, as it's mostly tied to the calorie deficit rather than metabolic stimulation.

### **3\. Energy Enhancement: 4/5**

The Smoothie Diet scores well in **energy enhancement**, especially when smoothies are loaded with **vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants** from fresh fruits and vegetables. The natural sugars in fruits can provide a quick energy boost, though it may not last long without a balanced intake of proteins and fats.

### **4\. Stimulant-like Effects: 2/5**

The Smoothie Diet doesn't have strong **stimulant-like effects**, as it's based on natural ingredients without the addition of caffeine or other stimulants. Unless you add caffeine-rich ingredients like matcha or green tea powder, don’t expect the ""buzz"" associated with stimulant-based diets.

### **5\. Fat Burning: 3/5**

The **calorie deficit** created by replacing meals with smoothies can lead to **fat burning** over time, but it’s more about the total calorie reduction rather than specific fat-burning ingredients. Adding **protein** and **healthy fats** can help with fat loss, but the effect is moderate without exercise.

### **6\. Safety Profile: 4/5**

The Smoothie Diet is generally safe for short-term use, especially since it focuses on **whole, natural foods**. However, prolonged use may lead to **nutritional imbalances**, particularly if the diet lacks enough protein, fats, or key vitamins. It’s important to keep it as a short-term diet or supplement it with a balanced meal plan.

### **7\. Price/Value for Money: 3/5**

The cost of ingredients (especially fresh produce, superfoods, and protein powders) can add up, making the **Smoothie Diet** relatively expensive, depending on what you include in your smoothies. However, considering that you’re replacing two meals per day, it can offer decent **value for money** compared to dining out, though it's not necessarily budget-friendly long term.

## Downsides and Risks of the Smoothie Diet

### **1\. May cause nutritional Imbalance**

One of the main concerns with the Smoothie Diet is the **risk** of **nutritional deficiencies**. While smoothies can be packed with vitamins and minerals, they might not provide enough of the **essential nutrients** your body needs, especially protein and healthy fats.

If your smoothies are mostly fruits and veggies, you could end up missing out on these critical macronutrients, which are necessary for muscle maintenance and overall health.

### **2\. Short-Term Results**

If you're hoping for long-term weight loss, the **Smoothie Diet** may not be the best solution. Many people experience **quick weight loss** due to the calorie deficit, but once you go back to eating regular meals, you could regain the weight.

This diet isn't designed to be a permanent solution, and the weight loss you achieve may be difficult to maintain once the diet ends. It’s a classic case of the **yo-yo dieting** effect.

### **3\. High Sugar Content**

While smoothies are healthy, they can also be high in **sugar**, especially if you're using a lot of fruits or store-bought juice. Even natural sugars can spike your **blood sugar levels**, which could lead to energy crashes later on. For those with insulin resistance or diabetes, this can be a major concern.

### **4\. Hunger and Lack of Satisfaction**

Let’s be honest—drinking your meals isn't always satisfying. Since you're consuming **liquid calories**, you might find that you’re still hungry after your smoothie or experience cravings for solid foods.

**5\. Potential Cost**

Smoothie ingredients, especially if you’re using **organic produce, superfoods**, and protein powders, can add up. While it’s cheaper than eating out all the time, the cost of buying fresh ingredients regularly can make this diet pricey for some.

We successfully defended our final research 2 days ago. It was very memorable, but it was short-lived, at least for me. The same night, I experienced a variety of symptoms all at once and then collapsed. Nagising na lang ako with my mother on my bedside the next day. 

Long story short, I was diagnosed with a rare condition with no known cure at the moment. When the doctor told me that it'll progress sooner or later, my world slowly crumbled apart. 

Hindi sapat ang salitang takot para i-describe tong nararamdaman ko. Ganito pala kapag alam mo na yung oras mo. Every passing day feels like a ticking time bomb.

Nakapasok ako sa isang prestigious university as a scholar, habang pinagsasabay ko sa pagiging helper boy in a local coffee shop and bakery. Mahirap lang kami, but I persevered because I have bigger dreams for myself and for my family. Ngayon, di ko na alam. Isang sem na lang next year para maka-graduate, pero di ko alam kung may point pa ba lahat ng gagawin ko from this day onward. 

I never stopped asking God bakit ako ang napili niya at hindi yung mga corrupt na pulitiko. Wala naman akong sinaktan at ninakaw na pera sa iba. Nag-promise na ako kay Mama before na bibilhan ko pa siya ng magandang washing machine sa first paycheck ko after graduation. Hindi ako nakaranas ng masayang childhood, kaya sabi ko babawi ako pagtanda and in sudden turns of events, hindi na mangyayari yon.

Gusto ko pang makaranas ng birthday party. Gusto ko pang makakain ng steak o kaya makapasyal sa theme park. Gusto ko pang makita na maka-graduate ang mga kapatid ko. Gusto ko pang tumanda at maranasan ang mundo, pero hanggang sana na lang lahat. Ang dami ko pang gustong gawin, pero limitado na ang buhay ko. Natatakot akong mawala, dahil maiiwan ko si mama at mga kapatid ko. 

I feel robbed, kasi I won't live long enough to reap the rewards of all my hard work and sacrifices. Siguro tatanggapin ko na lang na in my final months, I will disappear without reaching the dreams I envisioned since I was a kid. 

Ma, alam kong hindi mo mababasa to, but I feel like a failure and a huge disappointment, kasi hindi ko na maibibigay yung buhay na deserve mo. Sorry Ma, dahil pabigat na ako sayo, iiwanan pa kita ng problema sa pera kahit wala na ako. 

If I were to become a guardian angel, I will protect you. If reincarnation is real, I will find and help you again. If the afterlife's out there, I will wait for you. Nagsisisi akong hindi ko binigyang halaga ang lahat ng oras na kasama ka. This upcoming Christmas will be my last one, and hindi ko pa rin nasasabi kung gaano ka ka-importante sa akin. The least I can do now is to fight 'til the end, not for myself, but for you.

About me: 
- 28 years old
- 6 ft tall
- halfie 🇺🇸 🇵🇭 
- average-to-fit body type (SFW/wholesome pics on my profile!)
- big fan of good coffee shops, fantasy books, live music, and silly questions like this

Anyway! I know that consensus is that performance generally matters more than size. But when people do talk about size, it seems like they're usually asking about length. Despite that, I have also heard people say that the girth is important, too!  

So I'm just wondering if there is any agreement on this. In your opinion, which is more important in bed? Is length better than girth, or does girth matter more than length? And why?  

I think it would be interesting to learn what different people think about this! So if you want to share your opinion, feel free to message on here.  ",2,1733563037.0,PHR4Rhookups,0,1.0,False

1h8oqwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1h8oqwg/simple_living/,Simple living=❤️,"I've wanted to answer to the guy or girl who wrote big shout-out to everyone but i think i can just post into this sub 🌞

Choosing a simple life has a profound effect over the long term.
Living a simple life is not always easy. We live in a world where unhealthy and consumer-driven lifestyles are considered ""normal."" People may even laugh at us ""simple lifestylers"" because we choose what is better, not what is popular.

Even if we make mistakes, that's okay because we are humans. What is important is the next step. After failure, there is always room to correct those mistakes, learn from them, and forgive yourself.

As I said at the beginning, choosing a simple life will not show its benefits in a day or a week. But if you choose a simple lifestyle, I can guarantee you will be happier, more grateful, and more content with yourself over time.

How can I be so sure? Well, I used to be very popular among my peers and had a lot of friends. We partied a lot, hung out constantly, and I owned plenty of ""stuff"" — dirt bikes, motorcycles, quads, you name it. But as the years went by, I felt more and more ""off.""

One day, a girl told me, ""I wish I had your life. You have it all."" And all I could think was, ""Well, I wish I had yours — peaceful.""

That moment was a turning point. I completely changed my lifestyle, incorporating meditation, home exercises, and healthy eating habits. As a man, I lost over 30 kg, and now my body looks amazing. More importantly, I live in peace. No Saturday or Sunday hangovers, no headaches, no constant rush.

These days, I wake up, do some cardio, take a shower, and enjoy watching birds on my balcony while drinking coffee. There's truly no better feeling than that.

Of course, it’s hard sometimes when someone calls and says, ""Hey, mate, let’s get wasted,"" and I have to say, ""No thanks."" It’s not always easy. But I’ve realized it’s much easier to endure an hour or two of ""hard mode"" than to lose several days — not to mention the money.

Sorry for the long post; I’m just chilling on my balcony🌞

Simple living is the best!

**I am frustrated with my doctors accepting my state and  with my health. Annoyed being stuck in this hamster wheel of taking supplements and not seeing any real improvements.** 

I have functional anemia due to chronic inflammation of unknown origin. If we knew what caused it, maybe i wouldnt have all the other issues but we dont...  
  
My body is doing the thing it does during inflammation, and putting iron into storage instead of having it easily accessible. So i like have ferritin but i dont have active/available iron. Thats the way i understand it (you re welcome to correct me)

  
I feel like my docs dont take me seriously. I got a bunch of parameters that arent great (TSH, cortisol, insuline, lactate, inflammatory markers (CRP, leukos)), and im sure each one is another piece making me feel poorly. But is that a reason to just say ""take supplements its fine""?  
  
Nevermind the physiological cascades that iron may need to be involved it, but isnt since its not available. I have migraines, headaches and fatigue. And while other things contribute, i DID feel better after the iron infusion. Only for about two-three weeks tho 

The same cannot be said about the supplements.  
I been told to take supplements for years. And i do take them for months before i get fed up with it. I dont feel much better either. If it helps then so slowly that its not noticeable to me.

  
I dont know how other people do it, and **advice is welcomed**, but its so annoying to take them. They dont really improve my labs either. Its like a drop of water in the ocean (labs below to illustrate my point).

I need to eat, then wait 4h before taking the pills. So basically eat, then dont eat for 8h. If I break the rule my stomach and  guts will repay with unholy cramps.   
  
So while ideally I would like to eat it before bed and just fast 8h... but who is gonna set an alarm after 4h to take a pill??? Therefore i settle for mornings. But I dont usually eat breakfast, so when i take iron i also have to force myself to eat breakfast (and contribute time to this action).   
However, all my fav breakfasts contain dairy, which im supposed to avoid together with coffee. I would be ok to skip caffeine but i truly miss milk baverages.  I been told dairy is ok-ish but milk is to be avoided. And that truly does put a dent on my mood. Of course i want my guts to uptake the supplements the best possible way but it just feels like it doesnt even matter ??

  
I was told that even the infusion didnt really do as much as they expected?  
 The docs kept looking at my labs and saying ""see the supplements helped"" but it was an infusion!   
And when i tell them i had an infusion they tell me i have to be mistaken.  
  
HOW do you mistake having an IV in your arm??  
I have this iron deficiency since 2016 !!! I am tired of this back and forth.  
Here is an exampe of  this year. Just a disclaimer, I am aware my labs arent super dangerously low to begin with, but clearly they arent good either.

It feels like fighting windmills!  
The infusion made me feel better for a few weeks. My labs did improve slightly but not even 6 months after im told to take supplements again. So my bloodwork clearly isnt fixed.  
   
And then doctors say ""Oh you re in the fertile phase, due to you having periods, having a bit lower parameters is expected"". I do NOT have periods, so no it is not ""fine"" to claim its low because of periods. I told every doctor i no longer have periods and they still write into my chart stupid stuff like "" low iron is likely due to menstruation"" 

I was told i can only get iron infusions every 6-9months, and that my labs arent bad enough to justify another infusion. So yet again im told to take 100mg Iron. I dont feel any better taking supplements and its just beyond annoying. But i dont want to be a disobedient patient, and i dont want to feel even worse. So i PAY for yet another blister of iron and suffer for another 3-6months. 

Just give me infusions, like a ton of them!!! Like several infusions in a row.   
Otherwise i dont see how we re remotely supposed to push up the parameters.   
I appreciate advice but mostly i just wanted to vent to someone who gets it, because i dont feel like my doctors really do get how annoying this is. ",2,1733561607.0,Anemic,0,1.0,False

For reference, it's coffee grinds, vanilla (earthy not sweet), vetiver and coriander seed. It's a combination that's the only coffee scent I'd ever wear, probably daily. Id love to know if anyone has seen a scent in this realm or knows houses who take customs who you think would do a great job at a truly earthy coffee scent!

1h8obx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/bartenders/comments/1h8obx4/my_manager_asked_me_to_strain_the_fruit_flies_out/,My manager asked me to strain the fruit flies out of the liquor tonight. ,"I’ve only been working here for a couple weeks. We have really stupid cheap liquor spouts that let EVERY fruit fly in. We keep the cap on most bottles but the really sugary liquors with spouts (crème de cacao, melon, banana etc) had a decent collection of extra protein floating in them.

Asked manager what to do as we had a party tonight and I knew people would want some fancy shots. He told me to use a coffee filter to strain out the bugs.

I started doing it, got partway through one bottle and was so disgusted with myself that I just hid all the fruit-fly-infested liquors under the bar so no one could have the option to even order them. No China Whites, no King Kongs, I refused to serve those liquors.

I suggested some better fly-preventing spouts to my manager ($20 on amazon for a pack of 6) and he pretty much dismissed me in a very annoyed fashion. It’s an extremely small, rural backwoods town so there aren’t a lot of jobs available, so quitting this one would be rough on me, but I feel so gross about this. I can’t serve anyone something I wouldn’t drink myself. 

I think this is more a rant than anything because I’m frustrated as heck, but does anyone have a similar experience? How did you handle it?

I’m thinking of either having a serious conversation with the manager (who is very grumpy and insists on every money-saving tactic, so I don’t think he’d be okay with me refusing to serve those) or just straight up quitting (which I can’t really do unless I have another job lined up). I’ll figure it out soon but I just can’t serve drinks with dead animals marinating in them. 

ETA, from Google’s AI: “Fruit flies can carry bacteria like salmonella, E. coli, and listeria, which can cause food poisoning. Fruit flies can lay their eggs in ripening fruit and sweet fermenting liquids, like open liquor bottles. The larvae will feed on the overripe food or sugary liquids once they hatch.” ",11,1733560865.0,bartenders,29,0.87,False

Some might say, “Maybe they’re just asking out of curiosity.” No, they’re not. It’s never that. You know it. I know it. The moment that question drops, the energy in the room shifts from ""Oh, this is nice"" to ""Ah, so we’re doing this today?""
