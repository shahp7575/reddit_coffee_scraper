When i drink i cant stop, 1 pot turns into 2, or 3. Then i feel on edge, unable to relax, exhausted and fragile at the same time. I even get manic. I hate this feeling. 

But even though ive written these effects down countless times in my journal, in the morning i seem to forget all of it and it seems like a great idea to drink coffee.

I think its to do with my depression and lethargy, and wanting to counteract that feeling and feel energized.

I have a history of addiction and even psychosis, so its actually dangerous for me. (Thankfully i have sleep medication on hand so psychosis is less of a danger)

I quit weed and alcohol but for some reason that was way easier than coffee... 

I get that i should look for different activities to feel energized, (honoring the role it plays in my life in different ways) and once ive built routine in these things the need for coffee will fall away, but in the morning this awareness/insight is just not there.. idk how to approach this

1izghs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1izghs0/m27_feeling_guilty_for_leaving_f29/,M27 Feeling guilty for leaving F29,"TLDR : I love my F29 girlfriend but her adhd makes her a low functioning adult. Also her 2 dogs are causing a strain on our relationship (they’re destructive towards our house and keep running away). Is my unhappiness and my leaving her justified ?

I met my girlfriend ( F 29) in fall of 2023, im M 27. We had a good start to our relationship because we connected on an emotional level and we both felt like we could be open with each other and not judge each other, i also valued her alot because it seemed like she had an honest heart and really valued loyalty which i do too. When i first met her she seemed really down on her luck (fired from a good restaurant serving job) which ultimately hurt her financially and she had to find another serving job and also work another part time job at a coffee shop to make ends meet. She also lived by herself in a ghetto area studio apartment with her two dogs (outdoor breeds : husky and aussie). I on the other hand dont claim to be doing super fantastic in life but i have a stable full time factory job with full benefits and good job security. I was living at home with my parents at the time because i honestly have a good relationship with them and dont see the need to live by myself if i dont have to. It’s also important to note that she didnt even have a operational car at the time (both her jobs were walking distance) when meeting her but i didnt mind any of this because we had a good connection. Anyways.. (i met her as my server) asked her out and all is really good in the beginning. I never judged her for struggling at the time because like i said we had a good emotional connection. It’s also important to note that she has bad connections with her mom and her dad had passed away, so she’s not to close to family. Anyways im getting kind of tired of living at home and also she’s getting a notice that she’s getting evicted from her apartment because she was behind on payments (first redflag i stupidly ignored). Coincidentally a good friend of mine has the house next door to him on the market soon (his boss’ rental) and he extends the offer to me. As kind of a solution to both our problems i suggest moving in at January of 2024. We both only after a couple months of knowing each other move in. It was a nice and newly renovated house in a nice and quiet tiny town outside of the major city we live in (15 mins away) 3 bedroom 2 bathroom with a backyard and everything affordable and cheaper than her studio was if we split it which we did. Anyways after a few months i start noticing how much her adhd has a strain on her and she struggles with organizational tasks and keeping things clean. It’s needlessly messy alot of the times. And if we do clean everything, then it’s literally a mess again a week later if not 2 at the max. That alongside her dogs (which i dont think she should even have ,and dont even know how she managed to have those 2 specific breeds in a tiny studio apartment) being very destructive to our backyard and constantly escape. I was under the impression that the backyard would solve all the issues and we even went to the extent to buy 2 nice dog houses that they dont even use. So now instead they stay in a spare room that theyve damaged some of the carpet, blinds, and not to mention there’s hair everywhere. My girlfriend and her dogs totally disrespect that room ( she smokes her weed inside that room and it’s disgusting looking and smelling). Whenever i tell her the way she treats the room bothers me, she brushes me off and tells me not to tell her what to do and that she’ll get to it (which she never has and will). Her life has improved since she met me though, she has a newer functional car and she got a new full time job as a teachers assistant and also part time job as the bartender down the street but she still manages to have money it seems like. I on the other hand and almost done with my online school and will have my bachelors degree in a few months. Ive tried to tell her to do online school with me but she seems uninterested. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even respect her anymore because the dog situation, her adhd, and her willingness to level up in life and she just wants to fight me on everything. I’ve officially decided to move out in a few weeks and i feel terrible because ive given up on her. Any feedback would be appreciated as to what they think about the situation. I just wish she would get on some adhd medication and she could function normally as an adult. ",1,1740664997.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

On that day, me and my husband got busy with our schedule and were late for the gym (that we planned to go to) as it would be closed after they arrived. 

We had 1 hour, so I kindly asked him to agree on a maximum amount of time to spend in the gym. He refused because ""he doesn't want his time to depend on someone else."" I said I just wanted to get back with enough time to shower, and he suggested that I should've messaged them to say I might be late.

I don't think it's fair, as they would have to drive at least 1 hour to come to meet us and they already said when they would come and I agreed with it. 

I tried to ask him to get back on time, as I really wanted him to meet them, as he hardly interacts with my social circle, and they are important to me. His answer was, ""It's always important to you; I'm not sure I'll get back on time; I'll do my workout calmly and get back."" 

When he got back, he didn't greet me and got into the shower. When my friends arrived, they invited us to a coffee, and I went to speak with him about that; he got defensive again, asking If I would rush him again because of them, but ""he was asking nicely,"" as he said, to what I thought it was extremely passive aggressive. He said he wouldn't come with us, as he had a headache, just said hi to them, and we left.

He hardly spoke with me the next few days; I tried to get close to him, and he got better during lunch, but after work, he was grumpy and distant again, and I simply gave up initiating contact. 


Just a note: he agreed to meet them. And I expressed how excited I was about it.

1izgcyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1izgcyx/ranking_15_nyc_chocolate_chip_cookies/,Ranking 15 NYC Chocolate Chip Cookies,"I went on a journey recently to try to find who makes the best chocolate chip cookie in NYC for a video/live stream and used a bunch of places mentioned a lot on reddit. Wanted to share my results here noting that I discovered through this process that I prefer cookies that are thinner with chew to it and a fair balance of chocolate to dough. I don't really like the mouthfeel of the thick cookies with loads of rich amounts of chocolate, and I kinda figure that if I wanted that much chocolate, I would just get a chocolate bar

1. **Maman** \- It was literally glistening when I had it, and for my tastes it hit all the marks pretty perfectly. I just thought it was wonderfully balanced and had a balance of chew to caramelized bottom that hit the spot for my tastes in a chocolate chip cookie
2. **Mah-Ze-Dahr** \- similar to Maman, I found the balance of this cookie very good and really appreciated the flake salt that they put on top. Also one of the more affordable cookies on the list at $2.50
3. **Culture Espresso** \- If you like chocolate, this is your cookie. I can see why a lot of people put this at the top of their ranking, but for me this is just too much chocolate. I can tell that it's high quality, but a little too rich for me
4. **Yanni's Coffee** \- They make a chocolate chip walnut cookie clearly inspired by Levain. They succeeded at making a better product.
5. **Dominique Ansel Bakery** \- A nice cookie, but the only criticism I have is that it is a bit light in color for me. The chocolate chip cookie shot glass is a better all around experience than the regular cookie to me.
6. **Daily Provisions** \- This one has caramel bits, but the overall composition of this cookie is solid. I think the caramel adds to the overall cookie, but it isn't totally the classic chocolate chip cookie experience you may be looking for. Also maybe a bit too rich for me to be able to take down a full cookie
7. **Levain Cookies** \- There's still something a little special about this cookie. It looks distinctive but it is ultimately a bit too sweet and rich for my tastes. I think the walnuts do a lot to lighten the load of this overall, but the copycat Yanni's did a better job at this format.
8. **Gooey on the Inside** \- Originally I thought this was one of the better of the thick cookies, but the $8.15 price tag made me bring it down a notch, and, like all the very thick cookies, was a *little* raw feeling on the inside
9. **Seven Grams Caffe** \- Comparable to the other thick cookies. Similarly too thick, too rich, too much chocolate for me. This one was a bit softer than others which rank higher but in a way that collapses. I prefer a bit more body, but with such a thick cookie, it's hard to manage.
10. **Janie's Life Changing Baked Goods** \- This is, on paper, everything I like in a cookie, but something about it was a little underwhelming when I had it. Maybe it suffered from the aftertaste of having a milk bar cookie prior to this
11. **Costco Wholesale Food Court** \- Honestly pretty solid, but NYC Costcos are pretty nightmareish environments. Cookie is good tho. Thick, chunky. In my opinion, it's a little too sweet.
12. **Crumbl** \- Honestly, I liked this one, and it was the first cookie I've ever gotten from crumbl. I got there at a time where there wasn't really a wait or a crowd, and don't think the hype is deserved, but... it was a good version of a chocolate chip cookie, even
13. **Chip City** \- The Chip City cookie is the type of decadence that is crafted only in the embers of a dying empire. It is crafted by the minds of hyperefficiency turned cannabilistic. It is the cookie analogue of ""what if we made the entire plane out of the black box"". As a thick chocolate chip cookie, everything about it is too much. Too sweet, too thick, too rich. I did not enjoy eating this, and I could not fathom eating an entire cookie as a single person unless I were substituting it for a full meal.
14. **Insomnia Cookies** \- A bit average. It's a very available cookie.
15. **Milk Bar** \- Christina Tosi you should be disappointed. This was as bad as a run-of-the-mill nestle cookie if not worse. It was pre-packaged and warmed up in the oven but even that could not put enough lipstick on this pig of a cookie that is nearly $6!

Appendix: I recently went to Jacque Torres and was a pretty big fan. I think there could be a bit more color on the bottom, but it was a pretty good match for my palate. I would rank it higher than Dominique Ansel probably, but as I had the other cookies on the same day, I didn't think it appropriate to rank as it was eaten in different context more casually.

I 21F have been friends with ""Ben"" 23M since highschool and am best friends with his sister 21F. Their family had been my second family for the past 6 years, I've gone on family vacation met both sides grandparents and uncles/aunts. The grandparents call me their adopted granddaughter. 
I have never had any romantic feelings and entanglements with Ben. We would rather hangout with out his sister around. Out relationship has ALWAYS been strictly brother/sister. We stayed friends while both being in long-term relationships. 

I am now married to my 24M Husband and we are expecting a baby girl this summer. My husband has met Ben and has never had an issue with our very platonic friendship. Ben has never caused any issues in our relationship. Ben and I talked about our friendship and what boundaries should be in place before I married my husband and we were all good. 
Ben has been a very important person in my life and was a big help to me quitting vaping while my husband was away at military camp. I always have held my friendship with Ben and his family in an extremely high regard considering how they have treated me. 

Recently I connected with a girl at a Bible study ""Ali"" 26F and we were in the in the beginning stages of getting to know eachother. ""Ben"" was single and had been asking me if I could set him up with a nice girl. I love matchmaking and was totally up for the challenge. Ben had invited me to a lake day with his church and friends one day. I happened to be hanging with Ali before the event and her evening plans fell through. Ben had see her at other church events and told me he thought she was cute but hadn't connected with her so far. Ali had also told me she thought Ben was cute so I was willing to put them in the same environment to see if they clicked. 
I didn't know Ali very well and had see her with her ex bf 22M in the past and she seemed kinda controling, but I didn't know her at the time so didn't really say anything. 

Ben and Ali his it off and begin dating officially right before my wedding. I invited them to the wedding and my friendship with Ali quickly faded away as she was focused on het love story. We would only get coffee once every few months when I reached out. 
I found out I was pregnant a few days before my wedding and was super scared of having a miscarriage so was only telling very close friends and family while in the danger zone. Ben was a close friend that I told and I waited a week after I told him to tell Ali. All I said to Ben was pls don't mention this to Ali until I can tell her myself. A week later I told Ali and she said "" oh so that's what crawled up your ass""
This really showed me her true colours and I was not interested in continuing to grow our friendship. Ali ended up telling ppl that I told her bf to lie to her. They had been dating for about 1month.

Fast forward to 5 months pregnant about 6 months of them dating. I was throwing a very intimate gender reveal party with mostly family and a few friends an hour outside of town because we were blowing things up. I invited Ben and didn't specifically mention Ali, he asked if she could come and I said sure as I know how much he likes her, but I didn't want to invite her without him. Ben got really weird about me inviting him and not specifically mentioning Ali as well. I had gotten coffee with Ali the Wednesday before my gender reveal which was on the Saturday. Not once during the hangout did she ask me about my pregnancy. Ali just complaint about how difficult it was to be with Ben the entire time. 

Ben said he thought I was being weird and disrespectful to Ali for not inviting her to my gender reveal. I said sorry for not thinking about specifically inviting her since it was obviously important to him. Later I get a big ass paragraph text from Ben saying that our friendship was inappropriate and disrespectful to Ali, my Husband, and God. And mostly that we can't ever check in/ text eachother again, I can never invite him anywhere without specially inviting Ali and should only talk/catch up with him if we ""happen to see eachother at a church event or when I'm hanging out with his sister"" this caught me off guard and hurt me to my core. 

All I said over text was that I appreciate him sharing his feelings but this really sounds like a conversation to have in person. He agreed and I asked that Ali be separate from the conversation so I'm not being attacked by two people and can talk to him freely. I have been ghosted now for the past month. 

Obviously I'm still hurt bad and confused any words of wisdom pls help!? Am I being crazy / inconsiderate here? ",1,1740664242.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Aarav stares at the ceiling, eyes heavy with exhaustion. The clock ticks louder than usual. He has exactly 45 minutes before the chaos begins. Emails. Meetings. Deadlines.

He pulls himself out of bed, dragging his feet toward the bathroom. The cold splash of water on his face does little to wake him up. His body moves on autopilot—the same routine, the same rush. Breakfast? Just a bite of toast. Coffee? A necessity, not a luxury.

By 8:00 AM, Aarav is already trapped in the city's traffic, bumper-to-bumper with hundreds of others chasing the same routine. The honking horns echo the chaos inside his head. Another day of endless spreadsheets and pointless presentations awaits.

**""Is this it?""** he whispers to himself, gripping the steering wheel tighter.

At 9:15 AM, he slides into his office chair. A pile of emails flood his inbox—half of them marked ""urgent."" His heart sinks. Another eight hours of pretending to care, of plastering a polite smile while his dreams gather dust.

The fluorescent lights buzz overhead. Time moves painfully slow. Lunch breaks feel like a prison yard stroll. By 3:00 PM, his energy drains. He scrolls through social media, envying those who dared to escape this cycle. Digital nomads working by the beach. Entrepreneurs living life on their terms. **""Why not me?""**

By 6:30 PM, Aarav shuts his laptop. But the work never really ends. His phone hums with after-hour requests. ""Just one more thing,"" his boss says casually. The promise of a quiet evening slips away.

At home, dinner feels like a chore. Conversations with his family are brief—he’s too tired to engage. The couch calls him, but so does his inbox. Sleep? That’s a luxury saved for weekends.

And even weekends? They flash by in a blur of errands and unfinished work. The freedom he craves always seems just out of reach.

**But deep down, something stirs.**

Aarav wants more. More than just paying bills and counting days until Friday. He dreams of waking up without an alarm. Of pursuing his passion. Of breaking free.

He wonders what it would be like to work on something that excites him. To create. To build. To live life on his own terms.

And maybe, just maybe, he's ready to take the first step.

Because life shouldn’t just be about surviving the weekdays—it should be about **living** every day.

1izg4yz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1izg4yz/lauren_in_heat_1995/,Lauren in Heat (1995),"I love her character in the movie and I've compiled a bunch of notes I took on her. There is no grand conclusion, and these are notes so not always well written and sometimes repetitive. I don't have the heart/energy/time to clean them up but I still thought they could be interesting. Sorry for any typos.

Some stuff I say below I won't explain in the post because it would be too long and it's not directly linked to Lauren, I'll mark them with \* - feel free to ask me to explain in the comments.

Before anyone asks: yes Heat 2 exists, it is a book and both a prequel and a sequel. I'll spoil some details of it.

# 1. Lauren to Vincent

In Lauren’s first scene:

* Vincent only comes out of the dressing room/bathroom (the room that has a *mirror* that he was looking at) when Lauren arrives. When she leaves, he goes back briefly in the dressing room and immediately leaves the scene entirely.
* The only character he actually looks at intently in the scene is Lauren. He only ever briefly glances at Justine.
* The only moment in the scene when he is still is when he is looking at Lauren.
* Justine tries to have a conversation with him, but he ignores her question and instead goes to talk to and look at Lauren.
* His only smile in the scene is directed at Lauren.
* He’s “out of time” for Justine but has the time to stare at Lauren.
* He didn’t know what she had planned for the day.

When Vincent comes home late at night:

* Vincent’s only questions are about Lauren. He does not ask about Justine’s day.
* His first actual contribution to the conversation with Justine is a question about Lauren.
* When Justine tries to steer the conversation back to them, Vincent ignores that and asks again about Lauren. It’s so weird that even Justine makes a weird face about it, as in “how dare you be so concerned about my kid when you so don’t care about me?”
* As soon as the conversation effectively goes back to Justine and Vincent, he’s pissed.

When Lauren is outside:

* Vincent is out with Bosko, so he’s at work, yet he does not hesitate one second to (have Bosko) pull over and bring Lauren home.

When he comes home to Justine and Ralph:

* His very first question is to ask where Lauren is.

In the hotel room scene:

* Vincent is the most frantic he’s ever been in the entire movie.
* Vincent calls her “baby” (a lot), when it was always “sweetie” before, twice. Justine was “baby”.

He clearly cares more about Lauren than about Justine/his relationship with Justine. Somewhat logical since Lauren is linked to Neil in many ways. It goes as far as this: in her first scene, Lauren wears a shirt that has the exact same colors and pattern as the lights behind Neil in the coffee shop scene. It means that in arguably the most important scene of the movie, Vincent’s view is: foreground, Neil, background, Lauren. Foreground, professional sphere, background, personal sphere; it is undeniable he cares first and foremost about Neil, however it’s interesting that the representation for the personal sphere is Lauren, not Justine. He cares more about Lauren than about Justine, so much more he picks Lauren before work (when she is outside on the bench) which he never does for Justine. Then, when Lauren is in the hospital, he picks Neil. So the hierarchy is Neil > Lauren > Work > Justine. (In Heat 2, he thinks about Justine once. He thinks about Lauren and calls her, twice. He thinks about Neil a lot. The hierarchy holds.) Despite the fact that she matters a lot to him, he's still not very involved. Doesn't know her day to day, doesn't seem to go see her at the end of the first day, etc.

# 2. Vincent to Lauren

In her first scene:

* The first thing she does is to greet Vincent (before asking about the barrettes which is very important to her).
* She greets Vincent but not her mother (maybe she’s seen her already?)
* Her only smile/excited behavior (in the whole movie) is from a question Vincent asks and is directed at him, although arguably the smile is really about her bio father.

Lauren in the house:

* She has an art project stuck on the kitchen wall of a black suit with no man inside.

When Lauren is outside:

* She wants to be alone but visibly perks up when she spots Vincent’s car and runs to him and gives him a kiss (the most affection we see her display for anyone in the movie).
* She seems to know Mike (Bosko). She knows Vincent’s coworkers. ?

In the hotel room:

* She presumably broke into Vincent’s room and tried to kill herself there, and not at home.
* Later in the hospital Justine says “she chose you \[versus her bio dad\]”.

The art project is telling too: she knows Vincent’s work, his coworkers, his outside persona, but not the man inside. He is all work, he doesn’t actually exist as a man. She knows what he does but not who he is. Still, she loves him.

# 3. Lauren to Justine (and vice versa)

* Justine ignores Lauren in favor of Vincent in their first scene.
* Lauren is visibly disappointed in her and leaves.
* Justine half-assedly answers Lauren in their second scene while staring at her newspaper. She ends up listening to her when Lauren takes her newspaper away.
* Lauren stays in her room all day when her bio dad doesn’t show up. Meaning, she isolated herself. Did she keep even Justine outside?
* Lauren commits suicide in Vincent’s hotel room and not in her mother’s house (also her own house).

# 1-2-3 Conclusion

* Her only smile/excitement in the entire movie is for the father figure: it’s about the bio dad and it’s directed at Vincent.
* Even when she wants to be alone, she runs to Vincent when she sees him.
* She is so devastated by Vincent leaving the family home she follows him into his motel room.
* The trigger for her suicide is Vincent leaving, not her father not showing up.
* In both her scenes with her mother, she feels unheard and neglected, and is disappointed in her mother.

All in all, she is neglected by all 3 of her parental figures. The father is never there, Vincent cares but is half-there, Justine is there but Lauren still feels unheard by her.

# 4. The players (and those who don’t play)

The players are those who accept the rules of the game and start playing. The criminals, first: easy money, against the risk of death or prison. The cops: the power of brutality, manhunting and law enforcement, against the risk of having to participate in WWIII on any given day and/or to be killed on the job. Their partners/wives: they all accept the rules, they all start playing when they choose to get involved with a player.

In Heat, the only two characters who are *not* players are Lauren and Lilian. Eady was not for most of the movie but she ends up becoming a player when she chooses to stay with Neil after learning his true nature. Justine was always a player since she married a cop.

Lauren, however, did not choose to have a cop as a step-father. Lilian chose an ex-con trying to go straight as a partner, so not a player; he became one again unbeknown to her.

(To note: the name Lilian means “purity”. It comes from the lily flower, itself meaning purity, innocence, peace, rebirth. Rebirth like her partner going straight; purity and innocence and peace like her not being a player (and her partner was not supposed to be one either). This name was initially Justine’s name (in LA Takedown). It is clear why it couldn’t actually be her name (and so why it was given to Lilian instead): because by virtue of marrying a player, Justine is not innocent.)

Out of the only two non-players, Vincent only knows Lauren. He might get to know Lilian during his investigation post-movie, but he might consider her a player simply because she got with an ex-con (which is a high risk situation in terms of the game). Therefore, to him, the only real non-player is Lauren: to him, she is an innocent, caught in the crossfire of the game; a pure collateral victim of the players in her life, and that player is VINCENT: he’s the reason Justine turned into a player, although she chose that; he is the reason Lauren is in the game’s crossfire.

# 5. Lauren and the dead girls

Lauren and the teenage prostitute Waingro kills are the only 2 teenage girls in the movie. They are both related to Vincent. It is said that this teenage girl makes it a series, meaning she’s Waingro's third kill. Vincent also has to have other cases and other victims. While the prostitutes are players too (though not with the same status as a cop?), there must be total non-players among those victims/dead teenage girls. They all get investigated by Vincent, and so join his banquet table to haunt him in his sleep. And in Heat 2, both times he calls Lauren, it’s immediately after thinking about a dead girl he’s investigating. Thinking about his victims makes him think about Lauren. The two are linked.

Lauren, if she is 13 like Natalie Portman during the movie’s shooting, was born in 1982. In Heat 2, Sofia was already dead by ‘88 and Vincent already has some distance from it, so she must have died in ‘86 or before. Before her death, she had three miscarriages. Therefore, Vincent’s unborn children would be approximately Lauren’s age, had they lived. Looking at Lauren must remind him of that; his dead kids, and by extension, Sofia’s death and his part in it, meaning his mistakes.

Therefore, for Vincent, Lauren is related to all the dead girls: the victims he investigates (professional sphere) and his unborn children (personal sphere). 

He feels guilt about the unborn children (he feels guilty about Sofia’s death, of which the miscarriages were a factor), he feels guilt about the victims he investigates (they haunt his dreams, he’s supposed to protect them, he feels empathy for the family, he takes the angst in…), he feels guilt because he’s exposing Lauren to the game/his neglect: Lauren is the culmination. He must feel all of that at once when looking at her. She’s the sum total of everything he fucked up in life while being an innocent teenage girl who still loves him.

# 6. Lauren as a reflection of Vincent

* Her name: Lauren comes from laurel, the laurels of victory (Vincent). She is etymologically very closely related to him.
* She grows to want to be outside the home, alone, more than being with her friends or mother. Vincent clearly likes being alone and outside more than being with his wife: the city is his playground, not the home.
* She cares a lot about her own appearance, fidgeting about her barrettes at the same time as Vincent is fidgeting about his tie.
* She somehow figures out how to track down people (manhunting), since she finds Vincent and his hotel room in not even a day, much like Vincent is a manhunter.
* She has a death drive, much like Vincent, who is obsessed with death (who in Heat 2 drives at night with his headlights off just to see what happens).
* She dies in water, in his space, since Death!Vincent is the one navigating the Styx and taking souls to the other side.\*

# 7. Lauren as a reflection of Neil

* Both her last name and Neil’s last name mean “son of…”: they are both defined by their relationship with their father.
* Her father neglected her and abandoned him in her young teenagehood (13 and before). In Heat 2, Neil’s father neglects him and abandons him in his young teenagehood (before 11).
* She wears a shirt with the colors and patterns of the lights behind Neil in the coffee shop.
* Outside, she is separated from nature by a chain-link fence. Neil, outside Kelso’s home, is separated from trees by a chain-link fence. This style of fence is also reminiscent of prison: they are both loners who want out.
* She has abandonment issues (from her father), him too (from his parents and Elisa (from Heat 2)), which show in their joint credo to leave people first in order not to be left: Neil with his 30 second rule, Lauren with her suicide attempt.
* She half breaks into/half sweet-talks (?) her way into a hotel room, by herself, much like Neil does. They both do it with death on their mind (and both break into the room of the same person: (evil!)Vincent\*).

# 8. The baptism

A baptism is:

* A declaration/show of faith by the baptised
* The death of the previous life of the baptised
* A purification of the sins of the baptised
* The rebirth of the baptised as a child of God

Lauren’s suicide attempt is:

* Her choosing Vincent as a father as she chose to die in his space
* Her death and end of her life
* Her being freed from her sins (lack of self-worth = fixed by death, having a bad father = fixed by choosing a new father)
* Her rebirth as Vincent saves her/accepts her as his.

Vincent accepts her as his daughter by calling her “baby”. It’s a parallel to the mother of the dead prostitute, who calls her child her baby, AND Justine who, in the hospital, calls her child her baby. (Another parallel between the teenage prostitute and Lauren.) Vincent calling Lauren “baby” is akin to him claiming her as a daughter and not a step-daughter; it’s a promotion. (It is *also* Vincent replacing Justine with Lauren, or, maybe, his frantic state showing the truth: that his number 1 relationship in the movie is with Lauren, not Justine. This holds into Heat 2.) 

God opened the clouds and talked to Jesus, claiming him, right after his baptism. Similarly, Vincent reaches out to Lauren and claims her right after her baptism.

As Vincent is (the God of) Death\*, Lauren is thus becoming the child of God.

As Vincent is Death\*, the show of faith he needed was not just immersion in water, but death in water, to show that she is unafraid of death, that she welcomes it.

She then becomes pure from the sin of being her biological father’s daughter, thanks to becoming the daughter of a father who is emotionally open to her. 

# 9. Lauren & Vincent

Lauren is clearly neglected by Vincent - he may care about her, but he is still absent. He asks *Justine* how she is, not Lauren. Meanwhile, Lauren obviously reminds Vincent of his dead victims, and of his dead family.

Despite all of this, these two characters never fight, never hold anything against the other. Despite this, when Lauren’s outside, they meet in the wild, in the jungle, and despite Vincent being at work, despite Lauren wanting to be alone, they both go towards each other. Despite this, Lauren still chooses him over her biological father, and Vincent claims her back. Despite this, Lauren kills herself in his motel bathtub, because she is so afraid of his rejection she’s ready to leave first. She wants him to death.

Vincent is attracted to her because she is the only “pure” thing in his life; the only innocent, the only non-player, the only one who did not do anything wrong. She is the epitome of the blameless victim, the people he has sworn to protect.

She is his victims, the dead people that haunt his sleep, that follow him everywhere, the subjects of his kingdom; she is them following him even in waking life. She is his past (his dead children), his present, and his future (a future possible victim).

He is so attached to his work, so incapable to see anything but his work, to interact with the world through any lens but his work lens, that the person he responds to the most in his personal life is Lauren, the person who reminds him of his dead girls.

Lauren attracts him because she is a reflection of himself (in his first scene with her, she’s the only thing that pulls him from the mirror; when he’s home at night, he looks at his reflection on the TV; he spends the movie running after his twin, Neil; Justine and Sofia both look like him) ...as much as she attracts him because she is a reflection of Neil.

He is attracted to her because she is what he knows: an innocent young girl, getting fucked over by the world. As he told Justine: “I told you when we hooked up baby, that you were gonna have to share me with all the bad people and all the ugly events on the planet.” Bad people and ugly events stick together: him and Lauren.

He is blocked off to Justine: he knows he causes her pain, intellectually, but emotionally he’s blocked off and doesn’t take in, has no empathy. “With Sofia I didn’t take anything in.” (Heat 2)

To Lauren, he is open. He takes in her emotions and understands them, he has empathy. Lauren reacts to that, so even though Vincent is only half-there, when he is, she feels heard and seen. With her mother, she feels unheard.

He takes it in with Lauren because he takes it in with his victims. It keeps him sharp, and by association, it happens also with Lauren, pure and akin to his victims. He only reacts to the part of his personal life that reminds him of work.

Because Vincent sees her, she picks him, the adult who seems to care the most. But maybe she feels the only thing he actually responds to is death. Maybe she wanted him so badly she got infected by his illness, death and the death drive.

Either way, at the end of the movie, the only things he has actually responded to, emotionally, are Lauren’s death, held in his arms as she was baptized by death-waters as his daughter, and Neil’s death, as he held the hand of his twin and took in his last heartbeats. 

Maybe at the beginning of the movie he shared himself between his work and Justine (them happily rolling around in bed), but at the end, he only shows commitment to the bad people (Neil) and the ugly events (Lauren). Again, Neil > Lauren > work > Justine.

At the end of the movie, Vincent has been completely overtaken by Death. His professional life: was already all about death and victims and corpses. His dreams: inhabited by dead people. His personal life: Lauren, infected by him, committed suicide and as such has joined the ranks of the innocent victims. Neil, his twin, is dead, and Vincent basically is as well; there is nothing left in his life that is untouched by death.

Okay, now I'm intrigued.","I've never really been one to drink my calories. I drank protein shakes religiously for a long while but did so just because I liked the taste of the protein powders I was getting. I still occasionally mix myself a chocolate peanut butter or fruity cereal protein shake in the AM if I'm craving a cereal flavor. 

But as I've been wrestling with being in and out of ketosis, I decided to start getting more strict on my carb intake and upping my fats. One of the things that crossed my mind as a pure fat addition that would help with energy was MCT oil. And, naturally, bulletproof coffee crossed my mind.

The trouble is, I don't really like coffee. Nor can I deal with the caffeine. But I do like tea, and drink a cup of green or low caffeine chai every day.

So I grabbed some MCT oil yesterday and mixed a teaspoon of it into my normal green tea at work. I just mixed it as vigorously as I could with a spoon.  Nothing special. The energy boost I got was noticeable and it tasted okay. 

Today I took it a step further. Chai tea this time. 1 Tbsp MCT oil. 2 Tbsp almond milk. (No butter because I don't have any at work). I also vigorously shook it in a travel mug to blend it all better.

And now I see what all the fuss is about. It's been 30 minutes since I downed it all basically in a couple gulps because it was so good, and I'm positively bursting with energy. I haven't felt this amount of energy in weeks/months, and I'm so happy to finally get back to this point.

Drinking calories be damned, I might seriously consider replacing at least part of my usual breakfast with bulletproof tea. From this random internet stranger, who's been struggling for weeks trying to find an answer to his depleting energy levels, I want to thank anyone here who's recently mentioned MCT oil or bulletproof coffee/tea. You helped get me to where I needed to go, apparently.",2,1740663951.0,keto,1,1.0,False

1izg3zt,https://i.redd.it/9x4bv0kerole1.jpeg,Review: Woodford Reserve  Distillery Series: Chocolate Whisper Redux Kentucky Straight Bourbon,"Woodford Reserve  Distillery Series: Chocolate Whisper Redux Kentucky Straight Bourbon

Sample provided for review by Woodford Reserve

Release: Feb 20, 2025

Age: 12+ years 

Proof: 139.4 
This serves as Woodford’s highest proof yet!

In 2019, Woodford distilled a bourbon w/ 15% chocolate malted rye in the mashbill. This bourbon is the result of running the standard mashbill through the still immediately after while residual was still in the pot still’s receiving tank from the chocolate malted rye bourbon run.

Mashbill: 72% corn, 18% rye, 10% malted barley 

MSRP: $100 / 375ml

Nose 👃: Roasted coffee beans. Toasted coconut. Cedarwood. Ginger.

Palate 👅: Extra-dark chocolate. Chicory. Cranberry. Ginger. Dense mouthfeel.

Finish 🏁: Caramel. Brown sugar. Butter pecan ice cream. Extremely long finish.

Woodford Reserve came to play! If you’ve been waiting for the “it factor” from Woodford… it has arrived. This bourbon is big and bold. It packs the oak that you would expect for 12 years of age and is nowhere near being over-oaked. 

I think I’m with most people in feeling that Woodford is historically a bit boring. There’s absolutely nothing boring about this. This is undoubtably the best thing I’ve ever tried from Woodford… finally replacing the 2009 Master’s Collection Seasoned Oak in my book.

Given the age, proof, and “whisper”… this is a fantastic purchase if you can find it for MSRP. Absolutely game on.

I bought a new Rancilio Silvia Pro X in April of 2024. I enjoyed the machine but after only a month or two of light use a leak developed in the steam boiler. I thought this would likely be an easy fix and spoke with SCG thinking maybe they could just ship me a part. They said they cannot do that. I let it go until December of 2024 and shipped the machine back on December 9, 2024. It was frustrating that I bought an expensive machine new and after only a few months of ownership I had to (1) be without a machine for a while and (2) pay to have it shipped back, which was around $100. Fast forward to February 4 they told me that they received the replacement part from Rancilio but it was damaged and that they would update me as soon as possible. They issued a $100 gift card for the trouble. Fast forward another 2 weeks and I hadn't heard anything. I asked if they would consider buying the machine back from me so I didn't have to deal with it and they just issued a gift card in the amount of my purchase. The gift cards were a nice gesture however I was out an extra $100 in shipping and without my machine for over 2 months - quite a hassle, and all of this after buying a brand new $2k espresso machine.

Australian author, Jill Bavin-Mizzi claims to have identified Bible John serial killer. The Bible John case is unsolved decades after the women were seized by an unknown attacker after attending dances at the city’s Barrowland Ballroom. Jill Bavin-Mizzi, an Australian writer, has now named a Library Supervisor, John Templeton as the killer of Helen Puttock, the third of the three victims, in her new book on the murders.

Jill’s last hope is that Templeton has a surviving blood relative in England, but ancestry records are much harder to search than in Scotland.

She is now appealing to anyone who believes they may be related to Templeton to come forward and will be in the UK in June for more research and to meet with any relatives then. As part of her research trip to end the mystery once and for all, she will visit Airdrie Library to share her conclusions.

1izfyma,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByMillennial/comments/1izfyma/break_generational_trauma/,Break generational trauma,"As a millennial - raised in a religious home, there was a whole lot of church shoved down my throat from the time I was born until the time I walked away. 

I was and remain a curious human often asking “why” - what’s the “why” behind what we do, how we do it, where we are doing it why we are doing it etc - it helps put a lot of things into perspective and ensures we’re doing things the best way possible. As a child it was more like why - I don’t understand & because I don’t understand I’m not interested. 

That personality trait got my ass beat, a lot. Literally just my ass - I wasn’t hit across the face, or anything like that. 

I had a custom 2x4 with holes in it that spelled “kids” but it may as well have had my name on it since I was the one getting it every other day. 

My siblings used to tell me to be quiet and just do whatever I was told - I didn’t & they did. 

My siblings were very much like my parents & I was unlike the rest in every conceivable way. 

By the time I was in my 20s I had already wanted little to do with any of them really - but I did my part and showed up for family functions and did my part to try and build some semblance of a relationship with all of them. 

I lived 30 minutes away and would drive over almost every other weekend - and in my few years living close to them, they visited me once. 

I moved a few hours away and visits became monthly. And after a while & a whole lot of therapy I realized this was a one sided relationship- nobody else was trying to keep me in the family the way I was trying to stay engaged and build. 

In the course of almost a decade they visited me once while I was going over virtually monthly. 

I reached out to my siblings and had a heart to heart with each of them & asked them why don’t you give me the time I give you - what did I do wrong to not even try? 

I was mostly met with “we’re just busy…”

One sibling went on to attack me for not altering my wedding plans to make it easier for them like they did when they got married and made changes to accommodate their friends - they went on to attack my life, my choices etc. and then went on to tell my other sibling is a liar and that they didn’t like me either and were upset but wouldn’t tell me the truth.

To make a super long and detailed story as short as possible - I ended up writing a ten page later & mailed a copy to each family member - and let them know real facts, that were undeniable - nobody ever countered them or tried to dismiss them - and I just said I’ll match your input - if you visit me I’ll visit you, if you call or text me I’ll call or text you - I’ll meet you where you are at and foster the type of relationship you want. 

I haven’t seen or heard from any of my siblings in 5 years…and after the first year I decided no matter what, there’s no way I’d bring them into the fold ever again.

I cut my parents off for a few years while I continued to work on myself and process the childhood abandonment that I went through - the fact I only saw emotion and got a hug after I got my ass beat with that 2x4 was a buried trauma for me to deal with & never being included was another one as well -  after a series of long and hard dialogues with my parents to walk them through the trauma I went through from them, they showed remorse and were visibly distraught at what had occurred by them - I slowly met them a couple times a year for coffee - and eventually an end of life scenario allowed me to open the door for more than a coffee & we slowly rebuilt to a surface level relationship…

And honestly, I lost a whole lot of drama without having siblings and my life couldn’t be more care free without their baggage that they brought.

I learned a lot about codependency, being a child of emotionally immature parents, having siblings and parents that are enmeshed in one another - and while I can’t say you all should run, I am saying you should find a really good therapist to process life with - and if the shoe fits, cut them off and move on. 

I carried my siblings with me for years - I didn’t deserve their shit & they didn’t deserve my time. 

All that to say - break the cycle of familiar trauma -  my parents had their own trauma and so did their parents etc and none of them managed it appropriately, they just hid it and then passed it down to their kids (not that they knew that). Cut the bad apples out of your life - trim the trees, let healthy relationships grow and let ones that no longer make sense, fade away. Make your own way if you need to - don’t let anyone tell you,”they’re family “ - well, families don’t do that stuff to each other and if someone that shares your genes is doing it, they might be your biological family but they didn’t make it into your logical family, the people you chose and who choose you back. 

Do yourself a favor, get help, cut the generational trauma especially if you have or want to have kids - even without that factor, it’s still helpful to see how past traumas impact present and future decisions and behaviors.

The end.

I understand everyone is different, but curious if anyone in the forum ever dealt with any thing similar?

My recent psych mentioned they think I may be dealing some with dysautonomia as well. Unfortunately, where i live no one really specializes or cares about nervous system disorders.

Well I am looking into starting up 150 SR Wellbutrin. Here doesn't offer the XR, and haven't done well with IR formulations, so don't want to try that.   
Any thoughts on what to expect and/or how you have reacted (if anyone similar?)

  
I will admit a little nervous as recent times trying caffeine/coffee it caused more spasms/GI issues. I used to consume some, back in the day when I took Effexor. I came off this for various reasons and do not want to go the SSRI route, as these contributed to sexual side effects and do not feel these are helpful.

Current thoughts is to try Wellbutrin. If anxiety, is too much maybe pair up with Pristiq or go directly to Pristiq. Hopeful Wellbutrin can help fix main issues though.

I have been in physical security (ELV, CCTV, Door access) as a technician for almost 3 years, transition into a presales role for network and network + endpoint security for 2 years, now 1 year plus in solution consultant for a System Integrator company.

High level of what resources I used - all free resources except the ones in the bootcamp.

1. 5 days bootcamp that comes with the voucher, its company paid so might as well. Can't really remember much of it probably due to the info overload, but the materials and practice questions they provide is really useful to gauge which area you're weak in.
2. Pete Zerger exam cram playlist

Oh god i owe it all to this man, I can't read even 3 pages of the study guide without falling asleep. Play like 3 times of the 8 hours version and some of the deep dive videos in the areas I'm not familiar with.

3. Destination Certifications Mindmap video

Watched it the first time before any serious studying, and couldn't grasp half of what Rob Witcher is talking about. Played it again 2 days before the exam and everything makes sense.

4.  50 CISSP Practice Questions in Technical Institute of America

Watched it 2 times and really understand what that ""think like a manager"" is all about. Love Andrew Ramdayal and how he explains stuffs. Also good idea of what kind of questions the the exam will throw at you.

5. How To Think Like a Manager for the CISSP Exam - Director's Cut by Luke Ahmed

Found this yesterday before the exam, thank God I did. Got a good understanding of how to think when answering the questions.

There are a few more videos i don't remember, like Prabh Nair and Kelly Handerhan.

I think the area that plays the largest role is my experiences with my jobs, I can skip a lot of the study materials like DLP, Antivirus, OSI, especially physical security and access control (I know why people really struggle with this portion if they have never dealt with physical security before).

Total study time - 8 hours a day for a week before exam, excluding read up 2 months prior after the bootcamp every time I have some free time. Probably less than 10 hours total.

Exam day

It was bad, I can't sleep (due to stress maybe?), slept at 4am woke up at 8.30am. Massive headache. 2 shots of coffee. Feels like burning out even before the exam starts at 1pm. But once the exam starts I felt focused, I'm sure of my answers maybe half the time? I didn't even realize at which question I'm at most of the time and to be honest, don't worry about it. Walked out after the survey and still unsure if I've passed or failed before looking at the paper. So best advice I can give is don't think too much into it. just answer based on applying what you've learned and your judgement (as an advisor).

So I have some questions for seasoned ISC2 people here.

1. Is it important to choose my endorser? I have a few people that I know that can be one. (1 is my bootcamp trainer and another is my ex-colleague)
2. My CC AMF is expiring in 2 days, can't wait for the CISSP evaluation, should I pay now? Or wait for the member AMF and pay it at once? Will this lapse my CC?",7,1740663383.0,cissp,4,1.0,False

Some time ago I tuned my CPU (AiO) to not ramp up as quickly since AiO has quite a lot of thermal mass and CPU temperature (which controls fan speed) can spike far ahead of liquid temperature (which I wish controlled fan speed). Some time later the PC would randomly shut down or freeze... but there was no relevant warning/error in system logs. Like, if the GPU driver crashed or CPU overheated it would leave some note in the logs. But there was none.  
  
I stress tested it a bit, causing couple more crashes, and noted that GPU and CPU temperatures were acceptable. Well, GPU junction was just under 100℃ (which still should be fine for junction and edge was well below that), but after opening some panels it would stabilize around 93℃ junction and PC would crash anyway.

  
Then some post on the Internet noted that sudden poweroff like that may likely be PSU issue. And sure enough, PSU case was quite hot even though it didn't exhaust much heat. Moving GPU away from PSU stopped crashes. Turns out SF750 can't quite keep up with heat from 6950XT...  
  
I guess I'll have to ramp up the CPU fan speed a bit. It's a bit annoying that I can't account for GPU temperature though... Perhaps the best (simple and effective) solution would be to connect an air temperature sensor right after the radiator and control the speed with that? So it wouldn't ramp up immediately with CPU activity, only after the radiator gets a bit warmer, and would also ramp up if air got hot because of the GPU.  


I wonder why PSU just turned off though, shouldn't the PSU fan handle that heat? Maybe it was just recirculating hot air because exhaust (controlled by CPU temperature) wasn't sufficient. Or maybe the issue was that heat was coming from outside the PSU case and sensor placement wasn't tuned for that. I also wonder what temperature specifically caused PSU to trip. I mean, air temperature was around 60-70℃ (per motherboard sensors) and SF750 supposedly doesn't generate much heat itself... Perhaps GPU backplate came in contact with PSU case and transferred more heat that way? Way too many questions for one coffee...

My name is Eli, I’m a kayak guide in the San Juan islands and I’m looking for a Canadian companion to do the grand tour paddle this summer. I’ve been sitting on the idea of this paddle for a while after circumnavigating all of San Juan Island itself a few times and eying all the routes the islands have to offer, only I want this paddle to have higher calling.

This moment in space and time feels like a fragile one, the social norms and cross cultural ties that were once revered and celebrated between our neighboring countries have become fractured (by he who shall not be named). I want this paddle to be a solidarity paddle, one full of good laughs, discourse, and cowboy coffee before dawn. At a time I feel we should be leaning on each other more than ever my country’s leadership has decided to walk the road alone with elbows out and an evil chip on its shoulder. In addition I’d love for each of us to pick a charity we’re passionate about and fundraise over the course of the summer for it. 

Only requirements are as follows;
-Hail from the great north (if you’re a Canadian that’s moved to the states in recent years I welcome you too)
-Paddle experience 
-Positive Attitude (no boat needed I can supply all gear)

1izfv2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1izfv2u/i_stole_an_old_lady_with_a_crutchs_table_at_a_café/,"I ""stole"" an old lady with a crutch's table at a café","So, I need to give a lot of context for you to properly judge the whole situation. This morning I woke up too late to have enough time for breakfast, so I got ready and got to class. I was given 15' as a break, I was pretty hungry by that point and had started to be a little hangry as well. I decided to try and run to a convenience store to get a small sandwich. I got there and they were out of my favourite one. That made me upset and I left. Thinking what else I could eat that would be quick, I remembered that my favourite café was just around the corner, and thought maybe I could get something there quickly. When I got there, the server asked me what I wanted right away, and I didn't know because I needed to think about it, so I told her I didn't known yet. She turned around and got busy with something else. After a few seconds I made a decision and waited for her to turn around and serve me. She didn't. For a good minute, she didn't. I didn't know how to call her attention without sounding rude. I have ADHD and knowing how to properly interact with people is difficult for me. So I waited, hoping, expecting *her* to turn around asap when she was done with whatever she was doing. She never did. I got even more pissed than I already was because I'm in a rush, hungry and this lady is not paying any attention to me + I'm frustrated because I don't know how to call her attention without being rude. While I waited for her, since I had already made a decision, I looked around the café to decide which table I wanted. The best one was by a big window and the sunshine was coming in + the feng shui was amazing because it was out of the way and away from both the counter and the bathroom. So I decided on it. But, at least where I live (Spain), it is custom and polite to wait until you are served to actually pick a table, as a sign of respect for the people in front of you who came first. This is a very important detail. I did not leave any of my belongings there because I was the only one in line and custom dictates it is my right to choose my table, once I'm served, before anyone else that comes after me in line. Coming back to the server, she only turned around when she heard the door open and a new customer came in. Completely ignoring me, standing there in front of her, arms crossed, waiting for her to pay me attention, she asked the new customer what she wanted. I got even more pissed. I told her that I already knew, ""for a while already, actually"". She nonchalantly turned to me and took my order. FINALLY. I paid and went to sit at the table I had chosen while waiting. To my surprise, one singular crutch had spawned leaning on that very table. ""Oh my God. You've got to be kidding me..."" I looked around, both surprised and pissed, to see if maybe there actually was someone at that table before me and maybe they had got up for a moment or something and I hadn't seen the crutch before for some reason. Nope, there was no one actually. The only person standing was an old lady, who was the customer that came in right after me. I looked her in the eye, waiting for her to maybe say something in case the crutch was hers, but after 10 long seconds, she said nothing. I was so done with everything at that point, and just wanted to quickly have my coffee and my muffin to rush back to class before my break was over. So, I sat there, since, again, it was my right. As soon as my butt touched the chair, the old lady I had waited for a good while to make a comment about the crutch because it appeared to be hers but did not say a word, rushed to my table and angrily told me she had ""reserved"" it with her crutch. I told her, as calmly as I could considering how pissed I was by that point, that I had looked around and didn't see anyone was already sitting there and since I came and placed my order first, it was my right to pick that table. She kept complaining and told me that there were other tables available. I asked her why she had had the audacity to even ""reserve"" that table before she was served in the first place, knowing I was first and it was MY right to get that table. ""Man, I just wanted my 5 minutes of peace by the sunshine to eat something and leave for class....why is this happening to me??"" is what I thought. 

Now, even if it was my right to have that table and she was very rude to ""reserve"" it before she placed her order, probably abusing the fact that she's ""an old lady with a crutch"", in other circumstances, I would have probably been the bigger person and would have left her the table. In  fact, I normally do things like that. By other circumstances I mean a moment when I'm not hangry and rushing to eat something during my 15' break from class. But the situation being like it was today, nope. Another thing you must consider is I'm a child abuse survivor, and have been for years trying to recover from my people pleasing tendencies. I have for a while tried very hard to stand up for myself in situations like these when people just want to be rude to me and it is very hard for me to really know when is the right moment to stand up for myself and when I should rather be the bigger person and I feel like I'm constantly learning and improving, but I'm not there yet.

# 1. The Life of the Mind

**Solsolico:** I’m going to go on a pretty long-winded rant here, so bear with me. TLDR; it’s me questioning the validity of the so called “life of the mind” and what I will also refer to as “intellectual tourism”.

For the longest time, I agreed that so-called active research is a worthwhile endeavor. It’s worthwhile to spend time reading books by proper investigative journalists, for example.

But yesterday and today, while I’m going through some real shit in my life, I saw two people debating a moral and political issue about burkas in the USA. Someone remarked that wearing burkas in Minnesota is disrespectful. It was a discussion on Reddit.

Usually, I would read this type of discussion and be engaged with it mentally, thinking it’s interesting to see different perspectives. But I couldn’t force myself to read it today. It struck me how damn pointless the discussion was for me. It was just play, and there’s nothing wrong with playing, but that’s all it is. None of these people in the discussion are going to impact the situation. They are probably very far removed from it. And me, the spectator? I’m super isolated from that situation. I don’t see people wearing burkas where I live, and even if I did, I’m not part of any community that wears them. I don’t have friends or family who wear burkas.

Sure, it’s fun to play with ethics and intellectual ideas. But that’s all it is... it’s play. When I read a book about the history of gangs in El Salvador, I’m just playing. In the same way, if I listen to a podcast about Aristotle that Eisel recorded, I’m just playing. It’s just play.

So what? Some people like skiing, going to the beach, meeting locals from different cultures, or mountaineering. But is intellectual tourism any more meaningful than ecotourism or physical exercise tourism? Is reading about the history of some place far removed from me really meaningful? Are we just fooling ourselves into thinking that being intellectual tourists is a life worth living and time well spent? Because when I read that discussion, as an intellectual tourist, I thought, “This is so unimportant to me and my life”.

Don’t get it twisted—I’ve read books and learned important things from them. The reason I mention the El Salvador book is that I learned a lot from it.

Okay, but great. I’m not trying to be a politician. So what is this information for? To seem smarter in front of others? To understand one part of the world better? For what? You know, I’ve been doing plyometric training on and off for a few years, but why? I don’t play competitive sports anymore. Plyometrics isn’t good for long-term health or joints. Why am I doing it? Because I have some idea about being a great athlete as I enter my 30s (yes, that’s the reason... I’ve been a good athlete my whole life and have a fear of losing it)? Resistance training, cardio, flexibility, balance—these are great for long-term health. Plyometrics? Not so much. I quit break dancing for long-term health reasons a year or two back.

So, now I feel like reading books for the sake of reading or living the so-called life of the mind is like doing plyometrics in my 30s when I don’t play any sports. Listen, if I were in a book club, then reading any book would be meaningful, because of the social moments shared later-on. Reading a non-fiction book a month on my own? Also worthwhile. Reading 3 a week? Lunacy.

If you enjoy reading intellectual books, great. But to posture it as something better than being social and physically active? I used to believe it, but now I think, “No, that’s not true.” I’d rather go hiking with a friend than read any book in the world. One is inherently meaningful to me, and the other isn’t.

He likes to call people “on permanent vacation”. Hence, I use the term intellectual tourism. What has he done with his intellect? He’s not a politician or changing policy. He’s not working for any organization with a political agenda. He’s not a journalist or a historian. What’s the point of living the so-called life of the mind? Is there intrinsic value to information? I don’t think so, not anymore. The idea that the average person should be living this way, I now see that as absurd.

If he’s happy reading books instead of socializing or playing in other ways, all the power to him. But for years, he’s thought this made him a better person, something I agreed with. Now, I see through it and think, “Nope, that’s nonsense.” He can frame it how he wants, like he’s some badass we should all aspire to be like. But if he enjoys it, great. Yet, he frames it as some type of moral duty almost. And if he doesn’t enjoy it, why is he doing it? It’s not work. I get that a plumber might not enjoy changing a faucet cartridge, but it pays the bills and keeps society’s infrastructure running. It’s necessary. Reading books just to read books? It’s play. Sure, some reading is important for cognitive health (and it’s useful to be informed politically, but you don’t need to incessantly reading 5 books simultaneously for that). Mental math, learning new words, and learning new physical skills are also important for cognitive health. But cognitive health isn’t the lifestyle he’s talking about or idealizing. He is like an “intellectual bodybuilder”. Muscle mass and fitness are important, but you don’t need to be a bodybuilder to achieve what’s important.

-------

**Eisel:** One reply to two quotations in succession: (1) *“If you enjoy reading intellectual books, great. But to posture it as something better than being social and physically active? I used to believe it, but now I think, “No, that’s not true.”* (2) *“He can frame it how he wants, like he’s some badass we should all aspire to be like. But if he enjoys it, great. Yet, he frames it as some type of moral duty almost. And if he doesn’t enjoy it, why is he doing it? \[…\] He is like an “intellectual bodybuilder”. Muscle mass and fitness are important, but you don’t need to be a bodybuilder to achieve what’s important.”*

I don’t regard myself as having been “an intellectual bodybuilder” at any stage of my life: I am neither flattered nor insulted by this statement, I think you’re in the position of being intellectually exhausted —and you presume that what I’m doing is far more intellectually exhausting still, when you peer across the chasm between us.

If you’re doing humanitarian work in Laos, do you want to throw yourself into learning the Lao language? Not everyone does: there were people doing those jobs who had zero engagement with the language, history or politics. They earned their paycheck, got a pat on the back for trying to make the world a better place, and they got on an airplane when they’d had enough of the experience.

Without false humility, I’d say that the level of effort I made in learning Laotian should be regarded as the bare minimum requirement for someone who chooses to put themselves in that situation. When I slept under a mosquito net, I read the collected works of John Dryden with a flashlight (i.e., there was no electricity). I was also studying Pali and several different periods of history. That’s what I did for fun, in my spare time, when other people were drinking alcohol and… worse.

I did have friends in Vientiane, but we spoke amongst ourselves in English —sometimes French, sometimes German. John Dryden, also, I read in English —not Lao. And when I was in the room, we would talk about history and politics. Most of those friends I met spontaneously, at coffee shops.

I owned a bicycle. I did long distance cycling (circa 115 km per run). I had other hobbies and interests. I had a gym membership for most of the time that I was in Vientiane, too.

Yes, there were people there who looked at how I was spending my time and wondered, intellectually, how I could possibly do any more; but from my perspective, I would ask how I could possibly do less.

So, I return to the quotation: “*But to posture it as something better than being social and physically active?*”

You reach a point of diminishing returns with “being socially and physically active” fairly quickly: how many hours per week do you want to be scheduled for exercise? How many hours per week do you want to spend socializing? The number is not zero in either case; however, if you really challenge yourself to put a specific number to it… it is going to be finite.

The repetition of these activities (social and physical) benefits you very little, and with more hours, past a point of diminishing returns, it benefits you less and less.

What I learned in researching and writing ***No More Manifestos*** really does accumulate: there’s a sort of “intellectual benefit” (from that active research leading to an informed opinion) that will endure for the rest of my life —whereas spending twice as much time doing pushups (during those same months in which I wrote the book) would not have benefitted me in any way at all —or, at least, not in a way that would accumulate and still endure years later / right now.

Re: *”\[He talks about himself as if\] he’s some badass we should all aspire to be like.”*

I do not think “you all” should aspire to be like me, but I have known many (MANY) people who directly asked me for advice as to how they could be more like me. Really. Even long before I had a youtube channel. Young and old. Some people want to be more intellectual than they already are. Some people want to be sober. Some people want to be vegan. Some people want to be able to record a three hour livestream on Aristotle (or a bunch of other random topics from the history of political science) with zero notes, zero preparation, etc., in the way that I could (and I did).

You may think they’re eccentric, and you may think I’m eccentric, but, in my experience, including many face-to-face conversations, there are always ***some*** people around who want advice as to how they can live the life of the mind as I define it. This can include very specific questions about reading and research —about how Melissa and I would read books together, for example. It can include specific questions about political protests, creative projects, etc.; so if you think I’m eccentric, you will have to imagine how eccentric these other people are who are asking for advice as to how they can imitate me in eccentricity.

So, the comparison to bodybuilding here is apt in one limited sense: not everyone wants to be a bodybuilder. However, those who do want to may well seek out advice from someone else they see bodybuilding, etc.

However, I don’t see it that way: instead, a great deal of conflict arises from my perception of the issue in terms of “bare minimum requirements” and moral obligations. It would create less tension with colleagues around me if I had this kind of (“narcissistic”) delusion that I was some extraordinary specimen pushing at the limits of what’s humanly possible —if I considered myself to be an intellectual bodybuilder who could show off for the crowd. If I regarded myself as extraordinary, it would make others feel more comfortable about being ordinary.

Instead, I regard my contemporaries as falling short bare of minimum requirements —and at some point that becomes a moral problem, not just an intellectual one. When you’re looking at a university professor who has not done the bare minimum reading required to teach a subject, that’s not just a matter of individual laziness: it entails a moral problem and a predictable conflict with someone like myself.

I learned a lot in a short time, in those years in Laos. And I was surrounded by people who’d been there for many more years than I who never did any of the “bare minimum requirement” work that I did. But yes, I also had a very active life socially and physically: there were enough hours in the day for all that and more.

**Solsolico:** I didn’t expect this to get a reply from you, but I appreciate that you’ve come here to discuss. I don’t know how many of my comments you’ve read... I hope you don’t see me as a basic hater because I’ve actually watched your channel for many years. A lot of things you’ve said have had important, profound effects on how I see the world. I do think I mentioned that several times throughout the comments I’ve left. PM me if you want the most profound example (not something I want to share publicly).

I originally left the comment you have quoted in the context of when you posted this Instagram story which juxtaposes you spending your time reading books compared to other people spending their time at the beach or doing some other recreational activity. My comment was my reflections on hearing this type of perspective from you over almost a decade and just losing conviction of the perspective. I think it’s fair to say that over the years, you have on many occasions disparaged people doing things for recreation and in some way verbalized that reading books is superior; other people are living meaningless lives.

Due to your influence, I did hold this belief as well, for years. But as is often the case with new ideas, innovations, or thoughts, it’s about the right place and right time. I was going through something challenging in my life, and that post of yours came up. If I had seen that post a week before or a week after, it wouldn’t have been the right place and right time, and I probably wouldn’t have had this reflection about your influence on me.

With that being said, of course, I agree that if you’re in Laos and you’re working there, you should learn the language. I was always on board with your critiques against Durian Rider and the Fruit Fest. You know how it would probably be better if they learned some of the local language and learned about some of the history of the country and some of the political, social, and economic issues that the country faces, seeing that he had hosted this festival every single year.

But that isn’t what I’m referring to. Knowledge to do your work or craft better obviously has instrumental value. This doesn’t have anything to do with doing the bare minimum in your job. This is about the pastime of reading books.

Sure, you say that the law of diminishing returns comes quickly with social and physical stuff. I mean, I feel like that’s the case with reading books as well. I questioned whether this is something the average person should be doing for the sake of doing, if there’s an intrinsic value to it. Like, sure, if you’re a politician or an academic, then you should be reading a lot of books. It’s your job to learn from the past.

But when you’re just an average person who maybe works as a language teacher, landscaper, investment advisor, or bike mechanic, I also think that there is a point of diminishing returns when it comes to reading books, and it comes pretty quick. But you said it yourself: when you were living in Laos, you preferred to read about history rather than socialize with alcohol. But couldn’t that just be as deep as it gets? It was more enjoyable to you than the other options.

I also do not agree that the point of diminishing returns in a social life is reached quickly, but this is probably just due to personal differences. I’m probably a much more social person than you are.

If you sincerely find meaning and joy in reading 100’s of books per year, fantastic. But when I look at myself and think of the books I’ve read and the time I’ve spent reading books and academic papers and stuff like that, I really do think that, yeah, that time wasn’t well spent. Like the amount of papers I’ve read about phonology... way too many for someone who is not an academic and does not want to be an academic. Sure, at some point, I enjoyed reading them. Sometimes I was fascinated. But eventually, it got to a point where it was just a chore. But I had this mindset or worldview that, no, this is important to do. So I stuck with it. And for what? I feel like I would’ve gained more “value” if I stuck through an electrician course; if I stuck through a pottery class; if I stuck through an auto-mechanics course.

The bare-bones version of this criticism I laid towards this worldview you espouse is that reading books has no intrinsic value. If you enjoy it (which you said you do), then great. It’s not a harmful hobby like video games. But basketball isn’t a harmful hobby either; neither is surfing, neither is hiking. There is a bare minimum of books one should read in a year, sure. But “bookmaxxing” is not going to be a life well-lived if the person sees it as a chore. And the way you talk about reading books and compare it to other pastimes, whether you say it overtly or not, there is the implicit premise we all pick up on, which is “my hobby is worthwhile, yours is a waste of life”.

The only reason I care so much is because it’s a worldview I did hold for many years. The average person who disagrees with the worldview would just move right past it.

---------

**Avg Web Intellectual:** One needs to read and educate themselves on the topics they’re interested in, not random shit to posture like Eisel. I had made a post here about how an NPD can’t be an intellectual. And I would say your argument applies to NPDs. Because they’re not genuine. Their purpose is to posture and pretend. That’s why they know it all and talk about everything.

Now regarding the burka stuff, on its own it might seem small and insignificant. Maybe because you’re regarding the topic as something isolated. You need frameworks to apply when approaching these topics so they stand on something. So each topic you learn then becomes a node in your web of knowledge.

For example, for me, for a very long time I’ve never read anything historical or political. Then as I started learning about modern colonialism / imperialism, racism, etc. I have developed interest in modern history and politics. Because whatever I read I can apply to this framework. It is not intellectual tourism, because this is effecting who I am voting, who I am donating to, who I am friending, which political activism I’m engaging in, etc. This is actually future changing stuff. It might be insignificant in individual level for most people, but it would have collective impact.

---------

**Solsolico:** I will try to expand and rephrase my new perspective here, since I don’t think we disagree on much. I can’t say I disagree with your comment.

I had this realization that most (basically all) of the discussions I engage with online are just a game to me. It’s just play. Of course, a discussion like this is a little more meaningful because it’s about how we live our lives. We’re kind of troubleshooting how we should spend our time and live our lives.

Obviously, the burqa example is a little more political than another example I could give, but it’s just that the burqa conversation was what I actually read. For example, if I go through my Reddit history, most of the things I talk about are what I’d be calling play. And that’s cool. But I just have to recognize it for what it is. It’s not some type of profound intellectual betterment. If it’s just play, then if I don’t want to play that, or I want to play something else more, then I should just play what I want to play more. Me discussing burqas is not profound. I’m not saying that it’s not a profound topic. What I’m saying is that me discussing it is not profound.

But there’s nothing wrong with play either. It’s just not any better than any other form of play.

The word “meaningless” is obviously a strong word, so if I ever used the word “meaningless” in prior comments, I will rescind that. Probably change it to “unprofound.”

Something utterly indisputably as just play would be a debate around something subjective, like whether smoothies are better with bananas or no bananas.

For example, I think there are some things that we need to learn about as a moral duty. If you live in the Americas, it’s a moral duty to read about the history of the country with regards to colonization and racism and all of that.

If in Minnesota there were a referendum for, say, a burqa ban, I think then it would be a moral duty for Minnesotans to read about the politics and history of burqas. I’m not sure what else the readings would entail because I’m not an expert on this topic.

Hearing your perspective, however, is interesting because I can contrast it with mine. I’ve properly read about colonialism for more than 15 years now, at least in the Americas. And, of course, I have an opinion on whether wearing a burqa is disrespectful to Americans or not, but for me to leave a comment and engage in a debate with other users about this topic, the only reason I would ever do that is because I would find it to be fun... a fun debate because for whatever reason, I enjoy intellectual conflict and disagreements and for whatever reason I like writing long comments.

And I’m not saying I was conscious of this “fun” factor before, but properly analysing myself, it’s always been about that. Like when I discussed about the morality of billboards, or the morality of alcohol ads. A few years ago, yeah I viewed those discussions like I was spending my time in a productive way. But now I re-analyse it, and just realize like... those discussions were fun and ultimately we were just playing.

And it’s not that fun can’t be healthy. Playing basketball is healthy. Having an intellectual discussion is, of course, going to be cognitively healthy. But at the end of the day, I’m not writing policies or academic papers. So is it any more meaningful than playing a sport, for fun (which also ends up being healthy?)

I guess that’s kind of where I’m at. Hope I explained that well. Basically: learning as a chore vs. learning as hobby... and then, say sports as a hobby, music as a hobby, art as a hobby vs. learning as a hobby.

He puts on a facade. It must be so exhausting by the end of the day. I can’t imagine the drain on anyone that has to interact with him.

And his life of the mind is a construct. It’s only real to him. Most of us have been witness to the construct and see straight away it’s a house of glass. Bananas on a window sill for company. Just generally being a miserable human to everyone.

We should be celebrating just how different we all are, not disparaging each other because we don’t read Greek history or learn languages or play video games.

**Solsolico:**

>

I’m now wondering how much of this so-called life of the mind is just a sunk cost fallacy.

For the past year, I had been working on this project. At some point, I realized that the output of the project was not worth the input. The project would have taken me over 10,000 working hours to complete, and I knew this. But I had already put in several hundred hours and figured out most of the experimenting, innovating, and troubleshooting. So, I kept working on it, even knowing that it was ultimately a waste of my time. I put in several hundred more hours after realizing it was a waste before finally stopping.

It’s a hard pill to swallow—to admit to yourself that you wasted 1,000 hours of your life. It was so hard to admit that it almost propelled me to waste an additional 9,000 hours.

If he ever felt that his life of the mind and reading books was a waste of time, well, he’s probably already invested thousands of hours. A huge amount of his time spent would be rendered meaningless if he concluded that this life of the mind was meaningless.

He never really made a logical argument with premises to back up the claim that the life of the mind is worth living. He talked about it in a way that it was implicitly true. He never made the case for why reading ancient Greek philosophy was more meaningful than attending the fruit fest in Thailand that Durian Rider hosted. I get his critiques about having a festival in a country with economic and social problems and the moral duty to be informed about those issues. But that’s completely different from the so-called life of the mind—being an intellectual tourist.

But I’m just making a hypothesis here. I don’t know what goes on in his head. All I know is that I don’t see the life of the mind or being an intellectual tourist as intrinsically meaningful anymore. I don’t think it’s necessarily even respectable, in the same way, I don’t think bodybuilding is respectable. I’m not going to disrespect someone for bodybuilding, but it’s not something I find deserving of respect. Being an intellectual tourist is not the same as being a doctor without borders or a firefighter. To me, it’s on the same level as being a bodybuilder. It’s something personal for someone, but there’s nothing more to it than that. It’s a hobby, and many people might see it as a waste of time. But the same can be said about any hobby. On the other hand, I don’t think anyone would say doing three hours of exercise a week is a waste of time. We all know that is fundamental for our long-term health. Living the life of the mind is a hobby; it is not a virtue and it’s not foundational. That’s how I see it now, anyway.

**Eisel:** I suppose it would be a devastating refutation for me to point out ***THAT I AM HAPPY.*** ;-)

This is an interesting aspect of internet culture in the 21^(st) century: the idea that one side “wins” and the other side “loses” simply by insisting, “I know you’re not happy!”

The point here being, “You teach us that we should all force our girlfriends to read Aristotle and Plato’s *First Alcibiades* with us, but just look at yourself: ***you’re not happy!****”* Genuinely, you have no idea how happy it might make the two of you —conversely, you have no idea how miserable. The two of you might well break up by the time you get to the end of the *Gorgias*.

Happiness is not what people think it is: if I meet a true believing Communist who is happy this will not motivate me to re-evaluate the morality of Communism —nor will it make me re-evaluate the psychological significance of belief itself. It does not matter how intensely happy the Communist may be, nor how miserable I may be by contrast. The happiest drunkard cannot convince me that I’m miserable because I’m sober —nor can he convince me that he’d be any less happy if he were sober himself. However, as I’ve already disclaimed: I am extremely happy with my life, at this very moment. (Feb. of 2025)

Happiness comes about in unexpected ways: I criticize the notion that you can know what will make you happy with any greater certainty than you’d ever know what will make you miserable. The reasons for one’s own happiness are always discovered too late.

A large part of my public work has been self-criticism, reflecting on bad decisions I’ve made in my life, and examining the false assumptions “behind” (or “beneath”) those decisions. You will notice that the participants in this Reddit group resolutely ignore this evidence that I’m not a narcissist (although it’s a huge part of my corpus, even appearing within my books and articles, not just in my podcasts and videos). If I were diagnosed with NPD I wouldn’t be ashamed of it any more than a diagnosis with autism: each resembles the other closely enough that (e.g.) the symptoms of autism seen in Elon Musk could instead be interpreted as narcissism. If you’ve known people with NPD you wouldn’t ridicule them for this: they are quite incapable of doing what I’ve done (certainly more than a hundred times on the internet) publicly or privately. They are also incapable of doing what Durianrider did, on numerous occasions, in having a laugh at his own expense (i.e., I have never believed that Durianrider had NPD). They are quite incapable of making comedy mocking themselves, and/or engaging in the kind of serious self-criticism I’ve been so bold as to bore my audience with.

Studying Chinese at UVic made me miserable: I can explain to you the reasonable expectations that led up to the decision to study that subject at that place —and I can explain to you the false assumptions that the experience debunked. That’s how life is for all of us: the things that make us happy arise adventitiously —they are very hard to foresee.

This is one of many reasons why I urge people ***NOT*** to live their lives ***FOR*** happiness: they are making the mistake of regarding something unknowable as known.

# 2. ‘What we have here, is a failure to communicate’

**Simbabones:** I’ve been reading through the criticisms of you on Reddit, and they force me to take a critical stance on your approach to communication. Much of the banter is discussing whether or not you have NPD (or more convincingly, “High-Conflict Personality Disorder,” which is not an actually medically recognized disorder but might be a meaningful concept), which is much less relevant than the actual discussion of your concrete “symptoms.”

The bare fact of the matter: it is rather suspicious that you could not develop a single lasting political alliance throughout your entire career, even granting that A. most people are shallow and self-indulgent, and B. the leaders of veganism have been particularly shallow and self-indulgent. Of course, suspicion is merely a piece of empirical evidence, not a conclusion in itself.

It would be uncontroversial to deem you “confrontational,” but confrontationality is in a significant way the result of the combination of conscientiousness and integrity. Confrontation is fundamental to bringing about change, whether that be large-scale or individual. In the vegan movement, you had no choice but to be confrontational; the other vegan activists were promoting explicitly counterproductive variants of veganism (or pseudo-veganism) that could not (and did not) scale.

NEVERTHELESS: Several commenters have pointed out that you cannot “read the room.” Let’s look at a case study. I just recently watched your podcast Unnatural Vegan: Why Everyone Hates Eisel Mazard. You stated that Unnatural Vegan’s arguments “weren’t worthy of response,” and this initial comment led in a significant way to your popular downfall. You assumed that both Unnatural Vegan and her audience would understand where you are coming from when saying that her arguments “weren’t worthy of response,” and that they would accept such a point of view with a detached demeanor, essentially admitting to your intellectual superiority. It was obvious to me (with or without hindsight) that such a response would never happen, and that the only reasonably expected response would be one of offense and even condemnation. You couldn’t “read the room.”

“Normal” people expect a direct refutation when they make a series of arguments. When they ignore your previous videos on the subject and suggest you never made any attempt to justify your positions, someone who can “read the room” would immediately come to the conclusion that this person expects a direct refutation of their own arguments. To believe that that would be a waste of time since you already gave such reasons in previous videos would be false: a direct refutation is, indeed, the only way to respond, not because it is an efficient ideal, but because that is what the majority of people expect by default. You hadn’t been able to read the room, and it villainized you in the eyes of who knows how many vegans (or otherwise).

How many other similar circumstances had you found yourself in, either in person or online, because you had assumed that everyone else was on the same wavelength as you (the ultimate meaning of “you can’t read the room!”)? How many possible political alliances were shattered because you couldn’t accommodate your communication style to fit that of “normal” people? One of your most crushing self-criticisms is that it took you so long to realize that almost no other people think like you do (a.k.a. in a detached, unemotional way).

Whether you are “narcissistic” or similar is not nearly as interesting as the fact that you have apparently been unable to adjust your communicative approach when such was crucial for your political networking. This, combined with your confrontationality and high confidence, could easily come off as “narcissistic,” your capacity to engage in self-criticism notwithstanding. And when people gain the sense that you have NPD, any alliance is impossible, and all trust is lost.

The fact that your circle on the Internet BELIEVE you have NPD is indicative of a personal failure, in any case, due to your inability to “read the room” (or perhaps, your unwillingness to change your communicative approach for the sake of some ideal?). Their points of view don’t come from nowhere. I can trace them to their roots.

I MAY BE WRONG.

I will be documenting my own experience, either as I go along or as some kind of after-the-fact autobiography, of meeting normal people and trying to get them to enter the world of politics: and not just politics, but MY politics, which has a lot of overlap with yours. We have a lot in common in terms of interest, personality, and philosophy, but I am much less prickly (the word I like to use). In a sense, my temperament functions as a scientific experiment: key variables are constant EXCEPT for communication style. I am somewhat convinced that your communication style is a core reason for your repeated failures in life. I may be wrong. The Redditors take me to be right, and your track record adds a little empirical support. My life will be the litmus test! And from this, decades down the line, I may be able to answer what, if anything, is left of the 21^(st) century intellectual.

**Eisel:** Re: “…it is rather suspicious that you could not develop a single lasting political alliance throughout your entire career…”

Tell me: who is Unnatural Vegan in an alliance with?

Tell me: who is Erin Janus in an alliance with?

Tell me: who is Vegan Gains in an alliance with?

Now tell me, honestly: can you imagine that I would want to drink a cup of coffee sitting at the same table as any one of these three people? We could extend the list to many more, from Isaac (“Ask Yourself”) Brown to Paul Bashir.

You are beginning with an utterly false “optic” (or “framing”) of the problem as if I had attempted and failed to sustain a political alliance with any (or all) of these people —and you’re then taking the further step of attributing this failure to my “communication style” that can supposedly be reasonably interpreted as “NPD”.

NPD is a very recognizable pattern of behavior, and a purely behavioral diagnosis: I have none of the checkmarks on the checklist for it —and for largely the same reasons that I have none of the checkmarks for autism.

This whole approach, Simba, evades the extent to which my differences with these people are real rather than merely a matter of communication style misinterpreted as a diagnosis of a psychological disorder.

Unnatural Vegan would absolutely never accept what I said about dogs and cats (pet ownership). She would absolutely never accept what I said about Peter Singer. This is not an exhaustive list of the things she would never accept about me: these are real differences entailing real enmity —they entail hatred from her directed against me, even if I do not reciprocate this hatred.

Now tell me, who has had a worse communication style, and who could not be diagnosed with a serious psychological order, in this same list of personalities? • Paul Bashir. • Isaac (“Ask Yourself”) Brown. • Vegan Gains. • Erin Janus. • Unnatural Vegan.

To say that these are people with “a problem of communication style” would be a drastic understatement. To say that each and every one of them could be diagnosed with NPD would, also, be an understatement.

It is absolutely absurd to say that Paul Bashir has none of the symptoms of NPD, and it would be absurd to say that these cannot be demonstrated from his communication style. You can now replace Paul’s name with every other name on that list, and speculate at what other diagnoses (with what other disabilities) might be more or less apt than NPD.

Quote, “Whether you are “narcissistic” or similar is not nearly as interesting as the fact that you have apparently been unable to adjust your communicative approach when such was crucial for your political networking.”

This model, Simba, presumes (1) that there are people for me to network with, and (2) that I have tried to adjust my communicative approach to network with them, but I have been unable to do so.

These two terrifyingly simple points are not true.

Erin Janus is not someone I can network with. It is extremely unlikely that anyone reading this would need even one word of further explanation as to why. Vegan Gains is not someone I can network with —and, likewise, no long explanation is needed. I could repeat this statement for each of the name on the bullet point list, above, and I could add many more names to it.

The incompatibility between myself and these other “content creators” is not the result of anyone’s inability to adjust their communicative approach, as you put it. The invidious rift between myself and each of them exists for relatively profound reasons (outlined efficiently enough in Future of an Illusion).

It is just not the case that I can adjust my communication style on the issue of pet ownership to then find myself friends and allies with people who want to kill cows to feed them to cats (and who believe the highest accomplishment a human being can dream of is adopting stray cats to help them get into kitty cat heaven).

To use an old catchphrase: stupidity is real.

Erin Janus is never going to be someone who could sit and have a conversation with me while drinking a cup of coffee. The inequality in intelligence is just too drastic for that.

The inequality isn’t as hard for me to endure as it is for them: try to imagine how humiliating and emotionally painful it is for (i) Vegan Gains, (ii) Unnatural Vegan, (iii) Brian Turner, (iv) Cami Petyn and (v) Modvegan to talk to me about their history with antidepressants —and my history of criticizing their public statement about antidepressants. It is much harder for them than it is for me.

The difference between Communists and Anti-Communists cannot be overcome by a change in communication style, nor the difference between Muslims and Atheists —and it does not help to “misinterpret” this difference in communication style as narcissism on one side or the other.

A diagnosis of NPD would really be possible for Erin Janus, Vegan Gains, etc., but it wouldn’t help any of them, and it certainly wouldn’t help them to overcome the obstacles that separate them from me.

None of these people ever could have been my colleagues: none of them ever could have contributed to Doomed Republic. There never was anyone who could be networked with.

But whenever I have a weak orgasm, the following symptoms, which persist for weeks:

* The ejaculate is very thin, liquidy, watery, and see through.  It shoots very far as a result.
* Penis is in a hard, rubbery state when flaccid. It's small and points straight out instead of downward. And it feels kind of cold while simultaneously feeling numb to touch.
* The inside of the urethra itches and stings slightly. Not full pain, just a slight stinging feeling.
* Scrotum is very tight and the testicles feel like they're elevated, almost like they're not even there.
* Penis feels very heavy, like a steel block inside.
* There's a hunger feeling, both in my mouth and my penis. Not for food, but it feels like a need to satisfy the itch. Like an addict craving a drug they don’t even know they’re addicted to.
* The urine stream doesn’t flow continuously—it frequently stops, and I have to push to get it going again.
* My entire body feels hot and agitated. I notice I have to turn the AC on higher.
* My skin also feels uncomfortable. Like, a shirt will feel rougher against my back and irritate the heck out of me.
* It feels like my body is filled with agitating buzzing bees. I can never find a comfortable position for my body as a result.
* My sensory perception is muted—from listening to music, to tasting food, but especially in touch—my fingertips don't perceive touch as strongly. Like I'm wearing an invisible nylon glove.
* I have a lower appetite. I struggle to finish and enjoy meals.
* I have increased anxiety. I notice I crave and consume more stimulant beverages like coffee and coke.
* Vocal cords feel very tense, just like other muscles in the body. This results in my needing more pressure to vibrate them and elicit sound. My voice is also higher pitched because of this tightness too.
* Shortness of breath. (Could this be because the vocal cords are tighter, restricting their relaxation to breathe?)
* Tiredness. Clear need to take a nap in the afternoon that isn't present during non POIS episodes.
* Notice a little constipation, where my bowel movements feel a bit incomplete. I also notice a deep stomach pain. It only occurs during HF/POIS episodes.
* Slight pain when touching penis. Like a burning, pinchy feeling.
* Also have a burning anus feeling after a bowel movement that isn't present in non POIS states.
* I have trouble consuming and learning information. I have trouble reading things in a fluid way. Feels like information doesn’t stick.",1,1740662869.0,hardflaccidresearch,0,1.0,False

I am M25
Its a long one...
First I also have my flaws and I do irritate her from time to time. Especially when I tell her the truth or what she aint doing right.

So I have been seeing this girl F23 for almost 3 years now we used to live separately but due to some unavoidable circumstances she had to move into my place we have been together for almost 2 yrs. At first things were fine. She cleared school I managed to secure her a job. She started being absolutely lazy (i had noticed it before but it was the manageable lazyness I ignored).  Every opportunity she has to avoid doing the cleaning I bet she will use it (omitting some details here). 

At the moment my house is very dirty including under the carpet, I use a sonny system the tall booth is very dirty especially the round base, curtains, dish rack.  Dust everywhere. if I dont do the cleaning she wont. I do help with the chores, I cook I clean I even wash the shoes because I am always keen to details when it comes to that. I had a cleaning lady (mama fua) but she said she is not doing her job well she will be doing it herself, saying its a waste of money to pay the lady. I do work from home but at the moment I went back to add studies, so I am in school during the day I get back to the house and start work untill 2am and I need to wake up at 5.30 am when I have 8 am classes, so that I beat the traffic, I have to connect from thika road to tow and then town to westlands. 

The last time she did the laundry was 3 weeks ago, today under scorching sun I had to wear a vest and a jacket because All my shirts and t shirts are dirty. Mind you all along I foot all the bills starting from rent to house shopping and even sending her some money for groceries she never lacked even when I was jobless in 2023 after form nilikua napiga ilizama, she always has something to eat and where to sleep. 

There is a day she asked for money for some groceries na nimetoka kulipa school fee ni 105k so I had made the first installment I told her I just paid school fee I am kinda broke uko salary vitu ndogo ndogo kama hizo you should be helping out (I am the one who got her the job I know she is being paid 25k basic salary and commission depending on how she performs I make more than her thou).

 I told her about it last night *(this is not the first time, she is always like ukiwa hapa I am lazy. Ati you need to step out uende pool ama drinks then niweke music nikue active.  Naenda wapi Sunday saa nne asubuhi na niko na hangs juu nililewa sato usiku) and instead of saying she will look for a way forward, she started saying I dont help her, I asked her lets even use the basics, when was the last time you cleaned the washroom, she cant recall because I always do. Asked her when was the last time you washed shoes, she cant recall. I asked her dont I cook and clean also? She said I am guilt tripping her. Man guilt tripping and I dont have a shirt to wear in the morning just because you cant wash even one. Started raising her voice at me I kept my calm and told her to shout all she wants but not to disrespect me. 

I told her if you cant do this tell me you wont and I asked her when you used to visit did you ever find my house dirty? Personally I like spreading my bed in the morning I cant sleep on a bed with things like clothes I have told her about it and she bad mouthed. I kept my cool and composure because I have temper and I dont like loosing it.

She took a shower and went to bed without cooking or cleaning the dishes in the sink. I was taking some coffee as I work and thats how I slept at around 3.30 am on an empty stomach. At moment its been more than 24hrs since I ate something just because someone doesn't want to was two non stick pots their lids and two plates. I am running on 2 mugs of coffe and an orange I ate today in the morning. I had just sent her money for food before she arrived at home then we quarreld. She told me she can refund back my money I go look for food when I asked her about something to eat. I was hungry since I didn't take any lunch. That statement made me lose appetite and I told her I dont need the money she can keep it. 

Not that I dont treat her nicely because I do. I always make sure she never lack I buy including her tampons. Valentines I was busy with work I had a time sensitive thing we couldn't go on a date but I bought some flowers chocolate ice cream some snacks and sent them to her at the office.

**January 5**

“Can you fill the cup with espresso shots again?”

*Oh god, she’s back*. The eldritch being that adds energy shots to a venti cup full of pure espresso.

The first time was terrifying. Now, it’s routine. Gold dollar coins, immaculate posture and business attire. She’s always perfect.

I show her the price, she reaches into her purse and lays the coins out with a single motion of her hand. She smiles at me. I see a hint of what may be a mouth full of shark teeth. I smile back.   *She is so polite, it is easy.*  Her head tilts.  I was staring again.

“Oh, yes, sorry.” I begin making her elixir. While I do so, she pulls out a phone and begins to tap on it.  I notice it is one of those old Nokia cell phones. Her thumbs fly over the keyboard in some otherworldly display of speed as she taps out her message. Smiling constantly to herself at what she is sending. She puts the phone away and waits.

I bring her enough caffeine to give an elephant a heart attack and place it in front of her. I have never asked her for her name. Maybe my instincts told me it would give her a reason to ask for mine. That scared me for some reason. Weirdly, I had forgotten my name tag or lost it the first 3 times she visited. Now I always leave it off on Wednesday. Safer.  So far, it’s worked for me.

“Here you go. Thanks again for visiting.”

She takes a sip of the drink and sighs. Politely walking over to the tip jar, she drops another golden dollar into it.  She winks at me. I smile. My cheeks are hot. *She really needs to stop doing this to me.  She’s making me question my preferences.* 

As she begins her perfect walk back to the door, a man appears in a business suit. Black shirt with a perfectly fitting black suit and a blood red tie. He and she talk. She nods once and then turns to look at me. My cheeks are on fire.

The gentleman walks up. “Can I have a cup filled with espresso? Add energy shots too?”

*Oh god no.*

“Of course. I assume she told you it was bitter?”  I tilt my head to the woman and smile.

“Yes. I also don’t care about the taste.”

This man, if he is one, is over 6 feet tall. He still has his sunglasses on and is perfectly maintained. Not a hair is out of place, no lint, dust, hair, or anything to mess up the look. I look outside, it’s windy. *I’m pretty sure he couldn’t look like this after walking in that.* My mind recoils from the implication.

I tell him the price. He produces a black card. The register accepts it. I don’t see the name of the card. It is blank. This has never happened before. Not my problem.

“I’ll have that in a minute. You can wait over there.” I begin pulling his “drink” and he stands perfectly still. He isn’t breathing. I hand him his drink.  He smiles and his mouth is full of needles for a split second before they are perfect teeth. If I wasn’t used to this, I would have doubted myself or been terrified.

He politely walks over to the tip jar and drops in a silver dollar. Then he walks over to the immaculate lady and they walk out together.

*I hope they are a couple because if either decides to flirt with me, I am so screwed. My curiosity might win and I know that I will vanish.*

Mom said moving to the city would get me killed. I doubt she thought it would be by Fae living here.

 

**February 9**

I’m not at the counter today. I know something is wrong, but I can’t figure out what until I hear something that turns my blood cold.

“Yes, we can fill that all. Weird, the system has that listed as a Pat special, Winter’s Delight?  Cool name, Pat.  Anyway what is your naaammmmmmmmmmmph”

My hand moves faster than it has any right to as I put it over Jackie’s mouth and the other over her name tag. *I* ***HAVE*** *to protect her.*  I realize a little late I must look insane and I am inadvertently groping her.

“We need to know what to call out so that you know your drink is ready, Miss. What should we call out?”

For the first time in our months of interactions, she directs a smile at me that, for once, ACTUALLY  touches her eyes.

“Clever. You may call out Mab. Thank you…?”

“You may address me as Pat.”

Her eyes glint. She knows we both shortened our real names. And she just told me who she was. My veins run cold. I have been researching Eldritch and Fae beings for months now. I figured it might help in dealing with a regular that was… well, not human. This look told me it paid off.

*Before me is an entity that is never to be trifled with*. Oh boy.  She isn’t just a Fae being.  She’s royalty.  She isn’t just any royalty.  Winter Court.  The ones that are vicious on a good day.

“We will get that right out to you, my good lady.”  I give her a little bow and pull Jackie aside.

“Listen, her and the man in black are NOT to be asked their names. Got it?”

“Um, where is this coming from?”

“Your manager. Me.  The person that will fire you if you break this rule.  They are regulars and have very distinct tastes and requirements for how we treat them. They are great customers and I want them pleased. DO NOT ask for their names. If they ask you what yours is, franchise policy is nicknames or first names only. And with those two, you tell them they can address you by that name. It’s your first week, so you haven’t gotten them before. But this is covered in the supplement manual I gave you. Did you read it?”

“Um…”

“Jackie, do not screw this up. I can handle them if you are unsure, got me?”

“Yes.  Um…  can you stop groping me?”

“OH CRAP!  I AM SO SORRY!”

“It’s okay, just kinda disconcerting is all.”  She is looking anywhere but at my eyes.

“Good. Take off the nametag, we need to get rid of your last initial.  Now go get that drink ready. Remember the energy shots.”

“Okay.”  She smile and finally meets my eyes.  I see gratitude. 

“Alright, who is next… ah, hello again, good sir. Love the blue tie today.  Gorgeous.  Same as our good lady who asked for Mab to be called out today?”

“Yes. Are you going to ask for my name as well?”

“Absolutely not. I will ask what I can call out to let you know that your drink is ready. What would that be?”

“Jack will do.”

I scan my myths and… *oh fuck. Not him*.  I decide to make sure I am right.

“Is your time around here in this area coming to an end soon?”

“Now how did you know?” He takes off his sunglasses. Eyes as clear blue as snowflakes stare at me. They can’t be human. Yea, it’s him.

“Groundhog told me.”

His laugh is surprisingly warm. He looks at me and the heat I feel in my gut and lower is far too intense. I give him my best smile, hoping the burning in my face isn’t from blushing and I make sure I don’t screw this up.

“Pat is what I am called. Pleased to have been able to meet you in your short time with us.”

I look.  No other customers. Good. I need to move.

I help Jackie with the drinks. Any time I look over the two are texting on their phones. This terrifies me for some reason. Well, that and the smirks.

*Fucking Winter Court. And Mab of all people*. Well, no other people here. Drinks are ready, I am about to call out when a stupid fucking thought decides to cause me problems.

“Mab, Queen of Air and Darkness and Jack Frost, the Winter Prince.”

Both of them tilt their heads. They walk up, take their drinks and then, for the first time, don’t tip and leave. Instead, they both take out a business card and hand it to me.

“I am sorry, good customers, but business rules do not allow us to accept gifts.”

Their smiles are wide. Almost too wide.

“Not a gift. Please feel free to call upon either of us if you have need. And do continue to be an amazing servant to the Winter and the *lesser* courts.”

“I… oh.. oh no.”

Their laugh is like something that should not exist. *I am terrified and excited and… oh no, that heat should not be happening right now in my nether region.* Damn Fae.

They tip. Twice the usual. I blink.

“Make sure the young trainee called Jackie gets half, my lady.”  Jack’s voice is at odds with his absolutely cold demeanor.

They leave. Jackie walks up. “Jack is like totally my type!”

“He is not. Do not give that being your name if he asks, nor anyone else. It’s in the supplements!”

“He gave *you* his number! How is that fair?”

I show her the card. I am hoping my instinct here is correct.  She stares at it. “Why is it blank?”

I look at her. “It was a prank. Those two are big on them. Now let’s clean up a bit. The mid-day rush will be starting soon.”

I look at the cards. The writing is an electric blue that floats above the card.  It is in cursive, done by the hand of nothing human. I can barely read it, thanks to my Gen X dad forcing me to read his letters in cursive. The words are simply unforgettable.

“Clever girl, if you have need and wish to trade favors, call for me as you did today.  Mab, Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Winter Court.” 

The second card is no less distressing.  “You amuse me with your caution and bravery.  Rare to see them combine so well.  Keep amusing and impressing me.  Jack Frost of the Winter Court.” 

Two things that shouldn’t exist. *Both like me. Fuck.*

A new customer comes in. She is dressed in green dress pants and matching coat.  Even in that she looks elegant. Her skin is a honey cream color, her hair dyed to be like the leaves of autumn gradating down her back. Her eyes a hazel I could get lost in… Oh. Oh no.

“Do you have 100% dark chocolate syrup?”

“Just the syrup?”

“Yes.”

“We can certainly see. Anything to add to it?”

“Maybe an energy shot or 12?”

*FML*

 

**May 3**

One of my favorite regulars walks in. Wearing a t-shirt that looks painted on, he struts his way towards the counter.  The figure has a huge mane of hair that somehow looks unruly and perfectly maintained simultaneously and a smile that makes most women immediately need to check their panties to see if they magically melted off. He smiles at me.  I smile back.

“Can you guess, favored barista of mine?”

I sigh.  He bounced around over the last month until he found this.  “Trenta Chocolate Hazelnut Cookie Cold Brew, extra hazelnut.”

He flashes that smile all the way to his eyes. His watch catches the light and it reflects off his eyes, making them sparkle. I know better. He is using glamour.  Behind me Jackie makes a noise. I am pretty sure she would offer this entity her firstborn for a night in bed with him. He would probably consider it a fair deal.  *I am immune to such charms.  If I tell myself that, I might believe it sometime.* 

“I’ll have it ready for you soon, Obie.”

“You know it is Oberon.”

“I know I am not making the mistake of calling the King of Beasts by his name in public, good sir. Now kindly move that very nice ass in those jeans that are far too tight to the side so that I may serve our next customer, please.”

He gives me an almost cross look but chuckles, then winks and moves. *Those arms should be illegal. There should be laws against mobile gun shows like that... Crap, lost concentration*.  I hear him chuckle. 

“Good day how may I serve…. Oh… um… how may I assist you today, dear customer?”

Before me stands a 4- and 1/2-foot-tall wisp of a “human.” *Her features are beyond perfect. Slim but with curves in the right places, she has a striking beauty that makes me question things.  Again. These eldritch beings need to stop doing this to me.*   Her coat is open revealing a dress that **might** be considered legal, but it doesn’t really leave much to the imagination.  *Okay, so how can someone that thin and small have a top like that?!  HOW IS THAT FAIR?!?!*  She tilts her head a bit and smiles now.  There is no way she is human. And she is tapping her sandal covered foot impatiently.  I focus.

She looks vaguely familiar. Her smile doesn’t touch her eyes and she all but glares at me. I looked at her eyes. Hazel, almost golden. Like Titania’s. Huh.

“Iced Brown Sugar Oat [milk]() Shaken Espresso. Double the espresso shots.”

“That’s 6 shots.”

“I said what I said. Or are you too stupid to comprehend your own tongue?”

“My apologies. I did not mean to offend, merely confirm.  People get the exact number wrong often with that drink.  What is it you wish us to call out to inform you of your order’s completion?”

“Verenestra.”

“Ah yes, thank you.”

I look around and again, somehow, no other customers. I go to work on her drink as Jackie is still busy. Jackie calls out “Obie the dead sexy!” He growls a little and checks the name on the cup. His eyes dart to me. I giggle internally.  *Yes, that’s what I put. Don’t like it?  Stop breaking the staff. I know at least 3 of them have had some “changes” in their kinks thanks to you. And put on a better shirt!*

He shifts his head a little. Hold on… *Shit, can they read thoughts?*

The soft growl combined with a purr response in my head is not spoken aloud. “Only when directed at us passionately. Do you not like the look?”  He sounded hurt.

“It is very complimentary. Too complimentary for some of the staff. You are going to turn some of them into furries.”

“What’s a furries? Some sort of goblin?”

“We are NOT having this conversation! I am almost done with the Lady of Beauty’s drink, so please do not distract me.”

I go to the counter. “The most beautiful Verenestra.”

She walks up and takes her drink. She drinks it and smiles. Nodding to me she leaves more gold coins in the tip jar and begins walking out with Oberon. They begin talking as they go.  As soon as the door closes I let out a breath I am unaware I was holding.

Jackie squealed. “Did you see her? Oh my god I am bi now.”

“That’s not how that works.”

“I have had an awakening!  Hell, you started it, groping me.  I liked it.  I shall now switch hit whenever I can!”

“Jackie, can you clean up the counter, or do you need a short restroom ‘break’ before you can help?”

“I don’t like the implications of those air quotes, Pat.”

“Am I wrong?”

“…no. Now I got so much new material for the imagination. Gonna add her in as well since I already have you in there too.  Bi awakenings are awesome!”

“I would report you to HR but then I would get in trouble.  Also, I am HR…  Just go and stop making it weird for actual queer people.”

“Be right back.”

She heads to the employee restroom and I chuckle. Cleaning up the counter always fixes my concentration issues with the King of Beasts showing up. I finish the counter and the few customers in the lobby are okay.  I have a little down time.  I decide to look at my checking account as it’s payday and I need to make sure everything is okay for bills.  I can’t really focus though.

The customer entry bell rings, I have a few seconds to tidy up and they don’t seem in a hurry. I keep working.

Intrusive thoughts suck. I can’t even concentrate on this banking stuff.  *All I can think of is how good biting the shoulder of that beast of a creature while he was on me would be… stop Patricia!!* That train of thought will cause you nothing but pain before derailing.

“You know I could hear that, right?”

Before I look up, I take a second to compose myself. I fail miserably.  My cheeks feel like they qualify as a three-alarm fire.  I really can’t handle looking at this “man” right now.  I grab my resolve and I look up. Towering above me in a Hawaiian shirt is Oberon. Grinning from ear to ear he points at his shirt with his thumbs.

“This good?”

“You did not have to do that for me, dear customer. But yes, thank you for the consideration.”

I look down. *I can’t meet his gaze anymore. It’s too much. He is being sweet for me?  I need Jackie to get the fuck out of the bathroom, as I need a turn*.  As I look on the counter a business card appears. Like the others, the writing is an enchantment. It is red, like all summer court, and pops off the page as if written on air. “Oberon, King of Beasts, King of the Summer Court, friend to the provider of Cold Brew and warm smiles. Call on me if you ever have need.  And I mean ANY need.”    *MOTHER FUCKER!*

I look up. He winks, waves with the back of his hand as he walks off and I begin to wonder if a transfer would be a good idea. Getting tangled with this is just a horrible idea. *Though damn if that mountain climbing wouldn’t be a fun experience…. Oh no*.

“Yep, I heard that one too.”

“Fuck me….”  I hear the door chime.  “I DIDN’T MEAN IT LIKE THAT!”

“I know. Have a good day, Patricia Rae Wallace.”

“You as well Ober…. Huh?”

I look down and my banking app has my full name just sitting there.

***Oh… Oh no.***

 

November 30

Life has been okay of late. For some reason I keep getting raises and title changes but still am just a manager and barista. I got a hell of a deal on a place nearby too.  It is way cheap for New York. Like too cheap. And it has a garden on the roof! I would say it makes no sense except I found out the owner of the building is Skerrit the Forest Walker, who loves his London Fog Latte with whole milk, and things made sense. He must have heard me and Jackie talking about finding a new place to live and being roommates. Suddenly we have a nice place show up and it is a steal…

Since I am the top-level manager and still behind the counter for some reason, all my staff knows to follow the rules. They are religious about it after the… incident.

Short dude wearing a red cap and Lemar fucking asked his name… We were lucky insurance covered the damages. I can’t believe he threw those rocks at us. On the other hand, Lemar has been getting great reviews of late and has stepped up. Guess having a rock fly past your ear at Mach 1.5 will up your game.

I walk in and Lemar is on duty with me today.

“Hey, Lemar, any notes?”

All of the staff have figured out a significant portion of our regulars are not “normal people.” A few have asked me questions that make it obvious they know we have Fae coming in a lot now. I would be worried about that situation, but they aren’t any worse than normal Wall Street people are. Maybe better.

“Nestra was in, ordered her usual. She seemed bummed neither you or Jackie was in.   That one really likes talking with you two.  I was super polite, because damn, but I have a hard time not trying to flirt with that one.”

“She is older than Britain and twice as jealous.”

“Britain is jealous?” He starts taking a drink of water.

“Ever look in the British Museum.”

“Fuck boss, at least wait until I finish swallowing.”

“That’s what she said.”

“Dammit! Uh-oh.”

I feel his presence before he makes a sound. It is cold. I can feel him walk up.  Then I hear him. “20 pulls of espresso, 12 energy packs. Call for Jack, please.”

“You heard him, Lemar. Winter’s Delight, for Jack.”

Lemar nods. He knows who Jack is. More importantly, he knows exactly WHAT Jack is.  Jack was the one that stopped that angry redcap. Froze his feet to the ground and then stared at him. The redcap realized he was staring at Jack Frost of the Winter Court and just began blabbering and begging for forgiveness. Lemar went ahead and searched all the terms they used when talking and well, he was white as a sheet. I had to send the poor man home. He bounces back pretty well though and he has gotten as good as I am at spotting new clients that are… special. I am making him my assistant manager.  I just gotta finish the paperwork.

“I haven’t seen Jackie of late. Is she well?”  Jack’s words are still devoid of emotion.  Well, almost.  I do hear a little concern.

“Yes sir, she has finals coming up, asked for later shifts on the days she doesn’t have class. You won’t be seeing her for morning runs except on weekends. And why did I tell you that?”

He winks. I get really angry at myself. This is such a breach of her privacy! *Why is this darling bad boy so good at prying info from me?! The only thing he would be better at prying open would be my…. DERAIL!!!!*

Jack flinches. Son of a bitch almost got info I don’t need him getting. My mental drills have paid off the last few months.  He still smiles at me.  He may catch the gist, but the mental picture is not his to have.

Lemar hands him his drink. “Jack.”

“Lemar.”

He waves as he walks out, black suit immaculate.

“Mild winter this year. I think it is because you warm him up.”  Lemar smiles at me.

“The hell does that mean?” I look at the next customer and do a double take. A woman in a light blue business suit that is far too elegant to be real stares at me. The woman’s hair is white. Most would think it is a silver/white dye job. I know otherwise. The eyes are also too clear of a blue to be human.

“Good day, madam. What may we serve our valued customer?”

She tilts her head. “You know what I am, know to be polite, and know what not to say. You are the one the Queen has complimented at court.  And yet, even with all that going for you, Patricia Rae Wallace, I have a need.”

Lemar has my back. Almost literally as I began to feel faint. She’s doing something to me. I look at her. “We can serve anything on the menu and can create special drinks.”  Stay calm, Pat.  I am being messed with and *I know this creature could kill me at any moment, but I have a job to do and I will not give her an opening if I can avoid it.*

She smiles. The temperature drops significantly. Oh boy. *Snow maiden?*

“I wish to give you a gift in exchange for one in return. I don’t need permission, do I, Patricia Rea Wallace?”

Dammit Oberon, you snitch. *Fine. Let’s get it over with*.

“Name it.”

“I need you to speak with Frost. Tell him you wish to go on a date and you wish to bring a friend. I am the friend.”

“Wait.  What?  Are you… are you seriously simping over Frost?  And you are getting me involved?!”

She looks down and her toe begins to trace arcane runes on the floor. They literally glow…. Hands behind her back, she looks like a teenager suddenly.

“No. It is just that he has been unapproachable since a mortal broke his heart. YOU seem to have lit it up again. He enjoys how you know who he is and are both terrified and fearless. He talks about you ALL THE TIME, like a love-struck puppy.”  The look on her face makes me question which one is the love-struck puppy in all this.

Lemar and I share a look. Lemar literally points at me with the most questioning expression ever to exist while looking at this Snow Maiden.  I know this looks like some panel out of a manga where they are confused at the situation, and it is comical as hell.  I’d laugh if I wasn’t so worried.

“YES HER!” The temperature drops 20 degrees in a second. *Wow*.

“Okay, but how will this work out for you?  A double date with the object of his affection isn’t exactly going to give you an opening.”

“Jack is on good terms with Oberon. He will bring him. During the double date, we will switch partners, ‘accidentally,’ and then I can speak with him.”

My mind races through that scenario.  *Every path it takes ends with me under a Fae lord screaming happily.  Some have both sharing me and one has her in there.  I reel from the possibilities, excited and so very much NOT GOING THERE!!!*

“No offense, um…?” I give her a look and spin my finger as if searching my mind for a name.

“Chione den Sneachta.”  *She fell for it?!*

“No offense, **Chione den Sneachta**…”  My smile is triumphant.

“Oh fuck.”

“That’s right, Miss. I know your true name now.”

Chione looks at me with both fury and fear.  Lemar backs up.  He looks around for a place to hide.  Maybe assistant manager isn’t for him.  Nah, if I wasn’t holding on to that name in my mind, I’d be looking for somewhere to hide with him…

“Let’s try this my way because I am seriously not in the mood to be in a bad Rom Com.”  I pull out my little business card wallet.  I have more than twenty in here.  Like 3 are even from mortals.  I find the one I want.  “I call Jack Frost, Prince of Winter, be he able, to appear to me as soon as possible, at that table.”

*POP*

“Nice rhyme, Patricia.”

“Thanks. If I am going to do something, have a little style, right?”  He chuckles.

“Okay, I KNOW that you know Chione.  She’s in the Winter Court with you.  She says you like me and she really wants to catch your eye for herself. I think you should talk to her and maybe take her for a walk.”

“Is this a favor you are asking?”

*FUCK!*

“Only if you will truly and wholeheartedly give her a chance to catch your fancy. If you would go into it with me on your mind, forget it.  No favor.”

“Done. For a favor from you?  How could I refuse?  Come, Chione, no time like the present. Want to go on a walk in Central Park with me?”

She literally glows. Literally... Like bright pale-blue light emits from her and casts shadows around her.  Wow.  She walks forward and takes his outstretched hand.

They leave.

“Boss, this isn’t good for you. That’s one of the major players of the Winter court. You know they are the more dangerous ones… and you owe him a favor.”

“I know. And it’s two, actually.  Look her up.  Oh hey, it’s snowing. Guess he is setting a mood. Hope they work out for a few centuries so I don’t have to worry about it.”

“Good luck, boss.”

  

**December 14**

It’s been 2 weeks since Jack and Chione officially started dating. She promises not to tell my name to anyone. She also said she technically owes me a favor. Gonna keep that in my back pocket. 

Jack tells me he sort of owes me a favor now. The favor he did for me shouldn’t count as it ended up being for him.  Well crap.

And that isn’t even the weirdest thing going on. Like, why do I own this franchise location now? What the hell is happening? The owner had some legal “issues” and sold it to me cheap. Too cheap.  Something about vacationing abroad to a non-extradition nation…  So now I own a coffee shop. 

And why is my place full of Fae now? Like most of the regular humans get scared if they figure it out, but a few have caught on to the rules and know to follow them.  They love talking with the Fae they meet and it figures that nothing fazes New Yorkers.  Jackie is beyond happy too. Around half of both genders are gorgeous and she is getting hit on a lot. Guess that awakening took cuz damn she and that nymph are flirting.

“Remember rule 3…”

“Yes ma’am. No dating the otherworldly beauties!”

The nymph looks a little dejected.  Hadn’t anticipated that.  *Well, Jackie is really cute.* 

She looks at me and smiles.

I smile back and the customer chime rings. It is higher pitched, telling me what kind of customer to expect. I still don’t know who to thank for that little addition. *Oh wow. Here she comes.*

“One Winter’s Delight for the customer I owe all this good fortune to?”

“Yes please. And how did you know I had a hand in it?”

“I didn’t know until you told me just now, beautiful Queen of Air and Darkness. I had an inkling and you just confirmed it.”  She gives me a look that would have sent me to an early grave just a year ago.  Now I smile and begin the ridiculous pours for her drink.

“You know how to keep me happy. Almost as much with words as with this elixir. Did you know that 35 coffee shops had told me to get out prior to me finding you? I was kicked out of 30 of them. Now, myself and many others come and have our drinks without concern for being rejected.”  She looked truly happy.

“Couldn’t you do something about them doing that?”

“Rules are rules. We must follow them or lose who we are.   But let’s also look at how you even set some rules for your employees and for our safety. They allow us to be ourselves. We can interact without the temptation to be bad as all the proper etiquette and rules are followed.  THAT, is worth your weight in gold. Here is your tip. Thank you from the bottom of this mostly empty heart.”

I smile. I somehow stop the tears coming. The Winter Queen, a creature known for being far too dangerous to deal with, has blessed me for just serving her without complaint. And she thanked me?

“I know you did not do this as a favor. I accept your kindness as one. Thank you. I owe you.”

The entire floor was dead quiet.

“Boss, you said the forbidden words.”  Jackie is staring at me in terror.  *She is afraid for me in a way that touches my heart*.  I smile at her. 

“They are not forbidden if it is true. Thank you, Queen Mab.”

Mab leans forward and whispers in my ear. I smile and present my cheek. She kisses it. I kiss her cheek back.

“A favor, well paid,” Mab smiles as she says this.

There is a riot of sound on the floor as all the Fae begin talking at once.  Titania, Oberon, and Jack all come running in. It is pandemonium as there are people throwing sums of money at one another or bringing it to Mab.

“I won the bet and got the first kiss. Everyone pay up.”

*Mab did all those wonderful things in my life to get me here so I would be so grateful that she could win a bet?*

*Seriously?!?!*

1izfddn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bacolod/comments/1izfddn/rude_kuya_guard_near_la_salle/,Rude kuya guard near la salle,"Have you guys ever encountered this rude guard somewhere near La Salle?

So, I had an encounter with kuya guard early in the morning, around 7 AM. I checked if the coffee shop where I usually get my coffee was already open, and he was like, “Ma ano ka di, to?” So I politely asked, “Open na ang kapehan, nong?” He responded in a rude tone, “Wala pa, sirado pa kami di.” I just said “Okay” and left and went inside the school.

A couple of days later, we went to the same place again around 6:30 PM. It was raining slightly, so we decided to tambay there. When we saw a vacant table, we opened the umbrella and were about to sit down na when he suddenly approached us and said, “Ma ano kamo di? Sirado na kami!” We were just planning to sit at the tables outside lang man tani, and since it’s an open area, we didn’t think it would be a problem.

Then, he called us again and asked who opened the umbrella. After we admitted that we did, he said, “Teh, pabayaan nyo lang na nga abri? Indi kamo kabalo magsira balik?” I mean, I understand that we should close it since we were the ones who opened it, but couldn’t he have asked us nicely? His tone and choice of words were just unnecessarily rude.

Earlier today, my friends and I went there again to get some coffee. The tables were already pushed to the side because it was noon. We sat down, and a few minutes later, he arrived (maybe that’s when his duty starts). Then, he asked his colleague (ig?) to move our chairs to the middle, which was the hot part of the area coz there’s no shade.

My friends and I were contemplating whether to stay or just go to the library instead. While deciding, we started fixing our things. I was still sitting, putting my makeup bag, power bank, etc., inside my bag when he intentionally pulled my chair, as if rushing me to move.

Right after he did that, I stood up and said, “Bastos ah.” I think he heard it because he aggressively dragged another chair, looking really mad.

I don’t know if he’s always like this, but this is my third time encountering him, and he’s always rude.

I reconnected with a guy friend after years—we were never close before, just acquaintances. We found out we lived in the same city, so we started hanging out, mostly in a group setting with his friends, who are all great people. Over time, I became a regular part of the group, and he seemed happy about it.

We had several sleepovers after nights out, always in a group setting. At first, we’d sleep on couches or in separate spaces. Later, we started sharing a bed, but nothing ever happened—we’d turn opposite ways, and there was always respect. One time, I got really drunk and accidentally threw up on his bed and even on him. He didn’t say a word, just cleaned up everything and made me coffee in the morning. That moment stuck with me—it made me see him in a different light.

Then one night, after a group dinner, I ended up staying over again. While lying next to him, he put his arm around me, pulled me closer, and gave me a small kiss on my neck. I liked it but got up for a minute, then came back, and we just cuddled the whole night. At one point, he leaned in to kiss me, but I shook my head no, and he didn’t push it. We kept cuddling until morning—no kissing, nothing more. The next day felt a little awkward, but we never talked about it, and things went back to normal.

After that, we kept hanging out, and I ended up sleeping next to him again, but this time he didn’t touch me. Later, we had a minor drunken argument, but we never really addressed it. Then he left for a vacation, and it’s been three months now—we still share memes occasionally, but we’re not in constant contact. I still hang out with his friends, but ever since that cuddling night, I can’t stop replaying the scenario in my head.

I don’t know if I actually like him or if I’m just attached to the feeling of that night. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t feel the same way—he’s not into dating or relationships, and he’s never given any sign that he wants more. I don’t want to bring it up and ruin the friendship, but I also don’t want to keep thinking about it. It’s been months, and I still miss him and feel happy whenever he’s around.

I feel stuck. Any advice? (And hopefully, no judgment.)

But in my last collector box there were 3 blank cards. I’ve seen these posted before but wondered if there’s a reason for it. 

I have a theory but I’m not sure. I know with other collectible cards people will weigh the packs/boxes because special cards weigh slightly more. So if a pack weighs a gram or two more there’s a good chance of a special card. Do you think this is the case with Cardsmiths? Is this their way of preventing that from happening?

# Inside the Door . . .

# One of a series of Door County homes

*The weekly feature “Inside The Door” is usually written by Women’s Editor Frances Badtke, but due to icy roads and plenty of work at the office she has asked Keta Steebs, roving reporter from Sister Bay to fill her in with a few house stories from that area.*

*The first of several Keta will do is today’s story of how Mrs. Jake Kodanko redecorated her home around a $4.88 lamp.*

*She can also cook and see today’s “Pantry Door” for Mrs. Kodanko’s recipe for Onion Pie.*

\* \* \*

Look closely, men, at that simply made, plain little lamp sitting so primly on the chest in the accompanying living room photograph. Mrs. Jake Kodanko bought it for $4.88 and Jake had to build a room around it.

At least that’s the reason Annabelle gives for talking her husband into an extensive remodeling campaign; one which not only gave her a beautiful new living room but which also included a renovated kitchen, spacious entry hall, commodious closetspace and an indoor stairway. Jake managed to work in a new office for himself.

The Kodankos, whose attrac­tive apartment is located over Jake’s garage and working quar­ters (he's in the excavating business in case someone from Borneo is reading this paper), are a hospitable couple who love to entertain.

Anne’s lack of cupboard space in her old kitchen and its in­convenient outside staircase leading directly into it were prime reasons for overhauling the entire apartment. She also wanted an open-beamed living room and this was the only way she could get one.

The results are outstanding! Antique birch paneling, carefully chosen because she “likes lots of knots”, enriches persimmon carpeting and nubby, ivory drapes. Warm, highly polished woods accent both the judiciously placed “greenery” and her original, vividly splashed paintings which highlight one wall. It’s a room you hate to leave, maybe because the furniture, described by its owners as early ‘mishmosh’, is so comfortable.

Almost every piece of furni­ture in the living room has a history, including the $4.88 lamp, which was one of a set marked down when its mate fell on top of it, breaking itself into a thou­sand unsalable pieces and slight­ly damaging the base of its sur­viving partner. Anne cagily turns that side toward the window, where only a 12 ft. tall window peeper would notice it.

She rescued her handsome storage chest from its original owners just as they were loading it on a truck to haul to the dump. It now excites more com­pliments than its newer, far more expensive companion pieces.

“I love working with woods; the older the better,” Anne says. And, after viewing her hundred year old dining room table from which she, personally, had re­moved nine layers of paint, one is inclined to believe her.

Ladder back chairs, coffee cable, end tables, what-not tables — all have felt (and show) the painstaking care of loving hands rubbing their aged and tarnished surfaces into a glow­ing new life.

The Kodanko kitchen is a jewel. It’s easy to work in, cheerful and compact. It’s Annabelle’s favorite room. Spritely wallpapers covers one wall and ruffled curtains frame a deep-set window built to hold “lots and lots of plants.” Mrs. Kodanko designed the room and spent a solid week, tape measure in hand, laying out space for her butternut cup­boards. She ended up with two drawers too many and still can’t figure out where she went wrong. Needless to say, she isn’t complaining.

The old living room (which wasn't good enough for her $4.88 lamp) is now a family room with one end set apart for formal dining. A huge, hand-braided rug nearly covers the oak floor and Anne’s own art work hangs on the wall. This is the room, David and Bonnie Kodanko, call their own. Here they view television, do their homework (David is in the sixth grade, Bonnie in the second) and play with “Puddles,” their thoroughly housebroken dog, who wasn’t always that way.

David’s “ski-hill snack allow­ance” has been sharply curtailed this month due to his habit of practicing dartball on one of his bedroom walls, without bothering to put up a dart board. His parents are waiting for him to save enough money to at least putty the holes before they re­decorate. Fortunately, his ranch oak bunk beds, desk and chest have emerged unscathed, as has the wall covered with Packer pennants.

Cedar paneling sets off Bon­nie’s typical little girl’s room, with her two favorite dolls playing key roles in the overall decor. Both costumes blend with a gay Walt Disney spread and matching drapes. An overflowing toy chest doesn’t blend with anything, so that is one reason it’s almost shoved out of sight on the picture.

The master bedroom is almost as large as the family room. A hand crocheted spread fully covers the double bed and the matching scarves draped casually on the chest and dresser are further proof of Annabelle’s love for heirlooms. All three pieces are gifts from her mother.

Her own handiwork is evident in a smartly upholstered, chintz covered occasional chair which is, she says, “The first job I ever tackled.” Its professional workmanship would do an up­holsterer credit.

A muted beige wallpaper was chosen to harmonize with warm, maple furniture and as in all rooms in the Kodanko home, or­iginal works of art (many by her friend, Anita Beckstrom) grace the walls. This room would have been photographed if it weren’t for an unphotogenic radiator which one of these days “is going to go.”

A guest house “Inn Debt” pro­vides comfortable accommodations for numerous summer visitors who enjoy dropping in for a day or two. The welcome mat is al­ways out at the Kodanko resi­dence, except at this time of year, when they do a little visit­ing themselves. Jake has just returned from a business trip to San Diego; Annabelle from visiting her sister in Oklahoma City and the two of them are leaving shortly on a Caribbean cruise.

They’ll undoubtedly be bringing home souvenirs, but Jake, for some strange reason, says, “Buy anything but lamps, Annabelle, buy anything but lamps.”

TL;DR: Reconnected with a guy friend after years, started hanging out in a group, and occasionally shared a bed platonically. One night, we cuddled, and he tried to kiss me, but I said no. Since then, nothing romantic happened, but I can’t stop thinking about that night. He’s not into dating, and I don’t want to bring it up and risk the friendship, but I also feel stuck and can’t move on. Looking for advice.

With AI adoption jumping from 56% to a whopping 69% among small businesses in just one year, according to Goldman Sachs, it's clear: AI isn't the enemy; it's the quiet partner saving businesses time and money.

But let's pump the brakes on the utopia dream for a sec. While AI trims hours off mundane tasks and lets entrepreneurs pay a living wage, could it also be training employees into obsolescence? Are humans next on its list of ""routine processes to optimize""?

Forget the weeks of labor and eye-watering invoices from traditional consulting firms; ARI can whip up comprehensive reports faster than you can say ""synergy.""

**The Magic of ARI: Efficiency on Steroids**

While typical AI tools struggle to juggle 30-40 data sources, ARI takes multitasking to a new level, processing over 400 at once. It's like having an army of coffee-fueled interns working round the clock, but without the HR complaints. ARI doesn't just spit out data—it delivers interactive visuals, ensuring even the most data-averse executives can make sense of it.

**Breaking Down Barriers—And Budgets**

ARI is democratizing access to professional-grade research. Whether you’re a startup in a garage or a Fortune 500 giant, getting insights has never been this accessible. Companies like APCO Worldwide are already integrating ARI into their platforms, transforming cumbersome research projects into real-time intelligence streams.

**From Healthcare to Media: Industry Game-Changer**

ARI’s impact spans industries. In healthcare, it's turbocharging the synthesis of medical data. Media outlets are discovering new narratives at lightning speed. And in finance, ARI is turning market research into an espresso task, not a decaf drag.

**Is AI The Future of Consulting?**

Sure, ARI can’t shake your hand or take you out for an overpriced dinner, but its efficiency and accuracy might make you rethink your consulting budget. With You.com collecting $99 million from heavyweight investors, AI research agents are poised to set a new standard.

We used to live in the same city and we had coffee by default every week, at least once per week. She moved some time ago to another city and after that we slowly stopped interacting that much. I didn't like this and it seemed ridiculous to let friendship slip away just because she moved, so I was the one who insisted on facetiming, calling each other but it seemed like I'm the only one doing it. Few times I restrained myself from calling and a whole month or two would pass. And then when we facetime again, she acts like no time had passed.

Even while we were in the same city I always felt like I was the one who initiated things in our friendship. I was somewhat okay with this because I know there is always someone who is taking more inititiative but I started getting a bit awkward.

She even once forgot my birthday and I was hurt and mad at her and I told her that. She apologized and we moved on. On the other hand, I was always that kind of a friend who will really put myself into preparing a gift or offering to be the one coming somewhere near their house to grab coffee, hang out. And I didn't expect the same things in return, I am the creative friend, but you must agree there is a bare minimum. Example: you can always buy a greeting card for someone's bday, in any store, and she would write a ""card"" to me on a piece of paper ripped from a notebook.

Now let's get to the main story.

I've been sick for couple of weeks now, like a dooog... I don't remember I've ever been sick this long and this much. Unfortunately, this friend of mine was getting married and I couldn't go sick. I was devastated because of this, I really wanted to go, but I couldn't. I caught some crazy virus and I'm still not fully okay, not even after a month. Anyhow, I had to let her know I can't come and I racked my brain trying to find right words because I assumed she would be sorry too. I wrote her a long long message, pouring my heart out (I couldn't speak, soar throat) and I told her how sick I am and how long... She reacted fine, it was okay. 

But the thing bothering me is the fact that she knows how sick I am and it's been days since the wedding and she didn't bother to send a msg and ask how am I holding. She doesn't care, simply. And this wouldn't be so odd if she wasn't a kind of friend who is always so full of joy and love and expressing love towards me, talking about how much she appreciates our friendship and how we are basically a family etc.

She not bothering to send at least one msg to see how I was doing shows me that she doesn't care (enough or at all), and seeing the entire picture tells me that maybe I care too much and I shouldn't. I tried to recall when was the last time we facetimed and it was about two months ago. And I started thinking when was the last time before that.

The reason why I ask am I too harsh is that it seems to me the majority of people is very superficial with their emotions and relationships. I've been seeing that my entire life but I always got back to couple of people who gave me hope not all people are like this. Now even those people show me the same. 

I am really thankful to ME and myself for learning how to be by myself and how to make my life entertaining and interesting on my own. My happiness does not depend entirely on someone else, but at the end - I'm just a human, I do get hurt.

My conclusion was that maybe things turned out just as the supposed to. I did feel sorry for not going, but maybe I shoudln't have been going in the first place.

Am I too harsh? Should I take friendships more lightly? I don't know how to love just a little or to halfass care about someone.",1,1740660974.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False
1izf2be,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1izf2be/my_35m_gf_29f_gives_away_all_her_money_to_her/,My (35M) GF (29F) gives away all her money to her best trans friend (33M>F). How do we go on?,"Been together for more than 2 years, my girlfriend spends about 2 hours on the phone with her best (only) friend of over 10 years who is trans every single day. She moved into my apartment during our 5th month of dating. Things turned out pretty well. She is very smart, kind and thoughtful. She's been financially supporting some of her ex-""boyfriends"" who didn't love her back (she needs to care for someone). She says I am the first boyfriend who really loves her and she crazily loves me.

Since we started dating she's been giving away about half of her salary to her best friend. This friend is very lazy, has never been employed, literally does nothing but drink coffee all day, doesn't tidy up, does nothing but call my gf all the time. Also is very toxic talking sh!t about everyone all the time, has no friends, and it's really hard for me to stay around her long (and I am really patient...). Also lost her parents 4 years ago which is why my gf feels obligated to help her. Is also said to have phobias and can't even go out of the house alone. That friend is objectively not good looking, has balding hairline, and if there would be an entitlement scale she would be a 10. The only time that friend dated someone was a LDR five years ago for a few months with a boy who left her as soon as they tried to sleep together (she has male genitals).

My gf goes to this friend's hometown twice a month for half a week to buy her stuff and do things for her. They constantly fight, many times my gf came back crying on my shoulder saying she's been hurt but then the next day gets better and goes on as if their fights never happened. My gf says fights make her more resilient as a person.

Lately her friend has decided she wants to live abroad as an end-all solution. They went together to one of the world's most expensive cities and my gf pays for everything, paid twice for 20 days airbnb and 10+ dates for her friend to go out with a paid male escort (one night would cost around 6 nights for an average airbnb in that city which is about half a regular salary in my country). My gf says this is the only way for her friend to leave her comfort zone (my gf is always around them on their dates most of the time).

So I told my gf I want to spend more time with her going to places, doing stuff and not just staying home (I work at home and am sick of keeping the house tidy, cleaning, cooking, etc.) but now she says she has no money. I just started a second job just to be able to pay for my gf's parts and sponsor a huge trip around the world but as soon as I understood how much money she's giving her friend I told her that I am against giving her money as I don't want my money going towards that friend unless that friend finds a job first. My gf said she really hopes for the entire situation to change and can't leave her friend after all they've been through as they are possibly very close to the ""end"". I really don't want them to stop communicating - on one hand because I hate to tell people what to do, and on the other because she's her only friend and my gf is a codependent person and if they are not friends anymore she will stick like glue to me.

Lastly, my gf kept all of this as a secret from me during the first 1.5 years of dating. I even started to see a psychologist to find a solution as I really don't want us to break up and I don't know what to do anymore. She calls me, as well as most other people on this planet selfish, for not ""helping"" others like this. Told her I don't think she is ""helping"" her friend because she is only reinforcing bad patterns and her friend might have been fine by now without any financial support from my gf.

Like some psy-op experiment or something to make us spend more. Hear me out:

* **Drip coffee?** You stand. No chair. Maybe if you’re lucky you get the tiny little window bar but mostly you just have to lean like a broke fool. No back support for the cheap. Beat it.
* **Espresso?** Ok, you get to sit but only on those one buttcheek stools. You know the ones. Uncomfortable AF. You drink fast and leave. That’s what they want.
* **Espresso-based beverages (lattes, cappuccino, flat white):** You get a real chair. Not a good chair, but a chair. Probably wobbly. Maybe stolen from a Jack in The Box  in 2003. But it has a back.
* **Blended drinks (frappucinos, blended strawberry lemonade.)** Oh now you get the couch. Cushions. Luxury. They want you to stay. You spent $11 on a milkshake, you’re a VIP. You get to sit comfortably. Also, your drink takes longer to make so you won’t complain as much if you are reclining.
* **Cake pop or sad bag of chips**? Barista makes soft eye contact. No chair. No benefits. Just quiet acknowledgement.
* **Mugs, bean coffee and other merchandise**? Don’t even. They look at you like you’re a stray cat.

Anyway, I don’t if this real but one time I saw a guy with black drip coffee in a nice chair and a barista straight up walked over and said “are you sure you ordered that?” and now I wonder if this is the new policy under the Chipotle CEO.

I’ll be studying in Fukuoka in September 2025 for a year and was wondering if there are any other students going there or currently there? I’m 23, non-binary and from England and actually super nervous about feeling isolated in Japan after living in Yokohama short term previously and having this problem :( I studied there but didn’t hit it off with anyone in my dorm which was actually really really devastating for an extrovert :’) 

Because of this I’m really struggling to feel excited, despite loving Japan and what I study. I really want to sink my teeth into Kyushu and make the most of it, but I’m seriously dreading it. Isolation in Japan feels so much more deep than it does being at home. I think it would be of comfort to me to make some connections before getting on that plane (if possible lol)

Bit about me- I cosplay and make my own costumes, queer, very interested in hiking and exploring, both new places and new coffee shops. I study Japanese so that’s probably the biggest interest I have. I occasionally paint/draw and would love to get back into that. 

For students already there, please tell me your favourite thing about Fukuoka/Kyushu :) I really want to start feeling excited about this!!

Woke up in extreme pain. Like the exact pain as an attack. Was told there was no evidence of a left behind stone. I'm not even sure how she could have told me that right away but I didn't question it. Was sent home.

 For the next three days I played it safe with food. I ate nothing that I couldn't handle before surgery. So saltines, pb toast, banana and decaf non dairy coffee. (One on second day and one on third.)I was pretty achy to be honest, so I took the oxycodone twice a day and it seemed to help.

Day four and i decide I will try to stop taking oxy.  Had a banana when I woke up which seemed fine and then 1130 had some toast with peanut. By 1145 I was on the phone with 911 and taken by ambulance to the hospital. This was by far the worst and scariest attack to date. 

Anyways. My liver levels indicated that I most likely had a leftover stone so I was taken by ambulance to another hospital and waited for ercp to be done. 

The procedure was done yesterday at 4 and would you believe I woke up from it in pain?! Like more than an ache. (Also a random eye abrasion. Anyone else?) I was told they didn't actually see any stones but that they did thoroughly clean out the duct. So that means the leftover stone passed at some point?? I wish I had a more definite answer to know for sure! Especially since i woke up in pain.

Docs told me today that my liver levers are already better than yesterday so i that's an indication that the stone has passed. About to try foods for the first time in 2 days.

I am absolutely terrified this is going to happen again. And also was never definitely told FOR SURE that was the cause of my pain so I am just so scared.  Pain levels have been ok but I've had some SERIOUS acid and heartburn that isn't going away. Hopefully eating will help. 

Can anyone tell me this has happened for them and that it was smooth sailing from here? I hope this is the worst of it. I miss my daughter and my husband and I am so tired of living in fear :(",2,1740660309.0,gallbladders,8,1.0,False

For years, I knew I struggled with focus, structure, and follow-through, but I always found ways to cope. Now that I *know* what it is, everything feels heavier. Tasks drag on, I zone out in meetings, and even though I can think on my feet, I hate that I’m just waffling through it.

I’m in week 3 of a 6-week performance review at work, and I feel like I’m failing. My line leader has given me multiple chances, but every week I plan, overthink, and re-strategize instead of executing. Then, suddenly, a month has passed, and I’m scrambling to put my decks together, knowing I’ve done almost nothing. It’s crushing me—not just at work but in my relationships too. I struggle to maintain connections, to be present with friends, to follow through on personal commitments.

I’ve tried *everything*—Pomodoro, brown noise, gym, eating healthy. Nothing sticks. I latch onto new habits, interests, or even people like a shiny toy, only to lose interest weeks later. Routine makes me feel trapped. The weight of responsibility terrifies me. I want to be better, but I don’t know how.

When life gets overwhelming, I have this pattern: I quit everything—my job, my home—move somewhere new, get new clothes, start fresh… and then it gets bland again. How do I break this cycle? How do I build a future when I can’t even stay in the present? My friends think I’m successful, my mother brags about me, but inside, I feel like a complete failure.

Granted I was still growing and had less than 100 members

and my community is specifically for mom entrepreneurs

so, majority of the people I come across aren't on [Skool](https://honeysyed.com/skool) yet

or have never heard of it.

I was still determined to get a more community vibe in it.

I had heard that once you get 10 people actively talking in your community daily,

the whole community takes off and everything gets easier from there.

So, that was my goal.

and I started trying to run our own internal games for points on the leaderboard.

I figured, it was a great way to test freebies

(the ones people competed for, the more you know a freebie is good)

[**But what if your community itself could generate $10k/month without relying on games? Here’s how.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkoolStories/comments/1ip86n2/got_a_skool_community_ill_send_you_10kmonth_in/)

Back to the story:

What happened shocked me.

I tried a few different prizes like a spot on my podcast show, a sales funnel set up, a coaching session, etc.

Nothing really worked.

But we were starting to get a lot of traction with our weekly virtual coffee chats

and it seemed like THAT was what people wanted out of the community.

But... how do I get them to engage IN the actual community throughout the week?

Well, I noticed that a lot of people liked to show up to the coffee chats and they had questions and wanted help with their business.

and now that I had grown to 150 members, I figured it was time.

So, I ""tested"" the concept with the month of February

by offering lifetime free access to our new paid membership/community that had group coaching.

and everything skyrocketed.

I am ending the month with 3x the normal amount of high ticket clients, I did a pre-sale on my new low ticket community and will be able to hit my goal of 15 members by March 2nd, and everyone FOUGHT over free access. The highest person on our leaderboard is over 300+ points with the others behind her coming in at 200+.

To say i'm blown away is an understatement.

Still brainstorming what I want to offer for March's games. I want to keep up the momentum, but not sure.

I am thinking a ""content creation"" kit and sending them a 4k webcam, box light, and one of those mini microphones that clips to clothes.

If you were a busy mom that is building a business, what would you compete for?

How could we ever exist as a country without Ukraine making dog collars and pickles with our tax dollars

Among the grants Ernst’s staff discovered were hundreds of thousands of dollars devoted to literal pet projects including approximately $300,000 to a “pet tracking app,” approximately $300,000 to a “dog collar manufacturer,” and approximately another $109,000 to a “pet food packaging producer,” according to a findings breakdown Ernst’s office sent to The Federalist.

And custom carpets 

Designers including a “custom carpet manufacturer,” which received approximately $2,000,000, and two different furniture lines, which received $114,000 and $91,000 respectively, also joined in the funding frenzy.

Even foodies received their fill of American cash. A “trade mission for a condiment manufacturer” cost taxpayers approximately $94,000, a “pickle maker” received around $148,0000, an organic coffee and tea producer was handed approximately $255,000, a vineyard pulled $89,000, and an “artisanal fruit tea company” collected $104,000.

USAID also awarded a “specialty biscuit and confectionery company” around $678,000 — nearly the same number of taxpayer dollars as the aforementioned food grants combined — and a meatpacking plant approximately $319,000.

USAID “failed to provide any of these documents” to Ernst’s staff beyond the “in-camera review.” USAID also often claims national security exemptions to avoid disclosing controversial charges on its public “foreign assistance” tracker.

I’m a plus-size, creative individual with a passion for movies, art and painting, and I share my life with a delightful cat. At 5’7”, I’m looking to meet a tallish or chubby, kind-hearted man who is both emotionally mature and nurturing.

I value someone who’s worked on self-growth—therapy has helped me understand myself and others, and I appreciate a partner who understands the importance of patience, self-awareness, and continuous personal development. I’m drawn to intelligence and humor, and I admire a man who can balance strength with gentleness, offering both protection and steadfast support.

I envision shared creative adventures, like painting together, exploring art galleries, or simply enjoying inspiring conversations over a cup of coffee. I’m seeking someone who is responsible and caring, a person who takes pride in being there for the people they love and creating a warm, supportive environment.

If you’re close to my age, funny, smart, and someone who values genuine connection and growth, as well all the mentioned above, I’d love to connect. Let’s explore the city and enjoy this upcoming lovely time of the year!

We communicated daily for almost 4 months, occasionally meeting up for a walk.

She had an unconcealed relationship with a man who she was deeply dependent on and who controlled her constantly. She want to not see him and he brought her to tears and she wanted independence but couldn't kick him out of her house.

I gave her for the new year a gift in the form of an expensive microphone for recording her author's songs. Recording music was part of her dream. 

But she refused it. I started to find out why, because I realized that it was not about the price. And the person with whom i had been sincerely and cordially communicating before - began to accuse me of wanting to manipulate her, of stalking her and ""taking her to pieces"", and that she's an open book and no one understands her, including me. I told her that she was acting this way because I caused her trauma and that I didn't want to fight with her because of this. But she responded by saying that I didn't know anything about her, etc.

She was going through a period of depression and burnout. I had been through a lot with her and we treated each other with understanding and care. She thought I was a wonderful and caring guy. I brought her coffee at work, gave her flowers at her concerts, etc.

However, after that fight, I apologized for the pressure, asked her if she wanted to continue communicating, she said she would be uncomfortable now and asked me to give her peace.

It's been 2 months since then. Before I left for the war zone, I wrote to her that I appreciated her and the relationship we had and apologized again if I hurt her. But she just blocked me.

1izells,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1izells/help_me_find_the_best_coffee_rest_container/,Help me find the best coffee rest container,"I know there are different kinds but I cannot find one that ticks all my boxes. For ""normal"" use I have normal airtight jars that can hold up to 200g (max 400g the taller ones, they are twice as tall as the medium ones in the picture, old picture)

It was never an issue before but now I roast less often AND/because I roast bigger batches since I switched to the Bullet (amazing machine). So I am trying to choose a ""universal"" container that will keep the whole batch (right from after roasting, so including degassing window), from which I then take out the 200g every time, that go in the smaller jars on the coffee corner.

At the moment I am dumping the batches (after roasting) in big airtight bags with one way valves (normal coffee bags) but those are hard to clean and darker roasts will still have them smell until the next roast and I feel bad using a new bag for every roast (it's also not cheap).

I was thinking of ""modding"" a big jar (like a huge yogurt plastic container with lid, that can also be washed between roasts) by cutting a hole on top and placing there a one way valve- The disadvantage is that volume cannot be changed in that case (you can squeeze a bag to let air out but not a jar or plastic container), meaning that if it's half empty, half of it will be air and not really helping against oxidation.

I know there are air displacement jars that push air out (so it will always work, doesn't matter how full they are) but I need something that can ""host"" all roast sizes from the smaller batch (let's say 300g roasted) to the biggest one (let's say almost 1 Kg roasted, which I anyway never do) and can be reused every time - means possible to wash / clean, doesn't retain smell or silverskin etc.

Any idea?

The alternative is just putting the beans somewhere and just brew them before they go stale (which is also already the case), using multiple smaller containers (let's say split all batches in 200g containers so they get opened only when I need a 200g batch for the counter) but I don't know, I would have really liked a universal solution for all batch sizes, bean quantity-independent and for unlimited use (I don't consider coffee bags completely unlimited because they do get dirty and the irregular shape makes washing / drying not ideal)

After Neil capitulated, licking out my sticky sex, begging to be allowed to remain part of my life….. there was a five week gap. Yes, five weeks and it was probably a time of hell for poor Neil. He looked so drawn and haggard! I was dating Leon (of course) and, at my lover’s instruction, I wasn’t explaining very much about our reaction to Neil’s abject submission. Of course I dressed sexily to go out with my man and there were some nights when I slept over at his place. Neil never knew exactly whether I would be home for supper, whether I would even be there for breakfast.

Naturally Ellie our daughter wondered why I was away so much and I explained that I was busy with the new work. I had given up nursing and worked now as an interior designer, so I had to travel a lot and work odd hours. It was vital to reserve our adult lifestyle from Ellie, so we kept those moments when Neil silently licked me out very much to ourselves. Neil was too embarrassed to ask, too unnerved to ask about my date, or what next, but he would look at me with pleading eyes and when I said ‘alright’ he would slide down onto his knees and delicately lick my well exercised sex. It was sweet, sensuous, toileting sometimes, like he was my maid. Once he had licked all the excess spunk from my sex, he would then draw me a bath, or set out clothes that I wanted on the bed. It was silent submission and very very generous.

I’d required Neil to sleep in another bedroom as the master was to become my boudoir. That was something that I insisted on. Still working to keep such intimate things clear of Ellie I explained that daddy snored a lot. Still, Margaret (mum in law, remember) picked up on it saying that she had been told that daddy had to sleep in another room. It alarmed Margaret, I know that it did, and so we moved towards the meeting, the summary of new life terms that Neil would have to accede to if he was ever to stay. Leon and I had discussed them a lot and we went back to the Boathouse pub for what Leon called the marriage armistice. Neil would surrender what being a husband really was and become something else, a supplement, a support. Leon would become my partner. Once Neil had submitted to the terms, once we started to live our new way, then I could better deal with Margaret and her concerns.

You might imagine that these arrangements are based on an ever growing list of rules. The trouble with that though is that rules rarely capture the evolving circumstances of new living, they either grow like topsy to cope or else lead to despair when someone like Neil doesn’t know how best to behave. So Leon said that we should instead live by five principles and that once a week Neil should have permission to ask about their evolving interpretation. He should alway address his concerns to us both, there was never to be divide and rule measures used.

I remember that Neil was at the pub first and seated out on the deck, privately apart from others, when Leon and I arrived in his Porsche. I wore skinny jeans, cavalier black leather boots and a black blouse with balcony bra. It was a bit vamp, but it did seem to make me look other, beyond reach to Neil when we arrived. I noticed that he bowed his head to Leon as we met and went to get us the drinks we requested. The smallest gestures create a frisson and that one did too. I liked it that Neil was submitting to Leon. I wanted this to proceed and to begin on firm ground. Promise, if you are a bitch, whilst there are moments of doubt, there are moments of great conviction too!

When the drinks were brought back, Leon waited. The sun was setting over the Severn and lamps had been lit outside. It wasn’t cold, but it was slowly growing dark and intimate. I wondered what Neil would say, how he would couch his submission? When it came it was simple, sort of sweet and very direct.

‘Look… Leon, I… I accept it all. Chloe loves you, she wants to be with you. I need to be something to her, I need something in support of Ellie too… please don’t make Chloe divorce me.’

I wanted to console Neil, to touch his hand or something, but clearly that could confuse. I knew that Leon had to be the boss now. The men had to relate, in a proper way. I would have to explain that, somehow, later, to Margaret.

‘OK’ drawled Leon. He seemed easy, completely unphased by this, his victory over the other man who for years I had assumed was enough for me. ‘But there are going to be five principles you live by man, and you ask about them, petition regarding them, only when you speak with us both.’

So… here they are. They’re the principles that I deftly summarised with Margaret in another conversation, a week or two later, walking in a park, my mother in law fretting and questioning as we walked.

**Leon and I always first**

This one seems abstract I know but its grounded in several requirements. That Leon and I have sex, as much as we want, wherever and whenever. Neil has to accept that I have chosen and Leon has won. To symbolise that, (this is important) Neil was to wear a cock cage. Of course I wouldn’t let Neil fuck me, but it was way more psychologically powerful than that. It stopped Neil from easily, satisfyingly masturbating. It stopped him using us to work out a shandy fantasy.

Leon and I would always be the primary sexual actors, the players if you like. Caged cock, Neil would be less, something lower league. Neil would come, with supplicant mouth to my sex, hands behind his back. When he was ready to, when he needed to, he would be allowed to suck Leon’s cock. We would consider Neil’s applications to watch us fuck, to co operate, but it would all be on the basis of humility. Leon assured me that denied relief Neil would cry quickly accept that I was too good for him and work to please us. I had no reason, given Leon’s experience, to doubt that assessment.

There was another expression of this principle though, one subtle but equally powerful. Neil was never to ‘bad mouth’ us, our lifestyle to others. His capitulation had to be complete and reinforced by approving, supportive, respectful words and acts that celebrated what we explored together. I remember how Neil flinched at that. Right thinking, right speaking would be much harder than simply doing sex in a supplicant way. Leon tested him a moment later.

‘So why is Chloe with me rather than you then?’

I watched Neil’s face colour red in an instant.

‘Because you’re better than me… because she’s too good for me’ he stammered. Still…. he got the words out.

I remember Neil looking at me after he spoke. He wondered whether I enjoyed seeing him humiliated. I did. I know, that’s awful. But cuckold sex feeds on many things.

He asked us about babies. He had read about ‘breeding’. Leon smiled and squeezed my hand. ‘Way ahead man, a deeper level of commitment. We’ll talk again as necessary.’

Neil seemed relieved.

**Humble Neil involvement always promised**

You cannot leave a cuck out in the cold, provided that he is humble. Leon explained that. The menage a trois is fed three ways, cuck and mistress, the alpha lovers and cuck and master. No matter how masochistic a man might be, he has to be engaged, to be nurtured in some way, over the longer term, by the new living. Of course, in its simplest terms that was Neil being allowed to lick my sex when he had behaved well. It involved being allowed to suck Leon’s cock ready to take me, or to clean it after inseminating me. That which seemed dire, dirty, disgusting, had the potential to feel fulfilling, engaged, exciting and intimate, once Neil’s mind was reframed.

Leon was fucking me as he explained it. I had to be a bitch to Neil so that he craved recognition and then when that was granted, it always had to celebrate Leon and I. The intimacies swirled around and around, but whatever the role, however humble it was, it had to have a purpose that the parties wanted. I felt Leon ejaculating hard inside of me, my sex spasming hard on his shaft.

‘He’s to lick your balls whilst you fuck me’ I moaned.

‘Yeah!’ groaned Leon.

‘He’s to be welcomed in to that, to be required to do it?’

Leon grunted loudly. I was still so snug and tight on him.

‘When we want it, but regular enough bitch, OK?’

I kissed him eagerly. His power Made my head spin, the strength of his mind, his iron attitude.

Of course if Neil wasn’t humble/supportive, then he would go without. The cause and effect reaction had to be absolute, unwavering. Only by such discipline would Neil learn and assume a new identity, something dirty, daring, bohemian perhaps, something that said ‘screw convention’.

**Ellie a little princess**

We both agreed that Ellie shouldn’t be exposed to the intimacies of our lifestyle, to have it described until she reached adulthood. Children deserve childhood and they need space and time to work out their own values and preferred living. Sex is a very powerful thing, not to be ignored, but only to be discussed when a young person is mature enough to understand. That meant that sex was always to be private. For sure it would be accepted that Leon lived at our house sometimes, that he slept over. It would be obvious, required, that Neil deferred to him. But the use of terms like master, mistress, miss was something kept apart from routine home living.

I remember listening to Leon in awe as he explained this to Neil. My husband seemed so terribly grateful. He was so ashamed at being beaten I suppose. Then though Leon went on to the more practical and philosophical matters that related to the principle. First, Ellie was to be raised as a little princess, discerning and spoilt, confident in her own rights and judgements. I knew that Neil thought this meant Ellie being raised to be a little bitch when she grew up, but I didn’t care. Life should be on a woman’s terms too. Ellie would of course continue to have mixed friendships and raised to despise racism. Neil nodded.

Leon then told Neil that when Ellie was old enough she would be sent to private boarding school at his expense. there would be monthly weekends spent at home. Not only would this teach her discerning attitudes but it would ensure that she wan’t prematurely exposed to intimate lifestyle developing at home. Leon and I wanted parties, our friends around, Neil understood, didn’t he? Well, he did, reluctantly, he did.

**Public living**

The last point forewarned Neil of this one. The living wasn’t going to be a ‘sneaking around’ thing. There were hip people bold and imaginative enough to celebrate another lifestyle. I would teach Margaret how things were. If she wanted to keep seeing her grand daughter, if she wanted to check the adjustment of her son to new living, well she would go with the flow.

I know this hurt Neil, there was a huge tear in his eye, eager to run. But he wiped it aside and nodded.

‘We’ll do this gradually, sensitively,’ I told him, ‘for friends lost there will be friends gained. Some will think you so generous, so kind, so.. well considerate.’

I was touching his cheek as I spoke. Neil kissed my hand and Leon smiled.

‘It’s political Neil’ Leon said gently, ‘we need to quietly insist on the right to live another way, to enable others to fairly assess whether it’s for them too.’

Do you know how powerful that felt to me as a woman? Consider, its the right to live in different ways with two men, to assign roles and to build a disciplined way of living that enables a woman to feel doubly supported and very contented. Women have always known how to love in different ways and to share and apportion affection. Leon was stating that starkly.

**Leave with nothing**

The last principle was brutal and about now. The house was in my name, but if Neil left now, then I would allocate him a share of the property sale and Ellie and I would live with Leon. If Neil lived our way though, if he left after failing to commit to the bargain, then he left with nothing.

Neil asked me, ‘how can you know you want this so absolutely, so completely?’

I looked at Leon. ‘I know’ I said. ‘I know what I will do too if you can’t explore with us, what will be necessary then.’

It was an astonishingly brutal thing to say. But by then well into the relationship, the change, I did know.

**Margaret**

I remember, like it was yesterday, we had reached the ornamental pond, in the park, the mandarin ducks circling, when I finished describing the principles that we would live by and which her son had consented to. She wanted to call me a bitch, but that merely confirmed something I knew, even understood better than she now.

Her face was white, the silk scarf around her neck quivering as she spoke.

‘You… that man….. you’re humiliating Neil’ she whispered.

‘We’re not pretending to be happily married in the conventional way, ‘ I retorted quietly but firmly, ‘Neil and I rarely had sex, we played house and did nice genteel things like going to the theatre.’

‘You’ve made sex, your selfish needs, everything!’ exclaimed Margaret.

I nodded. ‘Have you asked Neil how much ‘sex’ he has had with me since we started living this way? Have you asked him how that compares with before?’

My companion shrugged her shoulders.

‘Dirty sex, unnatural sex…’ she insisted.

‘Intimate sex, sensuous sex, slow sex that isn’t wham bam thank you mam sex!’ I felt my temper fraying. ‘Did your husband ever go down on you? Did you ever fancy another man or even have a fling? Were you ever a sexual being after the wedding was done!?’ My voice rose.

Margaret looked shaken.

‘Sorry!’ I said and touched her arm. I hadn’t planned the conversation this way. I hadn’t planned to argue so stridently.

Margaret dabbed her nose with an handkerchief. It would be days later that she admitted that she had never enjoyed cunnilingus, that she felt, well, ignorant. Toby, Neil’s now deceased father, had not been an expressive, a sexual man.

‘I am not abandoning Neil Margaret, I am living with him differently. He is learning to relate to Leon. We are protecting Ellie, ensuring that she has an excellent upbringing. I want you to spoil her. We want you to help her become so confident, so sure. Neil wants that.’

‘Yes… I know’ said Margaret.

‘Leon wants to meet you. He wants to take you to see Les Miserables… he has tickets for a box at the theatre.’

Margaret stared at me, her face in shock.

‘ He’ll have lunch with you alone first. Then, at the theatre you’ll be with all of us, me, Neil, so that you can learn. We don’t want you pushed out’ I insisted.

‘Do you love Leon?’ she asked.

I smiled. We don’t have modern terms do we. Not for the nuances of affection. Not even a million words for love would quite be enough.

‘Yes’ I answered at last.

‘Do you love Neil?’ she asked quietly, without challenge or malice in her voice.

‘Not in the exclusive way you have known, not in the way you may be hope for now’ I answered.

‘Sex… life, you’ve pulled them together’ she said.

I squeezed her arm.

‘We need some coffee, agreed?’

I have to tell you that explaining the above to Margaret was the hardest thing that I have ever done. It was so intimate, so private, but the understanding of it was so important. Ellie needs her grandma, Neil needed a mother who would try to understand what we did and her son contributed. There were going to need to be people who thought of Neil as brave, loving and considerate, rather than weak, sick or strange. I didn’t know how Neil thought about sex before I went with Leon. I pushed my husband into the change. It was my responsibility to help Neil through that.

1izekf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1izekf4/should_i_cut_ties_with_my_friend/,Should I cut ties with my friend?,"This friend is one of the few people who hasn’t pushed me away because of my autism. She’s always been understanding and has tried to support me. In fact, she even wondered if she might be autistic too because we had so much in common, and she understood me perfectly. We’ve been friends for 9 years, and at one point, I even considered her my best friend. However, over the past 2 years, we’ve been growing apart.

When I was 20, I decided to continue my studies abroad thanks to a scholarship, and I also started working there. It was a last-minute decision that surprised everyone, and she was the first person I told because it was really important to me that she knew. We used to be inseparable—we lived close to each other, just a 15-minute bus ride away, and we saw each other almost every day.

I initially planned to stay abroad longer, but I ran into financial issues and had to return to my home country. After being away for a year, I was really excited to see my friends and family again, and the first thing I wanted to do was meet up with her to catch up. However, I was already upset with her because during the time I was living abroad (completely alone), she never reached out to me. She was always too busy for a video call, and honestly, I felt like she didn’t care about me anymore.

When I got back, we met up for a walk, and she casually mentioned that she had a boyfriend and that they had been together for a year. I was surprised she hadn’t told me earlier—it seemed like something important to share, and I found it strange that she kept it from me. I told her I had missed her and that I was hurt she never reached out first, but she just said she had been too busy and that when she had free time, she spent it with her boyfriend.

Ever since she got into this relationship, she’s been neglecting our friendship. No matter how much I try to make plans, she’s always unavailable. I’m juggling work and studies, yet I still try to make time for her, but she claims she’s too busy with her boyfriend. While I respect her relationship, it’s not a valid excuse to completely disregard our friendship. To make things worse, this year alone, she’s stood me up three times. Once, we were supposed to go to the movies together—I even bought the tickets—and the next day, she canceled, leaving me to go alone.

The breaking point was yesterday. We finally managed to meet for coffee, and I opened up to her about how I’ve been struggling lately. My 15-year-old cat has a tumor, and I don’t know if she’s going to make it. The surgery is incredibly expensive, and with the little money I earn, there’s no way I can afford it. I’ve already spent over €300 on consultations and tests. My cats mean the world to me, and she knows that. But when I shared this with her, her response was, “Oh, wow, that’s why I’ll never have pets.” Seriously? I’m pouring my heart out to you, and that’s your response? How can someone be so cold? She didn’t offer any words of encouragement or try to empathize with me. Nothing. I was so upset that I called her out for being so unpleasant, chugged my coffee, and left.

I’m seriously considering cutting ties with her because she’s become someone I barely recognize. This isn’t the person who was once my best friend. I don’t know what’s going on with her, but I can’t stand her anymore. Her attitude is honestly starting to repulse me.

I could tell you more about the unpleasant things she’s done since I came back, but this post would end up being way too long, and I don’t want to drag it out. I just want you to know that this isn’t the first time she’s acted so poorly toward me. Honestly, I don’t know what to do—I have mixed feelings because part of me still cares about her.",2,1740659204.0,autism,7,1.0,False

Like, *hit-snooze-five-times* bad. I’d read all the habit stuff—21 days, 66 days, whatever—but it wasn’t clicking.

Enter my accountability coach, Antonio (found on Reddit). He wasn’t some drill sergeant; just this chill guy who texted me every morning: “You up?” No judgment, just consistency.

**1st Week?** Brutal. I dragged myself out of bed at 6 a.m., and half the time I lied about it—“Yep, totally awake!” while still under the covers.

**By day 10**, I was actually brewing coffee instead of faking it.

**Week 3**, I stopped needing his nudge most days—my body just *knew*.

**Week 5**, I was that annoying morning person texting him at sunrise.

How long did it take? For me, with Antonio, it was about 35 days to feel solid.   
Not the mythical 21, not quite the 66-day research stat—just over a month of him keeping me honest.   
  
The coach part didn’t magically rewire me; it forced me to show up when I’d usually flake.   
  
**Studies say 66 days is average, but with him, it was faster—probably because I couldn’t BS my way out.**

Point is, a coach shrinks the timeline if you lean into it.   
  
Without him, I’d still be a snooze-button champ.   
  
Depends on the habit and how much you dodge the accountability—but with someone good, **I’d bet you’re solid in 4-6 weeks.**",1,1740659193.0,Accomplishanything,0,1.0,False
1izek9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1izek9i/morbidly_obese_first_weeks_of_keto/,Morbidly obese - first weeks of Keto,"I turned 50 last Sept. Male, 6ft tall, 382 pds in December 2024.

Additional info: was never sick for long, I'm on no meds, have no issues with my joints or back, never had surgery, have a head full of hair and don't need reading glasses. Skin elasticity pinch test snaps back in 1 second.

Only smoked on weekends (and not every weekend) in my twens at parties (cigs went well with alcohol), stopped around 30.

Only been a social drinker. In the last 20 years, except for social gatherings, I usually have 1 alcoholic drink a month, but usually none. Also the party life of our clique ended in the early 30s when we began to settle down.

I was never that fat in my life - I was a slim and active kid, I was an active teen and never overweight, in my twens I had one fat year, where I went up to 264pds and then got rid of it, peaking in my late twens around 180 when I hit the gym on a regular base and was building muscle.

In my early thirties I was fluctuating a bit - 218pds for example, but still working out a lot and being strong.

Late 30s - new job in IT - a department of programmers who were either skinny or obese - started letting myself go, taking my surroundings as excuse. It's not their fault but mine.

40s - started gaining, made up excuses why not to work out, ate processed trash.

2020 - Covid - I did not get infected. But home office made me eat more trash (another excuse, home office did not stuff a pizza and soda and a dessert down my throat), did no longer work out. After Covid I tried various diets - sometimes losing 20 pounds, then regaining them once my motivation broke. Went ""accidentally"" into keto for the first time during an interim water fast that lasted 11 days before energy fizzled out. Felt the mental clarity for the first time.

2025 - January. Had an insane hormone rush in mid January and decided it's now or never. Started Keto, tossed out all the carbs and sugar that I had in the kitchen. Began working out at home with dumbbells and taking evening walks every day.

I'm on a 3-400 calorie diet for over 2 weeks now, massive deficit. Test stripes show me relatively deep in Keto around the 0.8 mark. Lost about 30 pounds so far (not in 2 weeks, but since January). Hormone rush still lasts, I get waves of goosebumps over the day, but the good kind. Starting to feel my core and muscles again.

Yesterday's food for example:

Breakfast: black coffee, 5min egg with a pinch of salt, a Supradyn Forte (a vitamin supplement)

Lunch: spinach with a drizzle of olive oil, half of a avocado with a few drops of lemon, 10grams beef jerky, tablespoon of Greek yoghurt with 5 frozen raspberries. Collagen supplement.

3+ litres of high magnesium carbonated water over the day. Large cup of Green Tea in the evening.

When I get to roughly 310 pds I will hit my gym again instead of home workouts. Why the wait? I'm deeply ashamed of how I look, when compared to my former self. But now it's getting better every day and have not cheated once.",24,1740659190.0,keto,6,1.0,False

* **Headphones‌ for work:** ⁣Again, the XM4's noise cancellation and clearer microphone make it a better choice for focusing in a noisy office or taking conference calls.
* **Headphones for​ gym:** Neither are ideally suited for high-intensity workouts due to their over-ear design but can do the trick. You​ might want to consider dedicated sports headphones for this purpose but the *noise cancelling headphones comparison* usually leaves these two out.
* **Best headphones for music:**‌ The XM4's balanced sound and LDAC ‌support make it the better ‍choice ⁢for⁤ critical listening, but the XB910N's‍ bass-heavy sound can‌ be enjoyable for genres like EDM and hip-hop.

Overall we had an amazing time, this is a mind-blowing incredible resort. 

Our arrival was pretty smooth - we flew into Cancun airport late afternoon and found the shuttle bus quite easily to take us to the hotel. When we arrived someone took our luggage and we were asked to join a group of others checking in, and we were all given a brief tour of the hotel and taken to the reception of Casa Artistas. We weren’t supposed to be staying in Artistas but were told we could check-in there anyway for our room in Diseño or Piramide. During check-in we were asked if we were celebrating anything and we told them we were celebrating both of our birthdays and both of us completing our PhDs. We were offered a promotional price to upgrade to Artistas which we declined, and then they ended up offering us the upgrade for free because of our celebrations and because we’d travelled such a long way and it was our first time in Mexico! We were given an ocean front room with a gorgeous view and obviously could then take advantage of all the Artistas perks - butler service, access to the Artistas rooftop pool, access to Kibi Kibi etc. so that was fantastic. Nobody asked us about the timeshare/membership during check-in or at any other point during our stay and if they had, I can’t imagine they wouldn’t have politely accepted a “no thank you” when that worked for absolutely everything else we were offered that we didn’t want. 

Food - we were super impressed by the food overall. I’m kinda side-eyeing any reviews which say all the food was bad or that they didn’t enjoy any of it because there are so many different options at the resort. Sure we didn’t love everything, and there were things we tried that we disliked, but it’s all-inclusive, so we could always just order something else or go to the mercado buffet if we were still hungry and there was loads of food we loved. We went to all of the restaurants on the Arte side except Cayuco and Apapachoa. Our faves were probably Tah-Xido and Chino Poblano, but we also loved a lot of the stuff at Mercado and ate there a lot. Kibi Kibi was also great for breakfast especially. We also ordered food a couple times at the artistas rooftop pool which was great, and the cafe does great iced coffee. In terms of drinks, the cocktails are maybe not the strongest, but you can always ask for a shot on the side. You can request your drink to be made with a specific brand of alcohol and it’s no problem. We only went to the speakeasy once as we’re early to bed, early to rise people on holiday but it was a good vibe and a cool concept. 

My one critique would be that my partner has allergies to some nuts and it was a bit of a mixed bag how well this was accommodated. The host and wait staff at every restaurant asked about allergies every time, but it was then handled inconsistently when it came to actually ordering and understanding which things had nuts in. She had a great experience at Chino Poblano for example - the dishes on the tasting menu which had nuts all had a nut-free equivalent that were still delicious and planned out and allowed her to still enjoy the experience. But at Mercado, nothing is labelled for allergens, and the staff didn’t always know what was in the food. I think we would’ve been concerned about eating there if her allergies were more severe. On the other hand some servers were almost over-cautious and wouldn’t serve her any nuts (even though she’s only allergic to a few) or anything that would be cross-contaminated (when her allergy is only for actually eating).

Parks/activities - we did Xcaret, Xplor, Xenses, and Xenotes, and that felt like a really good mix between the activities and time at the resort since we were only there 7 nights. We knocked out Xenses and Xplor on the same day because it was raining all day so we wouldn’t really have enjoyed time by the pool anyway, and at Xcaret we did the activities we wanted to do (including Sea Trek which was incredible and worth the extra cost) in a morning and were back at the resort by lunch. Xenotes was our favourite even though we are a bit scared of some stuff - we avoided the cliff jumps but did everything else and it was all really manageable and fun. It was also totally fine to opt in or out of each of the activities, plenty of people in the group didn’t want to do some of the scarier stuff and it was completely OK. In general the parks and activities are all really well managed in terms of locker access, clean facilities, ease of getting around - I worried it would feel a bit manic/stressful but it wasn’t at all and it was easy to just concentrate on having fun.

Service - pretty much everyone we interacted with was super nice and friendly and accommodating. We mostly used our butlers to help with reservations e.g. they booked sea trek for us and then rescheduled it when it got cancelled because of wind. They also sent the hotel doctor to our room after I fell down a couple of stairs on our rainy day at Xplor (wet stairs + wet crocs = ouch). They could book kayaks for us on request for the lagoon which was great - the lagoon is such a beautiful feature of the resort and it was great to be able to kayak and swim in there if we were fed up of sitting by the pool. We spent a lot of time at the Artistas rooftop pool and the staff there are great, they’d move us to a cabana as soon as there was one available, they are always checking to see if you want to order another drink or need extra towels etc. We also both did the hydrotherapy at Muluk Spa and I got a hot stone massage and a facial - the treatments have to be booked directly with the spa, we did it in advance of our trip over email and asked them what packages they had available and they had different combos/prices that weren’t listed on their website. It is expensive but it was my birthday so it felt worth it, and I would recommend as it really was a lovely spa and great treatments again with super friendly staff. We didn’t bring a lot of cash for tips (and we actually didn’t see anyone tipping when we were there) but we did leave $2 per day for housekeeping, $10 for our xenotes tour guide, and then $30 for our butlers. We brought USD because we couldn’t get pesos. Other than on the xenotes tour there was never a direct ask for tips and we never felt weird about not tipping or like it was expected. 

Overall we had such a great time and would encourage everyone to take negative reviews with a pinch of salt and not to worry, it’s an incredible resort and you’ll have an amazing time. Sure, there were a couple of things that weren’t completely perfect, but ultimately this is a huge resort run by a lot of people and it’s easy for things to go wrong sometimes and not everything will please everyone. The resort itself is so beautiful and there’s so much to see and do, and it feels like everything is set up to maximise your enjoyment and comfort and quality of life during your stay. Feel free to ask any questions if you have any! ",12,1740658280.0,Xcaret,4,1.0,False
