They ran a restaurant business, and I helped them with designing banners and marketing the product. They set up shop beside another restaurant selling a different type of food. It turned out the other restaurant was using black magic, and our restaurant didn’t received much sales. We had to rely on online sales, and I was the one posting on pages to promote food delivery. But even that wasn’t enough. At some point, they gave up. We didn’t have any money left, and I had to quit my studies.

I was an excellent student, so quitting college was a heartbreaking decision. I started a small online business, but somewhere in the middle, my mom encouraged me to sit for an exam. I failed because I couldn’t focus. My head was everywhere. The situation at home was ugly. 

After the exam, I decided to stick to my business, but my sales dropped significantly, and my live viewers stopped showing up. Then the bank took my car.

Around that time, my mom started sending me job openings, telling me I needed to pay off the debt. What debt? It wasn’t even mine. Still, I worked a job I didn’t like just to earn money. Later, I found another job that paid more, but with it came more expenses. I was left with only 20% of my salary after deducting loan payments, some allowance for my parents, and rent for my own place.

One time, I decided not to give them the allowance. Partly because I was angry, and partly because I didn’t have much left for myself. just enough to treat myself to coffee to stay awake during work.. I hadn’t bought anything for myself since I started working. My mom responded by sending me posts about how “you don’t go broke by giving money to your parents,” indirectly accusing me of being stingy. And when I bought some good food for myself, my mom would tell me how I should be more frugal??

So yup, I gave them the allowance anyway.
Since then, I’ve felt myself change. When I go back to my parents’ house, it doesn’t feel like home anymore. I go because I feel obligated, but I don’t talk much. I feel sorry for them, but I can’t help but wonder do they feel sorry for me?

A few days ago, I lost my job. I haven’t told my mom because I know what will happen. She’ll send me more job ads, and it’ll make me feel miserable. The problem with her is that she doesn’t get support from my dad, so she puts all the burden on her daughters. It’s exhausting.

It’s already been 3 weeks since my last visit. I just have no heart of going back to my house, not even phone calls.",2,1733885309.0,confession,0,1.0,False

I come from arc, it was browser i settled in for a while after trying many browsers (including Firefox which i disliked for the lack of UI customization), arc worked OK i liked the UI but it still felt like corporate AI hell shoving AI down my throat... I went away mainly cause of that, it drove me nuts, but i still couldn't find a browser that matched Arc's UI... Until i randomly scrolling through reddit found a random post about UI customization in ZEN. I saved the post and the next day I was on zen, it feels great!

**\*What I like\***

I love the way the browser feels comfy, like a cup of hot coffee on a snowy December night, How it doesn't blind me every time i want to use it at the dark, how the UI choices just make sense, everything is where you expect it to be, it just feels good to interact with it. The Dev is cool (and hears our questions!) which is a big bonus for me coming from the big corporate generic New York startup that arc is. The community is helpful! And it is free of bloatware!

**~~\*What i don't like\*~~**

**\*SUGGESTIONS\***

* The new logo looks somewhat generic, something that reminds of the Z and still looks minimalist can be a good idea, i have seen great examples from the community;
* I feel that a mobile app for IOS is lacking, i use IOS myself and was somewhat disappointed to see that there isn't one available;

It’s just me sabotaging my self over and over again. I have been going to the gym on and off for almost six months now and what bugs me the most is that I always stop gouging of don’t feel like it when I get amazing results like, this summer I was going to the gym AND running at night as well, and let me them you something that must have been the best I have ever felt in years the scale was moving, I had more energy, I was pretty much happier and that’s when I started getting knee pain but I worked on that strengthening my joints at the gym so I don’t miss out on my runs, because I love the high that comes after the run and chasing that was basically why I was enjoyed that particular time. But I went to donate blood like I always do every month and I was told that my hemoglobin levels were too low. Meaning the amount of red blood cells that carries oxygen in my red blood cells was low meaning I didn’t have enough oxygen circulating in my body. Which shocked me because I didn’t fell like that at all. But then I tried to incorporate more red meat and other iron dense foods in my diet, which didn’t seem to be fruitful. But now 4 months later it seems I have fixed it. And now that I feel good I do everything in my power to avoid the gym like today, instead of hopping on the bus and going straight to the gym, I went to Timmy’s and got sour cream glazed donut with iced coffee. After getting bored of waiting I crossed the street and went to Winners. See what I mean I avoided going home early so I can’t go to the gym. What do you make of this?

1hbjifv,https://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1hbjifv/how_to_fix_throat_mucus/,How to fix throat mucus,"For a long time now, I've had borderline aggressive mucus buildup that resides in my throat and inhibits my ability to sing to such an extent that it's nearly impossible for me to get the correct sound coming from my throat. I've thought for a while that I just had cord scarring or something, as my voice is usually a bit airy and inconsistent at some times. However, I found out a few months ago, by complete accident, that this was not actually the case. I was drinking a lot of this one canned coffee one night, and I found that my airways felt unnaturally clear. Like, to the point where it was *surreal*. I felt like I had opened my eyes for the first time; singing felt and sounded amazing (as I am somewhat familiar with tonal and breathing practices, but had never personally felt the affects until now). After a few days, however, my throat returned to it's normal state, and I am still chasing that high.  
I wondered how to achieve it once again, and was reassured (as I had already known) that drinking water assists in loosening mucus. So, I started drinking lots of water for about a week, but there were no noticeable changes in my voice. Because of this, I decided to try some otc decongestants and expectorants. Separately, nothing. Together, not really. I had no idea what to do, as I was so desperate to try and relive the experience.   
After a while, I just decided that I needed it no matter what. So basically, my ""genius"" plan was to non-stop drink water all day until I got the clarity back. I'm a bit on the bigger side, so I figured I'd be fine if I drank a lot of water. Long story short, I almost had to go to the hospital because I ended up drinking over a gallon and a half of water within too short of a period of time. Still, though, this did nothing. What can I do to fix this?

tl;dr I've tried lots of water, otc expectorants, decongestants, lemon, and various teas to try to get rid of throat mucus, but **nothing** has worked. How can I get rid of it?",1,1733884997.0,singing,1,1.0,False

I want to surprise him with something unexpected that he has never owned before, but familiar enough that it won’t be intimidating. Ideally I would get a few, 2-3 travel sizes so he can play around a little bit. I’ve blown most of my Christmas budget already, so trying to keep it under $60, so clones or dupes are OKAY at this point. From somewhere that can ship to me BEFORE Christmas. 

A little about him: 
He is 36. He works mostly outside. He is the “tall, dark and handsome” type, minus the tall. He is 5’10”. He is on the rugged side. Lots of tattoos, throws axes and has a glorious beard. But, he has a very soft side. He cries at sad movies, loves clothes, candles and shopping. He is very in touch with both his masculine and feminine energy, and would like to find something that reflects that.

Maison Margiela’s Replica Jazz Club and Coffee Break. 
Imaginary Authors A Whiff of Waffle Cone and City on Fire. 
He is currently using Lush Lord of Misrule solid cologne and Sticky Dates body wash. Sometimes he borrows my Atelier perfumes for layering. 
 
I thought about just grabbing MM Replica Autumn Vibes and Afternoon Delight (both new to him) and calling it a day. But, again I want to go outside his usual.

Specifically, the arguments laid out by Saagar today in his monologue are rehashed Anti-Saloon League talking points.

The Anti-Saloon League was an organization that strongly advocated the prohibition of alcohol. Their advocacy led to the 18th amendment. Imagine instead of Online Sports Gambling, Saagar said alcohol. It'd quickly reveal a silly argument about this vice.

To be specific, the anecdote that he shared about the man who lost a million dollars is swappable with any story about a man losing his money to alcoholism, prostitutes, etc. It's not a unique story when it comes to all things deemed vices.

Yes, there are negative consequences to vices. However, if these arguments Saagar made are compelling to you, think about why they might not be if he was talking about banning only fans or delivery services for alcohol & weed.

Saving the strongest point for last, that I agree is bad in persuasive writing, is that addiction is core to a lot of modern economies. Here is a list of markets that rely on addiction and design their services and products to increase addiction:

* The entire coffee industry
* Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, even Reddit all rely on user addiction to sell advertisements
* Video games use addicting game mechanics to get users to play more of the game. The games are designed to drive users to spend money on microtransactions
* Apps like Tinder, Bumble, etc. rely on ""whales"" (a small percentage of users driving most of the revenue) to keep their businesses running
* Netflix originally used to offer rewards for ways to enhance the clickthrough rate and watch time on the site
* There are specific food categories that are designed to be addictive and are detrimental to health if enjoyed in large quantities
* Amazon designed it's website to maximize shopping addiction through recommendations
* Credit Card were specifically designed to make users disassociate with their spending
* The biggest vice of all, which impacts remain unknown, is pornography.

I'll concede that these examples are not as pernicious as online sports gambling. And that Sports Gambling has a unique high compared to other activities. However, this will only be a small portion of the negative behaviors of a secular future. In my opinion, this will not be in the top 5 of negative vices in society.

I (male) lost my virginity at 19 to another male because it was easier than having sex with a female. 

Fast forward to me fucking up my relationship.

I met a very, very nice young lady who was a virgin, we dated for 7 months, and then finally had sex. 

During the 7 months I messaged others, and met up with an old ex and I wanted to have sex, knowing it was wrong but not wanting to stop, but the ex declined due to trying to be more grown up and not wanting to hook up.

After I had sex with my girlfriend for the first time, we shortly after moved in together and I figured I would get sex often to satisfy my urges, but it never came. She was simply too shy and anxious, although we were progressing.

However, I desired sex. I wanted raw sex. I wanted sex with men. 

I wanted sex with my girlfriend the most, truly, but the desires didn’t stop to find sex elsewhere. I continued to be on dating apps searching for sex with minimal success.

Until one one day I had sex with someone else whom I deemed desirable. Did the deed and went home. 

Days later I messaged an other ex and the ex threaten to expose me to my girlfriend.

I came clean to my girlfriend. Told her the whole truth, and she was devastated.

We took “a break” and during the break I had sex with someone else again. (I didn’t realize a break meant don’t have sex with someone else. I thought it meant we’re single people, talk to you soon.)

When I told her I had sex with someone else during the break, it broke her.

Then she had sex with someone else weeks later and that broke me for about 30 minutes. But then, I decided I still loved her and asked her can we try again?

She was asking me if I had attempted to solve my sex addiction in therapy, I stated no, or at least not much. I think that caused her to think I wasn’t taking it seriously (which is justified).

I was afraid to bring it up in the sessions because I didn’t want to solve it unless she came back. So it kind of never solved itself.

The try again never came, but we still spoke off and on until she met someone new a few weeks ago, and then contact began to cease.

I have accepted full responsibility for my actions and my problems as of today and I’m working to fix them!

### Training

I had run the Indy Mini-Marathon in late May, and set a PR of 1:18:49. After a post-season involving a 10 mile race, one of my friends bullied me into signing up for a marathon. Though I knew a world major wasn't in the books (I wanted to get the run done before 2025) I settled on CIM as the only place I could realistically race.

The summer involved two races- the Brooklyn mile which I ran in 5:03 and a Tracksmith Twilight 5k which I clocked a 17:27. Both races were PRs but weren't particularly important. Rather than treating them as peak races, I wanted to lock in on my mental game before racing.

Summertime mileage was pretty consistent but a solid grind up- even with two shorter races in the mix, I built from mid-50s to low 60s. As some added context, the peak of my previous HM block culminated in a 70 mile week, and I averaged somewhere in the mid-60s for the 10 weeks leading up to the race.

In August, I finish my internship and built up to some 70 mile weeks, September was a little lackluster but still consistent with the start of the school year, and then started stacking bricks. October and November saw (in order) 78, 81, 80, 71, 80, 72 mile weeks. The Strava graph was admittedly a bit erratic, but was still consistent. My longest runstreak was about 6 weeks long.

Training was great. Coach had me do one midweek workout and one weekend long run. The two major themes of this block (as I think with all good marathon blocks) were: Long long runs, long intervals. CIM is a 'cheater course' but is still brutally honest- I live and train in Chicago, so coach was sure to include hill strides (over the local highway overpass. Yippee. Always inspiring) into the mix.

I deviated from Coach's plans very little, but didn't take a day off every week and ran some occasional doubles. 

I don't want to share everything I did (the secret sauce entirely credited to Coach), but my staple weekday workout was a 1 hour/10 mile tempo. Throughout the 15 week marathon-specific block, I repeated this workout 6 times. Every time, I got progressively faster, working down from doing this at 6:40 pace (albeit over rolling hills at altitude) and finishing at a 10 mile tempo in 61:00 (done on a treadmill with varying incline from 0 -> 2). We also did a couple broken tempos with hills placed in the middle. 

I did a lot of long long runs. I did 4 3 hour runs, some with pace-specific work, a couple long run fartleks (say 9 x mile with 4 minute jogging recovery) nestled into 2h30min runs. My peak workout was 4 x 30 minutes on November 16th, averaging 6:25-20/mi for the intervals nestled into a run of 3h at a pace of 6:34/mi. That was very difficult, but it gave me lots of confidence for the marathon. I can share more details about overdistance runs in the comments if people are interested.

My coach has a wonderful philosophy, but the overdistance runs (i.e. 3 hour runs) were brutally difficult to recover from- both mentally and physically. I hadn't been someone who runs with music often, but those 3 hour runs almost always required some company (from friends on bikes) or other people to run with. Otherwise I was just too zoned out. However, the marathon is a brutally difficult task in and of itself.

I came dangerously close to running the full marathon distance in a couple runs, but I always made sure to stop early. Something about saving my marathon virginity for the day of the race was special. 

### Pre-race

Carb loading. I love Trader Joe's- some orange juice, some bread, some more bread. Not a big pasta guy (although a customary pasta dinner was had beforehand).

Traveled to Sacramento Saturday morning, landing sometime in the early afternoon. A quick trip to the grocery store to pick up dinner provisions, and we checked in to the airbnb around 3PM. Was an otherwise stress-less night. Was lucky to have two supporters, some family members, and a dear friend also running the race. Having a large support crew is great- something I never realized. People around really helped with calming me down (I get really bad prerace anxiety unless I'm talking to someone)

Morning wakeup was around 4AM, focused on drinking some cold brew coffee (for a total of 300mg of caffeine) and bagels/bread. Decided that I was going to try to eat solid food until ~5:45AM.

Got to the shuttle bus at 5:30, chilled out at the start line (with a light warmup- maybe 10 mins of jogging) in the meantime. Ate a Maurten 160 before heading over to the corral. 

### Race

I don't really have much recollection of the race. Coach suggested to go through halfway in around 1:25, and I decided not to listen to him. Sorry. I wanted to run under 2:45, and realized that a 4-5 minute negative split was far too aggressive. I was set on going through halfway in 1:23:mid and working down from there. I tried not to go faster than 6:20/mi for the first half.

I did listen to his other piece of advice, where he said that the marathon is a 20 mile tempo and 10k race. I decided that I would hold things steady for 16-18 miles, and then try to make a move if the legs allowed it. 

One of my friends quoted Stephen Scullion's 'Just another Sunday' mantra, which I kept in mind during the first half of the race. I knew I needed to be having some amount of fun i the first half, as that true 'race concentration' mentality can only be held for so long for me.

Jumped around the pack for the first 10 miles, working my way between a couple groups and getting free pacesetting from some incredibly locked-in NAIA atheltes. Wanted to run with some other people, but everyone was struggling enough with the up/downhills to where a consistent pack didn't really have the chance to form. Or maybe I just didn't get into one. I am glad that I chose to run with people, as their footstrike provided a nice rhythm to mimic.

My shoelace came untied around 3 miles in, and I only found a right moment to tie it around the 8 mile mark once I actually felt something in my toes. I'm grateful to all the people who passed me- although I'm not happy that they passed me- for letting me know my shoes were undone. Clocked off the first 5K in 19:37. This was a bit fast, but the downhills were absolutely carrying me.

Things went will past the 6 mile mark (clocked 5-10K in 19:41) and I went through mile 7, but falling behind the group I was loosely running with absolutely sucked due to tying my shoe. However, I took it as a goal to get back up to them, and althoguh I ran a slightly below-speed mile 9 (just out of the rhythm of things, as well as a slight uphill) I clocked in and was determined to catch up to this group before 11 miles, which I did do.

Immediately after catching up to this group (and clocking 6:11/18) for mile 10 and 11, my shoe came untied again. I tied it sometime in the 12th (6:34 mile) and caught back up to the group immedaitely after by using some hills and running tangents well to my advantage. I realized that there was no way I was holding 6:10/mi for miles 11 onward, so I dialed things down a bit in order to make sure I had the ability to close.  

I passed through halfway in **1:23:39**. At the 13 mile mark, I realized that I was feeling incredibly strong, and decided that I was going to keep things steady until 15. Restraint was difficult but necessary. Around this time, I caught two guys who were running together incredibly well, and used them for pacesetting. I believe they were either friends or enemies, and were participating in the NAIA championships attached to CIM. 

I ran miles 16 and 17 slightly faster- 6:17 and 6:16 just to see if my legs were up for the task of taking things quicker. This was the 'test' that I planned on. The answer was yes. Mile 19 was clocked off in 6:15, and I decided that it was the approximately correct time to make a move.

Around mile 20 I saw one of my family members who was spectating, and she yelled 'race starts at mile 20!.' Around this point, there was also someone who started dropping some quicker miles, and I was determined not to let him get away. I went into this race wanting to make sure that I negative split hard and raced well. I think this race was only well-executed because of my determination to not let this person pass me.

I closed mile 20 in 6:08, following this pace-pusher. At some point I joked if this was the '2:45 train' and he shrugged. The fact that I was able to but out a sentence at mile 19 was a surprise to me. 21 came in at 6:09, 22 in 6:12, 23 in 6:07, 24 in 6:09, 25 in 6:02, and 26 in 5:58. I don't have any memory of what happened after mile 20 (except for some dude in a Jesus costume damning me to hell over an overpass) and some poor segments of road. I felt my blood pressure rising significantly during this, which was pretty funny. Overall, I was really happy catching people who were fading, or making a move on others who tried to pass me. 

I had very slight cramps in my right calf from mile 23 onwards. Whenever a spasm hit, I would just scream out and run faster, changing my footstrike oh-so-slightly for 20 or so seconds.

I kicked to the end and clocked in a *2:44:41* for my first marathon.

### Post-Race

Had a nice cry because I felt overwhelmed. Not prideful but definitely proud of myself for putting in the work. Had my first beer of a couple months with dinner. 

Hindsight is 20/20 and retrospect is valuable, but I was definitely confused about some of the workouts. My coach was able to explain the purpose of each of them- I spent a lot of time reading about how other coaches develop systems (i.e. I read a lot about Canova's principles, some stuff about how Sa*azar did stuff, as well as looking scientific research and talking to experienced friends) and started to understand a lot more about what makes a fast marathoner tick. I also learned the value of recovery from workouts- one can half-ass recovering from 6 miles of threshold, but not from 30K close to marathon pace. 

I'm not ready to be self-coached, but I have a much deeper understanding of what it means to recover from workouts, adapt to stimulus, and understand what effort-specific workouts give you.

I'm really proud of my race execution. Especially for a first time, I think my approach was calm and level-headed. My negative split was well-executed.

I do also want to recommend Second City Track Club for anyone who lives in Chicago. The group is excellent, the coach is responsive and incredibly encouraging. Although he has his quirks, the system he's developed works well for someone already used to training at a 'serious' level, and relies on you (as someone who runs for fun, and for the love of the process) to make the most of it.

Although I gave coach a hard time for assigning these long long runs- nobdoy else I knew was running 22 miles + on a consistent basis- I'm confident that these were critical to my ability to close the marathon hard. Not only was I physically prepared to run fast on pre-cramping legs, but I was psychologically zoned in to running for over 2.5 hours (which I hadn't really done beforehand). What I could not make up for in volume (i.e. running 100mpw, or consistently running 80+) was made up for in stimulus from the overdistance runs. I do not recommend them for everyone, but when done intermittently and properly (i.e. with every care of nutrition and recovery before/after) they aren't too bad.

CIM's weather profile also fit me. I do well in the cold (or at least I think weather impacts me more than it does most people). The slight mist, cold temperatures, and lack of wind were absolutely wonderful.

Legs were fully shot. Taking a week of no running.

Energy drinks didnt make me feel full, they would put me in a weird purgatory where im not full or hungry, which also applies when i AM full. So id eat more bc i didnt feel it. 

long and short, id rather not die early bc of a heart problem i gave myself from chronic energy drink/caffeine consumption on a body compromised by an eating disorder. it’s hard, but at least this gives me a fighting chance to make it beyond 30.

Once in a great while, it'd be perfect. But that's not nearly often enough for me.

Then, I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBj9ejasCiI) from Home Cafe by Charlie. Charlie explains how frothing is different depending upon a number of factors, but most importantly when it comes to the type of wand tip.  The Bambino Plus comes with a 4-hole tip.  I was floored when I realized how all the tipping, angling, swirling, etc., were completely unnecessary to get good foam from a Bambino Plus. You don't even need to use the auto mode and temp sensor.  *You just let it sit there*. That's right, the 4-hole tip is pure magic.

Few things to note:

* That's a 175ml ~~tea~~ cappuccino cup
* That's 75g of cold, whole (\~3%) milk in tiny 200ml frothing pitcher - perfect for one cappuccino. (Is that a bit heavy on the milk for a cappuccino?)
* I usually pour milk into the cup and stick in the freezer during the minutes I'm brewing the coffee. This provides more time to actually froth before the milk boils.
* No, I did not intentionally draw that Rorschach-style sheep's head with the white foam. Pure coincidence. The most I ever try to do in terms of latte-art is a nice circle. I just want to drink it.",2,1733882546.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Previously I had been using a little blade grinder for light roast Ethiopian, and it was inconsistent, but fruity and complex. With the Ode it's just been... okay. It tastes good but more beany- no floral or fruity notes. I've tried as fine as 5 and as course as 7 and it hasn't made a difference except to lean towards bitter or sour. When I've got it right, no fruity notes. I've only had it a week. Is there anything I can do to bring out the fruity notes more, or is that gone now with the use of this flat burr grinder? I am using just an electric coffee maker, but I was able to get nice flavor notes with the blade grinder, and I'd hate to think the Ode is going to produce a nice but meh Ethiopian.

I'll show both what you get for zero effort, and the maximum for earning 1300+ points.

For battery values, I'll be using drop rates from [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oeSKlAHYqFqHvwh866KElWFYK3ZaYH7rGIsLS_h18qg/edit?gid=1090183472#gid=1090183472). To keep things simple, I'm ignoring the battery value of the master copies.

It seems like every bingo card has 5 objectives which will automatically be completed simply by doing your dailies, arranged so that they also form two lines. These objectives are Login Streak, Video Store Management, Scratch-Off Lottery, drinking coffee, and Event Schedule (engagement points for daily errands). All together, this gives 800 points, enough to receive all the Polychrome rewards. If anyone has an example of a bingo card that earns fewer than 800 points from standard daily activities, please share a screenshot of it.

And so, here are the rewards:

Old Weekly Rewards (Weekly Custom Schedule) | Count | Amount | Amount/battery | Battery value
-|-|-|-|-
Inter-Knot Credit |  | 300 |  | 	
Disc EXP | 2 pink | 4000 | 595 | 6.72
Dennies |  | 7000 | 1250 | 5.6
 |  |  | | **12.32** | 

New Weekly Rewards (Ridu Weekly - 800 points) | Count | Amount | Amount/battery | Battery value
-|-|-|-|-
Inter-Knot Credit||600||
Agent EXP|4 pink|12000|561|21.39
W-Engine EXP|2 pink|6000|750|8
Master copies|2 red				
Dennies||0|1250|0

New Weekly Rewards (Ridu Weekly - full) | Count | Amount | Amount/battery | Battery value

Master copies|2 red			
Dennies||20000|1250|16
Inspiration||65		
Polychrome||**60**
 | | | |**45.39**

By doing nothing but claim the new weeklies that you finish via normal daily activities, you get an extra 17 battery worth of materials, as well as 60 Polychrome and 300 Inter-Knot Credit (plus 40 Inspiration, which was added with the update) compared to the old weeklies. You're missing out on the 7k Dennies and 4k Disc EXP, but gaining more than twice as much overall battery value.

Spending a few minutes to do additional objectives adds 20k Dennies (worth 16 battery), 450 Inter-Knot Credit, and 25 Inspiration.

And here's the value of Hoyolab monthly (selling the Bangboo EXP for 180 Dennies):

1hbin0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1hbin0n/m4f30_seeking_an_advancedliterate_writing_partner/,[M4F][30+] Seeking an Advanced/Literate Writing Partner for Long-Term Stories and Collaboration,"**Wow. So much has changed...**

Long story short, I got my start in roleplaying back during the golden age of AOL and Yahoo (anyone else remember the Red Dragon Inn back in the late 90s and early 2000s?). Ah, those were the days, right? When the biggest worry was your dial-up connection, haha.

As I'm sure you'd all agree—finding long-term, advanced/literate writers is much more challenging these days. I have fond memories of when the process of coming up with a plot was an organic process; where you'd genuinely take the time to get to know the other person, build rapport, and allow a plot to form naturally.

That's what I'm hoping to find. With that said, I put a lot of effort into this post, so hopefully there's someone else out there who values the same things in a writing partner!

**First of all, here's a bit about me as a person:**

* I'm 30+, male, and I've written several novels and a bunch of articles, mostly in historical fiction and contemporary stories. Writing isn't just my job; it's pretty much a part of who I am.
* I'm always trying to learn something new, whether it's from books, documentaries, or just good old chatting. History and cultures fascinate me the most.
* When I'm not buried in books or work, I love to hike and take photos. There’s something about being out in nature that just clears my head.
* I love to read (especially non-fiction and historical fiction). I'm always down for swapping book recommendations, if you're also a reader!
* I love peanut butter (crunchy over smooth any day – fight me).
* On that note, if I'm being honest, coffee isn't just a drink for me; it's a ritual!
* I'm a big fan of the simple things in life. Give me a sunset, a good laugh, or a perfect slice of pizza, and I’m set.
* I love diving into those deep, meandering conversations that start with ""what if"" and end somewhere between ""the meaning of life"" and ""why can’t we tickle ourselves?""
* Fun fact: I used to be able to recite all 50 states in alphabetical order — a party trick born out of a grade school challenge, haha.

**Here's what I'm looking for in a writer:**

* ***Writing Style -*** I'm looking for a partner who has a strong command of the English language. I'm talking about descriptive passages that paint clear pictures, dialogue that is crisp, concise, and not overly flowery. I prefer to write in the 3rd person, past tense. I prefer modern fiction and historical fiction stories.
* ***Communication -***  Life's unpredictable! What’s important is keeping each other in the loop about our schedules and any changes in the story or our approach. A quick heads-up can make a huge difference. It's all about being honest and direct with our feedback and thoughts.
* ***Long-Term Plots -*** I'm really looking for a writing partner who's in it for the long haul and is passionate about crafting intricate, plot-driven stories. For me, the joy of roleplaying lies in developing a story that evolves over time, with twists and turns that keep us both engaged and inspired.
* ***Sense of Humor -*** Writing together should be fun and relaxed, not just a serious crafting of narratives. It’s important to me that we can both throw in a bit of humor now and then, not only in our stories but in our interactions too.

And there you have it! If you're a detail-oriented, communicative, mature, and long-term story lover, you might just be the writing partner I'm looking for.

We should totally write such a good story that our keyboards will need a vacation after we're done, haha. I hope to hear from you!",1,1733882340.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

1. What type of margins do drop shippers typically look for?

1hbikh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDeprogram/comments/1hbikh5/read_theory_is_overstated_revolution_is_not_a/,"""Read Theory"" is overstated; Revolution is not a puzzle or mystery to study it is a War; we need more Revolutionary thugs, fewer theorists!","I've been seeing Leftists online write ""educate yourself"" for 20 years and what has it accomplished? A few Red-themed coffee shops near expensive Universities is about it, as far as I can tell. I think the online reply-guys that post ""read theory"" smugly underestimate normal people's intelligence. Most people know they're getting screwed they just don't see realistic ways out. I intuitively understood, even as a boy who never saw any political media more sophisticated than ""the Nazis were evil but pretty cool"" programs the History Channel constantly aired, I instinctively knew anyone I worked for would never pay me a penny more than they needed to because they'd rather keep the money. The Libertarian Randian nonsense (I should just be the boss, I'd be better at it!) I ended up fantasizing about was a completely unrealistic solution to that problem but no more unrealistic than a Communist Revolution in America is. 

When faced with overwhelming enemies normal people don't rise against them, they capitulate or try to join them. Normal people aren't willing to suffer now, especially not physical pain, unless they have a strong belief that suffering will result in major gains in the future.

Sad to say but right now a Communist Revolution is just about the least likely way normal Americans are going to see their life improved, no matter how much theory they read and how much they tell their friends to read. A Revolution is never going to seem like a more realistic option than what the reactionaries offer, like Crypto-scams, OnlyFans primping, or the old-fashioned Lumpen marketplaces of illicit drugs and sex. This of course refers to Americans well-off to pursue money in such degenerative markets; those who are so beaten down and destitute that a Communist Revolution is really their best hope are usually too debilitated to meaningfully contribute to a Revolution. 

What I think is more realistic than a Leftist American Revolution is a prolonged campaign of decentralized guerilla warfare. Such a campaign would show both the masses and the Capitalists that the Ruling Class, their assets and their hirelings are not unassailable. Wouldn't that make Leftist politics look bad? The Capitalists will do that anyway? Wouldn't that cause a bolstering of the Police State? The Capitalists will do that anyway. Wouldn't that cause the Capitalists' puppet politicians to strip civilian access to guns and munitions? Probably not since that market is too lucrative for the profiteers to deny, and Leftist direct action would cause gun sales to skyrocket. 

Where does a movement get the manpower necessary for guerilla warfare, one of the most manpower intensive campaigns there is; manpower not only in sheer numbers of workers required, but the physical labors involved? The Fascists have long had an answer for their military manpower needs and that is, angry, unfulfilled, young men. Unfortunately for the Left this is a demographic that doesn't especially enjoy ""read theory"" or ""educate yourself"". The Fascist solution has often just been making up whatever ideological bullshit gets them marching in the desired direction. Leftists are far too concerned with materialism as an *ideology* when it comes to Revolution, imo. Revolution is a War and war requires masses of obedient soldiers and, a vastly smaller number of, strategic officers. Practically speaking it doesn't necessarily matter what the soldiers believe as long as they're able and willing to fight. In a true Revolution vast numbers of comrades would be imprisoned or killed and would need to be replaced, not an easy task if every soldier must be thoroughly-educated in Dialectical Materialism before he picks up a weapon. Two of the most ingenious tools of Maoism were the Little Red Books and Struggle Sessions as these are much more efficient methods of motivating the masses towards Revolution than the individualist brain rot of telling people to read and learn theory of their own personal volition.

Leftists must find a way of motivating men to violence as effectively as the Fascists do. Honestly I'm unsure why the Fascists are so much more effective at this. Most of the Fascist rhetoric that incites violence is a basic variant of, ""these useless people want to steal what's yours."" It seems like Leftists should have an advantage because, in our case, that premise is actually true! My current hypothesis is that Fascist propaganda is directed at men who are already inclined to violence more-so than Leftist Agitprop is. Fascist's dominance in ""Gamer culture"" let's them get their violent incitement in front of the eyes of countless disenfranchised Lumpen young men who have frequent fantasies of violent dominance. Leftists aren't nearly as effective at getting any message to that audience. This method and audience isn't conducive to organized struggles but it at least puts knowledge and fear of the Fascists into the public when they push an incel to gun down minorities. Leftists are treated like a joke in America because no one is afraid of them. The CEO shooter got radical Leftist politics more respect than its ever had in my lifetime just because people thought the killer *might* have been motivated by such politics. 

All the reading theory someone can do won't amount to much in a Revolution if he doesn't have the personal inclination to get his hands dirty, break-in some doors, set some fires, etc. This was another genius aspect of the Struggle Sessions as they encouraged ordinary people to do real interpersonal violence to the pigs rather than delegating that to some official duty carried out by a professional. The material gains of a Communist Revolution would not be realized by most Americans for many years, maybe decades, and without the promise of immediate material gain what's left for the Left is inspiring hatred for the parasites and equipping people to act on that hatred. 

Friend or foe, I can learn from anyone. I'm not quick to scoff at any political ideology except the online meme ones which have never existed in any significant capacity historically. That it controlled a civilization for a historically significant amount of time is self-evident proof imo that there were some effective aspects of every historical political system. Fascism is nonsense but ideological coherence and truth aren't necessarily advantages in winning wars. That Fascism promotes effective ways of motivating direct action against opposition is an advantage in my book. I'll admit I haven't studied historical Fascists in a more than cursory way but I doubt the Hitler Youth engaged in what we'd consider ""reading theory"" or that Yukio Mishima wanted to restore the status of the Japanese Emperor because he had a academically-rigorous theory for doing so. The magical thinking encouraged by Fascism and Religion is false but many ideologies are blatantly false and still have real power grow from them. If its stupid but it works its not stupid. The ""read theory"" guys could benefit from accepting that ugly but pragmatic wisdom.",0,1733882123.0,TheDeprogram,12,0.22,False

1hbihtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hbihtp/i_saw_my_face_on_a_billboard/,I saw my face on a billboard,"Julia watched the stream of coffee fall into the officer's cup, wondering if what he had just said was nothing more than a bad joke. Unable to react, an odd coldness growing inside her, she crossed her arms to warm up, but all she felt were the patches of cold, dried blood on her shirt. The only sound breaking the silence in the police station was the coffee machine, lasting only a few brief seconds. Indifferent now to the inquisitive gazes of the men standing beside her, Julia waited for Officer Fuentes to speak again, even though she knew she would have preferred to watch that thread of coffee fall forever.  
  
""So, do you want to explain yourself?""  
  
There was nothing to explain. She knew that no matter how hard she tried, nothing would sound reasonable to anyone else's ears except her own. Still, without wanting to, her mouth began to move and a strangely fragile, unfamiliar voice started to speak.  
  
""I met him by the river, on the outskirts...""  
  
It was the Santos River, a winding line that divided the more than 2,000 kilometers of forest surrounding the eponymous town. She had never passed through that area, nor had she been interested in seeing a river she had only heard typical things about, before that warm Friday afternoon, at the end of another school year. Despite being the target of insults and mistreatment from her classmates throughout the year, nothing had prepared her for what they had planned for her that day. They were going to make sure that people like her never set foot in the school again.  
  
A group of students, with the teacher’s permission, had gotten the keys to the classroom and locked the doors before Julia could leave. What followed could only be remembered as a series of fleeting images and sensations that her mind had preferred to bury. Thousands of hands holding her down. Markers piercing her skin. Scissors cutting her clothes. By some miracle, she had managed to escape that hell and jumped through the window before her captors could catch her.  
  
She ran through several unfamiliar streets, pushing her way through a crowd of people shouting curses and attempting to land a few punches. Despite this, she reached the forest and, finding no other option, decided to take refuge there, both from the scolding she would receive from her father and from the gangs that came out at dusk.  
  
At one point, she had reached the Santo River, drawn by its murmur, and fell into a deep sleep.  
Later that night, she was awoken by the sound of a voice. When she opened her eyes, Julia saw the figure of a thin, ragged boy beside her. He tried to approach her, adjusting his square glasses, to which Julia threatened to throw a stone. She asked who he was and what he wanted. The boy, silent as a stone, did not respond. It wasn't until Julia let go of the stone that he spoke, if that tiny, brief voice could even be called speech. He told her his name was Boris, that he enjoyed spending time there by the river and visiting the abandoned cabin nearby, which he preferred over his parents’ house.   
  
He asked Julia why she had come there and why she was in such a state. She, in tears, told him what had happened, how she hated being different from the others and being unable to do anything about it. She had promised herself she would leave the town and go to the city one of these days. Boris, meanwhile, just comforted her. Noticing the night sky, Julia realized that any possibility of returning home before her father’s police shift ended was lost.   
  
She had heard that the gangs that came out at that hour targeted people like her and made them disappear. She didn't remember ever having met one, aside from her mother, and since she had died, she had lost hope of ever meeting one again. Despite this, Boris, who had heard the stories as well, offered to help her.  
  
After bringing a blanket and a bat from the cabin, he covered Julia, moved by the gesture, and together they left the forest and made their way back to town. Fortunately, that night, Julia managed to get home in time.  
  
In the following days, Julia took every opportunity she had to go to the river. For the first time in her life, she had made a friend, a real one. Since she could remember, the only person she had been able to talk to without fear of being judged was her father, though she still remembered the countless times in the market or park when he had made an effort to distance himself from her while interacting with others. With Boris, it was different. In those first days, they could talk about anything for hours and hours, though she always led the conversation, with their feet submerged in the cold river water, with nothing but the arrival of night interrupting them.   
  
By the river, she couldn’t be hurt; she was safe from the gazes, words, and hands. Eventually, deep things, repressed emotions, became routine. At least for Julia; for Boris, it was easy to listen, but he never talked more than about his breakfast that day or his rock collection. Moreover, he seemed to not enjoy much physical contact. Every time Julia tried to get closer, he would pull away, and he didn’t respond well to friendly punches or even greetings. Still, there was one thing they both agreed on.   
  
After the incident at school, Julia held onto her decision to leave the town, and together with Boris, she started saving money for what would be the most important day of her life. Every day, without fail, they would put a coin in a jar that Boris used to collect stones. At first, they were content with tips from their parents or coins they found under furniture, but it didn’t take long for them to realize that they would need more than that to reach their goal.   
  
The first coin Julia stole from her father was from his desk, the change from some insignificant purchase. She felt that being the daughter of a police officer somehow gave her a certain freedom to do some things, and what began as a couple of coins quickly turned into bills. She never knew how Boris got his share, but at that moment, it only mattered that he did.  
  
One morning, Julia found Boris walking along the riverbank, muttering things to himself. With a strange excitement, he told her that he had an idea that would solve all their problems. He spoke of Libertad Street, on the other side of town, where there was the only gas station they had. The owners would leave their son in charge that night, a boy who was not all that bright. They would take advantage of the opportunity to empty the cash register and leave the next day.   
  
It didn’t take much to convince Julia. And so, at dusk, they followed Boris’s plan to the letter. They arrived at Libertad, both wearing caps to cover their faces, carrying a trash bag. The deplorable state of that part of town was evident. Julia noticed the piles of trash, the burnt poles, and the thousands of papers stuck to every inch of walls and doors, faded by time, with a few illegible words in red being the only thing distinguishable. Thick letters that spelled a curse to the image of something wicked, now practically invisible. Seeing all this only made them hurry. They entered the gas station, distracted the poor boy in charge without much difficulty, and in less than five minutes, left the place with a bag of bills. Julia hid them under her bed at home, waiting for the right moment to use them.  
  
However, the right moment wouldn't come soon. When Julia was ready to leave, Boris wasn't, and when Boris was ready, Julia no longer was. A week passed like this, postponing her departure for the smallest reasons just to savor one more day of the comfort of routine. Meanwhile, the tickets continued to wrinkle under Julia's bed.

One sunny morning, while cleaning one of her windows, Julia noticed a figure lurking behind the tree in her garden. She told Boris about it during one of their daily meetings. She could tell it worried him by the quick change in his expression and what he said. He told her he had suspected something was off with that gas station, but hadn't believed it was true.   
  
He had heard that one of the most dangerous gangs in town, The Blue Brothers, had been seen on Libertad Street. It was likely they'd already taken over the gas station and were looking for the culprits behind the robbery. Boris urged Julia to close all the curtains and leave for the city as soon as possible. Understanding the danger she was in, Julia knew her repeated delays had to end. She'd go home and pack her things once and for all. Before leaving, she told Boris she would see him the next day at the same place to coordinate their trip together. He gave a small smile and simply said yes.

The first thing she did was close the curtains. She spent the whole night packing every piece of clothing, book, and ticket she had, hiding her only suitcase under the bed. When she finished, she intended to sleep, but then she heard someone knock at the front door. Cautiously, feeling a chill run through her body, she went to check. In the living room, her father slept in his armchair, with the TV on, showing a news program filled with shouting. Julia found a note at the bottom of the door. ""WE FOUND YOU."" She couldn't sleep the rest of the night.

The next day, Boris reviewed the message, which only confirmed his suspicions. He asked Julia if she was ready to leave, if she knew the way, and how to survive outside. She said yes. She felt ready, but that feeling only terrified her. The rest of the day, they avoided talking about the subject, instead laughing and discussing the city and what awaited them. Julia thought about the ice creams, all the flavors. She would never have to be kicked out of ice cream shops again or only taste the ice creams thrown at her, falling to the ground. Boris listened to her all afternoon without saying a word. He nodded, smiled, and rubbed his hands. As evening fell, Julia asked Boris to walk her home before saying goodbye, but he had to refuse. He needed to return home soon that time.

Walking quickly through the streets of Santo, Julia couldn't remember feeling so vulnerable since the incident at school. The blurry papers on the walls and the burned debris from darker times never made her feel so sick. She managed to read one of the papaers. The word FUCK had never been so clearer. Another one wasn't so different. LICE. Then another one. SHIT. KILL. DEAD. She turned onto the street that led to her house and spotted a familiar figure in the distance. When she realized who it was, her body froze. Behind that figure, three others came into view, and together, they began running towards her. Julia turned around and saw three more figures approaching.   
  
Surrounded by the group, Julia braced for the worst. The first person she saw was the first to approach. He was a young, thin guy, wearing a leather jacket and a blue bandana tied around his left arm. In a quick movement, he grabbed her by the hair with one hand, and they all started laughing. After shouting some horrible words Julia preferred not to remember, he threw her to the ground and began kicking her repeatedly all over her body, amidst a wave of insults and mockery.   
  
On the ground, trembling from the pain, she looked up, and a flash of light blinded her before she lost consciousness. She spent three days in bed recovering from her injuries. Her father had found her bleeding on the ground, in the rain. It caused him great pain to see her in that state, but he chose to keep the incident a secret. He brought her food to bed and checked on her constantly, and Julia, feeling the suitcase on her back, couldn't look him in the eye or speak to him.

On the fourth day, a Friday morning, Julia took her suitcase and left the house without waking her father. She planned to spend the whole day by the river, waiting for Boris to arrive. She heard him approach after a few hours. Seeing her injuries, Boris, perplexed, came over to check on her but didn't touch her. He bombarded her with questions that Julia didn't bother answering. She just assured him that she was fine, that it had been an accident. She hadn't come just to inspire sympathy.   
  
She showed him the suitcase and the tickets inside. It was time to leave. She had nothing else to do there, and he clearly wasn't busy with how early he'd arrived. They wouldn't have a better opportunity than that. Julia asked him where his bags were. It didn't matter; she'd wait there until he brought them. Despite her excitement, Julia gradually noticed that Boris, as silent as ever, didn't share her enthusiasm. Defeated, she asked him one last question. ""You will come, right?"" The silence that followed only confirmed what she feared. With tears in her eyes, she repeated the question over and over, trying to grab Boris's shirt, but he pushed her hands away. At one point, Julia grabbed his shirt so forcefully that he gave up, and she, as close to him as she had ever been, kissed him on the lips. Boris jerked away from her and, with eyes filled with rage, spat on the grass before running toward the trees.

It wasn't unusual to find the streets near the main road empty at the time Julia arrived, but that day, they looked like something out of a ghost town. Walking leisurely, replaying the conversation in the woods in her head, she realized she had reached the intersection of the main street with Libertad Street, the gas station illuminating the horizon like a giant lamp. Guided by a morbid curiosity, she turned onto that street, thinking she would reach the road through the gas station.   
  
Under its lights, she glanced at the elderly receptionist couple in the shop and walked toward the road. However, the silhouette of a man sitting by the shop's door stopped her. He was just a drunk, finishing the last drops of his bottle. But when his arm entered the light, and she noticed the blue bandana tied to it, a bitter sensation grew in her mouth, and she couldn't bear to keep watching any longer. The papers, naturally, were everywhere, and she could easily cath the words from the corner of her eye. FUCK. She dropped her suitcase on the sidewalk and walked towards the man, not taking her eyes off him. DAMN. She grabbed his shirt and lifted him with all her strength to see his face. It was him. The same guy who had beaten her senseless. KILL. KILL. KILL. She dragged him several meters into the darkness and began kicking him in the stomach, not holding back. He barely tried to defend himself with his bottle. Julia took it from his hands, smashed it on the ground, and drove it into the guy's stomach, making him groan in intense pain. Without pausing to think, in a state of irrationality, Julia stabbed him with the bottle so many times that sprays of blood splattered all over his white shirt. Even at the gas station, the guy's and Julia's gut-wrenching screams could be heard. Someone called the police, and within minutes, they ended that bloody scene.

“… and you brought me here. That’s it.”  
  
Officer Fuentes takes the last sip of his coffee and lets out a small laugh. He glances at the body in the next room without saying a word. Tired of the officer's silence, Julia demands an answer.  
“That’s why I’m asking you to tell me the man’s name. The real name.”  
“I’ve already told you. That man over there is Boris Durán.”  
  
Julia can’t help but laugh. She knows that Boris is with his family, probably regretting what he did in the forest. The officer begins to explain the details, trying to reason with her. He tells her about his criminal background, his connections, his modus operandi, and how he managed to deceive her for so long. But Julia doesn’t listen. She thinks of Boris, regretting what he did in the forest, crying in his bed like a baby. He always was a baby. The way he spoke so slowly. His aversion to touching others. His thin frame, tangled hair, sad eyes, those giant glasses that made him look stupid. Those stupid glasses. The glasses that blinded him when they reflected the sun.  
  
Officer Fuentes orders that she be taken to the police truck. A case like this had no place in a court like the one in the village of Santos. They would try her in the city. They would televise it, turn the whole process into a horrendous spectacle, but the law would be carried out. She could trust the city for that. Before leaving, he turned to Julia’s father, standing beside her.  
  
“She’s your daughter, right?”  
  
“Unfortunately, yes, sir.”  
  
On the road, Julia thought about everything Boris was missing. Things hadn’t gone according to plan, but at least she was on her way to the city. She would see the buildings, as tall as the sky; the cars, floating down the streets; and, most importantly, the ice cream shops. She couldn’t stop imagining the flavors, endless, but equally delicious. She only worried they wouldn’t let her visit the ice cream shops. She had to find a way to get there. Would there be ice cream at the courthouse?  
  
Peering through the grilles that separated her from the driver, Julia got her first glimpse of the city. It was unlike anything she had imagined before. The buildings were taller, and the cars, faster. The police truck entered a highway that seemed to have no end, where thousands of cars and people moved in perfect harmony. Julia observed, from inside this metropolis, the concrete and metal miracle in all its splendor. But something in particular caught her attention. Attached to the buildings, hanging from the bridges, and even projected into the air, thousands of billboards decorated the landscape. And on each one, differente faces, yet, in an way, the same one, appeared, accompanied by symbols and words Julia couldn’t read or simply didn't bother to anymore, bold words in a deep red, words that only inspired death.

","Take a trip back, to a different era, with me, the Archivist + at the South Pasadena Preservation Foundation and Historical Museum, as your guide as we look at a wealthy family wintering in Southern California as well as the menus they could’ve selected from!

It is January 4th, 1892 and you are a well-to-do New Englander wintering here in Southern California. You've rented a suite of rooms for you and your family to enjoy, the same ones you did every year. They wrap around a corner towards the back of the hotel on the 3rd floor, giving expansive views of the arroyo to the west, the few buildings (including a small general store) of South Pasadena to the south-west, and of course the magnificent San Gabriel mountains and Pasadena to the north.  

It has been a lovely time so far. You and your partner just returned from a post rose parade excursion on Mr. Lowe's fantastic mountain paradise, while your son has been simply enjoying the grounds and playing billiards, you brush off rumors that your ""adventurous"" daughter was possibly seen playing cards in disguise in one of the saloons in the old part of the Los Angeles Pueblo, as you know it to be true yet there is a part of you that is secretly proud of her spirit and her willingness to break from tradition.  

Tonight all are having dinner together at the Raymond, with all dressed in only the finest of clothing. Prior to dinner, the men gather in the Gents Billards room while the ladies relax in the Ladies Grand Parlour, hobnobbing with the biggest names of the day. Soon though you are escorted to your table in the 95 ft long, 19 ft tall Grand Dining Room, it is a place to behold. You will be served on fine china from the east by only the Crème de la crème of hotel staff, recruited from hotels in the east which are forced to close during winter. Your server comes by and asks what they could start you off with.

You order a Kickerboxer for yourself, your partner a Champagne Cobbler (made of course with the freshest of oranges), your daughter an Absinthe Cocktail (with a little mischievous look in her eye), and your son decides to go with the bartenders special, a Californian Sherry Wine Cobbler with the pineapple syrup replaced with a orange syrup. Now these drinks would be illegal and against local codes around here in the Pasadena area, however an exception was made for the grandest of hotels, the Raymond.

As you make idle chat with your family and others around you, you look through the menu, knowing that, like every night, only the best of the best would be coming out of that kitchen. With laugher and cheers glasses bang as dinner commences, followed by dancing in the Grand Ballroom when you've had your fill of Consomme, Boiled Yellow Tail, Ribs of Beef, Veal with Brown Sauce, Lamb with Mint Sauce, Mashed Potatoes, Stewed Beats, and a whole dessert selection including Cherry Sherbet, Apple Pie, Lemon Ice Cream, Cakes of all sorts, and of course locally sourced oranges. Nothing is better than this very moment, as you sit with a heart of family joy, a mouth of delicious flavors, and eyes filled with wander. 

This right here, is what wintering at the Raymond Hotel in South Pasadena in 1892 is all about.

1hbiec3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1hbiec3/m4f30_seeking_an_advancedliterate_writing_partner/,[M4F][30+] Seeking an Advanced/Literate Writing Partner for Long-Term Stories and Collaboration,"**Wow. So much has changed...**

Long story short, I got my start in roleplaying back during the golden age of AOL and Yahoo (anyone else remember the Red Dragon Inn back in the late 90s and early 2000s?). Ah, those were the days, right? When the biggest worry was your dial-up connection, haha.

As I'm sure you'd all agree—finding long-term, advanced/literate writers is much more challenging these days. I have fond memories of when the process of coming up with a plot was an organic process; where you'd genuinely take the time to get to know the other person, build rapport, and allow a plot to form naturally.

That's what I'm hoping to find. With that said, I put a lot of effort into this post, so hopefully there's someone else out there who values the same things in a writing partner!

**First of all, here's a bit about me as a person:**

* I'm 30+, male, and I've written several novels and a bunch of articles, mostly in historical fiction and contemporary stories. Writing isn't just my job; it's pretty much a part of who I am.
* I'm always trying to learn something new, whether it's from books, documentaries, or just good old chatting. History and cultures fascinate me the most.
* When I'm not buried in books or work, I love to hike and take photos. There’s something about being out in nature that just clears my head.
* I love to read (especially non-fiction and historical fiction). I'm always down for swapping book recommendations, if you're also a reader!
* I love peanut butter (crunchy over smooth any day – fight me).
* On that note, if I'm being honest, coffee isn't just a drink for me; it's a ritual!
* I'm a big fan of the simple things in life. Give me a sunset, a good laugh, or a perfect slice of pizza, and I’m set.
* I love diving into those deep, meandering conversations that start with ""what if"" and end somewhere between ""the meaning of life"" and ""why can’t we tickle ourselves?""
* Fun fact: I used to be able to recite all 50 states in alphabetical order — a party trick born out of a grade school challenge, haha.

**Here's what I'm looking for in a writer:**

* ***Writing Style -*** I'm looking for a partner who has a strong command of the English language. I'm talking about descriptive passages that paint clear pictures, dialogue that is crisp, concise, and not overly flowery. I prefer to write in the 3rd person, past tense. I prefer modern fiction and historical fiction stories.
* ***Communication -***  Life's unpredictable! What’s important is keeping each other in the loop about our schedules and any changes in the story or our approach. A quick heads-up can make a huge difference. It's all about being honest and direct with our feedback and thoughts.
* ***Long-Term Plots -*** I'm really looking for a writing partner who's in it for the long haul and is passionate about crafting intricate, plot-driven stories. For me, the joy of roleplaying lies in developing a story that evolves over time, with twists and turns that keep us both engaged and inspired.
* ***Sense of Humor -*** Writing together should be fun and relaxed, not just a serious crafting of narratives. It’s important to me that we can both throw in a bit of humor now and then, not only in our stories but in our interactions too.

And there you have it! If you're a detail-oriented, communicative, mature, and long-term story lover, you might just be the writing partner I'm looking for.

We should totally write such a good story that our keyboards will need a vacation after we're done, haha. I hope to hear from you!",1,1733881600.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

I have been passively skimming over uscoffeechampionship.org for details when I need a 5 or 10 minute break from studying for my finals, although some of the links seem to be dead. It appears that I can just sign up when registration is open for 2026.


I’m wondering the in between though. Like, specific tools or tech to track and log the info during the shot pulling? There is the supplies and equipment; that is taken care of because I opened up a stand at a farmers market this year, and I did WAY better than expected and absolutely did not think I’d have that kind of capability. I’ve done my practice and homework to making great espresso, but I didn’t think I’d get the praise I’d receive, several times I was told that to get something as good as my espresso they would have to go overseas, but I thought they were just being nice since it was my 1st market ever. What really convinced me was serving someone who was/is a SCA member said “I need to compete” and informed me of the website and competition. I had no idea about it, I thought competitions were a more local thing. I’m very thankful for those compliments but I was just making sure people weren’t served bad espresso. I used to work at the USPS, my mail route was a 15 mile daily hike for almost 8 years; I was treating everyone like they just walked 16 miles to my espresso stand.


If this info helps, I’ve used a variety of different roast brands, but look for growing elevations of at least 3,500 ft. I use an ACS Vostok to make my beverages (highly recommend using), I have read extensively into flavor theory and profiling to craft signature drinks, was in hospitality since I was 14, switched to the USPS in 2014 . All organic ingredients (NO UPCHARGE FOR OAT MILK or other non dairy! Starbucks bit on my idea 🤣). The beans I use are not served if they are past 50 days. IMO, they taste flat around that time. Even when I figured out wholesale ordering, the longest time from roast to served was 33 days at 25 pounds a shipment.

Normal. Very boring and very normal. 😁

Well...it did kinda suck for the first part of the whole appointment, but even that wasn't horrible. I had to have an IV put in for the contrast, but the lady missed twice (right arm then left arm) and ended up trying a 3rd time with the smallest bore needle they have...that has never happened. I said I could be dehydrated a bit (it is possible!) and apologized for that. She finally got the needle in the right arm and had me put my arms up over my head. Ok ..deep breath in...hold it...ok breathe. Twice. It was fine lol. The contrast actually felt...really good?? I mean the warmth from it, of course. It made me feel so nice and warm from the inside out...my face got hot and so did my...bottom half, if you know what I mean. It wasn't unpleasant this time tho. It was all just fine, just as I thought it would be.

Now, I wait. Sigh. 😁

I am exhausted from being out all day. My eldest had come in for a visit and was able to be there for my scan...it was nice to have support...and a ride. I didn't have to Uber there and back, and that was a nice treat.  We also went to the pet store and got a new parakeet since our other male 'keet died a week ago. I wasn't in a hurry to get another one, but I had the opportunity and I couldn't resist. It's too young to tell if it's a male or female but it is almost pure white with just a touch of blue on its chest. I named it Marshmallow bc that's what it looks like lol. 

Here's the funny part (I hope this makes you all smile!)--whem the employee was trying to catch the bird to put it in the box for me, the bird actually flew right into the net lol! The employee came out and was like ""it flew right in lol!"" I had just said before this that some birds are easy to catch and some are a pain (I've had many parakeets over the years) so that was absolutely perfect comedic timing that the bird flew into the net! Or maybe I had perfect comedic timing lol. Anyhow, it's really cute and I'm happy. Now my other female 'keet had a playmate again so she will stop harassing my poor cockatiel Coffee lol! Coffee can not stand the parakeets, and it used to be that Queenie, the female, hated Coffee just as much. After Smokey (the male) died last week, Queenie wouldn't leave Coffee alone. Poor thing was scared and lonely so I got her a mate (or a friend).

That is my update. Does anyone else feel very very tired after getting contrast dye? I didn't have a reaction at all (allergic)  but I am so drained now. My appetite is horrible again too. It had picked up yesterday a little bit and I had eaten more cals than I usually do. I was OK with that though bc it felt pretty good to have a bit more energy. Today...has been absolutely horrendous eating-wise. I dunno what happened.

I’m currently working to get a bachelors in biology and I’m a part of a research lab at my university with the hopes of going all the way for a PhD.

As for my interests, I’m very into biology (hence why it’s my major) and really all things nature, astronomy, physics; basically any science. I’m your typical nerdy guy into all the things you can think of when it comes to games on PC, Xbox, and Switch (league, valorant, zombies, resident evil, new vegas, cyberpunk, pokemon) movies (no country for old men, Tarantino films, any horror movie, LOTR, Star Wars) tv shows and reality tv (arcane, sopranos, HOTD, Futurama, ghost adventures, impractical jokers) as well as stuff on YouTube like caseoh, markiplier, stimpee, oneyplays. Oh I also like anime but haven’t been watching it much lately! I’m also pretty into sports baseball is my number one but I also like football, hockey, rugby, UFC and boxing. Also my sense of humor is pretty bad and can be edgy at times.

Last bit of info— im a pretty avid coffee drinker and I enjoy a beer here and there. No drugs but I am 420 friendly! I have a soft spots for cats and have two of my own they’re my everything. My favorite kinds of music are alternative, pop punk, indie, rock, and some metal.

I’m 24M and recently matched with a girl 24F who I was instantly attracted to on hinge. I’ve been using dating apps for a while now and have been on a few dates (hooked up with 2) and just met a few over coffee, but this one felt different because I seemed to be very physically attracted to her. We started talking and then I got her number and we were texting for some time and met 2 weeks after for our first date which I thought went really well because we spent around 4 hours together. We would talk a lot about qualities and values we’d find in a partner and etc etc, never really asked her directly what she’s looking for but the vibe she gave was that she wants something serious and just by seeing her and speaking to her I was willing to get serious with her.

After our date before leaving she mentioned she’s going to let me know about a 2nd date and that she needs time to let these things sit and process which I found odd. She went home that night and texted me thank you and texted a little more until she said goodnight. I decided not to say anything until she reached back with a clear decisive answer on if she wants to continue with moving things forward with another date and etc but after an entire day goes by she messages me asking hey how’s it going and when I responded she sounded off on how she felt upset and it rubbed her the wrong way that I didn’t say anything for a full day when even though I expressed interest in seeing her and that her speaking as usual would indicate continued interest. Stupid me, I took this as a hint that she’s pretty into me and we kept talking for another week on text and call and even scheduled a 2nd date and she would open up a lot about personal issues going on in her life and etc until she went on a girls trip a couple hours to another city. During the weekend and on this trip she was texting perfectly fine as she always does. Then out of the blue on Monday morning she sent me a message saying she realizes her feelings for me haven’t developed at this stage as she’d hope and that she hopes I can follow through with my other plans on the day we were going to meet again and that I didn’t do anything wrong in particular but that she’s firm on this decision. I told her I wish her the best and left it at that and we haven’t talked since. Now there are a couple details I’m leaving out of this due to anonymity and relevance but would love to get an idea from y’all on whether if I did something wrong or what could cause this abrupt end. I’ve spoken to friends and family about this and have seen other posts on Reddit where this is fairly common but thought I’d put my own experience on here since it’s a bit unique and get people’s perspective on it. It’s honestly been pretty heartbreaking as I thought it was worth emotionally investing into since we had a lot of similarities such as cultural, ethnic and values wise and all but I don’t know.",3,1733880218.0,AskMenAdvice,7,1.0,False

He knows a few people there.    They should have given him a cup of coffee and sent him back to the farm.

Instead, they decide this accidental trespasser is the best qualified person to lead a crewed spacecraft through a wormhole to save humanity.

If Cooper had not stumbled upon the NASA facility, was there no other person available to lead that mission?   NASA seems to have been rather unprepared to conduct the crewed mission if they just assign the mission to a random trespassing farmer who knows how to fly airplanes.

I’ve been lurking here for a while, and I’m really inspired by the progress I’ve seen from so many of you. I’m a 40-something male, 330 lbs, 5’9”. I used to be super athletic, but after an injury and life happening, my weight has gone up like crazy over the years.

A few days ago, I decided to give fasting a try, and somehow, I’ve made it to 70 hours on tea, coffee, and water (no sugar). Honestly, I feel amazing—high energy, clear-headed, and no real hunger yet.

Since this wasn’t planned and it’s my first real fast, I’d love some advice:

Should I keep going? How long is too long for a first fast
What should I eat or drink when I break it?
Any other tips to avoid rookie mistakes?

\- 2 cups flour  
\- 1/2 cup each of citron, milk, orange marmalade  
\- 4 eggs  
\- 1 teaspoon baking powder  
\- 2 teaspoons each of salt, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon

Mix all in a big bowl, stuff into the pudding tin (or can or bowl, whatever), cover with parchment/foil, tie it up good, and steam for 3 1/2 hours. Serve with basic hard sauce (stick of butter, 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar, a little orange juice or you can make it with rum or brandy I'm sure, we just never did)

For reference I am 22 years old, 3 years ago while smoking weed I started feeling my heart and started encountering what I today know is SVT. Until 2 weeks ago I thought it was solely my paranoia that caused me to stress and enter a positive feedback loop that increases my heart rate. However, less than 10 days ago , while studying I drank a cup of coffee (which is something I literally do everyday) and suddenly felt nauseous, fatigued then felt a rapid heartbeat and my hands were numb and so on until I went to the ER and there my Blood Pressure was 190/110 and heart rate ~180s and the Dr said it is what I have described above.
Went to 2 other doctors and they prescribed a beta blocker and said that I maybe should do a Catheter Ablation, however that is if it started to come frequently while taking the medication, which I started taking today during the episode.
Today I was working out (and btw I usually work out 3-5 days/week weightlifting etc and some cardio) and suddenly i felt nauseous and long story short it led to SVT. Lasted few hours and now it’s good.

My questions are as follows: 
1) is it normal for someone my age to have this triggered out of the blue? And while I understand it can be triggered to weed, i dont understand why it suddenly decided to get triggered from coffee, and now potentially too working out.
2) should i do the operation or not? And if so will everything come back to normal or what should I expect?",1,1733879340.0,askCardiology,1,0.66,False

I hope you’re all doing well. I’m an international student who moved to Auckland about six months ago. While I’ve been trying to adjust to life here, I’ve been finding it really hard to make meaningful connections or build a circle of friends.

Back home, it felt so much easier to meet people and form friendships. But here, between studies, part-time work, and adapting to a new environment, I’ve been struggling to put myself out there. I’ve met a few people, but it hasn’t really clicked, and I often find myself spending most of my free time alone.

I’m wondering if anyone else has felt this way or has any advice? Are there any groups, events, or places in Auckland where it’s easier to meet like-minded people? I’m open to trying anything, whether it’s casual meetups, hobby-based groups, or even just grabbing a coffee with someone.

Thanks for reading, and I’d really appreciate any tips or shared experiences. If anyone’s in the same boat or wants to chat, feel free to reach out.

1hbhks0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1hbhks0/financialcareer_slump_having_trouble_not_seeing/,"financial/career slump, having trouble not seeing it as a ""moral"" failing","I guess this is a bit of a vent post but also in general would like to hear other women's experiences with similar life decisions.

I'm 33F, turning 34 soon, and I was definitely an ""overachiever"" growing up. Worked my ass off in highschool, worked my ass off in college, worked very very hard through my 20s. I never made a lot of money (worked in publishing for a while, which, like, lol, not a money bringer at all, and did freelance on the side) but I saved VERY aggressively. I let myself have nice things once in a while, but at the end of the day a specific percentage of every single paycheck and invoice went immediately into savings, and then eventually when I learned how, into a keeping-it-relatively-safe managed portfolio.

when I was 30 I got a MUCH more prestigious \[contract\] job in a different industry, albeit a much more stressful one, and by then I was just completely burnt out. I never used PTO through my 20s, and now i was making more money but did not have PTO to take at all, and my bosses completely crushed my self worth at this job. Any fuel I had left in the tank just evaporated over the two years I worked there.

I left that job, and have just gone to freelance. I make a fraction of what I used to make. Money stresses me, i have to chase invoices which is upsetting, but I do have that savings, and I've been telling myself it's OK to have a year or two where money isn't coming in like it used to, and I just have to be smart. That being said, on good days, im happier than I've ever been in my life. I take mornings off just to sit with my coffee sometimes. I make my own schedule-- some days I work really late, some days I don't work at all, and as long as I hit my clients' delivery deadlines I have no one micromanaging me except myself. It feels really, really good, for the most part.

but I am having trouble shaking the GUILT of it, and the anxiety that I'm just ""wrong"" for it. I feel less upset about not having regular income to support myself, and more upset about how guilty this all makes me feel. like i feel GUILTY for touching money I saved for specific reasons like this. I am feeling GUILTY for taking time to heal from getting a ""dream job"" just to get abused, and not being able to put up with it any longer. I feel intensely guilty that I am putting grueling career progression to the side for the first time in my life.

I guess there is a part of me that is scared that within the next couple years all jobs in the arts will completely disappear because of what AI is doing across all of our industries, but I also think that that sort of catastrophic thinking isn't realistic at all. I've always been incredibly flexible and I always land on my feet. I've always Made It Happen. and right now, I'm out of gas mentally, working enough so I can take care of myself, but making significantly less money. Why do I feel SO guilty about that?

What's my question here... I guess... did any of you all make a similar decision? were you able to get back on your feet and restart after resting? is taking a year or two-- utilizing funds you put aside-- really that bad? and it's not like i have ZERO income-- that is NOT possible for me-- I'm just making enough to get by and feeling pretty good about it. But there's this nagging invisible demon next to me telling me I'm a failure for taking a rest and I'll never get back on track because of this.

just want to chat with other people like this... no one I know has done anything like this, as a choice. It's hard not to feel judged by both myself and my other similarly-career-oriented friends.  


TL;DR-- my career has been at the center of my existence my entire life, and i'm putting it aside. I feel guilty for it and don't know how to grapple with this guilt, despite having the means to take a break. ",7,1733879106.0,AskWomenOver30,5,1.0,False

The orange jumpsuit sagged off the boy’s right shoulder. The baggy sleeve bunched up past his elbow, his wrist cuffed to a metal link on the table. He stared down at his hands. The bruises on his face darker and more severe under the accusatory glare of the jail lights.

The door behind Alan opened and a short, portly man in a brown polyester suit bustled into the room as if blown in by a storm.

“Howdy, howdy,” he said, dropping a fat briefcase—the same color as his suit—onto the table. Papers crept out the sides, looking to escape as soon as it was opened. He wiped little drops of water off his bald pate with a blue handkerchief procured from an internal pocket. “What a day for a snowstorm. It’s gonna get worse. I got a trick knee for weather.”

With that, he plopped down across from Alan and peered at him over the top of bifocals held together at the bridge with electrical tape. He extended his hand. “Name’s Mickey Verona. Lawyer’s my game. I’ve been appointed counsel for, um…” He popped the briefcase open—a page fell onto the table—and thumbed through a manila folder. “…for Mr. Builds A Fire.” He looked through the glass at Francis and seemed taken aback by the boy in the chair. “And you are?”

“Alan Smith from the mental health clinic. Francis is my client.”

“Okay, Alan, I have one question for you. Friend or foe?”

“What?”

“*Friend* or *foe*?”

“I’m his psychiatrist.”

“Right, AKA shrink. I had a girlfriend once who made me go to Gestalt therapy for two months before she dumped me. I’m still having goddamn flashbacks. Hear me? We don’t have a lot of time. King Kong will be here in about thirty seconds. His job is to break that kid. My job is to make him sound innocent and believable.”

Mickey Verona looked sternly at Alan over his spectacles and repeated slowly, “Friend or foe?”

“Friend,” said Alan. “I’m a friend.”

“Make sure of that.”

The door opened and Comstock entered with his lawful presence. The redheaded deputy slipped in after him and closed the door.

“Gentlemen,” said the massive cop, “you can observe, but don’t interfere.”

Mickey laughed. “That’s a good one. Use it on all the girls? I’ll need a moment with my client before you start. Mic off. And I’m going to sit right there next to him as you do your… thing.”

Comstock glowered at the lawyer, who was easily half his size. “Five minutes. Make it snappy, Verona. I don’t have all day for your bullshit.”

“Thank you. I missed you too.” Mickey flipped a red switch next to the two-way mirror, cutting off sound and communication to the interrogation room. “Dr. Smith here will be joining me, as he *is* the boy’s mental health provider.”

Alan could see Comstock’s face getting increasingly red and wondered if it could be a lawyer strategy to piss off the interrogator.

Francis watched them warily when they entered the room, but then, for an instant, he almost smiled before he went back to staring at the table.

“Hi, Francis. It’s me again,” said Alan.

Now the boy did smile. “You keep turning up,” he said.

“I do, like a bad penny. Francis, this is Mickey Verona. He’s going to be your lawyer.”

“Hi.”

“Hi there.” Mickey grabbed his free hand and shook it. “No time to get friendly, kid. Rule number one, you don’t say shit to the police unless I say so. Rule number two, you have to tell me everything, one hundred percent honesty. Got it?”

Francis nodded.

“Good. We have four minutes. Answer my questions.”

“Okay.”

“Francis, did you sexually assault Amy Taylor on October 29?”

“No… no!”

“Did you do anything pervy with her ever? You know, touch her tits, hand on ass, etcetera?”

“Mr. Verona, I don’t think—”

“Please, Dr. Smith, let me do my job. Francis?”

“I never did.”

“Did you try to attack Mx. Dale, physically or sexually?”

*“No!”*

“Then why did Mackenzie Winesworth punch you?”

Francis lowered his eyes to the table. “That guy hates my guts.”

A buzzer went off. Comstock’s voice came over the intercom. “Alright, Verona. Time’s up.”

Mickey gave a thumbs up at the window.

“Okay, kid. I’ll be right here next to you. Dr. Smith will be behind that window, watching the whole time.”

As Alan left the room, he had to step aside for Comstock coming through the door like a wild boar.

Deputy Wolf sat at the table next to Verona’s scuffed briefcase, a pad of paper in front of her.

“Why don’t *you* do the interview?” he asked.

“Comstock’s taking this one personally,” said Wolf. “I was the responding officer, so I have a right to follow up. If I don’t do this, it’s just another piece of procedure that gets incinerated in the barn fire that is Comstock.”

“I don’t see why he couldn’t stay at the clinic. We have security. He’s just a fucking kid.” His heart pumped. The muscles in his neck strained. If there had been a little glass ashtray like there always was in the old movies, he would have smashed it against the wall.

“Dr. Smith, I need to ask you something.” The deputy’s voice held that note of control that must have been handed out along with law enforcement badges.

“Okay.”

“I was the one who processed Francis. You know… I cleaned him up and got him changed.” A tremble in her voice; her emerald gaze searching him for an answer. “What happened to him?”

“It’s not exactly something a kid explains in an essay,” said Alan. “You need to build a dialogue. Lay a foundation of trust. Kind of hard to do when a raving madman with a badge slams him against the wall.”

She looked down at the table. Her hands were small; An elegant finger tranced a vein in the faux-marble surface. “I’m sorry. I should have—”

“Look, Deputy—”

“Just Gwen. I don’t play the authority game. Comstock does that enough for the whole department.”

“Gwen. I don’t know what happened to him. He has a story. It’s hard to believe. I need more time.” Inside the interrogation room, Comstock was checking the boy’s shackles while Mickey shuffled through a notebook. Francis stared through the two-way mirror as if he could see beyond his own reflection, as if he were looking at Alan. “To be honest. I’m just his initial evaluator. I’m not… I mean… I don’t work with kids. They’ll assign him someone else.”

“The way you stood up to Comstock this morning. I hope you’re the one. What they’re going to do to him. He’ll need someone strong.”

*Strong…*

“The scars. Did he say anything to you?” asked Alan.

“No, but I’ve seen sever trauma before. I know a broken spirit. I didn’t put it in my report yet, but I’ll have to—soon.”

The speaker to the observation room came alive in tinny resonance with the lawyer’s voice. “Francis, this is Acting Sheriff Comstock. I’m sure he needs no introduction, right?”

Comstock leaned forward, hulking over the boy. “State your name and birthdate for the record.”

Francis looked at Mickey.

“Don’t look at him. Look at me,” Comstock barked.

“Saint-Francis Builds A Fire. March 15, 2160. But on my s-school papers, it just says F-Francis Builds A Fire. The S-Saint got lost somewhere.” He stumbled over the joke, falling quiet at the end; he had probably used before to break the awkward ice.

“Is this funny to you?” said Comstock.

“No, sir.”

“It better not be.”

The boy nodded. He picked at a scab on the back of his hand.

Alan felt his blood run cold. He wasn’t speaking to anyone as the words came out. “What did he say? His birthday?”

“3.15.59” Wolf read from her notes.

“Christ.” He rubbed his face with his hands; a clammy sweat from his brow transferred to his palms.

“What’s wrong?” said Wolf.

He could only shake his head. A vision of decking Paul Murphy played out before him.

“I need to remind you, Francis, that you’re in the custody of the Lake County Sheriff’s Department. You have been read your rights. Anything you say or do here can and will be used against you in a court of law. Your attorney is present.”

“I understand,” Francis whispered.

“You’re gonna have to speak up!”

“Sorry.”

“Do you know why you’re here?”

“Objection,” Mickey said. “That question implies guilt. My client does not need to answer it. Don’t answer that, Francis.”

“For fuck’s sake, Verona, save it for the judge.”

Francis kept quiet.

Comstock rubbed the back of his bullish neck. “Francis, you’re here because Amy Taylor is in a hospital, and two witnesses say they saw you doing something to her. Additionally, one witness, Ms. Dale, says you tried to assault her too.”

“I didn’t Amy’s my friend. She’s nice to me. And why the hell would I want to touch *Mx.* Dale? Shi’s like a hundred.”

Mickey tried to hide a grin by looking at his notebook.

“Watch your tongue, boy.” Comstock shoved a finger in Francis’s face. “Then why did *Ms.* Dale say she saw you touching Amy?”

“Excuse me, Sheriff,” said Verona. He leaned over and whispered to Francis.

The boy nodded.

“I wasn’t doing anything bad to Amy.”

“Why were you touching her? You know about the ‘No Touch’ law?”

“Yeah. It’s a stupid law. Nobody follows it.”

“Apparently it’s there for a reason. I’ll ask again. Why were you touching Amy Taylor when Ms. Dale came into the room?”

“I had to.”

“Excuse me? I couldn’t hear you.”

“I said I had to. I had to touch her. That’s how it works.”

“That’s how what works?”

“Sheriff Comstock, my client already answered.”

“One more time, Verona, and I’ll arrest you for interfering with an investigation.” The cop’s hands were balled into fists on the table. “Francis, that’s how *what* works?”

“The enchantment,” implored Francis.

“Say again, what?”

“The magic,” said the boy, raising his chin, looking straight ahead, but not at the overbearing police officer, looking through the mirrored glass—at Alan.

“Does this magic involve any sexual—”

“Stop! Objection. My client has a right to consult with his mental health provider.”

“No,” said Comstock. “He answers the questions.”

“It’s okay, Mr. Verona. I’ll tell the truth.”

“Francis, Ms. Dale says she saw you touching Amy on her breast, and you were kissing her neck.”

“No. Mx. Dale is mistaken.”

“Are you saying Ms. Dale is lying?”

“No, but shi doesn’t know what shi saw. Shi doesn’t know what I was doing.”

“So, you *were* touching Amy Taylor?”

“Yes.”

“Were you sexually aroused, Francis?”

“Comstock, damn it! Objection. Francis, don’t—”

“No. No. No!” Francis said, pressing his uncuffed hand to his forehead. “It’s not about sex. I was touching her heart. and I was touching her head. I was guiding her through it.”

“Guiding her through it?” Comstock laughed sardonically. “Is that what you call it? Just what exactly were you guiding her through?”

“Through the Veil!” Francis shouted, wiping tears from his one good eye with his loose sleeve.

“Sheriff, unless my client can consult, I will have this interrogation ruled inadmissible.”

Comstock slammed his fists on the table, making both Francis and Mickey jump. “I know what you’re doing, you greasy snake!” He pointed a trembling finger at the lawyer. “You’re angling to play the crazy card with this little pervert.”

“You’re not the court of law, Comstock,” retorted Verona.

“Francis?” Comstock pushed.

Francis clenched his fists and closed his eyes. “I was guiding her through…” The boy searched for the words. “Sh-she… was lost in there. I was helping her get through… It-it w-was s-so dark, and they were hunting her. She had heavy things, s-so I carried them for her and helped her b-because I w-was th-th-there before. I knew the way. It was dark, and and⁠—”

“Bullshit! That girl is lying in a hospital bed, not talking to anyone. What the hell did you do to her?”

With as much bravado as a thirteen-almost-fourteen-year-old boy could muster in the presence of a force like Comstock, Francis said, “It’s because… she’s still lost. She’s still there. But I think she saw it. I think she saw the path. Maybe she’ll be okay. I think she’ll get through it. Amy is strong, and smart.” Francis smiled and chewed on his fat lip.

Comstock’s chair screeched when he stood. “Shut up! Just shut up. You’re not helping yourself. No one is going to buy your lies. Francis Builds A Fire, I am remanding you into custody where you will await trial on the charges of aggravated sexual assault against Amy Taylor and the attempted assault of Dorothy Dale.”

“The prosecutor sets the charges, man.” Mickey shook his head.

“The prosecutor will back me up. You know it.” Comstock signaled the camera.

A deputy with a tattooed head entered through a door at the back of the room and unlocked Francis.

Mickey Verona whispered something to the boy and put a calming hand on his shoulder.

The man twisted Francis’s arms behind his back and cuffed him. Together, he and Comstock pulled Francis away into the jail’s depths.

“Oh my God,” said Deputy Wolf, letting out a sigh.

Alan’s heartbeat pounded in his chest.

Mickey Verona emerged from the interrogation room and picked up his briefcase. “Well, that went better than I had anticipated,” he said, pushing up his glasses.

“What the hell are you talking about? They’re going to charge him,” said Alan.

“They were always going to charge him,” he replied. He turned to Deputy Wolf. “What kind of outfit do you guys have going here? Sheriff Ryder is probably rolling in his grave.”

“Some of us try to be good cops,” she said.

Mickey shook his head. “By terrible coincidence, Amy Taylor’s father is John Taylor—state senator, former marine war hero, CEO of Taylor Securities, and contender for some big-ass role in Allgood’s administration.”

“That shouldn’t matter,” said Alan.

“Oh, it matters. Do you know what the news headlines are going to say tomorrow?

“No.”

“John Taylor does,” said Mickey. You should talk to the boy. He’s probably scared shitless.”

“I will. I need to make a phone call,” Alan said.

“They’re putting him in holding,” said Deputy Wolf.

“Holding? I want him in a juvenile unit,” said Mickey.

“We can’t put him in there. He could be around other children. You’ll have to petition the judge.”

“This place is insane,” said Alan.

“Like I said, some of us try to be good cops.” She put a reassuring hand on his arm. “I have desk duty for the next few days. I’ll do my best to ensure he’s treated fairly.”

“Ahem,” the lawyer cleared his throat. “Anyway, I’m hungry, and we got a lot of work to do, Dr. Smith. Let’s make it a working lunch. Here’s my office. Stop by. Ask for Mickey.” He handed Alan a business card.

“Dee’s? Your office is the diner by the lake?”

“Yep, booth C-3 in the back. I find a constant supply of food and coffee helps me think.”",1,1733879087.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Known for its rich probiotic content and refreshing taste, kombucha is often touted as a health drink with a variety of uses. But what exactly is kombucha used for? Let’s dive into the many benefits and purposes of this fermented favorite.

# 1. Promoting Gut Health 🦠

* **Probiotics**: Kombucha is packed with live beneficial bacteria and yeast that support a healthy gut microbiome.
* **Digestive Aid**: Its probiotics can help improve digestion and reduce bloating, making it a great addition to a gut-friendly diet.

# 2. Supporting Immune Function 🛡️

* **Rich in Antioxidants**: Kombucha, especially when made with green or black tea, contains antioxidants that help combat free radicals in the body.
* **Boosting Gut-Immune Connection**: A healthy gut microbiome strengthens your immune system, and kombucha helps maintain that balance.

# 3. Providing a Natural Energy Boost ⚡

* **Low Levels of Caffeine**: The tea base of kombucha provides a gentle pick-me-up, making it a great alternative to coffee or sugary energy drinks.
* **B-Vitamins**: These vitamins, produced during fermentation, can contribute to increased energy and reduced fatigue.

# 4. Hydration with a Twist 💧

* **Refreshing Alternative**: Kombucha is a flavorful option to stay hydrated, especially for those looking to cut down on sugary sodas.
* **Fizzy Treat**: Its natural carbonation makes it feel like an indulgent drink while being healthier.

# 5. Supporting Detoxification 🧽

* **Glucuronic Acid**: Kombucha contains this compound, which is believed to aid the liver in detoxifying the body.
* **Cleansing Properties**: Many drink kombucha as part of a detox regimen for its purported ability to flush out toxins.

# 6. Encouraging Healthy Weight Management ⚖️

* **Low in Calories**: With typically fewer calories than sodas or juices, kombucha can be a satisfying, low-calorie drink option.
* **Appetite Control**: Some people find that kombucha helps curb sugar cravings and appetite.

# 7. Enjoying as a Versatile Beverage 🍹

* **On Its Own**: A chilled bottle of kombucha is a perfect pick-me-up.
* **In Recipes**: Use kombucha as a mixer for mocktails or cocktails, or add it to smoothies for an extra probiotic punch.
* **Cooking with Kombucha**: Try it in salad dressings or marinades for a tangy twist.

# 8. Building a Healthy Routine 🕒

* Kombucha is often enjoyed as part of a holistic health routine alongside a balanced diet, regular exercise, and mindfulness practices.
* Many kombucha fans sip it during the day as a functional beverage to support overall well-being.

# Is Kombucha for Everyone?

While kombucha has many benefits, it’s not for everyone:

* **Sensitivity to Caffeine or Acidity**: Some people may experience heartburn or discomfort.
* **Alcohol Content**: Kombucha contains trace amounts of alcohol due to fermentation, so it may not be suitable for everyone.
* **Consult Your Doctor**: If you’re pregnant, nursing, or have health conditions, check with a healthcare professional before adding kombucha to your routine.

# Final Thoughts

Kombucha is a versatile and beneficial beverage with a wide range of uses, from promoting gut health to providing a refreshing energy boost. Whether you enjoy it for its probiotic benefits, unique taste, or as a healthy soda alternative, kombucha is a great addition to a balanced lifestyle.
