She‚Äôs vegan. We started chatting about food, harmless, right? Except somehow a simple question about ‚Äúhow long have you been vegan?‚Äù slid into a debate about ethics, animals, and climate.

I caught myself getting defensive, even though I don‚Äôt usually care what other people eat. She wasn‚Äôt rude exactly, but her tone felt like a quiet accusation. Suddenly my sandwich felt heavier than it was.

I took a sip of water and reminded myself: this isn‚Äôt about winning an argument; it‚Äôs about understanding someone else‚Äôs values. I softened my voice, asked more open questions, and she relaxed too. By the end of the meal we were laughing about our shared love of coffee and bad reality TV.

Walking away, I realized food is never just food. It‚Äôs identity, ethics, habit, and family memories. And sometimes the tension we feel isn‚Äôt personal, it‚Äôs our own discomfort bumping into someone else‚Äôs choices.",1,1758859764.0,TheBigGirlDiary,0,1.0,False

1nqro5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nqro5g/daes_fight_or_flight_response_get_triggered_when/,DAE's fight or flight response get triggered when someone starts talking to you unexpectedly?,"I've noticed that when I'm talking with an individual or a group, e.g. a friend, or at a work meeting, I'm fine and can usually get through it in a semi-normal manner because I know I am expected to talk. However, if I'm in a situation where I'm suddenly expected to engage in spontaneous conversation with someone/a group without warning or preparation, such as a last minute invite to a busy work meeting, or like earlier today when a couple of Jehovah's Witnesses suddenly interrupted my morning coffee and smoke - I get an extremely chilling sense of dread, like I can feel the blood draining from my extremities, my eyes start darting everywhere looking for an excuse to exit the conversation, and the corners of my mouth start spasming uncontrollably because of a forced smile that I can't wipe off my face - not to mention the accompanying heart palpitations and rapid breathing - suffice it to say, I can't even form a sentence when in this state which always leads to a sense of shame and dreading the next inevitable 'attack'.

I have always linked this to my more generalised form of anxiety which is sort of always there lurking beneath the surface and has done since I was a child, but otherwise is under control through years of familiarity. But this very specific response is more recent, probably started when I was 19 or 20 (29 now), and whenever I have searched online for my symptoms, I only get a vague description of social anxiety disorder or social phobia, which seems to be more about a fear of how you are perceived by others which doesn't really factor in my mind. My physical symptoms don't even go through the psychological phase before they come on suddenly, i.e. before I even have time to think ""oh god here it comes again"" - it has me wondering if this is actually a complex trauma-response rather than a standard panic attack, surely if it was social anxiety then it would happen more often and during any conversation, prepared or not? I can recall the first episode, which was quite traumatic for me due to it being quite public and an 'all eyes on me' moment during an extended family gathering.

Anyway, I'm not seeking medical advice or a diagnosis here from Reddit - just interested to see if anyone else has any similar experience of this? I'm fed up of avoiding situations that might trigger this response, which has cost me a lot of opportunities in life.",1,1758859712.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

Every time I opened it, I braced myself for an avalanche of forgotten takeout containers, questionable science experiments in Tupperware, and Liam's ever-expanding collection of artisanal coffee beans. Honestly, it was stressing me out. Chloe, our resident queen of organization, was lowkey about to lose it, and I couldn't blame her. The passive-aggressive notes were starting to multiply, migrating from the whiteboard to actual Post-its stuck to offending items. I knew we needed a pow-wow, like, yesterday.

The breaking point came when Chloe‚Äôs carefully portioned smoothie packs disappeared, replaced by what looked suspiciously like a week-old pizza box. Liam, bless his heart, was naturally oblivious, still buzzing from his latest cold brew concoction. I saw the look on Chloe's face ‚Äì a mix of disbelief and pure rage. ""Maya,"" she said, her voice dangerously calm, ""did you see my smoothie ingredients?"" I shook my head, already dreading the inevitable confrontation. I *knew* Liam had just shoved her stuff aside to make room for his oat milk hoard. It was a classic Apartment 3B fridge skirmish, but this one felt different. This one had stakes, you know? Our fragile peace was hanging by a thread.

I decided to act as the neutral party. ""Okay, guys,"" I started at dinner that night, cutting through the awkward silence. ""We need to talk about the fridge situation. No cap, it‚Äôs getting out of hand."" Liam, to his credit, actually looked up from his phone. Chloe just crossed her arms. I suggested a ""fridge renegotiation"" ‚Äì everyone gets one shelf, and the door is shared for condiments. Any mystery items older than three days get tossed. Liam was hesitant about his ""coffee lab"" space, and Chloe was skeptical it would last. But we talked it out. We even used a whiteboard to assign zones. It felt kinda silly, but also, necessary.

The first week was a bit of a chaotic adjustment, with Liam ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô migrating his kombucha into Chloe‚Äôs dairy-free zone, but honestly, we laughed it off. He even helped her find new smoothie ingredients. Slowly, our fridge transformed from a battleground into, well, a fridge. It wasn't perfect, but it was *our* system. And seeing Chloe‚Äôs neatly labeled items alongside Liam‚Äôs slightly-less-chaotic coffee supplies actually felt‚Ä¶ nice. It showed we could figure things out, even the small, seemingly silly stuff. We learned to communicate before the tiny frustrations became massive blowouts. It was a good reminder that shared living isn't just about sharing space, but sharing responsibility and a little bit of grace, too.

1nqrf54,https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasting/comments/1nqrf54/that_moment_when_ai_actually_saved_my_podcast_and/,That moment when AI actually saved my podcast (and my sanity),"Okay so bear with me cause this is kinda wild and I'm still processing what happened last week...

Been podcasting for almost a year now, nothing huge, just my little corner of the internet talking about tech and creativity. But man, the GRIND was getting to me. You know that feeling when you love something but it starts feeling like homework? Yeah, that.

**The 3am breakdown**

Picture this: It's wednesday night (technically thursday morning lol), I've got an episode due in 8 hours, and I'm sitting there with like 4 hours of raw interview audio from this AMAZING conversation about AI ethics. Great content, but my brain is just... done. Like completely fried.

I literally typed ""how to not hate podcasting anymore"" into google at 3:17am. Not my proudest moment.

**The rabbit hole that changed everything**

So I'm doom-scrolling through podcast forums and someone mentioned using AI tools for production. My first thought? ""Great, another thing to make us all sound the same."" But desperation makes you try weird stuff, right?

Started small - tried some transcription tools, basic stuff. Then stumbled onto this thing called AIdeaFlow that actually understands podcast structure? Like, not just ""here's your transcript bye"" but actually helping shape episodes from messy ideas.

**The ""holy sh\*t"" moment**

Here's where it gets interesting... I uploaded my disaster of an interview (seriously, we went SO off topic, talked about everything from quantum computing to our favorite pizza toppings). Expected nothing.

This tool somehow found the narrative thread I couldn't see. Pulled out themes, suggested segment breaks, even helped craft transitions that actually made sense. It wasn't writing FOR me - more like having a really smart friend who's good at organizing thoughts when you're too tired to think straight.

**What actually happened to my workflow**

* Used to spend 6-8 hours per episode on post-production
* Now? Maybe 2-3 hours max
* The extra time? Actually engaging with listeners, planning better interviews, you know... the fun stuff
* Last week published 2 episodes instead of barely managing 1

**The weird psychological shift**

This is the part that surprised me most - I actually enjoy it again?? Like, when you remove all the tedious structure stuff, you remember why you started. For me it was always about the conversations, the connections. Not spending hours figuring out where to place ad breaks or how to smooth out transitions.

Had my best episode last week. Guest was talking about imposter syndrome in tech (ironic, right?) and because I wasn't stressed about the technical stuff, I could actually LISTEN. Asked follow-up questions I never would've thought of if I was mentally planning the edit.

**Real talk for fellow burnt out creators**

Look, I get the resistance to AI. I really do. Felt like I was ""cheating"" at first. But here's the thing - your voice, your perspective, your weird tangents about pizza during serious interviews - that's what makes your show YOURS.

The AI just helps you not lose your mind getting it out there.

Some episodes I lean on it heavy, others barely at all. Depends on my energy, the content, how much coffee I've had. It's just another tool, like my mic or my editing software (which, btw, nobody calls cheating even though it does a ton of work for us).

**Where I'm at now**

Three weeks into this experiment. Published 5 episodes (personal record). Got my first sponsor reach-out (!!!). Most importantly? I'm excited about next week's recording instead of dreading the post-production.

Still learning, still finding the balance. Sometimes the AI suggestions are spot-on, sometimes they're hilariously wrong (it once suggested I make an entire segment about pizza after that quantum computing tangent... actually wait, that might work?).

**Question for the hive mind**

Anyone else playing with AI in their workflow? What's working? What's absolutely not working?

Cause honestly, we're all just making this up as we go, and I'd rather figure it out together than pretend I have all the answers.

Also if anyone wants to talk about quantum computing OR pizza, I'm aparently your guy now üòÖ

1nqregu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Sunraku_San/comments/1nqregu/dont_ever_get_carried_away_and_distracted_again/,Don't ever get carried away and distracted again,"I was surprised to learn about why I get distracted and there's actually a way to stop

I used to believe that technology and social media were the culprits for why I'm constantly distracted. Turns out, there's a surprising reason for why we get distracted so easily, and it's not due to technology.

Turns out, the reason we're constantly checking social media, reading emails, get up to make coffee or eat mindlessly is all due to internal triggers. These triggers can be in the form of boredom, loneliness, anxiety, inner emptiness, stress, or something else happening on the inside.

The way to overcome this is pretty simple, and I've been testing this myself and it's been helping me.

1. If you're in the middle of doing something and you get the urge to get distracted, become aware that you're getting distracted
2. Be curious: what you are really feeling (anxious, bored, lonely, etc...)? Place awareness on that and be okay with the emotion/trigger
3. Time box yourself: give yourself 1-3 minutes to allow the distraction, then go back to what you were doing.
4. OR, simply be aware of the emotion, take a few deep breaths, don't give into the mind, and go back to doing what you were doing after the few breaths.

Awareness and mindfulness are key to overcoming the distracting behavior patterns. After a little while, you'll retrain your brain and become distracted far less.

I hope this helps! It's been helping me over the last few weeks.",1,1758858864.0,u_Sunraku_San,0,1.0,False

1nqr4wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloggersCommunity/comments/1nqr4wj/flexible_packaging_companies_transforming_the/,Flexible Packaging Companies: Transforming the Future of Product Packaging,"In the global marketplace, packaging is more than a container‚Äîit is a communication tool, a sustainability measure, and a driver of consumer experience. Among the many packaging solutions available today, flexible packaging has risen to prominence due to its cost-efficiency, adaptability, and eco-friendly potential. **Flexible packaging companies** are leading this transformation, offering innovative solutions that cater to industries ranging from food and beverage to healthcare, cosmetics, and consumer goods. With the ability to reduce material waste, enhance product shelf life, and deliver strong branding opportunities, these companies are reshaping how businesses approach packaging in the 21st century.

One of the biggest advantages provided by [**flexible packaging companies**](https://mtpak.com/mtpak-packaging-products) is the **versatility of their product offerings**. Unlike rigid packaging that is limited in shape and utility, flexible packaging includes formats such as stand-up pouches, flat-bottom bags, side-gusseted packs, and resealable pouches. This range of options allows businesses to tailor packaging to specific product requirements, whether preserving the freshness of roasted coffee beans, maintaining the sterility of pharmaceutical products, or improving the portability of snacks and beverages. By integrating features such as zippers, spouts, or transparent windows, these companies make packaging more consumer-friendly while ensuring optimal protection and durability. This adaptability has made flexible packaging an attractive choice for businesses seeking both functionality and innovation.

In addition to functionality, **customization and brand differentiation** are core strengths of flexible packaging companies. In highly competitive markets, packaging often serves as the first point of contact between a product and its potential buyer. Flexible packaging offers large printable surfaces and supports advanced digital and rotogravure printing, enabling brands to showcase vibrant colors, high-resolution graphics, and detailed product information. Whether a brand wants to highlight its eco-conscious mission with minimalist designs or capture attention with bold and colorful visuals, flexible packaging can be tailored to align with brand identity. For e-commerce brands in particular, where customers interact with packaging before the product itself, creating a strong unboxing experience through personalized designs can significantly boost brand recognition and loyalty.

The shift toward sustainability has also positioned flexible packaging companies as **leaders in eco-friendly innovation**. With rising consumer demand and stricter regulations on single-use plastics, these companies are investing heavily in recyclable, biodegradable, and compostable materials. Solutions such as mono-material pouches, recyclable films, and paper-based laminates are reducing environmental impact while maintaining performance standards like moisture resistance and product freshness. Additionally, flexible packaging requires fewer raw materials and occupies less space during transportation, lowering both production costs and carbon emissions. By offering sustainable alternatives, flexible packaging companies are helping brands meet their corporate social responsibility goals while appealing to eco-conscious consumers who increasingly make purchasing decisions based on sustainability.

Looking ahead, **the role of flexible packaging companies will continue to evolve with technology and consumer expectations**. Emerging trends such as smart packaging‚Äîintegrating QR codes, freshness indicators, and augmented reality features‚Äîwill enhance the consumer experience and improve supply chain transparency. At the same time, the growing demand for small batch production and quick turnarounds will push companies to expand digital printing capabilities, making premium packaging more accessible to startups and small businesses. As innovation accelerates, flexible packaging companies will remain vital partners for brands seeking to balance performance, aesthetics, and sustainability. Their forward-thinking approach not only redefines packaging as a business tool but also paves the way for a greener, more consumer-centric future.",2,1758858000.0,BloggersCommunity,0,1.0,False

**Author's note**: so making some slight tweaks to the story, I know it's only the third chapter but better to get it done early then wait. Firstly changing the age of Lily and Ezekiel and secondly adjusting the timeline a bit to better suit this. It's only the background timeline so you wont notice it.

Lily is five years of age and Ezekiel being two going on three. I'm doing this since it's been pointed out they're more coherent then their previous age group should. It was simply a mistake on my part as I thought Farsul matured a bit faster than humans. And while it's never explicitly stated in the lore how fast they age, I'm just gonna play it safe so no confusion is done

**Blooming fruit.**

2137 April 17th [Standard Human Time]

Memory transcript: Vena, adjusting Farsulian mother.

I can recall the first time I encountered humans; despite my memory of those days after my old life but still before the facility being mere fragments of memories and lashes of consciousness, I remember everything that day vividly. It was as if I awoke from a slumber that stretched so long, time became nought but dust.

A nightmare that seemed to never end, suddenly ceasing to be without warning.

It was one of many of humanity's cattle rescue operations, though not one through the exchange of non sapient cattle‚Äìbut one through blood and claw. The ship that housed the other cattle and I, even though I never got a good look at the outside, I'm sure its frame looked like something out of my worst nightmares.

If the exterior hull was something from my nightmares then its insides were certainly worse, metal walls covered in aged rust and blood a vast array of colorful malady. The stench of death permeated through the air and carried with it a miasma of lingering suffering. 

**Hell, manifested into reality.**

Aboard the ship whose name I never learned, I and many others were too loopy to ever find out which ship we were being traded or transferred to, a loud crash rang from the hull and throughout the cattle ship knocking me and others out of their feed induced stupor.

Panic and the instincts of innocent prey conditioned to be little more than obedient cattle took over in a heartbeat. Soon enough, chaos engulfed the pens where I resided, not even the Arxur guards could quell our stampede. Ironically the restraints that kept me confined, saved mine and other's lives. Unknown to me or any of my fellows at the time, UN soldiers had boarded the ship. 



Humanity's methods of war, unlike the Arxur's, were precise, surgical. Where the Arxur would smash‚Äìcreating noise and spreading fear to quash any chance or idea of counter attacks, it's why so many raids end in vast numbers of innocents taken. They cause as much destruction and chaos as they possibly can.

Brutal, crude yet effective like a club. 

Humans on the other paw, went about assaults with precision; they disable a vessel's chance to flee or fight back. Their warriors then board it and like a needle injecting poison into veins; shutting down any opposition before they even had any idea what was occurring. Completing their objectives and destroying vital ship assets with little to no wasted energy, movement or time.

Efficient, cold; it was no wonder that within less than a half a claw the ship was destroyed, its crew captured and ‚Äòcargo‚Äô secured.

Abruptly though not surprisingly my herd of thought ends. Lily and I have reached the edge of our home district and into the next.

District 175-E10 **Forest bell**

One of two of our neighboring districts, like the cradle, it was mostly a commercial district restaurants, shops and other such things

The difference between the two wasn't a stark contrast not in infrastructure. Despite its stagnant decline, the cradle our district looked pretty much like any other. Only residents such as myself could really tell the border between.

The contrast between the sector‚Äôs buildings was subtle, those who either weren't from this side of Dayside, wouldn't even notice they entered another district. The only noticeable difference was in the sheer concentration of people, It was as Lukas‚Äô people say, *‚Äúlike night and day‚Äù* one scratch it was like I was wandering inside a ghost town with a purpose. The next, it felt like I finally entered Dayside, the real Dayside.

The streets were packed to say the least, Venlil of nearly every color. A sea of white wool occasionally broken by splotches of blacks and browns. I'd blend right in, from a bird's eye view at least. On the ground though, I stuck out‚Äìespecially to the Venlil. Already I could see the occasional glare and sneers.

I grumbled internally knowing fully well I'll have to walk this route almost every day to reach the nearest available station. It's not like the cradle didn't have its very own, but the frequency of stops at our aforementioned station remained‚Ä¶ *inconsistent.* The station, like our district, wasn't abandoned or decrepit or anything of that sort. Its employees always showed up, but they might as well be being paid to stand around.

With the eyes upon me that I can see and those only felt boring into my blind spots, I try to maneuver through the herd as fast as I could, while trying to prevent more notice falling upon us.

The walk over to the station could've been easier. But it being Lily's first day at a real pupcare facility, made her excitement a bit of detriment. Hopping around, tugging me every which way babbling loudly about how excited she was in that standard gibberish mixed with actual words all pups seem to use.

More people are looking, I can feel it, I know they are looking at us. The mere thought sends a chill down my spine. Attention isn't a good thing especially for us Farsul nowadays. Incidents have happened, nearly all involving the few Kolishians, and Farsul in Sapient Coalition space. 

I see it all the time whenever I browse lazily on my holopad, I'd see videos or photos taken and uploaded by various accounts, accounts that seem almost proud or excited, showing these photos to the rest of the net. Like a pup showing their parents a test they passed with flying colors.

I need to do something, If I don't then‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

So many were bloody, it was a wonder those post weren't flagged and removed 

Despite many of these kinds of‚Ä¶ ‚Äòcontent‚Äô being few and far between, I didn't wanna risk it. Especially with Lily and no Lukas. Though I'd prefer it not happening at all, I'd take it just happening to me then myself with Lily.

The thought of reprimanding her and quelling her, was quickly replaced as soon as it entered. Another habit I picked up from Lukas, such techniques were tried true, quick and easy as well. Under normal circumstances; more specifically the younger me, would probably do it without a second thought just as my parents would do to me and my siblings as well if we acted in such a way in public. But Lukas has shown me that Lily and Ezekiel respond much better to positive reinforcement, and more gentle approaches.

‚ÄúLily!‚Äù I whisper hiss, the bustling of the packed city streets drowning my voice very well. ‚ÄúBehave, we'll miss the transport if you keep acting out‚Äù Taking a doc out of his pad rather than that of my parents, I only raise my voice in a firm tone to quell Lily's little rambunctious mood. Her tail stops its erratic wagging drooping a bit, ‚ÄúSorry mama‚Äù her eyes are cast down she returns to my side walking at pace even to mine.

I feel a slight sting in my chest at the sight but I bury it as I shake my head and continue on with her in tow.. I wasn't as soft as Lukas or his people would have been but I didn't know what else to do and like an annoying stench, the thought and the aching lingered


Now Lukas wasn't the indulgent parent by no means, not in my opinion at least, he wouldn't just bribe Lily and Ezekiel into behaving, he could and would be firm with her when the situation called for it. 

But by Farsulian standards he would be, which when I first witnessed him parenting my pups back when we weren't together, back when I was still at the facility being treated, I was very shocked to say the least. Not really by the methods per say, but rather it was a predator using such methods.

By all means, he's taken the role as the disciplinarian of our family and taken to it quite well I might add, he wasn't cruel or physical as one would expect of a predator, quite the opposite. As mentioned before his methods of discipline by Farsulian standards would be seen as quite‚Ä¶ soft. They are, mind you, but I can't deny they're effective.

‚Äî\/\/\/‚Äî\/\/\/‚Äî\/\/\/‚Äî\/\/\/‚Äî

We finally arrived at the station, the trek was long and tedious but we made it. Lily is taking the new sights, her innocent amazed wonder at such mundane things always perplexed me. 

To say the galaxy had gone all topsy turvy, would be the understatement of the century. And it all really started with the humans. Needless to say my head is still ringing from the many revelations piled upon me and catching up has been a headache let me tell you.

I was away, protector knows where, on some Elder-damned Arxur vessel when first contact was made. I **‚Äúmissed the Galaxy's character development‚Äù** As Samantha once put it.

I didn't really know or care much about what I was looking at when I interacted with them. I was too drugged up on that feed those lizard bastards made us ingest.

When I did come around, I freaked out. Of course I did. I was a prisoner to the Arxur for Protector-knows how long, only to be rescued by another species of sentient predators, who wouldn't freak out.

‚Ä¶

Humans, humans really are something, despite their obvious predatory nature, as evident to their eery comfort towards violence. I'll admit I thought describing them as nothing but bloodthirsty brutes was a perfectly apt description. But now after everything, It doesn't feel just to simply label them as predators and call it a paw. 

I would know, I have personal experience with **real** predators, and while humans do technically fall under that label there is so much more to them. Lukas has shown me that, time and time again in fact. My first impression of them was again during that rescue mission. A human squadron of soldiers had wrenched open the door to the pens that I was being held in. And I saw them more importantly I saw one with a good chunk of its mask broken and torn, Its uniform stained with blood.

The familiar binocular eye of a predator peering outwards, boring itself into my very soul as it had been done countless times by the countless lizards that came and went dragging screaming squealing prey away to decimation

That was my first sighting of a human, in that moment I saw another predator, a beast that would be hollow if not for the insatiable bloodlust that filled it.

But later on, during my stay at the facility I saw another sight, another side to humanity. That of what a normal prey would exhibit

Gentleness, compassion, empathy. Things you see in prey almost every scratch of every paw. Not something you'd expect a bloodthirsty beast to ever touch with their souls.

I know this sounds ridiculous, how could two aspects that are the antithesis to one another coexist peacefully. It doesn't make sense, I know that, even now I'm not fully sure how it's possible. 

*‚ÄòI just know it is‚Äô*

May the protector take me if I'm wrong or lying, but I can't deny or denounce what I saw and see nearly every paw with Lukas. I don't know how to describe humans properly, I guess they're just a sort of half predator half prey. 

I wonder if there is a word for that.

The transport likewise to the street is quite packed, not too much to the point you can't move, each person certainly still has their own space but all seats are taken and that leaves a few people standing. Luckily we managed to find an open seat quickly enough and Lily has taken residence upon my lap.

**Drip‚Ä¶ Drip‚Ä¶Drip**

I can hear the turning of the gears and the thrumming of the magnetic field guiding and gliding us upon the track, yet still it's not enough white noise to keep that burrowing thought quiet.

My attention goes to Lily once more. At this moment, I hate that I can tell how she's feeling, guilt stings itself in my chest like a shadestalkers claw. But we can't take risks. Not now, maybe not ever. I just wish she could understand that.

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

By the elders it shames me to no end but I can't stop the idea creeping into my mind. How would Lukas handle this, these aren't even his pups by blood. For elders sake he's a predator handling prey younglings and yet‚Ä¶ it works every time, despite the rarity of them, anytime Lily or Ezekiel begin to act out, he's there to quell their tantrums. With ease mind you!

*‚ÄòHow come I can't do that?! I'm their damned mother!‚Äô*

I stifle my tears, I resist clenching my paws down, I can't, I wont‚Ä¶ not while holding Lily.

‚Ä¶

*‚ÄòHow is he so good at it?‚Äô*

‚Ä¶

I'm grateful, I really am for how. The countless times where I didn't know what I was doing, he was there. When I felt like it was too much, there he was.

But I don't get it, before the raid, before being taken. I spent so much of my life preparing, making myself ready to be a mother just as my mother did for me and my siblings. My parents worked so hard to get that deal with Kullic‚Äôs family, our inweaving ceremony was the physical entwinement of such an agreement.

I‚Ä¶ I miss those days, if I'm to be honest.

But as if the universe itself was conspiring against me, back then at the facility I'd just freeze. 

**Drip‚Ä¶Drip‚Ä¶Drip**

*‚ÄòBeing a mother it was the one thing I'm supposed to be good at, and yet a Pred-‚Äô*

I inhale deeply, practiced and familiar. And viola, it's like twisting a valve. 

*‚Äôwhat would Lukas do?‚Äô* I ask that question once more, looking down at Lily who doesn't seem quite as sad anymore,  just quiet too quiet. Lukas; he'd probably talk to her, he always talks to them whenever they're down. Either that or play with them like he's a pup himself. 

*‚Äòthen again I wouldn't be surprised If he still was‚Äô*


Playing is out of discussion, public again. Talking would be best, but then again what would I say.

*‚ÄòHere goes‚Ä¶ something‚Äô*


‚ÄúLily?‚Äù I say, my tone in contrast this time, is soft but loud enough so it isn't drowned out, Lily perks up from her little malaise eye fixed on me, not in fear, just curiosity. ‚ÄúI'm sorry for snapping at you,‚Äù. I placed a paw over her head and began to rub and scratch her head, another doc taken from Lukas, it seems to do the trick. ‚ÄúBut you can't be acting like that, understand?‚Äù 

Lily looks down before giving me a nod. A very human nod. *‚ÄòI pray no one saw that‚Äô* I put aside that thought for now. What's next?

‚ÄúJust remember to behave okay,‚Äù Lily gives me another nod, ‚Äúokay mama‚Äù she speaks softly digging her head into my fur hugging me. Reciprocating the embrace I continue, not really knowing what will come out of my mouth next so I simply let the words spill. 

‚ÄúI know you're excited, I am too, I'm just worried about Lily. But I shouldn't be, I know you're gonna do great and make lotsa friends‚Äù that gets her tail wagging


Explain and encourage. I've seen Lukas do this countless times and it came out so naturally. Already I feel that weighted pressure not just be quelled for a bit but rather feel like it's completely lifted off of me. Again I don't know how or where Lukas would get this from, but I won't argue with the results, Farsulian techniques may have been quicker and easier, but his human approach to pup rearing certainly had its charm.

The rest of the ride goes off without incident nor complaint, a far cry to the stressful waking I had earlier this paw. Lily and I simply talk as mother and daughter. We jumped from topic to topic, no need to worry about formality or pace, we could just enjoy the ride and each other's company. It was a pleasant nice change of pace, I didn't even feel the eyes upon me throughout the ride.

**[10 Scratches pass]**

We arrive at our area of interest, fifth in a series of twenty something stops. A long way from home, Lukas didn't like the idea of Lily and I traveling so far away alone, it was the main reason he was against applying to an official pupcare facility. Advocating for Lily and Ezekiel to continue being taken care of in the district center by Samantha and Kadafi.

While I understand his stance, no matter how convenient, cheap, and welcoming the center would be it just wouldn't be the same.

I wanted Lily and eventually Ezekiel to go to a real pupcare where they'll be watched and taught by real, qualified people. I wanted them to have every advantage before they begin real schooling.

I want them to have a normal life for once, with herdmates they're excited to see when they wake up. That's something they can't and won't get at the center unfortunately.

I don't mean to badmouth or besmirch Samantha, Kadafi and her efforts to make our district a little more‚Ä¶ *more* have been astronomical, I don't think we or many others would've gotten this far if not for their offers to pup sit for free or their countless attempts to provide for our district. Our home and renovations to accommodate Lukas though relatively cheap, still cost a good chunk of credits. Credits that we may or may not have had to borrow and pay back soon.

Working under this district's magister may be a coveted position to the Venlil, but I'm a Farsul, working under Venlil as a glorified maid damaged my already thrice wounded pride.

I take a lot sayings from humans, then again they have a lot of sayings to take, I'll just have to *‚Äúthug it out‚Äù* as Sam seems to fond of saying

‚Äî\/\/\/‚Äî\/\/\/‚Äî\/\/\/‚Äî\/\/\/‚Äî

The station we arrive at is packed. Mostly Venlil as usual, with a few other kinds of species sprinkled in. I even see some Gojids and a pair of Kraktol. The spines' and bright colors made them very noticeable in the vast expanse of white and black wool. That and the wide berth the herd seemed to give them. My ears and tail droop a bit at the sight, my thoughts unintentionally wander over to Kadafi as Lily and I leave the station and onto the streets.


I absentmindedly rub against the cloth covering my deformed eye with my free paw. My fur stands on end and despite how much I hate it, I can't stop myself from looking around my surroundings.

*‚Äòbetter safe then sorry I guess‚Äô*

Memory transcript: **Lily Shepard, big girl**

Today was the best! Day! Ever! It was even better than when I met daddy, and that day was really, really good.

We finally got off the big tube thing, the one that goes really really fast, we entered into a big hole building that was covered in white metal and large beams that held up the ceiling. There are so many people here, mostly those fluffy white things daddy calls‚Ä¶ sheep I think. People with spiky backs, large birds like Ms. Kadafi, only these ones are blue instead of green. But I don't see any ones like me and mom.

Mama told me all about this place we're going to, that if I do go here, I'll be able to make so many new friends, I only got like one friend not including my brother.

I wish Zeke and daddy could come too, but mama says he isn't old enough, I don't know why daddy can't come. I mean I do, but it doesn't make sense. Mama told me it's because some people are really scared of him and that's also the reason why he wears that weird mask all the time whenever he leaves home

That stupid though, daddy isn't scary at all, he's so nice and sooo much fun too. He has such fun games and best of all he and Aunty are aliens from outer space, I know that mama is one to and a bunch of other people that aren't those wooly sheep things are as well, but Papa and Aunty always tell me and Zeke cool stories from his home planet and all the awesome space adventures they went on, so they're really really cool aliens.

It was actually on one of those space adventures he saved mama, I really like that story. It's my favorite.

I wonder what the teacher will be, I hope they're an alien like daddy or aunty.

I'm so excited I can barely hold it, but I do anyways, cause mommy asked me to. She was a bit mean doing it, but she said she was sorry.

We enter a really big street and there are even more people here. I've never seen this many people back at home, our streets are empty most of the time. 

Mommy's head is turning every which way as we walk, she does that sometimes when she's scared, I don't really understand why though it's really bright out as it always is. That's what I really like about living here, it's always bright out.

I wonder if all adults are scared most of the time. Then again, daddy isn't scared of anything at all and he's an adult too. He ain't even scared of the dark like mommy is. I'm scared of the dark too, that's why daddy got me and Zeke a little light at the bottoms of our beds, he says it helps to scare away any monsters in the dark cuz they're afraid of the light.

It definitely works cuz I haven't seen any monsters at all whenever it's on and the other lights aren't.

Mom finally stops before a really big building, not as big or large as that one with the metal tubes but still really big. It's bright red and has a really big sign over the door, I dont know what it says, its squiggle things are different then the one Aunty teaches us.

Mama and papa said I'll make lotsa friends here, I hope I do I'll finally get someone to share all my favorite games with other then Zeke, he is fun to play with but too young and slow sometimes.

I wonder if my future friend's daddies are as tall as mine.

2137 April 17th [Standard Human Time]

Memory transcript: **Vena Head swivel enthusiast**

I took out my pad checking once, twice, thrice as we approached the red building. 

**Little sprout's haven**. 

Its exterior popped in contrast to the rivaling buildings surrounding it. The design was meant to mimic some sort of fruit. 

*‚ÄòCute‚Äô*

The door was a bit heavy to open, even making a loud slam, I was afraid mine or Lily's tail might've been caught. This was the moment, the paranoid part of my mind felt justified and vindicated. 

But I bit my lip and beat that away, this is Lily's special day. So despite my body feeling like it'll collapse and turn to dust, I hold strong, my body stiffer than a tree.

*‚ÄòIt'll take a lot more then a door to make me break, I've faced scarier things than a door‚Äô* a small prideful snort escapes me, tail wagging. My steel composure is absolute.

‚ÄúUhh can I help you‚Äù a sudden voice laced with annoyance, coming from my blind spot snapped me out of my self centered musings

Turning so my good eye is facing the source, what befalls my sight is the form of gray wool Venlil sitting at a fairly modest desk, paws fixed on a personal holopad. He seems to be more on the older side, not elderly just older.

What was most noticeable was that sneer he was giving me, and his tail; his tail betrayed his perturbed feelings for the one before his line of sight, for all to see.

*‚ÄòFigures‚Äô* I internally sigh, *‚Äòjust when the day was going somewhat good. By the Elders I can't believe I'm even thinking this, but I'd kill for a day outside without being seen as scum.‚Äô*

‚ÄúG-good waking. My-um, my name is Vena and I was wondering-‚Äù my shaky voice unintentionally trailed off, leaving me to be interrupted by the desk Venlil

‚ÄúThe fastest way uptown is through the tubing system, which should be the 13th stop.‚Äù he says not even trying to hide the contempt dripping from each word, I open my mouth to correct and state my purpose, but again he interrupts me. ‚ÄúOr if you're looking for the spaceport it's the 27th one‚Äù he stated in a snide tone before returning his attention back to his holopad. Denying my existence, right in front of me.

That gets my ear twitching and tail curling.

I can feel a pressure in my head as anger builds up. This isn't as familiar as my usual cranial visitor. I can't quell it, but I manage to grit my teeth. 

I hate that look, I hate that look. I see it nearly every day, even from my neighbors. It seems that it follows me everywhere I go

Like with humans, I understand the herd's adverse reaction of such a‚Ä¶ revelation. Finding out former predators were living among you the whole time‚Ä¶ the crippling, the fact we Farsul were responsible for such sins

I acknowledge that what happened was horrible, despite the Farsul's prestige as a species, playing god like this was a terrible thing.

*‚ÄòIts brought us nothing but trouble, it was a mistake‚Äô*


‚ÄúNo, I'm not here inquiring about directions,‚Äù my tone hides my own disdain, I wasn't seeking confrontation. The Venlil either didn't hear me or is intentionally ignoring my and Lily's presence.

I huff, ‚Äúis Ms. Pinnu, in today? I spoke to her a few paws ago about my Lily's enrollment?‚Äù I gesture over to Lily, who perks up at the mention of her name tail wagging. Again the Venlil behind the desk refuses to answer, his only indication that he heard me is the glare he sent my way.

Lily remains oblivious to the implications of such interactions, including one such as this thankfully.

The sound of a door opening and the patter of at least two sets of paws redirects my attention from this raff. ‚ÄúThank the elders‚Äù I say under my breath. I turn to meet the new figure, praying they're at least a bit more reasonable. And what I see almost makes my heart drop.


Standing before me, is a Sivkit brownish coat, eyes greener than the grass and leaves. A Yotul, their beige fur reminds me of that coffee Samantha offered me that one time. *‚ÄòNever again‚Äô*

I've never really interacted with Sivkits in my old life or any my parents deemed not worth our concern, so I can't really tell their age or genders. I can only assume the Sivkit seems to be the older of the pair, given how they walk, though I can't be sure.


*‚ÄòA Sivkit and a Venlil, by the Elders I should've looked into this place more‚Äô*

At first glance, the sale to Freeman Spogli & Co. looked like a decent exit, $145M for a coffee chain with strong brand recognition. But when you peel back the layers, the deal exposed a familiar reality of venture capital mechanics:

* Investors got paid.
* Employees who bought into the stock program got nothing.

Why? Because of¬†**exit preferences.**¬†Venture capitalists structure their investments so that they‚Äôre first in line for payouts. Common stockholders, often employees, come last. In Philz‚Äôs case, by the time the VCs were covered, there wasn‚Äôt a penny left for staff who had put in thousands of dollars, sometimes their life savings.

Why does this matter now? Because we‚Äôre in a moment where:

* Down rounds are back. Companies that soared in 2020‚Äì21 are raising lifeline capital at lower valuations.
* Employees are once again being offered stock options in VC-backed firms, often without a full understanding of how liquidation preferences work.
* Consumer spending is shifting, just like it did post-COVID, creating more pressure on high-end, venture-backed retail and hospitality concepts.

Philz Coffee shows what happens when employees are encouraged to ‚Äúown a piece of the dream‚Äù without being told how little that piece may be worth if the company doesn‚Äôt meet VC expectations.

The lesson isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdon‚Äôt join stock programs.‚Äù It‚Äôs:

* Know your place in the payout order.
* Understand that concentrated risk (paycheck + savings tied to the same employer) can wipe you out.
* Ask hard questions about valuation, funding rounds, and exit strategies before buying in.

In a climate where exits are shaky, valuations are volatile, and layoffs are common, Philz‚Äôs story is less about coffee and more about the structural imbalance between capital and labor in venture-backed firms.

I‚Äôm now enamored, and I need advice!

**My coffee habits**  
In short, I primarily drink espressos, with an occassional americano or milk drink. These preferences are subject to change in the future, however. I tend to favor light-to-medium roasts, but will have a darker roast on occasion. I'm guessing a good lever machine will increase my appreciation for darker roasts (cf. my BBE).

**My kitchen**  
I have plenty of counter space, but the espresso machine will likely be placed under cabinets. Fortunately, my cabinets are fairly high (lowest point = 18"" above the counter; more space under the cabinet). The machine will also be placed near my fridge, which has a water hookup, so plumbing in will be quite easy. However, there's no drain line. I have a Z1, so I shouldn't be bottlenecked by my grinder.

**Machines of interest**

* The Profitec Pro 800
   * Pros:¬†Undoubtedly gorgeous and built very well and has the option to plumb in
   * Cons: Large, rather expensive, and slow heat-up (but I can use a smart plug)
* Londinium Vectis
   * Pros: Compact and affordable
   * Cons: Cannot plumb in, although Reiss told me that it may be possible for me to modify the machine to allow plumbing in for boiler refills (when not in use). I'm very interested in this‚Äî**does anyone have any idea how difficult this would be? Would it just involve drilling a hole in the boiler and installing a valve?**
* Londinium Compressa
   * Pros: Relatively compact and somewhat affordable
   * Cons: I'd need to buy the R24 drip tray to since I do not have a drain line. I've also had trouble finding reviews on this one.

**My questions**

1. I'm particularly interested in having a ""silent"" experience. From what I've read, all three of these offer this, correct?
2. I've read that the Pro 800 is better for darker roasts and the Londiniums are better for lighter to medium roasts (""water hammer""). How true is this? Has anyone compared these directly, or is the argument purely theoretical?
3. Is there anything I should know or consider when choosing between these options? Or alternatively, are there any machines I'm missing or reasons why I shouldn't get a lever?
   * Someone from Clive Coffee suggested that levers are less consistent and more finnicky, but from my reading, the opposite is true. Is there any merit to this idea?

‚ÄúDanny‚Äù  
  
I grunted, resisting the literal call of the waking world and rolling over, burying my face into the pillow. ‚ÄúDanny‚Äù The call came again, still soft, but a little more insistent. I let out a sound which, to me sounded like ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù, but in retrospect, was likely little more than a grumble. A moment later, I felt hands gently shaking my shoulder, and I reluctantly allowed them to chase away the last vestiges of sleep. ‚ÄúDanny, wake up darling, it‚Äôs almost noon!‚Äù Paula‚Äôs words caused me to open my eyes and look at the vintage alarm clock on the bedside table. She was right; according to the two hands, it was 11:43.  
  
‚ÄúAlright, alright, I‚Äôm up‚Äù I grumbled, the words actually passing from my lips as I forced myself to sit up. Paula sat on the edge of the bed next to me, already dressed in a white button up shirt and pair of slacks. A smile played over her lips as our eyes locked. ‚ÄúGood morning, Sleeping Beauty‚Äù she proclaimed, ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù I rubbed my eyes, feeling the throb from last night‚Äôs rather excessive drinking session already starting. ‚ÄúAside from the jackhammer team already going to work behind my temples, I‚Äôm great‚Äù I said sarcastically, earning a laugh from her. ‚ÄúWell, you *did* decide to go more than a little overboard with the alcohol, darling‚Äù I gave her a sly look. ‚ÄúMaybe, but you didn‚Äôt seem to mind that when we went to bed‚Äù Paula‚Äôs cheeks turned red, and she gave me a gentle push, giggling softly.  
  
I threw the covers back, sliding my feet down onto the carpeted floor. ‚ÄúAnyways, what‚Äôve you been up to while I‚Äôve been snoring away?‚Äù I asked. She gestured to the antique television which sat at the foot of the bed. ‚ÄúI slept like a log as well. After I ordered up some room service, I decided to try watching TV, see what sort of stuff Vegas has on its channels‚Äù She gave me a perplexed look, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs the weirdest thing. All they were showing were reruns of extremely old TV shows from sixty years ago or so. Although, I did enjoy this sort of neat game show that was playing called *I‚Äôve Got a Secret*. They should really bring that back‚Äù I shrugged my shoulders. ‚ÄúI guess they‚Äôre really playing up the old school angle with this hotel. Sort of a, ‚ÄúStay with us and take a step back in time‚Äù sort of thing‚Äù I allowed an annoyed look to fall over my face. ‚ÄúAlthough, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll leave a glowing review, where I was forced to use my lucky bill‚Äù  
  
When we‚Äôd checked in, it had ended up being a bit of a hassle. For whatever reason, neither of our credit cards were able to be accepted. It‚Äôd been a surprise, as we‚Äôd never had a problem using them before. And since we‚Äôd both decided not to carry cash with us on the trip, and get it out of an ATM once we‚Äôd reached the hotel, I was forced to use something rather precious to me. It was a vintage $1000 bill, one I‚Äôd bought years ago, before the prices on them on EBay went through the roof. Luckily, even though they hadn‚Äôt been circulated in a long time, they could apparently still be used as legal tender, since it was accepted by the manager. To say it was painful to hand it over, though, was an understatement. The only thing that made it somewhat bearable, however, was the amount we had to pay. Almost shockingly, it cost a fraction of what the quoted price for *The Venetian* had been. For that, I was grateful.  
  
Paula rubbed my shoulder. ‚ÄúWell, at least you bought two of them from that collector. You still have the other one at home‚Äù I gave a small smile and nodded at her. *God bless this woman for always helping me look on the bright side*. ‚ÄúWell, let me get dressed, and we‚Äôll head downstairs. I‚Äôd like to get something for brunch myself, at least a cup of coffee. Then we‚Äôll plan out what to do today. All the tickets they gave us will give us plenty to do the next two weeks‚Äù The hotel apparently hosted a nightly show called *Casino de Paris*, a sort of retro, burlesque style performance which we‚Äôd been given tickets to watch for almost the entire duration of our stay. In addition, we‚Äôd been given tickets to shows playing around the city. They were all for tribute acts though, such as one for a Frank Sinatra and friends tribute act which was playing over at another hotel and casino I‚Äôd never heard of before called *The Sands*.  
  
Paula smiled, hopping off the bed ecstatically as I stood up and walked to my suitcase. Ten minutes later, I‚Äôd finished getting dressed, slipping into a fresh t-shirt and pair of jeans, quickly brushed my teeth, and the two of us were locking our room and heading for the elevator. A fresh faced man who apparently operated the elevator controls greeted us as the doors opened and we stepped inside. ‚ÄúGoing down, sir?"" 

‚ÄúYeah, lobby please‚Äù I said, still feeling a bit hungover and sluggish. Obediently, he pressed the button, and the doors closed, the elevator shuddering slightly as our descent down to the lobby began. As the soft elevator music pierced my ears, I looked around and noticed that the man was eyeing me rather strangely. I looked down at myself. *I don‚Äôt see anything on my clothes that would warrant him looking at me like that*, I thought. Finally, he spoke. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt mind me asking, sir, are you two from the same place as the others?‚Äù  
  
The question threw me for a bit of a loop. ‚ÄúUh, what‚Äôdya mean?‚Äù I asked in return. He shrugged his shoulders. ‚ÄúNothing, sir. Just, we sometimes have guests who drop in who-‚Äú he shot me another quick look before finishing, ‚Äú-who look, well, like they‚Äôre not from around here‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, sir, that was rude of me. My curiosity just got the better of me‚Äù For a moment, I stayed silent, the awkwardness and, frankly, strangeness of the man‚Äôs question making me feel equal amounts perplexed and weirded out. But, I resolved to be polite. I shook my head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite alright‚Äù I said, letting the silence fall over us again. A particularly sharp stab of pain stabbed behind my eyes, and I closed them, reaching up and rubbing eyelids with my thumb and index finger. Blue spots exploded in the darkness behind my eyelids, and I let out a soft groan. ‚ÄúHey, do you know where the nearest place is I can get a bottle of aspirin?‚Äù I softly asked the man. He didn‚Äôt respond. My shoulders slumped, and I let out a soft sigh. ‚ÄúExcuse me, sir?‚Äù I said a little louder. I still received no reply. Feeling a little frustrated, compounded by my pounding headache, I pulled my hand away from my face and opened my eyes, ready to give him a piece of my mind.  
  
But any verbal lashing I had built up in my throat died away. The elevator was completely empty. *Wha‚Ä¶* Both Paula and the attendant had, seemingly, vanished into thin air. I twisted around, looking behind me to see nothing but wood paneling. *Okay, what the hell is going on? I know I didn‚Äôt hallucinate stepping into the elevator with my wife, or seeing the attendant*. I fought back the rapidly rising waves of confusion and worry, stepping forward and hitting the already lit up button for the lobby twice, as if my repeated jabs it would somehow spur it on quicker. But it simply continued descending, unhurried. Finally, the loud *ding* announcing its arrival to the lobby sounded, and the doors slid open.  
  
To reveal pitch blackness. The only light was what spilled out from the elevator, creating a long, rectangular glow across the floor. ‚ÄúOkay...what the actual *fuck?*‚Äù I whispered quietly. I most certainly wasn‚Äôt taking a damn step out of the elevator into the dark. Not when I had no idea what was happening. I remembered my phone, fumbling into my pocket and pulling it out. Snapping the screen open, I found the flashlight icon and hit it. Instantly, a bright white beam of light sprang forward, shooting out into the dark. I stepped as close as I dare to the open doors, and leaning out slightly, panned the light around. It bounced off the massive, empty shape of a secondary employee desk, a luggage cart piled high with suitcases in front of it. There wasn‚Äôt a soul in sight. *Is there a power outage or something?* I wondered. But no, it wouldn‚Äôt explain the absence of everyone. *Maybe there‚Äôs a solar eclipse or something happening outside, and everyone‚Äôs gone to watch it*. I pushed that idea away as well. I hadn‚Äôt heard of any eclipse coming up in the near future, and again, it wouldn‚Äôt explain why the people behind the counter and all the guests disappeared. *Not to mention where the hell Paula and the elevator guy went*.  
  
That was when the light in the elevator began to flicker. My head snapped up to look at it as it began to rapidly blink off and back on again. ‚ÄúOh, you gotta be *fucking* kidding me, *really*?!‚Äù I hissed out between gritted teeth. It was like the inevitable, predictable conclusion of a damn horror movie scene, one of the oldest tropes in the book. Swallowing hard, I looked around to see if there was anything I could snatch up to defend myself if need be. But there was nothing remotely in that category, barring if I wanted to try and rip the metal door for the elevator‚Äôs wiring system off its hinges. I felt my pulse accelerate as the light began to flicker on and off more rapidly. Every time it plunged me into complete darkness, save for my phone‚Äôs flashlight, my heart pounded in my chest like a drum. I had no idea what the hell to do; it felt as though I were in a lose-lose situation.  
  
A heavy hand suddenly fell on my shoulder, its fingers feeling as though they were cutting into my skin. I let out an involuntary shout as I attempted to twist around to see who had grabbed me, but the grip tightened, shooting a wave of pain through me, and I was thrown forward. I sailed through the air like a rag doll before crashing to the marble floor. The breath was driven from my lungs, and I let out a cut off cry of pain. Adrenaline coursed through my veins, and I rolled onto my back, sitting up as quickly as I could. I still clutched my phone in my hands, somehow having held onto it during my short flight, and aimed it back towards the still open elevator doors. I felt the blood drain from my face as the beam landed on a figure.  
  
  
It was dressed in all black, not an inch of skin exposed. All except for its eyes. It was as if whoever I was staring at had a ski mask pulled over their face, made of a material I‚Äôd never seen before. Holes had been made around the eyes, and the ones that stared back at me were clearly human. Except no eyes I‚Äôd ever seen had ever had that much sadistic glee in them before. The figure stepped out of the elevator, and a pang of absolute terror coursed through me as I saw they were holding a fire axe in their right hand. One which already had blood on its blade and handle. *Oh, hell in a handbasket‚Ä¶* I scrambled to my feet, attempting to put as much distance between myself and the axe wielding figure.

  
Then the elevator doors closed, plunging the lobby, save for my phone‚Äôs tiny flashlight, into utter blackness.   
  
My heart felt as though it were about to explode out of my chest as I saw the figure take another step towards me. It was slow, deliberate. Almost as if they were trying to anticipate my next move. I quickly looked around, making sure to keep the menacing shape in my peripheral vision as I searched for somewhere to go. I knew the second I made a break for it, the figure would make a lunge for me. I couldn‚Äôt explain *how* I knew, but I could simply tell they were waiting for me to make the first move. And whoever it was, was *relishing* the tense moments in between. An idea suddenly surged forward in my brain. One which, if I didn‚Äôt time it perfectly, would likely wind up with me pulling a Dick Halloran and end up with an axe in my stomach. Or my head. I tensed up every muscle in my body, looking towards the left as though I were about to run towards the entrance hallway. I saw the figure also tense up, now holding the axe with both hands.  
  
I suddenly put all force into my legs, using the floor almost as a springboard. Years of track and field instinct kicked in, and I feigned to the left. Instantly, the figure was a blur of motion, raising the axe and dashing silently towards me. I turned and shot backwards, forced to turn the light away from my attacker as I made my leap. Behind me, I could practically *feel* the air being parted by the axe, and a second after beginning my leap, heard it smash into the marble floor where I‚Äôd been standing not a second ago. But I was sailing through the air, praying I‚Äôd calculated correctly. To my relief, I saw the edge of the desk pass under me, and I landed on the floor behind it. From the other side, I finally heard the figure let out a sound. ‚ÄúGah!‚Äù It sounded like a cry of frustration and rage, and it motivated me to leap to my feet faster than I thought possible. I flashed the light around, catching the heart stopping view of the shape running towards the desk, raising the axe over its head. I didn‚Äôt wait to see what happened next; Instead, I ran for the open partition which separated the employee area from the rest of the lobby. Behind me, I heard the figure vault over the counter, landing with a heavy *thud* on the floor.  
   
But I‚Äôd already ran from behind it. I knew I couldn‚Äôt make it to the entrance lobby, and instead, I aimed for the first door my light caught in its beam. It was a silver metal door marked *Employees Only!* A moment later, I smashed into it with my shoulder, the door crashing into the wall with a massive *bang*. Behind me, I heard the pounding footsteps of my pursuer, and without knowing where I was going, I ran. I‚Äôd wound up in some sort of employee hallway, likely one of many which wound their way through the hotel and casino. A rack of sheets flew by in a blur, and I came to a T junction, opting to turn right. I heard the door to the lobby smash open as the figure entered the hallway, and I used the sound as motivation to run faster, despite the fire that already burned in my legs. A few seconds later, I came to another T junction, this one seemingly identical to the last. I chose to run to the left this time, but as I did, something I saw for a split second caught my eye.  
  
It was a security camera, one which had been aimed down the hallway in the direction I‚Äôd come. I didn‚Äôt have much time to see all the details on it, as I was too busy running for my life. But, there‚Äôd been enough time to notice one. The red, blinking light showing it was recording had flashed out into the darkness.  
  
The realization flew away from my brain, as I was too preoccupied with staying a hallway or two ahead of my pursuer. I could still hear them behind me; the thundering of their footsteps drowned mine out entirely. Ahead of me, I saw another metal door, this one with no lettering on it. The hallway broke off to the left and right, but I‚Äôd already decided I was going through the door. With any luck, I‚Äôd find a place I could hide, allowing the figure to assume I‚Äôd kept running and rush past. It would give me not only a chance to catch my rapidly dwindling breath, but also double back and find the door I‚Äôd entered the back hallways to. From there, I could run to the entrance. My plan set, I poured on all the power I had remaining in me, the door flying up to greet me. I lowered my shoulder and smashed into it, flying into the room-  
  
-Where I slammed into something which knocked me backwards, halfway back into the hallway. I let out a grunt of pain as I landed on my ass, the stabbing feeling traveling up my tailbone and spine. I snapped my phone up, aiming the flashlight into the room to see what I‚Äôd slammed into. And I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I tell you my heart *stopped*. My breath caught in my throat, and I felt a tidal wave of abject horror flood into every fiber of my being.  
  
The beam had caught the figure of a person, standing less than a foot or two away from where I lay in a crumpled heap on the floor. One dressed *identical* to the one which had been chasing me. Like the other, this one carried an axe, though this one had no blood on it. I twisted around, wondering if my pursuer had shot down an alternate corridor to get ahead of me. But, no. I could both hear and now see them running down the hallway towards me. Towards us. I spun back towards the newcomer. And felt, if possible, an even greater spike of horror shoot through me. The figure wasn‚Äôt alone in the room beyond. A second had moved into the beam of the light. It was joined by a third. Then a fourth and fifth. In the span of ten seconds, the light showed at least seven or eight figures in the room. Behind me, I heard my pursuer slow to a walk.  
  
I began to scramble backwards on my hands and knees, towards the right branch of the hallway. The figures from the room followed, spilling out in slow, silent pursuit. They met my pursuer there, where they stood, still silently watching me scramble away. Then, they began to laugh. Men‚Äôs laughter, but filled with absolute evil and malice. They stopped, going silent once more, and slowly began to advance on me. My scrambling intensified, and in my hasty retreat, I forgot to watch where I was going. I felt something slam into the back of my head, while simultaneously, something sharp jabbed into my left arm. The arm which had been holding my phone.  
  
Reflexively, I dropped it as I jerked my arm back. It clattered to the floor, the beam of light aiming up at the ceiling. I looked behind me and saw I‚Äôd backed into another linen rack. The stabbing sensation had been a sharp edge which had pierced the skin. I twisted back around to see how close the figures had gotten.  
  
And I let out a half scream. All of the figures stood over me. They‚Äôd used my moment of distraction to get in close, cutting off any way for me to escape. My breathing came in short, ragged gasps as I realized what was about to happen. As if they‚Äôd read my mind, all of them began raising their axes. The almost maddening sound of their laughter returned as they held them high over their heads. My life suddenly flashed before my eyes, snapshots of being a young child, a teenager, turning eighteen, meeting Paula. Then, a single, clear thought:  
  
*Oh, fuck, this is gonna hurt*.  
  
I raised my arms in front of my face in some pathetic attempt to ward off the multiple blades about to cut me to ribbons. The blades whipped down, and I closed my eyes, letting out one last scream in defiance of my fate.  
  
‚ÄúDanny!‚Äù  
	  
The voice cut through the sudden silence. One which was only broken by soft sound of‚Ä¶*elevator music?* Realizing I wasn‚Äôt feeling the piercing pain from multiple axe blades, I slowly lowered my arms and opened my eyes. Paula and the elevator operator knelt by my side. The man had a look of concern on his face; on Paula's, panic. I became aware I was back in the elevator. And that I was laying on the floor. For a moment, I couldn‚Äôt find the words to speak. Then: ‚ÄúW-what happened?‚Äù Paula let out a huge sigh of relief that I‚Äôd answered. ‚ÄúWe had a moment where the elevator went offline for a moment. It went black for a few seconds. I don't know what happened, if you fell asleep standing up during it, but right before the power came back on, you suddenly began‚Ä¶.screaming‚Äù Her voice trailed off, and I realized just how frightened my wife was.   
  
But I was still attempting to make sense of it all. *But it felt‚Ä¶it felt so real*, I thought to myself. *The blackout, the figures pursuing me. The pain. It felt‚Ä¶real*. My mind seemed to race at a million miles an hour. The elevator attendant spoke up. ‚ÄúDid you get a decent night‚Äôs sleep, sir?‚Äù he asked with a tone of concern. For a moment, I debated on my answer, then, decided to speak truthfully. ‚ÄúHonestly‚Ä¶no‚Äù I said weakly, ‚ÄúMy wife and I‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt get much sleep. And‚Ä¶I drank a lot‚Äù The man nodded, a relieved smile crossing his face. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I figured. Sleep deprivation, combined with the large amount of alcohol will cause you to fall asleep for short periods of time, and experience horrifying dreams‚Äù He reached down and grabbed my arm, pulling me to my feet. ‚ÄúMy older brother‚Äôs a doctor, is how I know about that‚Äù he explained.  
  
I felt Paula grab my arm to help steady me as I mulled the man‚Äôs words over in my head. They made sense. *A lot more sense then, what? Suddenly appearing in some alternate reality where everyone had disappeared, everything was black, and figures with axes were chasing you?* I nodded, trying to push away a small voice in the back of my head that attempted to argue that, despite the man‚Äôs words and the rationalizations my brain was attempting to make, it had been real. But after a moment, it seemed the rational part of my brain won out. I pushed away the nagging voice and attempted to compose myself. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre alright, darling?‚Äù Paula asked me, her voice soft and low. I looked at her, then nodded my head after a moment. ‚ÄúYeah, yeah I‚Äôm okay‚Äù I let out a deep breath. ‚ÄúI guess the incident that happened in the parking lot last night is still in the back of my mind is all‚Äù  
  
She nodded understandingly. ‚ÄúThat makes sense‚Äù she said, then smiled and leaned forward to kiss me. ‚ÄúJust, please, don‚Äôt scare me like that again‚Äù I allowed myself a small smile and pulled her close to me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try not to‚Äù. A moment later, the elevator let out a soft *ding* and the doors opened, revealing the brightly lit and bustling lobby. I turned to Paula. ‚ÄúGo ahead for a second, sweetheart‚Äù I told her quietly, ‚ÄúI wanna tip the attendant for helping us‚Äù For a moment, she seemed concerned leaving me alone, then nodded, stepping out of the elevator. I turned back to the man, pulling my wallet from my back pocket. ‚ÄúLook sir, I‚Äôd like to give you something for your troubles with me‚Äù I said as I rifled through the massive amount of bills which now filled it. The man began to protest, but I held up a hand. ‚ÄúI insist. It‚Äôs my way of saying thank you‚Äù He looked as though he wanted to try and protest again, but instead, he stayed silent and nodded.  
  
I finally decided on giving him a fifty; with inflation being the way it was, everyone could use a helping, generous hand every now and then. I pulled it from my wallet and pushed the bill into his hand. For a moment, he stared down at it, and I saw an almost stunned look pass over his face. It was as if I‚Äôd handed him a solid gold bar. *Wow, other guests must not tip these people that hot if he has this much of a reaction to just fifty bucks*. Mentally shaking my head at how sad that possibility was, I nodded to him and stepped out of the elevator, replacing my wallet in my pocket. I turned back to look at him one final time before the elevator closed. And involuntarily took a step backwards. The man had fixed an odd and rather intense gaze on me, one which was unblinking. It was more than a little eerie.  
  
Mercifully, though, the elevator doors closed. I let out a bewildered snort and turned away. *I‚Äôve gotta post a tweet about that odd encounter*, I thought, and reached into my pocket for my phone. But it wasn‚Äôt there. ‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I muttered, checking my other pockets. I knew for a fact I‚Äôd grabbed it before we‚Äôd left the room. In fact, I‚Äôd even said something about it to Paula. ‚ÄúWait a minute, honey. I‚Äôm not leaving my phone after charging it all night‚Äù. I replayed getting up from the floor of the elevator in my mind. Had I seen it dropped when I stared down at my feet for a moment? No, I hadn‚Äôt. I raised my left hand to scratch at the back of my scalp, a coping mechanism for stress I‚Äôd had since I was a child. A sudden, stabbing pain coursed through my arm, causing me to let out a bit of a gasp. Lowering my arm quickly, I brought my other hand around to feel the back of it. Another ripple of pain emanated from the area, and I pulled my fingers back to see small droplets of blood.  
  
‚ÄúThe hell did that happen?‚Äù I muttered quietly to myself. The memory of the waking nightmare suddenly flashed through my mind. I remembered scrambling back, straight into the linen rack which had stabbed into my left arm‚Ä¶exactly where the wound was. A shiver suddenly shot up my spine. *It‚Ä¶was just a nightmare‚Ä¶a dream‚Ä¶.wasn‚Äôt it?* I shook my head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a coincidence, you moron‚Äù I muttered, ‚ÄúYou hurt yourself in the elevator, that‚Äôs all. Get a damn grip and stop going mental on me‚Äù Shaking away the nagging thought, I stepped forward to rejoin my wife. Together, we walked the length of the lobby until we reached the main area and approached the check-in counter. The same man as last night, whose name, according to the nametag pinned to his chest was Arthur, spotted us and smiled wide. ‚ÄúAh, good morning to the two newlywed lovebirds!‚Äù he exclaimed, holding out his arms in a similar manner to how he had last night, ‚ÄúHow did you two sleep?‚Äù Paula let out a snort. ‚ÄúWe slept okay, but I think *this one*-‚Äú she gestured to me, ‚Äúis going to lay off the alcohol the rest of the honeymoon!‚Äù The man- Arthur, let out a good natured laugh. ‚ÄúWell, I can‚Äôt fault him, the first few weeks after being married are always a joyous occasion. But, sometimes you can overdo it‚Äù  
  
I let out a snort. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not kidding‚Äù I grumbled. Paula turned to give me an amused look, then looked back at Arthur. ‚ÄúDo you have any place that serves coffee and either a late breakfast or lunch here? I‚Äôd like to get some food and caffeine into him‚Äù Arthur let out another good natured chuckle, then gestured to the front hallway. ‚ÄúOf course. Unfortunately, we stopped serving breakfast at eleven, but if you‚Äôd like lunch, our fabulous restaurant, *Dome of the Sea*, is just outside; a short walk across the parking lot‚Äù He leaned forward, ‚ÄúAnd between you two and me, their lunch menu is to die for‚Äù He let out another laugh, causing both of us to chuckle at the man‚Äôs cheesy pun. I nodded. ‚ÄúAlright, thank you, Arthur‚Äù I said. He raised his hands. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it; it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm here for!‚Äù He cleared his throat as we turned away. ‚ÄúBy the way, there‚Äôs a special show happening tonight, taking the place of *Casino de Paris*. It‚Äôs called *La Parisienne*, direct from France, and there‚Äôs going to be a special guest in it tonight‚Äù  

He looked around, then grinned at us. 

‚ÄúHave either of you heard of a singer and actress named Diana Dors?‚Äù I looked to Paula and shrugged, my mind drawing a blank. She returned the gesture. ‚ÄúNo, unfortunately not‚Äù I admitted, turning back to the man. He gave a shocked look. ‚ÄúWell, then you‚Äôre in for a treat. Just use two of your tickets for the other show, they‚Äôll be valid for this. And just *wait* until you hear the pipes this dame has on her. I‚Äôm just happy she chose our stage to perform‚Äù I looked to Paula and gave an interested look. She nodded. ‚ÄúSure, thanks for the heads up, we‚Äôll check it out!‚Äù I declared, then rubbed my pounding temples, ‚ÄúAfter I get coffee and food‚Äù He laughed, then waved us away. ‚ÄúHave a lovely day, you two!‚Äù  
  
The two of us strode outside into the hot, arid air. As we left the shade of the entrance, I shot a look up. A large statue of what looked to be an Arabic sultan stood atop the entrance area, the yellow letters spelling out *Dunes* stretching to either side. *One hell of a mascot*. As we approached the entrance to the restaurant, a huge, circular building, something caught my eye. It was an old newspaper vending machine, the kind with an all glass case. *Holy shit, I haven‚Äôt seen one of those newspaper machines in years! I thought they stopped using them*. I stopped Paula for a second to drop a quarter into the machine and opened it, pulling a newspaper out and tucking it under my arm. I‚Äôd read it inside. ‚ÄúWhat, trying to act all sophisticated and old school to match the hotel, darling?‚Äù my wife asked with an amused smile. I laughed, then gently pushed her forward and through the double doors.  
  
The inside of the restaurant was, to use a single word, opulent. It lived up to its name, done up in an aquatic theme, with an ornate, dark blue roof stretching out overhead. Water filled, grotto like areas stood around the tables, and surprisingly, a live band played in one corner. As we were led to our table, I noticed something which threw me for a bit of a loop. All of the people having lunch were done up to the nines. The men wore suits, looking like they‚Äôd just come from a power meeting, and the women wore very fancy looking dresses. That wasn‚Äôt the only surprising part. All the suits and dresses looked, to put a word on it, extremely vintage. Even the younger patrons, ones about our age, were dressed that way. They all seemed to stare at us as we passed, as if we‚Äôd each grown an additional head. *Okay, that‚Äôs honestly a bit weird, but whatever*.  
  
I put it out of my mind as we sat down and ordered our meals. The coffee was brought to me immediately, and the hot liquid tasted like a godsend. It almost made me forget about the horrifying experience in the elevator, as well as my lost phone and injured arm, both which I couldn‚Äôt honestly explain, and instead kept mentally pushing away. The positive atmosphere and calming music seemed to help. I set the mug down and picked up the newspaper from the table. ‚ÄúSo, what do you want to do for the rest of the day until tonight?‚Äù I asked Paula as I turned the front page towards me. ‚ÄúWell, I was thinking we could take a drive up and down the strip, get a feel for all the casinos and restaurants. Then we could find a place to maybe stop and play a few slots- I know, you always told me they‚Äôre rigged, but I‚Äôd still like to try them at least once. Oh, and then, if we have time-‚Äú  
  
She continued on, but I wasn‚Äôt listening anymore. Every sound in the restaurant seemed to lower, as if someone with a television remote had hit the volume button. I swear I could hear the blood rushing through my head as I felt my mouth go dry as cotton. My heart began to beat almost as fast as it had in my chase, real or imaginary, and it felt as though the world were beginning to spin. I kept staring at the front page of the paper, at the picture on the front of it. And at something else.  
  
Finally, a sound cut through the seemingly muted noises. ‚ÄúDanny, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Paula asked, reaching out and taking my free hand in hers. I lowered the newspaper and stared at her. My face must‚Äôve been pale as a sheet, because I saw extreme concern crease her beautiful features. ‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù she insisted. It took a moment to find my voice. ‚ÄúUh, Paula, sweetheart?‚Äù I said weakly, ‚ÄúWe, uh‚Ä¶we might have a problem‚Äù Silence for a moment. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked, then looked at the paper. I saw her put two and two together. ‚ÄúWhat did you read?‚Äù she finally asked, slowly.  
   
I set the paper down in the center of the table, turning it so she could read it properly. I saw her lean in and mouth the words as she read. I saw her expression change, from concern to utter shock. She snapped her head up to look at me, as if to search my eyes for an explanation she desperately needed. But I had none to give.  
  
The picture on the front of the page, was of John F. Kennedy. I can‚Äôt remember the exact headline, though I know it contained the words ‚ÄúPresident Kennedy‚Äù. But even now, I can still perfectly recall the date displayed under the newspaper‚Äôs name.

And now, to make herself feel better, she constantly makes jabs about my lack of romantic experience.","We know each other from high school. We went to an all girls high school which really didn't help matters. And when college hit, the pandemic was going on. We're both in our early/mid twenties now.

Anyway, a little less than a year and a half ago, she met this guy at her job. They were just friends at first but she grew to have feelings for him. Two of them would often go to the mall together. It usually ended with them making out in his car. She would tell me things about him that just kind of seemed sketch. The most divert example I can think of is when she was texting him about getting iced coffee during the week. He texted back ""I'll give you something to put in your mouth"". She even pushed back slightly. She said ask her out on a date first. He said ""what do you think our hangouts in the past have been then?"" Referring to the times they went to the mall or for coffee.

One day, they go to the mall together. And she ends up losing her virginity to him in his car. And he ghosted her only a week later. She was devastated. But she started making a little comments about me. She would say stuff like ""we should go to a bar/party/club so you can finally have your first kiss"". She has at least three different iterations of that sentence. Look, I know why she's doing it.

She's doing it because she's so insanely insecure about having her first time with the guy it clearly didn't care about her. Even though all the signs were there. I'm not necessarily sad that she has a friend said this. Honestly, if she says that to me again, I won't hesitate to just ghost her. Throw her away. And yes, maybe it is a bit dramatic.

1nqqo5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1nqqo5g/beans_grinder_absolutely_does_the_brewer_really/,"Beans, grinder absolutely - does the brewer really matter?","
I've been focusing on making coffee instead of posting the last few months. 

I've been brewing beans from RogueWave with Hario Switch and DF54 or Olido OG. The cups have been really good to awesome. Decent definition, juicy. Or, I can get sweeter, more texured cups by  steeping 20 seconds longer.

But, I ordered the SworksDesign bottomless brewer a couple of days to add to the collection. This wa my first  submission to G A.S. in 5 months but I already have buyers remorse. 

Not because I think there will be issues with the brewer  No,  because I dusted off my Kalita Tsuebami today and did a free-hand,  low agitation, 3 pour cup using the same RogueWave beans.  This cup was also awesome - slightly different but still similar to the cup produced with the Switch and every bit as good.

I suspect that I will discover the same with the SWorks brewer.

Point being, as has been said here many times, money in this hobby is best spent first on quality beans, then a good grinder. T

THEN pick a brewer/dripper. Any brewer  Maybe the one that looks the coolest. Learn how to use it. Try different pouring techniques, etc.

Collecting gear is cool but it can and did interfere with my progress in learning how to make great coffee simply because I was always chasing the latest, shiny dripper instead of buying good beans and leaning how to master the equipment I already owned 

Knowing this is one thing. Having the discipline to focus on coffees and mastering a brewer isn't easy with all the YT influencers and Reddit users creating FOMO and G A S.

So,  SWorks is the last brewer I'm buying ever. 

Well, except maybe the Oxo Rapid Brewer  Damn, that looks interesting. 

Seriously, you do you. Trying gear IS fun.  No judging here.

Main Characters:

¬∑ Ryan: Approximately 1.7m tall, male, wears a dark blue fur-collared coat. He has a calm and low-key personality. He holds a certain status and manages the Drylan area (a ""shantytown"" under a large bridge). Sometimes he dispatches people on missions. He has grudges against the Black Valley Group.

¬∑ Gree: Approximately 1.75m tall, a robot with a human consciousness. He illegally copied and transferred his memories into the machine, losing his original body. His robot form is rather thin, with a head resembling a small TV screen that displays floating yellow circles instead of expressions. The robot's color is ochre yellow. Gree is open and does not hide his emotions. He works for Ryan.

¬∑ DK (1.1): Approximately 1.75m tall, a pure robot. Apart from his white, ethereal round eyes, his entire appearance is black: black bowler hat, black coat, black pants, black shoes. He is equipped with an electric pistol. DK is an enforcement robot from the Black Valley Group, tasked with capturing criminals. However, after Gree installs an ""Emotion Editor"" (a program that allows emotionless robots to compute and understand human-like emotions), his life path changes completely.

¬∑ Jello: Approximately 1.8m tall, male, with a spiky haircut and a black high-collared coat. He is serious, unsmiling, and somewhat impatient. He also works with Ryan, having joined him out of hatred because his brother was taken away by Black Valley.

¬∑ Kilo: Approximately 1.7m tall, the president of the Black Valley Group. He sports a center-part hairstyle and often wears suits. Under his leadership, Black Valley expanded, creating more flexible robots (like DK) and the new generation of hover vehicles (named Karex). Behind this glamorous facade, Kilo is also developing secret projects.

¬∑ Khaos: Appears briefly in this chapter but sets up a major future plot point. A young man who is unfortunately killed by DK by mistake during a conflict.

¬∑ Black Creature: A product of Kilo's secret projects. It resembles a dense black gas but has weight. It can parasitize hosts, similar to Venom. This entity has existed since decades ago, reportedly originating from a first experiment over 40 years ago where four researchers were exposed, each gaining different supernatural abilities. The black creature was born from this, but only its first host (one of the four researchers) could control it. After that person's death, no one else could master it, and all subsequent volunteers who allowed it to parasitize them went insane. Black Valley was forced to contain it.

¬∑ Redstone: A small stone emitting red light, containing energy. It is a key element throughout the Light of Star story. Black Valley uses it for experiments and weapons.
¬∑ Black Valley Group: A major corporation in the era. Black Valley researches and improves many technologies, runs multiple projects, including clandestine ones.

Chapter 1 Summary:
The year is 2086. Ryan and Gree plan to steal the new Karex technology from Black Valley, as it's classified and not publicly released. Ryan wants to use this tech to build his own Karex. Gree uses his criminal record to lure an enforcement robot, DK, and installs his own ""Emotion Editor"" into DK's slot, erasing his previous memories. Gree intends to use DK's identity to help infiltrate the Black Valley building. After Ryan confirms the plan, the operation begins. During the mission, they encounter Jello, who was also dispatched by Ryan, though they don't know each other yet. DK and Gree cause chaos, leading to a gunfight where DK accidentally injures a bystander ‚Äì Kilo's son. After breaking through, DK and Gree escape with valuable data. Upon returning to Ryan, they formally meet Jello. However, due to the death of Kilo's son, Black Valley forces soon track them down. Jello barely escapes, while Ryan, Gree, and DK are captured. Kilo meets them, planning to use Ryan as experimental material and scrap DK and Gree. However, Jello quickly arrives to rescue them. During the process, Jello unfortunately becomes parasitized by the black creature. Before losing his sanity, Jello helps his comrades defeat numerous enemies and break out. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the enemy retreats. Jello asks Ryan to kill him to prevent him from harming his friends. Jello sacrifices himself, and the other three escape.

Chapter 2 Summary:

New Characters & Info:

¬∑ Lucy & Gilco: A female-male duo with advanced gear who fight together. Lucy is a female character, her sci-fi medical equipment making her look robotic, but she is human. Over 1.7m tall, with two long braids. She is impulsive and somewhat reckless, but reliable when serious. Gilco is a male character, approximately 1.8m tall, also with sci-fi equipment. He is earnest and calm. Although both come from the upper echelons, they are aware of the shady methods used by the authorities and Black Valley.

¬∑ Bruno: Approximately 1.75m tall, male, slender build, slightly yellowish skin. He often wears equipment he built himself to aid his mobility due to his poor health, making him look somewhat monstrous. He is Ryan's childhood friend and became family after Ryan married his sister. He loves inventing and often creates interesting gadgets. With the obtained Karex tech, Bruno will help build a Karex for Drylan.

¬∑ DK (1.2): After his black round face was shattered in the previous fight, Bruno builds DK a new face ‚Äì more angular and sharp-looking instead of the previous round, ethereal one. DK's personality has also matured; he is composed, thoughtful, and cares for those around him.

¬∑ Glare: A robot, approximately 2m tall, Black Valley's trump card. He wears a cloak black outside and red inside. His mechanical body is very streamlined and compact. His steering-wheel-sized hands have claws. More intimidating are his pupils: large black eyeballs with yellow irises, appearing icy and terrifying. His strength matches his appearance.

¬∑ Khaos: Approximately 1.8m tall, looks like a large doll. Entire body is white with gold accents. His white face has red, egg-like eyes without distinct pupils, made of a material similar to tempered glass. His weapon is a gold cane concealing a hidden gun. His appearance exudes luxury. He is actually Kilo's deceased son. To save him, Kilo had to give him this new body and abilities, subjecting him to Redstone experiments. Khaos now has the ability to shift to and from another dimension. However, this ability has a flaw: any living beings taken into the other space must all be brought back alive. If one dies inside and is left behind when exiting, the other dimension will collapse, including Khaos himself.

Plot Summary:
The story opens with Lucy and Gilco confronting Khaos, but they are defeated. Gilco sacrifices himself, and Lucy escapes.
Unaware of this, Ryan sends Gree and DK to negotiate cooperation with Lucy and Gilco. They don't know about Gilco's death yet. Upon meeting Lucy, she captures them, blaming them for Gilco's death because DK killed Kilo's son, leading to Khaos's creation. After persuasion by DK and Gree, the three eventually reach an understanding.
Later, Lucy is betrayed and deceived by a friend, falling into a trap set by Kilo, who dispatches Glare. During the battle, Gree sacrifices himself to protect DK, getting crushed by Glare. Fortunately, Ryan arrives in the newly built Drylan Karex, created with Bruno, and manages to shake off Glare. However, during the escape, several Black Valley Karex vehicles pursue them. While Ryan is driving, an enemy from one of the pursuing Karex shoots through the windshield, killing Ryan.
In the final battle between DK, Lucy, and Khaos, Lucy discovers a flaw in Khaos's ability and sacrifices herself, trapping Khaos forever in his own dimension. Only DK survives out of the four.
Later, when DK goes to Bruno for repairs, he learns from Bruno that Ryan had secretly built a resistance army in Drylan to fight against the authorities and Black Valley.
DK's main story concludes here.

Ryan Spinoff

Main Characters & Info:

¬∑ Ryan: At 20, Ryan is youthful, introverted, but also stubborn and perseverant. Though he has few friends, he cherishes those around him.

¬∑ Bruno: In his youth, Bruno also loved inventing. He's Ryan's best friend, gentle, easy-going, and caring.

¬∑ Newa: Bruno's sister. She is sharp-tongued, openly criticizing anything displeasing. She is also very beautiful, which is part of why Ryan falls for her, though not solely for her looks.

¬∑ Utor: Approximately 1.8m tall, male, middle-aged but doesn't appear mature. Wears a brown coat, half-finger gloves, a cool mask, and brass knuckles on his belt. His weapon is a simple yellow compound bow. He has a seemingly frivolous personality, speaking bluntly, which makes many people dislike him. However, he is not worldly and dislikes worldly things and people. He sees through things clearly and never engages in meaningless conflicts. He is always calm but acts foolish. Utor secretly founded a group in the city for the homeless to gather and have a place of their own.

¬∑ Foster Father Pastor: Ryan's foster father, elderly, gentle, and considerate. He cares deeply for Ryan and often takes him to church.

¬∑ Ryan's Father: Ryan's biological father. When Ryan was eight, his father abandoned the family for money and power, and accidentally killed Ryan's mother. Ryan secretly witnessed this, but his father was unaware and fled. Ryan was subsequently adopted by the pastor. Ryan continues to investigate his father.

Plot Summary:
The timeline goes back to 2055. Ryan is 20, living with his foster father, the pastor. On his 20th birthday, Ryan, Bruno, and Newa drink heavily, leading to Ryan falling asleep on the street on his way home. He wakes up to find his phone and wallet stolen. With Bruno and Newa's help, they track the items to Utor's place. Ryan feels that although Utor leads a group of small-time troublemakers, he is someone worth befriending, and they get acquainted.
Later, Ryan discovers clues about his father, who is doing shady work for Black Valley for large sums of money, even using it later to gain control over Drylan's management‚Äîessentially like a gang leader. He claims this was to find his son, Ryan, and tries to recruit him. Remembering his mother's death, Ryan refuses and seeks out Utor. Utor agrees to help Ryan. Through his adventures with Utor, Ryan learns and understands many things, though he still struggles somewhat to accept Utor's personality.
In the end, Ryan defeats his father and dons his dark blue fur-collared coat, becoming the new manager of Drylan. Utor tells Ryan he is leaving to find an old friend and disappears from the city just before Christmas.

Light of Star III

Main Characters & Info:

¬∑ Cassie: Approximately 1.75m tall, female, long braids, brown skin, wears a large white eyepatch. Casual white crop top and white tight pants show off her slender figure. While she doesn't always have strong opinions, she is brave and loyal. She has a small flying saucer-like hover robot named ZOE, created by Bruno, that accompanies her. It can hover and has strong load-bearing capacity; while not strong offensively, it's practical for support.

¬∑ Fey: Approximately 1.75m tall, female, undercut short hair, wears red-lensed round goggles and a large black face mask. Often wears black punk-style clothing, sometimes colorful outfits. Fey is Cassie's close friend; they met during the resistance war. Her weapon is a sniper rifle. She is serious, meticulous, and finds it hard to open up to strangers.

¬∑ Joel: Approximately 1.8m tall, male, brown hair, wears a brown coat. He is Ryan's biological son. After Ryan's death, he lives with his uncle, Bruno, and helps him with tasks. His identity as Ryan's son is hidden after the resistance war begins. During this time, Joel hones his skills and creates his own weapon: a pair of heavy iron gauntlets with claws and retractable short blades at the bottom. Joel has a close relationship with Cassie.

¬∑ Redshade Vridian: Approximately 1.85m tall, male. A large white wide-brimmed hat with a small red flower. Gold-framed, red-lensed glasses and an ivory-white mask give him a mysterious air. He wears a green frock coat, with a shotgun pistol and a long knife at his waist. He enjoys smoking and 20th-century art styles. He is an agent of the Black Valley Guard, but later betrays them. The higher-ups notice this, and after the war, Black Valley disposes of and abandons him.

¬∑ Infrared: Approximately 1.8m tall, wears a gray-red parka, a red gas mask that looks authoritative. Armed with two pistols. He is also a Black Valley Guard agent, working for Black Valley even before the war. He was once Redshade Vridian's partner. But due to Redshade's change, their partnership became a memory. Infrared is taciturn, never speaking unnecessarily. He led the Guard to many victories, but this seems to have left him with guilt.

¬∑ Khaos: For certain reasons, Khaos returns. Previously trapped in his own dimension after Lucy died there, he now uses the power of the Redstone to return. The cost is his sanity. He consumes the Redstone, making him more powerful. His body becomes taller and bulkier. His previous red round eyes become red lightning-shaped. The gold accents are gone; he is now a frenzied ""beast.""

¬∑ Frank: Approximately 1.8m tall, an experiment subject of Black Valley. His body is decrepit compared to Khaos's. He also has red eyes. His body is composed of black and green, and he only has his left arm; his right arm is amputated. He possesses the same ability as Khaos, and they share the same other dimension, which becomes key to defeating Khaos later. After Black Valley's lab building was destroyed during the resistance war, Frank and others moved to a fortress outside the city, unknown to most. Although an experiment subject, Frank remains unyielding to Black Valley.

Plot Summary:
In 2088, the resistance army founded by Ryan officially launches a rebellion against Black Valley. Black Valley, having provided the authorities with weapons derived from experiments, receives military aid from them, known as the Guard. The Guard has superior equipment and numbers. By 2090, the resistance fails, and all participants are confined to Drylan. During the war, the city changes drastically; many districts are now ruins, including the destroyed Black Valley lab. The bridge above Drylan is destroyed. Although sunlight now reaches Drylan, it looks more like a slum.
In 2090, after the failed war, Cassie and Fey sneak into the destroyed Black Valley lab to scavenge. They accidentally find a buried Redstone and a small USB drive. The Redstone is thumb-sized, protected by a device. They return to Bruno and give him the Redstone. Meanwhile, while searching for materials in a scrapyard, Bruno and Joel find the barely alive Redshade Vridian lying in the ruins. Fey distrusts him initially due to his Guard background, despite his explanations.
Later that night, driven by curiosity, Bruno opens the device protecting the Redstone. Simultaneously, Khaos is attracted by the Redstone, using its opened state as a breach to regain freedom, now insane. He kills Bruno.
The next day, Joel and the others discover this scene with anger and confusion. Bruno is dead, and the Redstone is gone. Joel vows to find the perpetrator. Fey uses the USB drive, finding coordinates to Black Valley's new fortress base. They go there, encounter Frank, and help him escape. During this, they meet Infrared, sent to stop them. They manage to escape with minimal casualties. Infrared learns that Redshade Vridian is alive. Meanwhile, Cassie's group learns about Khaos from Frank. Frank warns them against confronting Khaos, but they recognize the future threat he poses. Cassie's group are the best candidates to stop him now. Frank agrees to assist but won't fight.
Later, they encounter Infrared again. Redshade Vridian tells the others to go ahead, facing Infrared alone. Infrared is under orders to eliminate them, especially the traitor Redshade. During the fight, Infrared is defeated. Redshade knows Infrared could have easily beaten him. At the last moment, Infrared hesitates before firing. Seizing the opportunity, Redshade shoots Infrared in the chest. As Infrared falls, Redshade feels complex emotions and runs to him. Infrared, dying, gives Redshade something before passing away.
Elsewhere, Cassie, Fey, Joel, and Frank confront Khaos. They eventually defeat him using a clever method, but it's a pyrrhic victory; Joel also sacrifices himself.
Now a lone wolf, Redshade Vridian goes to Black Valley headquarters and kills Kilo.
Khaos is defeated, Kilo is dead, and the Redstone disappears from the world.

Light of Star I

Main Characters:

¬∑ Uto: Approximately 1.8m tall, wears a mask and a camel-colored parka. His weapon is a simple compound bow. Uto has a twisted sense of humor, giving him a unique charm. Some think he's a fool, others find him worth befriending.

¬∑ Dex: Approximately 1.8m tall, Uto's close friend. Wears a purple gothic coat, giving him a dark, cold appearance. Actually, he is quiet but meticulous. He enjoys chatting with Uto and fully accepts his odd personality. His weapons are brass knuckles and throwing darts. His slender build makes him very agile. He dreams of going to Switzerland, a fact he only shared with Uto.

¬∑ Tuno & Toco: Twins, identical in looks and height. Wear similar post-apocalyptic clothing, head coverings, and goggles/masks, covering almost their entire bodies. Their weapons are an electric sniper rifle and a small pistol respectively. They are hired by the underground industry to compete with Uto and Dex for the Redstone. They have high synergy and strong determination.

¬∑ Kitan: Approximately 1.75m tall, male, wears a coffee-colored coat. Sent by a third faction to spy on Uto and Dex, but during this, his conscience struggles.

¬∑ KOLLER Corporation: The predecessor of the Black Valley Group, not yet as powerful. Currently managed by Kilo's father, Kendrick Koller. He is less wild than Kilo and operates within certain boundaries.

¬∑ DUEBEY Corporation: Koller's rival. Kitan is sent by Duebey. They have strength comparable to Koller.

Plot Summary:
The timeline is 2036. A miner discovers the energy-containing Redstone and plans to sell it privately to the Koller Corporation. The value of the stone inevitably attracts many competitors. To successfully deliver the stone to Koller, they hire Uto and Dex for the task, promising payment. Uto and Dex set off with the Redstone.
While crossing deserts and grasslands on an automated train, they are ambushed by Tuno and Toco. A fight ensues on the high-speed train. Uto and Dex expend great effort to defeat the twins. The twins' determination and synergy impress Uto and Dex, but they have no choice.
Later, Kitan is sent by Duebey to infiltrate Uto and Dex's group and steal the stone. Kitan plans ahead and successfully joins them without their knowledge. However, Uto and Dex's sincerity and their bond cause Kitan to waver. Despite this, Kitan eventually executes his plan, though it doesn't cause major casualties. Uto and Dex remain unaware of Kitan's betrayal. After this incident, Kitan quietly withdraws without obtaining the stone.
Later, Uto and Dex successfully deliver the Redstone to the Koller Corporation and receive a large reward. Finally, Dex leaves for another mission, giving Uto his brass knuckles as a gift before departing.

Light of Star I - Chapter 2

Main Characters:

¬∑ Boolt: Approximately 1.75m tall, wears a blue coat, weapon is a shotgun, wears a skull-shaped mask. Boolt founded a small group in Drylan called the Skull Squad, hence the mask. He is kind-hearted and low-key, and doesn't particularly like Uto's personality.

¬∑ KuZu-A: Approximately 1.8m tall, a robot created by the Duebey Corporation. Very agile, weapons are two twin swords. It has three horns on its head and a slender body. KuZu-A has a significant backstory. When Boolt first found him, he was broken and missing an arm. Boolt took him in, repaired him, and painted his original white body blue.

¬∑ Gree: Approximately 1.75m tall, a member of the Skull Squad. He is the same Gree from 2086, but still in his human body. He wears a black and green motorcycle jacket and also wears a skull mask. Gree is introverted and seems somewhat lost. He wants to open up. Uto influences his future path in some way.

¬∑ Uto: Uto is not particularly welcomed in this new group, though not treated badly. He maintains his quirky personality and helps them.

¬∑ Vantix (VT): Created by the Koller Corporation, approximately 1.8m tall. Kendrick built it to compete with Duebey's technology. VT is made of precise steel components, entirely black. The three red dot lights on its head serve as its eyes, creating a sense of oppression. Its steel fists are its weapons. VT is ordered to destroy KuZu-A, part of the corporate rivalry. In their first fight, VT easily defeats KuZu-A, leading to KuZu-A being abandoned by Duebey. Later, VT is enhanced with a portion of the Redstone's power, causing red light to emanate from its joints.

Plot Summary:
The timeline is 2042. After Dex leaves, Uto joins the Skull Squad in Drylan. Boolt has just found KuZu-A and had Gree repair it. Meanwhile, Koller's Kendrick learns KuZu-A wasn't destroyed and sends his Redstone-enhanced VT to finish the job. Boolt and the others naturally object. To protect KuZu-A, they accept the challenge. Although VT is enhanced, it is outnumbered and bound by its programming not to harm humans. Ultimately, with everyone's help, KuZu-A defeats VT.

Light of Star - Redstream Spinoff
Plot Summary:

The timeline goes back to 2038. The Koller Corporation obtains the Redstone and begins researching it. The protagonists are four Redstone researchers. During a close-range experiment, all four are affected by the Redstone's abstract power, each gaining different abilities. Two are significantly affected:
One is the lead researcher. After exposure, he turns into a monster with tan-yellow skin, orange eyes, and hands/feet resembling dinosaur structures. He also gains super-intelligence and a faint ability to foresee the future.
The other researcher gains a power: a black potential is born within him. This black potential is the precursor to the 2086 Black Creature. At this stage, it can be controlled, but only by this researcher himself; no one else can merge with it successfully later.
The other two researchers gain the ability to teleport and to create duplicates of themselves, respectively.
A conflict arises between the lead researcher and the one with the black potential. The lead, foreseeing the future, believes the black creature must be disposed of now to prevent a future threat. The host of the black potential disagrees, finding it too radical. He allies with the other two empowered researchers against the lead. The lead is defeated, temporarily ending the internal strife.

Light of Star - Dex Spinoff
Main Character:

¬∑ Dex: After leaving Uto, he continues taking on new missions.

Plot Summary: After leaving Uto, Dex's life continues with one job after another, encountering various partners and difficulties. But he never meets anyone who makes him feel the same way Uto did. Eventually, Dex leaves the mercenary business and travels to his dream destination, Switzerland. In 2056, he meets Uto again, who comes looking for him. This is the ending.

Light of Star - Resistance War: Jarfa Multi-Scenario

Main Characters:

¬∑ Jarfa: A member of the resistance during the war. Approximately 1.75m tall, flowing brown short hair, sea-blue eyes, slender build. His weapon is a long-barreled pistol, which he uses with great skill, earning him recognition.

¬∑ DK (1.3): Now one of the leaders of the resistance. He has a new body made of lighter aluminum alloy. His faceplate is smoother, with faintly glowing blue round eyes. He wears a light blue layered jacket, making him look like a trendy figure. His weapons now include a thick, long wooden staff, suggesting he might have taken up martial arts. DK is calm and gives a mature impression, his mindset surpassing ordinary levels.

¬∑ Golden Face - Gene: As the name implies, Gene has a golden face. Approximately 1.7m tall, relatively muscular build. Wears a white suit, the golden face being very conspicuous. He also wears a white bowler hat, giving him a gentlemanly appearance. He prefers using his fists and feet over drawing his gun. He is usually humorous but highly effective. He is an agent of the Guard, aiming to achieve a status like Infrared and Redshade Vridian. He is working hard.

¬∑ Infrared & Redshade Vridian: Key agents of the Guard, former partners who completed many missions together. However, Infrared seems reluctant to get too close to Redshade. Their relationship is somewhat tense.

¬∑ Chameleon Team: A special forces assault team of four, specially trained by Black Valley. They wear thermal imaging helmets, armor-piercing vests, and camouflage suits that change color with the environment. They are agile and have dedicated Karex flight vehicles. One member is unfortunately killed by Jarfa, leaving three.

¬∑ Tulak: Approximately 1.75m tall, center-parted black hair, dark skin. Wears black punk attire. Weapons include a short-barreled shotgun and a grenade launcher. He carries a rocket jetpack allowing short flights (~10m) that can also deploy smoke grenades, very advanced, built by Bruno. Tulak is one of the resistance leaders. He speaks little, acts decisively, and is somewhat cold-blooded.

¬∑ Kano: Approximately 1.85m tall, a robot agent of the Guard. Why can a robot be an agent? Kano was also installed with an Emotion Editor developed by Black Valley, giving him characteristics similar to DK. His body is made of black titanium, wears a black cloak, and has yellow eyes. Kano's structure is similar to Glare's. His weapon is a long katana. Kano unexpectedly falls in love with a female Black Valley employee who maintains him. They can only meet during periodic maintenance. A robot loving a human is unrealistic. During an invasion led by Tulak, they attack Kano during maintenance. Kano witnesses the employee being shot, planting a seed of hatred.

Jarfa Plot Summaries:

Scenario 1: You are Jarfa, a resistance fighter. After participating in battles, you meet DK. You and DK go through many hardships. Later, DK proposes bombing the Black Valley lab building to prevent more horrors. You infiltrate the lab, planting explosives. Finally, DK goes alone to place the final charge in the core area, giving you the detonator. Unfortunately, DK is killed by Infrared. You are also ambushed and subdued by Infrared, who takes the detonator. Everything goes black; you are killed by Infrared before activating the bombs.
The perspective shifts to Cassie, watching TV while recuperating. The news reports the lab was destroyed by rebels. Fey suggests they go search the ruins for useful items. Cassie agrees. Cassie's phone rings; it's Bruno asking them to come over for gifts. Cassie receives the ZOE drone, Fey gets a double-barreled sniper rifle that can fire two shots before rechambering, increasing rate of fire.
Ending 1 achieved.

Scenario 2: You are still Jarfa, but are separately approached by Black Valley higher-ups to join the Guard for high reward, recognizing your skills. You agree, join the Guard, get a new white ranger outfit, and are codenamed ""Angel."" Gene becomes your new partner. He treats you well; you become like comrades, fighting together. Gene opens up to you, sharing his thoughts and stories like a simple boy.
Finally, you are caught in an intense battle. Gene, seeking to achieve great merit, decides to fight, but tragically dies in the conflict, while you survive.

I don‚Äôt know if I should be upset about this, since I understand the need to be close to your parents even in adulthood or even if it‚Äôs weird for me to feel weird about it.

Additionally, her mom is in town right now (she lives a couple states over) staying at her apartment and, essentially, she said we won‚Äôt be able to see each other all week besides for me to meet her mom even though we live no more than 10 minutes away from each other. It‚Äôs not like I want to stay at her apartment when her mom is in town, but I was hoping to at least see her to get lunch or coffee at some point. I just kinda feel uninvolved and weird, like she‚Äôs ashamed of me or something, which I don‚Äôt think is the case since her mom says I sound nice and that from what she knows of me I sound like a good partner. 

My question is: should I be upset about this or am I just overthinking? If so, how should I express my discomfort about the situation with her without her feeling like I don‚Äôt want her to be close to her mom?

1nqqkgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1nqqkgl/what_finally_worked_for_my_adhd_after_years_of/,What FINALLY worked for my ADHD after years of failed ‚Äúhacks‚Äù,"I‚Äôve had ADHD my whole life but only got diagnosed last year at 31. For years I tried every hyped-up productivity system, Pomodoro apps, bullet journals, ‚Äúdeep work‚Äù trackers, and failed so hard every time. Each failure made me feel broken. I wanted to share the random little shifts that finally clicked, just in case they help someone else too.

Body doubling was my first breakthrough. I started using Focusmate after hearing it on a podcast, and it blew my mind how 50 minutes with a silent stranger can keep me locked in better than any timer. Another game-changer was the ‚Äúugly first draft‚Äù rule. I literally tell myself I‚Äôm trying to write garbage, and somehow the perfectionism freeze disappears. Even deleting Instagram during the week made a bigger difference than all those fancy blocking apps, because reinstalling adds friction my brain hates.

When I dug into the science, I realized why these hacks worked. Andrew Huberman talks about how ADHD brains need external structure, light, movement, visible time. A quick 10-minute walk and then NSDR (non-sleep deep rest) primes my brain better than coffee. Russell Barkley‚Äôs research shows ADHD isn‚Äôt laziness but a need for scaffolds to externalize time and goals, which finally made sense of my late dx. That‚Äôs why I swapped endless to-do lists for time blocks I can move around. Even small sensory tweaks matter; gum plus a fidget toy gives my brain just enough extra stimulation to focus longer.

Resources that shaped me: ADHD 2.0 reframed my brain as different, not broken, it‚Äôs the best ADHD book I‚Äôve ever read. Cal Newport‚Äôs Deep Work (NYT bestseller, insanely good read) made me rethink distraction, though I had to remix it into shorter sprints. Jessica McCabe‚Äôs How to ADHD YouTube channel felt like a survival guide made by someone who actually gets it. The Huberman Lab podcast gave me science-backed daily focus tools. A friend also put me on BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by a Columbia team. It turns books, research, and expert talks into podcasts you can tailor, choose 10, 20, or 40 minutes, even pick your host‚Äôs voice. Mine is a deep one like morgan freeman, and it learns from what I listen to and updates my learning plan. One episode combined ADHD 2.0, Huberman tips, and McCabe‚Äôs strategies into a morning plan I still use. And the Modern Wisdom podcast with Anna Lembke explained dopamine so clearly it finally made sense why doomscrolling fried my motivation.

The biggest shift wasn‚Äôt one single hack, it was realizing ADHD brains aren‚Äôt broken. We just need different inputs, structure, and learning loops. And daily reading and learning have been the only things that truly rewired me. Knowledge really does change everything.",10,1758856208.0,ADHDers,4,0.92,False

My mom and him got divorced like 12-13 years ago and he‚Äôs still living with her rent-free. I was really close to him as a kid because my mom has always been extremely closed off and kind of distant, so me and my brother just bonded more with him. I‚Äôm only now realizing as an almost adult that my dad is seriously a deadbeat. He will find a good paying job, stay there for like a year, during which he won‚Äôt pay ANY bills. We recently found out he didn‚Äôt pay the ONE bill my mom asked him to take care off, water, for almost 2 years. We found out because they shut it off. Instead of an explanation he just said, well I don‚Äôt have the money to pay it all off, and left my mom to foot the bill as usual. After staying at a job for a bit he‚Äôll just quit for absolutely no reason and with no plans or job prospect‚Äôs lined up. Which leads to him being unemployed for like months on end. He did that recently with a decent job he had for like a year. He didn‚Äôt tell us he was quitting just left us to figure it out ourselves by leaving a copy of his resignation letter on the counter. After I found out he quit his job AGAIN I got so angry and I‚Äôve kind of been cutting him off. I don‚Äôt really speak to him. Like I said im 17 and have my own job, and now that he‚Äôs unemployed he‚Äôs constantly like bumming off of me. Like every time I go out he asks me to buy him something. And when it first started I would listen. But eventually I realized he has no shame and is not grateful for ANYTHING. Like I would buy him a donut and he would get mad at me for buying him only one and not two, wouldn‚Äôt say thank you, and just go back up to his room. He got mad at me the other day for not getting him two coffee rolls from dunkin. I got him two donuts instead because they didn‚Äôt have any coffee rolls.

(And a quick note ‚Äî I will also continue looking through the provided resource guide to find things that I think will be helpful for her! I just figured since I was looking for something kind of specific, the collective may be able to point me in the right direction ~)

My best friend recently expressed that she is very interested in learning more about witchcraft, and I'd like to join her on the journey (I was very ""into"" general witchy subjects through most of my childhood/teenage years, and recently started reading tarot which has really brought me back to myself)!

When we last spoke about it, she was pretty convinced that she NEEDED to find a local mentor, as if she wouldn‚Äôt be ""official"" without one or something. While of course I understand the want/immense benefit of that, I'm also someone who thinks magic can be literally anything. Visualizing energy while you make your coffee; looking at yourself in the mirror and saying ""I'm gonna have a great day because I effing said so"" if that's what you need. I guess I'm just very casual in my interpretation of these things ‚Äî not that I take them lightly, I just think we genuinely do hold all the magic we need, and everything else (tools, ingredients, spells, etc.) are just ways to focus and enhance the energy we already have. 

SO, all that being said, I just don't want her to feel like she CAN'T explore these things without a professional there guiding her; I'd like to at least help/empower her to get started on her own while she looks for a teacher she trusts. My asks of you all today:

. If you are a/know of any practitioner(s) in the Seattle/Tacoma area that would be willing to help some fledglings out, I would love recommendations!

. Any books, podcasts, TikTok/YouTube accounts, or other resources that place an emphasis on sort of casual/everyday/practical magic and accessing the power we already hold in us would be AMAZING.

. Or, any other advice you may have on how to get her started! I would love to put something together for her for her birthday ‚Äî she loves cooking/baking and plants, so any suggestions on green & kitchen witchery-focused items would also be immensely helpful, if you happen to think of any!

Just wanted to share something strange (and honestly alarming) that happened to me recently with CIMB Bank PH.

At around **3:30 AM**, I noticed my CIMB account had been **deactivated without warning**. I've received that my virtual card has been successfully deactivated, but there's no SMS, no app notification. I called customer support by calling #2462 and they confirmed it was indeed deactivated but couldn‚Äôt explain why.

Thankfully, they sent me **instructions to recover my balance**, and I was able to follow them and get my money back within minutes. But here‚Äôs the thing: **I‚Äôm tech-savvy**. I know how to navigate apps, verify identity, and follow digital steps.

But what about those who aren‚Äôt?

I‚Äôve been reading posts on Reddit and Facebook, and it‚Äôs heartbreaking. **Many users, especially senior citizens have no idea what to do**. Some think their money is gone. Others don‚Äôt know how to reach support or follow the steps. And CIMB being a digital-only bank makes it even harder for those who rely on face-to-face help.

üîß Here's what worked for me:

1. Call CIMB support immediately.
2. Ask if your account is still active.
3. If deactivated, request **balance recovery instructions**.
4. Follow the email steps (usually involves verifying identity and selecting a transfer method).
5. Funds should be returned quickly‚Äîmine came back in minutes.

üß† My thoughts:

* CIMB needs to **improve transparency**. Sudden deactivation at 3:30 AM? That‚Äôs shady.
* They should **warn users ahead of time** or at least explain why it happened.

If you or someone you know is affected, feel free to DM me. I‚Äôm happy to walk you through the steps I took.

I‚Äôm a pansexual queer trans moody black cat alt artist with AuDHD who loves to paint, make digital art, drink tons of coffee and chai, collect songs but not really albums, is increasingly getting into female fronted doom metal bands, likes bowling, pool, occasional bar hangs, smoking out, causal gaming, collecting fancy books and art books, horror movies, attempting to craft, and an avid animal lover (currently a dad to a recovering pet shop Betta), and that‚Äôs just scratching the surface of my interests.

I‚Äôm new to poly after leaving a monogamous LTR and have been reading and learning as much as I can and getting myself into therapy. My current partner is also poly and has been for years, we‚Äôre not nesting but do plan to be next year and are currently the only partners for each of us. 

Not too great with keeping tabs on people online or the convo upkeep that requires so I would prefer more local people or those in the PNW that are available to meet up and see where the chemistry goes in person (platonic, sexual, romantic). I can be introverted and shy around new people but I do enjoy going out and doing things, bonus points if you are an extrovert who can deal with me needing a social buffer from time to time. But I promise once I‚Äôm comfortable the shyness and introversion melts away.

Background:
	‚Ä¢	For years I‚Äôve had poor eating habits: multiple coffees a day, very light meals/snacking, and usually just one proper meal.
	‚Ä¢	In the last 6‚Äì12 months (especially the 2 months before my GERD diagnosis) I ate a lot of takeout.
	‚Ä¢	Diagnosed with GERD/LPR about 2 months ago ‚Üí switched to a strict GERD-friendly, mostly low FODMAP diet.

Current regimen:
	‚Ä¢	Medication: Famotidine at night, and omeprazole/pantoprazole in the mornings. 
	‚Ä¢	Supplements: Physician‚Äôs Choice 60 Billion Probiotic (10 strains) + Benefiber daily as a prebiotic.
	‚Ä¢	Diet: Avoiding triggers, sticking mostly to low FODMAP foods.

Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	Bloating has improved.
	‚Ä¢	I feel very empty/hollow inside with strong depression and anxiety.
	‚Ä¢	Anxiety/panic attacks often flare if I eat gas-forming foods (especially when gas feels trapped and doesn‚Äôt pass). It leads to shortness of breath and pressure.
	‚Ä¢	Beans and mushrooms are the worst ‚Üí severe abdominal cramping + anxiety.

Questions:
	‚Ä¢	Could my PPI (omeprazole/pantoprazole) and H2 blocker (famotidine) be impacting my gut microbiome in ways that worsen anxiety/depression?
	‚Ä¢	Is the probiotic I‚Äôm taking a good fit for GERD/LPR, or should I consider different strains (e.g., mood-targeted ones)?
	‚Ä¢	Has anyone else experienced trapped gas triggering anxiety/panic, and what helped?
	‚Ä¢	Beyond probiotics/prebiotics, what else has helped you rebalance your gut and improve mood?

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone with similar experiences. I feel like the gut-brain connection is driving a lot of this, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out a way forward. The anxiety/depression is really isolating and scary.  ",1,1758855318.0,Microbiome,3,1.0,False

Backstory:

Perhaps when Dani was in Europe and Nicole was focused on growing her family and  her career, Anita and Vernon had a falling out because Vernon decided to run for yet another term, when he promised to retire from politics and Anita files for a separation and runs off to Europe, deciding that she shouldn't have given up her career and that she wants to revive it. She decides to go on a disastrous mini tour (where she is outshined by the latest R&B diva (who would be played later by a Tony Pinkins). Anita (going by her maiden name) is depressed and angry and is ultimately finds consolation in the arms of an introverted and bookish widower who is stationed at an Air Force base in Germany. They have a brief but passionate affair, which ends after Vernon calls and says he is willing to get on a plane to meet her and Anita confesses that her marriage is not over and while she led him to believe her marriage was over, she is going to give her marriage another try, leaving the widower heartbroken.

Fast forward 

Twenty some odd years and in a frenzy of activity, Dani bumps into an attractive man in the park, knocking newspaper and a cup of coffee out of his hand. Their eyes meet and this man comments ""Your eyes...have we met?"" Dani smiles and says ""I don't think so...but, can I get you a fresh cup of coffee?""

I found it only because I was going to The Motoring Club pretty regularly and started to walk around.

They are essentially a catering business that also serves fresh food with a sit-down area inside. I go there all the time for their salads, and occasionally switch up and get a quiche, a breakfast burrito, or a sandwich. Their soups and their rotating special menu item are also really tasty. Skip the Philly Cheesesteak, but almost everything else is solid.

1nqq3ir,https://i.redd.it/ladfymx8afrf1.jpeg,I am in severe gem-nancial disarray,"To preface, I consider myself a light spender. I bought 2 rewards cards, 2 battle passes, and the first platinum set. Because of this, I was planning on slowly accruing gems to pull on most limited characters, but only A0s and no weapons. 

Unfortunately, that dream ended today.

Here I was, with around 50k gems. I was sitting pretty, good for the foreseeable future. Now, S. Closer‚Äôs banner pops up, and seeing as I already pulled for Marian, Phoebe, and Chord, she would be the last piece of the insane DPS team puzzle. I also only had A0 Riko, so it would be great to get her some dupes. Now, here‚Äôs where the fun begins.

I go to hard pity and get Ryuji. Not terrible, I didn‚Äôt pull for Queen so he‚Äôs my assassin until Kasumi, which means it‚Äôs a pretty good outcome. At least I didn‚Äôt get another copy of Riddle (trigger warning).

Dejectedly, I go to full pity for S. Closer. Nice, I can stop here now that I got her A0. I have no plans to get her weapon. But wait, I think I forgot someone‚Ä¶.oh, right! Riko! How many copies did I get of her?

One. I got one (1) dupe of Riko. Utterly tragic.

Now, hear me out. What if I just went to 70/80, build up pity for the next limited character I wanted, AND get some Riki‚Äôs while I‚Äôm at it? Foolproof plan, right?

Right?

Well, I go to 69/70. No Rikos. At this point I was questioning if she really was a rate up. Oh well, let‚Äôs just hit 70 and finish building pity. We can always get Riko later.

70/80 hit, and out pops an S. Closer.

Damn it, there goes my pity. Well, at least A1 S. Closer isn‚Äôt bad. In fact, it‚Äôs pretty good. And now, I learned my lesson. Don‚Äôt gamble for pity and end up regretting it. 

Nope, that wasn‚Äôt the lesson. The lesson was that 70/80 was the limit.

I kept pulling, praying for Rikos and praying for the absence of S. Closer. I get to 22/80, and what do you know

TRIGGER WARNING! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

>!A wild Riddle appeared!!<

Hey, this isn‚Äôt all bad! I got an early pity, and now I can save up for Futaba! I was going to get S. Moko, but I lost quite a few gems so far, so oh well.

There‚Äôs one thing I forgot to mention: I skip signing Merope‚Äôs paper so I don‚Äôt get spoiled for a 5 star. I like to be a true gambler.

And so, within the 10 pull of >!Riddle!<, guess who else shows up? S. Closer, at the 28/80. I got my first double 5 star pull. But most importantly, it reset that pity.

Now, I was left with an A2 S. Closer, a nasty >!Riddle!<, a Ryuji, and‚Ä¶only 1 Riko dupe? What happened???

Here I was, with an A2 S. Closer, and an A2 Riko. Tell me it ain‚Äôt so.

Well, whatever. I decide to stop there. A3 S. Closed is the skill upgrade, so it isn‚Äôt worth it to chase that. I was left with a little hole in my heart, and a bigger one in my gem count.

But wait! It says 2/80 on the banner! I can‚Äôt let that slide, my OCD would never settle for that! And so, I did single pulls until I got to 10/80. I didn‚Äôt feel like skipping these, I needed to wallow in my despair.

But then, the 10th pull hit, and Merope pulled out a paper with‚Ä¶purple rainbow sparkles? Huh?

I sign the paper with a ‚ÄúAnn pls‚Äù and out pops‚Ä¶you guessed it, S. Closer. I had an A3 S. Closer, and an A2 Riko. You wouldn‚Äôt believe it unless you saw it.

Now I was pissed. Here I was with a stinky A3 S. Closer and an A2 Riko. At this point, I realized that this was the closest I‚Äôd ever get to an A6, and so, I let the gamba mentality take me over. I did a Zevai and rage pulled all the way to hard pity.

I got a Mona. A3 Mona. I was heartbroken. But on the bright side, I hit my A6 Riko!

And now, I pulled yet another Zevai and rage pulled all the way to a hard pity for S. Closer. No way was I sitting on A3 when A6 is RIGHT THERE. And now, she‚Äôs at A4.

Honestly, at this point, I‚Äôd consider myself pretty lucky. Sure, I lost 2 hard pities, but I also got an early 70/80, a 30/80 (along with >!The Rizzler!<) and a 10/80. I just needed to pray to RNJesus to give me the last 2 50/50 wins.

I had just enough gems left now for a pity and a half. I had a nearly empty gem wallet, but a big dream.

I did all the preparations: I watched the fireworks again with Motoha, I opened the contracts menu on that beach, and I silently prayed in my room. Then, I gambled. I gambled with my life on the line. 

And wouldn‚Äôt you know it, I won the first 50/50! A5 S. Closer came home! Now I had enough for about 20 pulls. Those 20 pulls came and went, with nothing to show for them.

Now, I was desperate. I calculated the gems I‚Äôd get from the remaining 27 days on the banner, and it came out to about 9,000 gems. Would that be enough? Even if I won the pity it wouldn‚Äôt be. I‚Äôm already at A5, I can‚Äôt let this slip by, even if I lose the 50/50. I NEEDED (infinite emphasis on needed) the A6. I‚Äôd do whatever it took.

It was at this point in which I fell into the hands of Black Wings and Sega while they had me by the balls.

I couldn‚Äôt wait that long just to lose the 50/50 and regret it forever. I decided I‚Äôd graduate from a light spender to a filthy whale. I pulled out the Visasan Black (iykyk) and swiped for the second platinum set, the rewards card, the seven day spoils pass, and the 1500+1500 cognite gems (because this would give me the most value with 26 tickets + 60 coffees). 

That wouldn‚Äôt be enough, though. I was sitting at 78/80. I thought about buying some more, but then realized I hadn‚Äôt finished the velvet trials yet! What a saving grace, I got my last 2 pulls in gems!

Now, I was scared. Really scared. I spent about $50 on this banner alone, and I didn‚Äôt want that all to go to waste on an A5. Sure, I could wait for the cognite shards, but who wants to sit on A5 for a full year? Not me. I‚Äôm not a sucker.

I pulled once. Nothing. I was at 79/80. It was the last chance. I pressed the button, and signed with the best damn drawing of S. Closer‚Äôs hat that I could ever possibly draw, and prayed hard. Then‚Ä¶she came home. I got my first and last A6.

In the end, the total damage was about 590 pulls, or 88,500 gems. This equates to about 7.3 hard pities, so in total, I technically won 5/6 of my hard pities. I‚Äôd consider that pretty lucky, given that I heard some people losing 50/50s back to back on banners.

Now, my S. Moko and Haru dream is gone, reduced to ashes. But, with the gem calculator tool somewhere on the internet, I was able to see that I could comfortably save for Futaba, Kasumi, CNY Rin, and Ange, all characters originally in my plan. Everything is good in the world, I have an A6, and my future pulls are still saved.

Now, this may not have been the best A6 to go for. Sure, I‚Äôm getting Kasumi, another Bless unit. Sure, Haru is probably a better sweeper than S. Closer. Sure, she doesn‚Äôt see much use in SoS or Guild Boss in TW/CN in the future. 

I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm happy with my easy auto team, and I‚Äôm happy with her aesthetics (Yes, I know she‚Äôs a high school girl, and yes I know it‚Äôs weird. It‚Äôs a drawing, get over it and go talk to some real women.)

Let this be a lesson to everyone to pull for what makes you happy, or let the gamba take over and empty your wallet. Whatever lets you sleep at night.

I‚Äôm not a whale, I just got lucky.

Then a text message arrived from an unknown number. It was a picture of his assistant's hand on his thigh in the suit pants I bought him.



The texts from his mi\*\*ress kept coming after that, a relentless barrage of poison. She sent photos of them in our bed and a video of him promising to leave me. She bragged that she was pr\*\*nant with his child.



He'd come home and k\*\*s me, call me his anchor, all while smelling of her perfume. He was buying her a condo and planning their future while I pretended to have morning sickness from bad scallops.



The final straw came on my birthday. She sent a picture of him on one knee, giving her a diamond promise ring.



So I didn't cry. I secretly changed my name to Hope, converted our entire fortune into untraceable bearer bonds, and told a charity to empty our house of everything.



The next day, as he headed to the airport for a""business trip"" to Paris with her, I flew to Portugal. When he came home, he found an empty mansion, divorce papers, and our wedding rings melted into a single, shapeless lump of gold.



Chapter 1



I remembered the first time Dustin touched my ch\*\*t. We were sixteen, crammed into the back of his dad's old Ford, fogging up the windows.



He was all nervous hands and shaky breaths, fumbling with the clasp of my b\*a like he was trying to solve a puzzle in the dark.



I finally had to reach back and unhook it for him. He went beet red, even in the faint moonlight, and stammered an apology.



It was funny. It was sweet.



For fifteen years, he was the only one. The boy who couldn't unhook a b\*a became the tech CEO who graced magazine covers.



To the world, we were the fairytale. The high school sweethearts who made it. Eliana and Dustin Powell. A brand. A testament to enduring love in a fast-paced world.



Our life was perfect.



Until it wasn't.



The text message arrived on a Tuesday. An unknown number.



It was just a picture, no words.



A woman's hand, nails painted a garish shade of pink, resting on a man's thigh. The hand was slender, young. Too young.



The thigh was clad in dark gray suit pants I recognized instantly. I'd bought them for him. Tom Ford. For his thirty-second birthday.



On the woman's wrist was a delicate gold bracelet with a single, tiny shark tooth.



I felt the air leave my lungs.



That bracelet. I'd seen it before.



On the wrist of Jami Salinas, his executive assistant. She'd flashed it at the company's summer party, her smile a little too bright, her eyes lingering on me a little too long.



My heart started a frantic, painful rhythm against my ribs.



It couldn't be.



But it was.



My first impulse was to scream. To throw my phone against the wall. To call him and demand an explanation for the image burning itself into my brain.



I didn't.



I took a deep, shuddering breath and forced the rage down. I stared at the photo until the details blurred, until the sickness in my stomach became a cold, hard knot.



Was any of it real? Our fifteen years? The boy in the back of the Ford? The man who ki\*\*ed me goodbye this morning?



The next day, I drove to the county courthouse. The building was old and smelled of dust and stale coffee.



I walked to the clerk's office, my steps even and measured.



""I'd like to file a petition for a name change,"" I told the woman behind the counter.



She looked up, her glasses perched on the end of her nose. ""For what reason?""



""Personal reasons,"" I said, my voice flat.



She raised an eyebrow, taking in my clothes, my bag. I was Eliana Powell, wife of a billionaire. Women like me didn't just change their names.



""Are you in danger? Is this related to domestic abuse?""



""No,"" I said. The lie tasted like ash, but it was a necessary one. This wasn't about danger. It was about erasure. ""I just want a new name.""



""What name did you have in mind?""



""Hope,"" I said, the word feeling foreign on my tongue. ""Hope Tillman."" Tillman was my mother's maiden name. A name that belonged to me, and me alone.



The clerk typed for a moment. ""And you are currently Eliana David Powell?""



""Eliana David,"" I corrected her. I had never taken his name. It was a point of pride once. Now, it was a convenience. ""My legal name is Eliana David.""



""The process will take a few weeks. You'll have to post a notice, attend a hearing.""



""I understand,"" I said. ""Please begin the process.""



She stamped the papers with a loud thud. Each stamp felt like a nail in the coffin of my old life.



Hope. A name for a future I couldn't yet see, but one I would build for myself, brick by painful brick.



The plan formed in my mind with chilling clarity. A new name. A new passport. A new life. Far away from here. Portugal. The Algarve coast. I'd always wanted to photograph the sea caves there.



I got the new social security card first. It came in a plain white envelope. Hope Tillman. It looked like a stranger's name.



I kept my old driver's license. A reminder of the ghost I was preparing to leave behind.



That night, I saw him on TV. He was at a charity gala, looking impossibly handsome in his tuxedo.



The reporter asked him about his success. He smiled that charming, public smile.



He held up his left hand, flashing the simple gold band I'd placed on his finger a decade ago. ""My biggest success is my wife, Eliana. She's my anchor.""



The crowd applauded. The reporter swooned.



""She's the best thing that ever happened to me.""



I watched the screen, my face a blank mask. The words meant nothing. They were just sounds, empty air. The man on the screen was a stranger performing a role.



My anchor. He was the storm, and I was the ship he was sinking.



The next morning, I took our wedding rings to a jeweler in a town an hour away. Not a fancy place, just a small, dusty shop run by an old man with a jeweler's loupe permanently attached to his eye.



I placed my ring and Dustin's matching band on the velvet tray. ""I want them melted.""



A sharp pain shot through my hand, as if the ring was still there, burning my skin. I clenched my fist.



""Melted?"" the old man asked, peering at the rings. ""These are fine pieces. 18-karat gold.""



""I know what they are,"" I said. ""Melt them. Together. Into a single, shapeless lump.""



He looked from the rings to my face, his expression unreadable. ""Are you sure, miss? This is... permanent.""



""Yes,"" I said, my voice unwavering. ""I'm sure.""



He shrugged and took the rings to the back. I waited, listening to the hum of the polishing wheel and the frantic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner.



An hour later, he returned with a small, gray velvet box.



Inside, resting on the white satin, was a lump of gold. It was ugly. Deformed. All the perfect circles and polished shine were gone, fused into an unrecognizable mass.



It was perfect.



He came home late that night, long after I'd hidden the small box in my closet. He brought me a bouquet of white lilies, my favorite.



""For my beautiful wife,"" he said, ki\*\*ing my cheek.



He smelled of her. That same cloying, fruity perfume Jami always wore.



I didn't pull away. I just stood there, a statue in his arms.



As he moved past me into the kitchen, I saw it. A faint red mark on his neck, just above his collar. A love bite. Sloppy. Careless.



Did you have fun at your ""late meeting,"" Dustin? I wanted to ask. Did you enjoy her young, eager body in your office?



But I said nothing. The time for questions was over.



He wrapped his arms around my waist from behind, pulling me against him. ""I missed you today.""



I felt a wave of nausea. The touch of his hands on my skin felt like a violation.



I gently pushed him away. ""I'm tired, Dustin.""



Chapter 2



""Tired?"" He sounded surprised. ""Is everything okay, Eli?""



""Just a long day,"" I lied, moving towards the stairs.



""Well, let me make it better,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, su\*\*estive purr. He followed me, his hand reaching for mine.



I flinched away from his touch.



He stopped, a flicker of something-annoyance? confusion?-in his eyes. ""Okay. I get it. I've been working a lot. Let's have a date night tomorrow. Just the two of us. We can go to that place you love, the one by the coast.""



""Fine,"" I said.



He smiled, relieved. ""Great. I have a surprise for you, too.""



""I have one for you, as well,"" I said, thinking of the gray velvet box upstairs.



His smile widened. ""Oh yeah? Is it my birthday already?""



The question was a bitter joke. My own birthday had been last week. He'd forgotten. Sent a text from a meeting in Tokyo. 'Happy bday, babe. Super busy. Celebrate when I'm back.' He never mentioned it again.



""No,"" I said. ""Just because.""



He came closer, trying to k\*\*s me. I turned my head, and his lips met my cheek.



""Okay,"" he said, pulling back, looking a little hurt. ""I'll see you in the morning.""



I lay in bed that night, staring at the ceiling, listening to his steady breathing beside me. This was a performance now. The last act of a long-running play. And I knew my lines.



The next evening, he was all charm, holding the car door open for me, his hand on the small of my back.



He chattered the whole way to the restaurant, talking about a new deal, a difficult board member, a rival company's failure. I made the right noises, nodding and smiling in the right places.



As he pulled into the valet line, something on the passenger side floor caught my eye. A single, long, blonde hair.



Jami's hair.



I looked at it, then looked away. I didn't pick it up. I didn't point it out.



There was no point in fighting anymore. You don't argue with a ghost. And he was already a ghost to me.



The restaurant was where he'd proposed. Perched on a cliff overlooking the ocean, the waves crashing below. It was supposed to be our place.



Tonight, it would be the place where it all ended.



As we walked in, a woman at a nearby table gasped. ""Oh my God, it's Dustin Powell!""



He gave her a gracious nod, the tech king in his element.



He'd just called work, a ""quick emergency."" He stood a few feet away, his back to me, his voice low and urgent.



""I'm sorry, baby, I have to step out,"" he said, turning back to me, his face a mask of regret. ""Something's come up at the office. A server farm in quadrant four is down. It's a mess.""



""Go,"" I said.



""I'll be so quick. Twenty minutes, tops. Don't you move, okay? Order us a bottle of the good stuff."" He winked.



A woman at the next table sighed dreamily. ""He's so dedicated. And so in love with his wife.""



I knew where he was going. He wasn't talking to his head of engineering. He was talking to Jami. The ""server farm"" was her apartment. The ""emergency"" was her.



I went back to the car. I told the valet I'd forgotten my wrap.



His second phone, the one he thought I didn't know about, was in the glove compartment. It was unlocked.



The texts were right there.



Jami: 'Heard you're on a date with the old lady. Boring.'



Dustin: 'Have to keep up appearances. Be there in 10. Wear that red thing I like.'



Jami: 'Hurry up. I have a surprise for you.'



Then a photo. Jami, pouting at the camera, wearing a red lace teddy. On the nightstand behind her was a small, blue box from Tiffany's.



My stomach churned. I felt a violent, visceral need to throw up. The perfectly cooked scallops I'd just eaten threatened to make a reappearance.



He came back twenty-five minutes later, looking pleased with himself. ""All handled. See? Told you I'd be quick.""



I forced a smile, the muscles in my face protesting.



""Are you okay?"" he asked, seeing my pale face. ""You look a little green.""



""Just... the scallops,"" I managed to say. ""Maybe they were a bit off.""



""That's it,"" he said, his face darkening. ""I'm going to have a word with the manager. This place has gone downhill.""



""No, Dustin, don't,"" I said. ""It's fine.""



He looked at me, his brow furrowed. ""You know, I was thinking about what you said. About my birthday. I know I forgot yours. I'm a j\*\*k. I'm so sorry, Eli.""



The apology, so late, so hollow, hung in the air between us.



""I'm going to make it up to you,"" he said, his voice earnest. ""I promise.""



I thought of the red lace teddy. The Tiffany box. The server farm in quadrant four.



I felt the vomit rise in my throat. I stumbled out of my chair and ran for the bathroom, barely making it to the stall before I was sick.



Chapter 3



I stayed in the bathroom for a long time, splashing cold water on my face, my reflection a pale, haunted stranger in the mirror.



Dustin was waiting for me, his face etched with concern. ""Are you sure you're okay? We can go home.""



How could he be so good at this? The lies, the performance. A part of me wondered if he even knew he was doing it anymore. If the line between the loving husband and the cheating ba\*\*ard had blurred so much in his own mind that he couldn't see it.



The cool night air on the drive home cleared my head. The nausea subsided, replaced by a cold, clear calm.



""I'm feeling better,"" I said, as he pulled into the garage.



""Good,"" he said, his hand on my knee. ""Because I still have that surprise for you.""



""Tomorrow,"" I said. ""Let's do surprises tomorrow.""



He looked disappointed but nodded. ""Okay. Tomorrow.""



A wicked little idea sparked in my mind. A final, parting shot.



""Actually,"" I said, turning to him. ""I've been thinking. You're right. We need more time together. Why don't you take tomorrow off? We can spend the whole day together. Here. At home.""



He looked surprised. Then a little panicked. A whole day. A whole day he couldn't sneak away to see Jami.



""I... I don't know, Eli. I have that big presentation...""

Go easy on me here - big time novice here. I'm looking to upgrade my current espresso machine (Smeg ECF01. I know...) and would prefer to spend between $800-1200 but have found the million and one variables and considerations leaving me with analysis paralysis.

Machines I'm looking at/considering:

Profitec GO

Ascaso Steel Uno

Quick Mill Pippa

Breville Dual Boiler

I realise these machines aren't all in the same class but am hoping to get opinions on value for what I'm after.

Factors at play:

Wife and I drink 1-2 coffees a day on average. We're pretty on the go and value expediency and a low-fuss process, so a long heat-up time or super-finicky transition from brewing to steaming is not optimal. A roughly even mix of black/white coffees so steaming is relevant. Aesthetics are important to us, which is why I've shortlisted the above for reference (Breville not as much, but the new Sea Salt variant looks ok and potentially good value). Minimal detailing, refined materials/touches etc. Essentially anything is an upgrade for us in terms of the quality of the espresso pulled so I'd be willing to compromise on that point (a little) if it meant getting a machine we like the look of that doesn't require too much tinkering or fuss on each use. Keen to dial a machine in and have fun with it don't get me wrong, but not looking to spend ages in the kitchen making coffee either.

I have a 1zpresso X-Ultra manual grinder which I'm happy with so just need a solid machine to go with it. if there are any other machines you'd suggest, hit me!

No matter how much I think about it, I seem to forget all the little details that really matter to people. I want to give gifts that feel personal and thoughtful, but often I end up second-guessing myself or buying something generic that I think might be safe. Even when I try to pay attention during conversations, I forget what someone mentioned last week or last month, and it can be frustrating.

Over the years, I‚Äôve tried a few different methods to stay organized. I used to jot down small notes on my phone whenever someone mentioned a favorite snack, a hobby, or a restaurant they liked. I even made a few spreadsheets to keep track of birthdays, favorite colors, and other preferences. While these methods helped a little, they were often tedious to maintain and hard to keep updated. I would either forget to write something down or lose track of the details. Sometimes I would think I remembered, only to realize I completely forgot the person‚Äôs favorite coffee shop when it came time to pick a gift.

Recently, I started looking for ways to make this easier, and I discovered that there are tools that can help organize and even suggest gifts based on the information you already know about someone. I started experimenting with one that takes the small details you have about friends and family and generates ideas for gifts or places to take them for a meal. It doesn‚Äôt replace the thought you put into the gift, but it helps make the process less stressful and makes it easier to remember the little things that make a gift meaningful.

What I have found so far is that this approach works best when you combine it with paying attention to your friends‚Äô interests. For example, if someone mentions they like a specific type of chocolate or that they recently enjoyed a certain restaurant, adding that information into the tool makes it more likely that the suggestions will actually resonate with them. I‚Äôve found that the gifts I pick with this method feel more personal, and my friends actually notice the thoughtfulness. It also reduces the anxiety of worrying that I might forget something important or pick something generic that won‚Äôt be appreciated.

I‚Äôm curious how others handle this problem. Do you have a system for remembering the small preferences of the people you care about? Do you rely on notes, memory, or some kind of tool? I would love to hear your tips and tricks. Even with the help of AI or tools, there is something about the human touch in gift-giving that cannot be replaced, but having a little assistance makes the whole process much smoother and more enjoyable. I‚Äôm always looking for new ways to improve, and it would be great to learn from the strategies other people use to make their gifts feel more personal and thoughtful.

I'm probably out of touch so feel free to help me with the math.

I saw that Starbucks has an average revenue of $3,800 per store daily in the US. Let's say baristas make $15/hour, there are 4 workers in a shift, and 3 shifts through the day. If I order one drink, the cost is probably $5 to $7. A basic $1 tip is 14% to 20%, which is on par for tipping at a sit-down restaurant, so that seems out of line for a retail drink.

Looking at it another way - as to the hourly income for the baristas. Say sales revenue is $3,800 for the day. Let's say a bunch of people don't tip but others do 15%, so maybe an average of 5% for the day. That's $190 of tips for the day. Divided by the 12 barista shifts (4 workers x 3 shifts), that's $16 to each barista.Spread over an 6-hour shift, that's $2.67/hour additional wages, or 18% increase over their base.

The $16 to each barista for a whole shift doesn't seem like a lot, but 18% increase over their base seems heavy. And me paying 15% on a single drink seems excessive. The other hard part is that 99% of the time is to-go, so I won't know until later if the drink is even correct.

So what about quick-service like Chipotle or Qdoba? A meal is about $9-$12. A basic $1 tip is 8% to 11%, which is less than sit-down. Like the coffee, I order to-go so don't find out until I get home whether they gave a weak or hefty scoop of meat.

So coming to the end of this thesis, I arrive at two conflicting notions. On one hand, I like to be nice, and tipping ""fits"" with being nice. However, unless I start dealing in nickels, the tipping system is distorted relative to the product purchased. Nevermind that it's a distortion supported by restaurant owners so they can keep the sticker prices lower and not have to pay employer costs (e.g. payroll taxes) on the tips.

If anyone has more specific numbers for any of these, I'd love to hear it.",0,1758854029.0,Omaha,11,0.22,False
1nqpun2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1nqpun2/a_year_without_tiktok_a_personal_review/,A Year Without TikTok: A Personal Review,"(Yesterday, I posted `How I uninstalled TikTok and keep it away for a year`. I see there are many views. I'd like to write some more. Hope this helps.)

\-

I didn‚Äôt delete TikTok because I‚Äôm above it. I deleted it because I wasn‚Äôt. My thumb learned a path my brain didn‚Äôt approve of: unlock ‚Üí swipe ‚Üí neon slot machine. I‚Äôd open it to watch one cooking hack, and surface forty-five minutes later wondering why I was watching a man in Norway fold towels with one hand. That would‚Äôve been fine if it happened once a week. It was happening daily.

The moment I finally quit wasn‚Äôt dramatic‚Äîno digital epiphany, no documentary. I was microwaving cold coffee at 9:10 a.m., standing in the kitchen, half-listening to a coworker on a call, and realized I‚Äôd opened TikTok without looking at my phone. Muscle memory had beaten intention. That scared me more than screen time numbers did. I held the icon until it wiggled and tapped delete. I felt a weird flash of grief, like ending a fun but chaotic friendship.

# Week 1: Withdrawal (and Phantom Thumb Syndrome)

The first week sucked. My hand kept doing that unconscious reach during micro-boredom: elevator rides, toast popping, waiting for a file to upload. I‚Äôd feel a pulse of anticipation, a little dopamine flare, and then nothing. That gap was loud. I wasn‚Äôt calmer. I was twitchy.

I replaced the itch with friction:

* I gave my Screen Time passcode to a friend and asked not to give it back without a 24-hour delay.
* I blocked the App Store after 9 p.m. and added a content filter to stop TikTok‚Äôs site from loading.
* I removed Instagram and YouTube from the home screen, because my brain is lazy and will take whatever is nearest. I didn‚Äôt want to replace one slot machine with another.

I also made a ‚Äúboredom menu‚Äù on a sticky note:

* Ten push-ups
* Make tea
* Read three pages of a book
* Wipe the counter
* Go outside for two minutes
* Text someone I like

It felt corny. It also worked.

# Month 1: System > Willpower

By week three, the automatic reach faded. What helped most wasn‚Äôt grit; it was architecture.

* I turned my phone black-and-white at night. It‚Äôs ridiculous how much less interesting the world is in grayscale.
* I made my home screen boring: calendar, notes, weather. The App Library did the rest.
* I installed a browser extension that kills short-form video feeds. If I try to watch YouTube Shorts, it loads a breathing exercise instead. It‚Äôs hilarious and maddening.
* I set a five-minute timer for ‚Äújust checking something.‚Äù If I exceed it, my phone goes to Do Not Disturb via a shortcut. It gamified my own tendency to drift.

What surprised me was how much those small barriers changed the feel of my day. The ‚Äúgap moments‚Äù got quieter. I still wanted quick hits, but I learned to sit through the first 60 seconds of craving and it would pass. That was new.

# What Filled the Space (and What Didn‚Äôt)

Truthfully, nothing filled the TikTok slot perfectly, because the slot itself‚Äîconstant variable reward‚Äîwas the problem.

* I tried replacing it with longer videos. That backfired. Long videos scratched the same itch, just less efficiently.
* Reading worked, but only if the book was easy and nearby. I started keeping a paperback in the kitchen.
* Podcasts were perfect for chores. My sink became a podcast-only zone. If my hands got sudsy, I didn‚Äôt scroll.
* Walking without headphones mattered more than I expected. The first silent walks felt itchy and dull. By month two, they felt like a reboot.

The biggest gain was attention. Not hours; attention. I could read ten pages without flipping to another tab in my mind. I didn‚Äôt realize how shredded my focus had gotten until it started to come back.

# Social FOMO, Trends, and Not Knowing the Sound Everyone‚Äôs Using

I missed things. Friends referenced audio clips and I smiled like I got it. I didn‚Äôt. The world didn‚Äôt end. I saw the best stuff later on group chats or in articles. The half-life of trends is short, and missing the front wave didn‚Äôt change my life.

The one real downside: if your work or humor leans on constant cultural riffing, you feel slower. There were times a TikTok link landed in the chat and I just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt click. I was both relieved and out of the loop. Mixed bag.

# Numbers I Actually Care About

* Average daily phone time dropped by about 45 minutes within two weeks. Not dramatic, but real.
* I fell asleep 20‚Äì30 minutes earlier most nights, which compounded fast.
* I read 12 books this year. Last year I read four.
* I took more midday walks‚Äîabout 3‚Äì4 a week‚Äîbecause there wasn‚Äôt a quick-dopamine alternative when I hit a wall.
* My Sundays felt longer. Not objectively, but in that elastic way time feels when you don‚Äôt chop it into neon confetti.

# Temptations and Near-Misses

A few times, muscle memory and curiosity teamed up. I typed ‚Äútik‚Äù into the App Store search bar without thinking. Seeing my own fingers spell it out felt like watching someone else. That‚Äôs when the passcode rule mattered. Future Me always thanks Past Me for making reinstallation annoying.

I also noticed triggers:

* Finishing a hard task (I wanted a treat).
* Right after lunch (energy dip).
* Social anxiety before events (avoidance).

Preloading alternatives helped. I kept a playlist called ‚ÄúStupidly Good‚Äù for post-task treats, and I had a standing rule: if I‚Äôm anxious, I call someone for two minutes or step outside. It sounds earnest. It works.

# Honest Downsides

* I missed spontaneous discovery. TikTok‚Äôs algorithm is ridiculously good at showing you something you didn‚Äôt know you wanted. Books and podcasts are slower to surprise.
* I lost a quick way to find niche communities. There‚Äôs something unmatched about stumbling into ‚Äúpeople who love grout cleaning‚Äù at 11 p.m. I found those communities elsewhere, but it took effort.
* I had to confront baseline boredom. It‚Äôs easier to be ‚Äúthe person who‚Äôs trying a dopamine detox‚Äù than to be a person who just sits on their own couch with their thoughts. I met some parts of myself I‚Äôd been drowning out. That‚Äôs both a con and a pro.

# What Came Back

* Idle thoughts. The kind where you remember a birthday before the reminder or get a weird idea for dinner. They needed silence to appear.
* Conversations. I interrupted people less. I noticed when my attention drifted and pulled it back.
* Taste. Without a firehose of clips telling me what to like, I got pickier and oddly more delighted by small things‚Äîone truly great essay, one perfect live performance, one dumb local event.

# Was It Worth It?

Yes. Not because TikTok is evil, but because it was too perfect at bypassing my intentions. The cost wasn‚Äôt the hours; it was that I outsourced my curiosity to an algorithm that thinks a little like me but louder. A year without it felt like turning the volume down to hear my own station again.

Will I ever reinstall? Maybe‚Äîfor a project, for a season, as dessert, not dinner. But I don‚Äôt miss the autopilot.

# If You‚Äôre Considering It

* Build friction, not heroics: passcode with a friend, block the site, hide replacements.
* Replace the tap with a ritual: tea, walk, text, one page of reading. Keep it dumb and easy.
* Expect a noisy first week. That‚Äôs normal, not failure.
* Track one metric you actually care about (sleep, reading pages, steps), not just screen time.

Afternoon Paul: starts dropping puppet/strings metaphors like he‚Äôs auditioning for a stage play.

Evening Paul: smooth operator, thief-level cautious, baiting random strangers with handkerchief codes??

Night Paul: cracks, rants directly at ME through the page, asks if I could take the blame üò≠.


And the next day?? He wakes up acting like none of it happened. Just back to being the weird schoolboy with odd vibes.

Idk man, Paul isn‚Äôt even a character at this point, he‚Äôs like 4 people stuffed into one body.

Do y‚Äôall think this is intentional (mask themes, identity crisis, etc.) or is Paul just written like a gacha character with multiple skins??

We met on Hinge and she's the first match that I've met in person, and this is after I paid the premium üíÄ. (The premium is worth it tho because for 2 years before that I didn't get a single match but since then I've gotten 10 matches). Anyways I asked her out on a date on a prompt that said I should ask her out by being direct and having a plan, which I responded to with a lunch date plan, she then matched with me and decided that it was a good idea and we should meet this weekend. But then we realised we're in the same college and decided that we might as well meet in college on a mini date where we just roam around for a bit, have something to eat before we go on an actual date.

So about the actual date... IT WENT ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. Like it couldn't have gone any better for a first date, that to my first ever first date. So I wasn't hungry and neither was she so we settled on cold coffee only... And then we talked for an hour... Whenever it got awkward we just looked at each other and laughed... We talked a lot eventually... And then once we were out I gave her flowers (she mentioned she loved sunflowers and she got flowers from this one vendor so I went to that vendor to get her those flowers) and she was surprised, blushed a little cause she didn't expect it, and then I complimented on how good she looked, and then she blushed again and she's like I'm sorry I'm blushing like an idiot and I'm like It's okay because Ik I'm doing things right and she blushed again...we hugged a few times, then took photos, I even met her roomate cause she told her hostel roommates that she's going on a date and then I said bye. She also remarked on how good the date went and I smiled and told her that I was gonna pick her up on Saturday from her Hostel to take her out to Lunch.

So yeah I'll be going on another date tomorrow with this incredibly beautiful girl and it's looking great.

TL:DR - I went on a date for the first time with a girl on hinge, she is in my college so we met there itself and went to a cafe to have cold coffee, then we talked a lot about each other, looked at each other and laughed in between topics and awkwardness and eventually just left. When leaving I gave her flowers which made her blush after which I also complimented her saying she looked pretty which made her blush again, after which we hugged, took photos and now I'm gonna pick her up again on Saturday for Lunch.",4,1758853782.0,DatingInIndia,1,0.84,False

We tallied together. How many nights had you stayed at mine this week? How many mornings had I woken up in your much comfier bed? How many hours left of work before we‚Äôd be reunited again? The numbers weren‚Äôt burdens then, they were gifts. Weekends slipped through our fingers like quicksilver, vanishing before we even knew they‚Äôd begun.

1nqpoyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nqpoyk/i_25f_need_to_reconnect_with_an_old_ex_28m/,I (25F) need to reconnect with an old ex (28M)- desperately need advice.,"I had a very, very toxic short lived relationship with someone, let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄòSteve‚Äô (28M).

I met Steve in 2022, and we started dating shortly after I had left a long term relationship of 3 years. I was very upfront about where I was at the time (probably a little more casual, but preferred to date one person at a time even w/o titles or whatever just so I can focus on getting to know someone) and he said he was totally cool with that. 

On our very first date I told him it was a boundary for me, and if he was more of a ‚Äúcast a wide net‚Äù dater- that was totally okay but we should probably be friends. He assured me he was on board with the idea and we happily continued on. 

To save many, many paragraphs, here‚Äôs everything the next 4 months entailed:

 (Skip to ** if you don‚Äôt want to read allat)

- Cheated on me with his girl best friend and left evidence of said cheating in the center of his apartment, refused to move it as if it were a wonderful shrine. Girl bestie was also in her own, separate relationship with a guy of 8 months. 

- He got HSV after attending a rave, insisted it was ‚Äúbecause he shared a water bottle with someone‚Äù. For those who don‚Äôt know, that has a ~0.000001% chance of being true, but hey, let‚Äôs give him the benefit of the doubt!

- Proceeded to lie about taking HSV medication to prevent spreading HSV to me. Said his Dr said it was ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù to transmit HSV when there is no break out. I am a nurse. This is not true.

- Had an insane porn addiction (5-7x/wk). We were intimate 2-3x/wk for reference. Refused to drop it.

- Never took care of me during intimacy or even asked to. Iykyk.

- Encouraged me to come to not one, but two, multi-day music festivals that costed ~$300-400 each, then told me within a day or two of each festival that he would prefer to just go with friends. I worked a minimum wage job at the same and would save up HEAVILY to be able to go, then would have to freak out and sell my tickets at insanely low prices to make back anything I could.

- Constantly made comments on my appearance and told me ‚Äúhow to look better‚Äù.

- Said I was ‚Äúbig for a girl‚Äù because I am 5‚Äô5. He is 5‚Äô7.

- Allowed (and took part in) his friends bullying me (berating, cyberstalking). I wish I could say I did something worthy of bullying- I never even met most of them.

- Caught him on dating apps and then he would lie and say he wasn‚Äôt (he would just find ways to hide it better). 

- Cheated on me again and then lied about it being SA. He openly admitted he lied about it being SA a week later (after I had spent a week comforting him and tending to his every need).

**

Ultimately- there is SO MUCH MORE but I don‚Äôt feel inclined to keep going. This guy was a total weirdo and if I wasn‚Äôt in such a vulnerable part of my life I probably would not have gone on a third date with the guy. 

He had a full speed run of trauma to unleash on me and three years later I am still struggling with trust issues, confidence issues, and allowing myself to fully love anyone or anything. 

In a very real sense- he ripped any innocence I had left at the time and I felt as though I had been dunked into the world‚Äôs sh*ttiest cold plunge of d*uche bags. 

I joke a lot here- but I wouldn‚Äôt talk so candidly in real life. 

Steve still lives in my town and I feel constant anxiety about running into him at local events or restaurants. Petrifying, fight or flight anxiety. I‚Äôve tried therapy, opening up to loved ones, and journaling all the time. 

As much as I don‚Äôt like this guy, I think the only option I have left to get over this situation is to simply text him and ask him to meet for coffee or dinner. To face my fear head on and tell myself that he‚Äôs not this big, bad monster I‚Äôve built him up to be in my head. He‚Äôs just another loser with a dangle cross earring. 

And no- I‚Äôm not planning on just berating the guy and throwing my drink in his face. I‚Äôm aiming for a casual conversation that will humanize him to me so I stop being so afraid of him.

QUESTION: 

How do I go about initiating contact? 
Suggestions for opening lines? 
Suggestions for location types (I.e; coffee shop, casual dinner, etc.)?

**

TLDR; How would you initiate contact with an ex who did a ton of sketchy, traumatic things to you, in hopes to better cope with the situation?

1nqpn2i,https://i.redd.it/qmntkwtt5frf1.png,"My brother's company went bankrupt, and I became the debt payment sent","Chapter 1

My brother's company went bankrupt, and I became the debt payment sent straight to Edward Pierce, the infamous big shot in Elarwyn that everyone feared.



Everyone thought I was just a helpless sacrifice, but only I knew the truth. This was a carefully orchestrated gamble I'd been plotting for ages.



I was betting that Edward still cherished our past, that I was still the unforgettable mark in his heart.



For three years, I clung to him like a parasitic vine, tiptoeing around him and always acting the part of the gentle, obedient lover.



That was until those two stark red lines showed up on the pregnancy test. When I nervously asked if he liked kids, he just said, ""No, they're a hassle. And having one out of wedlock is even more trouble."" His words hit me like a bucket of ice water, crushing every last bit of hope I had.



But I never expected that just when I thought I could finally start a new life, running away with the baby growing inside me, Edward would come after me like a madman.



He cornered me in a foreign land, eyes red with fury, jaw clenched tight. ""The debt's not settled yet. You think you can just run? Not a chance.""



I'd stayed by Edward's side for three years.



Back then, when my brother Michael Linley's company went bankrupt and owed Edward a fortune, I became the debt payment.



Or at least, that was what everyone else believed.



Back then, the succulent I'd been nurturing on the windowsill for half a year had just put out fresh, dazzling green shoots. Michael's eyes were rimmed red as he said, ""Sophia, I'm so sorry.""



I patted his hand and said softly, ""It's okay, Michael. I'll go.""



But deep down, only I knew that this was mostly my own choice, my plan.



I'd had a crush on Edward for years; ever since he was just a nobody, a fresh-faced kid trying to make it in the world, long before he became the big shot in Elarwyn who could call the shots and turn the tides with a single word.



For those three years, I lived in his penthouse that overlooked half of Elarwyn. I was like a pampered canary, carefully looked after but always kept in a gilded cage.



When Edward was in a good mood, he'd bring me along to some not-so-important private parties. He'd introduce me in a vague way, and everyone knew the score; nobody ever asked any questions.



But when Edward got busy, it was perfectly normal not to see him for ten days, even half a month.



That night, I was half-asleep when I heard the soft click of the bedroom door opening.



Then, his familiar scent, tinged with a trace of alcohol, drifted over me.



I knew he was back.



I stayed perfectly still, pretending to be sound asleep.



Edward seemed to stand by the bed for a while, then lifted the edge of the blanket and quietly slipped in beside me.



His slightly cool, damp arms pulled me in, his chin pressing lightly against the top of my head.



""You've been drinking again?"" I mumbled sleepily.



I could already smell the expensive liquor and cigarettes clinging to him.



""Yes,"" Edward murmured, his voice rough and tired from a long night. ""Had to talk business, and just had a couple of drinks.""



I snuggled deeper into his arms, shifting around until I found a comfortable spot.



But he couldn't keep his hands to himself. His rough fingers gave my waist a gentle squeeze, then trailed beneath the hem of my pajamas.



""No, please,"" I murmured, grabbing his hand, my voice heavy with sleep. ""I'm exhausted. Let's do this tomorrow.""



Edward gave a low laugh, his chest vibrating against me, his warm breath tickling my ear. ""I won't be free tomorrow.""



With that, Edward rolled over, pressing me beneath him.



The curtains weren't fully drawn, and the neon lights slipped through the gaps, painting shifting patterns of light and shadow across his chiseled face.



\*\*\*\*\*



By the time I woke up, it was nearly noon.



Edward was long gone, and the other side of the bed was cold.



I still felt clean, so I guess he took care of me before he left.



Supporting my sore waist, I sat up and saw a glass of warm water and a sticky note on the nightstand. His bold scrawl read: \[Mr. Armstrong will come by this afternoon. There's a document for you to sign.\]



'Figures. More paperwork,' I thought, rolling my eyes.



It was always either some stock transfer or a pointless authorization form, not that I ever understood them, or even needed to.



I rubbed my temples and shuffled into the bathroom.



Looking at myself in the mirror, I saw that my face was a bit pale, with faint shadows under my eyes.



Just as I was about to brush my teeth, my stomach suddenly turned upside down. I gripped the sink, dry heaving a few times, but nothing came up. It just brought tears to my eyes.



This feeling was familiar.



My heart skipped a beat, and my hand instinctively rested on my stomach.



Last month, I thought my period was late.



At the time, I'd been too busy helping Michael with his new company to pay a lot of attention. Plus, Edward had been swamped with work, and we barely saw each other. So I hadn't really thought much of it.



My hands were trembling as I dug out an unopened pregnancy test from the bathroom cabinet.



Five minutes later, I stared at those two glaring red lines; my mind went completely blank.



The test slipped from my fingers and hit the cold tile with a sharp clatter, the sound echoing through the empty bathroom.



'Huh? I-I am actually pregnant?' I thought, my heart pounding out of control.



Edward and I always used protection, except for that one night. A little over a month ago, he'd come home from a celebration, clearly upset and more than a little drunk, and kept me up in bed nearly the whole night.



That time, we didn't use protection.



I leaned against the wall and slowly slid down to the floor, my mind turning into a complete mess.



This baby really couldn't have come at a worse time.



That evening, Edward came home unusually early.



He tossed his suit jacket onto the couch, loosened his tie, and walked straight to the liquor cabinet to pour himself a glass of whiskey.



I sat across from him in the armchair, fidgeting with the tassels on the throw pillow without even realizing it.



He took a sip of his drink, his gaze lingering on me, like he could tell I wasn't quite myself.



""What's wrong?"" he asked. His tone was flat, completely unreadable.



I took a deep breath, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Edward, do you like kids?""



His hand holding the glass paused for a moment, the ice cubes making a sharp clink against the side.



Then he looked up at me, his gaze piercing, like he was trying to see straight into my soul. After a long pause, he finally spoke, his voice colder than the ice in his glass.



""No."" He didn't even hesitate.



My heart sank, and I gripped the tassels of the pillow even tighter.



He set down his glass, picked up a financial magazine from the coffee table, and flipped it open, making it obvious he didn't want to talk about it anymore.



""They're a hassle."" He barely spared a word, his eyes still fixed on the magazine, as if those stock charts mattered more than anything I had to say.



Seconds passed, and the silence was so thick I could almost hear my heartbeat.



Just when I thought the conversation was over, he flipped a page without even looking up and threw out another offhand remark. ""And having one out of wedlock is even more trouble.""



His words felt like a knife dipped in ice, plunging straight into my heart.



I could almost feel the warmth draining from me, my whole body turning cold.



I opened my mouth, wanting to say something, but my throat was so tight, not a single word would come out.



In the end, I just forced a smile worse than tears. ""Oh, I was just asking, you know, kind of curious. What would you be like if you had a kid?""



He didn't respond, just kept his eyes glued to the magazine.



I slowly stood up. ""I'm a bit tired. I'm going to bed.""



Back in the bedroom, I buried myself under the covers, and finally, the tears I'd been holding back came pouring out.



'Don't cry, Sophia. Don't let him find out,' I told myself.



'What would a patron do if he found out his canary was pregnant? I didn't even dare imagine it,' I thought.



At that moment, that last bit of unrealistic fantasy I'd been clinging to shattered completely, not even a trace left.



I thought it was time to go.



\*\*\*\*\*



A few days later, the weekend rolled around. Edward had an important business forum to attend, so he was out the door at the crack of dawn.



Left alone in the empty apartment, the place felt even more suffocating than usual.



My bestie, Vivian Downton, texted me, asking if I wanted to go out shopping.



Vivian was pretty much the only person I could be truly honest with these past three years.



She was in pretty much the same boat as me, kept by another powerful man in Elarwyn.



As she liked to put it, ""We're just two lost birds blown to the same corner of the world. No need for introductions when fate brings us together.""



We met up at the swankiest mall in the city center.



Vivian had just scored a generous allowance from her sugar daddy, Jason Grant, and was in high spirits. She grabbed my hand and pulled me along, shopping from the ground floor all the way to the top.



""Sophia, what do you think of this dress?"" Vivian held up a champagne-colored slip dress, holding it up against me. ""This color would look gorgeous on you.""



I just shook my head, not feeling it at all. That wave of nausea was starting to creep up on me again.



Vivian noticed right away. ""What's up? You don't look so great.""



She set the dress aside, her eyes full of concern as she looked me over, then gently squeezed my wrist. ""Have you been skipping meals again?""



I was about to say I was fine when, out of the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of something, and my feet felt glued to the floor.



Not far away, in front of a newly opened custom suit shop, stood Edward. He was wearing a perfectly tailored dark gray suit, standing tall and sharp. 'Wasn't he supposed to be at that forum?' I thought.



But what really made my breath hitch was the woman standing next to him.



She was dressed in a well-fitted white dress, her long hair softly curled, giving off a gentle, elegant vibe. She was looking up at Edward, smiling, her eyes crinkling with her smile.



The sunlight poured through the mall's massive glass dome, bathing the two of them in a soft halo, making them look like they belonged together, almost like a perfect couple.



She wasn't his mother or his sister. She was a woman I'd never seen before.



Vivian followed my gaze, her face falling a little as she instinctively tried to pull me away.



The more Vivian tried to pull me away, the more uneasy I felt.



""Vivian, who is she?"" I grabbed Vivian's hand, staring straight into her eyes as I asked.



Vivian's gaze darted away, and she hesitated for a long moment. Only after I pressed her again and again did she finally lower her voice and say, ""I only heard a bit from Jason. That's Edward's first crush, Emily Monroe. She's a few years older than him and married overseas years ago. Just recently, she got divorced and moved back.""



'His first crush? What a joke,' I thought, the irony stinging.



A wave of sour heartache welled up inside me, so strong that it felt suffocating.



'I should be happy, right? The woman he really loves is back. Maybe now he'll finally let me go,' I told myself. 'I'm free now. But why does it hurt this much inside?'



""Sophia, are you okay?"" Vivian asked softly, her voice full of concern.



She watched me anxiously, gripping the edge of her sleeve so tightly her knuckles had gone pale.



I took a deep breath, forcing a smile and making my tone as breezy as I could. ""I'm fine, really. What could possibly be wrong? His first crush is back‚Äîgood for him. I was just the stand-in, after all. Now that she is here, it's only right for me to step aside.""



I said all the right things, but only I knew how much it hurt‚Äîlike someone was dragging a dull knife across my heart, one cut at a time.



""It was always just physical, never about feelings, right?"" I told her, forcing myself to sound calm.



Vivian let out a sigh, a bit of sadness flickering in her eyes.



'Yeah, who were we kidding? Caged canaries like us don't get to talk about love,' I wondered.



That afternoon, I just wasn't in the mood to shop anymore. I made up an excuse and parted ways with Vivian.



Instead of going home, I grabbed a cab and went straight to the hospital.



I checked in at the OB-GYN and sat on the cold waiting room bench, feeling like I was waiting for a verdict.



When I got the slip that said \[5 weeks pregnant,\] the world spun around me.



The slip of paper in my hand felt light as a feather, but somehow, it weighed a ton.



I walked out of the exam room in a daze, still reeling from this surprise, when I spotted the hospital director personally leading two people toward the VIP section of the OB-GYN department.



And those two people were Edward and Emily.



Emily was holding onto Edward's arm, her face lit up with a soft, gentle smile. Edward turned his head to listen to her, the faintest hint of a smile tugging at his lips.



The scene was so dazzling that it almost hurt to look at.



Before I knew it, I was trailing after them, hiding just around the corner in the hallway.



After about half an hour, they finally came out of the exam room.



Emily was holding her own test slip, giving it a little wave, her eyes shining brightly as she looked up at Edward.



They were a little too far away, and with the crowd and all the noise, I couldn't make out their conversation clearly.



But a few words pierced my ears like needles.



""This baby couldn't have come at a better time. It's the product of our love."" It was Edward's voice.



Emily's smile grew even brighter, and she excitedly hugged Edward's arm, clinging to him.



Edward was briefly taken aback, but then his features softened, and he reached up to gently pat her hand.



They looked like a perfect match, suited for each other in every way.



I slumped against the cold wall, feeling as if every ounce of strength had been drained from my body.



So, it turned out he didn't hate kids. He just couldn't stand the idea of having a child with me.



It was just because the mother wasn't the woman in his heart that he didn't want a baby and thought it was a hassle.



A sharp pain shot through my chest, my vision went black, and I almost fainted.



Luckily, someone caught me before I could fall. It was Vivian.



Vivian must have followed me at some point, but I hadn't even noticed.



""Sophia,"" Vivian called out, her voice trembling with worry.



She was on the verge of tears. ""Are you okay? Please, don't scare me like that.""



I just shook my head, unable to get a single word out.



My tears just wouldn't stop, falling like beads from a broken string.



Vivian helped me over to a chair and hugged me tight, cursing out Edward and Emily nonstop.



I heard her, but inside, I was just numb.



I was too naive. I never should've let myself hope for anything.



He only ever wanted my body, never my heart. Not once did he give me even a shred of real affection.

I had a root canal on this tooth (bottom left molar) about 5 years ago probably and have had nothing but problems since. I never fully experienced any period of time pain free, and have always had pain when eating on that side of my mouth.

The last couple of days bits of the tooth keep crumbling away and it‚Äôs a lot more sensitive than normal - mainly to heat than cold but I don‚Äôt really know what that means.

I‚Äôm meant to be waiting to have it extracted at the hospital with a couple of wisdom teeth but idk if I should make an appointment with my dentist sooner or if I should just suck it up and try power through. I rarely go to the dentist unless it‚Äôs an emergency appointment because I am terrified and so the fact that I‚Äôm considering going makes me think that it‚Äôs probably time to speak to the dentist. But the last time I had it x-rayed (probably 12-18 months ago) they said that they couldn‚Äôt really explain the ongoing pain and that extraction was probably the best way forward.

I‚Äôve had extractions before (both upper wisdom teeth) but I scare myself sh*tless any time I think about going for an appointment even though the last extractions weren‚Äôt horrific in the grand scheme of things. It would be nice to be able to eat that side of my mouth and drink a coffee without horrible pain I suppose ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§î",1,1758853268.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

After a few semesters here (and countless mall trips lol), here‚Äôs my personal Top 5 Malaysian souvenirs:

White Coffee ‚òïÔ∏è ‚Äì Ipoh is famous for it, but honestly you can find 3-in-1 packs anywhere, my Korean friends love it because it‚Äôs not too bitter, very smooth. It saves me a lot of time! I can sleep in and just grab one before class.

Shopping at Pavilion KL  ‚Äì The vibe here is very luxury but got everything under one roof. After shopping, I‚Äôll usually pick up some souvenirs like Legendary Perfume Malaysia ‚Äî I was surprised Malaysia got its own perfume brand inspired by legends like Mahsuri. Quite meaningful as a gift, feels very cultural instead of just buying the usual keychain. 

Batik Shirts & Scarves  ‚Äì Very colourful, unique designs. Not only the traditional cutting like baju melayu or cheongsam, they now turn batik to crop top and set wear! So, it's pretty versatile! My mom already reserved one for herself ü§≠.

Local Snacks  ‚Äì Kaya spread, dodol, muruku, or even kacang putih. Easy to pack and everyone can share. Remember to buy more than one! Last time my sister complained that I only bought one pack of kacang putih, which wasn‚Äôt enough. 

Handmade Crafts ‚Äì If you go to Central Market or Jonker Street, you can find nice handmade stuff that feels very local. That day I went to Ping Min Market and there is a shop selling Malaysian tiny snacks, it is so cute! 

For me, my ‚Äúfinal Malaysia gift set‚Äù will probably be: white coffee (for my friends), batik (for my mom), handmade crafts & kacang putih (for my sister) and the perfume (for myself hehe).

So I'm curious, what would you all buy as souvenirs?",0,1758853180.0,malaysia,4,0.5,False

A group of girls was there, about my age, if not a little older. They were all preppy girls that all went to the room at the end of the hall for some reason unknown to me. They were all joyful and energetic. I didn‚Äôt know them. I stood near the entrance. The girl was paying no attention to me, which I was fine with. I approached the black sofa, then suddenly stopped when I found a large, long-limbed version of Grimace (yes, the McDonald‚Äôs mascot), lying on the floor between the coffee table and the sofa, the corners of his mouth were curled downward in a frown, and his eyes were completely shut. He showed no sign of life. This was obviously out of the ordinary, but I showed no sign of shock. There was a small knife on the kitchen counter, and for no reason at all I went up to Grimace with this knife, stuck the whole blade in his body, and just as quickly took it back out, leaving a 2.5 inch deep hole right in the middle of his torso. I then turned the knife sideways in my hand, and I slid it across where I had to imagine his neck would be, the purple, synthetic cloth skin separating between the sliver. Even after all I had just done to him, no liquids of any kind came out of either slit. While the knife dragged along his throat, I felt a phantom tickle along mine, as if a ghost were trying to do the same to me. I took a few steps away, with the knife still in my hand, and stood, pacing around the other side of the room in complete silence, other than my footsteps. About 10 minutes later, the group of preppy girls comes out, all giggling and squealing and chatting loudly. I remained, pacing around the other side of the room, when I hear a shocked & fearful shriek. I turned towards the direction it came from, and a skinny white girl with blond hair from the group was looking down, with a petrified expression on her face. She looked away from the scene and up to me, knowing I was the culprit. Last thing I remember was me, just walking to another room with the knife still in my hand, and the group of girls now following me, hurling threats and slurs my way.

On Valentine's Day, Gabriella Watson spent 24 hours straight inside Fred W. Symmes Chapel, sitting in the same pew, clutching her rosary, whispering prayers until her voice went hoarse and her body ached.
She did it because her husband, Daniel Durke, and their son, Jerome Durke, claimed they weren't feeling well. They swore if she prayed hard enough, they'd start to feel better.
Exhausted, she caught a red-eye flight home. Midway through, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number. ""Your husband's marrying his stepsister today. Your son's the ring bearer.""
Gabriella rolled her eyes at the cruel prank and typed back, ""Impossible. My husband and son love me.""
But when she finally pulled up to the estate, she saw it with her own eyes‚ÄîDaniel, in a tux, sliding a ring onto his stepsister's finger as she stood radiant in a wedding dress.
Jerome clapped and grinned. ""Thia, now you're my real mom! I don't have to live with that naggy woman anymore!""
Gabriella felt the world tilt. The rosary slipped from her hand and scattered across the ground.
***
""You promised‚Äîif I wanted to, you'd take me away. Now, I'm willing to go with you.
""Gabriella, you can't take back what you said. Are you sure you don't want Daniel and Jerome?""
""Yes. I don't want them.""
Gabriella hung up. A few yards away, Daniel and Cynthia Moreau had just finished a heated kiss.
Her first instinct was to hide. She darted behind the rose wall, clenching her fist so tightly her skin throbbed with pain.
All this time, when she'd nearly ruined her body praying and stayed up through the night begging for the health of the people she loved, they were secretly throwing a lavish wedding for Cynthia.
The excuse about being ""unwell"" had been a lie. They'd been making a fool of her all along.
Most of the guests were Daniel's friends. Applause swelled around them.
""Man, Danny is so romantic. Seven or eight years apart and they get back together‚ÄîI'm tearing up.""
""Right? There's no blood between them. They were forced apart. Thia's had it rough. Thank God Danny stood by her, kicked Gabriella out, and made this huge wedding on Valentine's Day‚Äîso perfect.""
""Yeah. Danny might've cared for Gabriella, but she could never take Thia's place. Gabriella's petty, and she ruined her looks. It's no wonder her husband and son hate her. She just won't go away. What a manipulative woman.""
Every word landed like another blow. Gabriella felt her blood go cold.
The wedding march looped. Daniel held Cynthia, who was sobbing, and his eyes were softer than she'd ever seen.
""Thia, eight years. I finally get to do this‚Äîhave a dreamlike wedding with you.""
Cynthia choked back tears into his shoulder. ""Danny, I never thought I'd be with you again in my lifetime. All the suffering‚ÄîI can forget it now.""
Daniel's look was full of protectiveness. ""Don't worry. I'll take care of you. I'll protect you forever.""
Jerome grinned and hugged Cynthia's leg. ""Thia, can I call you 'Mom' now? You're getting married to my dad.""
Cynthia smiled softly and said, ""Yes, but keep it a secret from your mom, okay? If she finds out, I might get kicked out.""
Jerome's face hardened. ""Hmph. If she bullies you, I'll make her pay. I'll send her to the loony bin!""
Hot tears streaked down Gabriella's face. She couldn't believe it‚Äîthe son she raised would put his own mother in a psychiatric hospital for Cynthia.
Daniel grabbed the mic and warned the crowd, ""Please keep this between us. Gabriella is petty and holds grudges. I'm worried she might do something to Thia.""
""Don't worry, Danny. We're all backing you and Thia‚Äîour lips are sealed!"" someone called.
Cynthia gave a guilty look toward Daniel. ""She'll come after me if she knows.""
Daniel soothed her, ""I owe you this. I can't put your name on the marriage license, but I'll protect you. Gabriella won't dare touch you.""
""Dad and I will be your knights, Mom Thia. No one will make you sad!"" Jerome declared.
Then the crowd funneled into the estate's ballroom and started the opening dance.
Gabriella's legs gave out. She sank onto the lawn.
She remembered the first time she met Daniel‚Äîhe was a mess, living on cigarettes and booze, many times close to jumping into the river.
She'd brought him to therapy, taken care of him for two years, and handled everything until he had life in him again.
She knew there was someone else in his heart, so she stepped back and disappeared for a while.
Daniel had searched the world for her. He even waited outside the B&B she stayed at for three days, begging her to come back.
He'd poured his heart out. ""Gabriella, you gave me a second life. Marry me.""
She'd believed his sincerity and trusted he'd love her above all else.
They were married for six years and had Jerome.
She never expected that when Gabriella returned, Daniel would so quickly drift back to his first love.
Even her son wanted Cynthia as his mother more than he wanted her.
Her devotion had become a joke‚Äîdiscarded and despised like trash.
Gabriella's eyes were too dry for tears. She watched the sky fill with pink heart-shaped balloons and felt a hollow chill at how blatant Daniel's romance with Cynthia was.
At least in five days, she would disappear from this city for good‚Äîout of their sight, out of their problem.
Chapter 2
Gabriella was about to leave when someone stopped her.
""You‚Äîgo run the bath for the bride. After she showers, she's spending the night with Mr. Durke. Don't mess this up!""
It was one of the staff, treating Gabriella like a new hire.
She'd just come down from the mountain. The cold had cracked her face, so she'd bundled up tight to hide it, and no one recognized her as Daniel's wife.
She tried to refuse, but the worker grumbled and shoved her up to the second floor.
Every hallway was lined with Cynthia's portraits. Everywhere Gabriella looked there were camellias‚ÄîCynthia's favorite. That's when Gabriella realized just how far Daniel had gone to pamper someone else.
The wedding was lavish. Any woman would be jealous.
In the bathroom she moved on autopilot, filling the tub with hot water. Just outside, the suite was decked out for the honeymoon, and the thought of it made her cry again.
A giant wedding photo showed Daniel and Cynthia locked in a passionate kiss.
The thought hit her‚Äîwhile she'd been sick from the altitude, he'd been taking bridal photos with Cynthia.
While she'd been praying for his well-being, he'd been writing sappy vows to another woman.
Suddenly Daniel burst through the door with Cynthia in his arms. They couldn't even wait to get to the bed. They started making out in the entryway, tearing at each other's clothes.
The spray of water blurred the glass. Gabriella's hand tightened on the showerhead until it trembled.
Daniel's voice came out rough, thick with desire. ""Thia, I've waited for this day so long.""
Cynthia sounded a little crushed. ""But you still married Gabriella and had a child with her. I'm not blaming you‚ÄîI'm just... sad. Our first night isn't with each other.""
Daniel smiled, indulgent and soft. ""You know, back then I missed you so much. Gabriella showed up at the right time. She wasn't pretty like you, didn't flirt the way you do, and her voice wasn't as sweet, but she worked hard and treated me well. In the moment I thought trying it with her wasn't a loss.
""And our first time? It wasn't gentle. I was wasted, and I mistook her for you. You're the one I want‚Äîyou're irreplaceable.""
Cynthia's face lit up, and she kissed him eagerly.
Gabriella watched them through the frosted glass, feeling as if someone was cutting her open.
She remembered how Daniel once treated her like a treasure‚Äîcalling her his salvation, his love he couldn't turn away from.
Now, in front of Cynthia, she was the desperate fool.
He'd turned off the lights the first time, been tender but fierce at the same time, whispering, ""I love you. I want to have you forever.""
Only now did Gabriella realize his mind had been on Cynthia the whole time.
She wiped her face, kept her head down, and stepped out. ""Sir, the bath is ready. I'll be going.""
She squeezed out the words, not wanting to witness what would happen next.
They were down to the last scraps of clothing.
Daniel said in a low voice, ""From now on, call Gabriella 'Mrs. Durke.'""
Gabriella flinched, closed her eyes, and answered like someone resigned to a sentence, ""Yes, Mr. Durke and Mrs. Durke. Congratulations on your marriage.""
Cynthia laughed, all charm as she lounged on the bed. ""Danny, don't be so mean. She did witness the wedding‚Äîgive her something, a little tip.""
Daniel pounced and bit her lip playfully. ""Call me honey, not by my name.""
Gabriella stood frozen, hollow inside, as Daniel carelessly tossed a wristwatch at her.
""Take this downstairs. Serve the new Mrs. Durke well.""
Cynthia squealed. ""Isn't that the watch Gabriella designed herself for you? You're just giving it to a servant?""
Daniel chuckled. ""It's our wedding day‚Äîgive the staff a gift. Later we'll say it got lost. Gabriella won't make a fuss. She always brings me those random little presents. I can't treasure them all.""
Gabriella pressed the watch into her palm, numb. She pushed open the door and ran out.
They'd been together two Valentine's Days now. For three months she'd apprenticed with a craftsman to design and build that one-of-a-kind watch for Daniel.
He wore it everywhere afterwards‚Äîit was his profile pic, his show of affection. Friends teased him for being sentimental, and he loved it.
Now, on Valentine's Day, he'd tossed that watch to a servant like trash and crawled into bed with another woman.
Gabriella wandered the street in a daze and, when she couldn't bear it anymore, hurled the watch into a roadside trash can‚Äîalong with the foolish, naive version of herself she'd once been.
Chapter 3
By the time Gabriella got home, she was soaked from the downpour, her body burned with a terrifying fever.
In the living room, Jerome was glued to his game console‚Äîthe latest model, a gift from Cynthia.
""Why are you back so soon?""
His tone wasn't concerned for her health. It was a surprise that she'd returned early, worrying it might interrupt his dad and new mom's wedding night.
Gabriella blinked, slightly dazed. ""Yeah... I just got back. I'm going to rest.""
Jerome froze. Normally, she would never let him stay up late gaming. But tonight, she hadn't even taken the console.
He settled in comfortably on the floor, diving into his game with full intensity.
Gabriella set the two rosaries on the coffee table and turned toward the stairs.
""Running all the way there just to bring back this? Is this supposed to make me and Dad feel better? Looks cheap... not even close to the full gaming setup Thia got me.""
Even though Jerome spoke softly, she heard every word.
This time, she didn't respond. She went straight to her room, curling under the covers to warm her freezing body.
That night was filled with nightmares. Gabriella almost thought she wouldn't wake up.
When she did, Daniel's worried face hovered over her. ""Honey, you're awake! You scared me to death.
""Why'd you come back early from the mountains? Why didn't you call me to pick you up? Look at you‚Äîforty-degree fever! I nearly went weak at the knees hearing this.""
Gabriella listened to his tender tone, tasting only bitter irony.
Now she could see through Daniel's fake mask straight into the rot underneath.
""I thought sleeping it off would help. It's nothing serious,"" she said evenly.
""Nothing serious? What if something happened to you? What about Jerome?
""I'll take care of you these days. Don't even think about getting out of bed.""
His tone was indulgent yet scolding, impossible to read.
Soon, a rosary fell from his hands. ""I saw this on the coffee table. You got it for me and Jerome, right? I've heard these are powerful but hard to get. You went through so much‚ÄîI love you.
""I made sure Jerome always carries his, and I'll do the same. Never losing it. It's all your effort.""
Gabriella's voice went cold. ""What about the watch I gave you?""
Daniel was caught off guard, but his expression stayed smooth. ""It's at the office. My assistant's holding it for me.""
Gabriella's lashes flickered. She didn't push further, letting her question hang in the air like a trap.
Daniel leaned down to kiss her forehead. She turned away in disgust, the memory of him kissing Cynthia flashing through her mind.
His kiss missed, freezing him for a split second.
""What? Feeling unwell? I can call a doctor.""
""I'm fine. Just a little dizzy. I want to sleep,"" she said, closing her eyes, making it clear she didn't want to continue the conversation.
Daniel brushed it off, assuming her reaction was just the illness.
Then the phone rang. Jerome's voice came through, ""Dad! Mom passed out! Come quick!""
""What happened? I'm on my way! Tell her not to be afraid!""
Daniel bolted, unaware that every word of his earlier conversation had been heard by Gabriella.
Chapter 4
That afternoon, Gabriella got out of bed to handle her discharge paperwork.
The doctor gave her an unexpected blow.
""Ms. Watson, you're already over three weeks pregnant. I recommend staying a few more days to rest‚Äîthere's been some signs of a threatened miscarriage.""
Gabriella stared blankly at the report. Pregnant? Now?
Turning a corner, she caught a familiar voice.
""Mom Thia, you're having a baby, right? Yay! I'll be the best brother ever!
""Dad, are you so happy you're acting silly?""
Cynthia gently tugged at Daniel's cheek. ""Did you hear? The doctor said you're going to be a dad.""
Daniel's eyes were red, and he hurriedly scooped Cynthia into his arms.
""I love you, Thia. Thank you for bringing this life into the world. I'll love you both without reservation.""
The report slipped from Gabriella's hand and fluttered to the floor.
She was pregnant at the same time as Cynthia. How absurd.
She didn't even need to ask Daniel what he thought. She couldn't keep this baby.
And she feared that, like Jerome, the baby would hate her, wanting another woman as their mother.
Gabriella turned back and scheduled a procedure with the doctor for a few days later.
That night, Daniel finally returned home, drenched in sweat.
He dropped to one knee, taking Gabriella's cold hand. ""I had to run into the office for something urgent, and when I got back, you'd already discharged yourself. You rushed home while still sick... Don't scare me like that, okay?""
Gabriella's expression was blank as she stared at the floor. ""I'm fine now. Staying in the hospital was uncomfortable, so I came back.""
Daniel's unease eased slightly, though he still probed. ""Did something happen on the way? You seem off lately.""
""Nothing. You're overthinking.""
He was about to speak again, but Gabriella buried herself in her phone.
""I'll make you a pot of seafood chowder,"" Daniel said. ""You probably haven't had much appetite with the cold. This will be good for you.""
Rolling up his sleeves, he went into the kitchen, preparing the meal with practiced ease.
Gabriella remembered when Daniel had only drunk alcohol and refused to eat‚Äîshe had gone to endless lengths to get him to eat, including making this chowder.
Once he learned how, he'd started making it for her anytime he could.
Back then, she had thought their love could last a lifetime.
Her phone chimed‚ÄîJerome had dragged a ""reluctant"" Cynthia into the house.
""Jerry, don't do that. Your mom's sick. Your dad's taking care of her; that's his job. I can't be here‚Äîyour mom wouldn't like it.""
""Why wouldn't she? I want you here, so you're here! With Dad and me protecting you, she won't dare kick you out!""
Normally, Cynthia wouldn't have dared to show up at Gabriella and Daniel's home so boldly.
This time, her confidence came from the baby in her belly.
Jerome shoved Cynthia onto the couch, sticking his tongue out at Gabriella like a defiant child. ""I want Thia to play with me. You can't kick her out!""
Cynthia smiled, her expression unreadable. ""Sorry, Gabriella. I'll just stay a little while, then I'll go. Don't want to ruin Jerry's fun.""
Gabriella snapped back sharply. ""If you didn't want to come, why can't you let go of my son? Cynthia, you've been waiting for this day a long time, huh? All that pretending‚ÄîI'm exhausted just watching.""
Cynthia wasn't expecting Gabriella's bluntness and hesitated, unsure how to respond.
Then she leaned back lazily. ""Gabriella, the bathwater was perfect. We even lingered in the tub after.""
Gabriella's stiffened, frozen in place. She realized that night Cynthia had known the servant was her all along and deliberately made Daniel reward her, humiliating her on purpose.
Daniel came out carrying the chowder. Sensing the tension, he quickly defended Cynthia.
""Honey, Jerry likes Thia. She's just here to play with him. Don't overthink it.
""And she wanted to see how you're feeling, just chat a bit.""
Gabriella ignored his half-hearted explanation, turning toward the stairs. ""It's fine. You guys do what you want. I need to rest.""
Daniel didn't notice her mood anymore. His attention was entirely on Cynthia.
From downstairs, laughter and chatter floated up. Gabriella stared into the distance, calculating the time until she could finally leave.
Chapter 5
The next day, Gabriella went into the office.
The HR manager looked at her, hesitating. ""Ms. Watson, are you sure you want to resign? The CEO doesn't know yet. He didn't pay attention when he signed. I can still‚Äî""
""I'm sure. I'm resigning. His signature's enough,"" she said.
After finishing a quick handover, she started packing up her office.
Everywhere she looked were little gifts from Daniel, matching mugs, soft seat cushions, a pair of matching keyboards, even framed family photos...
Memories of happiness slowly turned to ash in her hands.
Suddenly, the HR manager ran in, panic written all over her face. ""Ms. Watson, you need to check the company website. Something's happened...""
Gabriella pulled it up and froze. At the top of the homepage, a scandalous headline screamed, ""Cynthia Moreau's Nude Photo Leak"".
The images were brutal. Cynthia, disheveled, was surrounded by strangers forcing her to drink, striking her, and pulling at her clothes.
A video played below, showing her being humiliated over and over.
""Who would post this?"" Gabriella muttered to herself.
It was clearly a relic from Cynthia's time abroad.
There was no way she'd do this herself.
Gabriella was about to leave when Daniel appeared, carrying a sobbing Cynthia.
The first words out of his mouth were like a knife to her chest. ""Gabriella, this was you, wasn't it?""
Gabriella felt her blood turn cold. Her voice came out strained. ""Daniel, do you actually think I did this?""
His eyes cut into her like a blade, piercing her already aching heart.
""You just got to the office, and this happens. How am I supposed to believe you?""
He had someone bring up security footage‚Äîshowing her going to talk to her assistant, Linda Davis.
Gabriella tried to explain. ""I just gave Linda some instructions on the next steps for work.""
Then Linda walked in, head down. Facing Daniel, she said, ""Ms. Watson asked me to post the photos and videos... said she wanted Cynthia to be humiliated, to make everyone despise her.""
Gabriella screamed, furious. ""Linda! I never told you to do that!""
She couldn't believe the person she trusted most at work had betrayed her.
Daniel snatched the family photo from her desk and smashed it to the floor, fury radiating off him.
""Gabriella! How dare you go after Thia like this! You know how I feel about her growing up abroad, how I hated that I wasn't there to protect her. And now... you've destroyed her again!""
Cynthia collapsed in his arms, crying so hard she was almost fainting.
""Danny, I stayed clean! I didn't let anyone touch me! And now... the whole world thinks I was violated. How am I supposed to live?""
""Why do you hate me so much, Gabriella? I'm barely surviving, and this... is this what you wanted?""
Gabriella stared at the obvious trap and let out a hollow, bitter laugh.
In Daniel's eyes, her innocence meant nothing compared to Cynthia's tears.
At that moment, Jerome stormed in, furious. ""You're so cruel! Why would you post Thia's photos? You're a terrible woman! And you'll pay for hurting her!""
Before Gabriella could react, Jerome grabbed a vase from the desk and smashed it into her head.
""Apologize to Thia!"" he shouted.
Gabriella couldn't dodge. The vase hit her square on the forehead, blood gushing down past her eyes.
""Ms. Watson!"" the HR manager gasped, too shocked to move closer.
Daniel froze for a second too, but seeing innocent Cynthia in his arms, his face hardened again.
This was what Gabriella deserved. He couldn't show mercy‚Äîshe needed to learn her lesson.
""Apologize. A sincere apology to Thia,"" Daniel said coldly.
Dizzy and bleeding, Gabriella's last sight before collapsing was Daniel's smug satisfaction‚Äîand her son looking up at Cynthia, waiting for praise for his righteous judgment.
Chapter 6
When Gabriella woke up, she was plunged into darkness.
The blood on her forehead had dried, crudely bandaged like someone had half-heartedly cared.
Voices came from outside the room‚ÄîDaniel's voice.
""Thia, you didn't deserve that. I never expected Gabriella to treat you that way, leaking your photos. But she's still my wife. I can't just throw her in jail.""
""So your plan is to starve her for a few days as punishment? Honestly, I'm fine... I'm used to being pushed around. I can handle it.""
""Don't be ridiculous. No one is allowed to hurt you anymore. Not even Gabriella.""
Then, Jerome started scheming. ""Why don't we lock her up from now on? Chains or something? That way, she can't hurt anyone again.""
Gabriella felt her heart freeze. She stared blankly at the ceiling. Her own son wanted to chain her up. The words cut her deeper than any knife.
Daniel's voice cut sharply. ""Jerry, that's your mother. What are you even saying?""
Then, his tone softened as he turned to comfort Cynthia. ""If Gabriella keeps acting out, I'll put her in one of the vacant apartments outside town. Someone will watch her, and you can focus on bringing our baby into the world safely.
""To make sure she can't run off, I'll have a doctor give her something to keep her asleep most of the time. She won't be able to hurt anyone.""
Cynthia sniffled, deeply touched. ""Thank you, honey.""
Jerome clapped excitedly. ""Yes! Then I don't have to see her every day. Heck yeah!""
And just like that, Gabriella became a walking corpse. Days without food or water left her barely standing.
Daniel put her in the car. Cynthia sat in the passenger seat as they drove out of the city.
His voice was cold, emotionless. ""Gabriella, when you've thought things through, I'll come get you. This time, you went too far. Thia didn't press charges, so you should at least be grateful.""
Gabriella ignored him, closing her eyes, sinking into a deep, exhausted sleep.
Cynthia feigned kindness. ""Gabriella, we'll come see you often.""
Daniel chuckled. ""Gabriella, maybe you should take a page from Thia's book‚Äîlearn to be more forgiving.""
""Ugh... Daniel, you're disgusting.""
Suddenly, a truck came barreling toward them. Daniel barely had time to react, yanking the wheel hard.
In the last second before impact, he threw himself over Cynthia without a thought.
The deafening crash shook the world around them. Gabriella felt a sharp pain in her abdomen, the slow, terrifying slip of life from her body.
Bystanders gathered, sirens blared.
Through the haze, she saw Daniel cradling unconscious Cynthia, shouting for help.
""Someone save my wife! She's pregnant!""
All three were rushed into the ambulance. Daniel never once looked at Gabriella.
At the hospital, a nurse's urgent voice cut through the chaos. ""There's only one OR. Who goes in first?""
""My wife‚Äîshe's carrying our baby!"" Daniel shouted.
The nurse hesitated. ""The other woman is pregnant too. What do we do?""
He glanced at Gabriella, pale and fragile, realizing she was pregnant as well.
Less than a second later, he carried Cynthia into the only operating room. ""Save her first. Let's deal with the rest later.""
Gabriella watched the doors close, leaving Daniel's resolute back behind.
Weak, she closed her eyes. Time blurred until someone finally wheeled her away.
When she woke again, the doctor told her the baby was gone.
No sorrow. No joy. She pushed herself out of bed and insisted on leaving.
Passing a room, she saw Daniel meticulously helping Cynthia with her recovery.
Jerome held Cynthia's hand, crying. ""Mom Thia, please wake up soon.""
She glanced one last time before taking the elevator down.
Gabriella dialed a number. ""I'm ready. Come get me.""
Half an hour later, she slid into a limited-edition stretch Lincoln and vanished from the hospital, leaving Daniel and Jerome's world behind forever.
That night, Daniel smoked alone in the lounge when his phone rang.
""Mr. Durke, this is the New York City PD. Your wife, Gabriella Watson, drove off a bridge this afternoon. We haven't recovered the body yet. Can you come to the scene?""
At the same time, a doctor, grave-faced, pushed through the door. ""Mr. Durke, Gabriella is your wife, right? She just had a car accident and lost the baby. How could she leave the hospital on her own? She needs to rest properly, or she may never be able to have children again.""
The cigarette dropped from Daniel's hand. A thunderous noise rang in his mind.

1nqphpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1nqphpl/wtf/,Wtf,"So, I (24m) had a date monday with a girl I met the week earlier, I was stressed like crazy and was really afraid to see her cause, well, she's way out of my leagues. Anyway, I pick her up 2:30 at her place and we go to one of the swimming place around the city where we are. We agreed on that the day before so no surprise there. The day before the date, she texts me that she isn't going great cause her ex was being an absolute a**. So I do my best to cheer her up and tell her that i'll make her feel better when I'll see her. Anyway, we arrive at the creek, and quickly we get really close to each other, she kisses me, we go further so we can be alone, make out, I take a piece of her swimsuit off (with her explicit consent ofc)... Then she was getting cold so we got out and went on the edge of the creek to look at the water, turtles and fishes... Then, it's around 5:30pm and I ask her if she wants to see the sunset on one the hills. So we go, i have my hand on her thigh during the ride, she puts hers on my shoulder, we sing Billy Eilish together, we discover we actually have a 10y gap (she's 10 years older). I ask if it's a problem to what she says no so I ask for a kiss (she gives it to me) and we make our way to the sunset. I take a sweater so she doesn't get cold and we go to one of the point of view. We are holding each other closely and talking about everything... Then she starts laughing at me so I ask her why, apparently my personality is funny, so I ask her if it's because i'm resisting a lot to not undress her (at this point I sorta did it a bit earlier so it didn't seemed inappropriate to me) to what she tells me ""who says I'm interested ?"". After all that, I'm just thinking that hell yeah she was interested until now ? I ask her what it means (she was just messing with me) and it shifts towards a more serious conversation.  She talks to me about the previous people she was seeing, some wild stuff, the ex that was being an a** and how it all affected her and her insecurities. So I'm like, hugging her and telling her I'm sorry she went through all that, and that she absolutely don't deserve to be treated this way. She seemed pleased with me cheering her up so I'm kinda happy to see her smile. I say that I also went through some shit (hence why I've been in rghosting for a bit). She doesn't ask any questions about it, kinda felt like she didn't care. Then she asks me if I want to go take a bite or a coffee so we make our way to a place she likes. I say yes, off we go. We get a coffee and a pizza, she pays for the pizza, I offer to pay my share but she declines. After we decide to have a walk along the city's waterfront and she wants to go to a place she was supposed to visit to live there. We make our way there we talk on the way, then it's 8:30 so I go to drop her at her place. On the way we talk about seeing each other the Thursday, (so yesterday) and that she would let me know. We arrive at her place, we kiss (a lot) and tells me how much of a good time she had and thanked me. Then she goes home. I drive home and I send her a message like I really had a good time. She replies in the morning (Tuesday) saying the same. I send her a message and have no response till the morning after. Needless to say I wasn't very calm cause, in my experience when she starts texting you once a day the ghosting isn't far. Then she replies the next morning, telling me she is was with her friends all day and that she's going out of town, and this weekend she goes on an Island camping with her two girl bestfriend. Since she told me Wednesday morning that she was going out I haven't heard from her since. I see her reposting stuff on instagram but she doesn't open my messages. We were supposed to see each other yesterday but haven't heard from her. I am miserable and I make no illusion that I'm being ghosted. I don't understand. Anyway, if you have questions ask respectfully, also, I wouldn't mind some cheering up as I'm really about to fkg crash out. Everytime I put myself out there it ends up the same, ghosting, when I see a girl everything goes great, literally magnetic, but then I never see her again. I'm so confused, I can I keep trusting when everything they never do what they say. I don't hate women, just the way they make me feel, small, unwanted, unworthy of even being alive.. I'm such an idiot for keeping to out myself out there.. what's the point anymore.
