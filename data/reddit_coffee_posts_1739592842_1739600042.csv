The girl is model-level beautiful, very skinny, great style. But we've been friends for years and have a lot of interests in common. We are both 16.

 I was at a party tonight and the group was discussing dating and she said she didn't think anyone had ever had a crush on her and everyone just laughed a little to be polite, but then she turned to me and said ""I was hoping you'd prove me wrong"" well since it seemed she wanted me to, I asked her out for Monday and she said yes.

The problem is, I didn't use the word ""date"" when I asked her- I just asked if she'd let me take her out for coffee, so I'm worried she doesn't actually have any interest in me and only wanted me to tell her if I knew anyone who liked her, not that she was implying she wanted me to like her. Since we're friends maybe she doesn't think it's a date. 

Should I just cancel? Is it wrong to date her if it would prevent her from dating people in her own league? The only thing that might make a difference is it will be her first date (she's extremely socially awkward, and though it doesn't bother me at all it bothers a lot of kids at school) and I've had two previous relationships so maybe that brings us a little closer to even?

I would use my hour lunch to take a break and clear my head by playing a little bit of Baldurs Gate 3 and hanging out with my kitty of 14 years. When I was normally greeted by happy meows and chirps from my cat Lily, instead I was greeted by fire trucks, police tape, and my entire life in ash. Turns out, the night before, shortly after saying goodbye to my kitty and giving her treats and pets,  I left for my girlfriend's house (also named Lily, I call them my bouqet) the ex of the tennant above me decided to get revenge on him by pushing in my window ac unit, dumping gas all over my couch and my thousands of magic the gathering cards on the coffee table, and igniting the life I had just began building with the love of my life and the kitten that helped me get through so much since my early teens. 

I wasn't able to get closer than 5 feet from the front door as it was an active crime scene with the ohio fire marshal conducting his investigation. The first thing I asked was what about my cat? Please tell me she survived. She had not, luckily not touch by the flame, but taken by the smoke. I was her person, the only one she ever really bonded with, and I will never be able to forgive the guilt of not being there for her final moments. Lily was a 1 year old cranky old lady. One of those cats that you know will live to 20 out of sheer spite for the world. She came alive when she became a one animal house cat, I was even able to hold her without losing copious amounts of blood. She was my light, she was my little girl, and she was adopted so fast by my girlfriend Lily. Every time I snuggled with them, or human Lily annoyed cat Lily with love, I could not believe how much it made my heart soar. Now, my little girl is a box of ash and bag of hair on my shelf, her paw print receiving a place of reverence on the christmas tree this year. These things provide none of the warmth and love of my old kitten, but I swear I still feel her hop up on the bed as I'm waking up, ready for treats and love and to yell at me as I leave for work. 

While things are ultimately replaceable, everything I had was lost in the fire. Cherished bits and bobs that wove a tapestry of some of my best times and memories. Two of my grandpa's hats next to the signed album of my favorite band who I met while wearing his ""super grandpa"" hat which had the band laughing and striking up conversation with me. The teal Gameboy color my grandparents gave me and one of the only things I had of them. All of my magic the gathering and DND materials that I used to take my friends to far off worlds and wage epic battles together. My 3d printers that I used to literally shape the world around me. T shirts and clothes from countless trips made by myself or others. Things that I was able to look at and have them take me back to some happy time or joyous memory.  

Renters insurance covered a bit, at least a bed and necessities, but I was also forced to take time off work to process the grief caused by this event. I decided to continue this leave and officially resign to become a substitute teacher while working on my second bachleors degree in teaching. In the mean time, I started door dashing to cover my bills. I loved this, and was making the same money I was before, but ended up having to take out a loan to cover rebuilding expenses. I have a 2000 jeep cherokee that I call donkey and loved driving around doing deliveries and listening to podcasts. I was happy, I was making good money, and I was finally starting to feel stable again. I pleaded with the universe, please, do not take this jeep from me. I love my car, it doesn't matter what make or model or how old. It was always my safe space while living at home and the freedom and autonomy my car represents means so much to me and my mental health. I was told the cherokee engine from this era was unkillable. Well, I guess I find bad luck like a squirell finds a nut. What I thought was a cracked intake manifold turned out to be a total engine failure. Not only was this a stop to my income, it was a loss of the final bit of my old life that I was desperately clinging to. 


This was the final straw on the camel's back that was my mental health. I struggled with chronic depression and incredibly self destructive thoughts for so long. Then, at the end of 2023, I finally got it under control and began living my life as I wanted to. As someone who is stable enough to be a smile for anyone who needs it. This random arson attack from someone I had never even seen before in passing made me backslide into my old state of mind. While I still see life as worth more than anything and I still retain my dreams for human Lily and I's future, I'm at rock bottom in my hope of climbing back up out of this valley. 

And now we come to today. I took a semester off to focus on myself and rebuild, but I am now stuck without any idea of what direction to head. I'm ready to start being a substitute teacher, but I have no transportation to get there. Because of the loan I had to take, I am not approved for the financing on the engine swap, totaling around $6200. I can afford the payments, but can't get approved for them. In a spiraling pit of despair, I thought ""maybe a reddit community could help"". A thought i laughed off, but one that stuck with me. I am reaching out now desperate for help and at the bottom of the barrell of options. Please help me repair my car so I can return to stability, and continue my dream of educating the next generation. I am attaching the link to a go fund me my sister set up and the police report as well. If you could please share the go fund me link on a social media account, or help directly, I can finally get my life back on track. Thanks

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bi46md/a_friend_29m_has_made_a_serious_accusation/)  **Apr 27, 2019**

I don't know what to think. The situation is that a buddy I've known for a few years who is dating another friend of mine has informed me that my girlfriend that I've known for 8 months is lying about her occupation. He is an EMT and she claims to be a nurse at a certain hospital in our city. EMT buddy swears up and down there is no way she works there.

This is really shocking to me. She's in scrubs all of the time, I've picked her up from the hospital she claims to work at, she has medical books all over her apartment etcetera.

EMT buddy and my girlfriend have only met once on a double date with my other friend. They did talk shop a little bit and he's basing this accusation on that one conversation. He told me he would bet money she had never stepped foot on the ward she claims to work in. For reference, she says she's a psych nurse at this prestigious hospital and EMT buddy asked her which unit she worked on. Apparently there are two at this hospital, the ""East"" and ""West"" unit. He tested her by asking ""do you work on ""North"" or ""south"" and she said, ""north"" and that she referred to patients being violent as a ""code grey"" and that is not the terminology used at that hospital. There were more small, technical details he claimed she got wrong like their nurse's stations being open and not enclosed spaces. Things like that.

On one hand, why would she lie about being a nurse? But also what does he gain from lying about her lying about being a nurse? I don't know jack about the medical profession, to be frank. This whole thing makes me feel crazy.

How do I even bring this up?

TLDR EMT friend has called out my girlfriend as pretending to be a nurse.

**degeneratescholar**

>You can easily look up her license status by googling Nursing license verification in your state, then simply enter her name. It will tell you what kind of license she has and how long she's been licensed in your state. If she doesn't hold a license, you have a starting point for conversation. Many people who work in healthcare facilities wear scrubs - it doesn't mean they have any direct care responsibilities. Also, she would be required to have a photo ID with her credentials listed on it. You can settle the question by asking to see her name badge.

**notthatplatypus**

>>This is exactly it. I‚Äôm literally looking up my nursing professors now, and I can find all of their licenses.

>>Also, how has she said that she‚Äôs gotten her nursing degree? Did she do a bachelor‚Äôs program or an associate‚Äôs? Like, you should be able to ask to ‚Äòsee‚Äô her degree, and she should have a copy.

>>You could also ask to see her graduation pin! Nurses go through a pinning ceremony at the end of their time in school, and most people keep their pins.

>>I think she‚Äôs lying to you because she sees ‚Äúprestige‚Äù in being a nurse. Nurses are considered the most trusted professionals in the US. you‚Äôve definitely seen those sappy bumper stickers and memes about how nurses are angels. We all have.

>>She will 100% try to tell you that that phone call today led to you not finding her because of privacy regulations(she may even say it‚Äôs ‚Äúbecause of HIPAA‚Äù). Ask to see her badge. Ask for her license number. If she tries to claim that she doesn‚Äôt have these things, she‚Äôs making excuses. Your badge literally taps you in to different hospital wings and elevators, and some places even let you use yours to tap into the charting system.

>>>She told me she has a BSN. I can't find that she's licensed in our state.

I wouldn't doubt that if you've picked her up from work and she DOES ACTUALLY WORK THERE, she's a tech or something, and was lying to seem prestigious.

>>>>>Ooh, she talks so much shit about techs. I think she'd rather die than cop to being a tech.

**notthatplatypus**

>What kind of medical books does she have in her house? Like, Gray's Anatomy, or like, ""Honan Focus on Adult Health: Medical-Surgical Nursing 2nd Edition""? Are they books to make her look fancy, or books she may have used in school? ""Medical Books"" is pretty generic.

I thought maybe she goes by a different name, so I started to describe her and the lady got upset and told me she had to go. I guess she thought I was fucking with her. I don't know what to think.

**Wanderinground**

>>>>>Damn.. that's going to be a hard conversation. Be prepared to get backlash and redirection, stick to the point, she's lying and for what reason. It sounds like the end of a relationship. Can you imagine what would have happened if there was a genuine medical emergency, a very scary thought.

**OOP Update the original post next day/Apr 28, 2019**

UPDATE: Well this chick is batshit insane. Mystery solved. She doesn't work at the nice hospital, she works at a not so nice hospital and not as a nurse but as a phlebotomy technician or whatever the fuck. She failed out of nursing school and is seriously obsessed. She said she got a TBI her third year into her bachelors program and was unable to finish. I may have forgiven all of that but it's clear she has a tenuous, at BEST, grasp on reality and went on a bizarre rant about how she could be a doctor, how she saves lives, she's a genius; she knows more than anyone in the world when it comes to the medical field, she claimed she could perform surgery on people, that she had healing powers, that she's the greatest person in the world, just on and on... seriously unhinged type shit. I had to tap out because she was really scaring me.

I've never been in such close proximity to someone having a mental breakdown. I wasnt supposed to see her until yesterday and I ambushed her at her apartment. Finally I just had to leave. I feel bad about confronting her. I probably shouldn't have left her alone at all after that.


[AITA for contacting my ex girlfriend's estranged relatives to handle her?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/CuoNAOEHGj)  **May 3, 2019**

This is a really long story that I must condense for character limit. I hope the sense of it all is intact.

My ex girlfriend deceived me for our entire relationship. She told me she was a very important charge nurse with a BSN and worked at a prestigious hospital in our area. Here in reality she is not a nurse at all but a phlebotomy technician and not at a prestigious hospital either. 

She had a total breakdown when I confronted her about all of this and ended up getting put on an involuntary psych hold. I do not know how she did it, but she got herself released after only 2 days and is completely off the rails. She broke into my house. I came home from work the other day and she was in my shower. Not taking a shower, just chilling in there with my cat. It really fucking freaked me out. She ran off before the cops came. They couldn't find her. 

She moved here a few months before we started dating and I didn't know any of her family. After she broke into my house, I did some internet sleuthing and tracked down her parents and older brother. I was able to make contact with her mom because they have a landline with a listed number. I told her the situation. I gave her all of the information I knew about my ex. Her mom thanked me very much. Apparently my ex went ghost on her family about a year ago. Her mom told me they would take care of it and just wanted her to come back home. 

Her brother called me very frantic shortly after I got off the phone with their mom and I talked to him for awhile. He said he was flying out first thing to hunt my ex down. That was yesterday. I was satisfied and relieved with the response.

I spoke to some friends today about it and they think I did too much and shouldn't have involved her family because I don't know the dynamic. They could be abusive and got ghosted for good reason my good friend said. Honestly, I didn't think about that at the time and now I feel shitty.

We first matched on hinge in December, right after Christmas. I really enjoyed the first date but it took almost a month to plan because of how spaced out our texts were. We had dinner and drinks. He stood out among all the other guys I‚Äôve gone out with. I felt like he was really thoughtful in planning the date. He picked places based on things I said I liked and things that were close to me but out of the way for him in terms of distance. He really listened to me when I talked. I mentioned something kind of personal/stressful I had gone through with work. And I was like but I don‚Äôt want to dwell on that right now. And he said no, it‚Äôs okay. I don‚Äôt mind and reached across the table to hold my hand. I don‚Äôt know, it felt very sweet. After the date, he walked me to my car and kissed me. He was like I was thinking about that all night. And he kissed me under these lights, it felt like a movie. I felt giddy afterwards. Then, he went out of town so our next date wasn‚Äôt scheduled for two weeks. And, there was a snowstorm the day of so I texted him to see if he wanted to cancel. We both agreed we still wanted to go out to this movie I suggested. He held my hand the entire time, we kissed on this date again, but we had to end after that because of the weather. So I think our mutual willingness to go and see each other when we live like 30 minutes away from one another in 6 inches of snow means we like each other. And we planned a third date. 

But the texting is so bad. Like 
day 1, do you want to go out? ‚ÄúYes‚Äù 
day 2 ‚Äúwould u prefer coffee or drinks? ‚ÄúDrinks‚Äù day 3 what night are you free? 

That‚Äôs how bad it is. After our second date, I put my dating profile on pause because I did feel hopeful about our connection but honestly I‚Äôve been getting a ton of dates and was feeling burnt out meeting new people. So now that my focus is more on him, I‚Äôm more aware of his lack of responsiveness. I mentioned it after the second date that I‚Äôd like him to respond quicker so it‚Äôs easier to make plans. And he said yeah sorry, I‚Äôm just not good at texting. My experience tells me that‚Äôs always a lie. Whenever a guy is interested, he texts. You don‚Äôt have to question his interest because of lack of texts. Like a guy who likes you, you will never be confused about. Part of me feels like I should end it because the fact that I care about it at all shows I‚Äôm already emotionally involved on some level. And I‚Äôd rather end early before actually getting hurt. But on the other hand. Both dates are great, we agreed to go out. I‚Äôm like why end it when things are going well in person? But I really don‚Äôt want to be hurt. At my age 27, I see every date I spend with the wrong person as delaying meeting the right person. So that‚Äôs why I normally cut things off sooner rather than later if they‚Äôre not a good fit. But my dating burnout is bad enough (i went on dates with about 8 people in the past 2 months) that I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs wasting time because I need a break from meeting new people anyway. Just really don‚Äôt want to be hurt again. ",1,1739598329.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I have a 2000 jeep cherokee that I call donkey and loved driving around doing deliveries and listening to podcasts. I was happy, I was making good money, and I was finally starting to feel stable again. I pleaded with the universe, please, do not take this jeep from me. I love my car, it doesn't matter what make or model or how old. It was always my safe space while living at home and the freedom and autonomy my car represents means so much to me and my mental health. I was told the cherokee engine from this era was unkillable. Well, I guess I find bad luck like a squirell finds a nut. What I thought was a cracked intake manifold turned out to be a total engine failure. Not only was this a stop to my income, it was a loss of the final bit of my old life that I was desperately clinging to. 


This was the final straw on the camel's back that was my mental health. I struggled with chronic depression and incredibly self destructive thoughts for so long. Then, at the end of 2023, I finally got it under control and began living my life as I wanted to. As someone who is stable enough to be a smile for anyone who needs it. This random arson attack from someone I had never even seen before in passing made me backslide into my old state of mind. While I still see life as worth more than anything and I still retain my dreams for human Lily and I's future, I'm at rock bottom in my hope of climbing back up out of this valley. 

And now we come to today. I took a semester off to focus on myself and rebuild, but I am now stuck without any idea of what direction to head. I'm ready to start being a substitute teacher, but I have no transportation to get there. Because of the loan I had to take, I am not approved for the financing on the engine swap, totaling around $6200. I can afford the payments, but can't get approved for them. In a spiraling pit of despair, I thought ""maybe a reddit community could help"". A thought i laughed off, but one that stuck with me. I am reaching out now desperate for help and at the bottom of the barrell of options. Please help me repair my car so I can return to stability, and continue my dream of educating the next generation. I am attaching the link to a go fund me my sister set up and the police report as well. If you could please share the go fund me link on a social media account, or help directly, I can finally get my life back on track. Thanks!

1ipusts,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ipusts/mf_no_questions/,[MF] No Questions,"Tina arrived for her shift at 6:00 AM sharp, clutching her usual Styrofoam cup of gas station coffee and regretting every decision that had led to her still working at the Gas ‚Äôn Go Emporium.

She was not in the mood for whatever nonsense Barry had likely been up to overnight.

Unfortunately, as soon as she stepped behind the counter, she immediately saw the problem.


-

Above the register, a new sign had been perfectly mounted to the wall.

It read:

""NO QUESTIONS.""

Tina stared at it.

Then took a slow sip of coffee.

Then stared at Barry, who was sweeping in calm, deliberate strokes‚Äîas if he hadn‚Äôt just declared war on customer service as a concept.

""Barry.""

Barry didn‚Äôt look up. ""Yes?""

Tina pointed at the sign. ""What the hell is that?""

Barry‚Äôs smile was serene. ""A helpful reminder.""

Tina exhaled slowly. ""For who?""

Barry‚Äôs smile widened slightly. ""Everyone.""

Tina rubbed her temples. ""No.""

Barry‚Äôs voice was calm. ""Yes.""

Tina glared at him. Then at the sign. Then at the security cameras, which she knew would somehow not show him putting it up.

Then back at Barry.

She sighed.

""Fine. Whatever. Not my problem.""

And she sat down, silently deciding that she would not engage with this further.


-

6:43 AM

A man approached the counter.

""Hey, uh‚Ä¶ quick question‚Äî""

He stopped mid-sentence.

His mouth opened. Then closed.

He frowned, looking slightly confused, as if he had forgotten what he was saying.

Tina blinked. ""‚Ä¶You okay?""

The man hesitated. Looked up at the sign. Then nodded.

""Never mind.""

And he walked away.

Tina‚Äôs stomach dropped.

She slowly turned her head toward Barry.

Barry was already watching her. Smiling.

Tina pointed at him. ""NO.""

Barry gestured at the sign. ""Correct.""

Tina swore under her breath.


-

7:15 AM

A woman walked in, looked at the sign, hesitated, then left without buying anything.

A man grabbed a gas station sandwich, opened his mouth like he was about to ask something‚Ä¶ then silently checked himself out and left.

A kid tugged on his dad‚Äôs sleeve. ""Hey, how come‚Äî"" The kid froze. His eyes flicked to the sign. He closed his mouth and looked vaguely unsettled.


Tina watched all of this unfold.

Tina did not like this.

At all.

She grabbed Barry by the sleeve. ""You fix whatever the hell this is. Right now.""

Barry tilted his head. ""Fix what?""

Tina gestured wildly at the store, the customers, the general air of existential dread creeping into the air.

""ALL OF IT.""

Barry‚Äôs voice was even. ""No one has complained.""

Tina let out a frustrated groan. ""BECAUSE NO ONE CAN ASK ANYTHING.""

Barry smiled. ""Exactly.""

Tina wanted to scream.


-

7:45 AM ‚Äì Chad Arrives

Chad made it exactly three steps into the store before his entire body tensed.

Slowly, his eyes lifted to the sign.

His breathing became shallow.

Then, like a man resisting an invisible force, he took a slow step toward the counter.

He opened his mouth.

Nothing came out.

His jaw clenched. His fingers curled into fists.

His eyes flicked toward the bold, block letters above him.

 ""NO QUESTIONS.""



Chad‚Äôs breathing quickened. He was fighting it.

Tina grabbed him by the shoulders. ""Chad, don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not worth it.""

Chad shook his head. ""NO. I HAVE TO KNOW.""

He tried to ask again.

Failed.

Visibly struggled against something neither of them could see.

Then, finally, with a long, shaky exhale‚Ä¶ he slumped in defeat.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Okay.‚Äù

And then he turned and left.

Tina was horrified.

Barry was deeply pleased.


-

8:12 AM ‚Äì Frank Arrives

Frank stepped inside, took one long look at the sign, sighed like a man who was too old for this, and immediately turned toward the door.

Tina called after him. ""Where the hell are you going?""

Frank didn‚Äôt stop. ""Away from whatever‚Äôs happening in here.""

Tina threw up her hands. ""Coward.""

Frank just kept walking.

Barry smiled after him. ""Smart man.""


-

9:00 AM ‚Äì Enough.

Tina had reached her limit.

With zero hesitation, she ripped the sign off the wall.

Barry watched with interest.

Tina stared him down. ""It‚Äôs over.""

Barry‚Äôs smile didn‚Äôt falter. ""Is it?""

Tina frowned.

Slowly, she turned the sign around.

There was another sign taped underneath it.

It read:

""GOOD CHOICE.""

Tina froze.

Her hands trembled slightly.

She looked at Barry.

Barry tilted his head. ""Do you feel better now?""

Tina, gripping the sign, whispered: ""I hate you.""

Barry nodded. ""That‚Äôs fair.""

Tina took a long, slow sip of coffee.

Then, to no one in particular, she muttered, ‚ÄúI need to find a new job.‚Äù

But she wouldn‚Äôt.

She never did.

1ipurla,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ipurla/i_21f_am_dealing_with_bitterness_and_resentment/,I (21F) am dealing with bitterness and resentment in my 5+ year relationship with my fianc√© (22M),"Trying to get advice on a 5+ year relationship. I (21F) am engaged to (22M). I have been with this guy (22M) for over five years and I feel like I (21F) hold a lot of resentment towards him. I‚Äôve been a financial provider always for our relationship, the bread winner. I don‚Äôt necessarily like that, considering I‚Äôm a female that‚Äôs had to work in a blue collar workplace that is dominated by males. Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Ä¶I like my job‚Äîto an extent‚Äîand have worked there for 3+ years and now I have the privilege of training others how to do what I busted my a≈°s doing those years. Although it‚Äôs not what I would want to do, I don‚Äôt believe in gender roles but I want a man who will metaphorically ‚Äúwork till his hands bleed‚Äù as long as it‚Äôs for us I‚Äôm grateful. My partner right now (22M) is not making as much as I do and I know times are tough but I can see and observe his lack of effort and maturity. He doesn‚Äôt take risks for me it seems. He says he is doing his best but my thought process is why wouldn‚Äôt he do the same for me as I would for him. I have a higher position in my job to where I could get him a job making good money compared to where he works now, but he won‚Äôt take the opportunity. In my own opinion, that hurts me. I‚Äôve worked since I was 16 and always dreamed of a man that would provide and take care of me and love me. I don‚Äôt feel that he does what he can to the fullest extent. It feels like he doesn‚Äôt care. 

Skipping to today ‚¨áÔ∏è

I am not a materialistic woman but do sometimes want gifts on holidays or special occasions like Christmas, Birthdays, Valentine‚Äôs Day, or Anniversary‚Äôs. Those things mean a lot to me. I‚Äôve expressed this before. SIDE NOTE: Before he even met me his Step-dad passed away on Valentine‚Äôs Day so he doesn‚Äôt really do Valentine‚Äôs Day and I told him the importance to me for that holiday and he seemed that he could do that. Earlier in our relationship he would always forget about these days‚Ä¶as almost everything else I would have to remind him about and I have done that my whole relationship.    Sometimes it feels like I am his mother and not his fianc√©. So he didn‚Äôt forget this year but before the date of Valentine‚Äôs I mentioned to him I don‚Äôt need much just some candy, a card, or and stuffed animal from dollar tree‚Ä¶anything that would make him think of me‚ÄîI would be happy about. So‚Ä¶I made him a gift with photos of us, a card, his favorite coffee, and candy. In all honesty, I was expecting and hoping he would do the same for me. I always go all out and expensive for him because I love him and want him to have the best. This time I didn‚Äôt to save money. Though, he doesn‚Äôt seem to do the same for me and didn‚Äôt this valentines. 
So our finances are separate but the bills I pay a large majority of, and often cover his without expectancy of any payment back or return. He has either spent all his money, been unemployed, or occasionally helps with bills‚Äî those are the reasons why he would be broke. So he said he could do valentines later a few days ago before valentines because he was gonna be broke. He asked to put celebrating the holiday off until 2 weeks later. 

Question 1: Is it fair for me to be unhappy with that?

So I wasn‚Äôt happy with that but offered him money to get me something and sent him a good amount and multiple times expressed to him that I would appreciate even the littlest cheapest things. 

Question 2: Am I entitled to feel dumb for sending him money for MY valentines gift? 

So with the things in mind I got him I paid for us to have some good takeout also, he picks it up from work because he‚Äôs out and I‚Äôm not. He comes home, I give him his stuff‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt seem to even enjoy it. I even handmade a box for him with the stuff inside. It‚Äôs like he saw it, shrugged, said ‚Äúthank you I love you‚Äù and said nothing else. So at this point I‚Äôm wondering if he got me anything because all day I‚Äôve heard nothing and seen so much about others receiving gifts today. I‚Äôm getting some of the takeout he picked up, and I see he hid a card in the boxes‚Ä¶I open it I loved it it was sweet but he also mentioned something that annoyed him in the card that I do. On Valentine‚Äôs Day. I was grateful but kind of struck by this. I just said ‚Äúthank you and I love you‚Äù and continued on with getting my dinner. So this might seem stupid, but he didn‚Äôt get any drinks for our dinner so we didn‚Äôt have anything. I asked him to get some but he refused to stop on the way home other than the place we ordered from. I offered to buy soda placing the order and he said no. So I didn‚Äôt have anything and as I was eating I asked if he could run to the store for a drink that‚Äôs 2mins from where we live‚Äîhe said no. Then I felt inclined to ask him again to please do it as ‚Äúvalentines gift.‚Äù I feel like he never thinks of me. So I mention that to him and he says that it isn‚Äôt true. I said will if you could please do that I‚Äôll even pay for it, I just want to eat. I offered to go with, he didn‚Äôt want to. 

Question 3: Should it be a problem for asking him to do something for me as my partner? (I feel like I do a lot for him financially, mentally, and physically‚Ä¶so my thought process is ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt he just do this for me?‚Äù)

I end up telling him how I really feel but am willing to drop it and tell him just don‚Äôt worry about going. That starts a big argument that results to him screaming and telling me I‚Äôm ungrateful, lazy, can never be wrong, and that I am not supportive. We argue and I told him if I told him how I felt that I knew exactly what he was gonna say after I expressed my feelings. It was excuse after excuse. I don‚Äôt feel he validates my feelings. He thinks he is and says he offers solutions but I tell him why his excuses, actions, or solutions aren‚Äôt feasible and then he throws in the towel. He screams, cries, breaks things, and says I can never be wrong. Am I the problem? Then it leads me to think that I am resentful of our past because I do bring up things that haven‚Äôt change or hurt me and never resolved in the first place. I have recently started living for myself, and not for him solely, but along with that I have felt so burnt out. I have cleaned, cooked, provided, and done so much for this man. 

Question 4: Is it feasible for wanting a lover who is also a provider even though I‚Äôve tried to make this work for so long? 

When we were in high-school I even did his virtual classes so that he would graduate along with my own. (I know it‚Äôs pitiful) I am tired. I‚Äôve been so depressed, can‚Äôt clean or cook for me or him.  So I truly feel like I‚Äôm burnt out. I feel that he should do more for me as I did for him when he needed picking up. I‚Äôm down and out and just want someone to motivate me and help me the way that I helped him. I feel as if I resent him for all the times I‚Äôve helped and worked for him just for him to leave me high and dry and drowning. On top of all that I feel hurt because we‚Äôve argued before and he‚Äôs pushed me before when he was drunk and trying to drive a motorcycle. He said that him drinking around me was hard because I just set him off. Yes this is a lot of information and if you‚Äôve made it this far thank you and I need a therapist but don‚Äôt have money. So my final questions are‚Ä¶

Question 5: How do I know if I will ever be able to get rid of this resentment? 

Question 6: Does anyone have any advice on how to make this work? (I love him but I‚Äôm trying to learn to love myself too)",1,1739598052.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

That's how Abraham Lincoln's mother died. People used to get really sick from drinking raw milk quite often back in the day, and a lot of people died too. They called it ""milk sickness."" 

Pasteurization ended milk sickness. People don't have to die from drinking milk anymore.

Why drink raw milk? Does it taste better? Is it better in coffee or tea? Does food made with it taste better? Is there some health benefit worth risking severe illness or death for? Aren't you all worried about bird flu?

1ipuqdm,https://gofund.me/ff6b7fcd,Life is crazy and I could use some help.,"On November 7th, 2024, I headed home for lunch as I always did. I would use my hour lunch to take a break and clear my head by playing a little bit of Baldurs Gate 3 and hanging out with my kitty of 14 years. When I was normally greeted by happy meows and chirps from my cat Lily, instead I was greeted by fire trucks, police tape, and my entire life in ash. Turns out, the night before, shortly after saying goodbye to my kitty and giving her treats and pets,  I left for my girlfriend's house (also named Lily, I call them my bouqet) the ex of the tennant above me decided to get revenge on him by pushing in my window ac unit, dumping gas all over my couch and my thousands of magic the gathering cards on the coffee table, and igniting the life I had just began building with the love of my life and the kitten that helped me get through so much since my early teens. 

I wasn't able to get closer than 5 feet from the front door as it was an active crime scene with the ohio fire marshal conducting his investigation. The first thing I asked was what about my cat? Please tell me she survived. She had not, luckily not touch by the flame, but taken by the smoke. I was her person, the only one she ever really bonded with, and I will never be able to forgive the guilt of not being there for her final moments. Lily was a 1 year old cranky old lady. One of those cats that you know will live to 20 out of sheer spite for the world. She came alive when she became a one animal house cat, I was even able to hold her without losing copious amounts of blood. She was my light, she was my little girl, and she was adopted so fast by my girlfriend Lily. Every time I snuggled with them, or human Lily annoyed cat Lily with love, I could not believe how much it made my heart soar. Now, my little girl is a box of ash and bag of hair on my shelf, her paw print receiving a place of reverence on the christmas tree this year. These things provide none of the warmth and love of my old kitten, but I swear I still feel her hop up on the bed as I'm waking up, ready for treats and love and to yell at me as I leave for work. 

While things are ultimately replaceable, everything I had was lost in the fire. Cherished bits and bobs that wove a tapestry of some of my best times and memories. Two of my grandpa's hats next to the signed album of my favorite band who I met while wearing his ""super grandpa"" hat which had the band laughing and striking up conversation with me.

1ipup19,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_julylifecoach/comments/1ipup19/buying_someone_their_future/,Buying someone their future,"My Buddhist order, while being Buddhist, is not a religious organization. Which sounds ridiculous, but hear me out: we‚Äôre a group of people focused on practicing, donation, and volunteering. We run many small scale and large scale events and programs but it is 100% volunteering and donation based, because we have a strict policy against hiring people.

This means there are people who work long shifts for free. There are people who are in positions of management and such for free. There are people who run programs for three months for free. Why is this possible? It‚Äôs possible because everyone in our order benefitted from seeing the end of suffering through Buddhism and they are paying it forward to the world.

But everything costs money in this world, so how do we get the funding to do all these things in the world? We‚Äôre a membership based order (it‚Äôs actually more like an organization, I just call it an order for convenience) so we have to pay a membership fee with whatever amount you want to pay. That‚Äôs the membership fee but there‚Äôs also people who donate after the dharma talks and Buddhist school programs.

I used to be very against donations, and my wife still is pretty against donations. Why? Because I‚Äôm not in control of how my money is spent. I started donating a lot because of animals. My dog had a big genetic defect that required a pretty big surgery and thanks to UC Davis‚Äô veterinary school he was able to get a second chance at life. The surgery was some cutting edge technology stuff that wasn‚Äôt possible in the neighborhood vets, so I knew that‚Äôs where the money was going; this gave me a lot of confidence in the donations.

The other donation story is my story with the [Rabbit Rescue](https://ckarchive.com/b/r8u8hoh2ko799t48nng83sx2pw666c7), and I started volunteering with the animal shelter too so I guess animals are really an avatar of the Buddha for me, always encouraging me to go to the next step of loving the world. In any case, it helps to see where the money is going when I‚Äôm committing to a nonprofit because with nonprofits it‚Äôs not a direct transaction where I get the value immediately out of the spending.

Now with my coaching practice I‚Äôve gotten to know a lot of founders for nonprofits and again this makes it easy for me to donate because I know where my money is going to. When I visited Sujata Academy it was especially meaningful for all of the pilgrims because it was living proof that their donations, regardless of the amount, was making a difference in the opposite side of the world.

This is a long ass intro to the primary point of today‚Äôs writing: I want to introduce you to a cause I‚Äôm personally invested in and tell you where your money is going in advance.

On March 1st, Spill the Tea Cafe and Fightstory are collaborating on a [self-defense class for teenagers](https://www.zeffy.com/ticketing/empower-and-protect-teen-self-defense-workshop-with-angela-lee-pucci) at United BJJ Hawaii. If you live in Oahu, I would love for your teenager to check out this class. I‚Äôll tell you a little bit of a backstory of how this class got together.

I work with [Haylin Dennison](https://www.instagram.com/haylindennisonlcsw/), the founder of [Spill the Tea Cafe](https://www.spilltheteacafe.org/) as a personal life coach and business coach. Through getting to know her over the past year I‚Äôve gotten to truly understand the effects of Hawaii‚Äôs colonization over the state‚Äôs history both on the social level and personal level. Spill the Tea Cafe isn‚Äôt really a cafe that sells coffees, to me it feels more like a European *salon* where minds gather and ideas get fostered. But after visiting the cafe in my last visit to Honolulu what I learned that it is a home for so many LGBTQ teenagers.

Running this kind of a ‚Äúgroup home‚Äù for teenagers is hard work, but Haylin is a natural mama. The whole cafe got started when her own son came out as trans and through parenting a trans child she got to understand firsthand the shortcomings of the current mental health support system in the island. To Haylin all the kids who come to the cafe are like her own, and I told her multiple times ‚Äúif you want to make this sustainable, you may need to scale down‚Äù and it is always met with her passionate ‚ÄúI am not going to leave any of the kids behind‚Äù (thank god coaching can help you with sustaining without scaling down!).

Many teenagers spend their entire afternoon there to only go home to sleep because they are not accepted in their homes. Or there are domestic disputes at home. Or they do not get fed. Or they do not have a space for themselves where they can get schoolwork done. For many different reasons this cafe is not a secondary home but the primary home for the kids.

And the word ‚Äúkids‚Äù makes it sound like a vague idea of group of people you don‚Äôt know, and of course it feels like that because you haven‚Äôt met them in person. But B, T, R, all the teens I met and talked to last time were individual human beings with their lives and withering dreams because they are finding it hard to believe that there is a good future for them.

What can I do for these kids? What did I want when I was a kid? I reflected back on my experience being a teenager and something that came up was, I wish I knew how to handle bullies. I talk about my experience of being bullied in my book [The Shame Formula](https://ck.julylifecoach.com/social-anxiety) and because I know jiujitsu now I can‚Äôt help but think ‚Äúwhat if I knew jiujitsu then?‚Äù. It‚Äôs less about I‚Äôd be able to beat the shit out of my bullies, it‚Äôs more about I‚Äôd have the inner resolve to know that what they do to me doesn‚Äôt affect me; it‚Äôs up to me to protect them from the damage that I can do.

So at first I was thinking of teaching the class on my own. I know enough to teach some level of self defense, so I‚Äôll get the kids to a beach or something or rent a gym for a few hours, you know? While I was thinking along those lines [Kiki](https://www.instagram.com/callmekikki/) from the cafe had reached out to a MMA legend in Hawaii, Angela Lee Pucci, to potentially collaborate on this event. This seems random, so I‚Äôll explain how this came about.

[Angela Lee Pucci](https://www.instagram.com/angelaleemma/) is a 6x MMA world champion who competed in ONE Championship in Asia. But it wasn‚Äôt just her who was kicking ass in the octagon: her sister Victoria Lee was also a MMA prodigy with 3 victories under her belt before even graduating from high school. Then on one day she was no longer with us, and Angela revealed to the world that Victoria had taken her own life.

Angela further revealed that she also attempted to end her life. But through these experiences she decided to change the karma of shame in mental health to found a nonprofit for combat sport athletes‚Äô mental health, [Fightstory](https://fightstory.org/). Fightstory aims to educate and advocate for the mental health of participants in the combat sports.

This makes it sound like it‚Äôs just for MMA athletes and professional competitors. But it‚Äôs actually deeper than that: when we got to meeting in person something we discussed was the future goal of getting our feet in the education system. Why? Because wrestling, one of the biggest sports in American high schools, is a big reason why high school athletes struggle with mental health.

When athletes compete, they want to be as big as the weight class would allow. So suppose you‚Äôre competing at -72kg‚Äôs, this means your maximum weight in the division is 72kg. What you do is you bulk up and train to 75\~80kg, and right before you weigh in you dehydrate and cut to ‚Äúmake weight‚Äù and gain it back again before the match.

This is generally how everyone competes because weight is a great advantage in combat sports, and because it‚Äôs the established norm people don‚Äôt think about changing this system; instead they look for different ways to make this more effective and efficient. But because humans are not just bioengines with metabolism, this kind of a harsh treatment of the body always comes with side effects ‚Äî often negative ones.

There‚Äôs a skit about a high school wrestler cutting weight and look at the comment section.

Add to this the immense stress the parents and coaches put on the teenagers. Is this the right way to approach combat sports, which can be a wonderful confidence booster and healthy way to live life?

After a long conversation Angela has generously donated her academy and her time to teaching this class. Hey, isn‚Äôt that such a nice upgrade from a Billy self defense seminar? And this is where I‚Äôm asking for your help. Even though Angela has generously donated her time and resources, this kind of an event still requires money to run and I would love for this to be the starting point for YOUR involvement in these nonprofits‚Äô journey.

My ask is simple: please donate to Spill the Tea Cafe and Fightstory. It can be $5 donations each, it can be 1$ and 9$ each; the amount doesn‚Äôt matter, what matters is that this is the starting point for your investment into Hawaii‚Äôs future. If you‚Äôre not convinced about Hawaii‚Äôs future, I‚Äôll write a separate writing about that.

I‚Äôll be there in person to let you know what happens on March 1st. But wait, there‚Äôs more!

Whatever amount you donate, please let me know and I‚Äôll match your donation to donate to LA fire recovery efforts. Your money goes to 3 places: the nonprofits, the people they help, and LA.

I bought it on eBay as a used item and it arrived broken. I went through all the support articles and vids on baratza's site but they didn't show a problem like I was seeing. Eventually I took it apart and saw the motor broken off the chassis. I told the seller and they gave me an instant refund and told me to not bother returning it. I super glued the chunk of chassis that had ripped off with the motor. I can see where it broke is a stress point but the glue is holding. The pulse button doesn't work but the main on/off switch is OK. It not pretty but it's mine till it breaks again.

It was exciting to grind coffee after so much failure.

I ground up some Westly Farms Columbian Supermo in a corse grind (37 on the Encore). I mixed up 1 3/4ths cups of ground beans with 6 cups of water. I had been doing the same thing with a similar coffee that was preground for standard coffee makers. 

Now I get to see if corse grind makes a difference. I bet it will be easier to filter.

Should I let it brew longer than standard grind? Thanks all. I may do the first batch the same as I've been doing to get an apples to apples comparison.",1,1739597550.0,coldbrew,0,1.0,False

I have always put my career and business first so I don't socialize a lot outside of longtime friends.

So I do instacart some nights and weekends to stay active.  I sometimes go in this store near my house to shop orders.  There is a woman there who always caught my eye but its her workplace so I don't say anything.  I have been going in this store for almost 3 years and don't usually get as much as a hi from her.  

This past sunday was busy because of the superbowl so I was in there a couple times,     the first time she saw me looking for something.  She stopped helping the customer she was helping to tell me I look confused and pointed me in the right direction.  I didnt think anything of it.  The last time I went in she stopped what she was doing as soon as she saw me to start small talk with me.  She was playing with her ear and hair, head tilted and laughing randomly.  I paid and left after talking for a min or two.  

Fast forward to last night.  Got an order to go buy a cologne from this store.  Someone had to unlock it so she comes around the corner, sees me starts smiling and says you thats like 20 times today you have come in to bother me and starts laughing.  I told her the cologne I needed.  She asked if it was for me and I said no, its an instacart order.  She then tells me I should get that one for myself because she thinks I would like it because she likes it.  She isnt commision or anything like that so financial motives arent at play.  That caught me off guard.

I may be overthinking it, but I think she might like me.  No conversation for almost 3yrs and now its like she acts like she has known me forever.  I dont know exactly when she works.  

I know it is where she works so I dont want to give her my number or ask her out in front of customers and possibly make it weird for here. There is a cashier that works morning that knows me pretty well.  Would it be weird to have her pass along a note for me to this other girl?  If not, what other approach should I take?  Not looking for an official date at first, but maybe a coffee or something to get to know her better.

Sarah Reflects On The Logistics For The Upcoming Fetish Con Dinner. Border Bunny's And Zero's Punishment Is To Be Dao's Pets For A Day, At Katie's Resort.","Sarah's perspective

I find Nora waiting for me right outside the door, in the Domme chat room texting our peers. Well, her peers, though they accept me as an honorary member. I hear Mary's voice in my head ""So why not make it official?"" I have to admit it's tempting.

I stayed on the Perseverance for Nora and Sheila, despite her and Dave's generous offer to write my character out or find another ASSHO. They even offered to give me a choice how my character was written out. 

I enjoyed submitting to Nora, but hated being Mary's Alpha Slave when she got demoted. I just couldn't stand how bad my sweet girl crush treated Mary, despite her humiliating me and raping me. Two wrongs didn't make a right. 

It was worse for me that Sheila was bothered by it, too. But she didn't want to make waves and jeopardize her position as Chief Screenwriter. And Layla seemed to just blindly accept Mary's outcast status and treat her like shit, even laughing it off when Nora abused her. Especially since my blond former Navy subordinate had never done anything to her personally. I love both of them like sisters, but can't unsee their failings shown up by that time period. Though Karma has almost literally come back to bite them on their frequently nude asses.

When I dommed Sheila for a day while we were trying to save Sandy, I felt sad traumatizing her, but got a thrill domming my hot best friend and boss. Then when she started temp subbing, I did enjoy being her Alpha Slave. When this particular madness started, I thought I was just outranking her for the day again. It was nice when it got extended, until we started rationalizing forcing her.

 Fortunately,Sandy's spunk and Dave's  conscience fixed that. And Sheila's amazing courage coming back as a consenting slave. Though it was...odd that that revealed Sandy and Dave were....getting it on. How long had that been going on? I wanted to ask...but it just seemed rude to stick my nose in.

Now I enjoyed being Alpha to two pretty girls my age, three if you count Vivian, plus a sexy Thicc MILF like Cindy Phu. I'd demoted my two former bosses to permanent Beta status not to punish or humiliate them. But to protect them. It was coming on endgame. We were going to try to schmooze up to Ari at the Fetish Con, whether Nora won or not. Nora winning just strengthened our negotiating position.
We were attending this year before Dave put her name in for the award. But it made sense, and gave us a solid reason to be there. When we brought who Ari saw as two of our biggest threats, we needed her to see them as muzzled slaves of a new leadership ready to deal with her.

Most of us were going in fine outfits, ironically most were designed by Sheila, who along with Layla would be kneeling nude on the floor next to our table in hoods, panel gags, and arms bindered behind their backs. When it got time to eat, they'd have trays strapped around their waists, anchored to their nipples, with order pads on them to bring our orders to the serving staffers.

Dave would be escorted in by Sandy on his right and Nora on his left. Constance and Lara would follow, leading their bound and gagged sweeties on a leash. I'd actually lead the way as Alpha Slave, give our tickets over, and lead to our table. I'd pull out the chairs for Dave, Sandy, Nora, Lara and Constance, in that order. I'd order the slaves to kneel, Sheila between Dave and Sandy, Layla between Dave and Nora. 

Dave, Lara and Constance were negotiating for us to share a large table with Ari's delegation. That shouldn't affect our entrance protocol, as Ari would have a Junior Domme/Alpha Slave to handle their entrance and seating. It would make negotiations for combined projects easier, and convince Ari we had Sheila and Layla firmly under control as our slaves. We hoped.

""Babe? What did you think of QOM's offer?"" We'd fallen in side by side walking to the Ready Room. I'd been so busy walking down memory lane, then working on the future logistics for the Fetish Con I didn't acknowledge my Mistress and Sweetie rightvaway. ""Hmmmm? Oh, I'm sorry Mistress Nora, just woolgathering. I'm intrigued by the offer, but going to want Lara or Constance to get me the Qualification standards they don't keep secret. I want to know what I'm getting into.""

""Sweetie, I can get that for you, I'm part of your Administrative chain of command now, and I've proven I can handle paperwork as well as hot nude slavegirls."" I realize I'd unintentionally slighted her. Sheila and Layla generally used me for admin work, because Nora couldn't be trusted with attention to detail or getting things done in a timely manner. With as much responsibility as they gave her, they should have trained her better on the admin side of the production. But it had been easier to use me then train her. As a former Navy Division Officer, I was an skilled paper pusher. 

When Lara and Constance took over that stopped. They made sure Nora learned how to fill out paperwork and route it in a timely manner. They made her spend all day on one requisition form for new bondage gear for Slave Border Bunny. When she whined and complained, they marched her into Constance's apartment and made her look at the nasty marks some of our too small bindings were leaving on the stoic Mexican girl. 

Then they made her give a tearful apology to the suffering former Marine for not being an attentive enough domme. Suprisingly, Layla wanted to hug Nora and tell her it was okay, but Lara and Constance forbade her. They said Nora needed consequences, not coddling, when she let down the people she was in charge of. Their methods were harsh, but just a few more instances like that really shaped Nora up. Now she can route a request form after cropping one of the girl's cute butts without even looking strained.

""I didn't mean to offend, Mistress. it's just-"" We had stopped facing each other in the passageway. Nora put a finger to her lips, shushing me. ""It's just you're used to having to do the paperwork Layla and Sheila didn't have time for. or redoing it when I screwed it up.""  She clapped my right shoulder with her left. ""You were often the glue that held us together. You still are. If you'd left after your contract was up the first year, I'm not sure what we would have done. You should be nominated for that award if it wasn't for the silly difference of your title. I can step up now, with a lot of the credit to our little restrained sweethearts, but a lot of that is you, too, Sarah. A small smile ""Lara and Constance kicking my blond butt into shape played a part.""

We stood there a moment smiling at each other fondly. Maybe more than fondness, if we were on personal time we'd probably sneak off to our rooms for a little ""girl time"".

Then Nora broke the moment. ""Speaking of the girls, that whole bottom slaves for the rest of their contracts speech was brilliant. They looked nervous for a moment, and they know this will be resolved long before that. You had me convinced for a moment. IF Mary's a mole, I'm sure she bought it."" I wait, knowing her well enough to know she's going somewhere with this.

""I do think you were serious about submitting a request they bunk with the Queen Of Mean. If you're really determined to punish them that way, you know I and the rest of our Chain Of Command will back you up. But I'd like to ask you to reconsider. It's been hectic shooting and preparing for a black op against Ari. We give them as much down time as possible, keep them in the loop as much as we can, and let them know we still respect them as our friends, even when we have to be hard on them to convince others we only see them as our helots.""

""But it's still been hard, even though they both sometimes enjoy subbing. Trapped in bitchsuits and those stupid slavesuits for hours, helpless and dependent on us when they're strong, independent women. We razz them sometimes, I think we can all admit it's fun, but they know we mean them no harm. Sadistic bitches like Dao and Mary want to see the poor little things suffer. Sometimes we have to let them have their way just enough to make our ""revolt and new regime"" look convincing. They usually bear it so stoically and never so much as consider tapping out.""

""I honestly expected more fussing and rebellion from them, even though they both volunteered. We've had a rough week, but this is the most trouble we've had with them without looking hard for something to gig them on, they're very good slaves. Do you really have to make them spend the night with a bunch of cruel butch dykes?""

I sigh. I was pissed when they started being sassy little bitches to Nora about her prank lesson. Especially, when Nora showed the maturity to give them an out before she punished them. Like my sweetie said, they're both too smart for dumb crap like defying a domme while restrained, with an electro butt plug poked up their adorable rear ends. While they were in the roles, poor decisions demanded consequences, just like they taught us in Officer Candidate School.

""I spoke in the heat of the moment, I'm really not keen on leaving them alone with QOM's crew for a night. I'd like to give them an off the books punishment, no write ups. But one that sends a clear message. We can do it on a day we can give them the next day off, relax in their girlfriends' quarters, and have us bring them what they request if we can. We need to imprint on them consequences, while letting them know we still love them. Any ideas, Mistress Nora?""

That sadistic glee from the first time she slapped tape over my mouth and started bossing me around glows in her eyes. ""Sarah, I thought you'd never ask. Remember how we're going to have the Princess turn her captive, Gunny Perez, into a ponygirl for one episode? And I know where Sheila's bitchsuit is in storage.""
I lean forward eagerly, I think I know where she is going with this..

""Mistress Dao would love to have a pony and a puppy girl to train and exercise while we do a discounted day package at Katie's resort. Then we can all meet up for a picnic. We'll tether the slaves to a tree so they can watch us eat a sumptous spread. 
They'll have plenty of oatmeal mush to eat and tepid water to drink.""

""I like...."" I'm sure my smile was a twin of my Mistress's malicious one. Hey, I said we liked razzing them sometimes, we'll keep them safe, fed and hydrated.

Nora's face sobered ""We do a clandestine recon, try to spot any evidence Katie's in bed with Ari and is just playing us. We tell the girl's that being Dao's pets is their punishment for sassing me, officialy. Unofficially, they're on a recon mission, too. Being Dao's pets will suck, but they need to keep an eye out for any giveaway of a connection between Dao and Katie, or Ari's other mole. They can debrief us the next day as equals while we serve them breakfast in bed. Until then they're Mistress Dao's obedient little pets and our loyal, watchful spies."" 

I nod soberly. Then our phones buzz on the domme chat.

Mistress Jasmine: You two having your own private dyke session? Get your tongues out of each others muffs and get over here, or we'll start without you.

Mistress Sandy: We tied Dao face up on the Ready Room table, we're going to take turns sitting on her face when you guys get here, so please hurry.

I look at my love, smiling. ""Well we don't want to miss that Mistress Nora."" She winks back at me. ""Definitely not, Alpha Slave Kim."" We turn and head to the Ready Room.

Nora's perspective, morning, two days later.

I'm in charge of the team going to Katie's resort! It was actually supposed to be Sandy. But she insisted in a dommes' meeting that I should do it. Her rationale being since I'm officialy 4th in the chain of command, I need leadership experience on expeditions outside our walls, so I should be Top Domme for this one. Sandy graciously accepted being my Executive Domme. I do realize Sandy is going along to take the reins if I lose my grip. Still this is my opportunity to prove she or Sarah doesn't need to ""babysit me"" when I'm in charge.

Besides Sarah and I, Mistress Mary and Mistress Dao are going. Katie is providing a chariot for Dao to hitch her Pony girl Border Bunny to. It's big enough for Mary and has a small Kennel so Zero can ride snugly but safely.

But Dao wants to make Border Bunny run, maybe race other ponygirls if any are there. So Mistress Mary gets quality time with her training slave,  Zero in the bitchsuit. Dao will of course grade Mary's control of Zero when she's not off racing Border Bunny.

We did give the girls the option of not being Dao's pets for a day. Especially if time in the bitchsuit was too traumatic for Sheila. Sarah admitted she wouldn't recommend they bunk with QOM's crew. But she would submit the discipline form, recommending another ""Domme's Discretion punishment. Both of them would rather get a day of petplay punishment, then wait for another nasty suprise.

They were suprisingly amenable to gathering what intelligence they could, even while suffering under Dao and Mary's crops, whips and paddles. A day of rest afterward in their lovers' Quarters with us waiting on them really appealed to them. I got up from my chair and went to where they were sitting side by side in their blue coveralls. I put a hand on each of their shoulders as they looked back and up at me.

""My poor, longsuffering, brave girls. Despite the bad week with discipline, you're really good slaves, and teamates. You deserve a day of rest and pampering."" I looked at my comrades, everyone was there, even Dave. This was an in house meeting, so Dao, Mary and Jasmine were not invited. ""Tomorrow everyone of us needs to be on our A-game, not just these two. They have the hardest jobs while we get to relax and be spoiled. If they can focus on the mission while being humiliated by those two bitches, we do a disservice to them by forgetting we're there to gather intel, not soak in luxury.""

""Those of us whom remain here"" He nodded to Lara on his right and Constance on his left ""will be on hot standby if you need us for anything. We have faith in you and your team, acting Top Domme Nora. All of them."" He nodded very specifically at Sheila and Layla, who nodded back. They already knew, but I like how Dave always affirmed that however subjugated they were, we still saw them as teamates and friends.

We ended in a big group hug, which Dave tried to duck out of. Sandy pulled him over by the sleeve of his suitcoat to participate.
Our warm awkward moments made me long for us all to be equals again, domming my sexy friends was a passing thrill, but this love was more enduring.

The plan for this morning was Lara and Sandy would bitchsuit Sheila and leave her outside the apartment door. Constance and Sarah would do the same at Constance's Quarters for Pony Girl Layla.

Then they'd go back inside and wait for Mary to come for Zero, and Dao to come for Border Bunny, with the requisite offerings of specialty coffee for their host dommes.  The humiliation ritual of the guest dommes going inside to chit chat with our dommes was about a half hour. The tethered slaves would be alone with their thoughts, watched on camera by their dommes. And myself, using my executive privileges as Fourth in command to monitor the cameras on my laptop. And yell at them if needed.

Then Dao will unhitch Layla's tether, and Mary Sheila's. Lara and Sandy, and Constance and Sarah will escort their charges down to the reception area.
There are already specialized eyelets in the floor to attach them to. Zero will be secured with nipple clamps and clit leash in the middle of the room. Border Bunny will stand to her right, tethered to the floor eyelet with a clit leash. Then their superiors will sit in the comfortable seats provided to wait for me. I'm told when I come in, the dommes will stand out of respect for my title and position even though I'm a Junior Domme.

This is where we have a suprise for all four of our current slaves, excepting Sarah. Vivian and Cindy will be in my office as I monitor Zero and Border Bunny, and acompany me as I head down to take official charge of the expedition. 

Mary and Dao will formally greet me, thank Lara, Constance and myself for the use of our slaves, with acknowledgement of Mistress Sandy and Alpha Slave Sarah. 
After I greet them I'll drop a suprise. Viv and Cindy won't be going. Instead Lara will be taking them out on a spa and shopping trip. The kicker? The funds  come out of Zero and Border Bunny's bank accounts.

I imagine they'll be relieved. They've gotten used to how privilged our slavery is compared to their Mistress's. If they're going back into Katie's domain, they could be ordered to assume slave duties by her or one of her dommes if they're needed. I'll assure them Zero and Border Bunny will be happy to fill in if they can, as happy as they are to pay for their Alpha's day off.

Of course, this is done partly because we're not sure how loyal they are to Katie.
We've been trying to get it out of them in casual conversation, but they're very close lipped about it, even with Sheila and Layla.
I imagine Lara will try to discretely get more out of them during their girl's outing. Anyway, we're better off without two possible spies reporting to Katie.Or Ari.

So it's showtime, 7:00 am. I watch a split screen on my laptop. Sandy leads Zero out of the apartment in her bitchsuit on a tether. She ties Sheila's leash off to an eyelet on the wall. She bends down to pet her tethered sister reassuringly. ""Hang in their big sis, you're doing great!"" As she straightens up and walks back to Lara's apartment, Zero raises her head. It's probably reflexive, but I have to nip it in the bud. ""Bow your head slave, I haven't changed my decree!"" I exclaim into my laptop mike.

Hearing my voice booming from the intercom over her head like an unseen but all seeing goddess, she bows her black hooded head. Poor little thing, I know she hates staring at the fucking floor for hours when she's trapped in that thing. But I have to be seen as stern and consistent with my decrees for her.

I look up at my guests in blue coveralls. Vivian is watching my smart tv with headphones so not to bother me. She's watching our Orange Flaired president speaking with a look of understandable consternation. I really can't blame the fit blond former domme for that. Cindy is reading a book on the comfortable chair in front of me. My copy of Methalusah's Children. The Vietnamese MILF has a suprising taste for old sci fi which built a connection between us. 

She looks up when I reprimand Bitchsuited Sheila. I give her a smile to reassure her I'm not talking to her. She gives me a real small smile in return, then goes back to her reading, still seeming unsettled.

It's understandable. When these two came up to my office, they were a little disappointed their breakfasts were an egg Mcmuffin, three apple slices, and a pint carton of Orange Juice. I ate the exact same thing. I told them they were going to have a big breakfast with our dommes. Not a lie, Lara and Constance were going to treat them to a big breakfast from the kitchen before she takes them out.

Not knowing this, they probably assumed they were having the luxorious breakfast catered for my party when they arrived at Katie's resort. Zero and Border Bunny would wait tethered in the Slave Pens while we ate. They were probably afraid Katie would pull them away for Slave taskings, or make them wait with Zero and Border Bunny. Said a lot about Katie that they were clearly worried about it. Well, it's your lucky day, girls!

I'd been so lost in thought I hadn't noticed Border Bunny had been led out and tethered outside Constance's apartment facing the opposite wall. I giggled at the horses tail hanging out her butt, no doubt connected to her electrobutt plug. I switched to the front view. Her Hood mask had horse's ears on either side instead of pink bunny ears. Horse blinkers on either side of her head at eye level. A strict posture collar around her neck. It had a ring for a leash, but it looked like Dao tethered her to the wall eyelet with her clit leash.

""Slave Border Bunny, Sweetie, I know you're clit leashed, but could you back up a little without hurting yourself?"" I was gratified that I'd gotten the tough former Marine to look just a little nervous at the voice of her Chief Disciplinarian. She backed up, probably as much as she could without straining her cute little Hispanic woman bud.

""Good girl. You're not in any trouble. I just wanted to savor those big mocha tits a little better. Constance and I are going to tie you to a chair and lick them tonight when we get back. With your consent, of course."" Her eyes look a little annoyed, then her back straightens and she looks proud and lustful at her Disciplinarian's desire for her. Sure that consent won't be a problem.

The bottom slaves wait staring at the floor or the wall.  Their dommes and lovers sip coffee and chat in the quarters the slaves live in, just to emphasize their inferior status. Of course, in my book they're beautiful Queens, willing to play slaves to save others. I have fun topping them, but look forward to the day they get the respect they deserve again. But until that day, we all have our parts today.

The time goes fast as I play a Science Fiction game on my desktop, sipping coffee from Sheila's pot I'm borrowing while she's a slave. I look up as almost Simultaneously, Lara, Sandy and Mary leave the apartment to fetch Zero, and Constance, Sarah and Dao leave their loft to lead Border Bunny to the pick up area.

I look at Cindy, who seems to get it, putting the book back on my desk. I smile at her again. ""You can borrow it until you finish it when you get back."" She nods. ""Thank you, Mistress Nora."" Vivian switched from news to an old sitcom, with the state of the world, I can't blame her. I walk up, trying to think of a way to get her attention without startling her. Some slave sense alerts her and she takes off the headphones, turns off the TV, and stands obediently for my next command.

I nod thanks at her quick obedience and say ""let's roll, girls."" The slaves fall instep behind me, Cindy to the left, Viv to the right. I'm wearing a black skirt suit, Sandy will be wearing a similar Navy blue one. We'll change into casual clothes at the resort. Constance insisted while escorting slaves to another group's compound, Dommes will look professional, even if we're turning over custody to other dommes for most of the day.

I walk into the waiting area to Layla's cute butt to my right, Zero's to my left. Dao is in between them dressed as a horse jockey and playing with one of her nasty bamboo canes, smiling at me.

Dave walks up to me in what has to be his most expensive powersuit, flanked to his left by Constance, his right Lara, in similar female attire. I know the pomp and ceremony is necessary to portray us as serious players in the game, but it get's tiring at times.

I bow low, ""Master Henson."" He bows and then holds out his hand ""Chief Disciplinarian Of Slaves Jameson."" He pitches it high so there's no mistaking I have his full backing.

As we shake he pulls me in and whispers ""You've come along way, kid. We have faith in you. Remember to have faith in yourself. No shame calling for help if you need it."" He claps my shoulder then moves off as Constance takes my right hand, and Lara my left. 

""Sugar, you've dommed both of us before. And ain't no one Lara and I would trust more with our sweet girls then you and Sandy, chile."" Our Indian Boss speaks up ""It's true, we're worried about them, and you and Sandy. But you're ready for this, don't doubt it.""

Then a snide voice says ""Oh, this is so touching, brings a tear to my eye. Why does everyone have to make such a big deal over some jumped up, over privilged Alpha Slave?""

Jasmine! But she's not supposed to...! I turn to my left to see Jas about 20 feet away smirking at me. Sandy, in a Navy blue skirt suit, looks to be gearing up to pound her. Sarah in a light grey skirt suit is trying to talk her down. The Arab girl is dressed as casually as possible, in jeans and a pink capri top. So much for projecting dignity and professionalism.

Constance explains ""Katie insisted on providing a local guide f or y'alls trip. That would be ""Mistress Jasmine"". Constance turned to pin Jas with a fierce domme glare. ""However, if you don't show my Chief Disciplinarian the respect she's owed, I will personally remove you and tell Katie to have another domme meet us at the resort. And I'll recommend two weeks of remediation for you as a bottom slave. Under the lash of the ""jumped up slave"" you just insulted! Now apologize and address her properly!""

The snide girl actually looks sobered up by Constance's ""Angry Black Mama"" mode.
""I'm sorry....Mistress Nora."" She stammers out not looking at me. I address her. ""Jasmine, look at me, looking at your feet is slave behavior."" She reluctantly meets my gaze. 

""Treat me with due respect, I'll treat you with your due respect. This incident is dead, unless you mouth off to me again today. Are we clear MISTRESS Jasmine?""
She meets my gaze more steadily. ""Yes, Mistress Nora.""

I nod. But now the cat's out of the bag on Cindy and Vivian. They look confused and a little scared. They were supposed to be our local guides, they thought! And if Jasmine is coming with us...they clearly didn't want to be under her authority on Katie's turf. Rest easy, girls.

""Viv, stand facing Border Bunny, Cindy stand facing Zero."" The slaves comply, still looking confused. I notice both my poor girls are clit leashed to eyelets on the deck. Dao has already turned to cane them if needed, but the malicious smile over her shoulder tells me this is her work.

""Cindy, Vivian. You've worked hard in helping to mold two stubborn former dommes into barely acceptable bottom slaves. We've asked a lot, and you've delivered. We decided you two deserve a day of rest. Not only rest, but a catered breakfast, A shopping trip, a spa appointment, and a nice restaurant dinner. Mistress Katie generously provided some of your old clothes to go out in. It's all going to be paid for by these two bottoms you helped train. They have genourous checks and big bank accounts, you don't.
And they're very thankful to pay for their two Alphas day off, and for your training and leadership over them. Aren't you, girls?""

They were suprised, but their intelligence and our training had them quickly mmmphing obsequious thanks to their pleasantly shocked Alpha Slaves.
Dao had been itching to cane some slavegirl rump, now she looked disappointed.

I said ""Okay my little brown nosers, enough. It's good you're so genourous and grateful, but don't overdo it."" They obediently fell silent.

Lara addresses them ""Girls, come with me please. I'd really like to at least treat you to that breakfast. If you want to rest in your rooms all day you can, but I hope you'll take the full package your Betas are paying for.""

Cindy and Vivian look at each other. I heard they were once friends, but on set as slaves, they seem to have a cold distance between them. This time they seem to be in perfect agreement. Vivian moves close to hug Border Bunny, as Cindy crouches down to hug Zero. They quietly thank their Betas.

Dao, Mary and Jasmine look outraged at this show of slave solidarity. But our turf, our rules, they need our leave to discipline them. They look around for support none of us will give. They may have forgotten slaves are still people, we haven't.

They back off from their embraces and follow a softly smiling Lara to their breakfast. ""Bunch of softies."" murmurs Jasmine. 

I look at my phone. The transport is here. ""Mary, Jasmine and I will load up first in the Domme's module. Once we're settled in, Sandy, you Mary and Sarah load the slaves in their pens and secure them, then join us in the Domme's module.

The Dommes module was at the front of the container, and was made as luxorious as possible, entered through a side door. The slaves were loaded into their pens in the back. They had to watch their dommes relax comfortably the entire trip while they were penned up uncomfortablely like animals. With the electro Butt plugs, we didn't even need to move to discipline them. 

Sandy technically should join Jasmine and I while the Trainee Domme and the Alpha Slave loaded up the pets. But despite their cordiality this time, I didn't want Mary trying to pull rank. Sending my executive domme to help them sent a clear message who was in charge. I was grateful for Sandy's humility and grasp of what I waz doing. As myself, Dao and Jasmine moved to load up, I hear her ordering Mary and Sarah to inspect the slave's bondage carefully.

We're going back to Katie's. I let the thought really hit me. Maybe not the belly of the beast. But I had a feeling our sus ally was the jaws...

As the owner of a MUD, and a long time player of MUDs in general, I saw how tedious it was to create unique colored strings. On top of that, it can be quite difficult to come up with some new variants of colored strings. On that note, I've built a tool with simplifies the process, so that instead of taking MINUTES to do colored strings, you can do it in seconds. Just type what you want, and select the colors. BAM.

[https://github.com/Coffee-Nerd/MUD-Colorizer](https://github.com/Coffee-Nerd/MUD-Colorizer)

The tool can be found on my GitHub, there, and if you love it please give it a star :) 

You can actually play with it here:  
[https://coffee-nerd.github.io/MUD-Colorizer/](https://coffee-nerd.github.io/MUD-Colorizer/)

Just select your format, type in the text box, select your colors, and enjoy!

I have added a few different variations of color codes from a few different muds, but if you would like to add more please send through a pull request. I made this open source to benefit the community, so if you would like to add more gradients (there are soooo many more we can add), or add a new feature, just do a PR or just let me know.

I would also like to add background colors to it, but many MUDs handle that very differently.   
I have ANOTHER tool which does something similar to this, but let's start here. :)

In November 2013, Ukraine was poised to sign the European Union-Ukraine Association Agreement, which  would have forged closer ties between Ukraine and the EU, helping to free Ukraine from russia's sphere of influence. Just before he was due to sign it, then-president Viktor Yanukovych suddenly turned his back on it. He chose instead to tie Ukraine inextricably to russia with the russian-Ukrainian action plan, which would have indebted Ukraine to russia and kept it firmly in russia's sphere.

Ukrainians, who'd been eagerly anticipating this turn away from russia and toward the EU, were outraged. With this simple, pleasant Facebook post, Afghan-Ukrainian journalist Mustafa Nayyem summoned about 1500 Ukrainians to a rally on Maidan Nezaleazhnosti (Independence Square), kicking off the juggernaut that became the Revolution of Dignity.",9,1739596172.0,ukraine,3,1.0,False

1ipu2es,https://www.reddit.com/r/hungary/comments/1ipu2es/thinking_of_hungary_everyday/,Thinking of Hungary Everyday,"

I lived in Budapest for four years. Initially, I was very apprehensive about the city and its people because this was my first time outside India, living alone, knowing no one around.

I landed in Budapest in March 2018. Work in the Budapest office was very different due to the multicultural environment. In India, work always came first and last.

My boss/supervisor was tough on me because she was Hungarian and believed my job position should have been given to another European.

My dreams were shattered, but somehow, I managed. I brought my family (wife and child) in August 2018, and they settled in well. My wife made good friends in the Indian community. My daughter was just three years old, and her international school accommodated her well. This motivated me a lot‚ÄîI wanted them to have a great life. So, I decided to continue in Budapest and took up the challenges at work. I spent countless hours understanding my role, getting along with the team, and slowly, my boss saw my dedication and started supporting me completely.

I truly enjoyed Hungary and traveled to a few places. Unlike India, it was not crowded, and public transport was incredibly convenient. People valued time management, and the work-life balance was wonderful‚Äîso peaceful. I started making good friends in Budapest, met nice people from the Indian community, and felt on top of the world. Budapest truly swept me off my feet. I felt like I belonged to the city. I knew the places, picked up basic Hungarian, and even planned to bring my parents to visit.

Then, in 2020, COVID hit. None of us knew what was happening. I had already planned my vacation to India in March 2020, so I traveled back. Due to travel restrictions, I had to stay until October 2020, and my parents couldn‚Äôt visit Budapest as planned.

I landed back in BP in October 2020. Work continued, but my parents in India were worried about the situation. They wanted me to return, but BP had become a part of me. I couldn‚Äôt decide. I asked my wife and child if they could move to India to take care of my parents, and they agreed. In May 2021, we traveled to India, and I left them there before returning to BP.

The minute I landed at the airport, I felt like I was carrying something heavy. I started missing my family terribly. After so much joy, fun, and laughter with my wife and daughter, suddenly, everything felt still. My mind sank into deep depression. My home in BP, once filled with my daughter's laughter and my wife's presence, now felt empty and lifeless. I was lost. Depressed. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I managed my household chores, worked, and prayed.

After COVID, visits to the office became less frequent, reducing social interactions. My mind oscillated between my home in India and my life in BP.
BP filled my heart, but home in India was calling too.

I started eating at odd hours, drinking, and sinking into depression. My body gave up. I began experiencing body pain, fatigue, rashes, and exhaustion. Juggling work, household chores, and hospital visits became overwhelming. The cold weather made it worse. Cough, fever, joint pain, body rashes‚Äîcombined with the loneliness‚Äîpushed me deeper into despair.

Then came the diagnosis: liver disease, thyroid issues, and an autoimmune disorder. I never knew I could cry so hard. I couldn't take it. Fatigue consumed me.

Somehow, I gathered the strength to talk to a few friends who gave me confidence. I didn‚Äôt disclose my condition to my family because I knew they would worry too much.

In March 2022, I left BP and returned to India.

From then until today, not a single day has passed without thinking about Hungary and my Budapest. My health has improved, but I‚Äôm still not free from the illness. I wake up in pain and go to bed with pain.

Every day, I pray to the gods of Budapest to heal me. There‚Äôs a saying: You will find what you lost in the place where you lost it. I have asked for forgiveness from all. I want to go back and be better.

I long to walk along the shores of the Danube, light a candle in the church, sit across from Parliament for hours, visit Balaton, climb the hills, and grab a coffee.

It has been almost three years of suffering. BP lives in my heart.

To anyone reading this long post‚Äîthank you. Send me your love and wishes for healing. I want to return to Budapest with the same happiness.

Thank you.

Me (25f) and my husband of two years(32M) have issues. Lots of issues.

It‚Äôs too much details to go into right now, but the fact is that despite name calling, and his constant ignoring and horrible communication and emotional regulation, I‚Äôm trying so hard to fix our relationship. 

We recently did start going to therapy thank goodness, but only now I find out from my husband (!) while he was high and tired and upset during an argument that there‚Äôs a girl that really likes him at a local Starbucks.

He started going a bit into detail that he supposedly had a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù friendship with her when he picked up his daily coffee, and she asked him if he was single and he said he was married and he felt (supposedly) uncomfortable about all of it.

Yet he goes to this Starbucks often and he chats here and there with her, claiming that she usually initiates it. There is a Starbucks 4 minutes away and he goes there a lot yet he visits the 10 minute drive Starbucks where she usually works at. 

He told me that it‚Äôs not wrong to chit chat with girls, fine, I can agree. But‚Ä¶

After a huge fight where things got horrible and I told him ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt shape up in this relationship I‚Äôll have no choice but to divorce you‚Äù he told her that his wife might be divorcing him and she was really happy about it, and he even told her that if she wanted to marry him she shouldn‚Äôt bother him because he is a busy businessman (real estate) and she agreed.

And my husband is religious, soooo religious that he claims he will only be intimate if married to a religious woman, and he told her this and she agreed to convert only if she could marry him. 

My husband says that she is a lot sweeter than me, that she‚Äôs pretty too, and that she‚Äôs not as emotional as me and that‚Äôs what he wants. A girl that doesn‚Äôt need a man to be involved in a relationship that requires you to listen and show you care, provide and be there during the rough times and not only the good ones. 

He says if I ever leave him this is who he will take, she‚Äôs his backup and he likes her I can tell. 

I don‚Äôt actually want a divorce I really want this relationship to work but I feel like with this news everything is crashing down. I have a child from a previous relationship, and one child with him. If I do leave him and find someone else and start a family, imagine having 3 kids from 3 different fathers. I know it‚Äôs a stupid thought but that‚Äôs one thought I have. 

One more thing:
I was able to discreetly access his phone and Google account, and looked through everything and haven‚Äôt found any evidence of actual cheating. I checked his frequent locations, his emails, his photos, his trash, all random apps, everything. I think he‚Äôs clean on that end.

Summary: 
Crowley and Aziraphale have admired one another from afar but have never spoken to one another. Knowing this, Maggie and Nina take some initiative and they've helped Crowley arrange dinner on Valentine's Day.

Excerpt:
‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt know of whom you speak, my dear,‚Äù he said, sipping his hot chocolate through the plastic lid as primly as possible.

‚ÄúThe ginger with the long hair, Mr. Fell. The goth with the triple-jointed hips that sway like a Foucault‚Äôs Pendulum? With the old-timey black car? That one,‚Äù Maggie glanced over at Nina, and they exchanged a look. 

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Aziraphale said, very interested in his drink. ‚ÄúHe asked about me?‚Äù 

Maggie smiled into her coffee while Nina rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYes, he did. He wanted to know why you always appear in the window when he appears. He wanted to know what you liked to drink. And he wanted to know your name.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat did you tell him?‚Äù Aziraphale asked, inspecting his nails as if not at all interested in the answer.

What do you think?,"I (27F) have gone on two dates with a guy (32 M). We first matched on hinge in December, right after Christmas. I really enjoyed the first date but it took almost a month to plan because of how spaced out our texts were. We had dinner and drinks. He stood out among all the other guys I‚Äôve gone out with. I felt like he was really thoughtful in planning the date. He picked places based on things I said I liked and things that were close to me but out of the way for him in terms of distance. He really listened to me when I talked. I mentioned something kind of personal/stressful I had gone through with work. And I was like but I don‚Äôt want to dwell on that right now. And he said no, it‚Äôs okay. I don‚Äôt mind and reached across the table to hold my hand. I don‚Äôt know, it felt very sweet. After the date, he walked me to my car and kissed me. He was like I was thinking about that all night. And he kissed me under these lights, it felt like a movie. I felt giddy afterwards. Then, he went out of town so our next date wasn‚Äôt scheduled for two weeks. And, there was a snowstorm the day of so I texted him to see if he wanted to cancel. We both agreed we still wanted to go out to this movie I suggested. He held my hand the entire time, we kissed on this date again, but we had to end after that because of the weather. So I think our mutual willingness to go and see each other when we live like 30 minutes away from one another in 6 inches of snow means we like each other. And we planned a third date. 

But the texting is so bad. Like 
day 1, do you want to go out? ‚ÄúYes‚Äù 
day 2 ‚Äúwould u prefer coffee or drinks? ‚ÄúDrinks‚Äù day 3 what night are you free? 

That‚Äôs how bad it is. After our second date, I put my dating profile on pause because I did feel hopeful about our connection but honestly I‚Äôve been getting a ton of dates and was feeling burnt out meeting new people. So now that my focus is more on him, I‚Äôm more aware of his lack of responsiveness. I mentioned it after the second date that I‚Äôd like him to respond quicker so it‚Äôs easier to make plans. And he said yeah sorry, I‚Äôm just not good at texting. My experience tells me that‚Äôs always a lie. Whenever a guy is interested, he texts. You don‚Äôt have to question his interest because of lack of texts. Like a guy who likes you, you will never be confused about. Part of me feels like I should end it because the fact that I care about it at all shows I‚Äôm already emotionally involved on some level. And I‚Äôd rather end early before actually getting hurt. But on the other hand. Both dates are great, we agreed to go out. I‚Äôm like why end it when things are going well in person? But I really don‚Äôt want to be hurt. At my age 27, I see every date I spend with the wrong person as delaying meeting the right person. So that‚Äôs why I normally cut things off sooner rather than later if they‚Äôre not a good fit. But my dating burnout is bad enough (i went on dates with about 8 people in the past 2 months) that I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs wasting time because I need a break from meeting new people anyway. Just really don‚Äôt want to be hurt again. ",2,1739594607.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

The whole walk back I just felt mad.

I fucking hate that I'm like this, that I have this problem. I wish I could just be a normal person and enjoy some drinks without flushing my life down the toilet. It's infuriating and I hate that I have to constantly grapple with this stupid fucking voice in my head. The whole time it's telling me, ""You could just drink 2, couldn't you? Just get a good buzz and sleep it off. You wouldn't even feel it tomorrow.""

Of course that goes from two cans, to two tallboys, to two 9% 20 Ozers.

I stood in the coffee aisle for a couple minutes, painfully remembering all those other times I was ""only gonna have two."" Forcing myself to recall how I'd wake up to a body covered in phantom injuries and a phone full of humiliating messages.

However, today as I was in the office with others while the probationary firings were happening - it was cathartic to cry together, hug, share resources like this sub, and talk about how much this sucks.  A friend in another department texted me when she was about to lose it and we went for coffee to compare notes.  It was much less isolating and less scary than if I‚Äôd been at home on Teams, and I‚Äôd forgotten how much I missed that sense of community.  Also there was less tangible evidence of our conversations, another side benefit.

Again, to be clear - this did not make us more efficient, in fact we were much less efficient this afternoon.  Very little other work was done.  But it was a small comfort to have company to share the shittiness with, and I‚Äôm wondering if return to office will have the unintended side effect of making it easier to endure whatever else comes our way.

Now before anyone asks I want to clarify that my aunt doesn't do anything around the house. She goes out to drop her son at school then comes back with him around 6 in evening. After that she stays in her room and we have to give her food in her room. I don't really know how to explain the reasons behind it but it's just how this is and honestly I didn't even expect her to help me. She won't help me and I don't want her help. 

  
Few days back when my mom told me that they'll be out for two days, I asked her to tell my brother to help me in chores. My brother has a huge appetite like he eats for two tbh and he doesn't know how to cook. That leaves me to cook all the meals for all of us. I like cooking but I like it as a hobby not as a chore. Even when my mom is home I don't cook. My duty is to wash all the dishes of the day,  do any cleaning that includes dust (because my mom is asthmatic) and help her at dinner time which usually takes around 10 mins and doesn't actually includes me cooking, mostly it's chopping the veggies or serving. I chose my tasks myself and I'm happy with them.

My brother was supposed to help in other stuff except cooking but he hasn't done anything since yesterday.

  
Let me tell you what happened‚Äî 

  
I woke up at 5 yesterday and while my parents were getting ready, I made grilled sandwiches for them to eat and also packed some to take with them. They had a train at 6:30 so they left at 6. Then I tidied all the mess, washed the dishes, made coffee for myself and tea for my aunt. After that she left too. I studied for some hours then took a break, made sandwiches for myself. I have an exam in few months so I need to study for it. Around 12 my brother woke up. He came straight to the kitchen and started asking me why there was no warm water for him to drink. It annoyed me so much but I didn't want to argue because I needed him to co-operate with me for two days. I boiled some water then he came back after an hour to ask for food so I made sandwiches for him. I thought I won't have to make lunch but he came to ask for more food in two hours. There wasn't anymore bread at home so I took out last night's leftovers from the fridge. It was just curry so I had to make dough and roll chapatis. For those who didn't understand I had to work another half hour to make a meal. And for some reason my aunt came home early so I had to give lunch to her too.

  
At night when I was making dinner I asked my brother if he would keep an eye on the pot at stove because I had to go take a bath. He didn't have to do anything just turn it off at right time. He knows how to do that. But he said I should take a bath later or make it dinner later. I don't want all the smell from kitchen on my clothes when I go to sleep so I made dinner first and by the time I came out of bath the dinner was cold and I had to eat it cold. I had made my favourite one pot rice recipe with my favourite two side dishes. I was crying while eating it. It couldn't be reheated. I wanted to have a nice comfort meal and he destroyed it.

  
I was really angry and frustrated so I couldn't study and scrolled through social media before going to sleep at 2. Before bed, I had to check all locks and stove and lights but I forgot and only remembered it when I was in bed. I told my brother to do it but he made some useless excuse so I had to go do that too.

  
Now he was supposed to go to sleep at 3 or 4 but he didn't. When we woke up at 8:30 today he was still watching animes on his laptop that's what he's been doing since he woke up yesterday at 12. I asked when will he sleep but he said he doesn't feel sleepy so he can't tell me a time. He needs to fucking sleep. It's not just because it's bad for his health to stay awake for a whole day or that he has exams in ten days, but also because if he doesn't fucking sleep now he'll sleep in the evening and all the night and wake up tomorrow morning when my parents will come back so I'll have to do all the cleaning, dishes, cooking, all other thousand things myself. He knows I prefer to do that stuff the evening before they come back so it stays clean when they're back and I don't have to redo it.

  
I'm so fucking angry. I was trying to be understanding, our dad is super strict and a fucking narcissist and we had a tense week with some arguments here and there between my parents so I thought he wanted to take a break from everything and relax. And that's okay I understand it. I didn't tell him to study even though mom told me to do that. I just asked him to sleep now so he can wake up in evening and help me in chores. I can't do that alone. I'm already tired by all the cooking I did yesterday. My arms and legs hurt. I cant do it alone anymore.

  
I'm thinking about calling mom and telling her about his behaviour. She should be at her brother's house while my dad completes whatever work he had at a different place( like half an hour drive away) so I'm thinking about calling her and after I make sure dad isn't there I'll tell her about my brother's behaviour. I don't want dad to know about this and punish my brother but I can't deal with this anymore. 

  
But I'm not sure if it's the right thing to do. What if I ruin the only two free days my brother has and he gets upset at me. Or mom gets angry at him and says something to him and he blames me for it. Will I be an asshole if I went ahead with me plan? Can anyone give me a better advice?",8,1739594102.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\

Get off this device and show appreciation to your spouse. 

- Say thank you for something s/he has done for you or your household (you and your spouse and kids).
- give her/him a hug/a peck on the cheek etc 
- make them a cup of tea/coffee etc without them asking or them needing one 
- do something they like ( for example my husband loves it when I put lotion on his hands and feet, but he will never do it himself)

1iptgo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iptgo6/should_i_have_said_something/,Should I have said something?,"I have no idea what forum to ask.

I‚Äôve thought about going on her page and saying not very nice things to call her out, however, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the best thing to do. I haven‚Äôt said a single thing to her, I didn‚Äôt then, and I still haven‚Äôt now. Is that the best option??

I, (16, female) live with my father (40, male). His girlfriend (41, female) had moved in a few months ago. She was only supposed to stay about a month or 2, just until she had money to go live on her own. I say ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù because it‚Äôs an easy label, they haven‚Äôt dated in a really long time, but she has talked about starting a relationship with him a few times. 

To try and put everything out, not only did she stay for about 6-7 months, but her 18 year old son stayed in my brother‚Äôs room for about 4-5 months as well. 

She didn‚Äôt contribute to any house payments or chores, other than feeding her animals and ours. She brought her 2 small dogs and 2 cats to stay with her in our home (we have a dog and 2 cats, so it was really crowded lol). She also left most messes; coffee filled mugs, dirty dishes, random bras on the kitchen table, swimsuits on the ground. 

From then on, it just got worse. She wasn‚Äôt a fan of me, and I really didn‚Äôt like her from the start. What had me leaving my father‚Äôs home to stay with my mother was the fight she had had.

I was in my father‚Äôs room, watching a TV show that just updated their last season with all the episodes. She came ‚Äúhome‚Äù after being out for about 8 hours, my father was worried about her (she hadn‚Äôt been responding to any text messages or even told him she was going to be out late). She had said she needed to stop by work to grab paperwork. When she did finally get ‚Äúhome‚Äù she REKEAD of alcohol, my father did not want her near him.

The argument started over lies and other drama they had from smaller arguments. I left the room, however, that‚Äôs when I probably should have stayed. Yelling transpired, a battle of ‚Äúhe said, she said‚Äù broke out. My father had placed his hand over her mouth so she would stop saying ‚Äúyou short, pathetic, sad, balding man‚Äù over and over again. She proceeded to bite his hand, punch his face, and scratch at his arms. The evidence of blood, from biting his hand, was left on her white blouse after he pushed her away from him. 

She had finally spotted me when she was ridiculing him for his mother and father both passing away. Mimicking him, with a child like voice, saying ‚Äúoh, poor me, my parents died‚Äù as she proceeded to call him immature.

I wish it had stopped there, however, it was a constant of her driving back and forth. We never kicked her out, yet she drove to an empty parking lot. She was texting my father about how she has to sleep in her car and how it‚Äôs all his fault. She talked about how it would be our fault if she crashed her car and died (mind you, she is under the influence still). She constantly mentioned how her son would be so very sad if his mother had died. 

At one point she called my father, started sobbing, and then hung up. When she did get back (she had the garage door opener), we had locked all the other door (it was around 2am when this all transpired). When came around the back and started banging on the side door, repeating words like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to murder you‚Äù ‚Äúopen this f*cking door‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to kill you‚Äù and so forth. 

We blew up an air mattress for her to sleep in the living room, her son had been sleeping on the couch, since my brother was staying there for the weekend. 

Unfortunately she had been texting my father about how I am a whore, that sleeps around, and has an inappropriate relationship with my father and brother. I really really wish she hadn‚Äôt said anything about me, I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. I felt horrible for having been called awful things by a 40 year old woman, but, she had threatened to spread the word around to our neighbors. Thankfully, she didn‚Äôt. 

I had to leave, for my safety, and mental health. She didn‚Äôt leave until about a month and a half after I left. She had said I was selfish for leaving. 

I do understand she was under the influence, and I‚Äôm aware she has had a rough childhood, and life for that matter. I won‚Äôt go into details of the abuse she endured, I just know that she wasn‚Äôt and problem still isn‚Äôt healed from everything. 

To this day I feel horrible for NOT saying anything, but maybe it was best I didn‚Äôt.

I felt the need to get this out there, because I‚Äôm driving myself crazy. Having one conversations in my head, in my dreams, it‚Äôs not good for me. 

Was it best to never have said anything?
How do I just get her and the situation out of my head entirely?

I hope nothing came across as rude at all. I just need some advice. Please and thank you!

Hoedspruit might not be the first place that comes to mind when planning a trip, but it‚Äôs one of those destinations that surprises you in the best way.

Hoedspruit is surrounded by game reserves, meaning you don‚Äôt have to go far for a proper safari experience. Whether it‚Äôs a guided game drive in Balule, a visit to the Hoedspruit Endangered Species Centre, or exploring the surrounding wilderness, there‚Äôs no shortage of ways to see South Africa‚Äôs incredible wildlife

Just a short drive from town, the Blyde River Canyon offers some of the most breathtaking views in the country. Whether you take a boat cruise on the dam, hike to one of the viewpoints, or go all out with a helicopter flip, it‚Äôs an experience you won‚Äôt forget.  


For a small town, Hoedspruit has an impressive selection of restaurants. Start your morning with coffee at The Fig & Bean, grab a relaxed lunch at Sleepers Railway Station, and end the day with sundowners at Three Bridges. If you‚Äôre after a proper bush dining experience, The Hat & Creek is the place to be.  


Hoedspruit is one of those places where things move at their own pace. It‚Äôs got a mix of conservationists, adventurers, and travellers, all adding to its unique charm. Whether you‚Äôre browsing the local markets, chatting with locals, or just unwinding in nature, it‚Äôs the kind of town that makes you want to stay longer.
