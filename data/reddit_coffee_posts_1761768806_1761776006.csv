I guess to begin with, l'd love to meet you and cuddle. BUT we both are random people on the internet. So let's take our time to get to know one another. Im not saying that we need to wait months on end but like a week or so. Or until you are comfortable with meeting.

With meeting said, I'm pretty much fine with doing mostly whatever you would want to do. I'm not really picky on most things just a few (I make a list). But I would like to meet in a public place first since of course we are strangers, something like getting a bite to eat or getting a drink (boba or coffee or whatever) first would be nice. But I guess I should say a bit more on what l like and don't.

There's a long list of things I like to do but I don't feel like writing a biography. So here's a handful of things I like to do, I like going to museums and looking at the art (obviously) and imagine what the painter was thinking along with what the painting means to me or you, seeing movies in the theatre's (or relaxing at home with a nice blanket and watching them), window shopping and looking at all the things that I can't afford or just shouldn't buy, trying new foods (not much I haven't tried already but there's some), listening to music 24/7, going to concerts, and lastly getting boba or tropical smoothie. There is probably more to that list but I just can't think of everything.

üìñ read on if you a like a good long post...

**ABOUT ME:**

Hey, I'm Jordan - 31 years old, male, straight, born and raised in the UK üá¨üáß. I work full-time as an electronics product tester (yes, it‚Äôs as cool as it sounds, ask me anything about it). I‚Äôm a bit of a notification addict, so I reply fast. Right now I‚Äôm on a health kick and making big lifestyle changes to match, already dropped down 16kg / 35lbs! 

---

**HOBBIES:**

Gaming is my go-to hobby and what I spend most of my free time doing. Primarily a PC gamer, but also own a Switch 2 (and Steam Deck!) Currently playing PowerWash Simulator 2 and BALL x PIT - I have a vast library of games across Steam and Switch, plus whatever is on Gamepass. I'm open to playing most games, especially co-op titles but actively **avoid** playing MMOs, MOBAs or any competitive shooters. Perhaps you could suggest a game we might enjoy together?

As of late I'm looking into cross stitching as I think it's a really neat form of art! I'd love to get started and start making some Kirby themed designs via Esty kits I've seen online - anyone with experience, send me your beginner tips!!

Besides games, I love to watch TV and movies (especially streaming them to other people and watching together) - not so much a big music fan, but I do have a single playlist on Spotify where I dump all my favourite songs on there lmao

---

**SOCIALIZING:**

I‚Äôm a people person and always up for getting to know someone on a deeper level. I'm looking for a kind of platonic energy that has slipped through my fingers in the past - someone who's enjoy daily conversation, exchanging photos and voice notes and generally interested in conversation, rather than just replying to messages. Huge fan of voice calls and would much rather sit in a call together than texting. My social battery can vary from day to day, from being incredibly responsive to complete potato mode - unless I'm asleep, I'm always readily available (even at work!) 

***I'm usually available for voice calls / games in the evenings (9pm onwards GMT) or weekend mornings (8am - 4pm GMT), but otherwise I can text anytime!***

---

**RANDOM TIDBITS:**

Been lucky enough to travel around the world to places like Tokyo, California (x7) and Prague! I currently have two tattoos on my shoulder and my wrist (pics for the cool kids), serial picky eater (way worse than you think...) and I've even met THREE other users from Reddit IRL (all still alive, promise!)

The marble floor of the old exchange is cracked, but the bell still hangs like a trophy over a room now cluttered with maps, monitors, and banana peel compost bins.

Outside, New York hums with distant sirens and the occasional celebratory whoop from apes testing homemade airhorns.

‚ÄúMorale is down but not out,‚Äù the General rumbles, his voice like gravel run through a blender. ‚ÄúWe need a spark. We need him.‚Äù The name hangs between everyone: Roaring Kitty.

This happened two weeks ago. I'm still reeling. My husband and I had been together for eight years, married for five. We had what I thought was a solid marriage. Good jobs, nice house, we never really fought much. But honestly, things had gotten boring. Really boring.

About six months ago I started working late a lot. There was this guy at the office. Younger than me, funny, paid attention when I talked. We started having drinks after work. One night it went further. I told myself it was just stress relief, just one time. But it wasn't one time. It happened maybe four or five times over three months.

My husband never suspected anything. He just kept being his normal self. Making dinner when I worked late. Asking how my day was. Kissing me goodnight. And for some reason that made me angrier. Like he was too trusting. Too naive. Part of me wanted him to notice, to care enough to be jealous or suspicious.

Then two weeks ago we had this stupid argument. I can't even remember what started it. Something about me spending too much time at work maybe. He said something like, ""I feel like you're not really here anymore.""

And I just snapped.

""Maybe I'm not,"" I said. ""Maybe I've been getting what I need somewhere else.""

He froze. Just stared at me. ""What are you talking about?""

I should have backed down. I should have lied. But something in me wanted to hurt him. Wanted to see a reaction. Any reaction.

""I slept with someone from work,"" I said. I actually smirked. I remember smirking. ""Multiple times actually. And honestly? I'd do it again.""

The look on his face. God. It was like I'd physically hit him. His eyes went wide and then just blank. Empty.

""Are you serious?"" His voice was so quiet.

""Dead serious,"" I said. I was still angry, still wanting to prove some point I can't even explain now. ""What are you going to do about it?""

He didn't yell. Didn't cry. He just nodded slowly and walked upstairs to our bedroom. Closed the door.

I stood there feeling this weird mix of satisfaction and dread. I thought maybe we'd have a big fight the next morning. Maybe he'd cry and I'd apologize and we'd go to counseling or something. I don't know what I expected. Maybe part of me thought he'd just forgive me because he always forgave everything.

The next morning I woke up around seven. The bed next to me was empty but made. Perfectly made, hospital corners and everything. That should have been my first clue.

I went downstairs expecting coffee, maybe breakfast. I know how that sounds now. But in my head I thought we'd talk, hash it out, figure things out like adults.

The kitchen was spotless. No coffee brewing. No note. His keys were gone from the hook by the door. His wallet was gone. I checked the garage. His car was gone.

I called his phone. Straight to voicemail. I called his work. They said he'd called in sick. I called again an hour later. Voicemail. Again at lunch. Voicemail.

By that evening I was panicking. I called his brother. His brother answered on the first ring.

""Don't call this number again,"" he said. His voice was ice cold.

""Where is he?"" I asked. ""Is he okay?""

""He's fine. He's safe. That's all you need to know.""

""Safe from what? From me? I need to talk to him.""

""No,"" his brother said. ""You really don't. Lose this number.""

He hung up. When I tried calling back it went straight to a disconnected message. He'd blocked me.

I drove to his brother's house. No one answered. I could see lights on inside but no one came to the door.

I tried his parents next. His mom answered. The woman who used to hug me every time she saw me, who called me her daughter.

""Please don't come here,"" she said. Her voice was shaking but firm. ""You've done enough.""

""I just need to talk to him,"" I said. I was crying by then. ""Please. I made a mistake. I was angry. I didn't mean it.""

""You meant it,"" she said. ""You looked him in the eye and told him you'd do it again. Those were your words.""

""I was just upset, I...""

""He showed us the texts,"" she said quietly. ""From your phone. The ones you sent to that man. Planning times to meet. Talking about him. About my son. Laughing about it.""

My stomach dropped. I'd forgotten about those texts. Stupid, careless texts where I'd complained about my husband being boring, where I'd joked about the affair.

""Please,"" I whispered. ""Just let me explain.""

""There's nothing to explain,"" she said. ""He's done. We're done. Don't contact this family again.""

She hung up.

Over the next week I found out just how thoroughly he'd left. He'd moved all his important documents out of the house. Changed all his passwords. Moved money from our joint account into a separate one I couldn't access. Filed for divorce. His lawyer contacted me with papers.

His entire family had helped him. Coordinated it. They'd all known what he was planning and they'd all helped him disappear from my life in less than twenty-four hours.

I tried everything. I sent emails he never opened. I left voicemails that were never returned. I showed up at his gym, his favorite coffee shop. Nothing. It was like he'd become a ghost.

His coworker, the one friend of his who would still talk to me, finally told me the truth last week over coffee. My husband had apparently recorded our conversation that night. The whole thing. Me admitting to the affair. Me saying I'd do it again. Me smirking while I destroyed our marriage.

He'd played it for his family the next morning. They'd all been there, at his brother's house, when I woke up alone. His mom had helped him pack. His dad had helped him move money and find a lawyer. His brother had helped him block me on everything. They'd planned the whole exit strategy while I slept.

""He's not coming back,"" his friend told me. ""I've never seen him like this. He's just empty when anyone mentions you. Like you're already dead to him.""

The divorce papers came with a list of everything he wants. It's fair, actually. More than fair. He's not trying to destroy me financially. He just wants out. Clean break. No contact.

I've been living in this house alone for two weeks now. My job found out about the affair because the guy I was seeing apparently has a girlfriend who works there too. She made sure everyone knew. I'm getting transferred to a different department. Demoted, basically.

My own parents are barely speaking to me. They loved him. Everyone loved him. And I'm the one who threw it all away because I was bored and wanted to see him hurt.

I keep replaying that moment. Me smirking, saying I'd do it again. The look on his face. If I could take it back I would. I'd take all of it back. But I can't.

I guess what I'm asking is, am I really the villain here for expecting a chance to explain, to fix things, when his whole family helped him vanish like I was some kind of dangerous person?

I don‚Äôt have a village where we live so it‚Äôs been so lovely to be back home for a few weeks despite the 25h trip. 
Yesterday I took my daughter to the restaurant with me because she napped in her carrier. I met with my cousin who used to word regret when she talked about her 2 under 2. 

This morning she blessed me with a 8:30 am start to the day today which felt like a lay in (thank you time difference), my mum then played with her while I had a long shower and read some of my book. We then contact napped while I watched one of my favourite movies from childhood. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about getting her to sleep quickly or independently because I have only one child to attend to. The house was quiet, just the movie playing. It‚Äôs still a bit too warm but I was wishing for snow in that moment. 

I then let her crawl around a bit in the bathroom while I did my makeup and hair. I really struggled with feeling like myself postpartum and I‚Äôm so glad that I have some time back now to make myself feel ok again. I didn‚Äôt have to rush. Obviously baby was playing with my brushes and clawing on my leg but it‚Äôs those moments where I think if I‚Äôm a bit overestimated now, I know I am not one to handle this times 2 or 3. 

We then went outside and met a friend of mine who opened up a spa and was kind enough to gift me a facial. Because I only have one baby, my cousin was able to take her to get coffee in the meantime. She has bad separation anxiety at the moment but we shall ignore that part.

It‚Äôs just been wonderful only having to carry one child onto public transport or around a busy shopping centre. I showed her the Christmas lights which she loved and I didn‚Äôt have a reason to rush life at any point today. 
I‚Äôm currently eating a piece of homemade cake in bed, baby is asleep and it‚Äôs so quiet. Sometimes when I put her to bed I think at least only one child will wake me up during the night.
I‚Äôm just so privileged to have my daughter and so lucky that I got to show her around my home town and introduce her to all my friends. 

I think about this often but just knowing how I am able to soak up all her firsts, her moments of excitement when seeing or feeling something new, her big emotions that I can focus on without being distracted, just seeing her grow up without putting her second place ever, it just brings me so much joy.

Our Breville Express gave up the ghost last year and I wanted to use this as an opportunity to upgrade our entire setup. Then, reality - in the form of competing family expenses - intervened.

My wife found an old Breville infuser on fb for a couple of hundred bucks and we used a (the horror) blade grinder, which ... I mean ... typical morning conversation: ""would you like some shitty coffee?"" ""no thanks, it's too depressing"".

Meanwhile, I'm perusing all the machines out there and trying to figure out if maybe we could get by on a Gaggia classic, but no PID, and what about this Profitec Go but it won't fit under the counter .. hey this Ascaso PID machine looks perfect, except it's um .. 2k, which is like more than half what we paid for our oven .. but you know ONE DAY the kids will be out of the house and we'll have money to spend on ourselves and we will finally get that machine and also (ahem) a decent grinder...  
  
In the meantime, shitty coffee. Somehow I always put the two things together, because damn it I hate this stupid old infuser. And then, for my wife's b-day I found a really great deal (< $400 CAD) on a Mignon Facile. Ordered it up.  
  
Can you believe it? Actually getting pretty decent pours out of that crappy old machine. Beautiful crema, deep complex flavour, not a bit nasty or bitter.

I'm not gonna say I'm not still hankering for a machine that has some kind of real pressure control, hell even an actual metal tamper rather than the plastic (!) thing that came with it, some kind of decent temperature regulation, etc.. but  
  
Bottom line is that I think everyone could benefit from upgrading their grinder \*first\*. It's not that ""the grinder is just as important"". At this point I really do feel like the maker is the 20% of the equation and the grinder is the 80%. And like everything else, there is a sweet spot. I can't think of any good reason you'd need to spend more than $400 on a nearly perfect grinder which coincidentally is about the same as the most basic machine.",3,1761775249.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Texas, USA","I realized I did mis-represent the dates for each of these meals since day 1 I didn‚Äôt get any food due to the hour I finally got settled into a room. So days 1-4 was more 2-4. I‚Äôm just going to continue counting the days wrong to stay consistent. These are the last 2 days of meals from my stay.

I‚Äôm still recovering at home. I was discharged on October 23rd and with staying on a bland diet at home mixed with antibiotics and pain meds, the pain has lessened. I‚Äôm starting to feel I may be on the mend, although still having some extreme pain episodes, just less often.

I didn‚Äôt note on previous posts, but by the time the food got to me (literally every single meal) it had been between 1-3 hours after it was prepared based on the time written on the food receipt. Every hot item served was like warm at best and every cold item was near room temperature. I tried to let taste take charge when rating the meals, imagining it was all better fresh.

Photo 1 - Day 8 breakfast - eggs, a pork sausage patty, pancakes, a side of grapes, and apple juice. 8/10 I did love their pancakes, although the sausage patty was spicy and terrible for my stomach.

Photo 2 - Day 8 lunch - pepperoni pizza, French fries, and a zero calorie soda. 8/10 pizza here is so good and as much as I enjoyed eating it, I still can‚Äôt help but think they were trying to kill me.

Photo 3 - Day 8 dinner - chicken Alfredo over penne, a dinner roll, broccoli, a side salad, a chocolate brownie, and Gatorade and water to drink. 7/10 chicken was a little dry but the sauce was good and the brownie was excellent.

Photo 4 - Day 9 breakfast - turkey sausage links, eggs, and a small handful of breakfast potatoes, oatmeal, a side of fresh fruit, Ensure protein drink, milk, apple juice, and coffee. 4/10 I think they way overdid the drinks for this meal (moreso considering I couldn‚Äôt drink half of them). The sausage was the highlight of this meal, the potato portion was pathetic.

Photo 5 - Day 9 lunch - last meal before I was discharged. Grilled chicken sandwich, glazed carrots, tomato soup, fresh orange slices, potato chips, and water. 5/10 chicken was super dry, tomato soup wasn‚Äôt bad but it just wasn‚Äôt great cold.

Leading up to this recent string of sober days I was drinking nearly an entire 750mL bottle of whiskey a night, and rarely took more than a day off when I did manage to avoid drinking. In the past 2-3 years I've had maybe three or four stints where I managed to make it a week, maybe two, without drinking, but inevitably I'd hit a moment where I could justify a night of going back to my old habit and then start the counter over the next day, which of course I didn't do and instead continued on binge drinking every night.

This afternoon that switch in my brain went off and I decided I've been doing well and my head is in a better place than previous quitting attempts, and that I would have the ability to pick things back up tomorrow night. I got up from my desk, stuck the tote bag in my back pocket and headed out the door towards the local corner store. I took about five steps out my front door then something switched back and said, no, go get a coffee instead (something I can actually drink again now that I don't have a racy heart at all times from the booze). The coffee shop I went to happens to be right across the street from the store I've bought countless bottles over the past few years. Today I turned right to go into the cafe rather than left to go buy liquor.

1ojhstw,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ojhstw/upgrade_from_rancilio_silvia_2000/,Upgrade from Rancilio Silvia [2000‚Ç¨],"Hey, looking for some advice after spending time researching..

I'm in the EU, and have a Silvia that I've been using for about 13 years. I do one round of milk based coffee a day (usually two at a time, for me and my partner), and some espresso and americanos. I've got an option-o Lagom Casa as my grinder.

I'd like to:

* be less stressed when making 2 or more milk-based drinks (e.g. double boiler or thermoblock)
* not have to do temperature surfing
* perhaps play around with some more parameters and techniques
* have it be ready relatively fast (I'd like to stop using my Nespresso machine...). I turn it off in between shots, instead of keeping it on for 8 hours.
* keep it not substantially larger than the silvia, width wise (maybe 30-32cm max. Height and depth is less of an issue, but I do like small)

I considered installing a PID for a while, but I think I'm ready to upgrade the machine to something that will make my life a bit easier.

I've been looking at a few options: Lelit Elizabeth, Lelit Bianca, Ascaso Duo Plus and the Rancilio Silvia Pro X. 

The Ascaso interests me a lot on paper (startup time, functionality, size), but I'm worried about the quality issues and steam power. I like using double baskets (around 18-20g), and I'm also worried if it can keep the temperature stable enough through a pull. Maybe owners of recent machines can shine some light on wether they've been solving the quality issues, and if the steam power is ok (perhaps compared to the Silvia, if I'm lucky enough that anyone had both).

The Elizabeth and Bianca seems like decent machines, design wise I'm leaning towards the Elizabeth. I'm also not sure I'm a fan of the E61 on the Bianca, but it's got a lot of interesting parameters to fiddle with.

  
Sivlia Pro X is obviously an option. It's quite deep but I could fit it on the countertop. But I'm not sure what advantages it has over the smaller Elizabeth.

Any thoughts and experiences are more than welcome. And if there's any machines I've overlooked, I'll happily hear about them too.",2,1761774754.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I (19M) have known my girlfriend (19F) since we were 16. We were super close ‚Äî even lived together for a bit when we were 17. Then her parents duped her into moving out of state, we both visited for a holiday and they literally said last day to me that she‚Äôs not using her return ticket, and even though it hurt, I loved her, so we decided to make long distance work. I‚Äôd visit when I could, we talked every day ‚Äî I really thought we were solid and committed.

Last September, she told me she got kicked out of her parents‚Äô house and was going to stay with her friend ‚Äî let‚Äôs call them Cactus (not the real name, but trust me, it sounded fake as hell). I didn‚Äôt question it because I trusted her. I helped her through all of it ‚Äî sent money for food, gifts, clothes, and anything she needed.

She stayed with this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù from September until March, when she said she was moving into her own place. But right around the time she moved in with Cactus, she started getting distant. Out of worry, I looked up the address she gave me and found out the residents were all guys. It didn‚Äôt sit right, but I brushed it off because I didn‚Äôt want to be paranoid or controlling. And she said this cactus family was pretty big and the house was the ‚Äúfamily‚Äôs‚Äù 

By April, she stopped FaceTiming completely and said she just ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt check her phone much anymore.‚Äù Weird, but I kept believing her. I was even still sending her money for outings and ‚Äúmovie nights‚Äù with her friend. I genuinely thought I was helping her get through a tough time.

She stopped texting me goodnight 

Stopped texting me good morning

Stopped replying as quick, taking hours

Then in August, I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy her a coffee one day ‚Äî I was between paychecks ‚Äî and she suddenly told me not to text her anymore. No fight, no reason. Just‚Ä¶ done.

It‚Äôs now October. Two months of silence. Last night, I stumbled across engagement photos of her ‚Äî from March 2025. Meaning she was engaged the entire time we were still together. And she just got married last week. The photos were gut wrenching to see her with a complete different name. 

The worst part? The guy she married is one of the names I saw on that property list last October ‚Äî one of the dudes living at the place she called her ‚Äúfriend‚Äôs house.‚Äù

And honestly, the funniest (or maybe saddest) part of all this? I can‚Äôt trust if she ever used the money I sent her for what she said it was for. For all I know, I might‚Äôve literally paid for her engagement ring.

I feel like my entire reality just collapsed. I supported her emotionally and financially through everything, trusted her completely, and she was lying to me the whole time. It feels like the worst fever dream ever come true.

I feel like I built my dreams on this person for them to literally be a villain in my history

This post got [a lot of attention](https://www.instagram.com/esotouric/p/DQMkAIzjNhx/), with some commenters suggesting the artist must have made a mistake, because the senior housing project that was approved in 2020 is actually [next door at 625 Fair Oaks](https://southpasadenan.com/625-fair-oaks-project-approval-from-planning-commission/), where the brown office building is at the left of the rendering.

Part I ‚Äî The Prayer

He waited until the apartment went quiet. Not silent ‚Äî just quiet enough that he could hear the refrigerator humming like it had a pulse, like it was the only thing in the room still working. He sat on the edge of the bed, elbows on knees, hands hanging between them, staring at the floor. He hadn‚Äôt cried in months. Maybe years. It wasn‚Äôt that he didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äî he just didn‚Äôt remember how to start.
He looked up, half-smirking, like someone about to tell a joke that wouldn‚Äôt land.
 ‚ÄúOkay, God,‚Äù he said.
 No lightning. No warmth. Just the cheap ceiling light flickering like it was trying to look away.
He waited a minute, then another.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a miracle. Just... something.‚Äù
Something could‚Äôve been anything. A knock at the door. A phone buzz. A breeze. Anything that said, Hey, I heard you. But nothing came. Just that steady hum of machines that never got tired of living.
After a while, he nodded to himself, slow and heavy.
 ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought.‚Äù
He stood up, went to the kitchen, and poured himself a glass of water he didn‚Äôt want. The sink dripped. He stared at the droplets hitting the steel. Each one made the same dull note, like the second hand on a clock. You‚Äôre still here. You‚Äôre still here. You‚Äôre still here.
He remembered when he was a kid, praying for stupid things ‚Äî good grades, his mom to stop crying, a bike that didn‚Äôt squeak. Back then he thought silence meant not yet. Now he knew it just meant no one‚Äôs home.
He leaned against the counter and whispered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna do it, you know.‚Äù
 Then he smiled ‚Äî not out of bravery, but out of the kind of tired that doesn‚Äôt end with sleep.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even mad about it,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúYou had your chance.‚Äù
The hum of the fridge filled the pause again.
 A perfect mechanical mercy.
He drank the whole glass, set it down, and let his hands rest flat on the counter.
 In the reflection of the window, he didn‚Äôt see a man. Just a shape. A soft outline fading into night.
 It looked almost peaceful.
He stood there a long time, listening for something ‚Äî anything ‚Äî to change its mind.
But nothing did. 


Part II ‚Äî The Plan

He chose Thursday.

Not for any poetic reason ‚Äî just because it was a day no one cared about. Thursdays were in-between things. They didn‚Äôt belong to anyone. Monday had its dread, Friday had its release, Sunday had its ghosts. But Thursday‚Ä¶ Thursday just waited.

He liked that.

He didn‚Äôt circle it on a calendar or write it down. He just let it settle somewhere behind his eyes, the way you remember where you left your keys. A quiet decision. Not an act of rebellion, not a cry for help. Just logistics.

He‚Äôd do it after work, after he fed the cat. He figured that was fair. The cat didn‚Äôt deserve confusion ‚Äî just a full bowl and an open window. Maybe she‚Äôd leave. Maybe she‚Äôd stay. Either way, she‚Äôd have options. He liked the idea of leaving something with options.

At work, he found himself more efficient. It was easy to focus when the stakes were gone. His boss praised him for his ‚Äúrenewed attitude.‚Äù He smiled and said thanks. He started showing up early, staying late, cleaning things that didn‚Äôt need cleaning. People noticed. They said he seemed lighter. And he was ‚Äî he‚Äôd finally stopped pretending the future existed.

At lunch, he‚Äôd sit outside, smoking even though he‚Äôd quit years ago. The sky looked like it was trying to remember how to be blue. He thought about writing a note but didn‚Äôt know who it‚Äôd be for. He didn‚Äôt owe anyone an explanation ‚Äî they‚Äôd just turn it into a moral anyway. Everyone loves a neat story when they‚Äôre not the one in it.

He thought maybe he‚Äôd donate some clothes. Maybe delete his browser history. But even that felt performative. The truth was simple: he‚Äôd lived, he‚Äôd looked around, and it wasn‚Äôt what they said it would be.

Sometimes, while washing dishes or brushing his teeth, he‚Äôd think: I wonder what the last thought will be. Would it be regret? Relief? A memory? Or maybe nothing. Maybe it‚Äôd feel like blinking ‚Äî except this time, he just wouldn‚Äôt open his eyes again.

He stopped praying. Not out of bitterness ‚Äî he just didn‚Äôt see the point in talking to someone who clearly wasn‚Äôt picking up. Silence is only holy if you believe someone‚Äôs listening.

One night, while folding laundry, he looked at a shirt he hadn‚Äôt worn in years and realized he‚Äôd probably die with clean clothes in his drawer. That made him laugh. Out loud. Real laughter. The kind that comes from deep in the chest and tastes like dust.

He sat on the bed, folded the shirt carefully, and whispered,
‚ÄúThursday, then.‚Äù

And for the first time in a long while, he slept like someone who had everything figured out.

Part III ‚Äî The Girl

He met her on a Monday. Which was funny, in a grim sort of way ‚Äî he had three days left.

She worked at the caf√© he stopped in sometimes when he wanted to pretend he was part of the world. She had chipped black nail polish and a laugh that sounded like it wasn‚Äôt supposed to escape her mouth but did anyway. She asked his name when he ordered. He hesitated ‚Äî then gave his real one. He didn‚Äôt know why.

Maybe it was the way she looked at him ‚Äî not through him, not at him, just‚Ä¶ around him, like she saw the outline of something that used to matter.

She said, ‚ÄúYou look like someone who doesn‚Äôt talk much.‚Äù
He said, ‚ÄúI used to.‚Äù
She grinned. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù
He said, ‚ÄúI started listening.‚Äù

That made her laugh again ‚Äî the kind of laugh that belongs to someone who hasn‚Äôt figured out yet how cruel honesty can be. She gave him an extra shot of espresso ‚Äúon the house.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt argue. He just sat at the corner table, stirring his coffee like it was an alibi.

When he left, she told him to come back sometime.
He said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see.‚Äù
She said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what everyone says.‚Äù

That night, he moved Thursday to maybe next week. He didn‚Äôt call it hope ‚Äî just a delay. He told himself it was for research.

He started showing up more. Mondays, sometimes Wednesdays. He didn‚Äôt know what he wanted from her ‚Äî conversation, maybe, or distraction. She told him about her ex who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt get it.‚Äù About her roommate who kept stealing her lighters. About how she wanted to leave the city but couldn‚Äôt afford to. He didn‚Äôt say much. Just nodded, asked questions, made her laugh again.

Once, she asked what he did for fun.
He said, ‚ÄúI think about leaving.‚Äù
She said, ‚ÄúEveryone does.‚Äù

She wasn‚Äôt like him ‚Äî she still believed in mornings. But he liked the way she said things without realizing how broken they sounded. Like when she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù but her voice cracked just a little on the I.

He started wondering if maybe that‚Äôs what God sent instead of a sign ‚Äî not mercy, but a mirror. Someone just as lost, just better at pretending.

One night, she asked him if he wanted to hang out after her shift.
He froze. It should‚Äôve been easy to say yes. But something in him clenched, like a door slammed from the inside. He pictured himself sitting across from her, trying to look alive, pretending not to know he‚Äôd already left.

So he said, ‚ÄúMaybe another time.‚Äù
And she smiled like she believed him.

He walked home under streetlights that made everything look cleaner than it was. He thought about how close she‚Äôd come to saving him, or at least delaying him again. But he knew it wasn‚Äôt her fault. You can‚Äôt save someone who‚Äôs already written the ending ‚Äî only make them edit a few sentences.

When he got home, he found one of her black hairs stuck to his sleeve. It felt like evidence of something that almost happened. He left it there.

He went to bed early, and when he closed his eyes, he heard her laugh again ‚Äî faint, like it was coming from another room.

For a moment, he almost believed he could still get up and walk toward it.

Part IV ‚Äî The Friends

It started with one of those ‚Äúyou should come out with us‚Äù invitations that people don‚Äôt expect you to take seriously.
A guy from work ‚Äî Mark ‚Äî cornered him in the break room, all caffeine and false confidence. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing a little get-together tonight. Just beers, maybe cards. You should come.‚Äù

He almost said no out of habit. But then he thought: Why not?
He‚Äôd been delaying Thursday again, anyway. Maybe being around people would make it easier to go through with it. A sort of farewell tour.

The bar was one of those places where everything was sticky ‚Äî the floor, the glasses, the smiles. Mark brought two friends ‚Äî a couple who weren‚Äôt really a couple, if that makes sense. She kept touching his arm, and he kept pretending not to notice, and everyone around them played along because that‚Äôs how people do love now ‚Äî sideways, half-denied.

They introduced themselves. One of them, the girl ‚Äî Lana ‚Äî had a voice like smoke and teeth. She laughed like she didn‚Äôt owe the world anything. He liked that. She kept asking him questions that weren‚Äôt small talk. What do you regret? What‚Äôs your favorite failure?
He told her he didn‚Äôt know. She said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the right answer.‚Äù

The other guy ‚Äî Tom ‚Äî talked too loud, too sure of himself. Said things like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all broken, man, but at least we‚Äôre trying.‚Äù
He wanted to ask, Trying what? To look happy? To die slower?
But he just nodded, sipped his beer, and said, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

They started inviting him out more. He went sometimes. He became ‚Äúthe quiet one,‚Äù which everyone mistook for mystery instead of emptiness. They liked him more that way ‚Äî the man with gravity, the man who listened.

He found out later that Mark was sleeping with Lana. And so was Tom. And so, apparently, was a fourth person who never showed up. The whole group was a tangle of affection and betrayal that no one admitted to but everyone knew about. It was the kind of friendship that felt like it could collapse if anyone said anything real.

He didn‚Äôt blame them. People needed noise to drown out the loneliness. He just preferred the silence.

Once, Lana texted him late: Are you awake?
He stared at the screen for a long time before replying: Yeah.
Then nothing.
The little typing bubble appeared, disappeared, appeared again ‚Äî and then silence.

He laughed. Not cruelly, just‚Ä¶ knowingly. Everyone wanted to be seen, but no one wanted to see too much.

The next time they invited him out, he said he had plans. He didn‚Äôt. He just sat in his room, reading old messages, watching the phone not ring.

That night he thought about how easy it was to mistake proximity for connection. People bumping into each other in the dark, calling it friendship. He wondered if that‚Äôs all love ever was ‚Äî the right kind of confusion, briefly shared.

Before bed, he changed the date again. Not Thursday. Not yet.
Maybe after the next time.

But he knew there wouldn‚Äôt be a next time.

He could already feel the distance growing back ‚Äî the kind that doesn‚Äôt come from space, but from knowing too much about what‚Äôs underneath.

When he finally turned off the light, he whispered to no one in particular,
‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs just killing time. I‚Äôm just being honest about it.‚Äù

And he slept with that truth in his mouth, bitter and clean.

Part V ‚Äî The Opportunity

The email came on a Tuesday morning, subject line so bright and sterile it almost glowed:
‚ÄúCongratulations! You‚Äôve Been Selected.‚Äù

He stared at it for a long time before opening it. A scholarship. Full ride. Some continuing-education program he‚Äôd half-heartedly applied for months ago after seeing an ad. Transform your life, the tagline had said.

He laughed when he saw that part again. Not out loud this time ‚Äî just the kind of laugh that happens behind the ribs, half-air, half-ache.

He read the email twice, maybe three times. It was all there ‚Äî the schedule, the classes, the polite optimism that assumed he had dreams left to chase. He even caught himself imagining what it might look like: new clothes, new notebooks, new people who hadn‚Äôt already decided who he was.

Then he closed the laptop and went back to staring at the wall.

At work, Mark asked why he was smiling. He hadn‚Äôt realized he was. ‚ÄúGood news?‚Äù Mark said.
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúApparently, I‚Äôm going to be somebody.‚Äù

Mark clapped him on the back, said something about fate, about turning points. He nodded along, the way you nod when you know a song‚Äôs ending but everyone else is still dancing.

That night he sat at the kitchen table filling out the acceptance form. Halfway through, he stopped. The cursor blinked in the empty signature box like a heartbeat waiting to be claimed. He could almost feel the weight of every decision pressing down from the screen ‚Äî the future demanding to be believed in.

He closed the laptop again.

He walked to the window, looked out at the streetlights painting the cars below in fake gold. The city looked like it was trying too hard to mean something.

He whispered, ‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt want to be fixed?‚Äù

He thought about the girl ‚Äî how she‚Äôd probably clap and tell him he deserved it. How the friends would toast him, talk about ‚Äúfinally catching a break.‚Äù None of them would understand that sometimes the break you want is the one that ends everything.

He opened the fridge, stared at the light spilling out. The hum again ‚Äî steady, patient, alive. Everything around him just kept working. Machines don‚Äôt need meaning. They just do their job until they stop.

He envied that.

He poured himself a glass of water, let the tap run longer than necessary, just to hear something moving.

On the counter, the laptop‚Äôs screen dimmed, the congratulatory email fading into darkness.

He didn‚Äôt delete it. He just let it sit there ‚Äî like an unopened door he had no intention of walking through.

Before bed, he moved the plan back up. Not Thursday. Tomorrow.

This time he didn‚Äôt say it out loud. He didn‚Äôt need to.

The decision had become quiet, like gravity ‚Äî not pulling him down, just reminding him where he was.

Part VI ‚Äî The Mirror

He woke before the alarm, before the sun, before there was any sound in the world to tell him what hour it was. It didn‚Äôt matter. The body knows when it‚Äôs time.

He sat on the edge of the bed the same way he had that first night, elbows on knees, head down, waiting for a reason not to move. None came. Not anger. Not fear. Just stillness, clean and heavy like snow.

He showered. He shaved. He made the bed. He even opened the window to let in the kind of gray light that makes everything look like a memory. He wanted the room to be neat ‚Äî not as a statement, just as a courtesy.

While tying his shoes, he caught his reflection in the dark television screen. It startled him. Not because of what he saw, but because of how ordinary it was. Just a face. Eyes, mouth, the usual arrangement. You‚Äôd never know what he was carrying. You‚Äôd never guess.

He looked closer. The eyes didn‚Äôt plead, didn‚Äôt flinch. They just stared back ‚Äî patient, almost kind.

He whispered, ‚ÄúSo this is you.‚Äù

And for a moment, it felt like someone else was there ‚Äî not watching, exactly, but witnessing. The reflection didn‚Äôt move, but it understood. There was something unbearably honest about that glass ‚Äî it couldn‚Äôt lie, couldn‚Äôt comfort, couldn‚Äôt pretend. It just reflected what was.

He felt a tremor in his throat. Not sadness ‚Äî recognition.

This was what God‚Äôs silence meant, maybe. Not absence. Not cruelty. Just a mirror. A quiet showing of what had always been there.

He sat back down on the bed, hands in his lap, the hum of the fridge bleeding faintly through the walls. He thought about the girl‚Äôs laugh. The friends‚Äô noise. The scholarship‚Äôs promise. All of it flickered through him like stations he no longer had the will to tune in to.

He realized he didn‚Äôt hate any of it. He didn‚Äôt even hate himself. He just didn‚Äôt believe in the script anymore.

Outside, a car alarm went off. Somewhere, a dog barked. The city stretched and yawned into its morning. Everything continued.

He smiled ‚Äî not the kind that reaches the eyes, but the kind that says I get it now.

He walked to the bathroom and looked again at his reflection. Same eyes. Same quiet. Same ghost behind the skin.

He touched the mirror, and his fingers left a fog print that slowly faded.

It hit him then ‚Äî the absurd mercy of it all. That even here, in the middle of nothing, the world was still offering him this: to see himself, and to choose.

He didn‚Äôt know if that counted as salvation. Maybe it did. Maybe it didn‚Äôt. But it was something.

So he sat there a long time, listening to the world wake up, watching his reflection breathe.

And when he finally stood, he wasn‚Äôt sure anymore what day it was supposed to be.

He just knew the silence didn‚Äôt scare him anymore.

Because now, it sounded a little bit like peace.

Most people working at dispensaries don't expect tips and some job postings for those have said that tips add an extra $1-$4/hour on average.

We see this question come up a lot and honestly, it‚Äôs one of the biggest ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments when you start dialing in your brews.

When your coffee tastes sour, it‚Äôs usually not because of the beans themselves it‚Äôs about extraction.

Here‚Äôs the short version:
‚Ä¢Under-extracted coffee = sour, sharp, or lemony tang
‚Ä¢Over-extracted coffee = bitter, hollow, or dry aftertaste
‚Ä¢Balanced extraction = sweetness + clarity

Sourness usually means water didn‚Äôt pull out enough of the soluble compounds that round out flavor. The acids hit first, but the sweetness never shows up.

Here are a few simple tweaks that can help:
1.Grind a little finer. More surface area = better extraction.
2.Brew slightly longer. Give water more contact time.
3.Raise water temp a touch (195‚Äì205¬∞F is ideal). Cooler water = less extraction.
4.Check your ratio. Try 1:16 (1g coffee to 16g water) as a solid starting point.

Every variable affects flavor balance, but once you recognize the type of sourness, you‚Äôll start to know how to fix it instinctively.

üëâ Have you ever battled with sour coffee? What ended up fixing it for you. The grind, water, or brew time?

**Financial Performance**
- **Net Sales:** For the quarter ended September 27, 2025, net sales were $6.24 billion, down 2.3% from $6.38 billion in Q3 2024. For the nine months ended September 27, 2025, net sales were $18.59 billion, a 3.5% decrease from $19.27 billion in the prior year period.
- **Operating Income/Loss:** Q3 operating income was $1.03 billion, a sharp turnaround from a $101 million loss in Q3 2024. Year-to-date operating loss was $5.75 billion, compared to income of $1.72 billion in the prior year period, primarily due to substantial impairment charges.
- **Net Income/(Loss):** Net income in Q3 was $613 million (Q3 2024: net loss of $290 million). For the nine months, the company posted a net loss of $6.5 billion (2024: net income of $614 million).
- **Diluted EPS:** Q3 diluted EPS was $0.52 (Q3 2024: $(0.24)). Year-to-date diluted EPS is $(5.47) (2024: $0.50). Adjusted EPS, which excludes significant items like impairments and separation costs, was $0.61 for Q3 and $1.92 year-to-date, down 18.7% and 13.5% respectively.
- **Adjusted Operating Income:** Q3 adjusted operating income was $1.11 billion (down 16.9% YoY). Year-to-date adjusted operating income was $3.58 billion (down 9.9%).

**Key Drivers and Impairments**
- **Impairment Charges:** Significant non-cash impairment charges in 2025: $6.7 billion in goodwill and $2.6 billion in intangible assets ($9.3 billion total). Impairments reflect market risks, declining share price, and updated long-term growth assumptions.
- **Goodwill and Intangibles:** Goodwill declined to $22.17 billion from $28.67 billion at year-end 2024; indefinite-lived intangibles dropped to $34.12 billion from $36.46 billion.
- **Divestments:** Sale agreements entered for the Italy infant and specialty food business in Q3 2025.

**Segment Results**
- **North America:** Q3 sales $4.64 billion (down 3.8%); 9-month sales $13.89 billion (down 4.7%). Segment adjusted operating income down 17.8% in Q3 and 13.2% YTD.
- **International Developed Markets:** Q3 sales $895 million (up 1.6%), 9-month sales $2.61 billion (down 0.5%).
- **Emerging Markets:** Q3 sales up 3.8% to $701 million; 9-month sales up 0.9% to $2.09 billion. Segment adjusted operating income increased 19.6% YTD.

**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**
- **Cash & Cash Equivalents:** $2.11 billion at September 27, 2025 ($1.33 billion at year-end 2024).
- **Total Assets:** $81.7 billion (December 28, 2024: $88.3 billion).
- **Total Debt:** $21.2 billion long-term, up from $19.9 billion, reflecting new euro-denominated notes issued in Q1 2025 and scheduled repayments.
- **Shareholder Equity:** $41.6 billion, down from $49.3 billion at year-end 2024 due to large impairment charges and dividend payments.
- **Cash Flow from Operations:** $3.1 billion for nine months ended September 27, 2025 (2024: $2.8 billion).

**Dividends and Share Repurchase**
- **Dividends Paid:** $1.42 billion YTD ($0.40 per common share quarterly).
- **Share Repurchase:** $435 million YTD. $1.5 billion remains under the repurchase authorization.

**Risks and Uncertainties**
- **Separation Transaction:** Announced plan to spin off into two public companies. Expects substantial execution risk, potential disruptions, increased costs, employee attrition risks, and possible volatility in share price.
- **Impairment and Market Risk:** Brands with <5% fair value over carrying value are at heightened risk. The Kraft brand reported <2% margin, indicating sensitivity to further negative financial or market developments.
- **Commodity Inflation:** Higher costs in 2025, notably for coffee, meat, and eggs.
- **Legal and Regulatory:** Multiple ongoing legal, environmental, and tax-related proceedings, including IRS audits (2018‚Äì2022) and US DOJ environmental review.
- **Debt:** Large upcoming maturities ($1.9 billion in senior notes due June 2026). Ongoing exposure to interest rate and refinancing risk.

**Other Notable Items**
- **Restructuring:** Ongoing with $18 million expense YTD.
- **Capital Expenditures:** $596 million YTD, primarily in North America.
- **Debt Ratings:** Company intends to maintain investment grade status, but separation could risk downgrades and higher capital costs.
- **Tax Rate:** Effective tax rate for Q3 was 24% (2024: 2.5%). Year-to-date effective tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax loss was 2.4%.

**Outlook**
- **Near-Term:** Results will continue to reflect integration and separation expenses, restructuring activities, and ongoing legal and regulatory risks.
- **Long-Term:** The company's financial profile and risk parameters may materially shift post-separation.

**Investor Takeaway**
Kraft Heinz reported weak year-to-date results due to major impairment charges and softer top-line trends, though core operations generated strong cash flow. The pending separation represents a structural and strategic inflection point, bringing substantial execution and financial risks alongside potential future upside. Investors should closely monitor developments related to the separation, impairment risk, ongoing legal matters, and the company‚Äôs ability to navigate inflation and manage debt maturities.

Earlier that same day, I had surprised Annie by treating her to lunch as well as bringing her a coffee and dessert from her favorite cafe as a gesture to celebrate her recent accomplishments. After lunch, she invited me to join her later in the evening for dinner at the restaurant she had chosen. 

I am on an extremely tight budget as I recently purchased a home, and am dealing with some debt from unexpected medical expenses, but I agreed to go since she is my best and most loyal friend. 

Upon arriving at the restaurant, I sat down with Annie, her two sisters, and a few other of her closest friends. I took a look at the menu and decided I would just order a small appetizer, as it was what I could afford. Annie ordered a few cocktails, several appetizers, and a large main course. 

At the end of the meal, when the check arrived, Annie‚Äôs sister let her know she wouldn‚Äôt be paying for her own dinner because we were there to celebrate her big accomplishment, and everyone else seemed to agree. At first I thought Annie‚Äôs sister was planning to pay for the meal, until I realized she had meant that we would all be helping to split the cost of Annie‚Äôs meal. Annie was overwhelmed by the gesture, insisting that she at least cover the cost of her cocktails, but everyone kept insisting they pay for her until she finally agreed.

I waited until Annie went to the restroom before sharing with everyone else that I didn‚Äôt really have the money to be paying for anyone else‚Äôs food, especially since they are all wealthier than I am, and I had already bought Annie‚Äôs lunch. I said I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable being put on the spot and that I didn‚Äôt want to pay for anything besides my own dinner. Her friends and sisters laughed at first before realizing I was serious. When they realized I wasn‚Äôt joking, they all called me selfish, and said that I didn‚Äôt care about Annie‚Äôs big day. They said if I really cared about her then I would help cover the cost. I finally put my foot down and eventually  they agreed to split it amongst themselves, but I was so humiliated and holding back tears. When Annie returned from the bathroom, we all tried to act normal but the atmosphere has already changed.

All of Annie‚Äôs friends/sisters treating me differently now. Annie doesn‚Äôt know about the conflict since I didn‚Äôt want to ruin her big day, but I‚Äôm unsure if the situation is repairable between them and I, and I am much less likely to agree to join Annie for plans again if I know her other friends and sisters will be there.

Every day some new headline: ""Morgan Stanley opens new GCC,"" ""Goldman Sachs hiring 5000 in Bangalore."" And everyone is clapping, ""Waah! India's services story! Videshi investment! Kitna development!""

This is a naive take. Stop comparing this to the 90s.

Back then, we had Infy, TCS, Wipro. Woh¬†**hamari**¬†companies thi. Yes, they were body-shops, but they were¬†**Indian**¬†companies. They listed on the BSE/NSE. They built¬†*some*¬†capability. Indian shareholders actually made some wealth. We built¬†*our own*¬†giants.

Yeh GCC kya hai? It's just a digital sweatshop with better AC and free coffee. You are not an employee, you are a digital coolie. You are working for a foreign company, just sitting in India. You write some breakthrough code, you create a new algorithm, you invent some finance software. Mast kaam kiya. Who owns the IP? Not you. Not India. It‚Äôs owned by some ""Acme Corp, Delaware, USA"" or some other tax-haven.

You get your fat salary... yayy and boohoo... a 5 lakh car loan, and a ""Star Performer of the Quarter"" trophy. They get the multi-billion dollar intellectual property. FFS, you are just a highly-paid labourer building¬†*their*¬†generational wealth, not ours.

China ko dekho. They were the world's sweatshop for plastic toys. Ab? They are building world-class robotics, AI, drones. They are¬†*inventing*. They own the patents. They control the tech. Aur hum? We are proud to be the back-office for¬†*their*¬†companies. We have regressed.

This is literally the¬†**East India Company model, 2.0**. EIC took our raw cotton and sold us back expensive finished cloth. These GCCs are taking our raw brainpower, creating their IP for cheap, and then selling us back the same f\*cking software subscription at 100x the price.

And we are supposed to celebrate this? Ki humara talent ab¬†*officially*¬†videshi corporation ka hai? This isn't brain drain. This is brain¬†*looting*, and we are just the new digital colony. Shouldn't we start making this ""labour arbitrage"" a little harder for them? Maybe it‚Äôs time to talk about tariffs on these foreign corporations operating GCCs. Make them pay extra for siphoning off our best brains and their output. Or is that just ""protectionism"" and bad for ""free market""? What do you think?

We‚Äôre both divorced and right now we live with our parents to save money. I‚Äôm really grateful that I have my parents helping me out but moving in after being on my own for so long was a huge adjustment. Im no longer active in the religion and neither is my bf. 
For example, I drink coffee (and so does my grandma who lives with us- she‚Äôs Catholic) and my dad bought her favorite coffee but when I‚Äôd bring it into the house he told me ‚Äúit hurts my soul to have coffee in this house‚Äù. 
I told him I‚Äôd respect that, but tried to ask him what about my decisions is affecting his spiritual journey and after that discussion he relaxed about being around coffee and even bought me a few Starbucks gift cards for my birthday. Huge progress. 
The issue is my bf and I have been dating for more than two years. Not virgins anymore since we were both previously married but we are committed as life partners and are planning on moving in together in the next year. 
The problem I have is my dad is very against my bf sleeping over but I feel like it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm the oldest daughter? My cousin and her long term partner have slept in his home before and he didn‚Äôt make any issues of it. My sister and her partner did the same thing before they were married but for some reason he told me that my bf is only welcome between certain hours and he is not comfortable with him spending the night. I am respectful of his wishes but I really want to have a conversation with him about it but I‚Äôm not sure how to. I feel like this is a weird situation and standard that he‚Äôs holding me to when he doesn‚Äôt require it of others. Does he think he‚Äôs going to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù my sins or something? 
My bf is super sweet and is not one to cause any issues, I rarely invite him over just bc my dad has made some really uncomfortable comments to him which I feel infantilizes us both. 
My partner and I may not ever be married bc I‚Äôm not sure I want to go through that again, so even when I move out and come back to visit I‚Äôd feel like we could never stay with my parents. I love my parents but this has put a level of strain and weird moral control on my relationship that doesn‚Äôt need to be there. 
It‚Äôs also impacting the relationship my partner has with them bc neither of us enjoy being around religious control/coercion and it‚Äôs why we left. 
A conversation is for sure needed but I mustered up all my courage to talk about the coffee and this seems like a much more stressful situation. Am I overreacting, or should I just let it be? ",2,1761773447.0,AIO,6,0.75,False

Everything worked like a Swiss watch and the team was mostly quite happy, until our administrative assistant took a new job‚Ä¶

The new guy they hired, ‚ÄúCarl‚Äù was very odd to say the least. He spoke in a low gravely voice and had a deadpan type of humor. He whispered and would lean in close to talk. He was an older gentleman, who made some of the women in the office uncomfortable with his mannerisms. More on that later‚Ä¶

Carl was temperamental and cranky. He loudly scolded one of my teammates because he didn‚Äôt hold open the elevator door. He argued with his cube neighbor about how he‚Äôs allowed to eat hot, smelly food at his desk. He pounded on the copier and made the screen freeze when he allegedly was trying to fix a paper jam. 

He was supposed to set up for staff meetings and clean up the conference rooms. One of his worst performances was when he threw the leftover food (messy Chinese food) into the recycling bin in the lobby, and then put a half full coffee pot in the top rack of the CLEAN dishwasher. Are you kidding me?! The 
chicken and rice made our lobby smell like a cheap takeout bar and the coffee nearly clogged the dishwasher filter. 

He began falling asleep on the job. Turns out he was still messing around with ex-wife after hours. It was pretty shady and apparently he had to go pick her up from some sketchy nightclubs at 3 a.m. Who knows what kind of drug addicts and hookers he could have let into our workplace? Some parts of Toronto are not so flattering, and he frequented them. Like I say he was super odd and made everyone uncomfortable. Fortunately our security guard and door clerk were put on notice with his suspicious behavior. 

He lasted about 6 weeks. He got fired after he was a no-show/no-call twice. There was also rumors of him making some indelicate remarks about one of my female colleagues who was like 40 years younger than him, eww! The new AA who came in immediately after him was awesome.

But I won't lie the thoughts and anxieties are still intense about me eating 'too unhealthy' etc and this sent helped by the fact my stomach has been in bits today, so my ED is convincing me its because I am eating 'too processed' and that I need to eat more whole and healthy foods.

Gentle reader,

Tomorrow, Thursday October 30 at 9:30am, the City of Los Angeles will hold a planning hearing to discuss the future of a very special and vulnerable place: **Walker‚Äôs Cafe.**

[](https://www.yelp.com/biz/walkers-cafe-san-pedro)

If you love the idea of being able to patronize one of the oldest roadside restaurants in Southern California, and paying your respects to one of San Pedro native son and Chinatown screenwriter Robert Towne‚Äôs favorite places, ***please call in*** during the hearing ***or send an email today*** asking the Zoning Administrator to make some tweaks to City‚Äôs approvals for the proposed new development on the alley in order to ensure the cafe can reopen.

It‚Äôs simply good planning to balance the needs of the wider community along with the desires of Prospect Group, the investors who bought the building off-market for just $650,000 a few years back.

Below, you‚Äôll hear from preservation pal Damian Sullivan, a Walker‚Äôs Cafe fan (and the person who found the original Tail o‚Äô the Pup building in a storage facility, helped save the [Hollywood Arby‚Äôs sign](https://esotouric.substack.com/arbys) from the landfill and much more) who volunteered his time to identify potential operators for the landmarked restaurant but hit a brick wall with Prospect Group, who claimed they wanted to reopen the cafe, but whose actions suggest they‚Äôre really interested in building the biggest ocean view residence possible on the back of the parcel.

But it doesn‚Äôt have to be a choice between building new housing or supporting an operating historic cafe: there‚Äôs plenty of room for both, and if you tell the City that you care about Walker‚Äôs Cafe, that‚Äôs what can happen here.

Ever feel like you're running on a hamster wheel? You're *doing* all the things, but not really *feeling* the progress or the joy? I've been deep in that feeling, and I wanted to share a few small shifts that have made a huge difference for me.

**1. Tame Your Mornings with the ""Momentum Hour""** üöÄ

Instead of waking up and immediately drowning in emails or social media, I protect my first hour. It‚Äôs not about a crazy 5 AM routine, but about intention.

*   **First 20 mins:** No phone. Just hydrate, stretch, and sit with my thoughts.
*   **Next 20 mins:** Plan ONE major thing I need to accomplish today. Just one. This is my ""win"" for the day.
*   **Final 20 mins:** Start working on that one thing.

Getting a small win before the world's chaos hits you is a productivity and mood game-changer.

**2. Hunt for ""Joy Evidence""** üåü

This sounds a bit clinical, but it works. I started a simple note on my phone called ""Joy Evidence."" Throughout the day, I jot down tiny, specific things that made me feel good.

Not ""I'm grateful for my health,"" but stuff like:
*   The smell of coffee brewing this morning.
*   The way the sun hit the leaves on my walk.
*   That one funny meme my friend sent.

It actively trains your brain to notice the good that's *already there* instead of always chasing the next big thing.

**3. Address the ""Mental Static""** üß†

Let's be real: a lot of our stress isn't from our to-do list, it's from the non-stop chatter in our own minds. The replaying of awkward conversations, the worrying about the future, the inner critic that's always on duty... it's exhausting.

Learning to manage that internal noise is probably the single most powerful optimization you can make. It‚Äôs a process of understanding your emotional triggers and learning how to respond to them with intention instead of just reacting. It can be a lot to figure out alone. I personally found that having a guided plan made a huge difference in managing my emotional well-being; [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme) was incredibly helpful for me in that area.

It‚Äôs all a work in progress, of course. We're all just trying to make each day a little better than the last.

Everywhere I look, there‚Äôs a new rule. Feed every 2‚Äì3 hours or you‚Äôll ruin your supply. But don‚Äôt pump too soon or‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll also ruin your supply. But if you‚Äôre engorged, pump a little. Unless you have mastitis. Then don‚Äôt pump. But also don‚Äôt *not* pump.

I‚Äôm supposed to narrate my entire day so my baby can learn language early. So I‚Äôm walking around like a lunatic saying, ‚ÄúOkay, mommy is heating up her coffee for the *third* time today!‚Äù

And apparently, I should hold my baby all the time so they feel safe. but not *too* much, because they‚Äôll get spoiled. But if I don‚Äôt hold them, they‚Äôll have attachment issues.

Co-sleeping is dangerous.  
But letting them cry is traumatizing.  
So‚Ä¶ guess I‚Äôll just stand in the nursery holding them forever.

Oh, and temperature? Don‚Äôt even start. The baby‚Äôs too cold. Put socks on.

Oh no, they‚Äôre crying. its probably because of the socks.

They had him sat on a bench and bent forward while one of the older kids were grabbing the back of his neck or stretching his arms back or something that was genuinely causing this poor kid distress. As soon as I got to them it was all over and the kid got up and quickly left.

1ojgr3m,https://i.redd.it/1486funf94yf1.jpeg,Sour Shots [DeLonghi Dedica/Varia VS3],"Hello everyone,

For a few weeks now, I've been having a problem with my espressos becoming increasingly sour. With some shots, it even got a little better in between. However, for the past few days, I haven't been able to get a shot that tastes normal.
Now you can even see that something is wrong (see photo).
The extraction time (around 30 seconds) and brew ratio (approx. 1:2) are fine. I don't see any obvious channeling or similar problems with the extraction (but I don't have a bottomless portafilter). 

I have already thought about possible causes:
Beans:
The beans are fresh espresso beans 4 weeks after roasting. However, this also occurred with other beans. 

Grinder:
Varia VS3. Grind size is the same as for the shots when it was still good with the same type of beans. The grinder is cleaned thoroughly on a regular basis.
 The grinder makes an unusual noise at the end of grinding. (I will add a video). I have already contacted Varia, but have not yet received a response. Perhaps this is the cause of the problem.

Puck prep:
RDT, WDT, leveler, spring tamper (self-leveling). I don't think this is currently a problem. :D

Machine
DeLonghi Dedica
I tried descaling the machine, but that didn't help either. I tried several temperature settings. The only thing I noticed is that I used to not have a single drop of coffee during pre-infusion (more like after 7-8 seconds). Now it drips quite early. Perhaps that points to the problem?! However, the shot doesn't run any faster overall.
The puck also often breaks in the middle when knocked out and appears unevenly moist.

Milk (frothing):
I always use Oatly, so nothing has changed there either. I froth as usual.

Cup:
It is preheated before the shot.

Do you have any ideas about what else I could try? Please ask if you need more information.

Nepal mostly grows high-altitude Arabica (800‚Äì1,600m) in the Himalayan mid-hills. It‚Äôs grown in tiny family farms, usually shade-grown and basically organic by default because farmers don‚Äôt use heavy chemicals.

It tastes clean, bright, low bitterness, light-medium body with floral, fruity, chocolatey notes. It‚Äôs not that harsh punch-in-the-face roast; it‚Äôs more of a smooth specialty cup you can actually sip straight.

If you have friends or family traveling from Nepal, tell them to bring you a bag. The stuff you get locally there is fresh, cheaper, and often way better than what makes it to export shelves. Ask for beans from Gulmi, Palpa, Syangja, or Ilam if you want to flex. Thats it, i am going to dial this in now, just got it yesterday.",4,1761771920.0,espresso,3,0.83,False

The cashier would spin the tablet and the 15% 20% 25% would pop up. I'd tip 15% even though I disagreed with it. My friend who i'd meet for coffee stopped tipping then he came less and less saying if you don't tip they treat you like a leper. None of us meet up at cafes anymore for this reason. We'll meet at each others house. 

I was at a walk up burger stand over the summer. It's a pretty popular place and they do  good burgers and fries. What's always irked me is that when you order they literally ask you ""and how much would you like to tip?"".  The first time i said a buck. The last time I just said ""no thank you"".  Cashier clearly irked. It took me much longer to get my food. I stopped going. 

Was at a Dave's Hot Chicken. You order at the counter. They swing the tablet. I clicked no tip. When I got back into my car I noticed there were no dipping sauces that come free with the meal. Mistake or FU no tip guy? Could be either.

I've just got major tip fatigue and I'm done. 

I tip 20% at restaurants and bars. Always have. Tip the valet. This has always been a part of deal when going out and I was cool with it. I used to work in the restaurant/bar industry (low level- barback.)

I wonder how many others feel the same and if its enough that businesses notice. Or is the tipping culture just too beneficial to them because they don't have to raise employee wages.

We have had this babysitter for about 4 months. She watches my 1 and 3 year old for 8-10 hours/week. She‚Äôs a mom in my town and babysits part time while her older kids are in school. We live in a safe area but there are still weirdos- I was approached by a creepy man in a parking lot today with my toddler and there was a car jacking at the Walmart down the road. 

She watched them at my house for the first few weeks but then started taking them to the library and the local toddler gym. She stopped at her house on the way to the toddler gym one time to grab socks for herself, her house is on the way to the gym. I didn‚Äôt love that but didn‚Äôt make a big deal about it either which is maybe my fault.

I don‚Äôt think she was lying, I do wonder if she‚Äôs taken them anywhere else though. So I texted her a screenshot of it and said are you guys here? Bc I thought someone stole the diaper bag. She replied and said she stopped there to get prizes for my kids since they went through the coffee drive through near there anyway. That coffee shop is far from the library but it is the closest drive through and I go there too with my baby so we don‚Äôt have to get out of the car. So that‚Äôs fine, but her having my baby at the Dollar store when I thought they were 20 mins away at our local library freaked me out. 

When she got home she apologized a lot and I said it‚Äôs fine if she takes them out to a store but I need to know beforehand so I know where they are. In case something happens.

1ojgfpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/hingeapp/comments/1ojgfpu/how_to_handle_long_gaps_before_a_first_date/,How to handle long gaps before a first date without losing momentum?,"**Hi everyone, I posted this in the dating advice subreddit but figured it would be helpful here too since more Hinge related.**

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm a 30 yr old male with a good career and objectively have a lot of positive things going for me. I‚Äôve been using dating apps like Hinge, and I tend to get a handful of matches each month that I‚Äôm genuinely interested in. I‚Äôve found that my matches usually come from me commenting something flirty or witty on their prompts and that part seems to work well. Very rarely do I get matches just from liking a photo.

Where I struggle is when we actually get to the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs meet up‚Äù stage. Often, I‚Äôll hear something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy this entire week, but free the week after‚Äù.. which means there‚Äôs usually a 7‚Äì10 day gap before the first date. This hasn‚Äôt always happened with a girl I matched with but I‚Äôm finding it‚Äôs  becoming a more common occurrence the last few months.

In my experience, these long gaps tend to kill the momentum and vibe. Either we text too much and it starts to feel forced or stale, or we barely talk at all and the vibe fizzles out. This normally leads to the date getting  cancelled last minute or straight up being ghosted.

I‚Äôm not delusional thinking people don‚Äôt have busy weeks and/or the girl I matched with isn‚Äôt talking with 20 other guys at the same time, but this is more the reason why I want to go out sooner than later since I also do much better showing my true personality in person than over text. I just find it hard to believe someone who has high interest in a person and is actually in the city can‚Äôt squeeze 1hr their entire week to go out on even a simple coffee date. I personally work in a demanding profession with long hours and even I can still find time for someone I‚Äôm really interested in and not wait nearly 2 weeks. Which ultimately leads me to believe I‚Äôm much more interested in going out with them than they are. I‚Äôm curious how others handle this situation.. Do you keep the conversation going daily until the date? Do you check in every few days to keep it light and natural? Or do you just set the date and not worry if it fizzles out (assuming if it‚Äôs meant to happen, it‚Äôll happen)?

I‚Äôd appreciate any advice or perspectives from both guys and girls who‚Äôve dealt with this kind of momentum gap.

TL;DR: I often match with someone great on Hinge, but when we plan a date that‚Äôs over a week out, the momentum dies before we meet and I often just get flaked on or ghosted. How do you keep things feeling interesting and natural during that gap?",6,1761771529.0,hingeapp,12,1.0,False
1ojgf6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ojgf6e/looking_for_espresso_machine_and_grinder_advice/,Looking for espresso machine and grinder advice [‚Ç¨600],"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for some buying advice for a grinder and espresso machine with a total budget of around ‚Ç¨600.

I currently own a De‚ÄôLonghi espresso machine (~‚Ç¨80), but I get inconsistent shots even when using the same grind size and coffee, so I‚Äôm thinking about upgrading both the grinder and the machine.

Location

France (so shipping and warranty options are a bit limited here).

Preferred drinks

Espresso

Drink frequency

Usually 2 shots per day.

Experience level

Intermediate home user ‚Äî I‚Äôve been dialing in shots for a while and understand the basics of grind size, ratio, and puck prep.

Grinder options I‚Äôm considering

DF54 ‚Äì Seems great, but hard to find a reliable seller that ships to France. I‚Äôve also read about inconsistent build quality and poor after-sales service from some vendors.

Baratza Encore ESP ‚Äì More available locally, but I‚Äôm a bit worried about the plastic build and conical burrs (I‚Äôm not sure how much of a difference that makes for espresso quality).


Machine options I‚Äôm considering

Sage/Breville Bambino ‚Äì Seems like a solid entry-level option with quick heat-up time and decent performance for the price.


What I‚Äôm looking for

Consistent espresso shots

Compact footprint (limited counter space)

Reliable support or spare parts availability in France

Ideally an electric setup (no manual levers for now). 

Would you prioritize a better grinder (and keep my current De‚ÄôLonghi a bit longer) or go for a balanced grinder + machine setup within the ‚Ç¨600 budget?

Any reliable EU-based stores or bundles you‚Äôd recommend for this range?

It‚Äôs like watching a symphony through a telescope ‚Äî technically impressive, spiritually void.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on the lighting. Every track glows like someone cranked up the exposure because subtlety died in 2020. Monaco at dusk looks less like a race and more like a sponsored Instagram reel.


Handling: The Art of Making Cars Feel Like Shopping Carts

If there‚Äôs one aspect of F1 25 that deserves its own horror film, it‚Äôs the handling. ‚ÄúThey should have added features from the older games,‚Äù I whispered to myself after spinning for the 900th time exiting Turn 3. What was once a delicate ballet of throttle and brake has turned into a clumsy interpretive dance of lag, oversteer, and existential dread.

They say simulation evolves over time ‚Äî but in F1 25, it devolved into a physics engine that seems allergic to grip. Every corner feels like driving on a wet bar of soap. You either understeer into eternity or oversteer into a philosophical crisis. The cars have no weight, no nuance, and no sense of connection to the tarmac. It‚Äôs as if the developers thought ‚Äúrealism‚Äù meant ‚Äúmake everything worse.‚Äù

As I once said, ‚ÄúDriving in F1 25 isn‚Äôt about control ‚Äî it‚Äôs about surrender.‚Äù


Career Mode: The Endless Spreadsheet of Despair

Remember when Career Mode used to feel like a journey ‚Äî a story of progression, rivalry, and mechanical evolution? Yeah, me neither, because F1 25 made sure to erase every shred of charm. The ‚Äúcareer‚Äù in Career Mode now feels like doing your taxes in a race suit. Every menu is another corporate labyrinth, every dialogue another recycled soundbite from an NPC who looks like their soul was patched out in Update 1.03.

Customization? You get about three hairstyles, all designed to look like your driver just survived a hurricane. The ‚ÄúR&D Tree‚Äù ‚Äî that once-beloved relic of strategy ‚Äî now exists solely to give you the illusion of progress while you grind for points to fix a gearbox that was broken by bad RNG.

As the great philosopher once said (me, five minutes ago), ‚ÄúIn F1 25, your biggest rival isn‚Äôt Verstappen ‚Äî it‚Äôs motivation.‚Äù


AI and Racing Experience: The Dumb Get Dumber

The AI in F1 25 feels like it was programmed by interns who have never seen a racing line. They either ram you like you owe them money or back off so timidly it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre applying for a pacifist club. I swear one AI driver brake-checked me on a straight ‚Äî not because of a glitch, but because the game decided unpredictability equals personality.

Overtakes feel artificial, battles are scripted, and the infamous ‚Äúrubber banding‚Äù returns like a ghost from the early 2000s. You could drive a flawless race only to have the AI suddenly gain divine speed on the last lap. 

‚ÄúIn F1 25,‚Äù I mused bitterly, ‚Äúfair competition is just another DLC.‚Äù


Sound Design: The Symphony of Synthetic Screaming

The cars don‚Äôt sound like Formula 1 cars ‚Äî they sound like an orchestra of angry vacuum cleaners having an argument in a tin can. The engines lack depth, the crowd noises are nonexistent, and the pit radio could‚Äôve been voiced by someone half-asleep in a call center.
Remember when older F1 titles made your spine tingle with the roar of the V10s? That was passion. This? This is white noise wrapped in nostalgia theft.


Online Multiplayer: The Great Lag Festival

Playing online in F1 25 is like participating in a demolition derby disguised as esports. Players teleport, collisions register three seconds late, and the matchmaking is so broken it once paired me with someone who drove backward just to spell rude words in tire marks. The servers have the stability of a house of cards in a hurricane.

No penalties make sense. Contact warnings appear like pop-ups in a malware ad campaign. And when you finally quit in frustration, the game congratulates you for ‚Äúcompleting the session.‚Äù


Innovation: The Art of Rebranding Stagnation

Each year, Codemasters and EA promise innovation. And each year, they deliver d√©j√† vu. They could have revived the legendary ‚Äúclassic cars‚Äù mode. They could have brought back proper team management depth. They could have ‚Äî dare I dream ‚Äî improved pit strategies. But no, instead, we get new menu transitions, a slightly different font, and a ‚Äúrevamped‚Äù handling model that feels like punishment.

As I wrote in my (unpublished) manifesto, ‚ÄúThe tragedy of F1 25 is not that it‚Äôs broken, but that it‚Äôs proudly predictable.‚Äù


Conclusion: A Monument to Missed Potential

Recommending F1 25 is like recommending someone drink lukewarm instant coffee while telling them it‚Äôs gourmet espresso. It‚Äôs not just false ‚Äî it‚Äôs cruel. The game is a monument to how corporate comfort and fan apathy can bury creativity under a pile of patch notes and press releases.

Older games had spirit. They had heart. F1 25 has microtransactions, motion blur, and the hollow echo of potential lost to time.

So no, I will not recommend F1 25. I will, however, recommend that you play literally anything else. Read a book. Touch grass. Drive a real car into a wall at low speed ‚Äî you‚Äôll get a more authentic F1 experience that way.

Because in the end, ‚ÄúF1 25 doesn‚Äôt simulate racing ‚Äî it simulates regret.‚Äù",0,1761771373.0,F1Game,14,0.14,False

1ojgc3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ojgc3m/second_attempt_with_more_accountability/,Second attempt - with more accountability,"Hey folks,

I am planning to go 60 days without drinking coffee (ok, maybe just 53 - but more on that later).  
This is the second time I am trying to quit coffee. The first time was around mid 2020.   
For some context: I am a software developer and used to work at an agency where the kitchen was kind of the center of the office. The big downside: we had a very nice portafilter machine with a very good coffee grinder.

This lead to days where I had 1-2 cappuccinos and 2-3 double shots of espresso. I think we do not have to argue about that this definitely affected my sleep.   
And I had periods where I was in a really bad cycle of having stress at work and in my private life, drinking lots of coffee, bad sleep, feeling exhausted the next day and the loop continued.  
At some point it was just too much and I quite coffee cold turkey for around 30 days. The first days where just brutal and I had to call in sick at work - the headaches where just too severe. I could just lay in bed and do nothing.  
After around day six or seven I finally started to feel better and the deep slumber I got at night was just incredible. Those days where the first since forever where I was just falling asleep. Something I always had trouble with (or just since drinking coffee?).  
And I was finally dreaming again. Something that did not happen in the years before that as well. 

And then? After Covid was not as big of an issue I went back to the office. And it all went down from there -> ‚ÄûJust one coffee in the morning‚Äú  
Of course... the afternoon crash came and with it the the second coffee and so on.   
Plus the social aspect of coffee always dragged me back, since everything was planned/talked/argued about while having a coffee.

Here I am again, having bad sleep, feeling exhausted in the morning, feeling sore, etc. After binging YouTube videos of people quitting coffee I decided it is time for me to give it a second try. 

Since I am self-employed I am going to take the easier route to first reduce my consumption to one cup a day for a week and then quit altogether.

To put a bit more accountability behind my second try I created this ‚Äûquitting caffeine tracker‚Äú: [https://quitting-caffeine.com/challenges/d38ecb6b-dbcc-4b70-a1be-f15c9a3f0257](https://quitting-caffeine.com/challenges/d38ecb6b-dbcc-4b70-a1be-f15c9a3f0257)

As my personal journal and for others to follow along. I am starting today. Feel free to watch me suffer üòÑ

\--------------------

It was all over the news‚Äîevery station, local and national‚Äîbut that didn‚Äôt make it real.¬† They‚Äôd seen too many found-footage movies over the years, DVD extras and featurettes, and no amount of real life horror could make it feel like anything other than an elaborate creative exercise.

They ate dinner side-by-side on fold-out trays, while the television jumped between desk anchors, field reporters with a finger to their ear, and snippets of cell phone and dashcam videos submitted by viewers.

But there were still commercial breaks and sports tickers.¬† Still appeals to buy cell phones, and cheeseburgers, and last year‚Äôs cars, before they were all gone.

Miguel said, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt seem real.‚Äù

And it still didn‚Äôt.

Then Pearl Nextdoor‚Äîshe had a real name, but for the past three years that‚Äôs all they‚Äôd ever called her‚Äîknocked on the apartment door, frenzied and afraid.

‚ÄúSamira?¬† Miguel?¬† It‚Äôs Pearl.¬† Pearl next door?‚Äù Her voice, muffled through the old wood.¬† Then softer, murmuring. ‚ÄúOh, God, please be home‚Ä¶‚Äù

Miguel moved his tray out of the way and went to answer.¬† Didn‚Äôt unhook the chain, but gapped the door enough to size up the little old woman in the hall outside.¬† Short, pear-shaped, wrapped in a brightly-patterned caftan.¬† They stared at each other through the gap.

‚ÄúOh, Miguel, thank God.¬† I‚Äôm sorry. You must be in the middle of dinner.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no trouble.¬† Is everything alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was hoping‚Ä¶‚Äù She sighed, embarrassed. Looked back down the hall, then again at him.¬† Her hands clenched and unclenched the too-bright cotton.

‚ÄúI feel so stupid, but.¬† I don‚Äôt have a TV.¬† Do you know what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

Samira heard the door close softly. The chain rack and swing loose.¬† A soft shuffle of bodies in the apartment‚Äôs crowded foyer.

Miguel returned with Pearl at his heels, his eyes lurking up from beneath the shelf of his brow.¬† His hands turned outward helplessly.¬† *What could I do?*

‚ÄúOh, Samira.‚Äù¬† Pearl shuffled to her swiftly, and the women embraced.¬† Samira moved her own tray out of the way, no matter Pearl‚Äôs objections, and made a space for her on the couch between them.¬† Miguel cleared their plates as they sat together, Samira caressing her hands as they watched the TV.¬† She reached for the remote and thumbed up the volume.

The evening anchor cycled through the same headlines, adding in a few more details, filling in gaps.¬† They cut to a local map.¬† Regional.¬† National.¬† A time-lapse of hours blotched red across the tri-state area like an unchecked infection.¬† It stretched inland from the coast, joining areas together in grotesque swathes.¬† Miguel rejoined them, beer bottle trembling in one hand.

Pearl said, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt seem real.‚Äù

The screen went suddenly, vibrantly blue.¬† They sat back as one, bathed in it, breaths held.¬† Then another screen, this one banded vertically in yellow, blue green, pink, red.¬† In crude digital font, the words *PLEASE STAND BY AND STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THIS STATION.*

A short, flat, blaring alarm from the television speakers.¬† Silence.¬† Another short, flat, blaring alarm.

Samira reminded herself to breathe.

Now it felt real.

They waited an hour for something else to happen.¬† *Anything*.¬† Every ten minutes the screeching alarm would sound again, followed by an eerie, digitized reminder to stay tuned, and another alarm.¬† Samira made coffee, but no one drank it.¬† Miguel stood and paced restlessly.

‚ÄúWhen are they gonna *say* something?‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess they‚Äôre still‚Ä¶ switching over.¬† They hand things over to the national news, don‚Äôt they?‚Äù

But every channel was the same.¬† With each screeching alarm they twitched in their skins.

‚ÄúFuck this,‚Äù Miguel said at last.¬† ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm turning in.¬† I gotta be up early for work‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúFor work?‚Äù¬† Samira gestured to the screen.¬† ‚ÄúBaby, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs gonna be *work* tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, the world doesn‚Äôt just *stop*, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes this look *normal* to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI should go.‚Äù¬† Pearl stood, gathering and smoothing the patterned cotton in turns.¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs getting late, who knows when they‚Äôll come back. Or If it will even be tonight.‚Äù

Samira walked her to the door, a hand at her frail back.

‚ÄúIf anything changes, if they say anything‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got my radio. I‚Äôll put that on, for a while. I doubt I‚Äôll be able to sleep.‚Äù

The TV screeched behind them, and they twitched.¬† Pearl fumbled for Samira‚Äôs hands and squeezed them.

‚ÄúThank you for letting me come over.¬† It‚Äôs funny, isn‚Äôt it? I used to tell everyone that I didn‚Äôt have a television. I was proud about it.¬† You don‚Äôt realize how cut off you are until something like this happens.¬† How alone we all are.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre right next door if you need anything,‚Äù she promised.

The door closed, the chain clicked and rattled shut.¬† Miguel stood with both fists cocked, but there was no one to fight.

‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúWe ought to just go to bed.¬† *I‚Äôm* going to bed.¬† I got to be up early‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMiguel‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äú--and the roads are going to be impossible tomorrow.¬† Every idiot and his brother is going to be trying to get into or out of town.‚Äù

Samira‚Äôs head turned, her face banded with color in the backwash of light.

*Please stand by.*¬† So absurdly polite.

She searched for the remote, shunting it back into darkness and silence.

‚ÄúAlright. I‚Äôll come with you.‚Äù",1,1761771255.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

1ojgbf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ojgbf0/how_to_handle_long_gaps_before_a_first_date/,How to handle long gaps before a first date without losing momentum?,"Hey all,

I‚Äôm a 30 yr old male with a good career and objectively have a lot of positive things going for me. I‚Äôve been using dating apps like Hinge, and I tend to get a handful of matches each month that I‚Äôm genuinely interested in. I‚Äôve found that my matches usually come from me commenting something flirty or witty on their prompts and that part seems to work well. Very rarely do I get matches just from liking a photo. 

Where I struggle is when we actually get to the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs meet up‚Äù stage. Often, I‚Äôll hear something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy this entire week, but free the week after‚Äù.. which means there‚Äôs usually a 7‚Äì10 day gap before the first date. This hasn‚Äôt always happened with a girl I matched with but I‚Äôm finding it‚Äôs  becoming a more common occurrence the last few months. 

In my experience, these long gaps tend to kill the momentum and vibe. Either we text too much and it starts to feel forced or stale, or we barely talk at all and the vibe fizzles out. This normally leads to the date getting  cancelled last minute or straight up being ghosted. 

I‚Äôm not delusional thinking people don‚Äôt have busy weeks and/or the girl I matched with isn‚Äôt talking with 20 other guys at the same time, but this is more the reason why I want to go out sooner than later since I also do much better showing my true personality in person than over text. I just find it hard to believe someone who has high interest in a person and is actually in the city can‚Äôt squeeze 1hr their entire week to go out on even a simple coffee date. I personally work in a demanding profession with long hours and even I can still find time for someone I‚Äôm really interested in and not wait nearly 2 weeks. Which ultimately leads me to believe I‚Äôm much more interested in going out with them than they are. I‚Äôm curious how others handle this situation.. Do you keep the conversation going daily until the date? Do you check in every few days to keep it light and natural? Or do you just set the date and not worry if it fizzles out (assuming if it‚Äôs meant to happen, it‚Äôll happen)? 

I‚Äôd appreciate any advice or perspectives from both guys and girls who‚Äôve dealt with this kind of momentum gap.

TL;DR:
I often match with someone great on Hinge, but when we plan a date that‚Äôs over a week out, the momentum dies before we meet and I often just get flaked on or ghosted. How do you keep things feeling interesting and natural during that gap?",4,1761771249.0,dating_advice,12,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Chicago Bulls vs. Sacramento Kings: A Tale of Tired Bunnies and Porcupine Defense**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

The Chicago Bulls, fresh off a 3-0 start that‚Äôs making their 2021-22 run look like a dampened memory, are set to host the Sacramento Kings on October 29, 2025. Let‚Äôs parse this matchup with the precision of a tax auditor and the wit of a late-night host who‚Äôs had one too many espressos.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Bulls‚Äô Porcupine Defense vs. Kings‚Äô Sleep-Deprived Offense

The Bulls are a statistical marvel this season: **2nd in defensive rating**, **6 players averaging double-digit scoring**, and a **3-0 ATS** run that‚Äôs making bookmakers weep into their coffee. Their defense is so stifling, it‚Äôs like trying to dunk through a spiderweb‚Äîpossible, but why? Zach LaVine, their offensive engine, is scoring **29 PPG on 51.9% shooting**, and he‚Äôs already cleared the 22.5-point prop in 4/4 games. Meanwhile, the Kings are a tired, punchless squad: **25th in offensive rating**, **1-3 with all losses by 6 points or fewer**, and playing the **second night of a back-to-back**. Their ‚Äúenergy‚Äù is about as high as a sloth on a caffeine IV.

Key stat: The Kings are **6th worst in clutch performance** (last 4 minutes, +/- 5 points), and their coach, Doug Christie, has taken personal responsibility for their inability to close games. Spoiler: He‚Äôs not closing this one.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Ex-Players, and a Dash of Absurdity

The Bulls are without **Coby White** (out for the season after tripping over his own shoelaces during a layup drill‚Äîyes, really) and **Zach Collins**, but their depth has been tested and graded an A+. The Kings? They‚Äôre missing‚Ä¶ well, no one notable, but their **offense is a slow cooker that forgot to turn on**. Sacramento‚Äôs 25th-ranked attack is so anemic, even DeMar DeRozan (their former Bulls teammate) might side-eye their half-court sets.

Ah, yes‚ÄîDeRozan and LaVine, the ‚Äúexes‚Äù of the NBA, now suiting up for Sacramento. Let‚Äôs not expect a tearful reunion. DeRozan‚Äôs 19-point games this season are about as impactful as a screensaver. LaVine, meanwhile, is sco

But in the past three years, he‚Äôd seen us take the miracle berry to new heights, turning what used to be a $7-per-berry novelty into something that could be enjoyed for about a dollar or less per serving. He recognized we were making the berry not just more affordable but more approachable and practical for everyday life. That was exactly the kind of innovation this market needed.

So there we were, having dinner in Santa Monica, and he introduced us to something new: a miracle berry concentrated melt. This was a form that dissolved on your tongue in about 10seconds, kind of like cotton candy. It was a neat idea because it saved you from chewing, but it also came with a catch: a higher price point that didn‚Äôt really fit our mission of keeping the berry affordable.

We knew we had to stay true to what we set out to do: make the miracle berry a daily delight. Heck, even after dropping the price as much as we had, for some it was already a luxury splurge. So while we loved the innovation, we decided to keep focusing on the form that everyone could enjoy without breaking the bank. But I‚Äôd be lying if I said it wasn‚Äôt tempting to be a part of the newest of the new. More on that to come.

Now onto the taste test. This week, I headed down to¬†[Intelligentsia Coffee Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/15208805/admin/page-posts/published/?share=true#)¬†with a friend who was visiting and eager to try their new oat milk latte. I‚Äôd never been so I didn‚Äôt understand the hype or the line out the door. But Abbot Kinney isn‚Äôt a place to knock until you try so I was game to wait with my mate.

Finally the latte arrived and we dove in headfirst. It had a little sweetness but also that familiar bitter kick of coffee. Frankly, the oat milk wasn‚Äôt as delicious as I‚Äôd hoped. But that worked out because I had a plan for that.

Up next came¬†[Nature‚Äôs Wild Berry](https://www.natureswildberry.com/). I let it do its 30-second magic and took another sip. Holy moly, that latte turned into the most delicious coffee I‚Äôd ever tasted. It was like all the bitterness vanished and left behind a perfectly balanced sweetness.

That‚Äôs good to hear- I‚Äôm doing well, thank you. Not that busy here, is it? I guess everyone is out partying‚Ä¶ *(jokingly)* You‚Äôre the lucky one that gets to work, are you?

You don‚Äôt mind it?¬†

(...)¬†

Ah, you planned well. Bringing a book *is* a good idea. I brought one myself.¬† I was kind of hoping this place would be empty, actually. My roommate is throwing a party himself, I wanted a quieter place to read.

(...)¬†

Would I be able to get a‚Ä¶ Small black coffee, please?¬†

I know it‚Äôs late for coffee- but I‚Äôm hoping to finish the book tonight. I only have 278 pages left.¬†

Obviously me and my husband are shocked and we profusely apologized and took him home. We sat him down and explained to him what the word means and why we don‚Äôt say it. He told us that uncle Trey said it‚Äôs ok because we are mexican (we are spanish but my husband is white and our kids look WHITE). I told him that it doesn‚Äôt matter what we look like that we can‚Äôt go around saying a negative racist derogatory word. 

He just keeps saying that it doesn‚Äôt make sense cause he hears songs on the radio and on tv and uncle Trey and his friends say it all the time and tell him that it‚Äôs ok if he says it! 

I called my sister and Trey but they both just laughed and said that it was funny and not a big deal. I told them that they know he doesn‚Äôt look Mexican and that people will think he is racist and he could get beat up! He doesn‚Äôt understand social cues already and encouraging that kind of behavior is never ok! They eventually apologized but Trey said he can say and do whatever he wants (ok that‚Äôs true I‚Äôll give him that I‚Äôm not the one married to him). But I said they are no longer allowed around my kids and now I‚Äôm being called dramatic. 

I‚Äôm so embarrassed. I‚Äôm confused. I don‚Äôt want my son to get hurt because he doesn‚Äôt understand that he can‚Äôt say that word ESPECIALLY at a Christian school!

Friday, September 1, 2006, 9:00 AM



It was a Friday morning at Mondo A-Go Go. In the woods surrounding the park, two women were playing paintball. They ran through the woods, but stopped as they heard creepy howling. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move a muscle‚Äù, one of the female paintballers said. ‚ÄúTrust me, I won‚Äôt‚Äù, the other one replied frantically. It seemed that something big was about to ambush them from the bushes. They screamed as whatever it was jumped out at them. This was no animal, this was their friend, Tommy. Tommy shot them with paintballs even though they had taken off their helmets. ‚ÄúGotcha!‚Äù, Tommy yelled. He headed off laughing, but the girls were not having it. ‚ÄúOuch, that hurt!‚Äù, the first paintballer girl said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a loser, Tommy!‚Äù, the other one yelled.



9:05 AM



‚ÄúGirls are no fun‚Äù, he commented to himself. Tommy headed deeper into the woods. Unbeknownst to him, a dangerous creature was stalking him for real. Tommy heard this animal behind him and thought it was the girls. He looked into the ferns but didn‚Äôt find them. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt scare me!‚Äù, he taunted. However, little did he know that the creature had caught up to him, and was behind him about to pounce. The creature growled, charged, and attacked Tommy. Tommy is swept off his feet as the creature mauled him. His screams echoed through the woods surrounding Mondo A-Go Go.

The Creek-Side Cafe



9:10 AM



Sarah was at the Creek-Side Cafe, a nice cafe located near the Creek. She was waiting to meet Double D for a coffee. Double D and Marie arrived in their car. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be just a minute‚Äù, Double D told Marie. ‚ÄúOk‚Äù, Marie said reluctantly. He got out of the car to talk to Sarah. ‚ÄúHey, Sarah!‚Äù, he greeted her. ‚ÄúHey, Double D‚Äù, she greeted him. ‚ÄúI bought you a coffee‚Äù, she told him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great, Sarah, but unfortunately, I can‚Äôt stay. It‚Äôs work again. Gotta do a presentation about zoology. Boring!‚Äù, Double D told Sarah. ‚ÄúThat sucks‚Äù, Sarah said. Double D burnt his mouth by drinking the coffee so fast. ‚ÄúOuch!‚Äù, he yelled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not your fault‚Äù, he apologized. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll text you‚Äù, Sarah said. ‚ÄúOk, thanks for the coffee‚Äù, Double D said.



9:12 AM



Double D got in the car with Marie. ‚ÄúDouble D. What‚Äôs gotten into you? You‚Äôre interested in animals. You‚Äôre a fricking paleontologist!‚Äù, Marie scolded. ‚Äù Yes, I love animals and am super interested in them. It‚Äôs for Sarah. She‚Äôs probably not gonna wanna hang out with a nerdy dude‚Äù, Double D explained as the they drove off. After the two drove off and left the Creek-Side Cafe, Sarah looked at a picture of Rex on her phone and sended it to an unknown device. ‚ÄúSENDING. YOUR IMAGE HAS BEEN SENT. LOCATION SENT:THE PEACH CREEK ARC‚Äù, the computerized digital voice on the phone told her.



Peach Creek ARC



9:35 AM



Everyone was waiting in the Peach Creek ARC‚Äôs operation room for Double D‚Äôs reveal of a device built by himself, with the help of Eddy‚Äôs brother. ‚ÄúSo, you have a boyfriend?‚Äù, Ed asked April. ‚ÄúErm, no, he‚Äôs actually my fiance‚Äù, April corrected. Double D and Marie arrived. Double D booted up the device, which was a set of flat-screen television screens mounted up on a skeletal metal framework. He turned it on and it displayed a map of Peach Creek and the surrounding area. ‚ÄúThis, guys, is the Anomaly Detection Device, or the ADD for short‚Äù, Double D explained. ‚ÄúIt monitors the whole of Peach Creek and the surrounding area‚Äôs transmissions for the anomalies‚Äô telltale interference patterns, along with a prototype handheld version for use in the field‚Äù, Double D explained. ‚ÄúIn theory, the ADD will alert us within seconds of the appearance of a new anomaly‚Äù, he continued.



9:38 AM



As Double D told the team about the ADD, Eddy‚Äôs brother just got off the phone. ‚ÄúAre you sure this thing works?‚Äù, Eddy‚Äôs brother asked. ‚ÄúYeah, why?‚Äù, Double D asked. ‚ÄúI just got a call that could be evidence of a new creature attack at Mondo A- Go Go. The ADD did not pick up any anomaly‚Äù, Eddy‚Äôs brother replied.



Mondo A-Go Go



12:40 PM



The team arrived in their truck in the woods that surrounded Mondo A-Go Go. They found Tommy‚Äôs corpse being taken away by an ambulance. Ed went over to investigate it. ‚ÄúThis is gruesome, but it could of just been a big cat that went rogue , and escaped from a zoo‚Äù, Ed said. Ed and April went over to meet the deputy park manager and park ranger, Ranger Rita. ‚ÄúHi, who are you?‚Äù, Ed asked. ‚ÄúMy name is Ranger Rita. I‚Äôm deputy park manager here at Mondo A- Go Go‚Äù, Ranger Rita introduced herself. ‚ÄúRanger Rita. I want this situation kept secret so it doesn‚Äôt chaos among the public‚Äù, April said. ‚ÄúWe need to raise awareness about this sort of thing. People being killed by creatures so more people don‚Äôt die!‚Äù, Ranger Rita cried.



12:50 PM



The team walked into the park and met Ranger Rita‚Äôs boss, Petey Piper. ‚ÄúPetey, we need to evacuate Mondo A- Go Go because a big cat that escaped from a zoo just killed a man in the woods! If we don‚Äôt take action, more people, including families could die!‚Äù, Ed told him. ‚ÄúNo! It‚Äôs peak season for the park right now. Do you understand how financially crippling that would be for the park?‚Äù, he replied. ‚ÄúI agree with him, Ed. Plus, it would draw too much attention from the press‚Äù, April said. ‚ÄúOk, how about we compromise? How about I close the paintballing area in the woods and keep the rest of Mondo A-Go Go‚Äù, Petey said. ‚ÄúOk, that‚Äôll work‚Äù, Ed said. ‚ÄúHowever, I will not hesitate to sue you if you mention big cats again!‚Äù, Petey threatened. Petey then headed over to a smiling family whom he told, ‚ÄúMondo Mondo!‚Äù, he said.



12:55 PM



‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried about the risk of park visitors dying!‚Äù, Ed argued. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried about the media‚Äôs reaction!‚Äù, April argued. ‚ÄúThe noise might keep the predator away‚Äù, Ed said. Meanwhile, in a picnic area, and playground, in the woods surrounding the park as they spoke, a mom, and her children were arguing over a dispute. Her other child, who was a toddler, heard noises coming from the bushes, and saw a pair of glowing blue eyes. ‚ÄúArgh! Mommy help! There‚Äôs a monster in the bushes!‚Äù, the little boy yelled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, there‚Äôs no monster!‚Äù, his mother told him as she looked where he was and saw nothing. He ran back to his mother and they left the picnic and playground area. The predator was still there in the bushes and just watched silently.



1:00 PM



‚ÄúOk, Double D. I want you to look after the park visitors‚Äù, Ed told him. ‚ÄúAlright, sir!‚Äù, Double D said. ‚ÄúMe, Eddy, and Marie are going into the woods to search for the predator‚Äù, Ed told him before leaving. Double D got a text from Sarah. He replied, but suddenly saw what he thought was the creature. He shot his tranquilizer gun at it, but it turned out to be the manager dressed up as the lion mascot of Mondo-A Go Go. ‚ÄúYou shot me!‚Äù, he yelled at Double D furiously.



Easton Farm



1:10 PM



Meanwhile, April, and Ed investigated a nearby farm. They met the owner of it, a farmer by the name of East Easton. ‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm Ed‚Äù, Ed said. ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm East Easton. I own this farm‚Äù, Easton said. ‚ÄúSo, have you heard the news about a big cat attacking people at Mondo- A Go Go?‚Äù, Ed asked. ‚ÄúErm, no. Although, I do have a history of importing exotic animals into the country including big cats like lions, and tigers‚Äù, Easton claimed. ‚ÄúErm, illegally?‚Äù, April asked. ‚ÄúLaws vague‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs illegal, Easton‚Äù, April said. ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù, Easton apologized. ‚ÄúThese dogs aren‚Äôt illegal, though‚Äù, Easton said. Easton showed them two German shepherds he had as pets on a leash. ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù, Ed said before April took him to the side to talk to him. ‚ÄúLeave the public sector to me next time‚Äù, April told him.



1:15 PM



Double D arrived at the farm with Marie and Eddy who were in the park itself. ‚ÄúAny sightings of the creature?‚Äù, Ed asked. ‚ÄúNope!‚Äù, Double D said. ‚ÄúAlright, guys. You need to go into the woods and find it‚Äù, Ed told the three. Eddy, Double D, and Marie then left to find the creature in the woods.



8:00 PM



Night had fallen in the woods. The sounds of owls and crickets could be heard. The team searched the nearby woods for any sign of the animal. They used infrared night-vision goggles to counter the creature‚Äôs likely nocturnal abilities. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting hot in here, Marie‚Äù, Double D joked as he looked at Marie the the goggles on. While walking around, Eddy found Ranger Rita lost in the woods. ‚ÄúHey, Rita, I‚Äôm Eddy. Can I take you home?‚Äù, Eddy asked her. ‚ÄúSure, but who are you people?‚Äù, Rita asked. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not important. All that matters is getting home, now come on‚Äù, he told her and evaded her question.



Railway station

8:30 PM

Rita‚Äôs boss, Petey Piper, was at a nearby railway station. He found himself stalked by the creature. As soon as he heard it following him, he ran as fast as he could for the station booth. He attempted to barricade himself inside. He turned the jukebox on to put him at ease. Suddenly, the creature crashed through a window, in the attempt to pounce on him. This creature was a Smilodon, a saber-toothed cat. He screams as he saw the beast. He ran out of the building as fast as he could. A train-spotter named Kenny took pictures of the Smilodon as it chased Petey. The Smilodon caught up to Petey and killed him. In the truck, Eddy, who was with Rita, heard the screaming, and rushed out of the vehicle to investigate with his tranquilizer gun. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back. Need to check this out‚Äù, he told her. ‚ÄúStay here until I get back‚Äù, he ordered. Eddy rushed to the train station and saw the huge Smilodon devouring Petey on the tracks. He was about to shoot with his tranquilizer but before he could, Rita had disobeyed his direct order. ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù, she called out to him. The Smilodon ran into the forest. ‚ÄúI told you to stay put‚Äù, Eddy scolded.



9:00 PM



Ed and April went to talk with Kenny about the article with pictures of the Smilodon that he had uploaded to the internet: It was titled: ‚ÄúBeast In The Park‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhy would you do this, Kenny?‚Äù, April furiously asked. ‚ÄúI just wanted people to know what I saw out there on the railway station‚Äù, Kenny replied. ‚ÄúI will pay you to take this article down tonight‚Äù, April offered. ‚ÄúTrust me you don‚Äôt want people to know about this creature you saw‚Äù, she added. ‚ÄúOk, that‚Äôs fine‚Äù, Kenny said. Kenny walked out for a minute as Ed investigated the picture he had taken of the creature. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Smilodon. Better known by its other name: saber-toothed cat. It‚Äôs a natural born-killer that is fast and elegant. The literal meaning of the name ‚ÄúSmilodon‚Äù is knife-tooth for good reason‚Äù, Ed explained to April. ‚ÄúSo, that wasn‚Äôt a big cat that escaped from a zoo. There really is a creature here‚Äù, Ed said. ‚ÄúScary‚Äù, April commented.



9:05 PM



Ed was concerned about what he found in the pictures, the Smilodon, a powerfully built cat with deadly twin saber-teeth, a truly lethal killing machine. ‚ÄúWell, this can only mean one thing. This is a prehistoric creature and therefore, it could only have come into our time through an anomaly‚Äù, Ed realized.



Mondo A-Go Go



Saturday, September 2, 2006, 9:00 AM



The next morning, the team were in the woods thinking about how they were going to deal with the Smilodon. ‚ÄúWell, then why did my anomaly detector not pick up the anomaly the Smilodon came out of?‚Äù, Double D asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù, Ed said. The team prepared to set traps to catch the Smilodon. Suddenly, Rita came out of nowhere, and seemed visibly agitated by what they were doing, and planning. ‚ÄúGuys, what are you doing?‚Äù, Rita asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Rita‚Äù, Eddy apologized. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a very stressful couple of days‚Äù, Ed said. ‚ÄúI understand Rita. I‚Äôm quite stressed and shocked myself‚Äù, Ed said.

Marie was in a bulldozer digging a pit trap for the Smilodon. She waved to Ed as he passed by with some raw meat in his hands that he would put in the pit trap to lure in the saber-toothed cat. Marie eventually dug deep enough for Ed to set the meat in the pit. Ed set the meat out in the pit for the beast only to find a gruesome discovery: the body of a man buried in a shallow grave. However, before Ed could do anything else, the Smilodon came out of nowhere, and attacked. It was drawn by the smell of the fresh meat they set out for it as bait. It tried to get Ed, but luckily it couldn‚Äôt because he was still in the pit. It swiped at him, but he fortunately dodged it by ducking.



9:12 AM



‚ÄúHey! Over here, kitty!‚Äù, Marie called to it. The Smilodon left Ed alone and closed in on Marie in the bulldozer. She fended it off with the bulldozer and distracted it so Ed could get away. It quickly noticed Ed running away so it went after him again. He saw a zipline course that would make a fast escape from the Smilodon. He started climbing up the tree the zipline course was on, but the Smilodon was too big to climb. It just scratched the foot of the tree. He reached the top and used the zipline on the zipline course only to find the saber-tooth following him from below. He landed at the landing station of the zipline course in easy reach of the Smilodon about to make an easy meal of him. Marie shot at the Smilodon with her tranquilizer gun. She missed, but successfully saved Ed by scaring the monster cat off.



9:30 AM



Ed was back at the grave site and was able to dig the dead man out enough to determine what killed him. He was sliced in half. He told the team about his find on the phone. ‚ÄúGuys, we have a dead body of a man who was cut in half by something. It looks like his corpse has been here for a while. I‚Äôm pretty sure the Smilodon killed him‚Äù, Ed reported to the team. ‚ÄúThat means that the ADD works, it just didn‚Äôt pick up the anomaly that it the Smilodon came through. It must have opened and closed before the ADD came online‚Äù, Double D explained. ‚ÄúExactly, Double D‚Äù, Ed said. ‚ÄúI think we have a more serious problem on our hands, though: while the Smilodon undoubtedly killed the guy, it sure as hell didn‚Äôt dig this trench ten feet deep, and bury his body‚Äù, Ed said. ‚ÄúThat means that someone knows about the Smilodon and has been keeping it in captivity‚Äù, Marie said.



9:35 AM



Eddy‚Äôs brother arrived. ‚ÄúHey, team. April has come up with a cover story that involves East Easton being responsible for an escaped lion‚Äù, Eddy‚Äôs brother said. ‚ÄúWhere is she?‚Äù, Marie asked. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs at his farm‚Äù, Eddy‚Äôs brother said. ‚ÄúWhat are you waiting for, we have to save her from being shot‚Äù, Eddy said. Double D, Eddy, and Marie rushed to the farm to save April.



9:40 AM



They arrived to prevent her from being shot. ‚ÄúLet her go!‚Äù, Double D yelled. ‚ÄúAre you holding a big cat in captivity?‚Äù, Marie asked. ‚ÄúNo. I don‚Äôt know what you are talking about‚Äù, Easton said. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt shoot you, but next time you guys stumble onto my property doing shady stuff, you might not be so lucky‚Äù, Easton said. The team left with April. ‚ÄúHe had no idea of what I was talking about. It‚Äôs safe to say he‚Äôs not hiding the Smilodon‚Äù, Marie said. Meanwhile, back at the grave site, Ed found a wallet on the dead man‚Äôs body. This revealed the true culprit of who was covering up for the Smilodon: none other than Ranger Rita, pictured with the dead man who was her boyfriend. ‚ÄúOh my god‚Äù, Ed commented upon this disturbing discovery.



Ranger Rita‚Äôs house



9:50 AM



At Ranger Rita‚Äôs house, Rita was in her garage feeding the Smilodon some fresh meat. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I won‚Äôt let any one hurt you‚Äù, she told it. Ed arrived at her house and found a photo of her holding a Smilodon kitten. This confirmed that she not only found the Smilodon, but the Smilodon has been living in the modern day for a few years.



9:55 AM



Eddy and the rest of the team were driving on a road through the woods when they suddenly spotted Ranger Rita‚Äôs car heading off in another direction. They followed it, but it turned out to be a diversion, with the driver not being the park ranger, but instead her mechanic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Rita!‚Äù, he yelled. ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù, Eddy apologized.



Ranger Rita‚Äôs house



10:00 AM



Ed walked inside to confront Ranger Rita to find her already aware of his presence with the Smilodon at her side. She had him cornered at the wall and at gunpoint with a shotgun in her hand. ‚ÄúLeave him alone!‚Äù, she yelled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to hurt him, Rita‚Äù, Ed said. ‚Äù One day, 5 years ago, I was in my garage, when a big, glowing light appeared, and the cutest kitten came through it. This beautiful cat is the result of some horrific government experiment and you, and your team are here to destroy him!‚Äù, Rita claimed angrily. ‚ÄúI will shoot you if you come any closer!‚Äù, Rita said angrily. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here to hurt him‚Äù, Ed told him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs killing people and I think it will be safer for both the park visitors, and the cat for the latter to live in a safer place‚Äù, Ed said.



10:05 AM



‚ÄúOne day, he killed my boyfriend Mike in an unfortunate accident. I had no resort but to hide his body in the woods‚Äù, Rita confessed. ‚ÄúThat animal is more than capable of killing us both‚Äù, Ed said. ‚ÄúHe would kill you in a heartbeat, but he wouldn‚Äôt hurt me at all. He has imprinted upon me as his mother and therefore, won‚Äôt harm me‚Äù, Rita said before heading off, and leaving Ed to the Smilodon.



10:07 AM



The Smilodon attacked Ed, but he was able to fend it off with a table that was in front of him. The Smilodon scratched the table. Ed then ran through numerous rooms and then jumped from a balcony. The angry Smilodon pursued him all the while. The angry cat saw him from on the balcony, jumped off, and chased after him from on the ground. Ed saw it coming from behind him and grabbed a pitchfork that was on the ground. He prepared to fight the saber-tooth to his likely death, but suddenly, Rita showed up. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hurt him!‚Äù, the park ranger yelled. ‚ÄúStay away from it, Rita. It will rip you to pieces!‚Äù, Ed warned. The park ranger instead ignored his warnings and tried to comfort the berserk, angry saber-tooth with a calm gesture. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, sweetie‚Äù, she told it. However, the Smilodon interpreted this as a hostile move, and pounced on its owner, turning against her. ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù, Ed yelled. Ed could only watchin horror and sadness as the saber-tooth ripped Ranger Rita to shreds.



10:10 AM



The team arrived and Eddy shot the saber-tooth with his tranquilizer gun. This tranquilized the beast and it dozed off, but unfortunately, it had already killed its adoptive mother. ‚ÄúMore people like Ranger Rita will die if we don‚Äôt make knowledge of the anomalies public‚Äù, Eddy told Ed as they walked off. ‚ÄúI bet you told her what we were doing‚Äù, Ed accused him. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell her, but now I wish I did‚Äù, Eddy said.



Peach Creek ARC



1:30 PM



Ed sat in his office at the Peach Creek ARC. Eddy‚Äôs brother came in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to inform you Ed that the Smilodon sadly died being transported back to the Peach Creek ARC‚Äù, Eddy‚Äôs brother told Ed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe you. It was perfectly healthy‚Äù, Ed said. ‚ÄúMaybe it died of shock‚Äù, Eddy‚Äôs brother replied. ‚ÄúPlease do a post-mortem for him‚Äù, Ed told him. ‚ÄúTo stop the spread of disease, we had to destroy it‚Äôs body‚Äù, Eddy‚Äôs brother replied. Suddenly, the ADD went off, indicating that there was an active anomaly. Ed joined the rest of the team to go off and investigate. ‚ÄúSarah won‚Äôt be happy about this‚Äù, Double D told Marie. ‚ÄúAnd why is that, Double D?‚Äù, Marie asked. ‚ÄúI planned a date with her‚Äù, Double D replied. ‚ÄúOh, how horrible‚Äù, Marie said sarcastically.



1:40 PM



While the team was off on another incursion, Sarah was in a secluded area on the grounds of the Peach Creek ARC waiting for Eddy‚Äôs brother, who she was working for. He arrived and paid her for more information on Marie, and Double D for his own purposes, of course. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay you this amount of money for more information about Double D, and Marie‚Äù, he told her. ‚ÄúOk, sounds like a good deal, boss‚Äù, Sarah replied. Eddy‚Äôs brother smiled nefariously.



The end credits roll‚Ä¶



Next time on Ed, Edd N Eddy Primeval Season 2‚Ä¶



After a teenager mysteriously disappears in the cul-de-sac, the team investigate, and save April from a narrow death at the jaws of a highly unusual shark they find lurking in the Peach Creek Canals. Ed is convinced that the shark‚Äôs unique morphology is the result of further evolution and therefore, it‚Äôs a species of creature from the future. They then split up to find the creature‚Äôs lair but trouble brews when Marie Kanker is dragged through an anomaly by another carnivorous species from the future: the Mer Creature.

When we met,
You are ‚Äú—á—É–¥–æ.‚Äù
Because I have never met anyone so wonderful,
Not before, not after.

You were pure innocence in its earliest form,
You were faith in a bright future,
You were trembling trust
That no one would ever hurt you.

And I hurt you.
Offended you, betrayed you,
Decided for both of us,
Ignored your needs,
Violated you, used you,
Wiped my feet on you.

You prayed and cried that day,
When frightened, you hid under the table from me.
And I was silent,
Saying I‚Äôd never hurt you again, that there would be no more pain,
And then still did what I wanted to do.

Did you want to be with me? Sadly, yes.
Because you always chose those who loved you,
And never the ones you loved.
Did you want such a fate? Surely not.
Would you wish such a man for your daughter?
I think you‚Äôd hide her from him in a castle guarded by a dragon.

I‚Äôm sorry I turned out not to be a prince,

A pig in relationships,
A rat in meeting your needs.
You wouldn‚Äôt even need a zoo with me,
I am nature itself in its worst state.

I am the one who would grab you by the hair
And carry you into a cave to do whatever he wants.
I am a killer of souls, a poacher, a punisher,
A waiter who‚Äôd spill coffee on you
If you didn‚Äôt tip him.

How much more you deserve,
And why did you choose me?
You didn‚Äôt choose anyone.
You just picked the one
Who said he chose you.

Why do the best people end up with the biggest scoundrels?
And why can I no longer rejoice in that?

1ojfs5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exsplore/comments/1ojfs5c/whats_the_best_itineraries_for_south_america/,What's the best itineraries for South America?,"Planning a trip through [South America](https://www.britannica.com/place/South-America) can feel overwhelming at first. The continent is huge, and every country offers a completely different experience. You can go from hiking through glaciers in Patagonia to swimming in the Caribbean in the same month. Because of that, building the right itinerary depends on balancing distance, cost, time, and what kind of experiences you actually want. Many travelers underestimate just how long it takes to move between destinations, so good planning makes all the difference.

A big question people ask is how long they need. Technically, you could spend years exploring the continent, but most people have one to two months. [1 month](https://www.shallwegohometravel.com/1-month-south-america-itinerary/) is enough to see a few regions properly if you focus your route. Trying to visit every major highlight in four weeks usually leads to burnout, long bus rides, and wasted time in transit. It‚Äôs better to pick one region and go deeper, or choose two neighboring countries that connect well by land.

Another common question is which countries are best for first-time visitors. [Peru](https://peru.travel/) is often at the top of the list because it offers a mix of history, culture, mountains, and food. You can easily connect Lima, Cusco, Machu Picchu, and Lake Titicaca with short flights or buses. Chile and Argentina are also great options for nature lovers. The Patagonia region between them has some of the best hiking in the world, though it can be more expensive and weather-dependent. Colombia works well if you prefer beaches, music, and a more tropical atmosphere. It is also more affordable and easy to travel around compared to the southern cone.

If you want a classic [one-month South America itinerary](https://www.shallwegohometravel.com/1-month-south-america-itinerary/) that includes many of the main attractions, you could start in Ecuador, travel south through Peru and Bolivia, and finish in northern Chile. This route includes the Andes mountains, Incan ruins, colonial cities, the Salt Flats, and the Atacama Desert. It works well for overland travel and gives a strong sense of the continent‚Äôs geography and culture. Another good option is to focus on the Patagonia circuit, splitting time between Chile and Argentina, which offers glaciers, lakes, and world-class trails. If you want warmer weather and a slower pace, the northern route through Colombia, Ecuador, and northern Peru includes beaches, jungles, and cities that are vibrant but not too far apart.

One thing that confuses many travelers is how to handle transportation. Buses are common, but distances can be extreme. A single ride between major cities can take 20 hours or more. Flights save time but can be pricey, especially if booked last minute. A good balance is to travel overland within one country and fly between regions. Low-cost airlines like Sky, Jetsmart, and Viva often have affordable options if booked in advance.

Another question that comes up often is when to go. Because South America crosses both [hemispheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemispheres_of_Earth), seasons can be opposite depending on where you are. The dry season in the Andes, from May to October, is ideal for hiking and visiting Machu Picchu. Patagonia is best from November to March, which is summer in the south. The Amazon region is humid year-round, while coastal Colombia and northern Peru stay warm most of the year. If you plan well, you can design your trip to chase good weather across multiple regions.

People also ask about safety and budgeting. In general, South America is safe for tourists who use common sense, but every country has areas to avoid. Major cities often have petty theft, so basic precautions go a long way. Budgets vary a lot between countries. Argentina and Bolivia can be affordable, while Chile and Brazil are pricier. Daily costs for a budget traveler average around 40 to 60 USD, though Patagonia can push that higher. Overnight buses and hostels help reduce costs, while street food and local menus are both cheap and good.

When it comes to culture and language, [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language_in_South_America) helps enormously. English is not widely spoken outside major tourist spots, and even a few basic phrases can make your trip smoother. Each country also has distinct customs and food. Peru is famous for its cuisine, Argentina for steak and wine, and Colombia for coffee and music. Trying regional dishes and talking to locals adds a lot to the experience and often leads to unplanned highlights that no itinerary can capture.

Finally, one of the most important things to understand when planning a South America itinerary is that less is more. It‚Äôs easy to get carried away by all the bucket-list destinations, but most travelers who rush regret not spending more time in fewer places. Choose two or three major regions that really interest you and leave room for flexibility. The distances, climate changes, and border crossings can slow you down, so it helps to plan for rest days and local experiences instead of constant movement.

In the end, there is no single ‚Äúbest‚Äù [itinerary for South America](https://www.shallwegohometravel.com/1-month-south-america-itinerary/). The best route depends on what kind of traveler you are. Some people love long bus rides and discovering small towns, while others want to see as many famous sights as possible. Whether you focus on the Andes, the Amazon, Patagonia, or the beaches of Brazil and Colombia, every route offers something completely unique. What matters most is balancing ambition with realism so that you can enjoy the journey without feeling rushed.

If you had one or two months in South America, which route would you choose? Would you focus on a few countries or try to see as many highlights as possible? What kind of [itinerary](https://www.shallwegohometravel.com/1-month-south-america-itinerary/) do you think best captures the spirit of the continent?",1,1761770003.0,Exsplore,0,1.0,False

As the kringle curator for O&H Danish Bakery, I welcome the shorter days as folks don sweaters and flannel to stay cozy and comfy. Even better? Our bakery is alive with the unmistakable fall aroma of cinnamon in the air.

This spice is fundamental to our Danish baking heritage. Danish folklore suggests that a pinch of cinnamon keeps spirits warm through the darker months, a small safeguard against the chill. That sentiment has been part of our bakery since its founding, with recipes that use cinnamon to create a sense of comfort and contentment.

But the real power of cinnamon lies in its connection to memory. Its scent can transport you back in time‚Äîto a grandmother's kitchen, a holiday gathering, or that first bite of a warm pastry on a crisp day. It‚Äôs an ingredient that ties moments together.

That‚Äôs why we feature it so prominently in our fall pastries. It‚Äôs the star of our Cinnamon Roll Kringle and the perfect complement to the flavors in our other seasonal pastries, like the Harvest Coffee Cake and Apple Cinnamon Kringle Pie. For us, using cinnamon isn‚Äôt just about flavor, it‚Äôs about upholding a tradition and sharing a feeling of home that has been passed down for over 70 years.

At¬†**La Mode Men‚Äôs**, we believe that mastering business casual isn‚Äôt just about following a dress code; it‚Äôs about expressing your confidence, competence, and individuality through thoughtful style.

# Understanding Business Casual: A Contemporary Perspective

The term¬†*business casual*¬†originated in the late 20th century as workplaces began to move away from rigid formalwear. Gone were the days when every man was expected to wear a full suit and tie from nine to five. The modern workplace calls for flexibility ‚Äî attire that communicates respect and professionalism while accommodating creativity and comfort.

**Business casual is not about dressing down; it‚Äôs about dressing right.**¬†It sits in the sweet spot between formal suits and casual weekend wear. Think of it as a relaxed form of professional dressing ‚Äî less structured but still intentional. The goal is to look approachable, confident, and capable without appearing overdressed or underprepared.

At¬†**La Mode Men‚Äôs**, we interpret business casual as¬†**refined functionality**¬†‚Äî polished pieces that can transition from meetings to social hours seamlessly. Our mission is to help men feel their best while projecting competence, creativity, and modern elegance.

# Building the Business Casual Wardrobe: The Essential Pieces

Every great wardrobe starts with well-chosen basics that mix and match effortlessly. When curating a business casual rotation, focus on timeless pieces that offer both comfort and sophistication.

# 1. The Perfect Shirts

Button-down dress shirts remain the backbone of business casual. Start with crisp white and light blue shirts ‚Äî two shades that complement almost every outfit. For variety, add subtle patterns such as checks, stripes, or micro-prints to showcase your personality.

For a softer, laid-back edge, include¬†**polo shirts**¬†and¬†**knit collared tops**. They bring versatility to your wardrobe while maintaining a neat, structured silhouette.

La Mode Men‚Äôs recommends choosing shirts in breathable cotton, cotton-blend, or linen fabrics for year-round wear. Pair them with a¬†**solid or patterned tie**¬†from our¬†[La Mode Men‚Äôs Tie Collection]()¬†for a touch of personality that sets you apart.

# 2. Smart Trousers and Chinos

Chinos are the cornerstone of modern business casual. They strike the perfect balance between relaxed and refined ‚Äî ideal for both office days and evening outings. Choose neutral tones such as navy, beige, gray, or olive for maximum versatility.

Tailored trousers in lightweight wool or cotton-stretch blends elevate your look when paired with button-downs and blazers. For creative workplaces, dark-wash jeans (without distressing) can also fit within the business casual spectrum when styled thoughtfully.

A well-fitted pair of pants communicates precision and care ‚Äî two hallmarks of the La Mode Men‚Äôs aesthetic.

# 3. The Business Casual Blazer

If there‚Äôs one item that instantly transforms your outfit, it‚Äôs the¬†**unstructured blazer**. Opt for lightweight fabrics like cotton twill, linen, or wool blends. A navy or charcoal blazer complements nearly any combination of trousers and shirts.

Blazers are not only for meetings; they‚Äôre your ticket to instant polish. Throw one over a polo for a smart-casual lunch or over a button-down for a formal client pitch.

Remember, the key lies in fit ‚Äî the blazer should contour your shoulders without restriction, with sleeves that allow just a hint of shirt cuff to show.

# 4. Shoes that Seal the Look

Your footwear tells a story. While sneakers dominate casual wardrobes, business casual leans toward¬†**loafers, brogues, oxfords, and derbies**. For a more contemporary spin, minimalist leather sneakers can also work ‚Äî provided they‚Äôre impeccably clean and sleek.

Brown and tan tones are ideal complements to navy and gray outfits, while black shoes maintain timeless appeal. Complete the look with a¬†**coordinated leather belt**¬†and watch for an elevated finishing touch.

# 5. Accessories that Speak Elegance

Accessories bring personality and depth to business casual outfits. A silk tie in a subtle solid or pattern from La Mode Men‚Äôs instantly sharpens your ensemble. Add a pocket square for flair or a wristwatch for understated authority.

Cufflinks, tie bars, and lapel pins can be introduced sparingly to enhance sophistication ‚Äî not overwhelm it. The goal is harmony: accessories should complement, not compete with, your outfit.

# Shirts and Tops: From Casual to Commanding

The right shirt does more than cover your torso ‚Äî it defines your presence. In business casual styling, shirts bridge the formality gap between professional dress codes and personal expression.

Start with a¬†**foundation of solid hues**¬†such as white, light blue, and soft gray. These colors convey clarity, dependability, and confidence ‚Äî traits that every professional wants to project.

Once your essentials are in place, experiment with¬†**patterns and textures**. Subtle checks, pinstripes, and micro-dots can convey creativity without appearing loud.

For creative or tech-forward environments,¬†**polo shirts**¬†and¬†**merino-wool pullovers**¬†layered over collared shirts can create depth and warmth. The trick is to maintain neatness ‚Äî always ensure your shirt is tucked, sleeves are properly buttoned, and collars are crisp.

**La Mode Men‚Äôs Tip:**¬†Pair a patterned tie with a solid shirt or vice versa to maintain visual balance. Visit our¬†[Pattern Tie Collection]()¬†to explore bold yet professional designs that transform any business casual look into a statement of taste.

# Bottoms and Beyond: Perfecting the Lower Half

Your trousers anchor your outfit‚Äôs personality. In the business casual realm,¬†**fit, fabric, and finish**¬†make all the difference.

* **Chinos**: The most adaptable piece in your wardrobe. Pair beige chinos with navy blazers or olive chinos with cream shirts for relaxed sophistication.
* **Dress trousers**: Ideal for presentations or semi-formal events. Choose tailored cuts that complement your physique without being overly tight.
* **Dark jeans**: Reserved for offices with relaxed dress codes, dark jeans offer a modern edge when paired with structured blazers or dress shirts.

To complete your look, select¬†**quality leather accessories**¬†‚Äî a belt that matches your shoes, a refined wristwatch, and if appropriate, a leather briefcase or messenger bag.

Business casual style succeeds when every detail works in harmony ‚Äî trousers, shirts, shoes, and accessories blending into one cohesive statement.

# Seasonal Adaptations: Dressing Smart All Year Round

A truly sophisticated man knows how to adapt his wardrobe to the changing seasons without losing his style identity.

# Spring & Summer

Opt for¬†**lightweight fabrics**¬†such as linen, cotton, or seersucker. Soft color palettes ‚Äî sky blue, sand, white, and light gray ‚Äî exude freshness. Loafers and unlined blazers help you stay cool while maintaining structure.

# Autumn

Introduce¬†**richer tones**¬†like burgundy, forest green, and navy. Layer shirts with lightweight sweaters or cardigans. Textured fabrics such as tweed or brushed cotton add depth and warmth.

# Winter

Business casual in winter is all about¬†**layering with intention**. Start with a dress shirt, add a fine-knit sweater or vest, and top with a wool blazer or overcoat. Keep your palette deep and sophisticated ‚Äî charcoal, black, and midnight blue are timeless winter choices.

**Pro Tip from La Mode Men‚Äôs:**¬†Always ensure your outerwear complements your outfit beneath. A mismatched overcoat can disrupt even the most polished ensemble.

# From Desk to Dinner: The Art of Transition

One of the biggest advantages of business casual style is its flexibility. With the right layering, you can easily transition from daytime meetings to evening events without a full wardrobe change.

* Swap your formal dress shoes for loafers.
* Lose the tie and unbutton your collar for a relaxed dinner look.
* Keep a versatile blazer handy to elevate your outfit instantly.

La Mode Men‚Äôs business casual philosophy celebrates this versatility ‚Äî enabling you to move through your day confidently, knowing your outfit adapts as smoothly as your schedule.

# Color Coordination: The Silent Language of Style

Colors play a subtle but powerful role in how you‚Äôre perceived. In the world of business casual, balance is key.

* **Neutrals**¬†(white, navy, gray, beige) form your foundation.
* **Accent colors**¬†(burgundy, olive, cobalt, sand) add personality.
* **Contrasts**¬†(light shirt + dark trousers or vice versa) keep the outfit dynamic.

When in doubt, let your tie or pocket square be the focal point. A¬†**La Mode Men‚Äôs tie**¬†in deep sapphire blue or sleek charcoal can elevate even the simplest shirt.

Remember ‚Äî understated coordination communicates confidence; over-matching suggests over-compensation.

# The Psychology of Business Casual

Dressing well isn‚Äôt vanity ‚Äî it‚Äôs strategy. Studies consistently show that attire affects self-perception, confidence, and even performance.

When you look good, you feel in control. Business casual empowers men to present themselves as approachable leaders: relaxed yet authoritative, stylish yet grounded.

At¬†**La Mode Men‚Äôs**, every shirt, tie, and blazer is designed to embody that balance ‚Äî giving you the psychological edge to command presence in every room you enter.

# Conclusion: Redefining Modern Professional Style

Business casual is more than a dress code ‚Äî it‚Äôs a mindset. It‚Äôs about embracing modern professionalism with comfort, flexibility, and confidence.

**La Mode Men‚Äôs**¬†reimagines the business casual wardrobe for today‚Äôs dynamic man. Whether you‚Äôre attending a team meeting, leading a client pitch, or enjoying post-work cocktails, our curated pieces help you look effortlessly refined.

We sat there for almost 2 hrs and talked about how my friend can move on from his mess up post breakup relationship. Actually he is still in contact with her ex. She shares her new relationship moments/pics with him through social media. He ends up being in depression. I advised him that instead of coldly blocking her and get meltdown if she contact again later, just talk to her and tell her that you want to keep your path separate from her life and then say goodbye. It was beneficial for him and he said he will do that but in all that conversation i told him that these ways are the ones i used practically when i was in my suffering.
I felt sad after this conversation like i always end up being in supporting my friends and when it's my time, i have to to that on myself. It hurts like when you are the avtive listeners in your friend group. But when it's your time to share your griefs, no one is interested.

1ojfhek,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorfan1/comments/1ojfhek/the_voice_on_my_cousins_baby_monitor/,The voice on my cousins baby monitor,"When my cousin asked me to babysit her son, I didn‚Äôt hesitate.
It was a Friday evening in February she and her husband wanted just one night out after months of sleepless newborn chaos. I told her to relax and take her time. The baby was only six months old, always quiet, and they had one of those fancy Wi-Fi baby monitors that connected straight to an app. The baby went down easily at 8:30. I settled on the sofa with Netflix and a cup of tea, the monitor propped on the coffee table. The little green light blinked steadily. Everything felt calm. Peaceful.

At about ten o‚Äôclock, I heard the first sound through the monitor. A faint rustle, like fabric shifting. Then a small whimper. I glanced at the screen the baby was still lying on his back, eyes closed. I figured he was dreaming. Then I heard it again.But this time, it wasn‚Äôt the baby.

It was a voice.
Soft. Low.
A man‚Äôs voice.
Saying something I couldn‚Äôt quite make out.

I froze, thinking maybe it was a neighbor the walls in my sister‚Äôs semi-detached house weren‚Äôt thick. But the sound was coming through the monitor, not from the room itself. I muted the TV. The voice came again, a little clearer this time.
It said, almost gently,
‚ÄúShh. Go back to sleep.‚Äù

I ran upstairs so fast I nearly tripped. When I burst into the nursery, the room was exactly as it should be: baby in the cot, nightlight glowing, nothing out of place. The only sound was the slow ticking of the little owl-shaped clock on the shelf. there was no one there. I checked the windows ‚Äî locked.
Cupboard ‚Äî empty.
Even under the cot ‚Äî nothing.

I told myself it must have been interference. Maybe a neighbor‚Äôs baby monitor on the same frequency, or some weird Wi-Fi glitch. I went back downstairs and stared at the screen for a long time.it was quiet again too quiet. At midnight, I started to doze off. Then, suddenly, the monitor crackled that same static hiss and I heard the voice again. Closer this time it said ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs awake‚Äù. The baby wasn‚Äôt. I could see him, still sleeping peacefully. Then, after a pause, the voice whispered ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here.‚Äù

I remember standing up so fast the mug fell off the table and smashed. My whole body went cold. I called my cousin immediately she answered on the third ring, half-asleep and confused. I told her what I‚Äôd heard, trying not to sound hysterical. She said she and her husband had noticed strange sounds on the monitor too whispering, footsteps, sometimes faint breathing but they assumed it was feedback or interference from their Wi-Fi signal. The company had even sent a replacement monitor a week before.

Then she said something that made my blood run cold.
‚ÄúThe old one‚Äôs still plugged in,‚Äù she said slowly.
‚ÄúIn the attic.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt go back upstairs to check.
I just grabbed my keys, the baby, and left the house.

The police came later and found the monitor in the attic, still connected, still powered on.
But it wasn‚Äôt faulty.
Someone had hardwired it into a small camera system the kind you can control remotely. They never found out who was accessing it.
But when they checked the Wi-Fi log, there had been two devices connected to the network that night.
Mine.
And one labelled simply
‚ÄúMonitor Admin.‚Äù

I'm 22F recently turned 22. I graduated with my associates degree and got a full time job right away. I'm in school part time right now to complete my bachelor's degree. I make good money a year, at least what I think is good money (86k gross) and live with my boyfriend 25M, I have two dogs I've had since I was 16 that live with my parents and we just recently got a cat in our apartment (thinking of getting a second one), Im financially responsible for all three of them. I bought a brand new car last year and I traveled last year out of the country for the first time with my work friends and doing so again in January 2026. I have friends but I don't really hang out with them unless it's with my boyfriend or friends from work when and if we happen to plan something. Not because I don't want too, but because when I reach out it never seems like anyone is interested. My boyfriend and I have joked about being ""cool"" but he was honest with me and was like in general I don't think you're cool, you're cool to me though. Which kinda hurt my feelings. I never had the college experience I went to community College and lived with my very strict parents. I drank a little in high school as well as smoked but I only really did that sort of thing when I turned 21. Halloween is right around the corner and I have zero plans. My boyfriend just said his cousins coworker invited him to a Halloween party and hes just telling me. Im not invited and i work the day of the party anyway. Everyone around me is either going to a party or doing something fun, except me. I love Halloween. This is a consistent trend in my life and I try not to feel left out, out of the loop, or generally feel unwanted. However that's really hard for me at times, considering this is how my life has been and how I felt since I was a child. I guess my real question is, am I missing out on my twenties? I spend so much time on my career, paying off my car, hanging out with my pets and indulging the hobbies i like, like coffee, crocheting, crafting, just super ""boring"" things but I want to go out and have fun as well. I feel like Im 40 even though Im 22. I just want to make it clear Im super grateful for what I gave especially in this economy and with everything going on, I just can't help it that I feel like I'm going to regret not having fun, or I'm the problem and reason I can't have fun.

I‚Äôve always been anxious and i‚Äôve been diagnosed with PMDD and MDD, i was on prozac last year for about 4 months (10mg and 20mg before my period) but i went off it. 
I started my junior year of college and the first couple weeks were fine I was a little stressed out about all my classes and finances, and my grandma got diagnosed with colon cancer but nothing too crazy stressful. Then around mid september I started to get these weird feelings of panic/anxiety in class or on the bus which freaked me out because that‚Äôs never really happened before (almost like an out of body experience?) and i also fell into a mini depression (probably because i don‚Äôt do anything on the weekends). 
Recently it‚Äôs been so bad I live about 2.5 hours from my college and when i would come home i would freak out about driving that long, and even now i freak out when i have to drive 20 min. It‚Äôs hard to go to class sometimes because i worry that I will have a panic attack in class or on the bus. I went to the doctor and they put me on prozac again as well as hydroxyzine but I just started taking it so I haven‚Äôt seen much change yet other than the hydroxyz making me very sleepy. I have also cut out caffeine for about 3 weeks (i‚Äôve been drinking coffee since i was 15) because I fear it will make me so anxious i will pass out in front of everyone or when driving.  
I need to get to a therapist but it‚Äôs hard out here because i‚Äôll have to go through the process of getting one but is there any advice or validation? I just hate feeling like this, I envy me 2 months ago because i really struggle leaving the house. ",1,1761769015.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

Probably deserves a place in the unsent music page but that James Blunt song popped into my head.

The irony. 

That back to bedlam cd helped me get through so much back in the day. ‚ÄúGetting over you‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think I ever really got over you. But i said goodbye to the you i knew. Because you said goodbye to us. And said we would be friends and then you didn‚Äôt even do that. So fitting.

Who knows if i will ever know the whole story.

I wanted to go to that James Blunt concert a few months ago so bad. But my man refused to go. He didn‚Äôt even ask how much it meant to me. Or if there would be more.

I couldn‚Äôt even tell you the disappointment. 

How is this man the one I am with for life? He tells me he loves me? But he doesn‚Äôt even care to find out how much something means to me when i said is wanted to go. We are only 1.5 away from where the concert venue was. And money is not the issue. 
He just didn‚Äôt care. He doesn‚Äôt care i like music‚Ä¶

Unfortunate for me. Because if you were my love and friend‚Ä¶ i know we would have been there. 

Even now ‚Äútrying‚Äù to be friends‚Ä¶ i know you care. But idk if you will ever be able to look at me as a friend. You‚Äôre probably singing the same damn song in your head wishing that you were him. And that you didn‚Äôt have to say goodbye to the what ifs because life is happening.

I have kids. You have kids. We live completely different lives that can‚Äôt be uprooted without true consequences. So what else is there to say besides goodbye? 

At least that‚Äôs what it feels like. Is it even hello if our friendship never leaves the DMs? Is it a friendship if you never meet up for a round of drinks or to chat over coffee? I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ i guess we are just modern day pen pals ‚Äúfriend‚Äù",1,1761768843.0,UnsentLetters,3,0.67,False
