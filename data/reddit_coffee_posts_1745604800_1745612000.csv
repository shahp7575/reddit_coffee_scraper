I‚Äôm a single FTM and my baby is formula fed , it‚Äôs great I love it it‚Äôs not why I feel like I‚Äôm failing.  
It‚Äôs because my baby doesn‚Äôt really eat solids, he kind of does like he will eat some Cheerios and puffs and certain very specific puree‚Ä¶ he eats forager yogurt . He has so many different food allergies . No cow dairy no peanuts no soy no wheat , almost all of those listed are anaphylactic allergies and he has epi pens.   
   
I really can‚Äôt wrap my head around the thought that he shouldn‚Äôt be formula fed by 12 months old. There‚Äôs just no way that‚Äôs going to happen.   
 
People have told me ‚Äújust feed him whatever you eat‚Äù but the problem here is that I don‚Äôt really eat like that ü§£ like no mam I can‚Äôt feed my baby coffee and a vape and Cheeto puffs.     
  
What does a baby even eat? Please don‚Äôt come for me; I know I sound like an unfit mother but I promise i am a very caring mom that loves my baby but I just am struggling here. And before you judge me too much just know that we‚Äôve spent a lot of time in the hospital and DV shelters that didn‚Äôt even ALLOW food so i haven‚Äôt been purposely withholding solids from him.   
  
Also‚Ä¶ he doesn‚Äôt want to eat sour cold ass pur√©es for every meal that are 80% apple sauce that doesn‚Äôt even seem healthy or ‚Äúright‚Äù and I cannot prepare a 6 course baby meal 3 times a day like I see online, so what the heck please help me learn to feed my baby by dropping some suggestions .

1k7uhln,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k7uhln/struggling_to_lose_weight_rant/,struggling to lose weight (rant),"I (24F, 5'6"", 249 pounds) have been trying to lose weight for the past couple of years. My dream is to be down to 150 pounds by August 2026 but I doubt that will happen because no matter what I do the weight doesn't seem to shift, or if it does shift it just comes back despite me sticking to my calorie deficit.

Anyways, this all started in 2022 when I absolutely ballooned, going from 13 stone to 18 stone in less than a year. I still don't fully understand what happened, the only thing different that happened that year was that I got covid in March 2022 and I've struggled with random bouts of tiredness and fatigue ever since. Despite the random tiredness I keep to the same routine I've had since I was 16: I go to the gym 3-5 times a week, maintain a balanced diet, still sleep 9 hours a night, still drink 2-3 litres of water a day. Nobody seems to believe me when I share this. My mum claimed I must sneak unhealthy foods when I'm working (impossible btw I work in a clinical environment), my friend thinks I'm not being honest with myself about what I eat. It's taken certain scenarios (staying with my cousin for a week and cooking meals in front of her, going on holiday with my parents for a week and eating and exercising the same amount as they do, going on a camping trip with my friend and eating and exercising identically to her after which she lost 5 pounds and I managed to gain 3) for people to take me seriously about not doing anything particularly wrong.

 I eat 1700-1800 calories a day, I go for regular walks, I drink water and green tea, I treat myself to one sugary coffee a week but I keep that within my calories. I don't like fizzy drinks or juice so those have never been worries for me. I don't drink alcohol. I can't afford to eat out/takeout often except for once every few weeks if I go to lunch with a friend or for a special occasion. I love salads, I love vegetables, I love the food I eat so it's nothing to do with being unsatisfied. I'm not particularly stressed in life with anything except my weight, I sleep well most nights. 

I managed to lose over a stone last October, and then gained it back and more without changing my diet or routine at all. I have no idea why my weight keeps rising and I'm so painfully frustrated with it all at this point. My friends and family are insisting I see a doctor but the last three times I tried they just recommended me diets and claimed I needed to be honest with myself. It honestly makes me wanna scream and cry because I AM being honest, but nobody wants to hear the truth because it doesn't align with their beliefs about me, I have to be a (quote from a family member) ""disgusting pig who can't control herself."" And if anyone's wondering if my weight is muscle related or anything, I doubt it. My waist is a lovely 46 inches and my double chin is growing by the day. 

I honestly can't even look in a mirror without wanting to cry. I don't know why this is happening and I just want to rant about it somewhere and beg for advice. At one point I debated lowering my calories to 1500-1600 but my cousin (a nurse) lectured me about the risks of eating too little and how unhealthy that is for someone of my height with my exercise regime. My friend thinks it might be PCOS but even if it is there's nothing they can do about it (aside from me taking the pill and I refuse to put myself through that ever again).

 Does anyone have any idea what the heck I should do from here? I'm hovering close to 18 stone all over again and I'm fed up of my weight bouncing around when I feel like I'm doing everything right.",1,1745611570.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

1k7uf3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1k7uf3f/ex_broke_up_with_me_2_weeks_ago_she_told_me_a/,"Ex broke up with me 2 weeks ago. She told me a large part of her wants to be back together, but we need space. She went abroad for a week. She‚Äôs back Sunday. Should I text her when she‚Äôs back?","I‚Äôve been going through a really painful breakup with my ex, Tori. We were together for over a year and shared a deep connection, similar values, and genuine love. But toward the end of our relationship, we struggled‚Äîespecially around emotional safety and conflict. I have a history of emotional numbness and defensiveness from childhood trauma, and during fights, I often shut down. She‚Äôs more anxious in conflict, so we fell into a tough pursue-withdraw cycle that neither of us fully knew how to navigate.

Another hard part was that I expressed at one point that I was struggling with attraction. I now realize that my attraction is deeply tied to emotional connection, and when we were stuck in a negative loop, it clouded how I saw her. She didn‚Äôt feel chosen or good enough‚Äîand I deeply regret how I made her feel.

Tori broke up with me about two weeks ago. On April 20th, which was her birthday, we had a long and beautiful conversation. I sent her a heartfelt message about how much I love her and how much she means to me. We both expressed that we still love each other very much. She told me that a big part of her still sees a future with me, but that she needs space and time to find herself again‚Äîto become ‚Äúhappy Tori‚Äù without relying on a relationship to feel whole.

Since the breakup, I‚Äôve been honoring that space. I‚Äôve been working hard on myself‚Äîdoing neurofeedback, starting trauma and IFS parts work, and reflecting on the patterns I want to change. I know I contributed to the emotional misattunement in our relationship, and I‚Äôm committed to healing that. I don‚Äôt want to get back together unless we‚Äôre both in a much healthier, more secure place.

She‚Äôs currently on a trip to Europe with her friend, and I haven‚Äôt contacted her at all while she‚Äôs been away. But I‚Äôve been thinking about her a lot. I want to send her a simple message when she gets back‚Äîsomething like:

‚ÄúHey, I hope your trip was amazing. I‚Äôve been thinking of you and just wanted to send that your way.‚Äù

My question is:
Would sending that message be violating the space she asked for? Or would it be okay since it‚Äôs light, non-pushy, and from a calm, grounded place‚Äînot a plea or a bid to fix things?

Also:
Would it be appropriate to reach out about a month from now to ask her to get coffee‚Äînot to convince her of anything, but to genuinely share the work I‚Äôve been doing and give her space to reflect, too?",1,1745611395.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1k7uagy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1k7uagy/should_you_choose_the_home_vision_fixed_tv_wall/,Should You Choose the HOME VISION Fixed TV Wall Mount Review? Find Out!,"**A Practical Review of HOME VISION Fixed TV Wall Mount (HV8601)**  

The HOME VISION Fixed TV Wall Mount (HV8601) quickly stood out as a game-changer when I decided to upgrade the way my entertainment setup functioned. My living room had been plagued by a massive TV stand that hogged space and caused frequent dusting nightmares. The wall mount promised features like a low-profile design, robust compatibility, and ease of installation‚Äîall of which were exactly what I needed. While my overall experience has been positive, there are a few aspects buyers should keep in mind.

**Minimalistic and Space-Saving Design**  
Sometimes less is more, and this wall mount perfectly embodies that principle. After installation, my television sat just one inch away from the wall, giving it that sleek, modern look you often see in home interior catalogs. It‚Äôs incredible how much space it freed up‚Äîsuddenly, my room didn't feel like I was navigating around a giant obstacle. The slim, low-profile design made the flat-screen blend naturally into the wall, almost like a built-in feature. When company visited, they were all curious about what kind of wizardry made my TV appear to ‚Äúfloat‚Äù.  
[Time to see HOME VISION Fixed TV Wall Mount (HV8601) cost on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/p/b08t8w3ld2/)  

**Ease of Installation**  
I am not someone you‚Äôd describe as ‚Äúhandy,‚Äù yet putting up this mount felt like a walk in the park. The manufacturer claimed it would only take 10 minutes, and sure enough, I had this done just as I was finishing my second cup of coffee. It comes with well-documented instructions and all necessary screws, which is refreshing since I‚Äôve faced my fair share of cryptic manuals from other products. That said, I‚Äôd highly recommend sticking to the manufacturer‚Äôs guideline on avoiding direct installation on drywall‚Äîa couple of my friends learned this the hard way, and trust me, no one likes a collapsing TV. Studs or concrete only, people!  

**Remarkable Compatibility and Strength**  
This was a key factor that sold me on this product‚Äîit works with TVs ranging from 32 inches to a whopping 86 inches, with a maximum weight capacity of 165 lbs. My TV isn‚Äôt a small one by any means, yet the sturdy alloy steel build made it feel like I could hang a full-grown adult from it. If you‚Äôre someone who switches TVs now and then, this mount‚Äôs broad compatibility works to your advantage. Its VESA compatibility, reaching up to 600x400mm, ensured my current TV and any potential future upgrade would fit without issue.  

**Benefits**  
- Space-saving design that adds a modern touch to any room.  
- Straightforward installation process with included screws and instruction manual.  
- Exceptional weight capacity ensures durability and stability for heavier TVs.  

**User-Friendly Features**  
What truly set this mount apart for me was its pull-lock and release design. Adjusting the TV has never been easier, and I no longer have to wrestle or contort myself to access the back of the television. A simple tug of the strap, and voila‚Äîaccess is yours. For someone who frequently switches between devices‚Äîgaming consoles, streaming devices, and occasionally a Blu-ray player‚Äîthis is an absolute time-saver.

**Potential Areas for Improvement**  
Although it‚Äôs a great product, I did find a couple of things that could be improved for an even better user experience.  
- Limited adjustability: As a fixed mount, you sacrifice the ability to tilt or swivel the screen, which might be a deal-breaker for spaces that require angled viewing.  
- Hardware variety: The selection of screws and anchors worked for me, but if your wall is unconventional, you might need to upgrade to heavy-duty anchors or bolts.  
- Wall clearance: While the low-profile design is sleek, having just an inch of clearance might make some TV cable setups a bit cumbersome.

**Alternative Offerings**  
Comparing it to other mounts in the same price range, the HOME VISION Fixed TV Wall Mount holds its own pretty well. I‚Äôve tested products from Sanus and Mounting Dream before. Sanus does have more versatile mounting options (tilting and swiveling), but it tends to come at a higher price point. Mounting Dream offers competitive pricing but often falters in terms of build quality for larger TVs. What HOME VISION excels at is balancing simplicity, durability, and affordability, delivering precisely what most users in need of a fixed mount would want. However, if adjustability is non-negotiable for you, alternatives might suit you better.

**Value for Money**  
Given its robust design, array of included features, and undeniable strength, this wall mount offers incredible value for its cost. While there are cheaper options out there, they rarely hold up (literally!) to the standards this product meets. It‚Äôs not just a purchase; it‚Äôs an investment for anyone keen on enhancing their setup‚Äôs aesthetics and functionality. Whether you spend hours watching Netflix or want to impress guests with a cleaner space, this mount truly delivers.

1k7uagh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1k7uagh/should_you_buy_french_connection_fc36920ex675/,Should You Buy French Connection FC-36920-EX-675 Carry-On Luggage Review Today?,"The French Connection FC-36920-EX-675 Saint Martin Carry-On Luggage with Cup Holder and USB Ports in the Pink A Boo finish is undoubtedly a stylish and modern addition to the travel game. After several trips with this carry-on, I can confidently share both its merits and areas where it could improve. Here‚Äôs my firsthand experience using this suitcase, combined with insights from other users.

**STRIKING DESIGN MEETS FUNCTIONALITY**  
The first time I saw this carry-on, the sleek aesthetics immediately caught my eye. Its light and rosy pink hue, paired with a minimalist design, feels premium and fashionable. At 15.4 x 9 x 22 inches, it fits snugly into most airline overhead compartments. Despite its lightweight build of just 8.05 pounds, the suitcase manages to feel solid enough for general use. However, the off-white colors some users have tested seem to scuff pretty easily during handling, so if you‚Äôre particular about maintaining a pristine look, darker tones might be worth considering.

**PATENT-PENDING CONVENIENCE FEATURES**  
One of the standout highlights is its innovative 4-in-1 holder thoughtfully positioned on the backside. It effortlessly accommodates a phone, cup, USB, and USB-C ports. During airport layovers, I used the cup holder as a lifesaver for my morning coffee‚Äîand the USB-C port to charge my phone from a power bank tucked inside the suitcase‚Äôs dedicated pocket. While these features are innovative, opening the holder feels a bit flimsy and may require gentle use to avoid accidental damage. Still, it‚Äôs perfect for stationary setups, like while sitting at the boarding gate.

**EFFORTLESS MOBILITY**  
Gliding this suitcase through glossy airport floors and city streets is where it truly shines. Boasting a 360-degree, 8-wheel system, I felt like this bag was practically floating. Whether dashing through terminals or maneuvering tight spaces, its mobility is unparalleled. Multiple reviewers mentioned they could run across gates with ease, and I had the same experience‚Äîminimal drag and maximum stability. The top and side carry handles are wonderfully ergonomic for lifting, though a middle grab handle would be a welcomed addition. 

**ADAPTIVE STORAGE CAPACITY**  
The expandable packing capacity is another major plus. I managed to pack for a week-long getaway, all thanks to the extra storage space available when unzipped. The internal organization is simple. However, a downside is that there‚Äôs little-to-no padding on the inside, meaning you should take care when packing any delicate items. Wrapping valuables in clothing might be your safest bet. One user pointed out how the slight bulge in its exterior design limits internal storage‚Äîa valid concern for heavy packers.

**Boons**  
- Strong aesthetics with a trendy yet professional look.  
- Cup holder and USB ports provide rare, functional extras.  
- Exceptionally smooth 8-wheel rolling system.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- Cupholders might snap if too much weight or force is applied.  
- The scuff-prone exterior and lack of cushion inside could be impractical for some users.  
- Feels delicate for harsher handling environments, such as checked baggage.  

**DIRECT COMPETITORS**  
Comparing this suitcase to similar options such as Samsonite‚Äôs Omni PC Hardside and Away‚Äôs Carry-On, the French Connection version certainly holds its own. Samsonite‚Äôs cases typically offer tougher durability with scratch-resistant exteriors, but they lack the charming aesthetic and innovative convenience features like cup holders. On the other hand, Away‚Äôs Carry-On edges out on interior organization and power bank integration, but it doesn‚Äôt come close to French Connection‚Äôs stellar wheel system. This carry-on is undeniably tailored for travelers seeking compact convenience with a touch of flair while prioritizing mobility over ruggedness.

**SMART SPENDING**  
Considering the provided features, this is an excellent middle-ground option for casual travelers. Those flying once or twice annually and seeking lightweight, easy-to-maneuver luggage will deeply appreciate what this product brings to the table. It‚Äôs worth noting that while there are sturdier models in the market, such as Samsonite‚Äôs offerings, they may not provide the same level of fashionable design or convenience perks within this pricing range.

Before I start it‚Äôs important to state that I am also black. (Father is black, mother is Puerto Rican)

We all have an employee or coworker who is outspoken and says what she thinks and blames it on having a ‚Äúsassy‚Äù or ‚Äúblunt‚Äù personality, mine is Candace. The ‚Äúspeak first and if you don‚Äôt like what I gotta say then that‚Äôs your problem‚Äù headspace but she is good at her job and I never have to ask her twice to so anything. Generally as her manager I don‚Äôt really mind if since I grew up with it in my background and I know she isn‚Äôt being malicious and most of the employees enjoy her personality who happen to also be black but some of the other employees who aren‚Äôt black see her as rude, loud and arrogant. But she‚Äôs really good at what she does in her work. 

One of my other employees (Bridget) came to me and complained bc Candace spoke and has been saying random things in convo that‚Äôs offensive to her and a few others. Ex: telling the white employees she‚Äôs ‚Äúgonna avoid their food at the company potluck bc they probably make food as unseasoned and white as their skin and culture‚Äù ‚Ä¶and if the topic of racial events on the news come up she‚Äôll tell the white employees that they‚Äôre opinions aren‚Äôt valid bc oppressors they‚Äôre white privilege isn‚Äôt welcome here. 

I spoke to Candace a few times and told her that that‚Äôs not appropriate and she needs to chill. She said she‚Äôs just blunt and my response is ‚Äúblunt isn‚Äôt a personality‚Äù. She understood and thing went silent for a few months 

Well the Shannon Sharpe issue came up and I was in the break room getting coffee when I overheard Mandy who walked in (who happens to be white) saying that she heard about it on fb and it‚Äôs a shame another celebrity is getting into trouble. 

Candice replied and says ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs what black men get for dealing with you white disasters‚Äù

I was in shock and before I could say anything Mandy said ‚ÄúI have mixed sons. I understand the dangers for my half black sons and I‚Äôm allowed to express my concerns‚Äù

Candice yells back ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt get to have an opinion, you may have laid up with a black man but obviously since there‚Äôs no ring on your finger you‚Äôre just like the white girl he was messing with and the downfall of another black man who will die by the hands of a White woman‚Äù

Mandy burst into tears and left. (Mandy‚Äôs husband died 2 years ago in a car accident. Mandy was driving and the car was t boned and her husband apparently died instantly-Candice doesn‚Äôt know that)

Right then and there in the break room in front of everyone I told Candice she‚Äôs fired and to get her stuff and go. Racism isn‚Äôt tolerated. Her response was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm black, we can‚Äôt be racist. She‚Äôs just being soft‚Äù. I told her I don‚Äôt care what she thinks she needs to go now. Some of my employees think I over reacted but I spoke to her 2 times prior. Things were going great for almost year when I spoke to her and it just erupted

1k7ua6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1k7ua6y/does_jabra_elite_5_earbuds_offer_the_best_noise/,Does Jabra Elite 5 Earbuds Offer the Best Noise Cancellation? Review Inside,"The Jabra 100-99181704-98 Elite 5 True Wireless Earbuds definitely caught my attention. As someone who‚Äôs perpetually surrounded by gadgets, these earbuds promised to deliver cutting-edge features in a compact design. Over the past weeks, I‚Äôve used them for everything from long work calls to endless Spotify sessions. Here‚Äôs my take on their performance.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, these earbuds felt solid. Compact and lightweight, their black finish gave off a sleek but understated vibe. The ergonomic fit was noteworthy; even with extended use, they didn‚Äôt feel intrusive or uncomfortable. The inclusion of three EarGel sizes was a bless-your-heart moment‚ÄîI actually found a snug fit without fussing for hours. Although they‚Äôre made of plastic, the durability seems reliable. It helps that these are IP55-rated, meaning they‚Äôre resistant to both dust and splashes. I might‚Äôve splashed coffee on them (oops), but they emerged unscathed.  

**Audio and Noise Cancellation Features**  
Let‚Äôs talk sound‚ÄîI‚Äôm a bit of an audiophile, and the 6mm speakers here didn‚Äôt disappoint. With the customizable equalizer within the Jabra Sound+ app, I could tweak the bass and treble to my liking. Spotify never sounded this sharp; the aptX codecs played a big role in delivering clearer, punchier audio. The Hybrid ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) worked well to cut out background chatter, though I wouldn‚Äôt call it perfect. It‚Äôs good enough to drown out the office drama but won't make you oblivious during a fire alarm. The HearThrough feature, on the other hand, activated when I needed to stay aware of my surroundings, such as hearing my dog bark while I worked quietly.

**Call Quality and Microphone Performance**  
Six microphones sounded like overkill initially, but they genuinely shined during calls. The external mics stayed active, ensuring clarity during normal conversations, while the internal mics tackled wind noise when I was pacing on my balcony. Callers could hear me even when the weather got breezy, which rarely happens with most earbuds. These are easily a go-to for anyone constantly on Zoom calls or taking business calls while outdoors.  

**Battery Performance**  
Battery life is always a dealbreaker for me, but these earbuds held up surprisingly well. You‚Äôre looking at around 7 hours on a full charge, and the Qi-certified charging case bumped it up to about 28 hours. I appreciated the quick-charge function‚Äîafter just 10 minutes, I could get an hour of playback, which saved me more than once. The Mono Mode option was interesting too; it allowed me to use one earbud while charging the other, which I found useful during long workdays.  

**Connectivity and Digital Assistants**  
Dual device pairing via Bluetooth Multipoint made multitasking seamless‚Äîsimultaneously connected to my laptop for meetings and phone for music streaming. Setup was quick, thanks to Google Fast Pair for my Android device. Speaking to Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant for hands-free help felt smooth, assuming my voice didn‚Äôt confuse them with the occasional stutter.  

**Positives**  
- Compact, ergonomic design that prioritizes comfort.  
- Reliable Hybrid ANC and HearThrough technology for multiple sound scenarios.  
- Fantastic audio output, customizable via the Jabra Sound+ app for optimal clarity.  
- Strong battery support, complimented by quick charging.  
- Seamless Bluetooth Multipoint connectivity for multitasking.  

**Critiques**  
- ANC, while decent, won‚Äôt match high-end models like Bose or Sony earbuds.  
- Plastic build feels a notch below premium for the price range.  
- Customization within the app requires some trial and error to nail your perfect sound profile.  

**Product Rivals**  
When stacked against competitors like the Apple AirPods Pro and Sony WF-1000XM4, the Jabra Elite 5 holds its ground but has a few challenges in matching certain premium features. Apple‚Äôs AirPods Pro wins when it comes to integration with iOS devices, offering smoother pairing and slightly more refined noise cancellation. It‚Äôs no secret Apple‚Äôs spatial audio attracts a ton of fans, though their earbuds are pricier. Meanwhile, Sony‚Äôs WF-1000XM4 delivers stronger ANC and arguably richer sound quality, despite being bulkier and less comfortable to wear over time. Jabra‚Äôs edge really shines in its affordability, extended battery life, and better durability, thanks to its water-resistance rating.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the feature set and durability, the pricing felt justifiable. While not the cheapest, these earbuds strike a good balance between cost and performance. They‚Äôre perfect for someone seeking high-quality sound, reliable call clarity, and a comfortable fit without blowing a paycheck. Definitely worth considering if you‚Äôre budget-conscious but unwilling to compromise too much on audio features.

I decided to get a Bambino plus - I still need a grinder and will get the Sage <**Sage Pro‚Ñ¢>** grinder I think but for now, I need a deep breath and enjoy this new machine - its used and I just realised it does not have the following accessories - how much of a problem will this be? and can anyone suggest some where to get anything I do need... 

Manual,  
Steam Wand Tip Cleaning Tool,  
Espresso Cleaning Tablets,  
Cleaning Disc,  
Water Filter,  
The Razor,  
Min/Max Milk Jug,  
Descaling Powder,  
2x Single Wall Filter Baskets

I was going to get an All in one Sage Barista but reading the downsides of the grinder put me off...

I should hope this new Sage Bambino will make better coffee than the 20 odd year old Gaggia? I did find that made very nice coffee but it also wasted quite a lot of grounds and with its age it was not feasible to keep any longer.

  
Appreciate any advice on the accessories!

It seemed an incredible price for a recent harvest of such a great tea. I had previously tried the version from Curious Tea (from 2024), and it is the best green tea I've tasted: buttery, vegetal, charred nut flavour, huge umami, so assumed that an even fresher version could only be better. The Lu Shan Yun Wu from Yunnan Sourcing, while nice, is much more mediocre (and I can only get around 2 worthwhile brews out of,2g:50ml, whereas I got about 8 out of the other one).   
  
Is the issue the harvest this year, or the travelability of green teas from Yunnan Sourcing?  
  
As I've got larger quantities of very highly reviewed black teas from them: Yi Mei Ren Wu Liang Mountain Yunnan (2025), Ning'er ""Golden Honey Aroma"" Yunnan (2025) and Premium Grade AA Jin Jun Mei Fujian Black (2024). Are these more likely to meet my expectations, and I should avoid green teas from here?

We were together for over a year and shared a deep connection, similar values, and genuine love. But toward the end of our relationship, we struggled‚Äîespecially around emotional safety and conflict. I have a history of emotional numbness and defensiveness from childhood trauma, and during fights, I often shut down. She‚Äôs more anxious in conflict, so we fell into a tough pursue-withdraw cycle that neither of us fully knew how to navigate.

Another hard part was that I expressed at one point that I was struggling with attraction. I now realize that my attraction is deeply tied to emotional connection, and when we were stuck in a negative loop, it clouded how I saw her. She didn‚Äôt feel chosen or good enough‚Äîand I deeply regret how I made her feel.

Tori broke up with me about two weeks ago. On April 20th, which was her birthday, we had a long and beautiful conversation. I sent her a heartfelt message about how much I love her and how much she means to me. We both expressed that we still love each other very much. She told me that a big part of her still sees a future with me, but that she needs space and time to find herself again‚Äîto become ‚Äúhappy Tori‚Äù without relying on a relationship to feel whole.

Since the breakup, I‚Äôve been honoring that space. I‚Äôve been working hard on myself‚Äîdoing neurofeedback, starting trauma and IFS parts work, and reflecting on the patterns I want to change. I know I contributed to the emotional misattunement in our relationship, and I‚Äôm committed to healing that. I don‚Äôt want to get back together unless we‚Äôre both in a much healthier, more secure place.

She‚Äôs currently on a trip to Europe with her friend, and I haven‚Äôt contacted her at all while she‚Äôs been away. But I‚Äôve been thinking about her a lot. I want to send her a simple message when she gets back‚Äîsomething like:

‚ÄúHey, I hope your trip was amazing. I‚Äôve been thinking of you and just wanted to send that your way.‚Äù

My question is:
Would sending that message be violating the space she asked for? Or would it be okay since it‚Äôs light, non-pushy, and from a calm, grounded place‚Äînot a plea or a bid to fix things?

Also:
Would it be appropriate to reach out about a month from now to ask her to get coffee‚Äînot to convince her of anything, but to genuinely share the work I‚Äôve been doing and give her space to reflect, too?",1,1745610920.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

(Father is black, mother is Puerto Rican)

We all have an employee or coworker who is outspoken and says what she thinks and blames it on having a ‚Äúsassy‚Äù or ‚Äúblunt‚Äù personality, mine is Candace. The ‚Äúspeak first and if you don‚Äôt like what I gotta say then that‚Äôs your problem‚Äù headspace but she is good at her job and I never have to ask her twice to so anything. Generally as her manager I don‚Äôt really mind if since I grew up with it in my background and I know she isn‚Äôt being malicious and most of the employees enjoy her personality who happen to also be black but some of the other employees who aren‚Äôt black see her as rude, loud and arrogant. But she‚Äôs really good at what she does in her work. 

One of my other employees (Bridget) came to me and complained bc Candace spoke and has been saying random things in convo that‚Äôs offensive to her and a few others. Ex: telling the white employees she‚Äôs ‚Äúgonna avoid their food at the company potluck bc they probably make food as unseasoned and white as their skin and culture‚Äù ‚Ä¶and if the topic of racial events on the news come up she‚Äôll tell the white employees that they‚Äôre opinions aren‚Äôt valid bc oppressors they‚Äôre white privilege isn‚Äôt welcome here. 

I spoke to Candace a few times and told her that that‚Äôs not appropriate and she needs to chill. She said she‚Äôs just blunt and my response is ‚Äúblunt isn‚Äôt a personality‚Äù. She understood and thing went silent for a few months 

Well the Shannon Sharpe issue came up and I was in the break room getting coffee when I overheard Mandy who walked in (who happens to be white) saying that she heard about it on fb and it‚Äôs a shame another celebrity is getting into trouble. 

Candice replied and says ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs what black men get for dealing with you white disasters‚Äù

I was in shock and before I could say anything Mandy said ‚ÄúI have mixed sons. I understand the dangers for my half black sons and I‚Äôm allowed to express my concerns‚Äù

Candice yells back ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt get to have an opinion, you may have laid up with a black man but obviously since there‚Äôs no ring on your finger you‚Äôre just like the white girl he was messing with and the downfall of another black man who will die by the hands of a White woman‚Äù

Mandy burst into tears and left. (Mandy‚Äôs husband died 2 years ago in a car accident. Mandy was driving and the car was t boned and her husband apparently died instantly-Candice doesn‚Äôt know that)

Right then and there in the break room in front of everyone I told Candice she‚Äôs fired and to get her stuff and go. Racism isn‚Äôt tolerated. Her response was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm black, we can‚Äôt be racist. She‚Äôs just being soft‚Äù. I told her I don‚Äôt care what she thinks she needs to go now. Some of my employees think I over reacted but I spoke to her 2 times prior. Things were going great for almost year when I spoke to her and it just erupted

Certainly, Michael! Here's a refined and consistent version of the Noor hair regrowth formula description:

---

**Noor Wonder Growth Spray: 9-in-1 SuperBoost Blend**  
This advanced formula combines key natural ingredients designed to nourish the scalp, combat hair loss, and promote healthy hair growth:

- **Green Coffee Bean Extract (4:1)**: Imported from Egypt, this extract combats follicle fatigue, inhibits a key enzyme responsible for hair loss by 67%, and supports the transition of hair follicles into the growing phase.  
- **Argan Oil**: Packed with Vitamin E and squalene, it hydrates, removes scalp buildup, soothes irritation, and strengthens hair strands.  
- **Rosemary Oil Oleoresin Extract**: Rich in carnosic acid, it stimulates tissue repair and enhances scalp blood flow, promoting hair growth.  
- **Biotin (1% Powder)**: An essential nutrient that strengthens hair and counters thinning or hair loss.  
- **Cynatine Keratin**: A natural keratin protein clinically shown to reduce hair loss by up to 47% while fortifying hair from within.  
- **Peppermint Oil (Indian Piperita)**: Soothes the scalp and may stimulate hair follicles for enhanced growth.  
- **Castor Oil**: Contains omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids that strengthen hair roots, reducing breakage.  
- **Rice Bran Oil**: A potent antioxidant that nourishes, moisturizes, and protects hair against damage.  
- **MCT Oil (Derived from Palm)**: Provides essential nourishment and promotes overall scalp health.  

**Important Note**: There are conflicting reports regarding the inclusion of dimethicone, a synthetic silicone, in this formula. While Noor's official website does not list dimethicone, some online product descriptions mention it. Noor's customer service has reportedly denied its presence. However, if you are sensitive to silicones or concerned about potential scalp buildup, it is advisable to verify this directly with Noor.  

Noor claims the formula is free of harmful chemicals, including parabens, sulfates, and fragrances, and is safe for all hair types. Be sure to check the product label for the most current and accurate ingredient list, as formulations may vary over time.

Did you set boundaries? Were you able to come to an agreement for all?","For context my (29f) MIL (60f) was always overstepping boundaries with the relationship I have with my husband. She often would try encouraging him to lie to me, and also encouraged him to seek other women if he wanted. My husband did not do this and would come and talk with me about it. He also told me when we first got together she ""approved,"" of me as I had child bearing hips. 

I got pregnant with our son in 2022 and gave birth in 2023. While I was pregnant I told her I only wanted my husband in the room and she threw hot coffee on me. She later told my husband he must convince me to let her in the room while I give birth.

After we had him I thought she might calm down some as I figured she was just excited. However it got worse somehow. She was calling herself mama to our baby, vaping/smoking while holding him, knows she cannot walk well and would do it with baby in arms even though my husband asked her not to which led to her falling while holding baby, talked trash and lied about me to her whole family when my husband tried setting boundaries, and also made a burner account on Instagram where she was harrasing me (I showed my husband immediately and it was obvious it was hers as it had a pic of her dog for the main photo). She also yelled at me because when my husband came home from therapy (she was staying with us at this time) she kept asking what was discussed during it and he finally told her that he was thinking about reconnecting with his dad (her exhusband) and she yelled at me for it saying I must have been the driver behind this choice. This continued for a year after my sons birth as I felt it was my husband's relationship and I didn't want to come inbetween it. However he ended up having enough and went completely NC with her for now. 

While I appreciate my husband doing this as it has saved me a lot of stressed out situations, part of me still feels bad about it all. I am pregnant with our second baby now (32 weeks) and he does not want his mom to ever meet our child. 

I asked if he wanted to try talking with her and he said no as the last time he tried talking with her about everything that transpired she denied it and immediately started crying when he was able to site sources/events. She tells him it is all my fault and I should just let her do what she wants when it comes to our kids, but my husband and I both disagree on this as they are our kids. 

Long story short, I wanted to see if I could see this more from a husband's POV. I also wanted to see if anyone else has gone through a similar issue? TIA ‚ù§Ô∏è",0,1745610164.0,AskMenAdvice,7,0.5,False

But in¬†*Atomic Habits*, James Clear shows us the opposite:

>

This book isn‚Äôt about intensity.  
It‚Äôs about¬†*consistency*.

It‚Äôs about the small, often invisible actions we repeat every day ‚Äî the ones that quietly shape our identity and eventually determine our results.

Here‚Äôs what makes¬†*Atomic Habits*¬†such a powerful, practical read ‚Äî and how you can use its core ideas to upgrade your habits, mindset, and performance starting now.

# üí° The Core Idea: Habits Are the Compound Interest of Self-Improvement

Just like money compounds over time, so does your effort.

* **1% better each day**¬†for a year makes you 37x better.
* **1% worse each day**¬†makes you close to zero.

The problem? Small improvements are hard to notice.  
So are small declines.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs easy to ignore them ‚Äî and that‚Äôs exactly why they matter.

# üîÑ The Habit Loop: How All Habits Work

Every habit follows a¬†**cue ‚Üí craving ‚Üí response ‚Üí reward**¬†loop.

Example:

* **Cue:**¬†You get a notification.
* **Craving:**¬†You want to feel connected.
* **Response:**¬†You check Instagram.
* **Reward:**¬†You feel a little dopamine hit.

Habits aren‚Äôt random ‚Äî they‚Äôre your brain‚Äôs way of solving problems on autopilot. Once you understand the loop, you can start to design better ones.

# üéØ Identity-Based Habits: Who Before What

Most people build habits based on¬†*outcomes*:

>

James Clear flips that:

>

Ask yourself:  
üëâ¬†*‚ÄúWhat would a healthy person do right now?‚Äù*  
üëâ¬†*‚ÄúWhat would a focused writer do right now?‚Äù*

Every time you act in alignment with your desired identity, you cast a vote for the person you want to become.

# üß† The 4 Laws of Behavior Change (and How to Use Them)

Here‚Äôs the science-backed formula James Clear lays out for building¬†*good*¬†habits ‚Äî and breaking¬†*bad*¬†ones:

# ‚úÖ 1. Make It Obvious

**(Cue)**

* Design your environment so the habit is right in front of you.
* Want to eat better? Put fruit on the counter.
* Want to journal? Leave your notebook on your pillow.

>

# ‚úÖ 2. Make It Attractive

**(Craving)**

* Bundle your habit with something you enjoy.
* *‚ÄúI‚Äôll do 10 pushups while I listen to a podcast I love.‚Äù*
* Make the habit part of a community or culture you admire.

# ‚úÖ 3. Make It Easy

**(Response)**

* Reduce friction. Make it so simple, it‚Äôs hard¬†*not*¬†to do.
* Start with 2 minutes. Want to meditate? Just sit for 2 minutes.
* Use the¬†**two-minute rule**: Make it stupid easy to start.

# ‚úÖ 4. Make It Satisfying

**(Reward)**

* Give yourself a small win.
* Track your streak.
* Celebrate the effort, not the outcome.

We repeat what feels good. Make it rewarding¬†*now*, not just later.

# üß® Bonus: How to Break a Bad Habit

Just invert the laws:

* Make it¬†**invisible**¬†(hide cues)
* Make it¬†**unattractive**¬†(reframe the craving)
* Make it¬†**difficult**¬†(add friction)
* Make it¬†**unsatisfying**¬†(track consequences)

>

# üìà The Power of Systems Over Goals

Clear makes one of the most important mindset shifts:

>

Goals are useful for direction.  
Systems are what keep you going.

Goals = outcome.  
Systems = process.

# üîÅ What Makes a Habit¬†Stick?

* **Repetition > Motivation.** Motivation gets you going. Repetition builds the groove.
* **Track It.** What you measure, you manage. Even a simple habit tracker can reinforce progress.
* **Don‚Äôt break the chain.** Miss one day? Fine. Miss two? Risk the habit collapsing.
* **Tie habits to identity.** The goal isn‚Äôt to run a marathon. The goal is to become¬†*a runner.*

# üí¨ Final Takeaways

* Start small. Really small. Shrink the habit until it‚Äôs effortless to begin.
* Build your identity around your habits. Let actions shape belief.
* Don‚Äôt focus on overnight success ‚Äî focus on¬†*never missing twice*.
* Stack your habits into existing routines (after coffee, I‚Äôll stretch).
* Design your space like it matters ‚Äî because it does.

# üß† Remember:

Your habits are a mirror of who you believe you are.  
Change the habit ‚Äî change the identity.  
Change the identity ‚Äî change the life.

**2. Single-Origin Coffees:**

*   **Benefits:** Single-origin coffees, sourced from a single farm, region, or cooperative, offer a unique and distinct flavor profile that reflects the specific terroir and growing conditions of that location.*   **Ideal For:** Coffee shops and restaurants that want to showcase the unique characteristics of different coffee-growing regions and provide a more immersive coffee experience for their customers.
*   **Considerations:** Single-origin coffees can be more challenging to source consistently and may require more specialized roasting and brewing techniques to bring out their full potential. They are more specialized than astoria coffee beans.

*   **Ideal For:** Businesses that prioritize ethical sourcing and want to support sustainable coffee practices.

*   **Benefits:** Partnering with local and regional roasters allows businesses to support their local economy, source fresh coffee beans, and build relationships with coffee experts.
*   **Ideal For:** Businesses that want to support their local community and offer unique coffee blends that are not available from national distributors.
*   **considerations:** Local and regional roasters may have limited production capacity and may not be able to meet the needs of large-scale businesses. Though, they can be a great option for smaller cafes and restaurants.

## Making the Right Choice for Your Business

Choosing the right coffee solution requires careful consideration of your business needs, budget, and target audience. The Astoria Blend remains a viable option for businesses that prioritize consistency, affordability, and convenience. Though, for those seeking superior quality, unique flavor profiles, or specialized benefits, several compelling alternatives exist. By carefully evaluating these alternatives and considering your specific business goals, you can find the perfect coffee solution to enhance your offerings and satisfy your customers. bulk coffee beans from a less popular supplier may be more economical.

**Here‚Äôs a segment-by-segment breakdown on what to look for in a great coffee:**

**Coffee Shop Owners/Managers:**

*   **Key Priorities:** High-quality espresso, consistent flavor for repeat customers, attractive pricing to maintain profitability, and a compelling backstory (if offering specialty coffee). Should focus on buying astoria blend to have consistent product.
*   **Questions to Ask:** Can this blend hold up to milk-based drinks? Is it easy to dial in for espresso? What kind of support dose the supplier offer (training, equipment)?
*   **Decision Factors:** Taste tests, cost per pound, supplier reputation, and customer feedback are all critical. Finding the best commercial coffee blends can take time.**Restaurant owners/Managers:**

*   **Key Priorities:** Versatility (good for both espresso and drip), ease of brewing and minimal training required for staff, consistent availability, and cost-effectiveness.The blend needs to be for high volume use.
*   **Questions to Ask:** How does this coffee hold up being brewed in large batches? What level of training is required for our staff? What is the shelf life?
*   **Decision Factors:** Taste tests, cost per serving, ease of use, and supplier reliability are essential.

**office Managers/Purchasing Agents:**

*   **Key Priorities:** Affordability, broad appeal to a diverse group of employees, ease of ordering and delivery, and minimal maintenance required for brewing equipment. Ordering bulk coffee for office becomes even more affordable.*   **Questions to Ask:** What is the cost per cup? What is the minimum order size? Can the coffee be delivered regularly?
*   **Decision Factors:** Price, convenience, and employee feedback are key considerations.

**Distributors/Wholesalers:**

*   **Key Priorities:** Profitability, strong brand recognition (or potential for building a brand), reliable supply chain, and positive reviews from end-users.
*   **Questions to Ask:** What is the wholesale price? Is there marketing support available? What is the return policy? Distributors wanted for popular blends are sought after.*   **Decision Factors:** Profit margin, market demand, and supplier reputation are paramount.

## Beyond the Bean: Factors Influencing Coffee Quality

Selecting the right coffee blend is just one piece of the puzzle. Several other factors significantly influence the final cup of coffee:

*   **Water Quality:** Using filtered water is essential for brewing excellent coffee. Minerals and chemicals in tap water can negatively affect the taste. So don't skimp out on a filter.
*   **Grind Size:** Choosing the correct grind size for your brewing method is crucial. Too fine, and the coffee will be bitter; too coarse, and it will be weak.*   **Brewing Temperature:** Brewing coffee at the correct temperature (ideally between 195-205¬∞F) extracts the optimal flavors from the beans.
*   **Equipment Maintenance:** Regularly cleaning and maintaining your coffee brewing equipment is essential for ensuring consistent performance and preventing bitter or off-flavors.
*   **Storage:** Store coffee beans in an airtight container in a cool,dark place to preserve freshness and prevent oxidation.[[Explore Top rated astoria blend on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=astoria blend)

*   **Sustainability:** Consumers are increasingly demanding sustainably sourced coffee beans.
*   **Specialty Coffee:** The demand for high-quality,single-origin,and direct trade coffees continues to grow.
*   **Cold Brew:** Cold brew continues to surge in popularity, especially during warmer months.
*   **Nitro Coffee:** Nitro coffee, infused with nitrogen gas, offers a creamy and smooth texture.

## conclusion: Is the Astoria Blend Still the ""Best""?

The answer to the question of whether the Astoria Blend is still the ""best"" is nuanced and depends entirely on your specific business needs and priorities. It remains a solid and reliable option for businesses prioritizing consistency, affordability, and ease of use. However, businesses seeking unique flavor profiles, specialty-grade beans, or ethically sourced options must explore the alternatives. The Astoria blend may not be the best option for all situations. By carefully evaluating your needs and preferences, you can make an informed decision and choose the coffee solution that best aligns with your business goals and brand identity. Irrespective of what you choose,ensure the customer,that the customer gets to experience consistent coffee blend every single time.

1k7tu55,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k7tu55/explore_the_jura_e8_espresso_machine_review_is_it/,Explore the Jura E8 Espresso Machine Review Is It the Best Choice?,"The Jura 7610917152711 E8 Automatic Espresso Machine found itself gracing my countertop not long ago, and after weeks of caffeinated delight and experimentation, I feel armed to share my experience. As someone who spends a good chunk of mornings brewing espresso-based drinks, this machine promised to deliver a seamless, barista-style coffee experience right at home. While it truly earns its stripes in numerous areas, there are a few points worth considering before investing.

**Style and Build Quality**

The aesthetic appeal of the Jura E8 stands out immediately. The chrome finish combined with the modern design brings elegance to any kitchen space. Its dimensions‚Äî17""D x 20.2""W x 12.8""H‚Äîmake it a commanding presence on the counter without overwhelming the area. I especially loved the grooved design on the water tank and the sturdy chrome-plated cup grille, which effortlessly blends form with function. It‚Äôs clear Jura put emphasis on both performance and quality craftsmanship. However, the overall weight surprised me‚Äîit‚Äôs far lighter than it looks. While that increases portability, it also makes me question long-term durability if handled roughly. 

**Ease of Use**

Mornings can be chaotic, but this fully programmable machine simplifies everything. The 2.8-inch color display is intuitive, and navigating through coffee options and maintenance prompts feels natural. The machine can even adapt product names on its settings screen to match your preference and hide products you don‚Äôt often use. Artificial intelligence seems like such a buzzword, but in this context, it‚Äôs surprisingly helpful. My teenage daughter had no questions brewing herself a flat white over the weekend. That said, some users might find the six-button interface a little overwhelming in the beginning.

**Check [Jura 7610917152711 E8] price on Amazon.**

**Coffee Variety and Flavor**

This machine is a treat for adventurous coffee drinkers like me who don‚Äôt stick to just one thing. With 17 programmed specialties, it covers everything from espresso doppio to flat white. Over the weeks, I‚Äôve prepared macchiatos for my dad, cortados when friends visited, and even plain Americanos for my coworker who prefers straightforward coffee. The Professional Aroma Grinder is no joke‚Äî12.2% more aroma isn‚Äôt just a number; it‚Äôs something you truly taste with every cup. My partner noted the difference when compared to our older machine. The Pulse Extraction Process (P.E.P.) guarantees a burst of flavor, especially for short coffee beverages. However, darker roasts with more oil seem to cause clogs‚Äîa problem I‚Äôd previously encountered with another Jura model.

**Maintenance and Operating Costs**

Ah, the bittersweet truth about owning a premium coffee machine. Daily upkeep is required, with milk cleaning, descaling, and filter replacement being unavoidable tasks. What caught me off guard was the pace at which the system demands these replacements. The filters work excellently‚Äîno complaints there‚Äîbut the expense adds up over time. I tried a third-party filter at one point and regretted it due to leaks. Stick to Jura‚Äôs original filters if you venture into buying this model. The cleaning prompts ensure ultimate hygiene, a definite plus for those fussed about cleanliness like myself. Just know, regular cleaning will not only add to operating costs but also require a consistent effort.

**Strengths**

- High-quality design that enhances any kitchen d√©cor.  
- 17 beverage choices catering to diverse coffee preferences.  
- Professional Aroma Grinder delivering consistent grind quality.  
- Simple operation via a 2.8-inch display with AI capabilities.  

**Adverse Aspects**

- Maintenance costs are high with filters and cleaning solutions.  
- Not compatible with oily coffee beans; clogs may occur.  
- A bit lightweight, possibly questioning build durability.  

**Performance vs. Competitors**

When stacked up against its peers, like Miele or DeLonghi super-automatic options, the Jura E8 delivers a noticeably smoother coffee taste, partly thanks to the Pulse Extraction Process. My brother owns a Miele espresso maker, and after side-by-side testing during a family gathering, the Jura impressed everyone with its creamy froth and flavor consistency. However, Jura‚Äôs maintenance costs are significantly higher than Miele‚Äôs tablets and filters. Compared to DeLonghi, the Jura takes a more intuitive and advanced approach with its color screen and AI functions, though DeLonghi machines often present better value for money.

**Smart Spending**

This espresso machine leans toward the premium price point, and with good reason‚Äîit‚Äôs contenders are other high-end machines and not budget models. If you value variety in your coffee drinks, ease of operation, and consistent quality, it certainly packs a punch for the price. Balancing that, you do need to account for ongoing costs. That morning latte prepared within minutes might be worth it to you. The machine pays for itself quickly depending on how much you'd otherwise spend at coffee shops.

Nothing more.  They are any good or terrible.   There are good ones, and there are bad ones.   But calling yourself one is a bit pretentious because you're not.. unless you are.  And furthermore, from a personal viewpoint, I find such professionals usually too busy to care about details.  Certainly not the level of attention that most home espresso enthusiasts put into our drinks.

Generally speaking, I'd say for every 100 working barista, there's probably 1 or 2 that are at the same level as a home enthusiast.  It's a bit like comparing an audio equipment sales person to an audiophile. They are not the same.  You are doing yourself a disservice by thinking of yourself as a barista.

Truth is, he used me to be his friend, whom he drunk texts when needed, vents when needed, and me? Well, there is nothing to me.

I had an accident and told him about it (after not talking to him for about a month. The reason was, I was in his city and asked if he wanted to meet - of course he NEVER responded.

I confronted him, all these days. When he was drunk, he told me he cares about me. Sober? He replied me with a word or two. Today, he told me ‚Äúyou are not idiot. I am‚Äù. I felt anxious during my whole Easter break, cried the whole day yesterday and I now realize, after all, he will never change.",2,1745609191.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

He says I apparently do it on purpose. He says all men don‚Äôt like to be interrupted and all men get angry like this and that if we break up there‚Äôs no way I can find someone else and I‚Äôll realise that all men are worse than him. I just want advice.

To me - I‚Äôm trying to be involved in the conversation. Or sometimes if I bring something up he has a huge reaction. Or if I do something wrong. I find myself not bringing things up to him in fear of him yelling or swearing

We have children together and he says I‚Äôll ruin the family if we break up. But I don‚Äôt want to hurt the kids by staying together either. we‚Äôve been together for so long that sometimes it feels like we‚Äôre soulmates but I know it‚Äôs not right to be yelled at. I don‚Äôt like feeling like this but I also know I‚Äôm not perfect and I can also be quite toxic back to him. 

He‚Äôs called me a cunt, a bitch, a piece of shit. But when I tell him that that is abuse - all he just says is ‚Äúyou swear too‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre acting like you‚Äôre perfect, you‚Äôre the problem too‚Äù 
Like yea maybe I am, but I never swear and yell at him for doing something a way I don‚Äôt like it. I know I‚Äôm not perfect. But how can I be when I‚Äôm getting sworn at. It feels like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells. He tells me he will be the angriest person if I leave him and no man is better than him. 

He makes food and helps with the kids and is 80% of the time a great father and makes me coffee so he uses all of that to say how he‚Äôs so amazing and does so much and no guys are like him. It‚Äôs hard because I‚Äôm pretty much reliant on him but I feel it in my gut that we need to break up. It‚Äôs also hard because he feels like ‚Äúthe one‚Äù sometimes, we have great banter and humour. We broke up before when I was 1 year postpartum with my first and now I‚Äôm almost a year postpartum with my second and he promised he would change and nothing has. I have no family help but I have a beautiful friend community. Last time when we broke up he punched like six holes in the wall and absolutely lost it. 
Help, I want advice. I feel so sad and lost. Do I leave this man even though we‚Äôve been together for 5 years and have two kids, and are engaged??

1k7tils,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1k7tils/does_waterdrop_15ua_under_sink_water_filter/,Does Waterdrop 15UA Under Sink Water Filter Review Meet Your Expectations?,"The Waterdrop 15UA Under Sink Water Filter System stands out as one of those products I didn‚Äôt know I needed until I started using it. I've been testing this unit in my kitchen for the past month, and I have to say ‚Äì it's filled with both impressive features and a few minor hitches that are worth mentioning. If clean water is as essential to your daily routine as it is to mine, you might find this review helpful.

**Sleek and Compact Design**  
From the moment I unboxed this under-sink water filter, I immediately appreciated the compact design. It fits snugly under my kitchen sink without intruding on the limited real estate available down there. I liked the minimalistic design that effortlessly blended into my existing setup. This isn't one of those clunky gadgets that screams for attention; instead, it quietly gets the job done.  

**Service Lifespan That Stands Out**  
One major advantage of this water filter is its impressive service life. Designed to last up to two years or filter 19,000 gallons of water (provided you're using municipal water), it's incredibly low maintenance. I don't have to worry about constantly replacing the filter, saving not just time but also the hassle of keeping track of its usage. My mom, who has a knack for finding issues in every product, was also impressed when I explained this feature to her.  

[Check Waterdrop 15UA Under Sink Water Filter System price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0d6gck1t3/)  

**Twist-and-Lock Installation Makes It a Breeze**  
I‚Äôll admit it ‚Äì I'm not exactly the handiest person around. That‚Äôs why I loved the twist-and-lock installation system. It took me just a few seconds to connect everything without the need for any tools. I had even set aside an afternoon to tackle the installation, but it turned out to be so beginner-friendly that I had the system up and running in no time. For someone like me, who dreads setups and complicated manuals, this alone was a huge plus.  

**Multi-Stage Filtration for Cleaner Water**  
The filtration system is, of course, the core of this product. I ran several tests over the weeks using varying water recipes, and each time, the multi-stage filtration shone through. It did an admirable job filtering out heavy metals, sediment, and other pollutants from my municipal water supply. No more weird tastes in my tap water, and better yet, I've noticed my coffee and tea taste noticeably better. Who knew filtered water could elevate everyday drinks?  

**Positives**  
- Extended service life of up to two years with minimal effort.  
- Compact design that saves space while maintaining a sleek aesthetic.  
- Incredibly quick and tool-free installation process.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The system tends to perform slightly less effectively with well water rather than municipal water, based on my tests.  
- While the twist-and-lock mechanism is user-friendly, it takes some getting used to during the first installation.  
- It would be nice if the package included a replacement cartridge or extra components.

**Direct Competitors**  
I‚Äôve had experience with a few similar under-sink water filtration systems over the years. The main rival in my experience is the APEC Ultimate RO-Hi system, which offers reverse osmosis technology. While the APEC delivers outstanding water purity, it doesn‚Äôt fit compactly under my sink like this unit does. Plus, it requires more maintenance, which can be annoying if you‚Äôre juggling multiple appliances.  

On the other side, there's the iSpring RCC7AK system, which offers additional remineralization for naturally balanced water. While this is a cool feature, I found the maintenance costs to be slightly higher compared to this product. Ultimately, the Waterdrop filter nails the ease-of-use factor, whereas some competitors fall short in this department.  

**Smart Spending on Water Filtration**  
Given its shelf life, compact design, and efficient filtration system, the price-to-quality ratio sits at a sweet spot. While it might not be the absolute cheapest option in the market, what you‚Äôre getting in terms of longevity and convenience makes it totally worth it. Comparatively, systems that come with more advanced reverse osmosis or remineralization features can cost significantly more upfront and in maintenance. This filter balances affordability with functionality.

**INTRO :** Hi hello, I‚Äôm Sam! I‚Äôm a 29 year old (ancient, I know) who is at long last healed and content and very open to finding his lifelong person and partner. I‚Äôve been through a lot by this point, but I‚Äôve decided the struggle has been for a purpose, to singularly make me a kinder, more empathetic person, capable of caring for others and himself that much more purposefully. There will always be something that happens - I think now it‚Äôs how we choose to respond to it, as individuals and, hopefully, as a duo. If devotion and always having each others backs is your thing, read on\~

**WHERE YOU AT? :** Currently, I am in the US and, more specifically, the East Coast. That will likely not remain for much longer as I suss out what my next steps are, the major factors being grad school, careers, and *the collapse of the United States.*

**A RELATIONSHIP? ‚Äì \[YES\] :** To me, an ideal relationship isn‚Äôt just being in love or in lust or two best friends that eventually shrug and say ‚Äúyeah, might as well.‚Äù It‚Äôs *all* of those and so much more. You should be able to refer to each other as ‚Äúbabe, dude, lover‚Äù all interchangeably and mean each of them simultaneously. It is a conscious and continuous choice and commitment, that we‚Äôll choose one another each day over everything else, through struggles and anxiety, because this is what we have pledged to and that we will work and play together through the difficult and fun times alike. Very purposefully, my goal for dating is to create a lasting, life long partnership, where we will make our plans together, supporting and elevating each other towards our individual and shared dreams. Want to go back to school and become a lawyer? Suit up, I am making you breakfast each morning no matter how disgustingly early you get up, or at least packing you a homemade lunch the night before, we‚Äôre House Husbanding this if we need to for that kind of career. Are we starting a family? Doubly so, I will HOLD down this fort and get you whatever you need to make it through and I will get myself a cool robotic hand after you crush one of them in the delivery room. Not interested in that, that‚Äôs okay too, we will keep our passports up to date and travel whenever the chance presents itself, whether we‚Äôre running from a regime or just want to go see Mt. Fuji. We can make this whatever we want it to be, as long as it‚Äôs together and with belief in each other. That‚Äôs really what I‚Äôm looking for - something to last a lifetime and then past that so we can keep company in Elysium or, your preferred afterlife.

**WHAT HE‚ÄôS LOOKING FOR :** Well if I knew where to find you, I wouldn‚Äôt be scrawling this pamphlet! Truthfully, I don‚Äôt know what my ideal partner looks like or acts like, other than a few basic ideals like being : kind, intelligent, having integrity, loyal to us and your friends and family, altruistic, honest to others and to \*yourself, has passions and will share what matters to you with me so that I can appreciate it too.

Vibes wise - I find a huge swath of forms and styles attractive. It‚Äôs really about more who is inhabiting that person? It‚Äôs who that image *is* that is what matters to me, I would not be fooled by that doppelganger subplot or an evil twin for a fraction of a second. I am currently figuring out my own presentation, if I want to express slightly more feminine than just Bedraggled College Professor‚Ñ¢ energy I currently emanate, maybe we push it closer to Oh, That‚Äôs a Beautiful Hyrulian Warrior. As such, I welcome you in whatever style you like - I‚Äôm going to guess you‚Äôll be nuerospicy like I am and probably have some they/them to your she/her. Dresses, jeans, oversized hoodies, athletic wear, suit and tie - if you‚Äôre femme or androgynous or more masculine or cycle between all of them, *amazing.* Variety is the spice of life, right? Just be you, and arrive to the party healthy and healed and whimsical ‚Äì and also generally close to my age bracket, I think either 3-4 years on either side of me is okay (my rule is, if we could have been in the same four year college at the same time, we‚Äôre golden. We should be about equally developed as people and in the same chapters of our lives, if not the same page.)

**LIKES, HOBBIES, PASSIONS :** I will attempt, and fail, to be concise - I have been drawing since I could hold even vaguely hold a pencil. I was born the same year Pokemon came to the West so, there was a zero percent chance I was going to escape that formative interest. I love Pokemon and will be drawing them for you at some point or another, that‚Äôs just going to happen. I adore cats but all animals too and will happily point out whatever I see on any excursions we might get the chance to take - Yes I do hear a woodpecker, let‚Äôs go find it. I am a big fan of cooking, both on my own and with a trusted co-chef, and we would in time compile a family cookbook, if we make it that far along. I am big into animation, Adventure Time was hugely inspirational to me, and I‚Äôd love to learn Blender this year - the third Spiderverse film is currently my ‚Äúgotta stay alive until‚Äù to hype myself up when things seem grim. I‚Äôm also refusing to die until I see what the One Piece is, that‚Äôs a big one, and every new release of From Soft, the Pokemon Company, and a Monster Hunter title are a festival in this house. Martial arts and generally being active and exploring the natural world is special to me, as well as finding coffee houses we like. Let‚Äôs make our way through every gallery, museum, zoo, and aquarium there is to be had and keep a ledger of the ones we like the very best. I could and would and will keep going on, but I‚Äôll save that for after we‚Äôve started chatting - otherwise, I‚Äôm just blathering into the void as usual. I‚Äôm game for most everything, especially if it‚Äôs nerdy, that‚Äôs the tl;dr. I‚Äôve never been to a concert so, maybe we can solve that.

**CONSIDERATIONS :** I‚Äôve been through some serious stuff. I have suffered gun violence, s\*xual violence and emotional abuse, related addiction and recovery, manipulation, poverty, and sickness. I think, considering everything, I‚Äôve come out the other side pretty well. I‚Äôve done my therapy and growth and found my personal path forward. None of this comes into the relationship with me, but it‚Äôs worth knowing and handling with care. I will gladly do the very same with you <3

**CONCLUSION :** If you‚Äôve actually read through all of that - wow, alright then. Clearly I‚Äôm at least a little interesting, I‚Äôve resonated with you even just a bit. Send me a hello, tell me a little about yourself, let‚Äôs figure out if we have something here. The ‚Äúworst‚Äù that could happen is that you‚Äôll make a cool new friend (cool is subjective) - the best? We‚Äôll find out I suppose.  
  
That‚Äôs all for now, and what an all it was.   
  
Thank you and, take care out there.  
  
\-Sam

A glimpse of the past, or perhaps a look to the future 



""Grace of the first born"", 8 million lightyears outside the milkyway galaxy.  
06:30 Shipboard time  
Arbiter Selendis

Peaceful.  
It was always so peaceful within the void between galaxies.  
The perfect place to open one's mind and meditate on the nature of reality, of the differing states of matter, anti matter and energy.  
Or to reflect on the past, on mistakes, losses and victories.

To relearn old lessons was a painful process, so it falls to those like her, gifted with exceptional control to observe, to learn and to remember.  
Time crystalises around her as she wills it so, glimpses of the past playing out on the countless faces of the delicate crystal structure.

The moonlanding the humans were so proud of so long ago, the first atomic blast, the first airplane, The first steam engine.  
Scenes going all the way back to the first homo sapience to pick up a rock cover the crystal she made, a perfect recording of human history ripped from the very fabric of space and time itself.  
As she has done many times now arbiter Selendis opens her mind to the totality of a species history. Human history this time, experiencing a thousand lifetimes at once.

She's a hunter gatherer stalking a herd of mammoth during the last ice age just as she looses her footing and slides into a crack in the glacier.  
She's a simple farmer tending to his 2 cows and small field of wheat as another man clad in extremely simple clothes rips her throath open with a crude bow and arrow from the bushes at the edge of the tree line.  
She's a soldier under some long forgotten general in the early bronze age, storming some mesopatamian city gate as a heavy rock pushed off the city wall crushes her.

She's a Spartan with the 300 at thermopolea, shoulder to shoulder, shields locked together as the Persians flank their phalanx from a secret passage, the battle is long and drawn out but she dies as one of the last few standing.  
She's a legionary with the 9th legion of Rome as the dark forest swallows them whole, germanic tribesman ambushing the long marching column from both sides, it's over before a propper battle can begin.  
She's a roman Centurion now, this time powerless to stop the sacking of Rome as the many tribes overrun her men.

She's a viking, sailing with a hardy crew using the stars to navigate, only for the wind to whistle and howl as a sudden storm gathers above. The ship though rugged slips beneath the waves never to be seen again by human eyes.  
She's a levy in some lords army, holding a somewhat crudely made spear, the other levy spearman panic and run as the thunder of a thousand hooves striking the ground echoes through the desert valley, a man atop an armored horse clad in white robes decapitates her in a single clean strike as he rides past her.  
She's a knight on horseback now, clad in finely made metal armor as she and her fellow Knights charge at the English, only to end up stuck in the mud, sitting ducks for the English longbows.  
Shes a sergeant now. Ordered to deal with a peasant revolt by the holy roman emperor, she's gunned down by the far more well trained than expected hussites.

She's a pikeman in a pike and shot formation, a cannonball tears her limb from limb as she's hit center mass.  
She's a soldier in the 80 years War, half starved and forced to fight with whatever is at hand as the Spanish siege of the fort drags on into its 7th month, disease eats her alive from the inside out before the Spanish can even get to her.  
She's a redcoat as napoleon blitzes across Europe, she's hit by a French sharpshooter and is dead before her body hit the ground.  
She's a French soldier huddled in a trench as an ear piercing whistle cuts through the sound of artillery fading into the distance and the pouring rain. By the time she's climbed up the ladder she's gunned down and falls back into the trench, the mud sucking out what little life was left.  
She's a pilot flying in the battle of brittain, the sky is black with German planes as her lone spitfire races to reach the bomber formation, she's shot down by the bombers machine guns, plane turning into a spinning fireball as her canopy refused to open.

She's seated in a helicopter with 8 others as 4 more helicopters fly over the jungle, the radio on her back is heavy but it's what keeps the squad alive. The second she steps off the helicopter she's shot between the eyes.  
She's a tank commander in a T-62 bought from the Soviets, she never saw the American tank that caused her and the rest of the crew to turn into a fine mist whilst the turret high fives the drone flying overhead.  
Shes a tank commander in a T-62 again. She never saw the drone dropping a grenade in the open hatch.  
She's an infantryman with a peacekeeping unit, the local with a vest had other plans.

She's a police officer, the peaceful protest suddenly turns violent as a molotove shatters on her ribcage and burns her alive.  
She's a politician, the dwindling resources on earth have necessitated a 5th attempt to reach the stars, unfortunately a rival or foreign party disagrees, her throat swells shut after she drank her spiked coffee.   
She's a civilian, a nobody when a sudden blinding flash ends everything.

She's an engineer aboard the aging ISS, atleast a century and a half past it's due date, a breach in the airlock has her eyes pop like gushers as her blood boils inside her veins from the sudden loss of pressure.  
At last she's reached the Nexus meeting humanity, the sleek rounded design of the ""Azure wraith"" glides through the void as it hails the somanied attempt to reach out into space.  
Contacting ground control and informing humanity of its existence.

Withdrawing her mind Selendis watches the crystal for a moment, there haven't been this many glimpses into the past that consistently end with the perspective being killed since the great schism, a worrying detail yet... Useful if they could be remodelled into forgetting most of their past. The last species to have had such a violent past was the Ilnux, though rendered extinct for their diet of sapient flesh.   
yet the Ulnin can make use of them, use them as the disposable might they see themselfs as and become the instrument of the Nexus' wrath and retribution, nothing more than a trained and leashed attack dog to sick onto whatever the Legion points at. 

Be it a planet wide rebellion, a newly discovered civlization ripe for conquest, or a threath to the Nexus.

Should I just break up with him?,"I havent wanted to have sex with my boyfriend in months and I dont see that changing any time soon. The last time we had sex was probably a month and a half ago and I didnt even want to, I just did it for him and I ended up crying and nobody finished. I know this probably isnt a dead bedroom yet but its heading there. I genuinely never want to have sex with him and dont even really like him touching me.

We have known each other for over 2 years and dated on and off in the beginning because of rocky circumstances, but finally settled in for the real thing and have been dating for probably like 9 months now. After a string of upsetting relationships (some of them very emotionally abusive/lots of getting cheated on and lied to) I found my now-boyfriend who was extremely patient, thoughtful, and considerate. He was affectionate, sexual, but always sweet and borderline obsessed with me. I was very in love and riding a high because Ive never had someone want me this much AND treat me well at the same time. Idk if ive even had anyone want me that much at all, tbh. But I had just come out of a relationship. I had complicated feelings for an ex who I had been best friends with for 4 years before ever dating him and I communicated it very clearly that we were still in contact and I wasnt ready for anything, so it didnt work out right away.

Anyway, we finally started dating for real. He is a really thoughtful partner and really affectionate, but two things:

  
1) While we were apart/not together, he slept with this female friend that I had previously felt weird around. She seemed to captivate him and I always felt invisible around her. The night we decided to go our separate ways he told me she was texting him wanting to fuck but he was grossed out by it because it was ""too forward"". Ive heard that before. We parted ways and of course he had sex with her. Its not like he did anything wrong but to be honest I feel lied to. He didnt have to pretend she was gross. My ex used to do that to get me to not worry about women that he would cheat on me with. I know he did nothing wrong but shes extremely hot. She looks like she could be in porn, and I didnt know he was into girls like that. I found out they slept together because I told him I felt weird with them being friends after she tried to fuck him and were dating now, and he agreed. He cut her off, and then at christmas I saw that he texted her Merry christmas and had deleted the entire chat before that. Not only did he reach out, he deleted the chat. I confronted him and he said its because he had spoken to her about needing to cut her off because they had sex and he didnt think I needed to know because it would just hurt me. But he told me before that the conversation he had with her about not talking anymore happened on the phone. 

2) He accidentally admitted that he didnt jerk off to me until over a year into knowing me. Months into being back together with him, he confessed that he jerked off to me for the first time the night before. He was embarrassed and thought it was some kind of cute confession, but I got extremely dejected. He immediately started apologizing and cursing at himself when he realized the implication: He knew me for over a year, we were on and off for some of that, and for the past 4 months or so we had been together... And he never jerked off to me? He watches porn and he jerks off, so that means for the full 2+ years we've known each other he never thought of me in private. He tried to swear Im sexy to him and all that but I dont even buy it. I think Im just a woman in front of him and hes horny so its convenient. I think he loves me but doesnt desire me. I think Im just 'good enough'. My illusion is completely shattered.

Maybe its stupid to some people, but I am wondering if I should just leave. Ever since all of that I havent wanted to kiss him, cuddle him, or have sex with him. If I ever do its jjust to get it over with. I asked him if he cheated on me and he got angry at me and said no and just got really irritated that I would think hed do that to me. I said I feel insecure because shes attractive and Im not and he watches porn and doesnt get off to me and that I think Im not his type and he got mad at that, saying he doesnt know where I got that from and being cold and mean. He eventually held me and said hes sorry I made him feel that way but I feel like Ive already frozen over.

I dont even feel in love with him anymore and Ive been thinking about other guys. Having crushes on them, imagining them being cute with me and daydreaming about romantic stuff with other people. Idek what he could say to me even if I communicated that would make me feel desired. I feel like I just need to end things. I just hate it because he is kind, thoughtful, etc. He makes me coffee in the morning, he buys gifts for no reason, he writes about me, gives me flowers, hugs and kisses me all the time, compliments me, texts me good morning and good night, etc. Its obvious he loves me and wants me to feel loved.

I got friendzoned by the girl that I dated the first time after 5 dates. I feel sad and hopeless.,"Some backstory: I‚Äôve never had any romantic experience in my life due to confidence and self esteem issues. Lately I‚Äôve started to kinda get better so I decided to try dating apps to start meeting people. They kinda are my only option right now, since I don‚Äôt meet girls I‚Äôm interested in through my friend groups (and no I don‚Äôt want to start a hobby just to meet girls, it just doesn‚Äôt seem right to me going to a hobby just for that).

So I downloaded tinder about a month ago and I matched with this girl first week and was the first and only date I‚Äôve managed to get out of the app. We went on 5 dates in the next 3 weeks, went for coffee, then a couple for drinks, then coffee at park and finally movie at my house. 

At the last movie date at my place, I had my arm behind her and we were cuddling halfway through the movie, and she was leaning on me a bit and I got that she enjoyed it. Then she recommends we watch another one. I kept staring at her at times in hopes of her turning around to kiss but that never happened. Also, when I dropped her off, I told her I had a great time while looking at her but she didn‚Äôt give me time to go for a move and just left after saying ‚Äúme too‚Äù. Then when I asked her if she wanted to plan another date right after she told me that lately she‚Äôs been viewing me as a friend but otherwise yes in a platonic way. And when I asked if it was because I didn‚Äôt make a move (I didn‚Äôt want to force it but maybe missed a signal or something) she told me it had nothing to do with that. Maybe it was because I was being very slow and almost didn‚Äôt flirt at all. 

We went out today for coffee in a friendly way, we had good conversation and all but when I asked her about if there was anything that I did that was wrong/turned her off, she said no and that it wasn‚Äôt about me. It didn‚Äôt feel like she wanted to talk too much about it so we changed subject. She insisted on paying for the coffees but also it felt like she was in a rush to go, and we were only out for a little less than 1.5 hours. I just wanted to know if I did something wrong so I can improve but she didn‚Äôt really give me anything insightful. Don‚Äôt know what to make of the whole situation.

I was confident that things were going well with her and I just kinda fell out of the clouds with that text. Since then I downloaded some other dating apps and have went on a date today and have 2 more planned on the weekend. The one today didn‚Äôt go bad, I‚Äôm just worried I give too much of a friendly vibe so maybe that‚Äôs a turn off when dating. Really I just don‚Äôt know how I am supposed to escalate things and not feel like a friend.

It‚Äôs just so tiring dating people and things going nowhere. And before someone says I‚Äôm only thinking about being a virgin and sex, I‚Äôm not, what I‚Äôm missing in my life is affection and having someone to love, and I‚Äôve never had that. And also I feel pressure to find someone since I‚Äôm already late and having no relationship/sex experience is going to become more of a problem as I get older. I don‚Äôt even know how to kiss‚Ä¶

I actually got to like her a lot and she is so sweet and it‚Äôs obvious she put effort to the post friendzone texts to make it less painful to me and she told me I treated her great and stuff, which honestly made it more painful because I can‚Äôt just say she sucked lol. Since the friendzone I‚Äôve just been feeling under the weather for the whole week so far, and I keep thinking of what I did wrong. 

At this rate I don‚Äôt know how many dates I‚Äôll have to go through to finally find someone, I feel kinda hopeless and tired, and I‚Äôm worried it will take way too long to finally find someone, and it‚Äôs so emotionally draining. 

Any advice or emotional support is greatly appreciated, and if someone has been in a similar situation to me I‚Äôd like to hear what their experience has been. Thanks for reading :)",3,1745608285.0,Healthygamergg,6,0.64,False

1k7t098,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k7t098,My (Sweden) camping/road trip setup in my Model Y,"I made the switch from a Model 3 to Model Y primarily so I can go camping with it. I tried sleeping in the 3 once but it was just too uncomfortable. I have now spent spent roughly 4 weeks since I got my Y 8 months ago. Here are some photos of my go-to setup when I'm travelling by myself. 

My favorite area to travel in is Scandinavia (Sweden and Norway) and I have seen almost every inch of it. Nice and peaceful backroads. Plenty of camping spots with no one around. It's especially great in the off-seasons (Spring and Fall) when the weather is not too bad, but there are not many people travelling. It's usually a little chillier during these seasons, but the Tesla always kept me warm at night (lost around 20-30 % in my SR over 10 hours keeping the inside at 19 degrees C while it was 0-5 degrees C outside).

In the photos you can see my general setup.

Sleeping: I use a regular mattress (80 cm by 200 cm) that needs a little squeezing to fit in there with just the 2 seats folded down, but it is super comfortable. At night I moved the driver seat all the way to the front to have the full 2m. Keeping the single seat in the back open allowed me to enter and exit my vehicle easily, no matter the weather. It acted as my hallway, where I would take my shoes and jackets off, or change. For privacy I bought some blackout covers for the 5 rear windows. For the front I got some curtains (specially made for cars) that hook into the ceiling and block the light (and view) from the front.

Storage: I stored food items in the passenger footwell area to have easy access. Items I used daily, like my backpack and jacket. Squeezed in the gap behind the driver seat and under the mattress I had mostly clothing I used on the daily. This also stopped the mattress from sagging. In the subtrunk I kept bulkier items I didn't need so frequently (pants, sweaters). In the trunk I kept my simple cooler (can be loud and annoying at night, so I turned it off for 4-5 hours every night) and water canister.

Cooking: When the weather allowed for it I used my frunk kitchen and gas stove. I kept all my cooking items in the frunk, as well as other dry ingredients, such as pasta and coffee powder. It's great to be able to cook a quick meal right at the trailhead parking lot after a long hike or in the morning after spending the night in the middle of nowhere. When it was raining I utilized on of these 12V heating lunch boxes which I used to heat up some simple ready meals (like soups).

Here‚Äôs how it changed my life,"Two months ago, I built and launched my first successful online business. I‚Äôve been struggling for 3 years, building and launching stuff into the void. This time was different. The timing and the skills I learned while building worked out. The product got immediate attention. First month it made $3.5k. Second ‚Äì close to $4.5k. It was nothing I ever experienced before. I quit my job and now I‚Äôm working as a solo founder full-time.

**Good things**

Here‚Äôs what has changed for the better.

The freedom is unparalleled. This feeling that you can go wherever you want and you don‚Äôt have to negotiate it with your boss ‚Äìintoxicating. The realization you built your own social system that earns money while you are sleeping ‚Äì impossible to grasp.

I ask my customers for feedback every day. From time to time they tell me they tried a lot of alternatives, and only my product worked for them ‚Äì this is just another level of bliss and meaning.

**Bad things**

Now to the bad things. Sometimes you get emails about bugs, or that something doesn‚Äôt work for a customer. It‚Äôs not always your fault, but it‚Äôs always your responsibility to provide excellent customer support and show you care.

The level of stress those situations create is nothing like I ever experienced in a 9-5. I missed dinners with my wife and walks with my family, because a third-party service that stopped working and I needed to jump on hot fixes.

A bright side of it ‚Äì I learned how to handle stress and separate my ego from my product. Sometimes you just need to turn your head off, otherwise you burn out.

**My daily schedule**

My work schedule didn‚Äôt change compared to the time when I worked in 9-5. I used to work every day except Saturday or Sunday, mostly in the morning, going to boxing classes in the evening. Now I keep doing the same.

I get up around 9, open my phone, look through the emails and hope nothing broke and I don‚Äôt see a lot of angry customer support requests. I answer some emails while still in bed. Then I go make black coffee, have it, and do some work. Morning is my most productive time.

I do about 2 hours of development, including bug fixes and UI/UX improvements, every day. The rest 6 hours is marketing ‚Äì talking to customers, doing sales calls with B2B folks, texting news and media, writing to X, Reddit, and LinkedIn.

When you become a founder, your daily schedule doesn‚Äôt change much on paper. But your inner feeling changes completely. Now you are the one responsible, and you have nowhere to run.

I had a lot of sleepless nights and I worry way more than on the job. But I also feel more powerful than ever.

Thanks to my product and sharing my story here and on X, I met a lot of insanely cool people. I managed to chat with Pieter Levels, who inspired me to become an indie hacker 3 years ago, talk to Marc Lou, and countless other people I look up to.

I feel like I‚Äôm doing what I was born to do. I have a business, my own users, and my own revenue. I would never trade it for anything else.

This is a long post. If you are curious about my product, it is called **Yadaphone**. It is a service that lets people make cheap international calls to mobile and landline numbers. Skype used to do that, but it closed and left its users clueless.

The moment was definitely good to launch, but without all my failures before, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have made a product that looks good and works well, and promoted it effectively. Definitely not in time to beat my competitors to it.

Either way, I‚Äôm grateful for my past, a bit nervous about the future, and freakin‚Äô enjoying the ride in the present.",31,1745607717.0,SideProject,25,0.88,False

Tiki the Fairy desperately wants to wear jeans instead of the mandatory ‚Äòtrad-fairy‚Äô sparkly dress. When she commits the sin of *empathy* by aiding a sad human, the Fairy State arrests her, sentencing her to be wasp food. Tense at times; but sweet and good-hearted.    

**Malafrenia**  -- Ursula Le Guin    
There‚Äôs no dragons here; just an imaginary European kingdom at the stage of early industrialization. Le Guin wants to depict the process of revolutionary thought, from school pranks and parental resentment moving to real revolutionary intent, on to conspiracies, arrests and imprisonments. Not a fun adventure tale; more an analysis of rebellion, the human spirit and the nature of oppression.  
Note that Le Guin was a serious protester of war, capitalism and colonization. Her other books also deal with revolt; notably ‚ÄòThe Word for World is Forest‚Äô, and ‚ÄòThe Dispossessed‚Äô.

Often the adventure goes dark; Alexander is drawing on stories of 18th and 19th century European revolutions; but also his own experiences in war.     

**The Moon is a Harsh Mistress** ‚Äì Robert Heinlein    
Heinlein doesn‚Äôt get the credit he deserves for examining humanity across decades. We just remember the militarism of ‚Äòstarship troopers‚Äô or the sex in ‚Äòstranger in a strange land‚Äô. But here he is pointedly narrating the logical progression of a revolution: from the motives of the leaders, to the organizing of the chain of revolutionary cells, on to the importance of propaganda, at last to the battles and barricades. Inspiring, logical, ‚Ä¶ and way more fun and exciting than most speculative novels, political or not. 

**Night Watch** ‚Äì Terry Pratchett      
Pratchett uses slapstick as delivery agent for the active ingredient of *Observations upon Humanity*. He stands on the street corner observing the wise and the foolish, the innocent and the experienced, the deadly and the harmless.  Finding what is interesting in their souls, as they lean against a lamp post, sip coffee in the office, - or wave a flag at the barricades.     
The genius of ‚ÄòNight Watch‚Äô is  in the POV of someone who already knows how the revolution shall go. Sam Vimes is a walking warehouse of cynical, worldly experience‚Ä¶ but he still can‚Äôt resist the ancestral desire to overthrow the tyrant.   

**A Specter Is Haunting Texas** -- Fritz Leiber    
A man from space comes to post-apocalypse Earth seeking funds for his acting troop. That part of Earth being controlled by mutant-tall Texan good-old-boys enjoying life at the expense of the shorter, darker working caste. Naturally, the hero joins (yes, a girl is involved) a revolutionary band performing plays to encourage insurrection.  A fun tale of future revolution weird yet understandable, as only Leiber can do.    

**Lord of Light** ‚Äì Roger Zelazny     
Colonists from Earth settle on distant planet. Centuries later their civilization remains pre-industrial, as science and technology are forbidden to all but a few.  The ‚Äòfew‚Äô being the original crew of the ship, who have made a paradise for themselves at the north pole. Declaring themselves the gods, they rule in a weird, colorful but monstrously oppressive imitation of the Vedas and myths of ancient India. Rule; until the last revolutionary declares it time for humanity to have can openers and TVs again.    

Let‚Äôs end with a revolutionary declaration from ‚ÄúLord of Light"":     

*""I shall tear these stars from out the heavens and hurl them in the faces of the gods, if this be necessary. I shall blaspheme in every Temple throughout the land. I shall take lives as a fisherman takes fish, by the net, if this be necessary. I shall mount me again up to the Celestial City, though every step be a flame or a naked sword and the way be guarded by tigers. One day will the gods look down from Heaven and see me upon the stair, bringing them the gift they fear most.‚Äù*

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1745607632.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

1k7stzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Encephalitis/comments/1k7stzi/48m_postcovid_psychotic_event_next_steps/,"48/m, post-covid psychotic event.  Next steps?","So in December 2023, I got COVID19.  I had had it before and mostly did ok.  Of note is in 2021 I had a bad reaction to the mRNA vaccine, which put in the hospital 5 days later with weird neurological issues - vertigo and pre-syncope.  I struggled for six months with dizzyness and vertigo but eventually it died down.

After the December 2023 event, things went downhill fast.  My neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio hit 9.5, which I""m told means underlying immune inflammation.  Over the next six weeks I would go to the hospital 6-7 times with weird symptoms - tachycardia, confusion, shortness of breath.  On every visit my neutrophils were high and my lymphocytes were low, with the ratio bouncing between 5.5 - 9.5.  On one visit my sodium was 129 (really low) and my phosphorus was too.  The next time sodium was back, but now my pancreas enzymes were out of whack.

Two days before my brain exploded, I once again went to the hospital knowing something was wrong and about to culminate.  On that test my NLR was 5.5 and my fibrinogen, an acute phase reactant apparently, was close to 500.  Over the next 36 hours or so, my brain would start going into an infinite loop trying to solve some puzzle that couldn't be solved.  While I was still sociable here, I was having trouble processing my thoughts.  My last night before pyschosis I had the most vivid dreams of my life, dreams about my body being deconstructed molecule by molecule and my essence being uploaded into a computer.  I dream my family had disowned me, and that I had done something so horrible that I would be executed for it.  When I woke up in the morning at my friends house, I had paranoia. I had breakfast like normal, but was distrustful of my friend who gave me a coffee.  He asked me to help work on his bicycle, which I did.  And in the process of trying to screw on a bike rack, I felt my brain finally let go. 

I was flooded with thoughts about some cosmic level crime I had committed that I would have to account for. If I didn't, thousands would be affected. I realized at the moment I needed to turn myself into the police, so I bolted from my friends house and set out on a multi-km adventure to run to the hospital and turn myself in.

During the day I would try stopping cars to get help, call 911 and ask them to come and get me.  At the hospital I tried to explain what I had done, but they didn't understand.  The police came and took me back to my house where they expected to see a crime spree, but there was nothing there.  They eventually took me back to the hospital and dumped me out front.  I checked myself in, but then I started hearing audio hallucinations which I thought were the police talking to me over the radio which I could suddenly hear in my head. 

I was told by the voice to go outside, where I would shot in the head by a sniper.  I did, but I wasn't shot. So the voice instructed me to walk around the city for several hours. During the process I checked my phone away, my keys, and placed my garmin watch on top of a garbage can.  I had conversations with people, I waited for stop lights, I went and had a coffee.  During this time the crime I had committed escalated in my head to a cosmic level, and the punishment was that my entire blood line was going to be wiped out, along with half of those from my origin country.  The voice told me to stop at the end of the street and take my clothes off, after which the police would pick me up and take me away to be executed.

At that point, people around me took notice. They called the police, and they came to get me. I gave them my ID willingly, I told them my history, we chatted about football and other sports.  We joked.  They eventually called an ambulance and took me to the hospital.  

At the hospital I gave them my history myself, but the voice in my head said to only tell them what was required.  On admission my HR was 134bpm, my CPK was almost 500, and my NLR was still out of whack.  

Over the next few days, I would slowly regain my senses.  It was almost like a computer rebooting piece by piece.  With each part that came back online, I felt my cognition slowly returning.  It was able to quickly deconstruct my experience and categorize it as delusional.   At the same time as my cognition came back, my NLR returned to normal as well as several other flagged parameters.

Unfortunately the diagnosis was a depressive episode that lead to psychosis.  Which may have been true, I don't know.  But immediately upon coming out of the hospital, I felt like I was still cognitively drunk, like I had suffered a stroke or something. In follow up care with the psychiatrist, I told her I felt like I had a stroke, like I had suffered some type of trauma, but she said it was just in head and was common with psychosis.  Went I told her there was no way I felt like I could drive, since I felt drunk, she dismissed it.

That was 14 months ago, and since then I've struggled with ongoing cognition issues and a general feeling of being unwell.  I had frequent crashes and highs and lows, and once and a while little twitches.  When I put the totality of my hospital reports and blood work into ChatGPT along with my timeline, it says there was a clear inflammatory, likely immune process that resulted in a multi-system collapse and psychosis.  It said it's most likely in the realm of auto-immune encephalitis.

So I don't want a diagnosis or medical advice.  But has anyone felt like they were incorrect diagnosed and managed to get a second opinion.  What should I do to maybe convince a medical professional to re-evaluate this case, especially in the context that I still have ongoing symptoms?",4,1745607366.0,Encephalitis,5,1.0,False

We picked an Airbnb outside of the tourist area as it was way cheaper and we also wanted to experience Rome's bit more than just the tourist areas. We got some groceries from a store near buy and also went for some pizza from a mom and pop shop. It was very good pizza.

We moved around by transit, as its way cheaper and it was fairly easy finding the bus stops following Google maps. We tried both, getting bus tickets and paying with our no phone/CC. I found that some buses had issues validating tickets and in tourist areas you could see the inspectors checking people's tickets.  So I would recommend paying by tap. Also while busses wouldn't lower itself to being stroller into the bus, most people were friendly enough to help us.

While my wife visited the Vatican museum, we visited a children's museum very close to the Vatican, it was awesome experience for the toddlers they enjoyed it. Only issue is you can only be there for 1:45 hr. And they have different time slots, 10am, 12pm, 2pm, 4pm and not sure if 6pm. We then meet up with her to go into the Basilica, I was surprised to see no line, it was less than 10 min total to get in.

We found that most of Rome was very easy to do with stroller, we didn't get to see as much as we would have wanted, as kids really enjoyed chasing pigeons around in all the different plazas. 

After doing the Coleseum the 2nd day and Palentine Hill, we took a shuttle to the airport to pickup our rental car at the airport. We book through Auto Europe and we went with Budget (only surprise was the car seats, which I thought were included but hadn't read my voucher properly).

I gotta say, Italian roads and drivers are something else. We first took a toll highway that was great, it's those side roads that are so small, there's no room for error and drivers tailgate you not even giving you a meter of separation (this is not an issue on highways). We made our first in Saturnia thermal springs, we have amazing weather and we're able to enjoy the hot water for a bit. Then we stopped in Pitigliano, what an amazing city, it really jumps out up in the hills. Then we drove to our Airbnb right on the border of Tuscany and Umbria and boy was I surprised with the winding roads, so many curves and turns, I live in SK in Canada and I can drive for hours before I see a curve or a hill. Google is super handy but at times it made us do some weird turns, thankfully my wife was an excellent copilot.

We stayed 3 nights at our Airbnb, first day we visited Montepulciano, beautiful town, but not stroller friendly. It has a nice playground once you enter the city and another one on the fortress on the Southside of the town, so we played there while my wife did some wine tastings. Pienza is very stroller friendly and has what think was the best view in Tuscany. It had a playground that at first we thought it was private as it seem to be inside something. Then we drove to the point marked as Val D'orcia but there was no space for parking and the girls were asleep, so we ended up driving back.

Swxondyday our host invited us over for coffee and then recommended us a Street Food Fest in Sinalunga, we didn't had anything plan for the day, and wanted to try something else other than pizza pasta or panini. They had some octopus burger and different kinds of foods, it was worth it, then our girls played in the playground picked up some groceries and went back to our Airbnb.

Then we headed to Cortona, not stroller friendly and Arezzo, I would also say not stroller friendly, but doable. The fortress at the top and the cathedral are fun places to visit 

Our 3rd Airbnb was an agritourism just 10 minutes outside of Tavernalle de Pessa, between Florence and Sienna.

My tips for Italy 

Data plan

We tried both Airalo and a local provider, at the airport they wanted to charge us ‚Ç¨80 euros for a 30 day plan, I had seen a tourist plan for ‚Ç¨29 at a dealer store with different providers they gave me a ‚Ç¨21 deal for 80GB and like 200 minutes. We spend some time in Tuscany outside of the main cities and wife wasn't always very reliable, so it all depends on what you need. If you are ok with minimal data Airalo offer was like $11US for 3GB but I had to buy an extra 1 for $4US.

Transit 

In Rome we just transit to move around, we did both bus tickets and paid using tap&go. I think tap is better as in some buses the machine to validates tickets wasn't working and inspectors are just waiting for tourists. So tap is more reliable. 

In Florence we used the tram, I wish you could buy a day ticket at the station, but it worked create for us, parked close to a station take the tram and don't worry about driving in the city. 

We used the train to travel from Lucca to Pisa. On the way there we bought a ticket and validated when we got in the train, on the way back we did the tap and go, you tap when you get on and tap when you get off, but I believe we forgot to tap on the way down, so don't do that or they will charge you the full price. 

Driving

Highways are great, people drive fast but nothing to crazy, I see people constantly asking about cameras , but there's signs for when you are about to go into a camera zone and goggle maps also shows them, at least most of them. ZTL are clearly mark, so they easily avoided.

Drivers in Italy love to tailgate when in side roads, but don't let that bother you, just drive at your pace, I slowed down and move right as much as I can to let them pass, but it's crazy that they barely keep a meter of separation. Side roads are beautiful but there are so many curves, distances might not seem much but it's hard to drive fast when turning so much. Google maps comes very handy as sides roads aren't alwyvery well marked, but it does some crazy turns so be sure to have a copilot handy checking what's coming ahead.

Budget 

I guess this more for this not wanting to spend a lot of money. We tried to keep a budget, we didn't eat out every day, and mostly did one meal a day when we did, of course we had gelato or a pastry, a lot of the times we would share a meal and that would be enough. Bigger grocery stores would offer pizza or paninis at a lower price than restaurants and still tasted very good. We weren't going in to every museum, only did the main attractions, luckily kids 6 and under usually don't pay.

So a day, I think we easily kept it at less than ‚Ç¨50 for us 4. We usually bought bread and meats and made sandwiches, got 1 or 2 gelatos and some kind of coffee, and we would either eat a big plate if pasta or share some pizza al taglio, so we didn't spend much. But we did ended up having a nice sit down dinner were we ordered a couple of pastas and Bistecca a la florentina, coupled with some wine and dessert and it cost us around ‚Ç¨75. I haven't done the final numbers but for all 4, counting for food, gifts, entrance to museums, gas, transportation (rental not included) parking, looks like we spent around $2000 give it take.

Most places take credit card/ Apple pay/tap to pay etc. a few street vendors only take cash.

We never got asked for tips, there's some cafe/gelterias that have tip jars but didn't feel pressure to tip at all.

Kids

We traveled with a 20 month old and a soon to be 4 year old. We had stroller for one, with a little seat in the back, but only 1 can be laying down at the time. We didn't find many places with diaper changing stations. We had a travel toilet seat for our oldest to make things a bit easier for her. We found restaurants would let us use their washroom without buying anything, but there's a bunch of public washrooms, but some are in really bad shape, even paying ones.

Everywhere we stopped had a at least a nice playground/park for kids to play, so we would see what we wanted and then stop at the playground. Our oldest loves dinosaurs and we found  the University of Florence natural museum worth it, Siena also has a natural museum that was very interesting, it's not crowded and has clean washrooms.

1k7srtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ostomy/comments/1k7srtn/infrequent_black_stool/,infrequent black stool,"Hi! I'm about 7 weeks out from my surgery, and back at work but still most definitely not fully recovered yet. However, I felt I was actually on track for recovery, but in the last week there has been some weirdness. I HAVE reached out to my doctor, gotten an urgent GI referral, some lab requisitions for Holter monitor & FIT test (my GI surgeon isn't available before my next appointment with her next week, but I am on the cancellation list).

That said, I'm just wondering if anyone else has had something similar early in their recovery journey and it turned out to be nothing or just something minor. So here's the skinny:

* passed out on getting up for the day on 4/16 - went over like a tree and cracked my head hard on kitchen floor, giving myself a bloody great goose egg, mild concussion and whiplash. (*I've been constantly some degree of tired and getting regular dizzy spells since the op, but dizzy spells are always as a result of exhaustion, over-exertion, dehydration or low blood sugar from not eating enough or often enough - but I thought I had that in hand as that was all decreasing and my energy and endurance have been improving by the day)*
* black stools in bag on both 4/22 & 4/23, both times in afternoon after lunch. looked like the colour of black coffee, easily that dark. In both cases, this lasted for 4-6 hours, and was after a period of some mild activity (think desk job, walking from desk to printer, doing little random jobs that need bending down and getting up, not picking up anything that weighs more than 5lbs (about 2kg). 
* Also on 4/22 and 4/23, at end of day had a sore, uncomfortable feeling like a stitch under my bottom left rib. Lasted for hours.
* constant very watery output all day on 4/24 - like, super watery - continuing today (4/25). Also, had very dark output yesterday afternoon around the same time (after lunch), but was super watery and not as dark as previous days. As fast as I empty my bag, it starts to fill again. 

I haven't changed my diet - still eating very restricted BRAT style diet - in the last few weeks, haven't added any new foods or drink, am drinking only water and a dietician approved electrolyte drink powder as needed. Activity is also very limited; not doing anything more strenuous than loading or unloading a dishwasher, moving some drinks around (think pop cans, no more than 2 at a time), walking is slow and limited. Limited bending, stretching and reaching, virtually no carrying,

To be clear, I understand that only a doctor can diagnose and treat, and that diagnostic tests are needed - this is in hand. My doc is on it. I just want to know if this resonates with anyone, and what was their outcome? I want to prepare myself. I didn't get that chance before the surgery and that has messed with me royally. I'd like to mentally ready myself for whatever may come, is all.

1k7sq9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cirkul/comments/1k7sq9t/best_flavors/,Best flavors?,"So I got my first Cirkul bottle because I saw a friend with one and had to try it. I admittedly got a few of the questionable flavors and then she gave me one to use until mine came because she didn‚Äôt like it and I see why. 

The one she let me have was the frosted Vanilla Iced Coffee. It was actually so gross but by then I had already placed an order with the mocha and hazelnut ones :( the order came today and I was soo disappointed again when I opened and tried the horchata one. Horchata is one of my favorite drinks and this just tastes weird. I expected more cinnamon and maybe a vanilla flavor profile but it just tastes like weird syrup. I took that one out after a few sips and thought to just try and fruity one and just assume that it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm trying all these flavors that are usually creamier and not just water. Well here I am drinking then ‚ÄúTropical Lemonade‚Äù flavor and it just tastes like straight up lemon juice. I get no tropical notes or even the sweetness of lemonade it‚Äôs just tart and lemony . It‚Äôs not as horrible as the other flavors I tried but man I I wish it was better! 

The other flavors in my order are frosted pink refresher, island punch, tropical blast, and honeycrisp apple.

Here's the thing. I would like to experiment more with coffee. I've got a list of premium ground coffees to try with a French press. The Cats Pyjamas is first up. But I'd prefer a lower-cost, instant option for an everyday coffee. My current living situation isn't conducive to getting fussy with brewing and it would be easier to share with the many people who have to drink the effing awful coffee this place provides if I can just pick up something that won't cost me the Earth.

  
My favourite coffee so far has been the Rep√∫blica Instant Decaf. I liked it so much I would drink it black and without sugar, despite usually having my coffee with milk and sugar. I see those torches rising again, put them down.

The coffee no longer needs to be Decaf. I'm just curious if there are other brands I should try as my experience is limited. For the record, I hated Robert Timms and Moccona was a bit too understated for me (not bad, just felt boring to drink and that was unpleasant). I've liked Nescafe gold before but it wasn't as good as Rep√∫blica.

1k7slkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1k7slkb/find_out_if_the_mueller_m99s_electric_kettle_is/,Find Out if the Mueller M99S Electric Kettle is Worth It Review,"The **Mueller M99S Ultra Kettle** has quickly become a staple in my daily kitchen routine, and after weeks of use, I feel ready to share my experience. This electric kettle promises a blend of functionality, design, and safety-centric features. I'll dive into all of its aspects: the good, the not-so-good, and how it stacks up against competitors. But does it live up to the hype? Let‚Äôs get brewing.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye when unboxing this electric kettle was its aesthetic. Sporting a borosilicate glass design paired with stainless steel accents, it feels pleasingly modern while maintaining durability. I was pleasantly surprised by how solid the kettle felt despite being lightweight at just 3 pounds. Additionally, the sleek blue LED light adds a stylish touch and serves as a functional feature, visually signaling when the water is heating. However, the glass finish means it needs regular cleaning to maintain its pristine look, as fingerprints and water stains can disrupt its clear surface.  

**Boiling Performance**  
If speed is what you're after, this kettle will not disappoint. Its 1500W SpeedBoil technology heats water in no time, whether it‚Äôs for tea, coffee, or oatmeal. I timed it myself, and it brought a full 1.8 liters of water to a rolling boil in just under 7 minutes. For households that rely heavily on hot water for various beverages, this feature feels like a blessing. The kettle also has a large capacity, offering up to 7 cups per fill, which came in handy when hosting family get-togethers.  

[Check **Mueller M99S** price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b07tz5yhjn/)

**Safety Features**  
Safety often gets overlooked with kitchen appliances, but not with this kettle. I tested the automatic shut-off feature a few times by letting it boil without attending to it, and it worked flawlessly each time. The boil-dry protection is another feature that provides peace of mind, ensuring the device won‚Äôt overheat if started with little or no water inside. The heat-resistant handle deserves a mention‚Äîit remains consistently cool, which eliminates the worry of accidental burns during pouring. From a safety perspective, this appliance checks all the boxes.  

**User Experience and Maintenance**  
The cordless design ensures easy handling, as the kettle detaches entirely from its base, making pouring a smooth experience. For someone like me, who hates being tied down by cables, this was a big win. The anti-scale mesh filter was another highlight for me, especially since I live in an area with hard water. It‚Äôs removable and washable, which makes maintenance a breeze. While cleaning the glass itself isn‚Äôt overly cumbersome, it does require frequent attention to keep it looking crystal-clear.  

**Highlights**  
- Heats water quickly with its powerful 1500W SpeedBoil technology.  
- Automatic shutoff and boil-dry protection provide additional safety features.  
- Large 1.8L capacity serves up to 7 cups, perfect for families or gatherings.  
- Elegant borosilicate glass build with stainless steel finish.  
- Cordless design with a heat-resistant handle for easy pouring.  

**Limitations**  
- The glass exterior tends to show fingerprints and water stains readily.  
- The LED light, while stylish, may not appeal to those preferring simpler designs.  
- The cord length feels a bit short, limiting placement near power outlets.  

**Competing Products**  
The Mueller M99S faces stiff competition from brands like Cuisinart and Hamilton Beach. While the Cuisinart PerfecTemp kettle offers precise temperature control, I found it slower at achieving a full boil. On the other hand, Hamilton Beach kettles are often budget-friendly but lack the premium glass-and-steel aesthetic of the M99S. The Mueller kettle wins in terms of design, capacity, and straightforward functionality, particularly for users not looking for gadgets with endless buttons and dials.  

**Value for Money**  
Price-wise, this electric kettle delivers great bang for the buck. While not the least-expensive option on the market, its combination of stylish design, safety features, and performance make it a particularly attractive choice for those willing to invest a bit more in quality. Given that I‚Äôve been relying on it daily without hiccups, the cost feels justified compared to less durable alternatives I‚Äôve owned in the past.

1k7sj5h,https://i.redd.it/b53gx4iuz0xe1.jpeg,Farmer Cabin (Coffee Pot Landing),"In 1901, Kneut Kneutson purchased one mile of Rock Harbor shoreline containing the Snug Harbor area. Kneutson and descendents developed ""Park Place"" - later renamed Rock Harbor Lodge - and catered to guests until the park service concessions took over the property in 1944. Kneutson's daughter Bertha and her husband Matt Farmer conveyed .88 acres of shoreline west of the Rock Harbor Lodge to their son Earl Weston Farmer and his wife Mary M. Farmer on May 25, 1935.

On August 18,1937 E.G. Willemin - on behalf of the National Park Service - advised Earl and Mary Farmer of their options for the property (life lease or cash value through condemnation). As these negotiations began Earl's grandfather, Kneutson, advised Earl to add Mary and the children to the life lease. At that time, sons Wes, Mike, Gerald and David Farmer were all between the ages of 7 and 12.

In October of 2002 Mary Farmer died. Her husband Earl Farmer had passed in 1981. Signed five-year Special Use Permits (expiration 2007) are now on file from Matthew Weston Farmer and from Gerald Thomas Farmer. A permit was sent to John Murray Farmer, residing in Calumet, MI, but signed copy not on file. These are the only children eligible for special use permits.

Cursed by Fate: Obsession of the D'Angeli



Chapter 1- Nicole


Lisa breezes into the restaurant and I raise my gaze to her. She grins as she makes her way to where I am seated. Her three-inch sandals tap the limestone floor as she walks by. 



""Hey, bestie."" She looks excited as she drops her colorful tote bag on the table before me and scans the hall expectantly. My guess is she either just completed a painting...or she knows my brother is coming.



""You look excited. Have you finally finished Cleopatra's Jewel?"" I give her a suspicious look as I pull out my phone and text my brother. 



Me: Bro, you're running fifteen minutes late. 



Lisa shakes her head. ""That painting's a bitch. I spent the afternoon getting some much needed sleep."" She takes a glance across the full restaurant again.



I sigh as I watch her. A text buzzes into my phone. 



Jos√©: Sorry, something came up. I'll be there in ten minutes. 



""Jos√© will be here in ten,"" I tell Lisa.



She smiles, showing her beautiful set of teeth. ""I'm sure I already knew. You don't usually invite me for dinner except when he's coming.""



I silently curse myself for being so predictable. But I'm more concerned about other things though. ""You know, under normal circumstances, this unhealthy infatuation you have for my brother should ruin our friendship.""



""But you love me,"" Lisa sings happily. 



She's right. It doesn't matter that she's currently involved in a one-sided romance with my brother. She's the best. She's super dependable and we've been friends since college. A beautiful artist with hair as dark as chocolate and a banging body. I'm surprised my brother doesn't notice this and I only imagine that it frustrates her. 



""I'm saying this because I love you. Jos√©... Jos√© is married to his work. I'm not sure he would notice even if love bit him in the ass."" I page the menu, looking for something I hopefully won't regret. 



The last time I wanted to try something different, it didn't end well. I couldn't stop thinking that the soup tasted like how boiled boots would taste if they were ever cooked... with lots of spices.



Lisa looks like she just figured out the last piece to a very important puzzle. ""I think it's precisely because he's tied to his work that he doesn't notice me."" When I register my confusion, she continues. ""Clearly, his job is just too interesting. I wouldn't be surprised to find out he's low-key in the mob. He might even be a member of the CIA or some other international spy organization like that. Their lives are very interesting, you know. Full of action. Most women are sapiosexual- I mean, any woman would be turned on by a man that is fucking intelligent it's almost oppressive. Brain over brawn or shit. But sometimes I just want testosterone, baby. Those guys...they have lots and lots of it. ""



I turn around the restaurant to check that there are not a lot of people who witness my best friend embarrassing me in public. On top of that, she's talking about my brother. This is why your best friend shouldn't date your brother. There's bound to be information floating between you two that should legit be labeled with the TMI tag. 



""You sound like a horny creep. Have some decency."" 



But Lisa just laughs. ""Think about it. I might be right. Those unexplained trips that big brother goes on and doesn't tell you about? How he's never around yet you two live together?""



I laugh. Because it's hilarious. Jos√© is too boring for that kind of life. ""Don't be ridiculous,"" I say. ""My brother is a boring police detective. The most exciting thing in his day would probably be a colleague bringing in a cup of coffee while he's poring over legions of police reports.""



Lisa shrugs anyway, saying, ""His bad boy aura is a real pull though,"" and I want to ask her to drop the topic but I must admit that her thoughts are amusing. 



But that is one of the best things about her. How she is so creative, carefree and yet so talented. Her paintings make big bucks in the art galleries she has partnerships with and she works whenever she likes, however she likes (with art, the threshold of definition is quite wide). She even dresses how she likes to work- which is her open floor plan workspace directly over her living room.



Unlike me who is dressed in a black suit jacket and skirt, having come directly from my workplace, she's wearing harem pants, a halter neck top and half of her hair is tied in a handkerchief. So damn carefree. 



""You sound so ridiculous."" I roll my eyes.



She gnaws on her pinky finger nail as her eyes skim the menu. 



""At least I'm making an attempt to find a man,"" she counters. ""You're a fucking celibate when it comes to these things.""



Did I mention she swears like a sailor?



""I've only met my fair share of assholes so I'm on a break,"" I tell her. 



She agrees. She knows why I don't even discuss my ex. ""Plus your new head of department.""



""Please-""



""-That guy stares at you like a fucking predator,"" Lisa continues. ""File a complaint against him so that his ass ends up in jail.""



""He's my direct superior,"" I warn her. ""And apart from some inappropriate comments, he doesn't really do anything. I can't file a complaint for that now, can I? The creep would just plead misinterpretation on my part. And then mark my name so he can torture me some more. He added me to the team for a report gathering at Parliament. Now I have to go there everyday with the rest of those assigned that beat.""



""No!"" Lisa looks like she doesn't believe it. ""You hate that shit.""



""It's boring. Half of what I hear, I don't even understand and I'm supposed to take note of everything.""



""I still don't get it."" Lisa adjusts on her seat. ""You still appear on the evening news with a smile anyone can drown in. Like your job is all glamor and T.V. All of this politeness and courtesy and politics you do in your workplace, I wouldn't be able to stand it. I would be fired in my first week.""



And that is why she's the artist and I'm the reporter. 



I grab my phone to text my brother once again but then the restaurant door opens and he's there, making his way towards us. He takes after our father. He has thick, unruly hair and about six feet of height. Not me that needs four inches of heel to reach his cheek.



He reaches me and pecks my hair. I smile at him. ""Took you long enough.""



He turns to Lisa. ""Hello.""



Lisa gives him a wide smile, her cheeks coloring instantly. ""Hi.""



""Have you ladies had something to eat?""



""No, we've been waiting for your highness to make an appearance."" I pull him down to sit. 



I don't like the way he looks impatient, like he would easily just turn and leave for one task by his boss or the other like he used to. I hold on to his arm like it could stop him from leaving even if he wanted to. 



He laughs at my words. ""Nicole‚Ä¶ I already apologized."" He waves a waiter over. 



I shrug and tap my finger on the menu. ""I've already made up my mind. I'm taking the potato, salmon and asparagus salad.""



Jos√©'s eyes appraise me. ""Not your regular?""



""I'm trying something different tonight.""



""I think I should do the same,"" Lisa chirps. ""What does their tortellini taste like?""



I shake my head. ""Don't go there. Just go for a classic pasta.""



Jos√© throws me a gaze as Lisa laughs and decides to change her mind. ""I'm sure it's not that bad-""



Before he can finish his sentence, his phone buzzes beside his hand on the table. It sounds so insistent in my ears that for a while it's all I can hear. I should know that my older brother's phone has only ever been on vibrate for as long as I've known him yet every new call rings in my head with the intensity of actual words singing ""Pick up the phone. Pick it up,"" only it's not a singsong voice. It's a snappy, annoyed, slightly menacing voice saying that. 



This is crazy. And sometimes I just don't know the kind of things that run in my head. It might also be Lisa too. I can't get her words out. Why is Jos√©'s job so demanding?



Jos√© hesitates for a few seconds as he watches his phone vibrate on the table in the silence that ensues between us. He finally declines the call from whoever it is. When he raises his gaze to us, the waiter is here. 



He smiles at me and I smile back. ""Time to order,"" he says. 







Chapter 2- Roman


There is the distinct smell of smoke in the air, so subtle I can almost not notice.



My gaze shoots up and scans the upholstery sofas in front of me. Javi is busy with his phone as he is seated on one of them. Behind him, I'm greeted by the cool backdrop of the city at night as a cool breeze blows around the balcony.



I turn behind me to see Vito, the youngest of us and my brother. He leans on the edge of the balustrade and his gaze is on the spread of the palatial estate below us. He has just lit a cigarette and is taking a long drag.



The glare I give him speaks volumes. He knows the rules about drugs. We don't tolerate them at all. In whatever shape or form. Because we have an endless supply. That is our trade and our trade depends on the dependency of others not our dependency. 



He sends me a dirty look as he pulls the stick out of his mouth and then stumps it with his boot. 



Our cousin, Javi, chuckles quietly and I drum my fingers impatiently on the table before me. My gaze darts very frequently to the closed door that separates this space from the room beyond it. Inside it is my father, Don Riccardo D'Angeli, with the Don of one of our rival families. The Coppola. This family has held New York in their grasp for the longest time and in doing so, they've stepped on several people's toes, including ours. 



While I am perfectly comfortable with never-ending family wars, such things weren't good for business and so every once in a while, families tried to see if they could reach mutual agreement; see one another's side. For the good of business. That is the aim of my father's conversation with the Don of The Coppola. 



The conversation has lasted an hour now and it's only taking all of my patience to not tear the door down and ask what the hell they're still discussing up till this moment... because I don't trust these Coppola bastards one bit. My father is in there with their Don, Manfredi Capitani and said Don has a guard with him. Though I know that my father can take care of himself, still, waiting is not one of the things I do best.



I almost need Vito's smoke now. 



""Will you try to relax?"" Javi turns to me, looking at me seriously. ""Your impatience is leaking everywhere.""



""You know I don't trust these people.""



""They won't try to fuck with us,"" Javi says with conviction. ""They know that if they try to do anything, it will end in a war they won't get out of until they pay with all their lives.""



""Their deaths won't be quick either,"" I mutter under my breath.



""Remind me again why we need to see eye to eye with these bastards?"" Vito asks. He turns to Javi and I who are seated around the balcony center table. ""The Coppola are our second worst enemies after The Sacra. Our family histories go way back. I want to blow this place up.""



""For the first time in a while, I agree with Vito,"" I say calmly. ""A little spring cleaning in this city shouldn't hurt anyone. They certainly won't be missed.""



Javi grins and I sit back in silence. ""You D'Angelis are crazy fuckers, you know that?"" He says. ""One has a deathly calm and the other works like an inferno is always brewing inside him. Yet, both are just as dangerous and unstable as each other.""



""Where does that put you?"" Vito asks him. ""You seem to forget that you're also a D'Angeli.""



""I'm the sane one,"" Javi says. ""I restore order and sanity because you two need it.""



Vito lets out a bark of laughter. He looks like he's in a better mood than he started with. I still have my ever present scowl on my face. My mood has not changed in the slightest, but then, it's difficult for anyone to tell. With me, it's always a cold, hard mask. I've been told several times. 



*We're doing this because The Coppola apparently has links with The Syndicate,"" I start. The words are bitter in my mouth. ""And we need The Syndicate on board because we want to use their territory to transport a very important shipment and we want this to happen without incident. Expansion is a very delicate thing. It comes with a bit of sacrifice...like our current plans for an alliance with The Coppola.""



Turns out The Syndicate hates our guts even more than The Coppola does. Definitely, this has something to do with Manfredi Capitani and so the plan is to deal with the opposition at its roots. 



""The wife of the Don of The Syndicate is unfortunately our host, Manfredi Capitani's daughter,"" Javi continues. 



""Well, fuck."" Vito relaxes, realizing how important this meeting is; how course-changing it can be. 



My gaze locks on the door as a sound comes from it. In seconds, my father is exiting the room with Manfredi Capitani by his side as the ornate oakwood door swings open. While my father is taller with broader shoulders, Manfredi is stockier and a few inches shorter. His black, close-cropped hair is dark brown unlike my father's which is black. 



They're both fucking smiling when they join us on the balcony. Javi's gaze meets mine and whatever communication he expects, he doesn't get it because my stare is blank. Vito is beside my father as he walks to the recliners to meet us.



My father and Manfredi shake hands again as they communicate in low tones. 



""I hope this is the first step to ending the war between our families. Now that we're family, hopefully, it is easier."" Manfredi has a solemn look on his face. He tries to break his expression to accommodate a smile. It fails. 



The only thing that I register in my head is his second statement and I want to ask my father what the fuck is going on. 



My father finally motions to us and I rise to my full height. Javi gets up too. 



""Gentlemen,"" my father addresses us. ""Today, Manfredi and I have come to the agreement that The Coppola and The Mazza will unite in marriage.""



My brothers have the same expression on their faces. Like me, they're wondering if he assumes that any of the D'Angeli sons are husband material. I am sure my father is aware that we are too crazy for that. Maybe Javi would manage, but between me and Vito, it's a bloody gamble. 



""I am offering my oldest daughter, Teodora, for the marriage and The Coppola has accepted for her to marry their son,"" my father continues. 



Even worse, he's marrying one of my sisters off for this, not one of the sons of the family. For a deal. That's how fucked up the whole thing is. In our kind of life, as sacred as the institution of marriage is, it is up for cheap use whenever the occasion comes.



Through marriages in the mafia, wars have been stopped between clashing families, and peace treaties have been sealed. It will be used here too. And one of my sisters will be the item. Messed up. But they've known before now that this day would come. And my father would only marry them to other high-ranking members of other families and not some loverboy of their choice, hence their fates were already sealed. Better a marriage that brings the family some benefit than not. Marrying outsiders is not allowed. 



But I am sure my father is aware that the person that would make me do anything but what I wanted has not been born yet. 



""Your family must treat her well,"" I finally say. ""If your son hurts her, I will fucking carve him out on a slab.""



""Bear in mind that not just peace, but the heads of every single member of your family is at risk if something happens to her."" Javi sizes Manfredi Capitani up quietly.



Vito is closest to Manfredi Capitani yet his voice is loudest. ""The women in our family are treated like fucking royalty, understand?"" 



While my father's gaze seems to say we could all do better given that this man is our new in-law, I cannot ignore the glimmer of pride in his eyes as we unite in our sister's defense through our threats. But my father is a pain in the ass so he still berates us. 



""I believe from now on, you will speak to your in-laws with more respect.""



Javi slips his hands in his pockets and leans back. My face is expressionless.



""You have enigmatic sons,"" Manfredi says as he lets out a deep belly laugh. ""They remind me of my son too. Let it be known then that just as your threats aren't empty, our promises to your family in this marriage are not. This is a new beginning. Let us celebrate it."" 



My father smiles and despite our earlier animosity, the atmosphere is not so tense any more. 



I stand silent as my father and Manfredi talk some more about the marriage, my mind drifting in and out. My phone buzzes in my pocket and I excuse myself to the edge of the guard rail and pick up the call.



""We've finally tracked the home of the spy."" This is one of my father's Made Men who days ago was charged with the responsibility of finding out the location of a spy that we'd unwittingly let into our midst. This spy had run away with information that could ruin us. So the fact that we now know where he lives sounds like good news to me.



As my father's second-in-command and Underboss, it is my job to handle things like this. The family is my primary responsibility. So is protecting it and its secrets. 



""Bring him to me tonight,"" I reply. ""His death will be slow and painful. I will enjoy every moment of that torture before he passes.""



""Yes sir.""



My night is finally looking up. 



I join my father and brothers. They are about to leave. Great. I can't wait to be gone from this place. 







Chapter 3- Nicole


Lisa is staring at my brother from across the table again. I kick her calf from under the table. She lets out a small yelp and gives me a dirty look. I send her a text. 



Me: Bitch, can you be more obvious?



She discreetly gives me the finger when Jos√© peers down to his phone to look at something. I roll my eyes at her. I only need her to bang Jos√© in front of me right now for her to completely traumatize me. 



A text pings into my phone. 



Lisa: Can you ask your brother to notice me for once? Tell him it's hard trying to catch his attention.



I let out a bark of laughter and then chug my drink quickly. But Jos√© doesn't even notice. He's too busy with something on his phone as usual.



As I raise my fork to try another attempt at eating what I ordered tonight, Jos√©'s phone rings with insistence. I can feel the aggressive vibration from the table since his hand is on it. So is mine. He gets up abruptly and I turn to him. 



He slips his phone inside his pocket and downs his glass of Pinot Noir. He gives me a hasty peck on the cheek. 



""Are you leaving?"" My gaze is on him. 



""Something just came up at the office,"" he says, picking up his keys and slipping them inside his pocket as he pushes his chair back. 



I check the time on my phone. ""Jos√©, it's very late."" 



He shrugs. ""Yeah, tough bosses. I'll see you tomorrow. Don't stay up.""



He's gone in a second. 



My gaze turns to Lisa. She has a sympathetic look on her face. She knows how close I am with my brother and she knows that it kills me that we can't spend enough time together because he's usually so busy working. 



Only she would understand because that part of my history is not something that many people know. Our parents died in a fire that engulfed our house and we pretty much moved into the foster system soon after that. When we got old enough and got out, Jos√© took upon himself the responsibility of fending for both of us. He was older and he got out faster than I did. He had already started to work before I got out. 



When I was out, he took me in. He had an apartment at the time. He was doing pretty well by then. Throughout college, I didn't know how much he worked. I didn't get to see it because I was at school. B",1,1745606454.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôd love to meet others who are going through similar experiences‚Äîwhether your pup is fearful, reactive, or just a bit ‚Äúspicy.‚Äù Would be great to grab a coffee/go on a walk and share experiences/knowledge!

I live in a 1 bed 1 bath 900 sq ft unit. My monthly rent is 1369 and my lease will end in September. I was accepted into a graduate program in California and am aiming to be out of my apartment by no later than May 25th so the sooner we can start this process, the better! I will not add pictures of my unit on here because it is not tidy (starting to pack) but here is the link: https://www.fallingwaterapartments.com/apartments/nv/las-vegas/photo-gallery 

You can see the apartment layout and it‚Äôs identical to the last few pics aside from the fact that I have light brown cabinets. I absolutely love the location as it‚Äôs right off the freeway and close to loads of restaurants, trails, and stores. 

The process would be easy, the apartments don‚Äôt do lease relets but I would sign you on as my roomate, you‚Äôd have to do the application and meet the requirements (2.5x base rent I believe) and get approved. I would then remove myself as your roomate and you‚Äôd be the sole tenant. I‚Äôd like to do this as quickly and smoothly as possible and I‚Äôm down to let you tour my place if you‚Äôd like to see it for yourself before we start the process. 

My current rate is below average for a unit in this area and below the rate for many complexes around Vegas! I‚Äôd also let you keep my furniture (queen sized bed frame, white drawers, white couch, coffee table, dining table and chairs, and tv stand) for a fee of $700. Everything is great condition. I also have a rug but I have a dog and it‚Äôs hard to vacuum so I‚Äôll let you keep that for free if you want it as well as a TV stand that I‚Äôll let you keep for free as well.

My husband (32M) and I(32F) had our civil ceremony last November, five months ago. Ever since then, I feel like people have been showing me their whole a**! My biggest issue has been his ""sister"" (33F), who is not actually blood related to him, but they are have been friends for a long time and call one another brother and sister. Now, I am not one to have an issue with my partner having close relationships with someone of the opposite sex. Especially when that someone has been in their life way before I came into the picture, my concern is with setting boundaries.

I have a STRONG feeling that his sister is secretly in love with him and competing with me. Let me tell you why. First of all, she always has the need to tell me how she comes first and how no woman can be in his life without her approval. First red flag that I shouldn't have ignored. Here's another offense, we're on the phone one day, and she starts to express how my husband (then boyfriend) is the most important man in her life, that she would do anything for, and specifically stated that no one else matters. Like wtf!?!? But it doesn't end there. After we have our civil wedding, I don't hear from her for some time, shes allegedly mad because she called us on the day of the wedding and her brother didn't answer, probably because we're getting freakin married but I digress. Note that she was unable to attend because our civil wedding was held outside the country, and she was unable to travel. One of her good friends did me a solid and made me a dress for our wedding brunch on short notice, with a 24-hour turnaround time. When I get back to the states, we finally have a conversation, and I thank her for connecting me with her seamstress. Her response is, ""If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have had a dress."" Not 'you're welcome' or 'gladly,' just that. She also felt the need to tell me to postpone my wedding until she knows for sure if she'll be able to attend, because we can't have a wedding if she is not there. Oh, and yeah, I shouldn't plan a wedding that will cost her brother too much. Like who tf are you?!?!

Things have escalated most recently when I started discussing our actual wedding plans with her (requested by my husband to include her), and I shared with her that I want to use the same makeup artist from my civil wedding. She responds by telling me that the makeup artist didn't do a good job, and I didn't look pretty on my civil wedding day. Is that not freakin insane! Is this not someone who harbors some secret animosity, mixed with mean girl energy? Mind you, she copies everything I do. She even decorated her living room EXACTLY like mine, from the coffee table, couch down to the the damn carpet. EXACT SAME THING, not even a different color. This is me only touching the surface of her bullshit. What makes it harder is that my husband makes excuses for her behavior and acts like the things she says aren't a big deal. It's turned into a whole big thing, and now he and I are at odds over me blowing up on him. I feel like he's not standing up for me and refuses to acknowledge that she is overstepping based on their history.

Ive tried to ignore most of this because she has a good side. She's giving and takes care of her people. I have to give her credit when it's due, but when it comes to my relationship and especially this wedding, I want her far away from it. Am I overthinking this?",20,1745606138.0,Marriage,42,0.92,False

I feel like mentally I'm much less anxious than I was while drinking. I'm thinking clearly, I'm more calm and go with the flow. I'm getting angry much less.  

But for the last month my body has been feeling like I'm having panic attacks. Jumpy, racing heart rate, clenched muscles. Usually gets worse throughout the day. It's pretty impactful on my day and is really uncomfortable physically. But I do not have an anxious thought in my brain when it's happening.  

And most interestingly, I never had these sensations while drinking. Never had a racing heart or muscle twitches, nothing.  

It's like my body got the anxiety from my brain in the alcohol divorce.  

Any one else experience this? I was at my doctor for a workplace physical after quitting and extensive routine blood work showed everything normal.

I don‚Äôt usually write reviews. I‚Äôm a busy mom of three, and like most people, I‚Äôve bought tons of products online. But when something genuinely transforms your life ‚Äì and I mean truly makes a real difference ‚Äì you owe it to the world to share. That‚Äôs exactly what the Aqua Tower did for us.



‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



Let me take you back a few months.



Our family had been struggling with constant health issues ‚Äì nothing major, but those annoying, everyday things: fatigue, dry skin, weird stomach upsets, and a general lack of energy. We thought it was just the stress of life or diet, until one day I saw a shocking report online about what‚Äôs really in tap water ‚Äì heavy metals, chlorine, microplastics... I was stunned. I ran to the kitchen and stared at the glass of water on the table, suddenly unsure if I was helping or hurting my family by letting them drink it.



That night, I started researching water purifiers ‚Äì and I discovered the Aqua Tower.



Why Aqua Tower?

Out of all the water purifiers I came across, Aqua Tower stood out like a shining star. The features were mind-blowing:



7-Stage Ultra Filtration ‚Äì Not just your basic carbon filter. This baby goes ALL OUT: sediment removal, activated carbon, ion exchange, and more.



Removes 99.99% of Contaminants ‚Äì Lead, chlorine, bacteria, heavy metals, even pharmaceutical residues. Yes, those can end up in your water.



No Electricity Required ‚Äì Completely gravity-based. So eco-friendly, and perfect even during power outages.



Huge Capacity ‚Äì The 4-gallon tank is perfect for large families like ours.



Easy Maintenance ‚Äì Filters last long, and the replacement process is simple.



Modern, Sleek Design ‚Äì Looks great on the countertop. Not bulky or ugly like other purifiers.



I was sold. I ordered it that night.



Unboxing & Setup ‚Äì So Easy a 10-Year-Old Could Do It

When the Aqua Tower arrived, it was packed beautifully and securely. Every piece felt solid and high-quality. Setup took maybe 10 minutes ‚Äì no tools, no plumbing, no stress. It‚Äôs literally ‚Äústack and go.‚Äù We filled the tank, waited a bit for the water to filter, and then... we took our first sip.



OH. MY. GOD.



This wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúclean‚Äù water ‚Äì it was delicious. Smooth, refreshing, almost sweet. My husband ‚Äì a total skeptic ‚Äì raised his eyebrows and said, ‚ÄúWow. This tastes amazing.‚Äù Even the kids started drinking more water on their own, which, if you‚Äôre a parent, you know is a miracle.



The Real Results ‚Äì What Happened Next Shocked Us

Within just two weeks, I noticed a change.



My morning bloating was gone.



My skin cleared up ‚Äì my face literally started glowing.



My husband, who always complained about being tired, said he felt more energized and focused at work.



The kids stopped getting random stomach aches that we used to brush off.



Even our coffee tasted better ‚Äì it‚Äôs unbelievable how much difference clean water makes in everything.



I realized‚Ä¶ we‚Äôd been poisoning ourselves slowly, every single day, without knowing. The Aqua Tower didn‚Äôt just give us clean water ‚Äì it gave us peace of mind, health, and happiness.



Cost vs. Value ‚Äì A No-Brainer

Let‚Äôs talk money.



Sure, you can buy cheap filters for $30 here and there. But they barely do anything. Most don‚Äôt even touch heavy metals or microplastics. The Aqua Tower, on the other hand, is a complete water purification system. It's worth every penny ‚Äì especially when you think about:



No more bottled water expenses (we used to spend over $100/month!)



Fewer doctor visits



Better health, better hydration, better energy



Less environmental waste



And the filters? They last months and cost very little to replace compared to others.



If you care even a little about your family‚Äôs well-being, this isn‚Äôt a luxury ‚Äì it‚Äôs a necessity.



The One Thing I Wish I Did Sooner...

My only regret? Not buying this sooner.



We wasted years drinking questionable tap water. If I had known the damage it was doing, I would‚Äôve rushed to get the Aqua Tower the moment it launched.



I‚Äôve now recommended it to my sister, my parents, and even my coworkers. Every single one of them is raving about it.



Final Thoughts ‚Äì A Must-Have in Every Home

In today‚Äôs world, where clean water is no longer a guarantee, having a trustworthy filtration system is non-negotiable. The Aqua Tower isn‚Äôt just a product ‚Äì it‚Äôs a health revolution in your kitchen.



I sleep better at night knowing my kids are drinking the cleanest, purest water on Earth. And that‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt put a price on.



So if you‚Äôre reading this, wondering whether it‚Äôs worth it ‚Äì let me tell you: YES. Buy it. Right now. Don‚Äôt wait. Your body will thank you. Your family will thank you. Your future self will thank you.



10/10. Highly recommended. I‚Äôd give it 100 stars if I could. üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü",1,1745606082.0,aliner,1,1.0,False

Let me take you back a few months.



Our family had been struggling with constant health issues ‚Äì nothing major, but those annoying, everyday things: fatigue, dry skin, weird stomach upsets, and a general lack of energy. We thought it was just the stress of life or diet, until one day I saw a shocking report online about what‚Äôs really in tap water ‚Äì heavy metals, chlorine, microplastics... I was stunned. I ran to the kitchen and stared at the glass of water on the table, suddenly unsure if I was helping or hurting my family by letting them drink it.



That night, I started researching water purifiers ‚Äì and I discovered the Aqua Tower.



Why Aqua Tower?

Out of all the water purifiers I came across, Aqua Tower stood out like a shining star. The features were mind-blowing:



7-Stage Ultra Filtration ‚Äì Not just your basic carbon filter. This baby goes ALL OUT: sediment removal, activated carbon, ion exchange, and more.



Removes 99.99% of Contaminants ‚Äì Lead, chlorine, bacteria, heavy metals, even pharmaceutical residues. Yes, those can end up in your water.



No Electricity Required ‚Äì Completely gravity-based. So eco-friendly, and perfect even during power outages.



Huge Capacity ‚Äì The 4-gallon tank is perfect for large families like ours.



Easy Maintenance ‚Äì Filters last long, and the replacement process is simple.



Modern, Sleek Design ‚Äì Looks great on the countertop. Not bulky or ugly like other purifiers.



I was sold. I ordered it that night.



Unboxing & Setup ‚Äì So Easy a 10-Year-Old Could Do It

When the Aqua Tower arrived, it was packed beautifully and securely. Every piece felt solid and high-quality. Setup took maybe 10 minutes ‚Äì no tools, no plumbing, no stress. It‚Äôs literally ‚Äústack and go.‚Äù We filled the tank, waited a bit for the water to filter, and then... we took our first sip.



OH. MY. GOD.



This wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúclean‚Äù water ‚Äì it was delicious. Smooth, refreshing, almost sweet. My husband ‚Äì a total skeptic ‚Äì raised his eyebrows and said, ‚ÄúWow. This tastes amazing.‚Äù Even the kids started drinking more water on their own, which, if you‚Äôre a parent, you know is a miracle.



The Real Results ‚Äì What Happened Next Shocked Us

Within just two weeks, I noticed a change.



My morning bloating was gone.



My skin cleared up ‚Äì my face literally started glowing.



My husband, who always complained about being tired, said he felt more energized and focused at work.



The kids stopped getting random stomach aches that we used to brush off.



Even our coffee tasted better ‚Äì it‚Äôs unbelievable how much difference clean water makes in everything.



I realized‚Ä¶ we‚Äôd been poisoning ourselves slowly, every single day, without knowing. The Aqua Tower didn‚Äôt just give us clean water ‚Äì it gave us peace of mind, health, and happiness.



Cost vs. Value ‚Äì A No-Brainer

Let‚Äôs talk money.



Sure, you can buy cheap filters for $30 here and there. But they barely do anything. Most don‚Äôt even touch heavy metals or microplastics. The Aqua Tower, on the other hand, is a complete water purification system. It's worth every penny ‚Äì especially when you think about:



No more bottled water expenses (we used to spend over $100/month!)



Fewer doctor visits



Better health, better hydration, better energy



Less environmental waste



And the filters? They last months and cost very little to replace compared to others.



If you care even a little about your family‚Äôs well-being, this isn‚Äôt a luxury ‚Äì it‚Äôs a necessity.



The One Thing I Wish I Did Sooner...

My only regret? Not buying this sooner.



We wasted years drinking questionable tap water. If I had known the damage it was doing, I would‚Äôve rushed to get the Aqua Tower the moment it launched.



I‚Äôve now recommended it to my sister, my parents, and even my coworkers. Every single one of them is raving about it.



Final Thoughts ‚Äì A Must-Have in Every Home

In today‚Äôs world, where clean water is no longer a guarantee, having a trustworthy filtration system is non-negotiable. The Aqua Tower isn‚Äôt just a product ‚Äì it‚Äôs a health revolution in your kitchen.



I sleep better at night knowing my kids are drinking the cleanest, purest water on Earth. And that‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt put a price on.



So if you‚Äôre reading this, wondering whether it‚Äôs worth it ‚Äì let me tell you: YES. Buy it. Right now. Don‚Äôt wait. Your body will thank you. Your family will thank you. Your future self will thank you.

She Doesn't Know That I Know - UPDATE 11 - Bev's Husband and Postnuptial Agreement,"The owner of the AirBnB has started having furniture delivered. I have pushed it around and set it up in places.  In some cases, I put it together.  

In the living area, I set up a huge TV and then set the coffee table in front of it, two armchairs behind the coffee table, and the couch behind the two armchairs.  

The interior decorator the owner hired came in and laughed at me and told me it ""looked like Star Trek"".

I impressed her with feats of strength moving around furniture and hanging pictures and shelves.  She offered me a job.  At the end of it all I asked if she was flirting with me (because I'm stupid like that) and she said ""yes"" and gave me her card.

I called up my lawyer and she called me back eventually and I asked her about maybe going out on a date with someone and she metaphorically dope slapped me upside my head and told me that no, I couldn't go commit adultery with anyone during my at fault divorce for adultery.  Oh well.

But, man she was this beautiful Indian girl with delicate features and a posh British accent. She looked like a Bollywood actress. Oh well.  I guess I know that when I'm single I'll at least get asked to the prom.  It is prom season now, after all. I guess that's why I'm so giddy while writing this.

\--------------------------------------------------

I unblocked Bev's husband and messaged him. I met up with him for coffee. Or what I assumed would be coffee. This man ordered an iced matcha latte like we were on a TikTok date.

He's a little older than I am. He works construction and is built like a pro football lineman, despite his beverage choices. We're only acquainted with each other due to our wives, so after some talk about surface level stuff, I asked him how he's doing with Bev.

He said he thought something was up because he would see her texting and laughing. He thought she might be having an emotional affair because she's always at home with their toddler.  She's not conventionally attractive, being around 100 pounds overweight, but her husband likes it that way. He was dreading confronting her about it but after getting my text he did.  

She confessed to it and basically living vicariously through it because Emily was talking about their fancy dates, Emily's spa trips, Hotel room service, John taking her to boutiques that don't have price tags on their items (cuz if you have to ask...). Every time Emily would cry and feel guilty, Bev admitted to encouraging her to have one last big fling of fun before settling down and becoming a (mostly) SAHM like her and telling her I'd divorce her if I found out (she's dead on right about that one). She deserved this, blah blah blah.  Basically being an enemy of our marriage.

Bev's husband rightfully figured that if Bev could do this, she could cheat on him.  He told Bev he was divorcing her.  But Bev put on the full court press, deleting her social media, blocking Emily, and swearing never to talk to her again. Full access to phone, computer, etc.  She booked therapy for them and paid for it by starting to work part time again (She's a nail tech.  Those people can make money hand over fist, y'all. You have no idea). Bev's husband consulted an attorney ($400. Ouch), and was basically told that he would lose a lot of money and she would probably get majority custody because what she did didn't constitute adultery or infidelity so it'd be a no fault divorce.

Since her only infraction was having my wife be her favorite reality TV show, Bev's husband decided to stay and work on the marriage because he didn't want to lose access to his son.  He showed me pictures and videos of the kid and let me tell you, I don't know anything about toddlers, but that is one cute kid so I understand. 

He said that Emily and Bev have not been in contact and Bev has deleted most of her social media and has a facebook account with only her family (mom, dad, siblings, in laws) on it.

He said he doesn't trust her as much any more and they're working on it.  He said that he respected me, but he wouldn't be able to respect himself and stay with a wife who did what mine did, especially if there were no kids involved. Thanks for the advice, buddy.

\----------------------------------------

We got an offer from Emily's new attorney.  Emily wanted another face to face meeting but I declined.  Let's just rapid fire our crap at each other and get this over with, Emily. I've had enough of her high end hooker identity crisis.  Here it is:

If Emily cheats again (emotionally, physically, digitally, or if she even thinks about sexting someone who uses cologne from Italy), I get 75% of our liquid assets, and half of her business profits for the past three years prior to the adultery, not exceeding $100K. (In all seriousness, there was a full legal dry boring definition of infidelity).

If I cheat, it's a no fault divorce and we split everything up 50-50. No alimony either way.

She'll pay for my attorney (and hers) out of her business profits and reimburse the $10K emergency fund.

Postnup becomes void if we stay together for 10 years without infidelity, which feels ambitious considering the first 10 years included the ""Erotic Saks Fifth Avenue Rewards Program"". If voided, both parties waive future claims to assets or alimony tied to this agreement.

Emily agrees to full financial disclosure, including bank statements, business financials, credit reports, and any business relationships with men named John, Jon, or Jean. Anyone named John Johnson or Jean Valjean invokes a double indemnity (kidding).  All financial disclosures will be kept with my lawyer or some other 3rd party of my choice.

Total mutual access to all electronic devices with no prior notice for 7 years. Any hidden or ""burner"" devices invoke the infidelity clause (followed by a dry description of ""undisclosed"" devices).

If we do divorce after this agreement, she waives all rights to spousal support unless I die tragically while doing something heroic, in which case she‚Äôs allowed to cry at the funeral (but not speak).

Weekly individual and couples counseling, minimum 12 months and paid by her, with a therapist selected by me and approved by the State Bar Association, the Vatican, and my group chat. Capped at $10K

No contact whatsoever with AP or any of his businesses. If a wedding happens at his venue, she sends one of her stylists instead. Or a goat. Whatever‚Äôs available.

All I have to do in order to exist in this proposed paradise is to stay married to the prettiest hooker in town!

My lawyer said it's a good deal and she doesn't know a judge that wouldn't enforce it (minus my sass, of course). She said if I was at all hesitant about not staying in the marriage, it's one of the best post nups she's seen as far as judicial enforceability goes.  Of course, any judge has a lot of latitude, but she said she couldn't see any judge throwing it out of court and she knows most of the judges around our area.

Just to be clear, I rejected it.  I told my lawyer that the bottom line is these are my non-negotiables: she has to agree to an at fault adultery divorce on the record, no alimony, I keep my 401K.  I would prefer for her to pay my attorney fees. Everything else is negotiable.

\-----------------------------------------

As far as everything outside of ""lawyer cage match"" goes, Lisa is still divorcing John.  Emily gave over her affidavit, which helped and she additionally offered to testify if needed.  John's penis must feel very depressed because the women he fucks really seem to savagely turn on him.  

Attend to HER needs first, sometimes, Johnny boy! Kegels, John. Do some Kegels. They help.

John's kids don't want to go visit him and he's trying to spin it that Lisa is deliberately alienating them.  If telling the truth is alienating, then I guess she's guilty.  Lisa is encouraging them to have a relationship with their father because, outside of him playing Johnny Appleseed with his semen, he's been a good supportive and attentive dad, attending their events and helping them with their studies, etc.

I'm not going into the details of what she's asking for, but let's say that if she gets what she's asking for (and I'm pretty sure she will), I'm very interested in offering my services as a sugar baby myself. Whatever a male sugar baby is. I'm not up on all the whore lingo.

MIL met me at my business and gave me more groceries, baked goods, and casseroles because ""casserole"" is her love language.  Emily was there but sat quietly in the back seat.  MIL told me that she let her come along ""just to see me"" and that if she said anything or got out of the car, she would lose all emotional support from her family.  I was wearing my wrangler slacks and a black t-shirt. Drink it in, Emily.

I was pissed at first, but ultimately grateful because my stomach didn't hurt as much seeing her. I think I'm getting over it all.

MIL and FIL are talking again, as predicted. They're both very disappointed and embarrassed at Emily's behavior.

Matt told me that his wife wanted squid sushi and a can of black olives, so the pregnancy is going strong.

Bob is starting to call off our DnD sessions in favor of hanging out with his special lady friend, which is unacceptable.  I'm going to use an AI video generator to make a video of her cheating on Bob so things get back to normal.

Jim is killing it at life, what with his pretty wife who doesn't fuck other dudes and his job and planned trip to Europe this fall.

My lawyer told me that if I want to expedite things, I should abandon my no contact policy and hand write Emily a letter explaining in detail why reconciliation is off the table. I think I'll have to do that.  I'll update in a couple of days with what I propose to send her.",97,1745606066.0,u_Any-Assault,65,0.99,False

I'd like to put together a high-end custom photo editing PC for my mom. She's gone through a really crushing few months and has little to cheer her up. She loves editing digital photos, and I'd venture doing so is her one intensely performance-demanding PC use case. I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions on a high-end build focusing on editing power and general every-day use cases (watching YouTube, email, word processing, etc.).

I have built personal gaming PCs from parts in the past, but I'm not familiar with the spec demands for editing software, so I hope to learn from your expertise. I would aim for \~$3500 for the PC parts, though realistically there's wiggle room in the budget. \~$1000 + significant wiggle room for one excellent main monitor focusing on color accuracy and high resolution (4K min.), +other features you think are worthwhile. If there's a particularly standout build/item/prebuilt which demands more, I'd love to hear about it. This rig will be Mom's primary entertainment/daily driver for the next several years, so I'd like it to be comfortable/exciting to use.

* **New build or upgrade?**

New

* **Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links)**

TV/Off-monitor: Existing (but basically unused) [Samsung QN32Q60AAF](https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/qled-4k-tvs/32-class-q60a-qled-4k-smart-tv-2021-qn32q60aafxza/shopapp/) 31.5"" diag 4K QLED Smart TV. HDMI, ethernet, coax.

Printer: Existing (but basically unused) [Canon Pixma TS9520](https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/pixma-ts9520?color=Black&type=New) printer/copier/scanner. USB, Wi-Fi, ethernet, Bluetooth 4.0, PictBridge.

* **PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games)**

Digital photo editing (primary demand), everyday mom-type uses (email, word processing, YouTube). Mom would like it to be at least competent at other tasks in case she develops new hobbies during the build's lifetime. She has primarily used the Adobe ecosystem (Photoshop specifically), but is open to other platforms.

* **Purchase country? Near Micro Center?**

In SF Bay Area, CA, USA. No Micro Centers nearby, but we have a local [Central Computers](https://www.centralcomputer.com).

* **Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)**

1x primary monitor needed. Prefer 4K+ resolution, \~31.5""-40"", exceptional color accuracy. Touchscreen OK (preferred but not required), stylus compatibility OK (not preferred, doesn't mind inclusion), adjustable stand angle OK (not preferred, doesn't mind inclusion).

Is burn-in with OLED screens a real danger? As she is, in fact, a mom, the recipient is known to leave her computer room for long periods with the screen on. Would appreciate your advice.

* **Budget range? (Include tax considerations)**

PC: \~$3500 base pre-tax. Would consider higher for exceptional performance increases.

Monitor: \~$1000, possibly $2000 for a truly exceptional main monitor.

Yes, we are aware of the tariff situation, but immediate need surpasses immediate cost.

* **WiFi or wired connection?**

Ethernet line is available, but would be nice to include Wi-Fi capability as an option.

* **Size/noise constraints?**

Prefer large tower with some HDD, PCIe expansion slot availability. Quiet cooling strongly preferred, but not absolutely necessary.

* **Color/lighting preferences?**

Mom-style. So long as performance isn't affected, please hold off on RGB, gimmick cases, and complex cooling solutions. Simple case colors preferred, EG black, white.

* **Any other specific needs?**

Prefer 1TB+ SSD boot disk with at least 8TB mass storage, with room for expansion in the future. Prefer performance over cost/performance within reason.

Please include 1x CD/DVD/BD drive. Must read CD/DVD at minimum. Prefer internal.

I'm not aware of any specific spec demands for mouse, keyboard, speakers in line with the above objectives, but please recommend anything you think would make the experience better for her. (She is known to spill tea and coffee on her keyboards at times.) These costs would be external to the above budget ranges.

Thank you for your time and consideration! I'd love to hear your opinions and learn from your experience.

This used to happen a lot when I was drinking. I‚Äôd call it the ‚Äò3 am horrors‚Äô ; I‚Äôd wake up, dehydrated, headache, feeling sick. I‚Äôd reflect on why I felt this way and would then suffer through to dawn. Anxiety, guilt, shame, anger, denial. I would promise myself today would be different and mark a new version of myself. All I had to do was get through the day. Then I would get until it was a socially acceptable hour to start drinking again and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do.
Not anymore. Sure, I‚Äôm awake and up now, but that‚Äôs an anomaly. Usually, when I wake at 3am I smile, roll over and fall back asleep. Today I decided to get up. I‚Äôll write this, make some coffee and meditate.
Giving up drinking is the best thing I ever did. I was 46 when I pulled the pin and have never looked back. I have  experienced all the major benefits that are well documented including better sleep, more energy, increased productivity and focus. But there has also been thousands of other things that I never would have imagined. Today I will celebrate all of the good things that have come rather than dwell on the challenges.
If you are considering sobriety ask yourself ‚Äòwhy?‚Äô If you‚Äôre answer is because you think you may have a problem, consider this; if you have an inner dialogue that goes something like ‚ÄòI think I might be drinking too much‚Äô ‚Äònah!

Last September she apologised to me and said she had stopped drinking alcohol for 3 years now and that she‚Äôd like to start a relationship with me. 

However her apology came 2 weeks before I was set to leave the country on a gap year. She wasn‚Äôt aware of this because of the fact we had been going non contact. 

In that time we haven‚Äôt really been texting or calling. 

I‚Äôm finding it difficult to restart a relationship with her. 

However I‚Äôm finding it hard to admit it but I‚Äôm feeling a lot of resentment towards her now. 

I have returned back to England now twice. In that time I‚Äôve asked if we can meet. And she‚Äôs been acting strange both times. Even on Christmas Day, she arrived late and told me while I was making dinner that she would be leaving after dinner just to meet with her friend. She tried to make it a joke but I found it so hard. 

Then when I went back home last time I went to my room to put my stuff away. My tv was missing. I live with my grandparents so I asked what had happened. They told me they didn‚Äôt want to make me upset. But my mum had came in the house when they hadn‚Äôt been there (she has the keys, they haven‚Äôt changed the lock in years) and took my tv. 

I was so hurt by this. I feel so stupid because in reality it is just a tv and I wasn‚Äôt even using it. But I think when my mum apologised I had assumed I was going to get a mum of my dreams again but that isn‚Äôt the case of course. 

My grandma had a word from her. I saw my mums face when I walked in and realised she knew she messed up. She gave it back immediately. 

I don‚Äôt really know where to go from here. I want to have a relationship with my mum but I don‚Äôt know how to make it easier. 

I feel sad because I see others around me who have so much support from their mums. They offer them lifts, help them with problems, offer emotional support, give advice on problems like job applications and things like this. 

I was considering maybe suggesting we go for coffee once a month or something and discuss how we feel. I feel like she apologised and I was so in shock I never said anything about how I feel and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm never gonna give this relationship a try and regret it later. 

Tldr: I am back in contact with my mum after 7 years and don‚Äôt know how to restart a relationship with her. Looking for ideas to cope and to make things easier between us. ",1,1745605775.0,family,2,1.0,False

I had my first bout of gout in Feb. Nasty enough I couldn't bear to wait five days to see my PCP, so I went to an in network civilian urgent care 5 minutes away, got X-rays and a prescription for a steroid all at zero cost to me. Went to my PCP appt and got a blood test for uric acid that unsurprisingly (given the recent steroid) showed normal uric acid levels. PCP advised to give it a little time and lots of nsaids to see if it resolved.

Sent a secure message yesterday, got a same day callback from PCP who authorized another set of X-rays and another uric acid blood test. Assuming my uric acid levels are high, he'll have a prescription sent.

So today I drove 30 minutes to my modern, very clean and friendly VA center. First dropped by optometry to see if they could adjust the brand new glasses that I received a couple of weeks ago. (transition + progressive lenses) They had just left for lunch, so she put me on the list. I walked over to radiation and ten minutes later walked out after X-rays. Walked ten feet to get the blood test and again walked out in under ten minutes. I still had ten minutes to kill, so I got a free, not very good cup of coffee from a volunteer then sat down outside of optometry. Within 5 minutes of the end of their lunch, I got my new glasses adjusted with a better pair of nose pads added. Drove home and entered my mileage online for partial reimbursement.

How does it get better than that, short of house calls?

My only quibble might be that the redundant X-rays feel a little wasteful. I assume that it may just be easier to take another set than to get copies from the civilian side, but perhaps my PCP has a valid medical reason to want to see them now that the massive flare up has calmed down to merely annoying. 

There are lots of ways to get hurt on the job, but if you are going to, I know of no better place than the military to do so.

How can you listen to ""Espresso Macchiato"" and NOT hear the blatant, CHEAP knock-off of Al Pacino's iconic (and I use that word loosely) Dunkaccino commercial from the cinematic TRAVESTY that was *Jack and Jill*?!

Seriously, the ""less bitter, more glitter"" vibe? The awkward celebrity endorsement *feeling* of the whole thing? It's like Tommy Cash watched Al Pacino desperately shilling that coffee drink in a Sandler movie and thought, ""Yeah, I can rip *that* off and call it art!""

Don't even try to tell me it's just a ""vibe"" or a ""coincidence."" This isn't some subtle influence; it's like he directly plugged into the cringe energy of that commercial and vomited it out as a song! The man's practically doing a bad Al Pacino impression through autotune!

We're supposed to celebrate this as some kind of avant-garde masterpiece? It's not avant-garde; it's creatively BANKRUPT! It's the musical equivalent of finding a half-eaten Dunkin' donut in the trash and trying to sell it as a gourmet pastry!

I'm genuinely disgusted. Tommy Cash, you're better than this... or at least, I *thought* you were. This isn't quirky; it's lazy. It's not artistic; it's theft of comedic energy from a movie that should be buried and forgotten!

Wake up, people! Stop pretending this is original! It's Dunkaccino with a beat! It's *Jack and Jill* in song form! And it's an insult to anyone with a shred of artistic integrity (and anyone who had to suffer through *Jack and Jill*)!

# üîç What is Java Burn & How Does It Work?

**Java Burn** is a **fat burning coffee powder** that blends invisibly into your morning cup. It supports fat loss, energy, and focus‚Äîall without adding calories.

It claims to **increase metabolism naturally** by working with your coffee‚Äôs caffeine, not against it. Think of it as a co-pilot, not a replacement.

Unlike pills or flavored drinks, this is a **healthy coffee enhancer** that won‚Äôt mess with your brew. It doesn‚Äôt clump, doesn‚Äôt float, and doesn‚Äôt judge your coffee habits.

This isn‚Äôt just one of the **best supplements to mix with coffee**, it might be the only one you‚Äôll finish the pouch off without regret.

It‚Äôs marketed as a **coffee metabolism booster supplement** that makes your cup do more than just wake you up. And it actually follows through.

# üë§ Personal Experience with Java Burn (from Lisa)

Lisa and I used to share a co-working space back when I was freelancing full-time‚Äîshe‚Äôs a freelance UX designer and full-blown coffee snob with a side hustle teaching yoga.

We bonded over burnt espresso shots and long rants about slow metabolism after 30.

She was the one who nudged me [toward Java Burn](https://theworldhealth.org/morning-coffee-ritual-official). ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a miracle,‚Äù she warned, ‚Äúbut it *does* help me stay out of the snack drawer between client calls.‚Äù

Lisa started mixing **Java Burn** into her morning pour-over during a particularly intense stretch of back-to-back deadlines.

After about four days, she noticed her energy stayed more even‚Äîno 3 p.m. crashes, and her usual impulse to stress-eat a granola bar? MIA.

She didn‚Äôt change anything else‚Äîsame yoga classes, same avocado toast obsession‚Äîbut over the next month, she said her leggings started feeling just a bit looser. Nothing drastic, just a steady shift.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve lost weight without feeling like I was punishing myself,‚Äù she said, which coming from Lisa, is high praise.

Her only gripe? On mornings she skipped breakfast (usually after a late night prototyping marathon), it made her feel a bit too wired. Once she paired it with even a small snack, things leveled out fast.

So yeah‚Äîreal person, real coffee, real results.

# ‚úÖ Pros and Cons

üî¥ Not ideal for people who avoid caffeine entirely  
üî¥ No local stores carry it‚Äîonline orders only

# üß¨ Ingredients Breakdown

Let‚Äôs talk ingredients. Java Burn keeps it clean with a short **ingredients list**‚Äîno mystery blends, no lab experiments.

[Key players include](https://theworldhealth.org/morning-coffee-ritual-official) **green tea extract (EGCG)**, **chlorogenic acid**, **L-theanine**, **L-carnitine**, **chromium**, and **vitamins B6 & B12**.

Together, they form a **daily supplement for energy and metabolism** that feels like fuel‚Äînot fire.

# üéØ Who Java Burn Is For (And Who It‚Äôs Not)

It‚Äôs perfect if you already drink coffee and want to **boost metabolism with your morning brew**‚Äîwithout adding another pill to your routine.

If you're after a **metabolism booster without jitters**, though, you‚Äôll want to pair it with food. Caffeine still hits hard on an empty stomach.

Most **Java Burn customer reviews** say the same: consistent use leads to fewer cravings and better energy. It's not flashy. It just works gradually.

Real talk: don‚Äôt expect dramatic **before and after** photos in a week. But if you‚Äôre playing the long game, it‚Äôs a strong support act.

One reviewer said it helped them **burn fat faster by making coffee more effective**, and that matches what Lisa and I noticed too.

It's a popular **coffee fat burner supplement** without any of the usual chemical nonsense.

# üßØ How to Use It (Properly)

Use one packet a day, ideally with hot coffee and a little food. It dissolves fast and plays nice with any roast‚Äîlight, dark, or ""I slept three hours.""

It's [super convenient](https://theworldhealth.org/morning-coffee-ritual-official) and definitely one of the **best weight loss powders to mix with coffee** ... it actually delivers on its promise. Skip the food and it might punch a little too hard.

Wondering **how to make coffee burn fat faster**? Stir in Java Burn consistently, stay active, and don‚Äôt chase it with a muffin the size of your head.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Side Effects & Safety Notes

Let‚Äôs keep it real. There *are* possible **Java Burn side effects**‚Äîmainly jitters or a slight crash if you‚Äôre sensitive or forget to eat.

That said, most users who already drink coffee daily are fine. Just don't chug it like a frat boy with pre-workout and you‚Äôll be good.

# üí∏ Pricing Options

* **1 pouch (30-day supply):** $69
* **3 pouches:** $117 ($39 each)
* **6 pouches:** $204 ($34 each)

Two hundred thousand weighed my name‚Äî  
A quiet burden, loud with shame.

I stood alone‚Äîno hand to hold,  
Just grit and fire, fierce and bold.  
A single woman, strong and wise,  
With dreams that stretched beyond the skies.

Two hundred thousand shadows cast,  
But not one ghost of debt could last.  
Each dollar earned, each check I wrote,  
A battle cry, a victory note.

I watched the numbers slowly fall,  
Each one a scratch upon the wall.  
Until today‚Äîthe final sum,  
The mortgage paid, the war now won.

No lender's call, no interest bite,  
No sleepless staring into night.  
The deed is mine, the home, the air‚Äî  
I plant my flag, I take my chair.

At fifty years, I raise my glass  
To every storm I let just pass.  
To all the quiet strength I grew,  
And all the power I never knew.

I sip my coffee, slow and proud,  
No worry lurking in the cloud.  
The chains are dust, the fear is gone,  
I built this peace, I carried on.

This home is mine, the walls, the floor,  
The peace that lives behind the door.  
I built this life from sweat and grace‚Äî  
A sacred, debt-free, fearless place.

Ive been fired a 3 times, but every other job i just left a few months in because after a while of working someplace, i begin to literally have suicidal ideations on my way to work. and I cannot tolerate spending my time doing something that literally makes me want to die. so i just quit. 
of the 12 jobs ive worked, theres been a really wide variety of jobs - office job (dispatch, logistics), retail, food service (bakery, fast food, fancy), makers space, farmers market (best job if my life but i got fired because the owner of the shop was genuinely crazy), coffee shop. i am yet to find a job that i dont loathe. 
anyways, i finally got a job i thought i could handle; tutoring on my college campus. 
Flexible and minimal hours, and a lot of downtime to do whatever i want while im not actively tutoring. 
even so, im constantly late to my shifts, and sometimes I just dont show up to my shift without notice or even telling them at all.
such an easy, laid back job. and i still cant muster the ability to be, at the very least, reliable and on time. I just got told that since my attendance is unreliable, i dont get any more shifts until further notice. i have to have a meeting with my boss to discuss what is going on. im sure theyll give me a second chance, but i am just so absolutely ashamed of myself for fucking up this really easy and low stress job. 
i dont know what the hell is wrong with me. i just dont care about work, at all. sometimes i dont even submit my time sheet. idk why, like i WANT to get paid.
its not that i hate *doing work* - im a stem student with straight A‚Äôs, and i wouldnt mind doing labor as long as it somehow enriched and benefited my own life or my community. but working for someone else‚Äôs business that has absolutely no benefit to me quickly becomes soul sucking. 
and also, because of my horrible track record with jobs, i cant use any of my previous employers as references for future applications because i just know they will not have good things to say. i am a horrible employee. 
does anyone else struggle with this? any advice would be greatly appreciated. i feel so defeated and incompetent. i know capitalism is not built to serve the working class, and basically everyone hates their job and hates working. but people still do it. why cant i just suck it up and  be responsible like everyone else?

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

I pointed it out asking if we are ok and told him I've noticed a shift. He said he has a lot on his plate, is stressed, he's dealing with his stuff his own way which is compartmentalizing. I'm important to him and right now the relationship is in the back of the line for the moment of attention. He has some big issues with his adult kids.

He said we are good and it has nothing to do with us. He went from I love yous first to just emoji heart if I say it. I'm starting to feel like a fool for chasing him. He always told me from the start I dont' want a broken version of him. He would get help. But he hasn't. It's been non stop cycle about his kids and they treat him like garbage. But he caves to them so it never stops. Again, I'm supportive, patient, try to let him know it's not his fault, etc. But he caves/backpeddles with them and gives in to them. But again, not my issue. Just sad.

I believe I did nothing wrong. I do know he loves me but this message about compartmentalizing and back of the line for a moment made me read between the lines that he doesn't want a relationship. Which he told me in a panic he didn't. But then after he said that he went full steam lovey. Then a fight with his kids which caused him to be distant. 

So I spent all night crying knowing I have to let him go. He won't break up with me outright but i feel that was his way of telling me. He also can't let go of the fact that he likes me and wants to talk with me. We talk 2-3 times a day every day. We barely see each other due to our schedule, which is fine. But with this pull back he made no mention of getting together. When I asked what is he doing, he mentioned a project. Before, he would say seeing me. So clearly he didn't want to see me. That's why I asked him what's going on and got that response. Dummy me told him I'm in the area on a certain day if he wants to get together. But that was before I cried my eyes out from 4-6am about he obviously is telling me he doesn't want me (I'm anxious attached).

He just texted that meeting up on that day for coffee is ok. I'm like coffee? Really? Come on. Forget it. I said ""nah it's ok."" He said no come why go home. I said nah it's ok. I'm slow but I get what he was saying yesterday (the back of the line). And he said no come. I said why. He said why not. I said I'm confused and sent him his text about back of the line. He didn't respond but deflected about his kid causing an issue (which is always happening). 

He feels I'm overthinking us. How can I be overthinking? He tells me that he doesn't know if or when he wants a relationship.

He's confused. He likes me. Says he loves me. Misses me. Talked about some future stuff. We get along beyond words. My feeling for him is he is finally my person. I have seen cracks in him where he obviously does love me and is trying hard to go with it but then gets scared and retreats--repeatedly. After 4 months I'm calling him out on it. 

He seriously doesn't understand why I'm confused. He sees it as overthinking. How am I overthinking when I'm told that the relationship is not a priority. He emotionally pulled back. Doesn't even apologize for it anymore but tells me flat out he's stressed and has a lot going on (I have wayyyy more stressful things going on. His is a repeating topic. Mine is a total constant new issue shitstorm). What am I supposed to think? I told him I wanted to respect what he asked for and I have no idea what to do. 

I am anxiously attached but I also know what I want. I want him. I want to move forward. Slow paced is totally fine. Inconsistent and flip flopping is not. Now it's getting really bad emotional hot/cold and it's affecting me greatly. I'm crying HARD for hours. I get entirely depressed for the day. He even told me a few times he has no idea where this will go. I'm not asking for marriage! I'm asking progress and then I can feel secure and take it day by day until my life is more stable and then see where he's at. My own kid sees my distress and is sick of me hurting.

So is he flipping the script by saying I'm overthinking and he will use it as a ""you know, this is too stressful"" and end it? Why does he want to talk to me or have me around? He knows what I want. I have obsessively asked chatgpt for help and essentially it said he's FA, loves me, but is no way showing up so let him go and dont' look back. I struggle hard with that. But I was getting confident about letting him go 5 min ago and now he's all ""come and have coffee"", you're overthinking, we are good. And now I'm back to being confused but sick of crying over him. He doesn't understand how he affects me. He knows what I want and I feel like a complete fool for staying and him wanting to continue to talk with me. WTF is he doing???

As much as I can be a bag of energy, I am like a Cheetah. I dash and then I'm pooped and need some quiet. I like quiet mornings sometimes where I will bring a stack of books with my food and coffee and make a little spot on my porch or on my couch and read and eat and take my time. 

I sometimes wonder what our mornings will look like together. Sometimes I imagine putting on some tunes while we get stuff moving for the day. Sometimes I imagine you joining me while I do my workouts or a yoga routine for the day. Sometimes I imagine us sitting there going down a rabbit hole of memes and videos and laughing really hard until we fall back asleep. 

I love the idea of having some good tunes going in the morning. I always loved hearin' what you had to show me. You'll just have to be patient 'cause you are the lyric masta.

Most of the common suggestions don't work in my case. I can't talk to anyone there as nobody is talkative; many of them don't want to speak at all, regardless of language or experiences or anything. There's often a 3-hour period where not a word of conversation is uttered by anyone on the entire factory floor (including two assembly lines and a testing area). There were only two people who wanted to hold a conversation there, and they both quit two weeks ago.

We're highly micromanaged and don't get to choose our own break times or spots to sit in, we can't have any food on the factory floor (no snacks) or even refill water/coffee/tea until our breaktimes. We can take bathroom breaks if they're short, but other than that we are not allowed to move from our stations until the end of the night.

We can't look at our phones during the shift except on breaks, wear headphones or earbuds, or play music through our phone speakers. Bringing a portable radio *might* be possible (I'll ask next week).

The most I can do is choose whether I stand or sit (although most of the work requires sitting), push my chair from one side of my table to the other, sip water (has to last me 3 hours per refill, so slowly), and go to the bathroom.

To top it all off, the work comes at an agonizing pace that is too slow to get into a flow and too fast to zone out and take mental breaks. Generally, I'll get something that takes 15 seconds to do every 30 seconds. Also if one of the production lines finishes their daily quota before the day's out, there is an endless supply of ""prepwork"" and other busywork to keep us occupied as the manager does not want anyone to be ""idling"". So even if we finish our work early, there's endless fake work waiting. Last week I spent an hour manually checking parts that I had already confirmed were good before, they just handed me a box of 500 pieces that had already been checked and I checked it again.

I'm seriously at my wit's end here. This job is crushing my soul. I don't even have the energy to apply to anything else on my off days because I'm so burnt out.

This isn't even mentioning the physical issues; my feet are soaking in their own sweat in my steeltoes which causes a ton of skin issues despite trying to wear moisture-wicking socks, and I don't have enough room to even wiggle my toes which gets oppressive. My shoulders are killing me from repetitive strain, and I have to spend half of both my breaks going to the very back of the building (by the loading docks) where my locker is to get some hand lotion so my skin stops cracking. We have to wear these cheap ESD straps that need to be pulled so tight they dig in and irritate. The air in there is full of dust that makes my nose just that little bit irritated, and because there's irritants used in the production process it's very hard to get the chance to scratch your face or anything.

The management/supervision is also nasty. Not a big deal, but when there's already so many annoyances going on, it starts to upset me.

Any help? I'm seriously dying out here. I've been here a few weeks already, seen all the good conversationalists quit, but I have nowhere to go back to other than this (coming from a highly abusive home environment in a city where rent is prohibitively high). I don't see myself getting used to this at all; the tedium and discomfort is *killing me.* The pay here isn't even that good (1.3x minimum wage) but the job market is so bad right now there's not anything else I can do. I have an associates and a bachelors, both in STEM, and have sent over 350 applications out just since mid-November yet have gotten nothing. I've hired private career coaches and used my university's career services, gone to job fairs and networking events, reached out to everyone I know in industry, and there's just nothing. The market is bone dry unless you're an experienced professional wanting to work for below-newcomer rates - like literally taking what new grads are historically supposed to make, slashing it by 20%, and then only accepting people whose experience should be earning them double that.

Sometimes after maybe 1 hour playing I'm so bored I start to fall asleep with the controller in my hands, I can't get through 1 gaming session without having to drink coffee to just not fall asleep.

I really want to like this game, but I haven't found a single thing I like besides the visuals and maybe some of the story.

It's incredibly simplistic, I don't feel that my combos substantially improve, my skill tree is basic af and there's not a lot of things to do to improve Clive, you only use Clive so I also don't feel there's any strategy like at all in fights, my magic is limited and can't be spammed so you end up just hitting with the sword while waiting for the magic to refill, everything feels limited and slow. Eikon battles are also super boring and feel more like a chore with quick time events than gameplay, I would've preferred to have cutscenes instead, at least that way I could just let go of the controller and just inmerse myself in the visuals.
I'm already in the ""Clive is Sid"" part of the story and tbh I don't feel my character has grown like at all, I've learned at most 2-3 skills with skill points because skills are freaking expensive and you get almost no skill points from battle.

In general it feels like a very simple and boring game. I might just watch the rest of the story on YT and stop playing, I'm dreading having to play this game TWICE to get the platinum and that's not a good sign. Most of the games I've played in the last 10 years I wouldn't mind playing them twice, but not this one.
I don't get to choose my party to make it balanced, I can't decide if I should be a paladin or a mage for strategy, the world is all a single straight line of going from point A to B, with nothing to really do but kill monsters that are useless and easy and you can beat by spamming ‚¨õ 

I've been killed once, and that happened because I was so bored in a fight I wanted to just move on and I started spamming square, the enemy grew 2 new arms and replenished their hp and I died after an attack.

Side note: The OST from the hideout is a straight up ripoff of zoras domain OST

I spent 10 years in the datacenter on the customer side. Went to big virtualization company for almost 8 before I was laid off after their acquisition- you can guess which one, I'm sure. Did post-sales and pre-sales. 

After my layoff, I got a new gig a couple months later at one of the big cybersecurity vendors. It is a lot different than I was used to, but I also enjoyed the new challenge. One F20 whitespace account in our ""Global"" segment. My rep and I managed to close a 10-figure deal to establish a foothold. Turns out- I really enjoy competing in a whitespace environment where you start from scratch. Nothing wrong with farming, but I do like the hunt! I was nervous about it ahead of time, but I actually really enjoyed it. 

A month or so back, a rep from my previous company called me up and asked about a competitor of ours. We are still really good friends and meet up regularly for lunch. We went back and forth a bit until he asked me the real question- would I have any interest in coming over with him as a package deal. AE and SE roles are both growth roles. I am pretty happy where I am, but after my layoff- I was scarred. I loved that company and in the end, ""it's a business decision"" and a 2 minute phone call was all I got. Well, and severance. So I figured why not- I'll interview, make some new connections, learn some things about my competitor and how they see us, etc. 

Turns out it was a blast. Really connected with the recruiter and SE Mgr. Breezed through the two technical rounds and really appreciated their process. None of the, ""what port and protocol..."" trivia questions. Just honest technical questions about experiences, challenges, architecture/design, etc. Got to the panel interview. I used ChatGPT to help me prepare in this area (happy to go into detail if wanted) and 30 mins after the meeting- got an email from the hiring manager telling me I crushed it. Met with his VP- solid guy, very little talk about work, mostly just a vibe check, goals, personal life, NFL draft predictions, etc. 

Sales Director also reached out. He listened in on my presentation and wanted to meet for coffee. We got along great, he gave me a lot of compliments on my presentation style. Kept the ""nerd knobs"" to a minimum, focused on the business value and outcomes the customer could achieve, handled some obstructionist questions well, circled back when we had some time to probe a bit deeper on a question, etc. 

One thing I asked him was had he helped foster any SE->AE transitions in his career. I appreciated his honesty... he had, but it works out maybe 50% of time in his experience. I told him that was a path I was wanting to explore in my career. He was honest and said he would never promise anything if he didn't think I was right for the role down the road, but he would gladly accept my request to be more involved on the AE side and get exposed to it so I could see if it was something I was a fit for. He closed the coffee meeting with the ""ask for the deal"" method lol... ""but you are perfect for this SE role, and we really want you to come over."" Who doesn't love hearing that? Guy is a pro. 

Got the verbal and written yesterday. Pretty juicy jump in OTE. Typical enterprise patch. All whitespace, just like I like ha. And a comp plan to support logo acquisition mode. 

It is a competitor so I do wonder how to maintain credibility of ""Yeah yeah- I said X was the best. Now I'm saying it's Y!"" but, I'll figure that out. This competitor does have some distinct advantages in my opinion (and some disadvantages) so I'll just do what I always do- stay positive, focus on strengths, and build relationships.

If it evolves into something else, cool. If not...no worries. That is not my goal here. My goal is human connection.

You can be any age, really. Just be open-minded and kind.
