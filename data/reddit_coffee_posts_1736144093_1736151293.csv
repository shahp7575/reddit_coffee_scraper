I was searching the boards for decaf recommendations and noticed a lot of comments about having a hard time dialing it in or it being a hassle to find the right grind setting. I’m genuinely curious what’s the difference in these things with caffeinated and decaf beans? I will never be brewing caffeinated, I can’t have it for various health reasons and no one else in my house is a coffee drinker. 

I bought the Fellow Opus and Casabrews CM5418 (upgrading towards end of year). 

Any website/video recommendations for anything espresso related is greatly appreciated! This is a hobby I’ve wanted to do for a VERY long time and just never thought it was something actually obtainable at home!",1,1736150828.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I have my espresso machine for less than a month and am a beginner to espresso making. So far I wasn’t able to get nice espresso and I’m about to lose my mind, throw the thing out of the window and get back to my mocca pot and aeropress.

Im using a Lelit Anna 2 with PID and a Baratza Encore ESP. I’m brewing around 94 C and use a dark roast (I had 2 since, a supermarket Lavazza and a small roasters bag of beans).

I tried doses between 14g and 20g, but prefer 16 or 18g. I tried the 14-18g “lelit by IMS” basket that came with the machine and the no-name basket that came with the lelit bottomless portafilter, I think it’s a tripple dose filter, it’s bigger than the IMS.

So I start with a coarse grind and work my way up to finer grinds, aiming for a 1:2 ratio in 30 seconds. 

The problem I have is that with this recipe I get very sour coffee. The coffee this morning was 16g in the IMS basket, 38 seconds and 32g out and it was still very sour. The puck after looks okay I have occasionally small pimple craters which could be channels but I don’t find a consistent relationship between those and faster pulls and sourness.

If I grind much finer I will get non sour coffee at times around a minute. If I grind coarser I will get faster shots but they still stay sour or get more sour. So im not sure it’s clearly channeling.

I use filtered water and tried unfiltered (very hard) water but the result was not significant.

Does anyone have any ideas and advice? ",1,1736150716.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Sorry for the rambling, I'm just in a bit of a slump/funk, anyone wanna chat about nothing and everything ? How's 2025 going for you so far ?","Hi, nearly 31 year old male from Australia here. Just in a new years slump, actually, been a few months now. Life is in slow motion. I work, I sleep, I eat, I do life admin shit, and then the next day appears. 

I've been really lazy lately. Not sure what I'm looking for. Maybe just an ear to complain to, or someone to talk to. I need to get back into the gym and pursuing my hobbies. Easier said than done. 

Life is getting a bit stale post 30 years old. Maybe I'm just disillusioned.

What's the last book you read cover to cover? I used to read a lot in highschool. I think mine was 'The Old Man and The Sea' by Ernest Hemingway in 2021. It wasn't too long, maybe took me a week or two to finish. I want to start reading novels again. I have a stack of books that are gathering dust. I am generally aimless when it comes to life. Recently I've been feeling very listless, a bit bored, and despondent of things in general and I don't know why. 

A bit about me: 

* I prefer tea over coffee first thing in the morning.
* I hate running but at one point in time I could do a sub 25 min 5K. I am now severely unfit.
* I have two degrees in the hard sciences but now work in IT.
* I want to produce music one day, mainly house/electronic/EDM. But mainly house music. 
* I have a hard time keeping myself accountable to myself. Hit me up if you're looking for an accountability partner.
* I have a prominent scar on the back of my right hand.

A bit about you:

* Somewhat disillusioned with life (just like me !)
* Male or female, I really don't mind !
*  Similar timezone to me would be nice :) I am in GMT+10
* A love for music and the arts would be appreciated

I am happy to trade pictures of myself and eventually move to another platform like Signal or WhatsApp. Also just to point out - I am NOT looking for anything nsfw or any lewd chats.

Long story short, we're both 26 now, we've been friends since we were in 8th grade, became best friends, grew very close by senior year of high school, dated on and off throughout college, got back together in 2020 and did long distance for 3 years due to my job and his grad school. In February we went ""on a break"" due to the distance, but we still talked every single day, said I love you, and I still visited our hometown to see him every other month. So even though we technically broke up, nothing changed and it didn't feel like we did at all. Then in September one of his friends from grad school, who he's been pretty close with the last two years, confessed feelings and they loosely started seeing each other even though we still were hooking up and talking all the time. I moved back home on Thanksgiving and told him I wanted to make it work, do this for real and finally be together in the same place. No more long distance. We hooked up, said I love you, then he said my moving home ""changed everything"" and he needed space to process and figure out what he wanted because now this other girl was in the picture but he wasn't as attracted to her. I told him I was serious and committed and waited for an answer. Two weeks ago we met up, got coffee, kissed and he said he needed more time. I didn't hear from him the last two weeks, then he called me and said he and the friend from grad school decided to start a relationship on new years, which was 8 days after I last saw him. 

I feel like I lost the person I was going to spend the rest of my life with. We grew up through every major phase of life together. He wasn't just a partner, but my best friend. How do you move on from that? Does it get easier?

I’m 25F and I got off hormonal birth control about seven months ago. I’m not sure if it’s related to my acne but I think it’s likely. I’ve had acne since I was a teen. Last year I used differin adapalene gel for about five months and it helped with some of the breakouts, but I stopped using it as it seemed to be making my hyperpigmentation worse and it was causing a lot of sensitivity and irritation to my skin (dryness, burning, itchiness, flaking). 

My current routine:

AM - CeraVe salicylic acid wash, CeraVe moisturizing cream and lotion

PM - CeraVe salicylic acid wash, CeraVe moisturizing cream and lotion. Every two to three days I use Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant. If I’m wearing makeup, I start my evening routine by using The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm. 

I pretty regularly use aloe to help with redness, and pimple patches for blemishes and to keep me from picking. I only wear foundation and blush maybe once a week, I use Clinique concealer for spots several times a week. 

I change my pillow case every two to three days, change my sheets every week, wash my face twice a day every day without fail, and I avoid excess dairy (just half and half in my coffee) and sugar. I do drink alcohol once a week on average.

I have ventured into other lines (Curology, Proactiv, Neutrogena, Eminence) but none seemed to work long term. They’d help for a month or two and then my skin would go back to the usual.

How Activated Charcoal Teeth Whitening Powder Works

Activated charcoal is not your ordinary charcoal. This specially processed form of carbon is incredibly porous and has amazing absorption properties. When used in teeth whitening, the **activated charcoal powder** works through a unique mechanism:

• Adsorption of Stains: The highly porous surface attracts and binds to:
- Coffee and tea stains
- Wine discolorations
- Tobacco stains
- Plaque and bacteria

Key Benefits of Activated Charcoal Teeth Whitening

1. Natural Whitening Process
Unlike chemical-based whitening treatments, activated charcoal teeth whitening powder offers a completely natural approach to brightening your smile. The fine, highly absorbent powder gently removes surface stains without damaging tooth enamel.

1hutteg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hutteg/im_starting_to_think_that_the_beach_hates_me/,I’m Starting to Think That the Beach Hates Me,"I was convinced to take a trip to the beach for the end-of-year festivities. Lately, I haven't felt much like going back to the coast, but my friends got together, booked the place and paid in advance, preventing me from saying no. We went in two groups, in my car, which I finally managed to buy last month and I was even afraid to take it on the road, it was me, my girlfriend Karla, William and his girlfriend, Sibila. The other group had Fred and Sam, a couple, James, a friend I had recently made, and another William, a friend of James's, who we didn't know very well. They went by bus, at different times, and the first to arrive were James and William.

We arrived shortly after and started unpacking our stuff. Since it was already night, we decided to leave our bags and go look for something to eat, walking along the sand in the hope of finding a beachfront restaurant that was still open.

It was on the way back that I realized how isolated the house we were staying in was. It was close to the sea, but far from the city, on a side street with little traffic, and, if I remember correctly, with no neighbors for at least two blocks, in the opposite direction from the beach. The place was old, and not necessarily poorly maintained, but you could tell that the owners only stopped by before renting it out to give it a little cleaning. That must be why the rent was so cheap.

We spent some time outside, chatting, some smoking cigarettes and others smoking something more “interesting”, and the girls went inside to take a shower and finish making the beds.

The living room was quite large, with worn wooden walls and a ceiling fan that made a low, constant noise. There was an equally large kitchen, a bathroom and only one bedroom. We had all decided to sleep in the living room, since it would be more spacious.

Fred, the two Williams and James were at the entrance to the house, exchanging work stories and laughing, while I watched through the door as the girls arranged the air mattresses on the floor.

– Hey, Alex, did you guys get your mattress?

– What mattress?

Sibila pointed to the corner.

– Mine is here, yours and Karla’s are over there, and Sam’s is over there – She pointed to the mattresses on the floor – But there are only four more. Weren’t there five?

There was silence. Karla looked at me, raising an eyebrow, and started counting on her fingers.

– No, each of you brought your own, there were eight, right? One for each… – I answered, shooting a confused look at Sibila.

– Yeah, but there’s one missing... – She cut off the sentence in the middle, putting her hands on her hips and turning her head down, with an equally confused look.

I focused, trying to remember how we organized the bags in the car. Nothing was missing when we unloaded. I was sure of that.

– I see those drinks had taken effect – I said jokingly.

– It must still be in the car, or you guys left it somewhere.

– We didn’t, Si. We unloaded everything together. – Karla answered her from the other corner of the room. They both looked at me as if they were waiting for an answer.

A wave of discomfort took over the room. It wasn't just because of the mattress itself, it was as if we knew something wasn't right, but no one wanted to talk about it.

Outside, I heard William (the “Big” William as we called him to differentiate) laughing in a very loud tone, the way we were used to.

\- I'll go and see with the boys. – I said, heading towards the door.

Outside, the air was fresh, and the conversation was accompanied by laughter and the smell of cigarettes being put out in the improvised ashtray. Fred looked at me as I walked out the door.

\- What gives? – He asked, noticing the expression on my face.

\- There's a mattress missing in there. Are you sure you got everything?

James frowned and put out his joint on the wall.

– Of course we did, I checked the bags with you, remember?

Fred shrugged and made a funny face.

– These mattresses are all the same, and you're all high as a kite. Maybe they're all stacked or something.

The “Other” William (James' friend), who had been quiet until then, pointed to the couch that was outside, near the door.

– Isn't it that one over there?

On top of the couch, thrown haphazardly, was a blue air mattress, just like the others, still rolled up.

I went over to pick it up, but something seemed... strange. Was it there the whole time? Why hadn't anyone seen it before? I shook my head, pushing the thought away.

Fred laughed and patted me on the shoulder.

– See? Problem solved. Now go in there and tell the girls they're paranoid.

I went into the living room and started inflating the mattress with the air pump.

– There it is. Some idiot forgot it on the couch.

She didn't seem completely convinced, but accepted the explanation with a sigh. Once it was inflated, it was placed next to the others and covered with a sheet. Everything seemed to be sorted.

But as I left the room to join the mess outside, I couldn't shake a bad feeling from my mind: I was sure we had brought everything inside the house.

Eventually, the girls appeared outside with three glasses of drinks in their hands.

The house had an outdoor area set up with a grill, a small table and a sofa. We also set up our beach chairs and started playing cards to pass the time.

– Who wants to play one? – Fred said, handing me the cards to shuffle as if he had already decided that I would play.

– I'm in! – ""Big"" William replied.

Fred raised an eyebrow to the left corner of the room.

– You too, William? – I turned to the right corner, looking for the answer, but froze for a second when I heard it coming from the other side of the table.

– Of course.

My gaze followed Fred's, and I saw the “Other” William nodding casually.

– It's going to be confusing with so many Williams at the table, – Sam commented in an ironic tone.

– It's always been confusing, – I joked, trying to lighten the mood.

– Hey, I haven't even played yet and I'm already being accused! – replied “Big” William, laughing.

I started to shuffle and deal the cards, trying to ignore the strangeness of the situation, but before I could finish, Karla leaned over to pick up her glass from the edge of the table and raised an eyebrow.

– Hey, William, weren't you sitting right next to me?

Everyone looked at the seat next to her. It was empty.

– Yes, I was. I just got myself a beer. Want one? – said “Big” William, raising the can.

Karla turned her head, following the words.

– No, it wasn't you...

– And there we go. The Williams' confusion began. – Fred interrupted the girl, laughing at his own joke.

Karla opened her mouth, as if she wanted to say something else, but when she saw everyone laughing, she shook her head and forced a smile too.

That was enough to dissolve the discomfort and the cards started to spin again. But for a moment, before Karla sat back down, I had the impression that there were more people around the table than there should have been.

The sensation was so brief that it almost went unnoticed. Almost.

I woke up in the middle of the night. Almost morning, actually, since we had gone to sleep late. The sound of the fan still cut through the silence of the room, but there was something different. Something I couldn't identify. The house was quieter than usual, as if it was holding its breath.

I looked around the room. Everyone was there, huddled on the mattresses, in a mix of bodies and blankets. The weak sunlight, which seemed to still be deciding whether or not it would rise, entered through the window in a distorted way, creating long and strange shadows on the walls. With every movement I made, it seemed like someone was watching me, but when I looked around, I saw nothing unusual. There was just the heavy silence and the feeling that something was wrong.

I suddenly remembered why I had woken up, and I made my way to the bathroom, stepping over the mattresses trying to be as quiet as possible.

Passing through the kitchen, my gaze was drawn to the figure of someone with their back turned, standing near the window. It was... William, or at least it seemed like him, with his tall body and relaxed posture. But, upon closer inspection, something seemed strange.

He was looking outside, which didn't make sense. The window faced the opposite side of the beach, to an area of thick, dark woods. There was nothing there.

– William? – I called softly, my heart beating faster as I approached.

The figure didn't move. I hesitated for a second, thinking about going back, but the need to go to the bathroom made me take another step forward.

When I got close enough, the light partially illuminated his face. I froze.

It wasn't William. It was another William. His face was turned towards the window, but what made me shiver was his expression. He was smiling.

I quickly moved away, taking a step back. My heart raced. I took a deep breath, trying to convince myself that it was a hallucination or that the boy was sleepwalking, but something told me otherwise. Something was wrong.

— Alex? — Karla's voice cut through the silence, and I turned to see her sitting up in bed, as if she had been woken up by some noise.

— I'm just... I'm just going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.

— Okay. — She lay back down, falling asleep almost instantly.

When I came back from the bathroom, William was standing at the door, almost motionless, waiting for me to come in. Before I went to bed, I instinctively started counting heads. There were eight people sleeping in the living room.

The next day, after returning from the beach, we were all sitting outside again, empty coffee cups and bread crumbs decorating the table. The group was trying to decide what we should have for dinner, some complaining about the heat. An argument was starting, and I couldn't help but feel that something in that house wasn't right.

While they were talking, I got up and went to get another cup of coffee. James went with me. As we walked through the kitchen, I looked up and noticed a trapdoor in the wooden ceiling.

— I haven’t seen this attic until now, — James commented, following my gaze.

— Me neither, and it looks pretty big.

He shrugged and filled our cups. On the way back, I could already hear that the argument outside had escalated.

— I’m telling you, we should go to the market soon. — Sam said, standing up and slamming her hands on the table.

— We have beans and some meat here. We’ll stay for three more days, we can go tomorrow. — Fred replied, trying to keep his usual funny tone.

— Guys, let’s try to settle this calmly? — I said, already heading towards the group outside.

— Look, you guys can make up your own minds. — Sam said, on the edge of anger, standing up and heading towards the kitchen.

— Where are you going? — Fred asked, with a wilted look.

“I’m going over there, away from here. – She replied sarcastically and slammed the door.

— I... I'm going to grab a beer. – William said in a strange tone, as if he didn't know how to speak properly, and also went towards the kitchen.

The atmosphere became awful. Fred had an expression of sadness and confusion, opening and closing his mouth without knowing what to say or do. Karla and Sibila were talking quietly, as if they wanted to distract themselves. James sat in a chair and took out his cell phone, and ""Big"" William shrugged and lit another joint.

He took a long drag and passed it to ""Other"" William, who was sitting next to him.

— Weren't you going to grab a beer? – I asked, sure that I had seen the dude go through the door.

— No, it was William who said it, right?

— I don't even drink beer...

The conversation between the two namesakes was interrupted by a loud noise coming from the kitchen. Everyone stood up at once.

— What was that? - Fred shouted.

We ran to the kitchen. When we arrived, the door was open, and the scene we saw gave me chills like never before. William was inside, but he didn't look the same. His body was bent over, and he was contorting in an inhuman way. I could hear a strange, artificial laugh coming from his face. Not like a person normally laughs, from the bottom of the chest, passing through the vocal cords. The laugh seemed to literally come from his face.

Lying on the floor was Sam. Her body was motionless, her eyes wide in absolute fear. “Bizarre” William was on top of her, with his hands on her throat, squeezing with supernatural strength.

— No... — She tried to say, but her voice faded before she could finish.

The sight was surreal. That... ""thing"" was looking at us with a unsettling smile, as if this was all part of a game. His eyes were... different, as if they were empty.

— What the hell going on? — Fred shouted, trying to get closer.

“William” looked at Fred with a cold and indifferent look, and with a quick movement pushed Sam aside, as if she were just dead weight.

— Is there a problem? — the impostor said in a voice that was both “William’s” and someone else’s. The mix of tones made my stomach turn.

Karla took a step back, and Sibila turned to the door, as if she was thinking about running away.

William took a step towards us, and, with an even stranger smile, he said:

— Now the game begins.

The fight was chaotic, a whirlwind of screams and movement. The third William was everywhere, a threatening presence, attacking without warning. The first to try to confront him was Fred. Fred was a big, tall man, and liked to brag about his street fights. Still, he looked like a child trying in vain to beat up his older brother.

I grabbed Karla by the hand and started running, pushing “Big” William, or “Other” William. Honestly, at this point I didn’t even know who was who inside that house anymore, and all I knew was that I had to disappear as quickly as possible.

My body went into survival mode. I ran out of the house, across the garden and towards the deserted road. The cold air cut my face while the sound of footsteps followed me closely, but I didn’t dare look back. I didn't know how long I ran, without letting go of Karla, dragging her through the streets of that place, and, eventually, I reached a gas station. We stayed there for hours, waiting for the day to dawn, not daring to go back to the house.

When morning finally came, everything seemed... quieter. We went back to the house. I was scared, but also feeling a deep need to understand what happened. The house was empty. There were no signs of struggle, nor of whatever had attacked us. What was left was a disturbing silence.

The attic trapdoor was open. I don't know what made me notice it, and, even stranger, something compelled me, almost forced me to go in there. I told Karla to stay in the living room, and if she saw or heard anything, to run away.

The attic reeked of mold mixed with a metallic smell. Inside, I found more questions than answers. Notes, old photos and newspaper clippings that talked about disappearances in the area. There was something else in the air, a feeling that everything had happened before, but I I couldn't explain.

When I poked my head out, trying to get Karla's attention, I found the room empty. All the hairs on my body stood on end. She was gone. I would have heard her if she had run away, the wooden floor made a lot of noise, but all I heard was a suffocating silence.

I closed the trapdoor and placed a heavy file box on top, and waited. I'm still waiting.

I'm posting this here because I need someone to read it. I don't know how long it will take for it to find me. Something inside me tells me that it already knows where I am, and is just playing its demonic game with me again. I don't know what happened to my friends. I don't know if what I saw was real. But one thing is certain: the William that attacked us was not human. He was something much worse.

I'm writing to warn others. So if anyone is planning a trip to this place, stay away from isolated houses and never, ever trust anyone you think you know. Because now I know, in a very haunting way, that there is more than one William in this world.",2,1736149167.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

But also I’m a routine girly so I’m not that mad about it to be fair. The day also started as well as it could have - Andy woke me up so I got to chat to him as I (very) slowly woke up and then dad bought coffees from the cafe so I had a nice lil flat white while I logged in. I also got some puppy cuddles. So all in all not the worst start to the working year! 

My ‘mini’ work goals, as idk what my ‘big’ goals would be because honestly career progression is so far down my list of priorities at the moment while I work on myself but anyway my mini goals are: 

* do one thing at a time, if I’m doing something and a message comes through then ignore it til I’ve completed what I’m doing - unless it’s urgent/something I’ve been waiting on. 
* trial time blocking again, I think it will help me just get things done and not overthink my approach which just leads to procrastination and not getting things done promptly 
* be more disciplined with time, unless I actually have time to spare then don’t slack off and go do some chores or chat to Andy for an hour or whatever else (though I will of course chat to him because I don’t wanna not chat to him :( )

The candidate, an excellent one, picked the energy only past first two questions.

So don’t do that because when your first question comes up, the interviewer might not be fully engaged. They could be:

- Looking at your resume.
- Shuffling papers.
- Sipping coffee.
- Glancing at the next candidate on the list.
- Checking the time.

This is exactly why your **'Tell me about yourself'** answer cannot be ordinary. While other answers can be straightforward, passive, or even monotonous as long as they are accurate, this response **must stand out.**

Your introduction should have at least **two spikes**—one at the beginning and one at the end. This could be:

- An **extracurricular achievement.**
- A **recent win or accomplishment.**
- Something unique about your profile that ties into the role.
- An interesting piece of information you learned that relates to your field.

The goal is to *remind them of your presence (dekho mein bhi hun idhar)* right from the start. Remember, the interview may have just started for you, but the panel has likely been sitting through multiple sessions already.

1hutlsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hutlsy/should_i_tell_my_fiance_the_truth_about_how_we_met/,Should I tell my fiance the truth about how we met?,"I (24F) saw my fiance (28M) for the first time when I was 21 and he was 25 at a cafe while I was with some of my friends and he was there working by himself. I’ve always been really shy but I couldn’t get myself to initiate anything and I ended up just reading his first name from his coffee cup as I walked by and nothing more. His name is unique enough that I was able to find his linkedin page pretty easily and from there found his full name and eventually his other social media pretty easily. 

Pretty soon, I felt like I already knew him despite having never actually met him. I knew where he worked, had a rough idea of how much he earned, where he lived, and what car he drove. I found out he went to the gym every morning and an MMA gym multiple evenings a week, volunteered weekly at our place of worship, went out almost every Friday and Saturday night, and he was casually seeing other girls at the time.

I decided to accidentally run into him at the gym as it seemed the easiest place for me to know exactly where he was and when and it wouldn’t be too difficult to have a conversation there. I asked for his help and he helped without hesitation and we had a quick chat for just a minute. I bumped into him the next day and we had a longer conversation and he got my number and we went on a date soon after that and he asked me to be his girlfriend a month later.

It’s been almost three years since and he’s been even better than what I had built him up to me in my head and I’m completely in love with him. We’re getting married in two weeks and we found out I’m pregnant just a few days ago. He’s truly the best I could have ever asked for in every way. Ever since I found out I’m pregnant, the memories of how our relationship started have been replaying in my head and part of me feels like I should tell him the truth that I was there at the cafe months before we actually met and methodically planned my way into his life at first.

Things are a bit complicated since our families didn’t make things easy for us at the beginning. My dad initially hated him for me. He thought the age gap between 21 and 25 was too big and worried I was being taken advantage of. My fiance having his ears pierced and a few tattoos also didn’t play well with my dad and he assumed he was a typical fboy. My fiance’s parents were skeptical and thought I was trying to secure a good life by dating someone as successful as their son. It took some time but my dad came around when he got to know him better and my fiance is basically another son for my parents now and his parents are definitely more accepting of me. With this, I’m really conflicted about whether I should tell him the truth about how things really started. I think he would find it a little cute but he might still look at me differently. What should I do?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Black decor has become increasingly popular in interior design, and for good reason. It effortlessly adds a touch of sophistication and luxury to any space. By incorporating black elements, you can transform a mundane room into an elegant sanctuary. Here’s how black decor elevates luxury in your home.

### The Versatility of Black

One of the greatest advantages of using black in interior design is its versatility. Black pairs beautifully with almost any color, making it an ideal foundation for creating a luxurious aesthetic. Here are a few combinations to consider:

- **Black and Gold:** This combination exudes opulence and grandeur.
- **Black and White:** A classic pairing that is both timeless and chic.
- **Black and Jewel Tones:** Rich colors like emerald green or royal blue stand out against black, creating a dramatic effect.

### Creating Depth and Contrast

Black decor adds depth and contrast in ways that other colors may not. When you introduce black elements into a room, they can create a striking focal point. For instance, a black accent wall can provide a strong backdrop for lighter furniture or artwork, drawing the eye and enhancing the room's overall elegance.

Contrast is essential in interior design. A room with various textures and colors will feel more dynamic and inviting. The use of black can help accomplish this balance. Think about incorporating black fixtures, furniture, or even decor items like vases or artwork. These elements will step forward and highlight the lighter pieces in the space.

### Material Matters

Black decor doesn't just exist in color; it also thrives in material. Different textures can dramatically improve the feel of your space. Consider these luxurious materials:

- **Black Velvet:** This plush material adds an element of softness and warmth.
- **Matte Black Finishes:** These lend a modern edge to accessories and furniture.
- **Glossy Black Surfaces:** A glossy finish can reflect light beautifully, enhancing the luxurious atmosphere.

When combined thoughtfully, these textures can create a rich, layered look that captivates the senses.

### Elegant Lighting Solutions

Lighting is paramount in setting the ambiance of any room. black decor allows for unique lighting opportunities. Black lampshades and fixtures can direct light more effectively, creating warmth and intimacy. A chandelier with black accents can draw the eye upward, emphasizing the height of the room and adding an element of grandeur.

Additionally, consider using dimmers for your black lighting fixtures. This allows you to control the mood, ensuring that at any time, your space can exude sophistication and comfort.

### Statement Pieces

Black decor is perfect for creating statement pieces. A bold black sofa or a striking black coffee table can instantly elevate the luxury of your living space. These statement pieces serve as a focal point and can shape the style of the entire room. It’s important to balance these bold items with lighter accessories to maintain harmony.

### Home Accessories to Explore

Small decor elements can also contribute to the overall luxurious feel of your home. Here are some accessories worth considering:

- **Black Picture Frames:** Perfect for showcasing your favorite artwork or cherished memories.
- **Black Throw Pillows:** Excellent for adding texture and comfort.
- **Decorative Black Objects:** Sculptures or vases can add depth and interest to tabletops.


Black decor into your home can significantly elevate its luxury and style. By using contrasting colors, rich textures, elegant lighting, and statement pieces, you can create an environment that feels sophisticated and inviting. Remember to balance black elements with lighter ones to prevent overwhelming the space. Embrace the power of black decor and let it transform your home into a luxurious retreat.

Color Psychology: How Black Influences Perception of Wealth and Sophistication
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Color holds a significant power in our lives, influencing our emotions and behaviors in ways we often may not realize. Among the colors in the spectrum, black stands out for its unique ability to evoke feelings of wealth and sophistication. It can transform any space or item, imparting an air of luxury that captivates the senses. Let's explore how the color black achieves this remarkable effect.

### The Allure of Black

Black is frequently associated with elegance and refinement. This color's timeless nature makes it a favorite in high-end fashion, interior design, and luxury brands. When you think about the sleek lines of a designer handbag or the refined exterior of a luxury car, black is often the shade chosen to exude style and sophistication.

### Key Psychological Associations with Black

- **Power:** Black conveys authority and strength. It generates a perception of power, which can enhance a person's or product's perceived value.
- **Mystery:** The color's dark nature adds an element of intrigue. This quality can draw people in, compelling them to learn more.
- **Exclusivity:** Black is often associated with elite status. Items predominantly displayed in this color can give the impression of being rare or hard to obtain.

### Black in Design and Fashion

In both fashion and interior design, black serves as a versatile backdrop or focal point that can complement other colors while adding depth. Here’s how it creates a luxurious atmosphere:

- **Creating Contrast:** Black provides excellent contrast with lighter colors, making them pop. This contrast can highlight finer details in clothing or decorative elements in a room, enhancing the overall aesthetic.
- **Timeless Appeal:** Whether it’s a chic little black dress or black leather furniture, these items remain in style regardless of trends. This timelessness associates black with a lasting value, much like classic luxury pieces.
- **Streamlined Elegance:** The simplicity of black lines can lead to a clean and sophisticated look. Minimalist styles often utilize black to create an upscale atmosphere.

### Cultural Perceptions of Black

Cultural factors also play a pivotal role in how black is perceived. In many Western societies, black is synonymous with sophistication. It is the color of choice for formal occasions, like galas and weddings. In contrast, in some other cultures, black may evoke different meanings, such as mourning or formal rites. However, despite these variations, the color consistently maintains an element of sophistication across various contexts.

### Practical Applications in Home Decor

Using black in home decor can drastically alter the ambiance of a space. Here are some practical applications of black decor that can elevate your home:

- **Accent Walls:** Painting one wall black can create a dramatic effect that elevates the entire room's sophistication. It encourages a modern vibe and can pair beautifully with metallic or pastel accents.
- **Furniture:** Black furniture, such as sofas or dining tables, can ground a room and deliver a polished look. Consider adding gold or silver accessories to enhance the luxury feel.
- **Artwork and Decor:** Black frames or sculptures can serve as eye-catching focal points that draw attention without overpowering the space.

### Luxury Branding in Black

Luxury brands often utilize black as a primary color in their logos, packaging, and advertising campaigns. This choice is intentional and strategic. Brands like Chanel, Gucci, and Tesla leverage the power of black to evoke feelings of sophistication and class. When customers see black, they often associate it with high-quality, premium products, reinforcing the notion that these brands are at the pinnacle of luxury.

Black's influence on our perception of wealth and sophistication is undeniable. Its ability to evoke power, mystery, and exclusivity makes it a favored choice among designers and brands alike. Whether you choose to incorporate black through fashion, decor, or branding, you invite an element of luxury into your life that is both timeless and captivating.

### Conclusion

Black decor undeniably plays a significant role in transforming the atmosphere of any space, elevating it into a realm of luxury and sophistication. The way we perceive color significantly affects our emotions and thoughts, and black stands out as a powerful symbol of elegance and class. By incorporating black elements, whether through furniture, wall paint, or decorative accessories, you can create an environment that exudes confidence and opulence.

I have 2 older brothers B1 (32 M) and B2 (29 M). I was at work a few weeks ago and wanted to get my mum tickets to a musical for her birthday/Christmas (she loves musicals). I told B2 about it, and he thought it was a good idea and also wanted to put in for it ($100). Great! I then texted B1, asked if he also wanted to join the gift, and let him know it was $100. Well, did he blow up. (side note B1 lives at home with mum and dad, and myself while B2 lives with his fiance). B1 went on a rant about how this is the worst economy ever had, and spending money was so stupid. I then told him not to worry about it and that he is not invited to be a part of the gift. He then replied and said mum and dad didn't raise me right at that when WW3 happens and I end up a sex slave due to debt he'll save me and thank him as well as a bunch of other sexist comments. Side note B1 has never had a full-time job, doesn't have friends, is single and sits at home a lot. I didnt respond. I did text my mum that we need to have a conversation about B1 when her and dad got back from their holiday (in 1 week). 

Fast forward the week B1 and I didnt say a word to each other. Mum and Dad get home from their trip and mum comes to my room and asks what is going on. I show her the texts that B1 sent me and she starts to tear up. She said that she had also been getting messages like that from him for a while and she cries at work when she gets them. She then thought he could have bipolar or something because his emotions are so up and down. A few days before they got back my Dad sent B1 a photo of where they were having breakfast and he replied ""Good hope you're having fun because when you get back im fucking out of here"" Mum and I talk a bit more about the situation and it ended with my mum saying ""i don't know what i did wrong with him"". 

A couple hours later im in my room when i suddenly hear 2 loud bangs on my door and thought it was weird. Next second B1 is at my bedroom door screaming and banging. He screamed stuff like ""stop manipulating mum and dad, i know you've deleted text messages, get out here and stop being a fucking coward"" and so on. I would also like to say that B1 is 6 foot 4, 95kg and no body fat while im 5 foot 11 and 60kg. So i start crying and freaking out because i dont know what to do or what will happen if he gets in my room. I start trying to call my mum to wake her up (they sleep downstairs and my room is upstairs). I called like 5 times and B1 was still screaming and banging my door. I then called B2 and asked if he is home and he said he wasnt but asked what was going on. I told him through tears and he told me to call the police. I said id try mum 1 more time before i called the police. so i did. As i called mum again B1 left. He got in his car and drove out. I then ran down to my parents room crying and woke them up and told them what happened. My mum then checked her phone and saw that B1 had texted her and i saw the first line which say ""if you want her you can fucking have her""

Safe to say i didnt sleep well that night. The next morning had a breakfast arranged with a friend and as i was leaving B1 came back. Safe to say Road runner had nothing on me with the speed i left home. 

I get home from coffee with my friend and my parents let me know B1 wont be home for a bit. A couple days later my parents tell me B1 called them crying and saying his mental health isnt great and he has no where to go. 

My dad says he cant come back home for a bit. Then a few days later was my mums birthday and they told me B1 was coming over a bit to see mum and I said I dont want to be here and I dont feel safe around him. They said that fine and that they'll let me know when he leaves. 

Fast forward a few days after that its now a Monday and I was sitting downstairs talking to my mum. She then said she wanted to go get lunch and hang out with me so we organised to watch a movie the following day and get lunch after. Just as im about to leave for work she says ""just letting you know we are going to let B1 sleep here"" I said i wasnt comfortable with that and she said ""well we cant let him sleep on the street, he has nowhere to go"".

I dont have time to argue and i go to work. On my way home i become anxious and let my mum know. When i arrive home im crying and go straight to my room and start packing stuff. My mum comes up and keeps telling me im safe and it will all be ok. I then look at her and ask if she gave him house keys and she said yes. I then asked if she planned to hang out with me tomorrow because she knew he was going to be here and she said no. 

I kept packing and she kept saying i was safe and i just ignored her and then she got annoyed and said ""fine then if youre not going to talk to me"" and stormed out my room. I called B2 and asked if i could sleep at his that night and he agreed. 

When i got to his we chatted about everything and questions like ""what line does B1 have to cross fro mum and dad to choose and protect me over him"" and ""why is my safety not of their concern"" and ""they said they didnt want any of us on the street but they've literally chosen someone who has emotionally abused safety over mine"" 

My mum texted me on tuesday and said that they were trying to do the best for both of us and that if i need to come collect more stuff to let her know. I told her that she only did the best for one and that i hope she can live with choose a son who emotionally abused their daughter over their daughter. 

I did duck back home when my mum had organise the movie for us and B1 was home (of course). I grab some stuff and let without anyone noticing. 

So am i the asshole for trying to get my mum a 60th birthday gift??",3,1736147050.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1hut9h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeRaw/comments/1hut9h1/sg_hawker_coffee_shop_rough_rental_analysis/,SG Hawker / Coffee Shop Rough Rental Analysis,"Having read some news that downplayed the significance of rental fees on hawker food prices, my partner and I decided to do some quick independent research to know for sure.

The quoted figure we've seen tossed around is the NEA assessed median rent (AMR) of $1200/month. However, the AMR is an independently assessed figure NEA primarily uses to negotiate tenancy renewals and not actually the current trending market prices for rents.

In search for a better understanding, below is a rough analysis on the August to October 2024 ""landlord costs"" for NEA non-subsidized cooked food hawker stalls + comparable coffeeshop / non-hawker F&B rentals. These are based on NEA Tenders plus online rental postings, and would include rentals but also expected monthly recurring landlord costs (table cleaning & conservancy charges).

[SG Hawker / Coffee Shop Rough Rental Analysis - Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vQgxc2VGbb1psUgIvFCoDyfk8roWKiHA4YpLtW9Y4e3bz7vW9c2u-Nuly8tby_MDdLGhwpP0EAK8Dl2/pubhtml#)

Methodology, Justifications, Raw Data, Sources and Analysis is all in there.

**Key Findings for quick review here:**

* Median ""Landlord Costs"" were around 2900 SGD to 3300 SGD. High and quite significant, but likely not the only significant factor at play
* High rents do exist (>4k), a few for cooked food but mostly for drink stalls
* Low rents also exist (<1k), even for cooked food (yay Chinatown complex). However most of these are for Halal / Indian stalls, but market rate rentals exist also for select Halal / Indian stalls as well.

**Key Life Lessons for immediate effect:**

* Eat at the Halal / Indian Stall
* Don't buy drinks if you want to save money (duh)
* Try exploring further and in more ulu places for good and cheap food
* Actually stalk the NEA tender page for low rental places to visit

We recognize that the sample size could be larger, that commercial real estate is super complex and there may have been other more valid ways to go about the data. Welcome comments, feedback and alternative analysis (the data is public on NEA's Tender Page).

For now, we just wanted to provide an initial counterpoint to the 1.2k AMR figure and hope we have done so in a reasonable way.

Hiiii!

Im an international student applying who‘s graduating in Fall 2026, I genuinely love agriculture and it has been one of my passions for years together, im going to post my application and I would love for you guys to tell me what you think :))

Grades: Pretty bad, but I made the honor roll and the deans list throughout, I had a B- and a C throughout all of my semesters for math and English respectively, with A’s in every single other subject :(. But this year I have a 37/42 in the IB syllabus. I know my grades aren’t the best, which is why I’m putting my extracurriculars below. I’m going to say a 3.75 GPA throughout. I’ve still got to finish my SAT.

I’ve also gotten highest in my grade for Math (this year), I also passed the IGCSE course with distinction.

EC’s: Visited multiple farms and estates through high school, with great rec letters. I started a fundraiser to maximise positive socioeconomic impact through the purchase of new technologies for small scale farmers. I lived on a massive estate with daily wage laborers every summer and worked with them, experiencing everything that they did (picking coffee, sweeping leaves etc…). I worked with the equivalent of a US congressman to create and develop websites to help assist farmers in times of crisis, we launched the websites last month :).

School related EC’s: Participated in multiple Model United Nations, chaired multiple committees in Model United Nations, i will also be applying for a position in the secretariat next year, hopefully I get in :). In addition to this, I also am leader of my grade in the student government.

Social work: Donated 10,000 newspapers to a veterans home near me, they sell these papers to fund their organisation. I also funded 3 large ventilators and worked with the home to supply meals for the elderly veterans. I also worked in a small preschool, helping educate young children. I also helped provide stationary for all the students at the school.

If you’re still here, genuinely, thank you :). 😄😄😄😄😄. Please let me know what you think of my application, I’ve always wanted to go to Columbia and did a summer program there as well. You guys are all amazing, have a great rest of your day/night/afternoon! :)",0,1736146747.0,IBO,3,0.5,False

I have been talking to my therapist for years stating I believe I have a binging disorder. She is lovely and amazing and has helped me through so much in my life in the last few years but food remains a problem. 

TW : I think about food all
day, I’ll restrict and do well for a couple
of days and I’ll go right back to
my bullshit 😭 I am now on seroquel needed for sleep and have been on this as well as other psych meds for four years now and it has caused a weight gain ofc but the food noise is just unbearable. I had it before this but gaining weight so quickly
only added to the shame. I feel defeated by food. For example, I was upset about a mess up in my diet yesterday and since I had to work 12 hours today, I grabbed a dunkin coffee * i’m automatically clocking the bad decision, debating the calories etc* ordered a everything. bagel with cream cheese, i ate about two bites and said forget it and tossed it frustrated with myself. for lunch I ate grilled chicken pieces and an ENTIRE cut up cucumber, seasoned ok bread as a sandwich, then I had a yogurt, later that evening I was offered food so ofc I had a few bites ( I can never turn down any food) 🥺 I finished that off with an avocado I packed today. and some nuts. This is over a span of a whole day I’m just eating literally all day long. On my way home I got a sheetz smoothie bc that can’t be that calorie dense ( yes it could even without the whip) and don’t get me started on the dove chocolates I got for christmas. It just never ever ends. 

I always buy myself an iced
coffee daily on my way to work if not two if i’m really tired ( another one in the evening) I’m awful, I’m disgusted. I hate it and myself. 

My therapist states that I don’t meet criteria for binging bc binging is large quantities multiple times a day, but isn’t this binging? I think she’s also careful because I have bulimia and while I have no acted on impulses in four years she states I just “ adhd eat” 


Whatever it is it’s ruining my life and I hate the way I feel and look please if anyone has advice I really need help. I’m addicted to sugar as an added plus and I’m sure that’s not helping. All I know is that I am miserable and every other week THIS is going to be the week I stop, and I fail every time. I need to have some control over myself and I just feel I have none, I’ve seen nutritionists, I’ve taken adipex ( it did work for years but Seroquel
brought the weight back ) i’ve tried pinterest, meal plans, tiktok, I am a monster 
I think I just need to hear I’m not alone I’m
so depressed 


TLDR : I eat all damn day long I am disgusted with myself and I need help ",2,1736146301.0,BingeEatingDisorder,4,1.0,False

I left for 15 minutes and come back and she had made herself a ""cup of coffee"". It was actually about 5oz of half and half, 2 globs of sour cream, and a hefty scoop of coffee grounds.

She randomly stood up and removed the clock from the wall that has been there forever and she has never fixated on before, said ""this is my clock"" and hid it in one of her many stashes around the house. 

She is on day 2 of wearing her underwear on the outside of her pants despite me constantly reminding her that it's not necessary. 

This disease is horrible and exhausting, but it's definitely not boring and I am still able to laugh about the completely out of pocket stuff that comes up on a daily basis, the harmless ones of course.

**Notable characters:** Can't remember sorry.

**Notable gameplay mechanics:** Can't remember sorry.

**Other details:** My strongest memory of the game is of the early story. The setting has a magic that can make things out of nothing, which people have become reliant on. But the older/better magic is running out and is being substituted for a newer, more ""artificial"" version. A scene I remember is character using a magic item like a card to create a drink (a cup of coffee IIRC) for another, and the 2nd character says something along the lines of ""you remember the taste well"". So the magic relies on the casters memory of the item to recreate it accurately.

At the end of the starting section, an event separates you from your companions (can't remember if they die or just go missing), and the next section has you teamed up with new companions. I remember the equipment of the first companions carrying over to the new team.

## Keeping Your Drinks Secure and Organized on the Go: A Guide to the Best Stroller Cup Holder Attachments

Finding the right stroller cup holder attachment can transform your daily walks with your little one.  No more precarious balancing acts with your coffee, spilled juice, or juggling your phone while trying to navigate a busy sidewalk. This guide will help you choose the perfect stroller cup holder attachment to keep your drinks secure and organized, leaving you free to focus on your precious cargo.

### Understanding Your Needs: Key Features to Consider

Before diving into specific product recommendations, let's explore the crucial features to consider when selecting a stroller cup holder attachment.  The right choice depends on your stroller type, your preferred beverage containers, and your personal preferences.

**1. Compatibility:** This is arguably the most critical factor.  Not all cup holders are created equal. Some boast universal designs compatible with a wide range of stroller brands (like UPPAbaby, Chicco, Britax, Baby Jogger, etc.), while others are specifically designed for particular models. Check your stroller's specifications carefully before purchasing to avoid disappointment.  Pay attention to the attachment method – some clamp onto the stroller frame, while others may utilize existing cup holders or stroller accessories.

**2. Material and Durability:**  Durability is key, especially considering the constant jostling and potential drops during your walks. Opt for sturdy materials like high-quality plastic, reinforced metal, or even silicone for added grip and shock absorption.  Read reviews to gauge how well the cup holder withstands daily use.  Avoid flimsy plastic that might crack easily.

**3. Cup Size and Shape:**  Consider the size and shape of your go-to beverage containers.  Measure the diameter of your water bottle, coffee mug, or sippy cup.  Many cup holders specify a maximum diameter, typically ranging from 2 to 3.5 inches.  However, some are designed to accommodate larger containers like the popular 40 oz Stanley Cup.  Also, check if the holder accommodates various shapes – some are better suited for cylindrical containers, while others can handle more irregular shapes.


**4. Additional Features:**  Many stroller cup holders offer additional features that can enhance your strolling experience.  These include:

* **Integrated Phone Holders:**  Keep your phone within easy reach for navigation, photos, or quick calls.  Ensure the phone holder is secure and compatible with your phone size.
* **Storage Compartments:** Some cup holders incorporate extra storage for keys, wallets, or even small snacks, optimizing your organization.
* **Trays:**  Some models include trays for snacks or toys, keeping your little one entertained and preventing spills.
* **Easy Installation and Removal:**  Look for a design that's easy to attach and detach from your stroller.  A simple, one-handed installation is highly desirable for convenience.

**5. Price Point:**  Stroller cup holder attachments range in price, from budget-friendly options to more premium models with additional features.  Determine your budget and prioritize the features most important to you.

### Addressing Common Concerns and Misconceptions

**Q: How do I prevent spills?**

So I saw that [Reddit post with Marge and control nodes](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1h6ki3a/me_making_a_game_with_almost_exclusively_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and it really made me think of the the end product. At the end of the day, many games can be boiled down to control nodes interacting with each other. So I decided to put aside my tower defense game for now and work on a mobile app for coffee brewing that I had an idea for years ago. I used to be a barista and super nerdy about coffee and this idea was something that I have such a clear vision (how it should work, how it can look, the data needed and so on) that the focus would then be on coding and learning Godot. So far I have made this:

[Coffee brewing app](https://reddit.com/link/1huspq6/video/drw7upf98bbe1/player)

Everything (sans logo) is made with control nodes, a dictionary saves and changes the brewing recipes and signals are used in places like to increase values and hovering effects. 

Looking at what I have created with this app, I can actually imagine myself coding something like The Bazaar or games with heavy data interaction. I have been watching Northernlion play these days and have thought to myself, ""yea I see how that can be coded!"". In my mind, these types of games are all about data management, interactions and UI.

I learned a lot about dictionaries with this app, first I made a nested dictionary system. Then I learned how to add a key and value to a dictionary, then I learned how to select and set a specific key, then I made functions to streamline the process, then I redid the whole dictionary system since I didn't like the nesting of dictionaries and finally I have a dictionary system I am happy with. One dictionary for recipes. One dictionary for individual brews. Initially I was so hung up on combining the two dictionaries but over time I realized that the two really needed to be decoupled. Is dictionaries the best way to organize the data for this app? I have no idea but right now my hammer is the Dictionary (because I wanted to learn how to use it) and every piece of data looks like a key = value entry xD

[How a recipe dictionary entry looks like](https://preview.redd.it/vwo0acv39bbe1.jpg?width=1069&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6d15a1429761ee194883e25561613dc74a532c9)

I needed to create a time function and initially I made it myself with two different variables (one for seconds and one for minutes). When the seconds variable went over 60, it would become 0 and += the minute variable. I also had to do the same in the opposite direction and lots of edge cases arose. It was finnicky but it worked. Then I looked into how other people might make something similar and it blew my mind how they approached it. What blew my mind was the amount of code they used and the way they cascaded the information downwards and got the minutes and seconds easily with very little code. This is the function I created to add and subtract seconds from the time variable.

[My first time variable approach was probably x5 the length in code +\_\_+](https://preview.redd.it/qewmss8m9bbe1.jpg?width=688&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=625caba5d472e7acd80e03cfe8d78690520fad37)

I come from a design background so working with InDesign and styles is something I am quite familiar with. Learning that Godot has a rough version of that brought a sense of familiarity to things. It was easier than expected.

[Styles are pretty much like styles in InDesign](https://preview.redd.it/tz161hrt9bbe1.jpg?width=963&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af14f91186efe624b1dc72f9fc05e61aab2bac82)

There were some quirks that really come out of left-field. For example, type variations. If you create a type variation of like a button, you need to manually write the exact name into the type variation field (or set the theme in Project Settings). I was bumping my head against the wall forever with this one and would not have figured it out unless I read the documentation where they say [""Variations appear on the list only if the type variation belongs to the project-wide theme, which you can configure in the project settings""](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/ui/gui_theme_type_variations.html). So reading documentation is something I keep using more and more if there is a feature I want to go deeper into and learn properly and I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the documentation of Godot!

[NumpadSmall that I manually wrote out in the Type Variation field to apply the style](https://preview.redd.it/o3281g03abbe1.jpg?width=809&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdc17e4d5a65de488bc67eddf2d4da56fb1b85a9)

I ended up creating a fully functional numpad that suited my needs but in the end, I decided to streamline all the brewing variable inputs to -/+.

Using hotkeys like find/replace (CTRL + Shift + F) to do code wide tweaks. Want to call something ""Recipes"" instead of ""Data"" but you have used Data all over the place, find and replace that with a couple of clicks. 

Same thing but on a document level, select one instance of the text you want to tweak, press CTRL + D and it will select the next instance of it below. Easily tweak multiple instances of text in a jiffy! I used this a lot especially when I think I can name a variable better.

Github is great and I keep thinking about how solid it is. I had a moment where I wanted to go from Nested dictionaries to two different dictionaries and I made a commit checkpoint. Tried properly building the nested dictionaries but didn't like it, then saved it and went back to the old commit and continued with a single dictionary. Having these snapshot saves of my code allows me to try different paths without not fully committing to any single path until I am certain that it is what I want.

Right now I am creating a roguelike part of the app where multiple options pop up recommending ways you can change your brewing recipe according to the extraction level and taste of your coffee. Once that is done, I also want to save each individual brew in a separate dictionary so the user can see all the brews they have done. Perhaps have a rating system of sorts too. Here is the logic that uses the taste slider and extraction sliders that will then influence the recipe tweaks shown.

[Looks messy but... works as intended!](https://preview.redd.it/31yqto1vabbe1.jpg?width=946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8146cd3b88af51aa7f51af6fc1290b3535fc85a)

One thing I found interesting here is that massaging the way I interacted with the sliders and what I wanted the results to be at certain ranges became the way I landed on these ranges and statements. It a rare instance where I use outside knowledge (coffee brewing knowledge) to influence how certain code should act. I feel like I should do this more often, test a lot to make sure it \*feels\* right and that the values are in the appropriate ranges.

I had a great game dev meeting with two of my buds, one is coding in Unity, one is coding in Unreal and it is fascinating to see the different engines doing their thing. I tried out the two engines before I got deep into Godot and as I am learning more, I am quite glad that I decided to stick with Godot as it suits me and all of my needs. 

I also want to whip this app to a point where I feel ready to plop it on itch.io / build it for iOS and Android! Learning how to do final exports and stuff is something I want to go through early on so it doesn't loom over me as an uncertainty in the game dev process.

Holgrim woke up at noon, still groggy from his sleep. He felt like he had slept for weeks instead of hours, which gave him a headache. He exited his tent and stretched, taking a deep breath of air. He had set up his camp in a lush, verdant meadow the previous night, a few hours after leaving the giant's village, having had a quick dinner before finally getting to sleep as the first rays of morning stretched over the horizon.

He moved over to the still-smouldering embers of the fire he had made last night, tossing a few more pieces of wood on the coals. A bit of magic soon had the fire crackling once more. He grabbed his frying pan and cracked a few eggs to make some fried egg sandwiches. Sitting by the fire, sipping a small mug of black coffee, he cooked his brunch, his headache had cleared, which allowed him to fully appreciate the day.

The vibrant green grass stretched out like a plush carpet under his feet, each blade kissed by the soft glow of the afternoon sun, which cast dappled shadows from the swaying leaves of the ancient oak tree near where he had set up camp the previous night. Above, a cobalt blue sky, streaked with wisps of clouds, served as a tranquil backdrop to this pastoral tableau. The warmth of the day was palpable, as the meadow teemed with life: bees buzzed lazily between blossoms, a swarm of butterflies fluttered in the winds, and the distant melody of songbirds filled the air.

A smile tugged at Holgrim’s lips as he glanced up from his cooking, the warmth of the fire still lingering on his skin. He finished cooking the eggs and set them aside before reaching for slices of brown bread. His fingers worked with practiced ease, spreading mayonnaise and layering cold bacon he had cooked earlier. The crispy texture contrasted with the softness of the eggs. Sliding the eggs carefully between the slices, he pressed the sandwich together with a contented sigh.

He took his first bite, savouring the balance of flavours, but before he could take another, a slight rustling caught his attention. His gaze shifted toward the movement at the edge of the camp.

A family of bunnies—one mother and two kits—hopped closer, drawn by the new scents and sounds of the camp. The mother, with fur as white as the first snowfall and eyes as deep as midnight, kept a watchful eye on her young, her nose twitching as she tested the air. Her ears flicked at every sound, yet she allowed the kits to explore, trusting them in the calm embrace of the meadow.

The kits, full of unrestrained energy, tumbled through the wildflowers, their tiny paws brushing against the soft petals. They were a blur of movement, each captivated by the world around them. The larger kit, covered in soft cream-coloured fur, leaped at the butterflies drifting through the air, its tiny paws outstretched as it tried to catch one. The smaller kit, a pure albino bunny, wandered closer to Holgrim, its pink eyes wide with wonder as it inspected the strange creature before it—a man, sitting so still and quiet.

Holgrim watched them, the warmth of the morning sun on his back and the peaceful rhythm of the meadow settling over him. With deliberate slowness, he reached into his bag and pulled out a few stalks of celery. He bent down, holding the stalks near the ground, letting the small albino kit inch closer. It sniffed the air, its tiny nose twitching, before gently grasping the celery with its mouth. Proud, it scampered back to its mother, offering the treat.

As the mother and kits began to nibble on the celery, Holgrim took another bite of his sandwich, his senses alive with the soft crunch of the bread and the rich, salty flavour of the bacon. The peaceful sight before him—the bunnies, the quiet meadow—felt like a perfect moment. He couldn’t help but smile again as he discreetly pulled out his camera, capturing a snapshot of the small family. They continued to munch on their meal, unaware of the moment being preserved, and when they had finished, they hopped away, their tiny tails disappearing into the thick grass.

Holgrim leaned back, watching them go, his thoughts lingering in the stillness of the moment. He took a final sip of coffee before rising to his feet, stretching his stiff limbs. It was time to pack up. He began to pack up his camp, putting out the fire. As much as he would have liked to continue enjoying the day, he still had a few more ashes to scatter. He checked his map and plotted his new course, this time making his way east. He took one last look around the field, then jumped into the air and activated his flight ring, propelling himself into the azure sky and the high-altitude wind currents that would speed him along to his next location.

I joined Invisible almost two years ago and worked my way up from an Advanced AI Data Trainer to a long-term role as a Quality Analyst. I've worked on over five projects for them, including one of their largest and most stable. However, that project was abruptly shut down, and I was moved to another poorly managed project. After years of dedication, I’ve had enough of this company’s toxic practices.

**Unstable Projects and Job Insecurity**

* **Sudden Project Closures:** Your project can end with little to no notice, leaving you without work. If you're lucky and well-connected, you *might* be moved to another project. If not, you’re stuck in the ""Marketplace.""
* **The ""Marketplace"" Disaster:** This is a buggy platform full of outdated and inactive job listings. It’s a testament to the incompetence of Invisible's engineering team.

**Exploitation of Employees**

* **False Promises to Volunteers:** I witnessed several Quality Analysts volunteer to help temporarily on other projects. They were promised their original positions back, but instead, they were permanently reassigned or left in the Marketplace. Some have been waiting for work for over six months.
* **Declining Pay:** Pay rates are dropping, and they exploit international workers by offering them lower wages for the same work.

**Toxic Workplace Practices**

* **Favoritism and Nepotism:** Promotions are not merit-based. I’ve seen unqualified individuals get management roles because of personal connections. For example, an Operations Analyst was hired because an executive liked him as a barista at a coffee shop.
* **Unprofessional HR:** Complaints to HR are met with unprofessional responses, such as informal Slack messages weeks later, instead of proper follow-ups.
* **Lack of Career Growth:** Skills and experience from previous projects are ignored when you’re reassigned. You’re often forced to start from scratch, while newcomers get fast-tracked for promotions.
* **Favoritism and Nepotism:** Promotions are not merit-based. I’ve seen unqualified individuals get management roles because of personal connections. For example, an Operations Analyst was hired because an executive liked him as a barista at a coffee shop.
* **Unprofessional HR:** Complaints to HR are met with unprofessional responses, such as informal Slack messages weeks later, instead of proper follow-ups.

**Poor Management and Training**

* **Unqualified Leaders:** I’ve watched managers with no relevant skills mismanage projects into failure.
* **Inconsistent Training:** Training quality varies wildly between projects. Some materials are riddled with errors and appear hastily put together.
* **Poor Management and Training Unqualified Leaders:** I’ve watched managers with no relevant skills mismanage projects into failure. 
* **Inconsistent Training:** Training quality varies wildly between projects. Some materials are riddled with errors and appear hastily put together.

**Corporate Culture**

* **Pretend Friendliness:** Management uses fake camaraderie, calling agents ""besties,"" but it’s all superficial.
* **Surveillance Overreach:** Most projects require invasive 24/7 Hubstaff tracking, with regular desktop screenshots and audits. You’re treated like an employee but classified as a contractor. They’re already being sued for worker misclassification.
* **Uninspiring Leadership:** The founder regularly sends long, rambling emails that make him a laughingstock among employees.

**My Advice**

Don’t waste your time with Invisible Technologies. Go to a competitor that values your skills and pays you fairly. For instance, xAI is hiring, and I hear they offer fair compensation.

Personally, I’m leaving this industry to become a teacher because this job taught me I love helping people—but I cannot deal with corporate exploitation anymore.

**Final Words**

To anyone from Invisible Technologies reading this:

If you want to take legal action against me for this post, go ahead. I have evidence to back every claim and know many ex-employees who share my experience. This company will break your spirit. Avoid it at all costs.

**TL;DR: Invisible Technologies is a toxic workplace that exploits its workers, promotes based on favoritism, and provides no job security. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.**",7,1736144334.0,antiwork,5,0.82,False

CreepyPasta Story: The Hunted/ Daniel Hudson 

I never wanted to write this down. Some truths should stay buried in the dark corners of our minds, locked away where they can't infect others. But after what I discovered about this killer that many dreamed - The Hunted, I feel obligated to warn others. Maybe then the families that suffered can find some closure.


 What I'm about to share will haunt you as much as it haunted me.


I'm a detective in rural Montana, and for the past eight months, I've been investigating a series of disappearances along the remote stretches of Skalkaho Highway. At first, they didn't connect. just some people being stupid, forgetting to mark their way back. 


But soon, I realized the patterns.
The victims always vanished near dawn or dusk. Their vehicles would be found intact, sometimes still running, as if they'd just stepped out for a moment. No signs of struggle. No blood, No bodies. 
Just more dead ends and questions that kept me awake.


ENTRY 2


I can't believe we almost dismissed the case, if it wasn't for the cameras we put that case would have been lost.




A forest service worker found something strange while checking trail cameras last October. The images showed a blue Ford F-150 appearing in different remote locations over several months, always in the pre-dawn hours. The truck was distinctive – rusted hood, missing rear bumper, and a gun rack visible through the back window. 


I ran the plates. The truck belonged to Daniel Hudson, no fixed address. His record was clean except for a single hunting violation from three years ago. But something about his DMV photo made my skin crawl. His eyes held no light, no warmth – just the flat, dead stare with a warm smile. It unsettled me for some reason.


ENTRY 3


Deep in the Bitterroot National Forest, miles from any marked trail, we discovered bodies, hanging from ropes. The first tree stood alone in a small clearing.


I've been a detective for fifteen years, seeing things that would break most people. What I saw, hanging from those branches.


I still can't sleep to this day without dreaming of that day. The bodies were strung up like trophies, wrapped in barbed wire that dug too deep into the rotting flesh.


 They'd been gutted, drained, hung like a sick way to get others' attention.
Each victim had been ""processed"" with surgical precision… some, not so lucky.


We found more west of the first, each with its own grotesque display, and disfigurement.


The forensics confirmed what we'd all feared – all the missing people were there, transformed into a horrible warning to stay away.


The evidence we gathered painted a picture of a man who'd crossed a line most of us can't even imagine. He didn't kill for money, revenge, or any of the usual motives, but to be feared and left alone. To just live


ENTRY 4


We found a journal in an abandoned hunting cabin, proposed to be the killer's. The entries started normally enough – observations about weather patterns, animal movements, typical hunter's notes. But they devolved into something else, more personal.


“ I never meant to become this way!


 I truly mean it. The hunger started small – just a growing sensation in my gut that normal food couldn't satisfy.
 I just ignored it at first, living my ordinary life, working my job as a Doctor, across the Midwest. Sleeping in my old truck, feeding the cat I found a week before.


 But the hunger grew, and with it came whispers.


On a cold night in northern Michigan. I was parked on a remote logging road, trying to save money instead of getting a motel. The moon hung full and heavy through my windshield, casting long shadows through the bare branches. That's when I first heard them – voices, telling me what I needed to do to survive.


I resisted for weeks. Living on the gas station coffee and beef jerky, and some old dinners crappie food.


 Good coffee though.




But you can only fight your nature for so long. The hunger was eating me from the inside out, making me imagine things that weren't there, having nightmares none stop.


. I lost thirty pounds that month. My reflection showed sunken eyes and skin stretched thin over my cheekbones. I decided to see a doctor, but it didn't help. they'd just give me some pills and threw me out.




I was checking out an abandoned barn for a place to sleep when I found the coil of rusty barbed wire. Something about the way it gleamed in my flashlight beam made my hands shake. The whispers grew louder, and the hunger twisted like a knife in my gut. When a hiker came by asking if I needed help, I couldn't stop myself. The wire felt right in my hands, natural, like it was always meant to be there. I think I blacked out as the next thing I saw I had hung him high in an old oak tree. The hunger subsided for the first time in months. I felt strong but weak, sick almost. 


That was three years ago. I'm twenty-six now, and I've learned a lot since then. The barbed wire was crude, amateur. I've refined my methods, learned to use tools that feel like extensions of myself – compound bows, hunting knives, and a gun. My truck is my home, my hunting blind, my sanctuary. I keep moving, following the backroads and forest trails across state lines, always staying ahead of the questions and missing person reports.


I'm not proud of what I do, but I've accepted it. This isn't about violence or cruelty – it's about survival. My survival from whatever is out there.


The authorities don't understand, of course. They're looking for someone driven by rage or vengeance, but they're wrong. I'm driven by something I can't even comprehend, something evil. 


I'm just doing it because I hope one day it will stop.






I've gotten better at choosing my hunting grounds. State forests, national parks, places where people go to ""find themselves."" They never expect someone like me, someone who looks as normal as their neighbor or coworker. I keep my truck clean, my clothes neat. I pay for gas with cash and never stay in one place long enough to draw attention. The only evidence I leave behind are my tributes – my kills, strung up in the trees, a reminder that I'm not their friend.




The hunger is starting to grow again. It's been almost two weeks since my last hunt, and I can feel the familiar hollowness spreading through my brain. The whispers are getting louder, more insistent. They tell me it's time to move on, to find new hunting grounds. Tomorrow I'll head west, toward the vast forests of Oregon. 




Sometimes, in the quiet hours before dawn, I wonder if there is an escape from this, a way out of this torture. I'm driven by the same voices. I see signs occasionally – strange markings on trees, missing persons cases that feel familiar, stories traded in hushed voices at rural bars. 


Maybe someday our paths will cross, and I'll finally understand why it's following me.
But for now, I'll try to fight it and it's power, whatever it is. The moon is waning, but I can still feel its pull. The hunger grows stronger with each passing day, and the whispers tell me I'm getting closer to catching whatever it is… something I don't want to know. 


My bow rests on the passenger seat, my knives tucked safely under the driver's seat. Bloodstained.


I am not a killer…  though some call me one – I was born to be a doctor… not a hunter, chosen by whatever dark force that ruled the spaces between civilization and wilderness.


 But let me get this straight. I don't kill for pleasure or sport. I kill because if I don't, the hunger will consume me from the inside out, leaving nothing but an empty shell behind. A real monster.






Somewhere ahead, someone is hiking the lonely trail or possibly setting up camp in the growing darkness. The whispers came, telling me that it's just life, to kill.
and the whispers were right.


This is my story, my confession, my truth. If you're reading this, pray we never meet. Pray that I won't find you.


 Because once I do, there's no going back to the familiar warmth of your family, and friends. There's only death ahead“








We've been tracking this killer for months now. The blue F-150 has been spotted in three different states, always near where people go missing. Always near where we later find the body's, hung in trees. 


– his preferred weapons are hunting knives and a compound bow. More surprising, he wrote a note left at his last scene.


“ You're wasting your time “


But there's nothing fair about what he does. He treats people like game animals, tracking them for days before making his move. The forensic evidence suggests he sometimes follows his targets for over a week, learning their patterns, waiting for the perfect moment. Like a hunter studying prey.


The most terrifying part? We're no closer to catching him than we were when we started. He moves like a ghost through the wilderness, leaving no traces except his grisly displays. The profilers say he's organized, methodical, and completely detached from human emotion. They say he is guided by something.


I know he's still out there, watching from the shadows, waiting for his next victim. Sometimes, on long nights when the wind howls through the trees, I wonder if he's watching me too. If I'm just another potential trophy for his collection.


So consider this a warning. If you're traveling through the remote parts of the Northwest and you see a blue F-150 with a rusted hood, don't stop. Don't make eye contact. Just drive, and keep driving until you're back in civilization. Because the man is still hunting, not a friend, and to him, we're all just prey waiting to be strung up as a warning.


The most disturbing part? Deep down, I'm starting to think he's right about one thing – he's not human anymore. Whatever He used to be, died long ago, replaced by something that only looks human from a distance. Something that needs to kill to keep its heart beating.


And somewhere out there, under a moon, he's watching. Waiting. Hungry.

But I no longer found comfort in the familiar constellations. My name is Dr. Timothy Cole, senior astronomer, and I once considered myself lucky to spend my life peering into the mysteries of the cosmos. But that was before I found it — the thing that waits in the void, consuming all light, all hope.

I record this log not for posterity, but as a warning. If you hear it, then what we found is no longer confined to the darkness between the stars. It has found its way here, and you must understand what that means.

We thought we were prepared. We thought the James Webb Space Telescope would expand our horizons, show us new worlds, and perhaps — just perhaps — offer a glimpse into the existence of other sentient life. I believed in those possibilities more than anyone. For decades, I’ve spent countless nights at the observatory, meticulously collecting data, hungrily analyzing the secrets each star held.

And then, three weeks ago, we aimed the JWST at a distant point in the galaxy — a star labeled HD 1284. At first, it seemed unremarkable, just another pinprick of light hanging in the vast expanse. That is, until Sarah Brighton, my assistant, noticed something odd in the data.

“Sir,” she had said, voice tight with an edge of excitement, “there’s... an anomaly.”

I leaned over her workstation, my curiosity piqued. The screen showed HD 1284’s light curve — a normally steady pattern — dipping sharply at regular intervals. Every two Earth days, the star’s brightness would decrease by a noticeable percentage, as if something massive and opaque was crossing in front of it. Then, just as abruptly, the light would return to normal.

My heart began to race. A discovery like this was what astronomers *lived* for: a new planet, potentially, or a binary star system with a hidden companion. But then Sarah’s face twisted into a frown.

“It’s… it’s not just the light curve,” she said slowly, tapping at the keys. “I’m picking up fluctuations in the star’s mass and temperature.”

That gave me pause. I leaned in closer, staring at the data feed in disbelief. The star wasn’t just dimming. Its mass was fluctuating. That was *impossible* — stars don’t simply lose and regain mass like a balloon being inflated and deflated.

“Run the calculations again,” I ordered, my voice sharper than I intended. Sarah flinched but obeyed, fingers flying over the keyboard. We sat in tense silence, the hum of the equipment the only sound in the empty observatory. The numbers updated on the screen, confirming what we had already seen.

The fluctuations were real. Something was siphoning energy and mass from the star.

“It’s like… like something’s *eating* it,” Sarah whispered.

I recoiled at the suggestion, but I couldn’t deny what the data suggested. I felt a chill creep down my spine, a sensation I hadn’t experienced since I was a young researcher confronted by the unknowable depths of the universe for the first time. It wasn’t awe or wonder this time — it was *fear*.

“Let’s not jump to conclusions,” I murmured, more to convince myself than her. “There’s got to be a natural explanation. Dark matter, gravitational lensing — something we’re not considering.”

Sarah nodded, but her expression remained troubled. “What if it’s… I mean, what if it’s... *alive*?”

“Alive?” I scoffed, but the word lingered like a bad taste in my mouth. Stars are consumed all the time — by black holes, by neutron stars — but those are cold, mechanical processes. What she was suggesting was unthinkable: a predator that fed on stars like some cosmic parasite.

Still, we had to know more.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

We spent the next week analyzing every bit of data we could pull from the JWST, rerunning simulations and cross-checking our findings with other telescopes. It was grueling work, the kind that would normally excite me. But every time we dug deeper, the answers we found only led to more disturbing questions.

There were the dips in brightness, of course, growing longer and more pronounced as if whatever was consuming the star was becoming more aggressive. The mass fluctuations were harder to quantify, but it became clear that the star was being stripped, layer by layer, of its outer shell.

Then there was the temperature. As the star dimmed, its surface temperature dropped, a phenomenon that defied every known principle of astrophysics. Stars undergoing natural changes don’t cool down like that — not unless their core energy is being sucked out.

It was two weeks in when we got the first image.

I’ll never forget that moment. We’d managed to adjust the JWST’s infrared capabilities to focus on a smaller area, hoping to capture whatever was causing the fluctuations. The screen flickered, pixels aligning as the image slowly rendered. I leaned in, my breath held tight in my chest, and—

“*God*,” Sarah whispered, her hand flying to her mouth.

There, haloed by the dying light of HD 1284, was a shadow. No, not a shadow — a presence. A dark, amorphous mass, almost like a smear of ink on the fabric of space itself. It was larger than a planet, nebulous and shifting, its edges blurring into the void. It seemed… *fluid*, its form pulsing and rippling as if it were alive.

My skin prickled. I stared, unblinking, as the thing undulated, extending long, sinuous tendrils toward the star. They wrapped around the blazing sphere, and the star flickered — its light swallowed by the darkness. It was as if the star itself were being smothered by an entity too vast and incomprehensible to grasp.

“*Jesus*,” I said, my voice barely audible. “What… what the hell is that?”

“Should we report this?” Sarah asked, eyes wide.

I couldn’t answer. I felt paralyzed, staring at the thing devouring a star millions of times larger than Earth. To send this to NASA — to let the world know what we’d found — would change everything. I could already imagine the headlines: “*Predator Star Discovered!*” “*Unknown Entity Consuming Stellar Mass!*” But the implications…

I couldn’t help but feel that merely by observing it, by training our gaze on it, we were inviting its attention.

“I need more data,” I said finally, my voice hoarse. “If we report this now, they’ll dismiss it as a glitch. We need to confirm. We need—”

“What if it notices us?” Sarah interrupted, voice trembling.

“Don’t be ridiculous!” I snapped, but the words rang hollow. Because deep down, in the part of me that had always been most attuned to the cosmos, I felt a presence staring back through the lens — something aware and malevolent.

I turned off the monitor.

“It’s just a star,” I muttered. “We’re jumping at shadows.”

But even then, I knew it was a lie. I knew I would be back tomorrow, staring at that same screen, watching that same, terrible thing feeding.

Because something in the back of my mind whispered that we were no longer the observers.

We were the observed.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

A knock on my office door startled me from my thoughts. The sudden intrusion felt like a physical shock after so many hours of solitary focus. I turned, bleary-eyed, to see Sarah standing in the doorway, her face pale and tight with worry.

“Timothy,” she whispered, glancing nervously over her shoulder, “they’re waiting for you in the conference room. Dr. Ramirez just arrived.”

I felt a jolt of adrenaline. I hadn’t expected Elena to get involved so soon. Dr. Elena Ramirez, the director of the JWST project, was a formidable presence — brilliant, ambitious, and known for her no-nonsense approach. If she was here, it meant this was no longer a research curiosity. It was an emergency.

“Right,” I muttered, brushing my unkempt hair back and fumbling for my glasses. “Let’s go.”

The walk to the conference room felt like traversing a dark, lonely chasm. The usual hum of activity in the observatory was gone, replaced by an uneasy silence. I could feel the tension simmering in the air, the weight of too many sleepless nights bearing down on everyone. Something had shifted since our discovery of the Feeder. It wasn’t just the data or the unsettling images — it was the feeling that we were peering into something that should have remained hidden.

The room was small, with the blinds drawn tight, a single table surrounded by grim-faced scientists. Elena stood at the head, her arms crossed. Beside her, Dr. Michael Yates, the observatory’s chief physicist and my oldest friend, leaned back in his chair, staring thoughtfully at the blank screen in front of him. Opposite him was Dr. Ravi Singh, a cosmologist whose brilliance was matched only by his volatility.

“Timothy,” Elena said without preamble, fixing me with a sharp gaze as I took a seat. “Explain.”

I hesitated, glancing around the room. They were all waiting, their expressions a mix of curiosity and thinly veiled anxiety. I could feel Sarah’s presence at my side. We were standing on the precipice of something monumental, and I wasn’t sure if I could put it into words.

“We’ve been monitoring HD 1284,” I began, my voice steady despite the knot in my chest. “The fluctuations we detected in its brightness were unlike anything we’ve seen before. We initially thought it could be a planetary transit or some form of stellar instability, but… it’s not.”

I clicked a button on my laptop, and the monitor behind me flared to life, displaying the first image we’d captured of the entity. A murmur rippled through the room.

“This is what’s causing the anomaly,” I said quietly, gesturing to the dark, sinuous shape coiled around the star. “We believe it’s some kind of… entity, siphoning mass and energy from HD 1284. It’s feeding on the star.”

Dr. Singh let out a low whistle. “Feeding? You make it sound like it’s alive.”

“I don’t know if ‘alive’ is the right word,” I admitted. “But it’s certainly… behaving in a way that suggests purpose. We’ve ruled out gravitational lensing, dark matter, and any known astrophysical phenomena. Whatever this is, it doesn’t follow natural laws.”

Elena narrowed her eyes. “What’s its size?”

“Roughly the mass of Jupiter, though it’s hard to be precise. It doesn’t have a consistent shape. It shifts, like a fluid.” I paused, swallowing hard. “And it’s getting bigger.”

“How?” Michael leaned forward, his expression intense. “Where is it drawing mass from?”

“The star’s outer layers,” Sarah said, speaking up for the first time. Her voice trembled slightly. “It’s like a… a parasitic organism, latching on and draining it. And it’s not just light it’s consuming. The gravitational field around the star is warping in response, almost as if the entity is absorbing space-time itself.”

A heavy silence settled over the room. Ravi’s gaze flickered between me and Sarah, his mouth set in a grim line.

“Are you suggesting it’s a form of dark energy?” he asked.

“I’m suggesting,” I said slowly, choosing my words carefully, “that we’re dealing with something completely outside our understanding of physics. It doesn’t behave like a physical object, yet it exerts physical influence. It’s… predatory.”

Michael laughed, a dry, humorless sound. “A predator star? Come on, Tim. That’s absurd.”

“Is it?” I shot back, more forcefully than I intended. “Think about it. We’ve always assumed life to be bound by biological principles, but what if that’s just a limitation of our perception? What if there are forms of life out there that don’t fit our definitions? Forms that can thrive in the vacuum of space, that consume on a cosmic scale?”

“Enough!” Elena interrupted sharply. “We’re not here to speculate. I want concrete data, Timothy. What is this thing? What are its capabilities? And, most importantly, is it a threat?”

I hesitated. Was it a threat? My instincts screamed yes, but I had no evidence to back up that fear. The Feeder hadn’t shown any aggression — it was just… feeding. But there was something deeply unsettling in the way it moved, the way it reacted to the telescope’s gaze.

“There’s more,” I said softly. “When we focused the JWST on it, we detected a faint signal — a low-frequency hum that doesn’t correspond to any known natural emissions.”

Ravi sat up straighter, his eyes sharp. “A signal? You didn’t mention this before.”

“I wasn’t sure what to make of it,” I admitted. “It’s almost imperceptible, buried in the background noise. But it’s rhythmic, structured. Almost like—”

“Like communication?” Michael asked, his skepticism giving way to a glimmer of something darker. *Fear*.

“Yes,” I whispered. “Or a lure.”

Elena’s gaze hardened. “What do you mean?”

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to continue. “What if this isn’t the first star it’s consumed? What if it moves from one stellar system to another, draining stars of their energy? And what if the signal we picked up is a… a beacon? A way to attract other sentient beings, like us, to come and investigate?”

“And then it devours them, too,” Ravi finished quietly, his face pale.

“That’s insane,” Michael muttered, shaking his head. “Stars die all the time. Supernovae, black holes—”

“Not like this,” I interrupted. “Not this deliberately. I don’t think it’s just consuming the star. It’s baiting us. Drawing us in.”

Another heavy silence fell over the room. I could see the disbelief on their faces, the struggle to reconcile what I was saying with everything they knew about the universe. But there was something else, too — a flicker of doubt, of dread. Because if I was right…

“How long do we have?” Elena asked, her voice flat.

I stared at her, uncomprehending. “What do you mean?”

She looked at me as if I were a child. “If it’s aware of us, if it’s hunting… how long until it finds us?”

A shiver ran through me. I hadn’t thought that far ahead. The idea of the Feeder shifting its gaze from HD 1284 to Earth was too terrifying to contemplate. But as I opened my mouth to respond, Sarah let out a choked sound, her eyes wide with horror.

“Dr. Cole… look at the screen.”

We turned as one. The image on the monitor had changed. The Feeder, that dark, indefinite mass, was still coiled around the star — but it was no longer passive. It had shifted, its tendrils extended, reaching out as if… as if it were searching.

And then, slowly, deliberately, it twisted. The star’s light flared and dimmed again, a rhythmic pulse that sent a chill down my spine.

It was looking back at us.

“It knows,” I whispered.

The room exploded into chaos.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

My descent into obsession began that night. The chaos of the meeting quickly subsided, but the fear never left. We went our separate ways, each struggling to grasp what we had witnessed. Dr. Ramirez immediately ordered a lockdown on all research involving HD 1284, restricting access to the telescope and data files. No one was to discuss it, document it, or, God forbid, leak it to the public.

But I couldn’t stay away.

I spent the following days holed up in my office, staring at the high-resolution images we’d captured of the Feeder. I analyzed and reanalyzed the signal, listening to its rhythmic pulse until it was burned into my brain. There was something there, something hidden beneath the surface, just waiting to be uncovered. Sarah pleaded with me to take a break, to get some sleep, but I brushed her off, consumed by the need to understand.

What was it? How did it move? Why did it feel like it was aware of us?

I found myself waking up in a cold sweat every night, dreams haunted by shadowy tendrils coiling around stars, snuffing out their light. It was as if the Feeder was creeping closer, inching its way through the black void toward me. Each time I woke, gasping and shivering, I would rush back to the observatory, needing to confirm that it was still out there — still confined to the distant reaches of space.

And yet, every time I looked, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it had moved.

One night, I intercepted something new. I was reviewing the star’s emission spectra, trying to pick out any anomalies, when I noticed a faint spike — a barely perceptible fluctuation in the background noise.

I leaned closer. It was the same signal we’d picked up before, only… *different*. There was a new rhythm to it, a secondary pulse that reverberated through the first. I ran it through the analyzer, isolating the frequencies, and stared in disbelief as a pattern emerged.

It was mimicking our attempts to communicate.

“Sarah!” I called out, my voice hoarse from days of disuse. I hadn’t spoken to anyone in what felt like an eternity, lost in the world of data and static. But she was there — she was always there, lingering on the edges, watching me with those worried eyes.

She appeared in the doorway, a ghostly figure in the dim light. Her face was thinner, drawn, as if she hadn’t been sleeping either. I wondered if she, too, was feeling it — the pull of the Feeder, the irresistible urge to look deeper.

“What is it?” she asked quietly.

“Listen,” I whispered, turning the speakers up. The signal played softly, a low, haunting hum that seemed to vibrate through the air. It was hypnotic, almost melodic in its complexity, and I felt a strange comfort wash over me as I listened. It was the first time, in weeks, that I didn’t feel afraid.

“Is that… new?” she asked, stepping closer. I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.

“It’s responding to us,” I finally managed. “Every time we’ve sent a signal, every time we’ve tried to analyze it… it’s been listening. And now—” I pointed to the screen, where the twin pulses throbbed in perfect synchronization. “It’s mimicking our frequency. It’s trying to… to communicate.”

Sarah stiffened beside me. “Or it’s… learning.”

The words sent a shiver through me. *Learning*. Mimicking. *Adapting*. What if it wasn’t just responding out of curiosity? What if it was studying us, figuring out what made us tick, the way a predator studies the movements of its prey?

“What do we do?” she whispered. I turned to her, seeing the fear etched in her face, and felt a surge of protectiveness. She was too young for this, too innocent. She didn’t deserve to be drawn into the same madness that had ensnared me.

“We can’t stop now,” I said softly. “We’re too close. We need to keep watching, keep—”

“No,” she interrupted, shaking her head violently. “We need to stop, Timothy. This… this thing is manipulating us. Can’t you feel it?” Her voice broke, and she grabbed my arm, fingers digging into my flesh. “Every time we look at it, every time we send a signal, it’s like… like it’s reaching out. Like it’s wrapping itself around us.”

I wrenched my arm free, anger and frustration bubbling up. “You’re overreacting! It’s a phenomenon — a discovery. This is what we do, Sarah. We study. We learn.”

“Not this,” she murmured, stepping back, her face pale. “This isn’t science, Timothy. This is—” She trailed off, glancing around as if the shadows in the room were listening. “It’s *hungry*.”

The word echoed in the silence, hanging heavy in the air. *Hungry*. I wanted to laugh, to brush it off as paranoia, but something deep inside me recoiled. Was that what this was? Had we awakened something that shouldn’t have been disturbed? Something that was growing stronger the more we probed its secrets?

“I’m going to talk to Dr. Ramirez,” she said suddenly, her voice wavering. “This needs to stop.”

I surged to my feet. “No! You can’t — she’ll shut it all down. We need more time, more—”

“Look at yourself!” she cried, eyes blazing. “You’re falling apart! You don’t eat, you don’t sleep — you’ve become a slave to this thing, whatever it is. If we keep going, we’ll—”

“We’ll *what*?!” I snarled, fists clenched. “We’ll understand? We’ll finally see?”

“Or we’ll go mad,” she whispered. The words were soft, barely audible, but they cut through me like a knife. “Please, Timothy. Let it go.”

I stared at her, chest heaving, and for a moment — just a moment — I considered walking away. Letting the darkness swallow up the Feeder and forgetting we ever looked into the abyss. But then the signal pulsed again, throbbing through the room, and my resolve hardened.

I couldn’t stop. Not now. Not when I was so close.

“You do what you want,” I muttered, turning back to my laptop. “But I’m staying.”

She was silent for a long time, and I refused to look at her. I couldn’t. If I did, I might waver and turn back.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered finally, and I heard the soft click of the door closing behind her.

I didn’t see her again for three days.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I kept working, alone in the silent observatory. I slept in my office, surrounded by screens filled with data feeds and looping video of the Feeder’s dark, undulating mass. I ate when I remembered to, hardly tasting the cold sandwiches and stale coffee I scrounged from the break room. Time blurred, days and nights melding into a single, endless vigil.

And all the while, the Feeder watched.

It wasn’t just paranoia. I could feel it. Every time I adjusted the telescope, every time I narrowed the focus to get a clearer image, it would shift, its tendrils flaring outward, reaching toward the lens. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, but I knew what I was seeing.

It was reacting to me.

It was responding.

And it was getting *closer*.

The thought made my skin crawl, but I couldn’t look away. I stayed glued to the screens, cataloging every flicker, every movement, every tiny variation in the signal’s pattern. It was speaking to me — I was *sure* of it. There was a message buried in the hum, a meaning just beyond my grasp.

I was close. *So* close.

Then, on the third night, it happened.

I was running the latest batch of images through the analyzer when the signal suddenly spiked, a sharp burst of energy that sent my equipment whirring in alarm. I scrambled to adjust the settings and watched as the Feeder’s dark mass seemed to expand, swallowing the star completely.

The room vibrated with a low, thrumming hum, the sound reverberating through my skull. I gasped, clutching the edge of the desk, my vision blurring as the signal intensified. It was everywhere, filling the room, the observatory, the entire world—

And then, just as suddenly, it stopped.

I blinked. The screens went dark, the equipment falling silent. I stared at the blank monitors, my mind racing.

“What… what the hell just happened?”

The silence stretched on for what seemed like an eternity. Then, finally, I reached out, trembling fingers hovering over the keyboard.

That’s when a single word appeared on the main screen, typed out in stark, white letters:

*HELLO.*
