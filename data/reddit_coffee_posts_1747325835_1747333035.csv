Last year my apartment in Dallas was inundated with gnats from the middle of April until Nov. Pest control came out so many times. My neighbors had some, but not to the same extent. It just picked up again a few days ago. Here’s what we did last year and now: The apartment was bombed (lasted maybe 24 hours), I still have multiple light traps up, I still have ACV traps out, my drains have been plugged at all times when not in use since last summer, drain cleaners were used, boiling water poured down the drains, they checked for AC leaks, fridge leaks, garbage disposal, pipe leaks, fridge drain pain (there were some dead ones in the fridge). I don’t keep any open food out and definitely no produce. I keep my apartment cold and use a dehumidifier. I am doing EVERYTHING possible to get rid of them and it’s not working. They’re in my face when I’m working, on my coffee table, they even land on me when I’m sitting on the couch.  What else can I do? How can I find out where they’re coming from?

Then I realized I was getting swollen every day and I looked up the brand jovial because I was using their chickpeas on a regular basis, well it turns out they have wheat present in their facility too so I had to give that up. Honestly I can keep going but it's depressing and I'm so tired of being swollen from food that shouldn't get me sick and it's so hard to find things that are actually safe and I've never felt so fucking defeated. I've had celiac for 12 years and whenever I eat purely whole plant based (I'm vegan) and zero processed I am healthy again but it's so upsetting that nuts, beans and plant based milks all have wheat present in facilities. It's driving me insane and I can't keep eliminating everything I'm so sad.

1knf7am,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1knf7am/homeschool_or_not_gifted_autistic_1st_grader/,Homeschool or Not? Gifted Autistic 1st Grader.,"We need to decide within the next month whether to homeschool our soon-to-be 1st grader.

**Background:**  
Our son started kindergarten at a great public school last fall and did well for the first month (although he was non-verbal and immobile at pickup), but then became very dysregulated and aggressive (mostly toward peers), to the point that he couldn't remain in class. While he'd shown similar behaviors in preschool, this was more extreme. A rushed but very comprehensive neuropsych evaluation diagnosed him with autism and a high IQ (138). We believe the school environment and social demands overwhelmed him—especially without a trusted adult to help co-regulate. Four after school nannies quit due to his behavior which became severe due to the stress of his school day, so I now care for him in the afternoons. We stayed in school because the staff responded with really wonderful support, including a 1:1 aide, and his school behavior improved immediately. He's had no significant aggression since November. We just signed an IEP for 1st grade that reduces this support to a shared aide for about half the day (down from roughly ¾ of the day with a 1:1) but he will get minimal other interventions - 1 hour of OT a month, 1 hour of speech a week, and thats about it.

**Reasons to Stay in School:**

* He’s developed a strong connection to his school and feels proud to be part of the community.
* Developmentally, he may be more ready for school in 1st grade than he was for kindergarten.
* I’m not a great teacher. I have ADHD and possibly autistic as well, struggle with organization, and am not especially social. I will probably struggle to be an amazing home school mom, but I have an interest in trying. 
* He started K without any academic background and is now breezily meeting standards. Academics are going fine.
* My job is demanding, though very flexible. I am often over-whelmed by juggling my life's obligations. Home school might not be too much worse than it is now since I am already picking him up early 2 days a week for DIR/Floortime and Speech and caring for him in the afternoons, but it likely won't be less stressful unless his behavior gets much less taxing at home.
* He’s just started making real progress socially—playing a sport at lunch with older kids, tolerating the noisy chaotic yards at recess, and developing friendships with children who seek him out and request his company. Previously, he spent basically all his time at school away from peers with adults, which suited him practically as he tends to prefer adult company, but I know he longed for social intimacy with peers.

**Reasons to Homeschool:**

* He’s intensely curious and asks deep, thoughtful questions out of the blue. Like, ""How does mirror magnification work on the 2x side of a small mirror?"" ""How can we see Jupiter if it's made of gas and we can't see gas?"" ""Can you see atoms in a microscope?"" ""How does anesthesia actually work?"" I want him to have an education that fosters and protects this curiosity. I’m concerned that school may be dimming that spark. He asks less now than he used to and he is often frustrated and shut down in the afternoons.
* He loves adventures, novelty and learning. We pour over National Geographic coffee table books. He loves listening to audiobooks and loves asking questions. He is a great candidate for unschooling.
* We’ve secured a spot in a homeschool charter that offers around $5,000 in funds for student enrichment. I have come up with a good tentative schedule: 2 days at a farm school, 1 day of hands-on science at our local zoo, and time with me, a nanny, and drop-in enrichment classes.
* School is hard on him. He's irritable and exhausted at the end of the day.  
* I’m concerned the new IEP support might not be sufficient. I suspect he may have “pathological demand avoidance,” which makes rigid routines hard for him to tolerate. His speech language pathologist at school is pushing him hard on neurotypical social skills in a way that might backfire. This year worked well largely because the school staff really ""got"" him and gave him so much love—but next year is a question mark. 
* If 1st grade doesn’t go well, we can’t join the charter mid-year and access the funds. I am also concerned that a mid-year withdrawal from school might be emotionally disruptive. Both of these schools - the in-person and home school charter - are both impacted so mid-year transitions aren't likely and its possible we won't be able to get back in for second grade. 
* I worry that staying in school may stifle his curiosity and capacity for learning and that we will be able to better foster his curiosity and meet him at the right level at home. 

Right now, it feels wrong to pull him just as he's making social strides and feeling so much community at school. But I also worry that keeping him in will stifle his deep curiosity and that the burden of coping with the school environment is unnecessary and reduces his quality of life. And that if we regress in 1st, we will have missed out on the best homeschooling path.

1knf6e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1knf6e9/gap_year_or_full_time_employment/,Gap year or Full time employment,"Just finished a computer science (specialised in software engineering) degree at a Russel group university. As most people do, I hated every second of the academic side of it, like REALLY hated it. It really knocked my passion for computer science, leaving me with little interest in it. This wasn’t due to the difficulty but more so the quality of teaching.

Essentially, I want a break before I head into a CS role. I’m still 22 and feel like I’ve still got other things in my life to sort - losing some weight, picking up some new hobbies, sorting out my drinking habits (probably worth a whole other post), and travelling.

The issue is that I don’t really get the privilege of taking it easy. I’m from a very working class background, and will be moving back into my small family home in a poor quality area. On top of my degree, over the past three years, I have worked 2 jobs (even having a third job during second year) to fund things. Unlike basically all of my uni mates, my parents can’t pay for me to do and have nice things. I don’t mind this, and feel prideful that I’ve been able to take care of myself. 

My parents and wider family are very much pushing me to go into full time employment with my degree, being upset at me for not sorting a graduation job already. I understand this as my older brother similarly graduated 5 years ago and hasn’t had a job since, becoming unfathomably lazy (again, probably worth a whole other post). I argue that my situation is different seeing as I have savings and I still plan to work my two jobs (bartending + coffee shop, ~35 hours a week). 

I truthfully feel so wounded by the intensity of the past 3 years, and with how many responsibilities I’ve had to balance. I just dream of being clearheaded again and finally being able travel, pick up some new hobbies, learn some new skills, etc… My parents argue that a proper full time job in my degree is the most mature thing to do but when I tell them that I can start that career path whenever I want they fear I’ll turn out like my brother and I understand their concerns.

I just need some more perspectives on this, if I speak to the more wise and elder influences in my life they tell me to listen to my parents. When I speak to others closer to my own age, or who have had similar situations to me they agree to take it easy on myself.

Like Ooh Ah felt fun and refreshing despite being a ""horror"" MV. I remember joking with people about the teasers - [I'm the zombie in the Jihyo teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgMDwGaD3cQ) b4 coffee lol - and it got me really curious about the group. Momo's dance break really hit me, and I loved Clumsy Sana.

Cheer Up - loved the movie references, even though I didn't even know all the movies. I think they managed to pick films that encompassed a few genres.

TT - The different costumes were really fun, even though each member was in their own genre it still felt cohesive because of the Halloween theme. I have used Demon Baby Nayeon GIF in a lot of online convos heh...

I did enjoy Likey & DTNA, though not as much as the ones above - wish they'd leaned a little more into the hinted horror lore for the latter. Fancy I liked though it started that feeling of the MVs just having more random scenes. I did like AF as I liked the song and the MV perfectly worked with the feeling of Taste of Love which is one of my top Twice album choices.

I like the Japanese MVs, but I think Doughnut is my favorite because it's just so weird in a good way and has what feels like a connected story between the shots. Fake & True also seems to have a story, so probably why that's another favorite MV.

The last 3 not so great. I've been trying to make it work and I do believe he has love for me still, But  safe to say things have changed. My concern here is that about a year ago he started leaving for work 2 to 3 hours early every single day. Note as well that he works 7 to 10 minute drive away for where we live. He claims that he just likes to get some coffee and play on his steam deck before clocking in for his shift. I believe him sorta but sometimes I get in my head about it. He also tends to rush out of the house as if he's go to be late even tho his shift doesn't even start for 3 hours! 

I'm not trying to be an untrusting gf but when things seem odd how can I not speculate. It might also be different if I felt like he still wanted this. I'm the beginning when I felt love from him I was never with doubts or jealousy because I felt secure. Hes lost interest in me over time and I think he just expected things to always stay in that ""beautiful honeymoon phase"" of early relationship bliss and when I didn't meet those expectations he realized maybe he wants different. And yet won't leave even tho I've told him he's free to leave. It's all deeper and confusing more but the main question I have here is am I in the wrong for thinking this is odd behavior? Is he cheating? Should I just leave it alone and not bug him about it? He's even said things before like ""you can come with me and see what I'm doing"" I don't want to do that or follow him lol I'm not a stalker lol I just want to understand why. 

He says that he has a lot of anxiety since his father passed away and I'm trying sooo hard to be his place of safety and comfort but for whatever reason he's never leaned on me like that. He'd rather go sit in a cold wearhouse to drink coffee and play video games. He comes home on the dot everyday and I have no other reason to think he's cheating.

hopefully this thread can help alleviate some concerns for anyone on the fence about getting it done.

last thursday i smoked some weed and got snacky, so i ate some saltine crackers and applesauce before bed. big mistake, apparently? this caused an agonizing attack on friday morning that left me with a dull ache in my right side for the next 24 hours. it fluctuated between being somewhat bearable and feeling like my whole ribcage was on fire. on saturday, i said enough is enough and went to the ER. i assumed since the pain was bearable it was fine, but hurting for this long was NOT normal for me. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY. IF SOMETHING IS WRONG, GO TO THE ER.

the radiologist took one look on the ultrasound and saw that the stone was MASSIVE (3.5cm) and was in the neck of my gallbladder. while it was not lodged in the bile duct, it was starting to prevent bile from flowing because it essentially blocked the entire opening to the GB. the surgeon said that my GB was almost twice the size it should have been due to inflammation and pooling bile.

i had an attack right in the room and morphine did nothing to curb the pain. they wheeled me into a room immediately and i got same day emergency surgery. i’ll be real, it was deeply unpleasant being poked and prodded and i was really afraid considering my last experiences with a surgery and anesthesia were not the best. i’ve had a tonsillectomy that resulted in hemorrhaging for days, and i lost 25lbs in the weeks following due to not being able to eat. i was terrified that this was going to be just as painful.

this surgeon was night and day compared to my consult doctor in terms of compassion and understanding of the situation. please, please, please find someone who understands how much pain you are in! he calmly answered all my questions and told me that i could trust him and let him do his job. i asked if i could keep the stone, which unfortunately i could not because they send them in for biopsy, but he DID offer to take pictures during the surgery for me.

i woke up post-op and those photo printouts were on my lap. i felt a little sore and anxious from the anesthesia, and my throat was really dry from the breathing tube. they gave me ice chips and let me rest for about 20 minutes before wheeling me back upstairs to my room. i stayed overnight in the hospital, which i know isn’t routine but it was a decision i don’t regret. the first night was hard on my body and i was struggling to get up and eat/drink because the anesthesia kept making me vomit. i was very weak but not in pain.

i was discharged the next afternoon, and going back home i found that i was still not in any pain. they gave me a prescription for heavy duty painkillers, but all i’ve really needed for the abdominal soreness is tylenol or ibuprofen which i take once or twice a day. i’ve been walking and eating with ZERO issue! the only difficulty i’ve had is getting up from lying down, but i get stronger every day.

it’s day five, and i’m able to eat whatever i want! the only thing that gave me tummy upset was a grilled cheese, which i should have held off on anyways considering i’m lactose intolerant. i’ve had a breakfast burrito with egg, hashbrowns, and avocado, falafel and hummus, vegan meatballs and mashed potatoes, a flatbread with arugula and balsamic, and coffee. all of these foods would have 100% triggered an attack beforehand, but i have NO problems anymore! it’s such a relief.

tmi for bathroom related topics: pooping was a struggle, but i have been taking fiber supplements since day one and it’s been a big help. on day three my girlfriend drove me to TJ maxx and got me a mcdonald’s iced coffee just because those are my regular poop triggers and it hit me the second i got home, haha. it’s moving more slowly than before, which in a way is good because i struggle with IBS-D and had diarrhea multiple times a week prior to surgery. it’s almost like it reversed my bad bathroom habits and my GI tract is relieved of its issues.

i’m hoping that this upward trend continues, but so far things have been amazing and i’m so glad i did this surgery. i know that i will not regret a second of it based on how it’s been changing my life five days in!",1,1747332357.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

Even if someone did sneeze on me, let's say at work, my first response wouldn't be to start swinging, I'd be grossed out and probably a little agitated but at the end of the day humans make mistakes and most of them don't warrant a hand to the face. I remember after she backhanded me I was on the ground and my glasses were no longer on my face. It all happened so fast and I didn't even realize I had sneezed on her until she was screaming bloody murder that I sneezed on her. She also had the audacity to tell me to get off the ground and that she ""didn't hit me that hard""

[https://www.plantedshack.com/15-chic-neutral-coastal-living-room-ideas-you-will-love/](https://www.plantedshack.com/15-chic-neutral-coastal-living-room-ideas-you-will-love/)

  
Coastal living rooms exude a certain charm that brings the tranquility of the sea indoors. With their breezy colors and relaxed vibes, they’re perfect for evoking memories of beach vacations and calm seaside afternoons. Incorporating neutral tones into your coastal living room can elevate its aesthetic, creating a soothing environment that feels both sophisticated and inviting. Here are 15 chic neutral coastal living room ideas to inspire your next home transformation.

  
1. Soft White and Sandy Beige Palettes

  
One of the simplest yet most impactful ways to achieve a coastal look is by using a palette of soft whites and sandy beiges. These colors mimic the beach’s natural beauty.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Paint your walls a soft white and choose a sandy beige for your couch and cushions. Incorporate natural textures with jute rugs.

  
2. Driftwood Accents

  
Driftwood is a cornerstone of coastal decor, adding a rustic charm that perfectly complements neutral tones.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Use driftwood for shelves, coffee tables, or even as wall art. Enhance with soft white decor pieces for contrast.

  
3. Light Linen Textiles

  
Linen is known for its breezy and relaxed vibe, making it a fantastic fabric choice for a coastal living room.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Opt for light linen curtains and throw pillows in muted colors. This will let in plenty of natural light while providing a soft touch.

  
4. Natural Fiber Rugs

  
Incorporate natural fiber rugs like jute or sisal for a grounding element in your living room.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Choose a large jute rug that fits underneath your seating area. Pair it with neutral-toned sofas and a light-colored coffee table for balance.

  
5. Subtle Marine-Inspired Decor

  
Bring a hint of the ocean directly into your living space with subtle marine-themed decor.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Use elements such as shell accents, starfish knick-knacks, or coral designs, all in neutral shades, to enhance the coastal vibe.

  
6. Coastal-inspired Wall Art

  
Artwork that reflects coastal themes can tie your entire room together while keeping the color scheme neutral.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Look for abstract prints of ocean waves or beach scenes. Frame them in light wood for a clean look.

  
7. Light Wood Furniture

  
Light wood furniture brings warmth and simplicity, enhancing the airy feeling of a coastal living room.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Choose furniture pieces like oak coffee tables or beach-style cabinetry that maintain a light, neutral color palette.

  
8. Breezy Window Treatments

  
Let’s not forget the role of window treatments in creating a bright, welcoming atmosphere.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Use sheer white curtains that flutter in the breeze. They allow natural light while providing a beachy feel.

  
9. Statement Lighting Fixtures

  
A statement lighting fixture can serve as an eye-catching focal point that reinforces your coastal decor.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Opt for a large, driftwood-style chandelier or a pendant light with a nautical design in neutral tones.

  
10. Open and Airy Layout

  
A coastal living room should feel open and breezy, allowing for the flow of air and light.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Arrange your furniture to create an inviting conversational area. Keep pathways clear, and avoid overcrowding with items.

  
11. Indoor Plants

  
Add a touch of greenery to bring life into your neutral coastal space.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Use potted plants like snake plants or succulents in neutral-colored pots. These low-maintenance plants thrive indoors while enhancing air quality.

  
12. Subdued Accent Colors

  
Introduce soft accent colors to add depth without overwhelming the neutral palette.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Incorporate accents in soft blues or greens through decorative pillows, throws, or art.

  
13. Layered Textures

  
Layering different textures adds interest while maintaining a calm, neutral aesthetic.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Mix and match materials like wool throws, cotton pillows, and a wicker basket for storage. Each texture contributes to a cozy atmosphere.

  
14. Coastal-inspired Coffee Tables

  
A coffee table can serve as both a functional piece and a style statement in your living room.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Select a coffee table made from reclaimed wood or washed oak to incorporate natural elements reminiscent of the shore.

  
15. Anchors and Nautical Symbols

  
Subtle nautical symbols can add a playful touch to your coastal-themed room.

  
How to Achieve the Look

  
: Use anchor motifs in throw pillows or artwork. Choose items in neutral colors to maintain a cohesive look.

  
Conclusion

  
Creating a chic neutral coastal living room is all about balance. By incorporating soft colors, natural textures, and elements inspired by the sea, you can transform your space into a serene retreat. Whether it’s through breezy textiles, sustainable driftwood accents, or simply keeping the layout open and airy, these 15 ideas provide a variety of ways to embrace the beauty of coastal style. Dive into your decorating project and enjoy crafting a living space that resonates with peace and relaxation.

For the purpose of this post, we define good retirement locations as:

* Prefer a location with a population in the 5,000 to 10,000 range but we are flexible.
* Looking for older homes, say built in 1940 or before, in the $300-$700K range with a front porch
* Homes are within walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants, bars, entertainment, grocery stores
* Someplace relatively quiet and safe
* In a perfect world the town/neighborhood has a fair number of mature trees
* Roughly, no more than a 2 hour drive to Madison

We have previously checked out Monroe, New Glarus, Stoughton, Spring Green, Viroqua, La Crosse, Baraboo, Shorewood, Whitefish Bay and the Upper East Side of Milwaukee. You don't seem to get much for your money in Madison and traffic, etc. seems to be getting worse, but tradeoffs can be made for the right neighborhood.

  
We are heading to Wisconsin in July to look at more places. Any suggestions for locations we should check out??

I cant stand metformin now as it immediately give me stomach problems, I am tired all the time. I have a difficult job, and 2 hour commute, but this menstrual problems were from childhood. Also, I had constipation all my life, now it's a little better. I have pretty standard diet. Which is 2 bran/whole grain slice in morning with an 1/2 eggs, and a little chicken/mutton/pulses/vegetables. For lunch one grain roti with salan, and same at night. I eat fruits too. No coffee, tea, cold drinks. Fast food once a week on Saturday night. Lots of water throughout my day. No milk, milkshakes. I am tired. I feel tiredness in my body, in my mind. I have hair on my chest and face, even though testosterone test is always normal. My mind is like weak now. I can’t focus, I try so hard to like do a course regarding my field but I can't. Sometimes, I get so much constipation, I went to a couple of gastroenterologists too, but one said IBS, other said slow transit constipation. What do I do, which type of doctor I see. I have seen gynecologists and endocrinologists, and they all say birth control or Diance 35. I also went to a nutritionist and when I told her all my problems, she suggested me a very vegetable-oriented diet. The breakfast was cabbage omelet, with like half cabbage and 2 eggs and some other veggies. This was like in 2020.. I ate that breakfast for fiber to relieve constipation for several years, and then recently when I went to the gastroenterologist he said that patients with stomach problems should not eat cabbage. The other one said it’s safe. I don’t understand which doctor to follow or not. I am 27 years old. I don’t want to be infertile or diabetic.

I ate that breakfast for fiber to relieve constipation for several years, and then recently when I went to the gastroenterologist he said that patients with stomach problems should not eat cabbage. The other one said it’s safe. I don’t understand which doctor to follow or not. I am 27 years old. I don’t want to be infertile or diabetic. But till date I don’t think I have been able to have a period on my own.

 what should I do?

PS: I live in Pakistan, so not all the types of doctors, medicines, therapies, or supplements which you people have would be easily accessible/affordable here.

1knelkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1knelkt/the_mesa/,The Mesa,"At twenty-nine, John Brown felt the pull of the open road like a physical force. For months, he'd been a leaf on the wind, hitchhiking across the country, shedding the weight of his former life with every mile marker that blurred past. The road had finally led him to Taos, New Mexico. The small town appeared, dusty and quiet, pleasant enough but not immediately remarkable. His latest ride, a gruff trucker heading north, dropped him in the gravel lot of a coffee shop called ""The Bean,"" perched right on the edge of town.  
  
Stepping out, John stretched his legs, the dry New Mexico air cool against his skin. His eyes fell upon an older man sitting near the entrance, his face weathered like ancient stone, framed by striking, long white dreadlocks. This was Two Ravens. Their eyes met, and a silent acknowledgment passed between them. Two Ravens offered a nod, then a quiet invitation – he was heading to a place called The Mesa, and John was welcome to join.  
  
Intrigued, John accepted. They left the pavement behind, driving deeper into the landscape. The Mesa unfolded before them – a vast, flat scrubland dotted with resilient sagebrush, nestled between two modest mountains the natives called Grandmother and Grandfather mountain. It wasn't a town in the conventional sense, but a community, spread out under the wide sky, living without the hum of electricity or the flow of municipal water. As they traveled, Two Ravens spoke softly, weaving tales of the ancient pueblo history, his voice resonant with respect for the land and the spirits that inhabited it.  
  
Soon, John was introduced to the community. Among them was Cowboy, a man whose rough exterior hinted at a life lived hard under the sun. Cowboy, seeing the newcomer, offered John a place to stay – a small, extra cabin. It was simple, but the presence of a wood stove was a welcome sight as the late-winter chill still clung to the air, especially at this elevation.  
  
The first few days were an adjustment, the thin air and cold nights demanding a different kind of rhythm. But John was used to adapting. He began to see where he could be useful. There was an old, unused building, dusty and quiet. John saw potential. He started cleaning it out, envisioning a space for the community. It became a hub, a place to organize donated food, ensuring those who needed it most could access it. And as the sun began to dip below the horizon each evening, the building would fill with the aroma of cooking. John took on the task of preparing a daily meal, a warm, shared moment for the residents of The Mesa.  
  
He met a fascinating array of characters. There was the quiet wisdom of Two Ravens, the gruff kindness of Cowboy, and others with names that seemed to fit their essence. One man, the local welder and mechanic, was simply known as ""Lost."" It became a running joke; when someone needed a repair, they'd say they had to ""get Lost.""  
  
Each night, after the last bowl was scraped clean and the laughter faded into the quiet desert air, John would begin the cleanup. Scraps, peelings, and leftover bits of food were gathered carefully. He carried the bin outside, the cool night air raising goosebumps on his arms, and dumped the food into the compost bin.  
  
Early summer arrived on The Mesa, bringing warmer days and cool, clear nights. The sagebrush held the heat of the sun long after it had set, releasing a dry, fragrant perfume into the darkness. John had finished cleaning up after the evening meal, the last traces of food safely in the compost bin, and started the walk back to his small cabin. The dirt road was little more than a faint track under the star-strewn sky, the moon a thin sliver offering minimal light. The silence of the desert night was usually a comfort, punctuated only by the distant cry of a coyote or the rustle of unseen creatures.  
  
Tonight, however, the silence was broken by a low growl, followed by the padding of multiple paws on the dry earth. John froze. Emerging from the deeper shadows at the edge of the road was a pack of feral dogs. Their eyes gleamed in the faint light, a menacing glint that sent a shiver down his spine. The lead dog was immense, a massive, shaggy white Great Pyrenees, easily nearing two hundred pounds. It lowered its head, digging its front paws into the dirt, snorting and rutting the ground like a bull preparing to charge.  
  
Fear, cold and sharp, pierced through John, but he forced himself to remain steady. He didn't back away, didn't make any sudden movements. His eyes stayed locked on the massive white dog. Slowly, deliberately, he knelt down, his hand sweeping across the rough ground, searching desperately for a rock, a sturdy stick, anything he could use to defend himself. The growl intensified, a deep rumble in the chest of the lead dog.  
  
Then, with a sudden burst of speed, the Great Pyrenees lunged. Time seemed to slow. Just as the massive dog was upon him, there was a blur of motion from the sagebrush to John's left. A sharp, surprised yelp cut through the night air as the Great Pyrenees, mid-lunge, was struck from the side. The huge dog rolled across the dirt road with a startled cry, scrambling back to its feet, disoriented. It shook its massive head once, then, tucking its tail, it bolted off into the darkness, its pack following quickly behind, their menacing presence dissolving back into the night.  
  
John, heart hammering against his ribs, slowly rose to his feet. He looked towards where the blur had come from. Standing there, panting softly, was a dog. At first glance, it looked somewhat like a smaller, lankier German Shepherd, but something was off. Its build was too lean, its movements too fluid, its eyes holding an intelligence that felt… different. Whatever this dog was, it seemed entirely pleased with itself, sitting calmly, head cocked, just watching John.  
  
A wave of realization washed over John. This dog, this strange, unassuming creature, had just saved his life. Without hesitation, he held out his hand, palm up, and softly said, ""Here boy."" He made a gentle clicking sound with his mouth. The dog didn't flinch, didn't show an ounce of fear. It simply walked right up to him, its tail giving a tentative wag, and allowed John to pet its head.  
  
From that night on, this forty-pound dog became John's shadow. It followed him everywhere, a quiet, constant companion. But there was a strange condition to their bond: the dog only appeared when they were alone. If anyone else came within earshot, the dog would simply vanish, melting back into the landscape like a ghost. John would try to tell his friends, the people of The Mesa, about the dog that didn't quite look like a dog, the one that had saved him. But no one ever saw it, and soon, they stopped believing him. The mysterious protector remained John's secret, a silent guardian of the high desert night.  
  
Weeks turned into months on The Mesa, the early summer heat settling in. John found a rhythm in the days, a quiet satisfaction in the work he was doing. The community center he'd helped establish became a vital hub, a place where people could find food, warmth, and connection. He continued to cook the evening meal, finding joy in nourishing the people who had welcomed him. He learned more names, heard more stories, and felt the subtle, deep pulse of life in this unique place.  
  
And always, there was Sketch. The lean, mysterious dog remained his constant, silent companion. It would appear as if from nowhere when John was alone, trotting faithfully by his side during walks, sitting patiently while he worked, or simply lying near the cabin door. But the moment another person approached, even if they were still a hundred yards away, Sketch would simply disappear, melting back into the sagebrush and shadows as if he'd never been there. John had started calling him ""Sketch"" because he was like a faint outline, always there but never quite solid enough for others to see.  
  
One evening, as the sky above The Mesa began to deepen into shades of orange and purple, the community gathered for the meal. The air was filled with the scent of roasting vegetables and woodsmoke. John was talking, recounting a strange moment from earlier in the day when he was sure Sketch had nudged a fallen tool back towards him. He laughed, shaking his head, ""I swear, this dog, Sketch, he's the smartest, most invisible dog I've ever met.""  
  
A few people chuckled, others exchanged knowing glances. They'd heard John's stories about his phantom dog before. They liked John, respected his work, but the dog... well, they just hadn't seen it. It was a friendly mystery they indulged him in.  
  
Suddenly, a hush fell over the gathering. Two Ravens had arrived, his presence commanding a quiet respect. He moved with a slow, deliberate grace, his long white dreadlocks catching the fading light. He accepted a plate of food and listened for a moment to the tail end of John's story about Sketch.  
  
Then, in his deep, resonant voice, Two Ravens spoke. ""John is telling the truth,"" he said, his gaze sweeping across the faces of the assembled community. A ripple of surprise went through the crowd. Two Ravens rarely spoke on such matters, and his words carried weight. ""I have been watching from the top of Grandmother Mountain,"" he continued, ""with my binoculars, I can see the whole mesa. That Coyote has been following John for months. Follows him everywhere he goes.""  
  
Silence descended, heavy and absolute. Coyote. Not a dog. And Two Ravens had seen him. From Grandmother Mountain. The elder had confirmed it. Their disbelief evaporated, replaced by a profound sense of wonder and acceptance. If Two Ravens said it was so, then it was.  
  
Two Ravens turned his gaze to John, his eyes holding a depth of understanding. ""John,"" he said, his voice softer now, but still clear, ""come with me in the morning, at dawn. To the top of Grandmother Mountain. We will join in a sweat-lodge. To learn your path with the spirits.""  
  
The invitation hung in the air, potent and significant. John looked at Two Ravens, then out towards the dark outline of Grandmother Mountain against the twilight sky. His path. With the spirits. He nodded, a sense of destiny settling over him. ""Yes,"" he replied, his voice barely a whisper. ""I will come.""  
  
The first light of dawn painted the eastern sky in soft hues of rose and gold as John met Two Ravens at the base of Grandmother Mountain. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the faint scent of pine and damp earth. The climb was steady, Two Ravens moving with a quiet strength that belied his age, John following his lead, his breath misting in the cool air. As they ascended, the view of The Mesa unfolded below them, a vast tapestry of sagebrush and shadow bathed in the nascent light.  
  
Reaching the summit, the panorama was breathtaking. The entire sweep of the landscape was visible – the flat expanse of The Mesa, the distant peaks, the winding arroyos. It felt like standing on the roof of the world. There, near a cluster of rocks, stood a low, rugged structure, built from woven sagebrush and sturdy Pinion tree branches. Smoke, thin and fragrant, curled softly from a small opening. This was the sweat-lodge.  
  
Two Ravens turned to John, his face serene in the morning light. He held out a simple clay cup. ""Drink,"" he said, his voice a low murmur. The tea was warm, earthy, with an unfamiliar, slightly bitter taste. John drank, feeling a subtle warmth spread through him. Silently, they ducked low and entered the sweat-lodge, the entrance closing behind them, plunging them into a warm, dark, and humid space filled with the steam rising from heated stones.  
  
The heat intensified, pressing in on John. The air grew thick with steam and the scent of herbs. Time began to lose its meaning. His thoughts drifted, the boundaries of his mind softening. A strange stupor settled over him, and the darkness behind his eyelids began to swirl.  
  
He saw a path, shimmering faintly in the darkness, winding its way through an endless field of sage, leading upwards towards an unseen peak. Then, from the deep shadows at the top of the path, a figure emerged, loping down with effortless grace. It was a coyote, its form both solid and ethereal. It reached him, its eyes ancient and knowing, and dropped a single, smooth bone at his feet before turning and melting back into the darkness from which it came.  
  
The world spun. The sweat-lodge seemed to dissolve around him. He was floating in a vast, cosmic darkness, illuminated by shimmering threads of light. And there, immense and ancient, was Grandmother Spider, her eight eyes fixed on him, her delicate, powerful legs weaving a web of shimmering strands. He watched, mesmerized, as she wove, her threads connecting him to the coyote, binding their essences together in an intricate, luminous pattern. The vision was overwhelming, a sense of deep connection and ancient power washing over him.  
  
He gasped, snapping back to the reality of the sweat-lodge, the heat still intense, the air thick. He was kneeling, sweat pouring from him. He looked at Two Ravens, who sat calmly, his eyes open, watching him with quiet patience. The light filtering in from the small opening was different. It was the soft glow of late afternoon. A whole day had passed.  
  
Trembling slightly, John recounted his vision, the path, the coyote, the bone, the spinning world, Grandmother Spider weaving her web, binding him to the coyote. Two Ravens listened, his expression one of deep understanding.  
  
When John finished, Two Ravens nodded slowly. ""What you saw was not a dream, John,"" he said, his voice gentle but firm. ""You were chosen. Chosen by the Great Coyote spirit. The one who follows you, the one you call Sketch... he is not just a dog. He is a powerful spirit, a messenger, a guide.""  
  
Two Ravens looked at John, his eyes holding a new recognition. ""From this day,"" he said, ""you will be known by a different name among us. You are Ma'ii yił bish."" He paused, letting the words settle. ""It means,"" he translated softly, ""walks with coyote.""  
  
As the final syllable of his new name hung in the air, the flap of the sweat-lodge entrance lifted slightly. And there, stepping proudly out of the sagebrush just outside, was Sketch. He walked directly towards John, his lean body moving with a quiet confidence, and sat down beside him, his head held high, his eyes fixed on John with that same intelligent, knowing gaze. He had heard.  
  
Life on The Mesa took on a new dimension for John after the sweat-lodge. The vision, the confirmation from Two Ravens, and his new name, Ma'ii yił bish – walks with coyote – had shifted something deep within him. Two Ravens spent time with John in the days that followed, sharing fragments of ancient knowledge. John learned about the complex nature of Coyote in the Navajo creation stories – a figure of immense power and cunning, capable of both creation and chaos, credited with bringing both knowledge and hardship to the world, causing the great flood, introducing death, and even interfering with the placement of the stars, yet possessing a wisdom that surpassed other beings.  
  
He learned of Grandmother Spider, the weaver of life's intricate web, and Grandfather Spider, her counterpart. He learned of the Raven spirit, a messenger and often a trickster, and understood why Two Ravens carried that name – a connection to that powerful, perceptive energy.  
  
But Two Ravens also spoke of a darker force. He described the ch'į́įdii, a spirit of negativity, roughly translated as demon or Evil One. This entity, he explained, fed on fear, anger, and despair, and it was targeting the people living here on The Mesa, drawn by some unseen imbalance or vulnerability. ""Be careful, Ma'ii yił bish,"" Two Ravens warned, his eyes serious. ""Watch. Sketch will help you see things you normally would not. Trust what he shows you.""  
  
That first night after the sweat-lodge was terrifying. As darkness fell, the familiar landscape transformed. The air seemed to thicken, and in the periphery of his vision, John began to see movement. Not the rustle of animals, but shifting shapes, like ghostly dances of white flames and smoke, swirling and weaving through the sagebrush. These, he understood with a chilling certainty, were the spirits Two Ravens had spoken of, each doing their unseen work in the night. And Sketch... Sketch was no longer the lean, forty-pound dog he'd known. In this spectral light, Sketch appeared as a dire-wolf sized coyote, his form regal and powerful, moving with an ancient, silent grace beside John, a tangible presence in the midst of the unseen.  
  
Despite the unsettling nights, John continued his daily routine. He worked in the community center, organized food, and cooked the evening meals. And Sketch was always there. Now, in the daylight, Sketch didn't vanish. He walked openly beside John, a magnificent coyote whose presence was undeniable. People who saw him for the first time would gasp, startled by the sight of a wild animal acting with such loyalty and companionship towards a human. But as the days passed, the initial shock faded, replaced by a quiet acceptance. The coyote who walked with John became a normal, if still remarkable, part of life on The Mesa.  
  
Then the screaming started. It began a few nights after the visions became clear, always around two in the morning. It wasn't a human scream, not exactly. It was a loud, drawn-out sound, a horrifying cross between a moan and a shriek, carrying on the wind. It sounded like it was speaking, but in a language John couldn't comprehend, a guttural, alien speech that scraped against his nerves. Every time he heard it, his gut would wrench, and his head would spin, a wave of nausea and disorientation washing over him.  
  
He asked others if they heard it, but they shook their heads. ""Just the wind, John,"" they'd say, or ""Maybe a coyote calling."" But John knew it wasn't. The people of The Mesa were troubled. They had learned their lesson about not believing John when it came to Sketch, and now this... this terrifying sound that only he seemed to hear. It scared them. A palpable unease settled over the community. And then, subtly at first, people started to go missing. Not many, just one here, one there. But enough to tighten the knot of fear in everyone's stomach, enough to make the nights feel longer and the shadows deeper. Something dark was indeed feeding on The Mesa.",1,1747331398.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False
1knek8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1knek8w/genuine_question_about_ordering/,Genuine question about ordering...,"Hi, If this is the wrong place to post, I'll happily delete it.There's a new local coffee shop in my area that I've gone to a handful of times. I've had great conversations with one of the owners. I, unfortunately, met the second owner yesterday and our interaction has been eating at me. 

Before I go into what happened, I want to preface that I do not like Starbucks. To me, everything there tastes either watered down or burnt, usually both. I am also aware that they have bastardized the industry. We do have Ziggi's in the area, so I'll go there if I'm not making it at home. But even then, their drinks are often too sweet for me. 

My go-to drink is a flat white, cue the controversy, I know. Or, what I thought was a flat white. I love coffee flavor. The caffeine doesn't matter to me (I'd happily order a decaf version if it came to it). I think the steamed milk adds some creaminess with just a little sweetness, and adds depth to the coffee and enhances the flavor. But I don't want the milk to overpower the richness of the coffee, with minimal foam. 

Back to the interaction. I was quite taken aback by the owner when asked if they do flat whites and he went on this rant that they don't, that he tells his employees not to do them, and that there so many different ones ranging from Australian to Spanish so I really don't know what I want and that it was probably just a latte. 

My question is what do I order so I don't trigger this guy if I come across him again? Personally, I think lattes have too much foam and milk. I want the coffee to be the star, and the milk to be complimentary to it. I've had cortados as well, they're delicious, but they don't quite hit the spot. 

Any and all advice is welcome, I like to learn and if I was in the wrong in this situation, I'll gracefully accept that fact. Thanks in advance!!",1,1747331308.0,barista,9,0.57,False

1knejpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1knejpn/never_been_planning_34_week_trip_between/,Never been: Planning 3-4 week trip between thanksgiving and christmas,"Hi everyone, I'm(28M) in the process of figuring out what my itinerary should look like for an upcoming trip to Costa Rica. I have never been to the country, but have been poking around the idea for years now. I decided to finally just do it, and to do it most likely solo (Though my brother or a close friend \*might\* join, I'm not banking on it. Consider it solo for all intents and purposes.) 

I'm looking at going between thanksgiving and christmas of this year, which it looks like as far as weather is concerned I will have some rain but be just entering the best time of year? Also expecting tourist places to be busy/expensive? I've kind of accepted that as I'm not sure what to expect if I go in the middle of rain season, plus getting out of the crap weather i'll have in my hometown around Nov/Dec will very much be worth any gringo tax I'll have to pay. Not to mention the whole trip will probably cost less money than a months worth of living in the states (Otherwise unmentioned cost of living crisis?)

I'm open to flying into either Liberia or San Jose, but I'm leaning more toward San Jose. I tend to love cities and from what I hear its a very colorful place with lots of REAL LOCALS. I am not looking for some pseudo spiritual hippie beach retreat from this trip. I want to experience the beach towns and do a fair bit of lounging don't get me wrong, but I grew up in a pretty rough area and am not exactly easily startled. I don't want needless trouble though, either.

From the research I've done, all I have so far is a few days (At most?) in the capitol, rent a car so I have transportation and get down to Jaco to experience that \*scene\*, not super into it but hey, when in Rome. And have been recommended by a few to take a ferry across the gulf? 

It sounds silly, but one of my main drivers is views. I love being at elevation looking out to sea. One of my favorite things in life. I also LOVE coffee. So staying at an Airbnb on a farm or something would be awesome. I'd like to do some of the typical stuff, waterfalls, ziplining, etc. Love boats and being at sea, cool nature spots, maybe some cool overlooks?

Hoping this scattered post gets through to someone who might be able to shed anything that might help make my trip better/prevent any disasters. Any assistance in how to plan it out more would be great. I don't want to stay in one spot the whole time (I don't think) but I definitely don't want to feel rushed or bouncing around, either. I will be (lightly) working the whole time I'm there, for what thats worth.

Anyway, I just wanted to get the ball rolling on this and figured this would be the best place to start. Any random tips or thoughts would be highly appreciated.

Has anyone had this? When I wake up and drive to work I am fine, but around the time I start my morning coffee and start working I start feeling dizzy. I want to go out and work out but the dizziness has been crippling me. Usually the dizziness is worse than anxiety.

I am thinking about quitting Buspar and have lowered my dose significantly thinking it’s the culprit but I can’t pinpoint.",1,1747331112.0,BusparOnline,0,1.0,False

1knefot,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1knefot/what_i_actually_spend_living_in_chiang_mai_as_a/,What I Actually Spend Living in Chiang Mai as a Digital Nomad,"Hey everyone,

I've been lurking here for a while, soaking up all the wisdom! Finally ready to share my own budget breakdown after spending 3 months in Chiang Mai. I know those ""cost of living in Thailand for $500 a month!"" articles are tempting, but let’s get real about what I *actually* spent.

Accommodation:

* Airbnb (private room in Nimman area): $650/month Yeah, I know I could’ve gotten something cheaper further out, but I valued the location and AC. Sue me!
* Utilities (electricity, water): $60/month That AC adds up!

Food:

* Eating out (street food + occasional nicer meals): $400/month Delicious and cheap, but I treated myself to Western food more than I thought I would.
* Groceries (mostly snacks and breakfast): $100/month

Transportation:

* Grab/Bolt: $80/month Got a scooter license eventually, but didn’t want to risk it at first.
* Scooter rental (monthly): $120/month

Internet & Phone:

* AIS Fiber (home internet): $30/month
* Local SIM card (unlimited data): $15/month

Coworking & Coffee Shops:

* Coworking space (weekly pass): $100/month Needed a reliable connection for video calls.
* Coffee/snacks at cafes while working: $50/month

Visas & Border Runs:

* 30-day visa extension: $60

Fun & Entertainment:

* Activities (temples, cooking classes, hikes): $100/month
* Drinks & socializing: $150/month

Miscellaneous:

* Laundry: $20/month
* Toiletries & personal care: $50/month

**Total: $2,185/month**

Okay, so definitely not the rock-bottom budget I was initially aiming for! A few things I learned:

* Location, location, location. Nimman is pricier, but worth it for me.
* AC is a killer. Next time, I might try to find a place with better natural ventilation.
* Border runs add up! Planning a longer-term visa strategy for next time. I've been looking at getting a longer-term visa to avoid them. Has anyone had good experiences with agencies in Chiang Mai? A friend mentioned some people use Atlys for visas to make the process a little faster, but I don't know if they offer assistance for Thailand.

Anyone else in Chiang Mai with a similar budget? What are your money-saving tips? Also, any advice on long-term visa options would be amazing!",3,1747331005.0,digitalnomad,3,1.0,False
1kneexz,https://i.redd.it/vcqgpy0lez0f1.png,Anyone else come across these stupid James Andrew ads on YouTube for bad Chinese made bags?,"I checked this out because the guy on the ads is obviously AI generated, and looks like Brian Cox for some reason. Most of the positive reviews on Trustpilot are obviously fake, with users claiming to be from the US but spelling words like ""realize"" as ""realise"", or saying the bags are great when going out to meet with their ""mates"" or using it at ""uni"". Some of the adjectives used are definitely not used by anyone real. The negative reviews all say the bag is nowhere near the quality of what you ordered, is usually vinyl instead of leater, and could have been bought much more cheaply on Temu.

If you check what brands people also looked at, there are a bunch of others also using AI generated old white people in leather aprons as spokespeople. This is goofy as hell but I feel bad for the people who fell for it. The bags advertised actually look pretty nice; it's too bad that's not what you get.

Trustpilot page for anyone who wants to check it out. I tried going to the brands website itself but my virus blocker immediately set off alarms bells (not surprised):

I enjoy Pilates, spin classes, board games, cooking, walks in nature (Cassiobury Park is a fave), and bingeing new Netflix shows.

Before going any further: I've had an echocardiogram and holter monitor done in 2019 that shown no abnormal results. In February of this year, I had a 7d heart monitor that also showed normal results with rare <1% ectopic beats, with no runs of SVT, etc. 

I've been dealing with what I suspected to be PVCs for a few years now, and nearly ALWAYS after eating or when I'm extremely bloated.

Last night, I had PVCs periodically for 4 hours. I'd say probably a couple every hour. I know that burden is still low, but I've never had them like that before. However, yesterday I did have coffee and was particularly more stressed/anxious at work than I think I usually am. Blood pressure and pulse was fine during this time as well.

My question: if I had an echo done 6 years ago, a recent 7d heart monitor test that showed no abnormal findings (I wish it caught more of the episodes, but even still); should I put my mind to rest and just accept this as a fact of my life? It's hard to do, and quite honestly had me a bit scared last night and I wasn't sure whether or not I should be concerned since the frequency of them changed a little bit; but they didn't feel any different than they normally do when they happen sporadically. There was also no pain, but I was a little short of breath BUT I was also extremely bloated and gassy as I have GERD and likely IBS.

I truly feel that my PVCs are brought on by extreme bloating, IBS and my hiatal hernia. I just wish more medical professionals were educated on this and could help treat it without chalking it up to ""just anxiety"".

I make around half of that, and don’t have great benefits, as I work in food service. They’re in tech. None of us have kids. Some even have partners with high incomes, so their dual income is closer to 300k.

I live a very modest lifestyle in order to my income work for me. I don’t order take out. I go out to eat maybe once a week. I never buy coffee out, unless it’s a way for me socialize on the cheap. I vacation once a year; I don’t even really do weekend getaways, except for maybe my or my partners’ birthday, and even then it’s lowkey. I don’t do any beauty treatments like get my nails or lashes done. I buy clothes sparingly and usually as needed -often thrifting or just what’s on sale. I go to museums on free days. I take public transit mostly, with a small budget for ride shares. I have very few entertainment subscriptions. I live in an old apartment with no dishwasher or in unit washer/dryer (which my friends consider “necessities” when they look for places).

All of my friends indulge in a lot of the things I deprive myself of -which I don’t begrudge them for at all of course. It makes sense. If I had more income, I’d spend my money on those kind of things. But, I’m finding it really hard to hold space for them when they complain about how they are stressed financially, when for me going to the doctor twice a month puts significant strain on my budget. 

I feel myself turning away from them emotionally, a little resentful when they lament about their financial situations to me. It feels like they are grossly out of touch and tone deaf. I get it, inflation sucks. But imo, they have more than enough to be able to pay their bills, save, invest, AND indulge in many hedonic pleasures. What it seems like what they’re complaining about is not being able to indulge as much as they like, not that they’re struggling to make ends meet if a sudden necessary expense comes up.

**What I'm Debating**  
Pint X seems like a better fit for my casual/urban use + lighter and more portable  
But… I’ve seen lots of complaints about cramped footpads, etc.  
Curious how it feels for someone my size with my background and use case

**Questions** 

* Is the Pint X significantly lighter and/or more portable than XR? The XR felt heavy and awkward to carry during a demo day.
* Can riding comfort of pint X be meaningfully improved with accessories?
* How does real-world range compare between the two?
* Is the learning curve that much worse on a Pint X?

  
**Use Case**  
Looking for a fun, casual alternative to short car trips. 

* Light grocery runs, coffee shops, quick errands
* Riding greenway/bike path to breweries or friends’ houses a few miles away
* Something to make boring tasks more fun
* Bringing onto public transit
* Bonus: I travel a lot, so portability for exploring new areas is a plus

I’m not looking to trail rip *yet* — more of a “daily putz-around” board for now.

**Background**

* Action sport junkie: MTB, skiing, wakeboarding
* 5'10"", 185 lbs, size 10.5 shoe
* I start small and progress gradually 

**Experience So Far**

* Demoed a stock XR (pre-haptic firmware) for a day. No demos for Pint X in my area.
* Loved the surfy carving feel, 15 miles flew by
* Did experience some nosedives climbing steep hills (no major injuries)
* Wrist guards - necessity 
* Found myself overhanging my lead heel + back foot toe for best control

[KC][MC][HOO][PJO]","So I was just on chatgpt as you do when I got the idea, What if the Winchesters from supernatural somehow met percabeth and got introduced to the riordanverse and likewise for percabeth to the supernatural universe! I got ChatGPT to write a story guided by me, it was a bit long so here's the summary of the story, Some of the characters may be a bit OOC but its k its only head cannon after all:

**Here it is:**

**Title TBD: Multiverse of Myths & Mayhem**  
*Riordanverse × Supernatural Crossover*

**1. Minotaur in Kansas**

Percy and Annabeth are battling the Minotaur in Lebanon, Kansas. Sam and Dean Winchester witness the fight and try to help. Percy is unimpressed by Dean’s bravado. Just as things escalate, **Castiel** appears and kills the Minotaur with his angel blade. After some quick introductions and disbelief, Dean invites the demigods to the Men of Letters bunker. The promise of cheeseburgers helps seal the deal.

**2. Diners, Lore, and First Contact**

On the way Percy and Dean bond over their shared love of the same music and fast food, they even begin to kareoke “carry on my wayward son”, they stop at a diner. Annabeth and Sam geek out over mythologies, Percy and Dean bond over junk food, Castiel broods, and everyone swaps war stories. Sam and Dean learn about Camp Half-Blood, Olympus, and Tartarus. Percy and Annabeth get the rundown on angels, demons, and the Winchester apocalypse resume. Basically percy and annabeth tell the winchesters about the events of their lives so far (which is basically the summary of the first 5 Percy jackson books and the 5 heroes of olympus books) and Sam and Dean tell percy and annabeth about their lives so far (basically the events of Supernatural seasons 1 to 12) but the only change in the story is that Cass wasn’t affected by the fall of the angels and so still has the powers he had in the middle of Season 6 but the mentality and humility of Season 12 Cass.

**3. Enter Magnus & Alex then the Bunker happens**

At the diner, **Magnus Chase and Alex Fierro** arrive coincidentally. Magnus recognizes Annabeth (his cousin), and soon he and Alex are pulled into the chaos. They share their stories — Valhalla, the Ship of the Dead, Loki — and are invited to the bunker. Dean is especially kind to Alex, which surprises her. Everyone piles into Baby and drives back to the Bunker where they exchange pleasantries, suddenly the demigods all stand up and get tense claiming there is something unnatural nearby and prepare for a skirmish when Jack Kline walks in from Sam’s room and asks everyone if they want cereal. Dean and Sam then have to explain that Jack Kline is the son of Lucifer and a Nephilm but is innately good, pure even, they all calm down and Dean goes all dad mode and tells everyone to get to bed.

**3.5. Quiet Hours – Midnight in the Bunker {Maybe a little OOC but again Head-cannon}**

🌙 The bunker falls into quiet, and deeper threads emerge.

* **Alex & Magnus**: Alex wakes from a trauma nightmare. She’s shaking, panicked, and trying not to cry. Magnus holds her, comforts her, and tells her the abuser (her father) can’t reach her here. She softens, calls him hers. He replies: “Always.” She falls asleep in his arms as they cuddle)
* **Percy & Annabeth**: Percy has a Tartarus nightmare about nearly killing Akhlys and *liking it*. He’s terrified of the darkness still in him. Annabeth reassures him gently, telling him that survival isn’t sin, and they’ll face the dark parts together. He says he doesn’t deserve her. She says, “Tough. You’ve got me anyway.”
* **Crowley** talks to **Castiel as he** stands guard at Jack’s door. The cosmos may be broken, but here, there is safety.

**4. 3:47 AM – Hearth & Blitz Rune-Crash the Bunker**

💥 BOOM — A portal explodes open. Wards go wild. Alarms blare. **Hearthstone and Blitzen** stumble through, panicked. Hearth is instantly defensive, runes in hand. Blitz hides behind him, gasping.

Within seconds, Sam, Dean, Castiel, and Crowley confront them with weapons drawn.

Tension explodes. Hearth signs warnings, radiating magic. Sam and Dean are seconds from firing. Crowley calls them “glorified cosplay extras.” Cass identifies their auras as Norse — “twisted by dimensional trauma.”

Just before everything implodes, **Magnus**, **Alex**, **Annabeth**, and **Percy** appear sleepily.

Magnus: “Hearth?! Blitz?!”  
Alex: “Is the apocalypse starting early?”  
Annabeth: “If this isn't a monster, I’m going back to bed.”  
Percy: “Are we getting attacked or what?”

Magnus hugs Hearth. Alex glares at everyone. Hearth and Blitz explain: **something is affecting the runes and magic**. They tried to teleport to magnus but were thrown off by the bunker’s magical wards. Dean grumbles about people punching holes in space-time. Cass confirms they’re telling the truth. 

Dean assembles a war council at the big table in the bunker where they let Hearth and Blitz explain themselves. veryone except the angel and Demon are sleepy and grumpy but allow Hearth and Blitz to tell their story. Hearth and Blitz noticed runes turning into greek and then into hieroglyphs and then into some random signs, Hearth summons The rune again and Cass says that those last random signs are enochian for Danger or intruder, percy and annabeth also confirm that the greek letters also mean something along those lines. Jack Kline then comes in and tells The group that he feels something is outside the empty and their known universe and it's attempt to enter caused the multiverse to sort of squish together as a defense mechanism of sorts, but he doesn't know for sure he's just guessing from how it feels,

Dean tells everyone to go to bed and that they would sort out this mess later. The adults have a meeting regarding the safety of the kids and the kids (demigods) meet together at night to talk as friends. Cass comes in hearing the convo, and he tells them very characteristically about the benefits of sleep and tells them to go to bed much softer, they listen to him and go to their rooms. Alex though pulls Magnus aside and tells him that she can't sleep because every-time she tries she see's her abusive father's face. She looks very uncharacteristically on the verge of tears, Magnus promises to cuddle with her as they sleep, Cass overhears and walks over and quietly informs the 2 that he over heard them (and is very sorry about that), he then offers to make Alex sleep using his powers and that she won't dream as much in that state, Alex a little ashamed agrees and Cass does it, Magnus still carries her over to the bed and cuddles with her anyway, a little healing magic seeping into her but magnus doesn't even realize he's doing that, Alex sleeps with a teary comfortable smile

**4.5. The Morning after {Again maybe a bit OOC but also again HEAD-CANNON!}**

Percy and Annabeth wake up first in the morning and walk over to Magnus and Alex's room Inside, Magnus and Alex are completely tangled in each other — Alex’s head tucked under Magnus’s chin, his arms wrapped tightly around her, her hand fisted gently in the front of his shirt. They look impossibly peaceful., Percy and Annabeth look at each other and grin and slowly sneak back out of the room, They meet up with Sam and Dean who also wake up around that time, Dean is extremely grumpy and gruff and Sam remarks to Percy and Annabeth that he's always like that before he gets his morning coffee in, Dean just grumbles as a response

\[Extended excerpt of the actual story bcoz its amazing\]:

Then magnus and alex wake up, Magnus stirs first. There’s a sleepy sort of peace in the air—the bunker feels quiet, insulated from the chaos of gods, monsters, demons, and breakfast disasters.

His eyes blink open slowly. It takes him a moment to realize where he is… and then who he’s wrapped around. Alex.

Their legs are tangled. One of her arms is flung over his chest. His own hand is nestled in her hair, warm against the back of her neck. She’s pressed so close to him he can feel the rise and fall of her breath.

He freezes.

Magnus (internal monologue):

Okay. Okay, cool. Normal. Very normal to wake up like this. Definitely not panicking. She’s adorable. But she might also kill me.

He glances down at her face.

Her hair is a mess of green and black strands across his shoulder. Her expression is calm. Peaceful, even. A soft little smile is present that makes his heart ache and melt all at once.

And now he’s panicking a little more.

Magnus (thinking):

She’s going to wake up and see me practically enveloping her and just. Garrote me with her scarf. Or turn into a tiger. Or—

She shifts.

His heart stops.

Then… she opens her eyes.

Still sleepy. Still blinking at the light. Then her gaze lands on him—his clearly nervous face hovering barely inches from hers, his hand still in her hair.

She smiles.

Genuinely. Softly. No sarcasm, no edge.

She leans in just slightly and pulls him even closer, tucking her head beneath his chin.

Alex (murmuring):

“You panic too much, Chase.”

Magnus exhales all the tension he didn’t realize he’d been holding.

Magnus (softly):

“You sure? You’re not gonna… transform into a wolverine and disembowel me or something?”

Alex (sleepy-smiling):

“Not this morning.”

He chuckles, kisses the top of her head instinctively. She hums at the gesture and tightens her grip on him.

They lie there in silence a while longer, agreeing to stay like that for just 5 more minutes

The peaceful five more minutes have stretched into ten. Maybe fifteen. Magnus and Alex are still curled up, murmuring softly about nothing in particular when—

**BAM.** The door slams open.

**Dean Winchester**, grumpy, unshaven, holding a *loaded shotgun*, storms in like a man on a mission.

**Dean** (loudly, gruff):  
“Alright, cuddlebugs—get your clothes on before I start blasting!”

Magnus bolts upright like he’s been struck by lightning, hair a mess, blanket falling off his shoulders. His face goes *bright red.*

**Magnus** (panicked):  
“W–We are wearing clothes!!”

Alex doesn’t even flinch. She just props herself up on one elbow, blinking slowly at Dean with a look of unimpressed disdain.

**Alex** (dryly, arms crossed):  
“You wanna try that again without the Puritan shotgun dad energy, Winchester?”

Dean blinks.

Alex keeps going, **tone increasingly colorful**:

**Alex**:  
“We’re wearing clothes, we were asleep, and frankly, if you ever barge in on us like that again, I will personally, with the blessings of everything that is holy AND unholy, take and shove that shotgun so far up your—”

**Dean** (quickly, holding up a hand):  
“*Okay.* Okay. Message received.”

**Percy and Annabeth** appear behind him in the doorway, looking very apologetic.

**Annabeth**:  
“We tried to stop him.”

**Percy**:  
“He said something about ‘cuddling kids’ and wouldn’t listen.”

**Magnus** (still clutching the blankets, face tomato red):  
“I’m gonna melt into the floor and die now.”

Dean huffs, looking between Alex’s glare and Magnus’s humiliation. And … softens. A little.

**Dean** (gruff but lower):  
“Look, I was just making sure. You’re both… you know. Kids. I mean. *Kind of*. Whatever. Just get off each other and come to the damn kitchen. Coffee’s ready.”

He turns around and marches off with the shotgun slung over his shoulder like nothing happened.

They all head to breakfast, after which Cass and Jack offer to travel to the edge of the universe to get a closer look at whatever is trying to enter, Alex and Magnus offer to go to Valhalla and ask Odin for more advice, Percy and Annabeth invite the winchesters over to camp Halfblood to talk to Chiron and get his 2 cents and Crowley says's he's gonna consult his infernal library and Rowena for more info Hearth and Blitz decide to stay behind and read the bunker's library for some info and Hearth offers to improve the Bunker's warding and protection

 

**5. Capture the Flag at Camp Half-Blood**

Percy and Annabeth and the winchesters in baby travel to Camp Half-Blood. There is a bit of an initial skirmish with the patrolling Ares house, the Cabin Head even punctures one of Baby's tires, Dean does NOT take kindly to this, steps out and is about to confront the kid when percy and annabeth calm him down and take him inside to the big house Once introduced to Chiron the winchesters are invited to play in a Capture the Flag match. Annabeth immediately calls dibs on the winchesters and percy who both accept. It's Athena, Apollo, Hades, Poseidon, houses and The winchesters as the blue team vs Ares, Hephaestus, Hermes, Aphrodite, Dionysus and Demeter houses as the red team. Even though the red team vastly outnumbers the Blue team in terms of people Annabeth is still very confident about their chances.

They discuss their plan later on, Dean suggests a more direct approach with the winchesters and Athena house charging through the middle with Apollo providing support with healing and arrows while Nico and percy flank from opposite sides as very significant distractions Annabeth agrees and adds that percy and Nico should try to attract as much attention as possible to themselves and that specifically Percy should probably form a wall of water and ice and that Nico should probably summon a few undead soldiers to cause mayhem, Nico grins darkly and say he can do that. percy smiles and agrees he can do his part too. Sam clarifies whether he can use spells and other traps to trip up the invading ares team and suggests he could use a mini magical EMP to disable any machines Hephaestus house makes, the Apollo captain Will Solace agrees tells them he'll be near the home flag with some archers to protect the flag and provide any healing for their side.

the games begin The Winchesters are scary, Dean especially, he is absolutely mowing through the Ares Cabin who step back in surprise, not expecting him to be such a monster in the battle field, while he isn't using lethal force he is certainly incapacitating anyone who comes in his way, Sam is more cold, more tactical, he is behind his brother dealing with anyone who gets behind his brother. In that sense sam is more like a silent assassin dropping in from the shadows when the red team least expects him. he sets of the EMP and leaves all of the Hephaestus house very confused and scrambling back to their flag to figure out what's going on. Nico and Percy are equally terrifying summoning massive hordes of skeletons and water respectively to distract and split the reds to deal with them. annabeth and Athena house charge forward behind the winchesters with Apollo house raining arrows on the reds and healing any of The injured blues. But the reds have the numbers advantage and the fight is slow and tough

A small group of The Ares cabin including the kid who punctured baby's tire earlier and a large ares boy who is the head of the ares house, breaks through the thin blue line and rushes to the blue flag annabeth shouts to dean to run back and protect the flag and he does so immediately, he gets there just in time as the ares group have badly beaten up the defending Apollo children, dean enraged yells at them and decides to show them the same mercy they just showed Apollo house, the ares captain snorts, confident but wary and shouts to dean ""There are 7 of us with spears you have only yourself"" Dean responds ""ehh I've fought god's sister and killed an entire nest of Vamps, I like my chances"" he then launches into battle taking on all 7 at once defeating them procedurally finally fighting the captain.

he decides to truly embarrass the ares captain, just as Sam and Annabeth and percy walk through to support dean they find him surrounded by 6 very bloody ares kids and dean in the middle  like a maniac pinning the ares captain on the ground with his foot grabbing his arm back and nearly breaking it all the while telling him to never touch baby again and also to never be so brutal to his own friends and family or else dean will know, the ares captain is now fully crying and pleading with him, percabeth look at each other stunned and trying not to laugh at the scene in front of them sam however knows better and knows when dean isn't thinking straight and calls out telling Dean to let him go and that they'd deal with the ares captain later

Nico is scaring the living daylights out of everyone, when Dean steps back in, still a menace but not as violent as he was before, the ares team however has heard of him by now and most of them step away from him daring not to test him some do and find out quickly why that's not a good idea, they reach the flag and now its sam's turn to show why he's a Winchester, Sam goes in like a shadow quickly and silently taking out everyone while dean just stands back watching, proud. Sam captures the flag and wins not before helping the kids he took out find some help

**6. Dinner and the Warning Rune**

At the post-game feast, Chiron asks Sam and Dean to speak. Dean tosses a rune Hearth gave him into the air. It shifts: Purple Greek → Green Norse → Red Egyptian → Light Blue Enochian  Each symbol means “INTRUDER.”

Chiron pales. He tells them they must consult both Hotel Valhalla and Brooklyn House. There’s something older at work.

**7. Odin Arrives**

Before they can leave, **Odin** appears with an illusion projector (or conjured slideshow — your choice). He confirms their fears.

The entity is something known only as the **Watcher** it's a cosmic entity bound by ancient law: it cannot interfere — only observe. But when it approaches, it means reality itself is in danger. Odin says this has only happened once before, and barely ended without catastrophe.

**8. Brooklyn House Briefing**

The crew travels to Brooklyn House. They’re met by **Carter and Sadie Kane**, and eventually **Walt Stone**. Sadie is annoyed that her hieroglyphs have started glitching into “pretzel magic.” Crowley arrives with Hearth and Blitz and Crowley is immediately caged by magical hieroglyphs. Sadie shuts him up with bread. Sam explains (awkwardly) that he’s with them then Walt frees Crowley.

Carter and Sadie tell their story: the gods they’ve hosted, the chaos they’ve battled, and the threads they’ve felt pulling at the Duat — Egyptian magic space — itself.

**9. Crowley’s Intel**

Crowley says **Rowena** has detected echoes of some type of rot in **other hells**. 

**10. Return to the Bunker – Bunkmate Mayhem**

Everyone returns to the bunker. Dean turns the war table into a Dining table and starts grilling. Jack joins. Alex claims a couch with Magnus. Sam tries to assign sleeping quarters and fails.

Someone (probably Sadie) puts a “Do Not Summon Demons Before Coffee” sign on the fridge.

**11. Kane Chronicles Recap**

Dean asks Carter and Sadie about their past. They recount their adventures: from losing their dad, to battling Set and Apophis, to nearly being burnt out by the gods they hosted. The demigods and hunters are impressed. Sam is particularly intrigued by the god-host dynamics.

**12. Jack & Castiel Return – Burned by the Watcher**

Jack Kline and Cass suddenly teleport in Singed, and Burnt, Jack is frowning slightly and Cass is in full protector mode until he sees he's in The bunker, he then goes to the table and tells them that they all have a problem, they met with the watcher, with the edge of the universe between them but the watcher did not talk or speak in the traditional sense, he instead gave them visions and showed them images of something black and vile bubbling at the edges of the universe, almost like a universal cancer or rot and it was spreading, fast. Cass shudders, which worries Sam and Dean because if something can terrify Cass then they truly have something to worry about, Jack Kline steps in and continues, saying that once they were done he tried to help The watcher out by trying to let him into the universe but the watcher instead pushed him out and shook his head no and left to go elsewhere, he continued by saying Cass tried to teleport them to the bunker but they were thrown of to some fiery land with some demon like creature named Surt trying to kill them. Hearth looks up apologetic and signs an apology and signs that he may need to rework the sigils to not make them go to muspelheim again. Cass continues and says that Jack managed to get them here anyway but that he does not know how. Jack just responds innocently something like ""oh I just unknit the warding""

**13. The Plan moving forward**

Dean clapped his hands again.

“We need recon, first. Cas? You and Sam start working on tracking any disturbances or possession flares. Use the angel radio, demon omens, whatever you can get.”

Sam nodded, already pulling out a laptop. “On it.”

“Jack, you’re with me. You’re gonna help reinforce the bunker’s wards. I don’t want another surprise teleport from Fire World.”

Jack chuckled. “Yes, sir.”

“Percy, Annabeth, Nico—you three coordinate with Carter, Sadie, and Walt. Look into the ancient stuff. Cross-pantheon threats. If anyone has buried prophecies or warnings, it’s gonna be in the myths.”

Magnus and Alex agree to seek the **Norns** for prophecy. They prep to head back toward Valhalla, Blitz and Hearth join them claiming that they may need something ancient to focus to runes to work. Sam suggests a piece of the bones of the first Jotun Ymir. Hearth and Blitz prepare to go with Alex and Magnus to Valhalla to meet with the rest of the floor 19 gang and Odin and then prepare to head to Jotunheim from Valhalla.

1kndtrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1kndtrt/family_law_advise_fathers_rights/,Family Law Advise - Fathers Rights?,"Hi,

Never really posted anything like this online before and nobody I know has really been through anything like this so I wanted to just see if I could get some advice from the masses whilst I also get advice from family solicitors etc.

I received a call today from a social worker saying they have already done a home visit and spoken to my daughter (lets call her L) about her environment at home, this is all following a noise complaint from my ex-wife's (J) neighbour about her boyfriend (B) who has lived there full time for about 4/5 years screaming at 'the children' (they have a son together too).

For context, J and I's break up was ugly but eventually developed into a real effort to co-parent from both sides which I was really happy with and working really hard towards, a few years back I received messages from one of J's friends with screenshots of complaints about her boyfriend, use of drugs (never confirmed whether it was in the children's presence or not) and evidence of behaviour that was concerning at the least.

I went to J and we came to an agreement that L would stay with me until we could have a serious conversation about this and it came to light that B had some underlying mental health problems that he was medicated AND self medicating for (weed) and that it was all under control and they remained under a close eye from me for about a year following that, social services were never involved, although they were a very real threat.

Snap to today, I'm remembering that L is coming to me (she stays with me every other weekend) slightly dirty every now and, nails left uncut for a decent amount of time etc. Since she has told the social worker that she has to look after her little brother, she has to make J and B coffee using a coffee machine, she has to remind mummy that she needs to brush her teeth and she also needs to wake mummy up to take her to school.

She is also at a school attendance of 74% and when I was raised with the attitude that I literally have to be bleeding out or hospitalised to miss a day of school that horrifies me too haha.

My daughter is 7 years old and I currently feel nothing but sick and horrified having potentially overlooked something obvious. I have a home for her, there is no space or financial issues if she were to come and live with me full time and I am aware that because I am on the birth certificate and we were married that there will be no dispute about my parental responsibility, I am also aware that I can remove L from any situation that I deem unsafe for her best interests.

FTR, I'm not doing this to dispute who's bad or who's good in this scenario, I don't doubt J's love for our daughter in the slightest however with her diagnoses BPD and his diagnosed schizophrenia and this social workers call, my concerns are turning into flat our fears.

I've been invited to a meeting with the social worker, B, J and B's mental health practitioner next week, and I'm picking up L on Saturday morning as its my weekend to have with her (Saturday to Monday school run).

I'm seeking advice from a family solicitor and I'm calling citizens advice tomorrow too, but I figure there would be something I could get out of posting this, whether it be advise, comfort or pointing in the right direction.

1knds2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1knds2m/can_the_amazon_basics_f625c_electric_kettles/,Can the Amazon Basics F-625C Electric Kettle's features live up? Review inside!,"Testing and reviewing products is something I always take seriously, balancing the good and bad to provide honest feedback. The **Amazon Basics F-625C Electric Kettle** has been part of my daily kitchen routine for a while now, boiling water for my morning coffee, afternoon tea, or even quick instant noodles. Here’s my deep dive into this electric kettle and how it has performed for me.

**Modern Design and Build Quality**

The design of this electric kettle is something that immediately stands out. Its blend of black and silver colors, encased in glass and steel, gives it a contemporary and premium look that seamlessly fits into modern kitchen aesthetics. Watching the water bubble through its transparent carafe, enhanced with blue LED illumination, feels oddly satisfying every single time. I’m also impressed with the finish; even after continuous daily use, it still manages to look brand new, resisting fingerprints and watermarks.

One thing I can’t ignore is its size and weight. At 8.74 x 6.22 x 9.41 inches, and weighing 2.49 pounds, it feels well-proportioned and portable. However, during use, the large glass surface does get quite warm, which is something to be cautious about, especially if you have kids wandering around.

**Rapid Boiling Convenience**

This kettle is a powerhouse in the boiling department. With its 1500W heating element, it turns cold water into a rolling boil in just a matter of minutes. Having tested it several times, I found that filling it to its maximum capacity of 1.7 liters doesn’t compromise its speed, making it ideal for busy mornings when time is of the essence. More impressive is how quiet it is compared to some older models I’ve used; the boiling process doesn’t turn into a loud, disruptive affair. 

If you're someone like me who juggles multiple tasks, the automatic shut-off feature and boil-dry protection are lifesavers. Forgetful moments, like leaving the kettle running without enough water, won’t lead to disaster, thanks to these safety mechanisms.

**[Check Amazon Basics F-625C price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b07jzq1mxt/)**

**Performance and Usability**

Using this kettle daily has been a breeze. It’s equipped with practical features like a wide opening for filling and easy cleaning. I particularly love the water level indicator, making precise measurements simple. Some kettles I’ve had tested my patience while having to tilt and guess the remaining water level. This one solves that issue effortlessly.

Something I must highlight is the stay-cool handle. Even when the kettle itself heats up, the handle remains cool to the touch, ensuring a burn-free experience. But here’s the kicker – the detachable base. It offers 360-degree cordless convenience, making pouring and refilling feel fluid. Whether you're left-handed or right-handed, it won’t discriminate.

**Safety and Food Grade Materials**

What impressed me the most about this product is its commitment to safety and health. The kettle uses BPA-free materials in all water contact areas, a detail that reassures me about the quality of my beverages. There’s also the high-quality Strix thermostat control. Known for reliability and precision, this technology adds another layer of trust to this device. Knowing that it won’t overheat gives me confidence every time I use it.

**Good Points**

- Sleek modern design with blue LED illumination.
- Fast 1500W boiling power saves significant time.
- Safety features like automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection.
- BPA-free, food-grade materials for healthier drinks.
- Convenient cordless base and wide opening for easy use.

**Negative Attributes**

- Outer glass surface becomes hot to the touch during use.
- No adjustable temperature setting for more delicate drinks.
- A bit bulky for smaller kitchen counters.

**Market Rivals**

When comparing this product to others in its price bracket, like the Hamilton Beach 1.7L Electric Kettle or the Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp, the Amazon Basics model holds its own in terms of performance and affordability. For example, the Cuisinart offers variable temperature settings, which can appeal to tea enthusiasts needing precision. However, it costs significantly more and isn’t as compact as the Amazon Basics version.

On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach kettle matches some of the core features but feels a bit bulkier and lacks the sophisticated LED illumination that adds charm to the Amazon Basics kettle. Overall, the Amazon Basics F-625C excels in balancing simplicity, performance, and an affordable price point.

**Worth Every Penny**

Compared to its competitors, this kettle delivers premium features without stretching your budget unnecessarily. The powerful heating, safety features, and premium design offer fantastic value for its price. While perfection might call for additional features like variable temperatures or insulation to keep the exterior cool, you’re getting a deal most kitchen appliances can’t match at this level. This product is a true testament to smart spending.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

On Saturday night, my husband and I got into a argument.

I was making dinner for us. One kids was asleep; the other was watching TV (edit: she fell asleep and I moved her to her bedroom so she was not around for the argument). It was a nice dinner and one of his favorites. Before I started cooking, I pulled the clothes out of the dryer and dumped them on the coffee table so I could move the next load in to the dryer (relevant later).

Dinner took about 30–40 minutes to make (and I had to run to the grocery store twice). He sat down to eat with me and ate it without saying thank you. We didn’t really talk during dinner; he only answered questions I asked but was mostly watching something/scrolling on his phone.

After dinner, I started cleaning the kitchen while he stayed at the table on his phone, drinking wine. He eventually moved his glass and bottle to the couch, walking right by the laundry, and sat down to watch. He left his dirty dishes on the table (I'd cleared everything else). After cleaning the kitchen, I sat down in front of him and started folding laundry. He didn’t say anything.

When I was done, I sat down and asked to talk. I explained all of the above and said that I feel like the cook and housekeeper of the house. He thanked me for telling him but said I should’ve said something earlier instead of coming to him in tears.

I started to say, “I don’t feel like I should—” and he cut me off and asked me twice if I thought communication was important. I said I agreed, but also that I don’t feel like I should have to ask him to say thank you for a home-cooked meal or to help clean the kitchen or fold laundry. These are things that need to get done, and he also lives here. It's also just courteous. I also added that he left his dirty plate on the table and it was like I was expected to clean up that too because it needed to be cleared so the table could be wiped down.

He argued that I need to tell him these things. I said, “We both live here. We should both contribute 50%. I shouldn’t have to go around telling you to do things.” He rolled his eyes at the “50%” and said, “There’s a lot that I could say right now, and I’m just going to get angry because I’ve been drinking, so you’re right. Whatever.”

As soon as he acknowledged he’d been drinking, I realized this was a losing battle because he had either drank more or faster than I thought. I started to leave the room, and he followed me and asked, “Do you want me to wipe down the table?”

At that point, I was frustrated and defeated, so I sighed and said, “Do whatever you want.” He responded by loudly throwing his plate and silverware into the sink.

I told him that when he gets angry like that, it’s scary to me. He said, “You told me to do whatever I want—and that’s what I want to do.”

I repeated that it was still scary to me, and he said sarcastically, “Oh yeah, because I’m so violent all the time.”

I said, “You are bigger and stronger than me. I’m sure that’s what a lot of people think before something bad happens.”

He responded again in the same tone: “Yeah, that’s me. Just the drunk, violent deadbeat. That’s what you’re aiming for.” I have never said that. And although very infrequent, this is not the first done he has done something like that (thrown something against the wall, broke an umbrella, slammed a door, one time (years ago) he punched/hit the wall near the side of my head). I just left the room and cried myself to sleep.

The next morning was Mother’s Day. I woke up early with the kids. He came out not too late, poured himself coffee, and sat on the patio. He didn’t say anything to me. We didn’t talk until I started asking him random questions because we were supposed to see family, and I didn’t want them to pick up on the tension.

It feels like a losing battle. I either have to follow him around and ask him to do everything in the house or I do and it never works (or I just do it myself).

When I do ask, it often doesn’t help. For example, if I ask him to clean the kitchen, he’ll do it but leave a pot and ladle on the stove and won’t wipe down the counters. I once asked him to peel a Cutie tangerine for our kid, and he said he didn’t know how. If I ask him to put away his dishes, he’ll say, “Do you know how often I clean up after you?”

So... AITA here?

I’m really trying to be self-aware and understand if I’m in the wrong. I feel like my hill to die on is that I shouldn’t have to tell him to do every little thing but idk if I'm being too stubborn.",3,1747329272.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False
1kndonh,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1kndonh/explore_cuisinart_cpt720_toaster_review_is_this/,Explore Cuisinart CPT-720 Toaster Review Is This the Ideal Breakfast Upgrade?,"Testing the toaster from the perspective of an everyday user, you begin to notice all the quirks — both charming and frustrating — that accompany any kitchen gadget. Having spent time with the Cuisinart CPT-720 2-Slice Digital Toaster with MemorySet Feature, it starts feeling like more than a mere appliance; it’s practically a breakfast partner. Delivering well-toasted bread with remarkable consistency, this product has seen its fair share of crusts, bagels, and even the occasional frozen waffle in my kitchen.

**A Clean, Modern Design That Fits In**  
The brushed stainless steel finish caught my attention immediately. It looks sleek and blends effortlessly with other kitchen appliances, especially if you're into that minimalist aesthetic. It's compact too, measuring only about 6.86""D x 11.34""W x 7.19""H, which means even in a kitchen with limited counter space, this toaster won’t hog all the room. Plus, it’s lightweight at just 1 pound, so relocating it isn’t a chore.  

Another subtle but practical design feature is the large digital display. I’ve had toasters where picking the right setting felt like an uncalculated gamble, but the screen eliminates guesswork entirely. You see everything at a glance — from toast shade to your chosen bread type — which simplifies the experience for someone as easily distracted as I am in the mornings.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Easy-to-clean stainless steel exterior that wipes down in seconds.  
- Large digital screen offering clear visibility for all settings.  
- Compact and lightweight design perfectly suited for smaller kitchens.  

**Not Just a Toaster, But a Menu on Demand**  
Exploring all the features this toaster offers makes me feel like I’ve traded up from a basic model to something with culinary ambitions. It’s not limited to just a generic bread-toast cycle. With seven bread-type options like white, grain, bagel, sweet, waffles, English muffin, and gluten-free, every piece of bread is treated like it deserves a VIP experience. Using the bagel setting was an eye-opener; it toasted the cut side beautifully while keeping the outer layer chewy — all those years of uneven bagels feel like lost time now.  

The MemorySet feature is great for lazy mornings (I fully embrace those). You simply save your favorite combinations — shade level, bread type, and all — which makes repetitive toasting mindlessly simple. For someone in my family who basically eats the same toast every day, this is a gift.

**A Toasting Performance That Shines**  
Speaking of toast shades, this machine offers a selector ranging from light (1) to dark (7). I tested them all just for kicks. The lowest level barely warmed the bread, whereas the darkest gave that coffee-shop char without tasting burnt. Additionally, defrost and single-slice settings make it feel like this thing thought of everything. Ever toasted one slice in a machine meant for two, only for one to burn because the heat wasn’t evenly distributed? That’s entirely avoided here.  

One thing I noticed: it works quietly. If you’ve ever owned an old, clunky toaster that clunks like a freight train when done, you’ll appreciate the smooth operation here. It doesn’t make abrupt noises to startle you when you’re pre-caffeine, and trust me, that’s a kitchen win.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Toast ejects a bit forcefully; lighter slices may fly off the rack.  
- The housing can heat up slightly during prolonged use.  
- Bread larger than standard-slice width might require creative placement.  

**Challengers**  
The toaster isn’t without its rivals. For instance, Breville’s toasters with similar digital interfaces offer more premium build quality but come at almost double the cost. On the other hand, your classic Black+Decker models provide greater affordability but sacrifice features like a countdown timer and memory presets that this machine does so well. Comparing it to models like Russell Hobbs, I’d argue Cuisinart edges ahead with its tailored bread-type settings, although other brands may win in aesthetics with more color options.

What you’re left with here strikes that balance between affordability and decent functionality. The Breville feels like a splurge, while the Black+Decker often leads to compromising on specialized features.

**Smart Spending**  
Is the price justified? Considering its functionality, you’re investing in consistency and ease of use. Premium features like MemorySet eliminate everyday nuisances, while the bread-type diversification elevates its standing beyond budget competitors. If you're redesigning your kitchen on a moderate budget, this is excellent value for its performance. Don't expect the bells and whistles of higher-end competitors, but for its price tier, it truly over-delivers.

There's great information here whether you are a practicing Magician or a secular Tarotist.

So get cozy, grab a cup of tea, and settle down for some Tarot insights!

**1. There are many magical, astrological, and tarot courses available online, ranging in price from a few hundred to thousands of dollars. Why did you decide to offer** [Quareia](https://www.quareia.com/)**, which is a complete magical education, for free?**

The magical path to me is a life path which besides magic, can have mystical, and practical dynamics of self evolution. I do not see it as a commodity or business, and to charge for it would lock a lot of people out from learning. I am a teacher, not a business woman, and I teach because I love the subject matter. With the course being on line, people from all over the world can choose to engage with the training, but what could be the cost of a fancy latte in Seattle can be nearly a week’s wage in some countries. The only way to make it fair, to keep it honest and keep it accessible for all is to make it free.

A lot of magical training that is done for profit can quickly become compromised – it is tempting for a teacher to keep on an unsuitable student simply because they pay well, or to adapt the teaching to make it more palatable to a consumer. So much magical training these days rides on the back of current trends, fashions, etc, and it is very easy to dumb down the training or throw in ‘glitter’, or simply make shit up just to draw the customers in. While I understand that teachers need to support themselves financially, and I cast no moral or ethical judgement on that, what this ultimately does is debase the training and leads students down dead-end paths. It is simply just one of those things that happens no matter how good the intent is.

Magic is too precious to me to destroy it in such a way – it is my life path. Putting it up for free as a self study practical course ensures those who should find it and work it, will do so. It makes no difference to me if ten people or a thousand people engage with the course – it is there as a service to magic, not as a source of income.

I made donation buttons available if people want to donate, and all the money is used to continue the work, provide resources to students and organise events. Quareia has a board of trustees who oversee what happens to the donations and who keep me in check, and we have a student council where students look out for each other, and they feed back to me the sort of projects/events they want the money used for.

I have quite a few published books that generate a modest income, and my partner sells his original artwork, and we also have a [redbubble page](https://www.redbubble.com/people/qpublishing/shop?ref=artist_title_name) of his designs. He also gets a cut from the sale of the Quareia [magicians deck](https://www.quareia.com/the-deck). So we get by.

**2. Did practicing Magic lead you to Tarot, or did Tarot lead you to Magic? How did you become acquainted with Tarot cards?**

I started with tarot in my early teens. My eldest sister was a good reader and I was surrounded by people who used tarot in various ways. I got some birthday money and took myself off to town to buy something. I came across a single tarot deck in a department store (of all places). It was there on its own, pushed in with a load of books (non magical) and it sort of shouted at me to rescue it. It was a small Serravalle-Sesia Italian tarot deck, so I took it home. I played around with it for a long time, made friends with it, talked to it etc. I started using it for divination a couple of years later and worked with basic layouts. In terms of passage into magic, the tarot didn’t really put me into magic, I sort of slide sideways in increments into the world of magic through my childhood and teen years. My father was into Rosicrucianism and had a variety of interesting books he would drop in front of me, and my mother was what I would today call a ‘natural magician’ who talked to everything.

**3. In the Quareia course,** [Apprentice Module 1 Lesson 2](https://www.quareia.com/apprentice-module-1)**, you write that it is important for a Magician to practice Tarot. Would a Magician without Tarot knowledge be at a disadvantage?**

I think so… some form of divination is a corner stone of magical practice. Tarot in itself is not very accurate for magical readings, and I found that very early on in my magical life. So I started to make my own decks, designing layouts etc and learned to not be restricted by the tarot format. I designed decks for specific parts of magical work (healing, exorcism, temple construction etc) by throwing out the rule books and looking at what did I actually need as a vocabulary to gain the insights I needed. And that is essentially was tarot or any card divination is, simply a vocabulary.

A magician uses card divination in a way that is probably quite different to many modern tarot readers – it is used to look back in time, forward in time to spot patterns of fate behaviour, it is used to gain insight into the present unseen, to talk to ancestors, deities etc, and to commune with what is popularly called ‘the higher self’. It is used to check the unfolding of proposed magical work to spot unseen consequences, it is used to find things, quantify things, and to learn.

**4. The Quareia course could take up to 17 years for a student to complete and reach Adepthood. Do you think decades from now, after more students have gone through the course, we'll see a ""Quareia-style"" system of Magic unfolding, similar to how we saw Golden Dawn-style systems in the 20th Century?**

I hope not! The Golden Dawn system was of its time (late 19th century) and like all systems, it had its limitations. The continuing of that system into present day is to carry an ossified dinosaur around which essentially limits the evolution of the magician (I know, that will piss off a lot of people). I am hoping that the Quareia style training will produce magicians who are informed and who think carefully, who evolve their adept path in a unique way to them and who leave breadcrumbs of learning behind them for others to find and develop in ways we cannot yet even think about. There is no lodge of Quareia, no hierarchical group and grades, there is the individual magician. First the student learns foundations and training rules so that they can learn the rules before as an adept they them break them in gnosis.

Magic needs to be constantly evolving, and it needs to evolve as a practice and path in a way that is conducive to the time and culture of the magician – so essentially Quareia should become a ‘dinosaur’ at some point. If that happens then I have done my job – the future generations should always outgrow the previous ones.

**5. How has teaching Magic changed your own Magical practice?**

I have been teaching since 1993. Before that, my own practice was pretty much all over the place, and starting to teach helped me bring my own path into focus a lot more. Writing Quareia was a big turning point for me in terms of my own development. I started writing it in 2014, twenty one years after I started teaching, and the three years it took to write the course was a major learning time for me.

I basically tore apart everything I knew about magical practice and theory, and analysed it. It forced me to look at deeper magical dynamics from a very different perspective, and also highlighted for me how much of my practice was done a particular way just because ‘that is how it is done’. I dismantled all of that, and looked at the core elements of practice, what was necessary and what was baggage. I started to rebuild everything from the ground up, tossing out the baggage and focusing on the actual necessary practice, techniques and skills.

I then had to design practices that would train a student in those techniques and skill sets in very careful specific ways that would also inform and educate the student – it is pointless doing something if you do not understand why, where it came from, what it does, why it does it and what it leads to.

That process really changed my whole personal practical approach to magic: it tightened things up, made them and me more efficient and robust.

**6. When someone does a Tarot reading, are we communicating with our higher selves, the cards themselves, or something else? What are your thoughts on where the information in a Tarot reading comes from?**

I use tarot and other decks as vocabularies that enable me to look, ask, converse and listen. Who or what a person communicates with/uses that vocabulary for is dependent upon the person and their intent. As a contacted magician, I use decks to to talk to inner contacts, to beings, to myself, and to also look at the landscape of a fate pattern, to look at land, a construction, whatever I need to look at in the process of my work.

In terms of decks, the tarot structure is a series of archetypes, number patterns and elemental behaviours. That limits the scope of the vocabulary if you are a magician, and the tarot baseline design is very much rooted in a Christian and European viewpoint even though a lot of people do not realise that. That again limits the scope of how the tarot can be used and what for.

The decks I designed for myself and later, the Quareia Magicians deck, use beings, powers, dynamics, tools, and places as a collective vocabulary. That enables me to have a wider scope of action in divination, and to see the dynamics at play behind a situation. However, the true skill in card divination is not the deck you use, but your own skill of interpretation and understanding. You can use a pack of playing cards to get in depth information if you need to, it is the skill of the reader/magician, not the deck that is the key to skilled readings. But a good working deck that is aligned to what you do makes life a lot easier.

**7. What inspired you to create the Quareia Magicians Deck?**

Long before I started writing Quareia, I was acutely aware that for magicians, there was no clear strongly functioning deck that was flexible and in depth enough to assist a magician in terms of tools/vocabulary. Most that were around at that time were either derivatives of the classic tarot, or were new age ‘arty’ oracle decks that looked great, were very clever intellectually, but were to all intent and purpose, magically useless beyond the shallows.

I had started working on a deck design to make a magical deck that functioned at a good level for magicians, and I worked with [Cassandra Beanland](https://www.redbubble.com/people/ZakuroMedia), a magical artist. We got half way through and then life events hit, and it was put on pause.

I later crossed paths with Stuart Littlejohn in 2011– we had met many years earlier and had fate intersections during the creation of the [Dreampower Tarot](http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/dreampower/) (Stuart was the artist) in the early 90’s.

Stuart told me he had been working on a deck for himself, but it had stalled a couple of years earlier. After many discussions over a three-year period, we realised we were both working on the same thing, and it was around that point in 2013/early 2014 I was also starting to develop the blueprint for the Quareia course. I realised a few modules into the course that the Initiate level students and beyond would seriously need a far more effective magical deck to work with than was currently available. It would need to be itself, be a contacted deck, and geared towards magical practice/divination.

It was one of those moments where all the ingredients are sat there patiently, blinking in the shadows, waiting for the dumbass to realise it was all there ready and just needed putting together. So I tightened up the design and structural pattern I had been working on, and dragged Stuart and Cassandra into finishing it all up. About 25% of the paintings had already been done (all the images are hand painted), so the two artists then had to produce nearly sixty paintings between them to get it finished. It took two years full time painting for them to finish it all, and I wrote the book for the deck while also writing the course.

As a contacted deck, the beings and powers within the images were pretty bossy, and generally gave the artists a rough time – if either one of them strayed from the contacted image, they would have nightmares, or could not complete the painting until they got it right. It was a bit of a job!

I then had to address the issue of ethics – this was a contacted deck for a magical training course and also for working magicians/seers. It could not become heavily commercialized. At the same time, the artists had worked flat out for two years and had to put their own work on hold, and thus made no little or no income during that time. We didn’t want it to go through commercial publishers who would debase it to make it more marketable, and we worried about it being too expensive for Quareia students who had little income.

We crowdfunded to get the printing costs, and got a small print run done. 25% of the print run was put to one side for Quareia students who got to Initiate level training – there would be free decks for them if they needed it. We did the same with the second print run. All the income from the deck sales was/is split between the two artists.

As the second print run is now almost all sold, and at the same time we have been experiencing uncertainly with Brexit here in Britain, we did not know how long we could continue to make it available abroad (customs and import duties etc, and rapidly crumbling international postal service), so Cassandra came up with the idea of producing it through a US print on demand/drop ship service. One snag was that most card printers are set up for a maximum of 80 cards, and the Quareia deck has 81 cards. This makes the production a lot more expensive, but there was no way we were going to ‘drop a card’ to make it cheaper – the numerical pattern within the deck is very magical and needs to be intact. So for now, it is available in the US through the [print on demand site](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/lxxxi-the-quareia-magicians-deck-jumbo-size-edition), which takes a large chunk of the retail price, but at least it keeps it in print and the artists do get something from it. If something else becomes available where we can do it cheaper, we will. And we still have 20% of the last print run to sell to folks in the UK and EU. The book is up as a [free download](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/539af6bee4b0cef061847e36/t/5a4a2b7941920273ab965e9e/1514810243577/deckbook-web.pdf) on the Quareia website (we have a whole [free books section](https://www.quareia.com/texts)) and also available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Lxxxi-Quareia-Magicians-Deck-Book/dp/1911134310/ref=sr_1_12?keywords=josephine+mccarthy&qid=1578312898&sr=8-12).

**8. What advice would you give someone who wants to create their own Tarot or Divination deck?**

My advice would be, don’t just do a copy of the regular tarot… it has been done to death and has its limitations. It is a good starting point for people, but if you truly want to develop your own divination skills, first think about what you want to use the deck for. From there, think about the vocabulary you need, and think carefully about the imagery of that vocabulary – it is not about fancy pictures that look good; each card is a potential window. Do you want a clear focused ‘window’ or one that is so full of distractions? Always think about what you need and go from there.  
Then get a blank pack or two (depending on how many cards you are going to need) and use a name or key word on each card that corresponds to your deck design, and maybe a little picture or sign that can embed itself in your internal vocabulary. Start using the deck and take notes of each card’s strengths and limitations. You may also find, as often happens, that you intend one meaning for a card, but another meaning asserts itself. Add that meaning to the card and continue using your experimental deck. Once you have used it in a bare bones form for a few months, you will have a very good idea of what works and what doesn’t. Then you can start the actual production design.

**9. Aside from the Quareia Magicians Deck, do you have a favourite Tarot deck to work with?**

I only use the Quareia deck and one I made for myself that is itself, its own design and not based on anything else.

**10. How often do you use the Tarot for mundane (non magical) questions**?

Very rarely, and only usually in an emergency. I am assuming by mundane you mean ‘money/job/partner/life in general readings. I tend not to use cards for that unless there are really serious high stakes involved. I do use health readings for urgent issues with people I am close to, or for the animals I tend to, and I consider health readings to be a bridge between magical and mundane.

I don’t do readings for other people, and I am finding that the older I am getting, the less I use them.

**11. Is it important for a Magician to have separate decks for Mundane and Magical questions? Or can one deck be used for different kinds of questions?**

Not really, it is up to the magician. Some magicians prefer to keep things separate, and some don’t. I have realised, through answering these questions, that I tend not to do ‘mundane’ at all in life… for me, everything is magical, hence every time I use a deck, it is magical.

**12. Are there any specific cards that you have a hard time with?**

Depends on the day, the mood and the question…. I have had decks, particularly the Quareia deck, call me an idiot more times than I care to admit. In terms of struggling with a meaning, in the Quareia deck, I have had problems at times with some of the human dynamic cards. When I get a new insight into a card, I will write it in a journal, as any cards from any deck will have more layers than you realise. A card will keep showing up in readings, and it will make no sense to me, so I will keep writing the readings and questions down. Looking back over them is usually when the penny drops and I understand what it was trying to say.

If you remember that cards are a vocabulary, and that vocabulary is limited to a set number of words, then you start to realise that a reading may have scope of meaning beyond the vocabulary..and the card that is nearest to that ‘sort of meaning’ will pop up.

For example in the Quareia deck, there is a human dynamic card called ‘Temptation’. It has come up in a few different health readings for people and animals, and it always had me scratching my head. Then in the middle of the night one night, I woke up with a loud ‘duh’…. It was pointing to a food intolerance or allergy… something that tasted good and was tempting, but was ultimately undermining the health. With that insight I switched foods I was giving to a sick cat, and hey presto, cat problem solved. The poor cat loved the food, but it was making them very sick.

**13. How do you react when you draw a card and aren't sure how to interpret it in the context of the question?**

I swear, moan, make a coffee, and then sit outside with the coffee and a cigarette. I stare at cows and horses (I live in the country), stare at the trees, and talk to my sparrow flock who roost very close to the house and are semi tame. Then I go back inside and look at the reading again. Usually that tends to do the trick.

**14. What are your opinions on Reversed Cards in a Tarot reading? Do you read Reversals?**

I don’t use them. I use layout positions. I design layouts that have negative and positive positions, and where a position also corresponds to a major card (both good and bad). The card that lands in a set position is read in relation to the position meaning, and the home card of that position. That way you get three sources of information. So for example, if you have a layout position that shows the hidden aspects of the story, and its home card is the Moon/Luna, and the tarot card Knight of Swords lands there, you have a young or immature man who could be trouble, who is lurking behind the scenes of the situation and is not being seen for who they really are.

**15. Are all Tarot cards neutral, depending on context? Or are there negative and positive cards?**

With a tarot deck there are positives, negatives and neutrals. However, some negative cards i.e. the Tower can be devastating in the short term, but a necessary destruction that leads to new growth. Similarly, ‘good’ cards, can be short term good but can bring about complacency or overgrowth, and thus can be destructive paths. It all depends upon the context, the interpretation skills of the reader and also wisdom from life experience. It is also worth bearing in mind that readings, particularly mundane ones, are like weather reports. It is what you do with that weather that is important. If there is a hurricane, you don’t just sit outside and get hammered, you either batten down everything and be prepared, or you move inland for a day or two.

**16. What advice would you give to someone just starting to learn Tarot?**

Practice, learn skills, use your common sense, listen to how your body reacts to doing readings (too many can cause fatigue), and don’t hide from yourself. Don’t keep asking the same question to get a better answer, and write down/photograph each reading and log the date and question – you can learn a great deal from looking at a reading in retrospect.

**17. What do you feel is the most misunderstood aspect of Tarot?**

Tarot ☺

**18. What would you like to see change in Tarot and Magical culture?**

Bit of a loaded question that one! I would like to see the ‘feel good fluffy bunny’ mentality fade away, but I am not holding my breath. And also the heavy commercialism. Yeah folks need to earn a living and recoup costs etc, but pumping out deck after deck after deck which is the same shit rehashed over and over again, helps no one and is just a business model.

**19. Through internet and social media, Tarot seems to be experiencing a surge in popularity. Do you think this is a ""Tarot Bubble"" that will burst, or have we crossed a threshold where Tarot will become more acceptable and integrated into society**?

There is a tarot bubble? I must have missed that!! But then again I don’t keep up with what is going on out in the big wide world. Trends come and go, things get popular and then fade, but I think with the current polarisation out there in the world, there will come a time when tarot dives underground again for a while. It has always been that way with peaks and troughs, and this one is no different.

I don't want to hide having a bf in case that's a dealbreaker for a potntial gf, but also it can be interpreted as ""taken, not seeking another relationship"" as I also immideately presumed about her.
I doubt I'll ever go out with her again, but I don't want this to happen again.

It's hard enough to tell someone I like them. But then I should also admit to being bi which I'm not sure what kinda reaction I'll get (although I'm in allegedly quite accepting social surrounding for that kind of thing). And I should also hint at my relationship being open which is a lot of personal and potentially risky info very early on.

How to navigate this? Is it even ok to be searching for a gf if I know I want to marry my bf and stay with him, like he's kinda always my no. 1?

1kndkja,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1kndkja/tbt/,Tbt,"Back in the days at St Claire's girls' high school  there was legedary culture that was created by the Science  department. 
Sciences are known to be a masculine thing but the slogan ""what men can do women can do better"" geared up the girls. The teachers there wanted the girls to live this phrase. Therefore they came up with Kesha  program whereby the learners would have a specific science subject each weekend.
As other schools' were winding up the week and waiting for the long sleeping hours at St. Claire's they couldn't wait for the all nighters problem solving sessions like their lives depended on it. This program used to run from 6Pm- 12Am midnight. 
As time passed, it was working and with time the girls developed an ending love-hate relationship for numbers and caffeine which was provided to keep them active. 

There was this particular  weekend which was a math' s day. The legendary HoD Ms Kinuthia  was a geometry guru.
She not only knew how to  draw circles seamlessly  but also a perfect circle herself. Her moves had more angles and rotations than a trignometry lesson.
She used to carry a very big handbag which was believed to be having maths test papers ready to be unleashed any moment incase she found you on the wrong lanes. That was her weapon of torture, her way to fry us like samosas.

This particular weekend Mrs Kinuthia decided to spice up things. At 11:30Pm when all our brains were shutting down she entered the hall, grining. Gleefully she announced "" Maths is a language of the universe, it can also be the therapy for the soul""
We all stared at her horrified. We couldn't tell what she was upto.
 Majestically she turned and went to the stage. Her curvy behind swinging . She had an hidden agenda. We exchanged glances smiling bracing ourselves for what she was about to unleash.

Then in a playful tone she said "" let us sing some math equations. We have solved them enough"". ""Sing them""? In a chorus we said.  ""Yes!"" She confirmed with a broad smile. Then she started the anthem which is very famous in the school now. 
"" If X is your ex, and Y your why, then solve for Z cause am too high""🤣🤣🤣.
This is left every one in the hall howling with laughter. She can Sing? We had never known this side of her. Every one was giggling. 
We sang that line a few more times off-key till we all got the right tune.
It became the unforgettable duet for the whole school. 
Even the principal had it as her phone ringtone but it was hard for her to admit it. This day  was the day we had  most fun with  maths.
To add salt on the injury more coffee was brought.  Huh! 
A new rule was set at St. Claire's high school from that day. More Maths more coffee more fun.

What we are looking for:
* A smaller town/area 

* 1 to 1.5 hours outside a major center so that if my (currently remote) techie husband is laid off he has a chance of finding a new job

* Good schools that are welcoming to LGBTQ kids

* A decent shot at finding a family Dr

* House prices about 1 to 1.3 million

* Primarily English speaking 

What would be nice:
* Access to lakes or ponds for my fisherman kid

* Some kind of center with a coffee shop or nice restaurant, a farmers market, not just chains

* Possibility of having a larger amount of land

* Fun stuff in the general area like botanical gardens, children's museums, cool playgrounds, climbing adventures 

What we don't care about: 
* Walkability 

* Night life

I'm coming from two roborocks that were vacs only no mops and wanted to upgrade to something that mopes the hardwood on my downstairs level. I only run mopping twice a week friday and monday. Every other day the vac runs it runs in vac only leaving the mop pads behind which is what I want and why I bought the Dreame.

The issues that I'm having:

1. In vac only mode the robot is taking almost 4 times longer to vacuum the same area. To the point where sometimes it runs out of battery life and has to go recharge. It does it on it's own so it's not a huge deal but why does it take so long. Over 3 hours to vacuum 900sq ft. I have it in Clean genius and don't have the suction way up.

2. I have hardwood floors as mentioned previously and my quarter round was stained the same color as my floor, I think this is causing issues on the vacuum. It doesn't seem to want to get close to the walls. i've noticed lots of debris along the walls and when looking at the map, I can see the mop isn't getting close to the walls. I've tried to find an adjustment for this but nothing seems to help.

3. Recently and this is the biggest issue I'm seeing clumps of debris where it looks like the unit just didn't suck stuff up but pushed it into a pile I have a 80lbs yellow lab. She sheds a lot, the roborock kept the house to the point you wouldn't know we had a dog but this new vacuum, I'm constantly finding hair tufts places.

4. I have rugs in all rooms since we have hardwood floors. My rugs have designs on them, they aren't just a single flat color, I think the unit constantly thinks these patterns or color changes are obstacles and tries to avoid them. It doesn't vacuum in a standard pattern across a rug this is the only thing I can think of for why this is happening.

5. Don't get me started on the pet feature. My dog could care less about this robot and won't move. She's grown up with them and doesn't care if they bump her or anything. This thing is supposed to take pictures of your pet. I've gotten probably 10 pictures, none of which are of my dog, mostly chair legs, corner of walls, table leg, edge of rug, I did once get a picture where my dogs hind leg was partially in the picture but the main picture was of my door.. This isn't an important thing for me, it's just crazy how bad it is at doing something they tout as a feature and again my dog doesn't move away from it or run, she will lay there and stare at it while it vacuums around here.

I've uploaded some photos this unit takes, I've spent way to much time telling the unit about miss recognition only to have the same thing pop up two days later. You can see in the one picture what the robot thought was a pet with 77% certainty. That's a giant wooden coffee table.

I wouldn't say anything in my house is difficult to navigate. I think in the 5 years I had the roborock it vacuumed daily and got stuck maybe 3 times. This has been stuck already 5 or 6 times and I've had to add more no go zones than I had with my previous vacuum.

I'm questioning how this vacuum is rated so highly. Are things getting to the point where robot vacuums are just being built for some of the large reviewer studios to push sales? Now that I watch some of the reviews, I can see where their studio makes things like navigation much easier compared to an actual house. ",1,1747328659.0,Dreame_Tech,1,1.0,False

what neighborhoods do you recommend where I can rent a house but not accidentally end up in the suBurbS with a bunch of families harboring small children? side note-- I've looked at some of those neighborhoods and I actually like the newer home builds so part of me likes those areas.

Initially, in which you can see in pictures 1, 2, & 3, we had our setup so that the couch is in the middle, facing the fireplace, with the TV on the left side and chair on the right. However, this causes an unpleasant viewing experience for anyone sitting on the left side of the couch, as they have to turn their back to see the TV. It would be better placed on the right side, however someone in our family does not like that and would want to be able to see the TV from the kitchen. Now, in pictures 4, 5, & 6, you can see the (attempted) solution I had, where the TV is placed against the left wall and the couch turned to face it. I, and most of the other people in my family, agree that they like the second arrangement, as they can see the TV at all positions on the couch, along with seeing it from the kitchen as well. And, since I don’t really like the glass coffee table we have, I planned to get rid of it and use the ottoman for its intended purpose. (I had just put the table to the side since we had no where else to put it) BUT, a certain family member of mine despises the second arrangement, stating that it looks horrendous as everything is meant to be ‘centered’, and has since moved everything back to the first arrangement. 
Now initially this pissed me off a little, but after calming down a bit, I realized what they had meant by everything not looking ‘centered’, so I’m taking to Reddit to see if there are any solutions to this that could potentially resolve both of our issues. Eventually, I planned to move the current couch down to our basement and get a new couch, so any solutions could involve anything (i.e. getting a better couch to match the room, getting a different chair, console, paintings, etc).

1. Turn on the machine
2. Place the kcup in the machine and close the lid
3. Wait for the blinking lights to go solid
4. Press the button to start brewing

Now, if we want to use this smart plug and set it up to start brewing coffee at a certain time in the morning, I can configure the smart plug app and create a schedule, that's easy. But for the portion of it where the manual steps would be, I will need your help please.

1knd8x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1knd8x7/discover_if_oneisall_dog_clipper_26225202003de_is/,Discover if Oneisall Dog Clipper 26225202-003DE is the Best Grooming Kit Review,"The **oneisall 26225202-003DE Dog Clipper** became a game-changer in my pet grooming kit recently. I decided to try it out after hearing all the buzz about its low-noise performance and ease of use. Featuring a rechargeable, cordless design, this dog grooming kit appeared to tick all the right boxes for someone like me—someone battling fluffy fur overload on a daily basis. While I found many merits to this tool, there are certainly a few aspects worth considering.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek, gold finish and lightweight design of this pet grooming device are undoubtedly eye-catching. At just 13.4 ounces, it feels sturdy in hand but not cumbersome during use. Its ergonomic handle fits comfortably, even during long grooming sessions with my fluffiest dog. What really caught my attention was the thoughtfulness of the design, especially the inclusion of six guide combs ranging from 3mm to 18mm. That flexibility made it easy to switch up the length, whether I was trimming my Shih Tzu’s thick fur or maintaining the smooth coat of my Chihuahua. A simple one-touch start mechanism ensured that even my wobbly coffee-fueled hands could get to work without fuss.  

[Check oneisall 26225202-003DE price on Amazon.](https://petof.com/p/b01hrszrxm/)

**Performance That Stands Out**  
Testing the clippers on both cats and dogs, I was impressed with how efficient they were for thick and fine fur alike. The stainless steel fixed blade lived up to its promise: sharp and precise, yet meticulously safe thanks to its three-layer protection design. I found myself marveling at how easily it glided through my Australian Shepherd’s dense coat without pulling or tugging at their fur. The motor operates below 50 decibels, so even my anxious rescue cat, who usually bolts at the sound of regular clippers, sat relatively relaxed during the process. However, for pets with thicker fur, I had to do a preliminary trim using the included scissors to avoid snagging, as instructed in the notes.  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
This clipper feels like it was built with beginners in mind. Even my teenager, who's never groomed a dog before, was able to pick it up and use it efficiently within minutes. The snap-on blades can be removed easily for cleaning, which is a total lifesaver when your schedule is packed. Rinsing the parts with water took no more than a minute, leaving the blades ready for the next round. Plus, the device can function while charging—a real lifesaver when I forgot to juice it up before starting the grooming job.

**Highlights**  
- Exceptionally quiet motor below 50 dB, reducing stress for pets.  
- Versatile with six guide combs for adjustable clipping lengths.  
- Rechargeable and can operate while plugged in, preventing downtime.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Struggles slightly with long or very thick fur without prior trimming.  
- The gold finish, though attractive, picks up smudges quickly.  
- Limited to occasional small cleaning due to blade size, unsuitable for professional grooming services.

**Challengers**  
The pet grooming market offers similar cordless clippers that claim to be game changers. For instance, the Wahl Lithium Ion Pro delivers comparable quiet operation and cutting precision. However, it lacks the beginner-friendly ease of oneisall’s detachable guide combs. The Andis UltraEdge is another competitor with a sharper blade system but doesn’t match the noise control or affordability. Where the oneisall tool stands out is its balance of features and simplicity, which makes it approachable for everyday pet owners. Compared to these products, the device excels in design intended for novice groomers, though might fall short when tackling bulkier coats.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering its performance and versatility, the price of this dog clipper feels justified. It doesn’t just cater to one type of pet owner but opens its usability to anyone with patience and a furry friend to care for. The market may be packed with similar products, but many either lack features or come at a higher cost for fewer benefits. No, it’s not a professional-grade tool for groomers, but for those of us trying to tidy up at home and save a little from expensive grooming services, this product is fantastic.

1knd7ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1knd7ms/hosting_people_overnight_sucks/,Hosting people overnight sucks,"I have continuously felt a dislike for hosting people overnight. Throwing parties and gatherings at our house are fine but hosting overnight during multiple days has been something I’ve slowly come to realize I strongly dislike. 

We moved overseas temporarily and so last month my husband’s mom and grandma came to visit and stay a whole 10 days. I found myself burnt out by the second night they were around. The amount of work it takes to host people for multiple days is exhausting. Routines get shaken, the amount of entertaining we have to do is endless, the feel of being a “hotel” or a “BnB”, cooking and cleaning it’s all too much!  My husband loves hosting, he thrives in making others feel welcomed and have a great stay. He will literally cook amazing food, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Coffee, drinks, I mean, you name it. He does it all. He constantly tells me to sit and not to worry about it, he’s got it. But I always end up feeling bad watching him run around trying to cater to the guests that I end up helping. Whether is cleaning the kitchen, or washing the dishes or helping him cook. 

I normally tend to stay away from the catering aspect because, no. Why am I acting like a maid, chef and hotel staff?  After the first meal on the first day, the guest can cook their own breakfast or lunch if they’re hungry. The food is there in the fridge to be used. We don’t have to do it for yall!  But my husband tells them to relax and that they’re on vacation while he does it all.  So is stay away and not help because it annoys me to see the guests just in launching in the chair watching him run around like a chicken with its head cut off. 

Also, I’m currently 9 months pregnant. I’m tired and I standing on my feet for long periods of time irritates my pelvic bone (lmao, if you know you know! For those who have never been pregnant. It sucks! lol don’t do it). When his mom and grandma came last month I was 8months and I was helping him clean and cook and I felt so annoyed and irritated at the fact that I’m wobbling around like a California seal while the guests just watched and drank fancy-made drinks. I talked to my husband about it and he understood, apologized and we moved on. I did tell him I wasn’t willing to host people for more than 4 days after this. 

Some of our friends, a couple, had already purchased their ticket to come visit by the time that conversation with my husband happened. So last week, they came and stayed for 4 nights. Now I’m 9 months pregnant and I’m absolutely not in the mood to be acting like a bed and breakfast or a hotel maid. My husband tells me they are only staying for the amount of time I had said was ok and the last day they were staying at a hotel downtown and having date night for them, which works.  Jokes on me. By their second day my husband was again cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner. Prepping cocktails, cleaning the kitchen, washing the dishes. He was doing it all while they sat and watched him. He had told them in advance that he’d accept help when cooking/cleaning because he didn’t want to repeat what happened when his mom visited and I felt like I was picking up the slack. But I only heard them help a couple of times. Mostly watched them watch him cook and clean. I remained seated because, fuck that. No. 

We did some stuff, play board games, drove them around, the whole thing and I was feeling incredibly exhausting. Socially and physically. We dropped them off at the airport and came back home but it was late at night. So the next day we wake up and though the guests are gone, the work from having them is not yet over. We have to wash their bed sheets, their towels, clean the bathroom they used, put the dishes up from the night before, vacuum and generally clean the entire house.  Normally, I keep my house clean all the time. I sweep and mop and clean bathrooms once or twice a week. But when having guests, you can’t really do that without looking rude or making them feel they are dirtying up your house (even if it’s true). 
And now the day after we are having to do all of that on top of our own typical routine. 
My husband was trying to clean it all by himself but, hell, it’s my house too and I want to clean it as well. So I clean the upstairs while he does the downstairs area. It’s all good until i go to the guest bedroom and to my horror the quilt for the bed is stained with fucking blood. Yes period blood. They had attempted to clean it off but it didn’t work. The stain was there as well as the stain on the fucking mattress. 

I was livid. I know it’s not my husband’s fault but I was so incredibly upset anyway. Because we are currently living in a European country (I won’t say where to avoid too many details just in case), the washers and dryers are so tiny. No way we can wash an entire heavy, thick quilt in the washer. So we have to go to the laundry mat and wash that along with the sheets (our friends wash them in the washer but I’m doing it again anyway) and scrub the fucking mattress away. 

This is where I told my husband that this was the last time ever again. I didn’t care who it was, his family, his friends, our friends, my friends, my family, the gods themselves, nobody will be staying at our house overnight. If they want to visit the country, cool, we’ll hang out but stay at a hotel. Not here. I’m so annoyed and pissed that my entire day was consumed by cleaning, washing, more cleaning and then the laundry mat and a ruin mattress later, I could finally sit down. 

I felt bad for my husband because he was trying his hardest to do it all without me moving a finger but things just kept coming up, tons of hairs left in the bathroom, a washcloth with what looked like period blood stains on it, dirty ass sink, dirty ass floor ugh!! But he agreed that after having a baby things are going to be busier for us to be catering to people. And we won’t have the time or spare time to be cooking and cleaning up like we’re some sort of city hotel. 

And with that, I stand by the fact that hosting people overnight sucks. This is a hill I’m willing to die on. 

Edit: also, I want to end this by saying I love our friends and family and i absolutely enjoy their company but hosting overnight multiple days on end is simply not something  I want to do. Nor was I born with the love to do that, like my husband lol. ",30,1747328096.0,Millennials,42,0.74,False

I’ve (25m) lived here my entire life. I’ve tried... I’ve gone to the events, invited people, volunteered, joined groups, showed up consistently, and reached out more times than I can count. I was positive something would click—that just someone would be receptive, include me, or even just remember I was there.

They didn’t.

People flake. Groups gatekeep. Most events feel extremely cliquey and surface level. You show up alone and leave feeling more alone. I stopped going months ago and not a single person noticed I disappeared.

Lansing loves to say it has a ""community."" But unless you’re already woven into the right college group, art circle, or social scene? It’s like yelling at a brick wall.

This isn’t bitterness. It’s a warning for anyone who thinks this city guarantees connection just because it has bars, music nights, coffee shops, and festivals. You can do everything “right” here and still be completely isolated.

So if you’re here and feeling unseen, tired, or shut out, you're not crazy and you're not alone. And if you’re lucky enough to not feel this way, I hope you’ll think twice before telling someone to “just put themselves out there.” Some of us already have. Over and over again.

# The ""Search Intent Spectrum"" Framework

**Step 1: Select 5 Target Keywords**

Choose 5 broad keywords that:

* Represent your core products/services
* Have decent search volume
* Allow for multiple search intents

For example, if you sell coffee equipment, you might target: ""coffee makers,"" ""espresso machines,"" ""pour over coffee,"" ""coffee grinders,"" ""french press.""

**Step 2: Map the Four Search Intents**

For each keyword, create content for all four search intents:

**1. Informational Intent** (Users want to learn):

* Ultimate guides
* How-to tutorials
* Explainer articles
* Educational resources

**2. Navigational Intent** (Users want to compare options):

* Comparison articles
* ""X vs Y"" posts
* ""Best alternatives to X"" content
* Decision guides

**3. Commercial Investigation** (Users are considering purchase):

* Case studies
* Testimonials
* Reviews
* Product comparison charts
* Use case scenarios

**4. Transactional Intent** (Users want to buy):

* Product pages
* Landing pages
* Special offers
* Buying guides

**Step 3: Use Intent-Specific Content Formats**

Tailor your content structure to match each intent:

**For Informational Content:**

* Detailed guides with table of contents
* Step-by-step tutorials with images
* FAQ sections
* Diagrams and explanations

**For Navigational Content:**

* Comparison tables
* Pros/cons lists
* Decision trees
* Feature breakdowns

**For Commercial Investigation:**

* Social proof elements
* Expert opinions
* Use case examples
* ROI calculations

**For Transactional Content:**

* Clear CTAs
* Urgency elements
* Testimonials
* Purchase information

**Step 4: Create an Intent Journey with Internal Linking**

Build progressive internal linking that guides users through the intent journey:

* Link from informational → navigational → commercial → transactional
* Use contextual anchor text that matches the next stage of intent
* Place links strategically at ""decision points"" in content

Here's what the internal linking looks like for one keyword:

    Informational
    ""Ultimate Guide to Pour Over Coffee""
             ↓
    Navigational
    ""Pour Over vs. French Press: Which Brewing Method is Right for You?""
             ↓
    Commercial
    ""The 5 Best Pour Over Coffee Makers for Different Budgets""
             ↓
    Transactional
    ""Premium Pour Over Coffee Kit with Free Shipping""

**Step 5: Create Content Upgrades for Each Intent**

At each stage, offer intent-specific lead magnets:

* **Informational**: Checklists, cheat sheets, printable guides
* **Navigational**: Comparison worksheets, decision matrices
* **Commercial**: Case study collections, sample products
* **Transactional**: Discount codes, bundle offers, free shipping

**This works because:**

* **Complete Coverage**: You're capturing users at every stage of their journey
* **Perfect Alignment**: Content precisely matches what users are looking for
* **Natural Progression**: You guide users through their decision process
* **Higher Conversions**: You end up getting qualified leads
* **Focused Effort**: Every piece of content has a clear purpose and goal

OLIVIA'S POV

I lit the last candle, adjusting it slightly to balance the warm glow across the room. Soft music played in the background, and the bedside table was set with Adrian’s favorite wine.

Tonight had to be perfect.

I smoothed the silk lingerie which I had bought just for tonight with my trembling hands as I checked myself in the mirror one last time.

The sound of the door opening downstairs sent a chill down my spine. My heart raced.

Adrian was home.

I hurried to the edge of the bed, holding my cold hands together.

The door to the bedroom swung open, and there he was, he never ceases to take my breath away. His perfect angelic figure filled the doorway, his tie loose and suit wrinkled which was a rare sight for my always composed husband.

“What are you doing in my room?” His cold voice echoed in the room interrupting my thoughts.

I quickly stood up from the edge of the bed and my hands gripped a small portion of the fabric of my silk lingerie suddenly felt ridiculous in the outfit that I'd spent hours picking at the mall.

“I… I thought we could spend some time together,” I stammered.

His gaze swept across the room from the flickering candles, the soft music, the wine and finally landed on me.

His expression hardened and became darker causing me to shiver.

“I didn’t ask for an explanation,” he said coldly. “Blow out the candles and get out.”

I froze, his words hitting harder than they should have.

“Adrian,” I said quietly, forcing a smile that felt fragile. “It’s been a month since you’ve been home. Can’t we just talk for a moment?”

He let out a deep breath, rubbing his forehead as though I were an inconvenience. “I’m tired, Olivia. Don’t make this harder than it needs to be.”

“I’ve waited for you for one month!” My voice cracked, and I hated how desperate I sounded. “I thought…”

“I said I’m tired. Are you deaf?” His tone was final and harsh.

I bit back the lump in my throat.

I was in love and this is what love does, it makes you foolish. It makes you endure things you never thought you would.

You might ask me why I married him when I knew this was how he behaved towards me. It would shock you to know that Adrian wasn't always like this.

When we were dating, Adrian was sweet, thoughtful and caring. He made me believe I was the only woman meant for him and I fell for it. I agreed to marry him but the night we got married Adrian changed.

He became cold and distant, he even left me alone in the suites on our wedding night and went off to God knows where. I didn't see my husband until a week later.

No intimacy, no honeymoon, nothing!

I took a shaky breath and decided to try again. “Maybe I can help you relax just like the night before you travelled. We could…”

His dry, cold laugh cut me off. “Help me? Do you think I’d want to have anything to do with you? The last time was a drunken mistake.”

He shook his head. “Stop trying so hard, Olivia. It’s pathetic.”

Drunken mistake? Pathetic?

The words felt like a slap that stung so bad on my cheeks. My fists clenched at my sides as I fought back tears in my eyes.

“Is it pathetic to want my husband to care? To hope that after one month, you might want to be with me tonight?” My voice rose despite the lump in my throat.

He sneered, gesturing to the room. “This…” he waved a hand at the candles, the wine, the silk lingerie.

“This isn’t going to fix anything. It only makes me hate you more. Stop embarrassing yourself.”

My chest tightened. “Hate me?” I whispered, barely able to get the words out.

He sighed, glaring at me. “I think you should stop holding on to something that never existed.”

He once swore that he loved me and now he is saying nothing ever existed?

How could someone who used to love me so much turned into this cold heartless person? I just… I don't get it.

If he claims nothing ever existed between us why then did he marry me?

My chest ached, but I refused to let the tears welled up in my eyes fall.

“For three years you've been hurting my emotions time after time, and you act like you don’t care.”

Adrian scoffed. “Olivia, don’t get me wrong, I’m not acting. I actually don’t care. I never did, and I never will. Get that into your thick, empty skull. Do you understand?”

My breath caught in my throat as I stared at him in disbelief. How could he say such hurtful things to me?

“Then why did you ask for my hand in marriage?” I shouted, my voice shook. “Why marry me, Adrian? Why?”

Adrian’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t answer. Instead, he turned his back at me and headed toward the bathroom.

The door slammed shut behind him, leaving me alone with the flickering candles. Their warm light mocking the effort I had put into this night.

I sank onto the bed, I couldn't hold back the tears anymore as they streamed down my cheeks. My heart ached and I clutched my chest tightly hoping to relieve the pain.

Adrian’s phone buzzed on the nightstand bringing me back from my emotions.

Normally, I wouldn’t touch it. He was always so protective of it. But tonight, something compelled me. Maybe it was the pain, the betrayal, or the small voice in my head telling me not to mind my own business this time.

I picked up the phone, my hands trembled as I read the message.

Dora ❤️: “I enjoyed the vacation with you. Sweet dreams 💋.”

Vacation?

My heart stopped and I was unable to breathe properly for a while.

Adrian had told me he was on a business trip and I'd waited for him for one whole month only to discover that he was with another woman.

The phone slipped from my hands as the truth settled in my chest like a ton of blocks.

Adrian stepped out of the bathroom, a towel draped over his shoulders, I couldn't stop myself. “Who is Dora?”

# CHAPTER 002

OLIVIA'S POV

My body felt heavy as I woke up the next day, the events of last night came flooding back. Adrian’s cruel words echoed in my head like a noise I just couldn't get rid of.

Even after I confronted him about who Dora was he just snatched his phone and left the room without giving me any explanation, leaving me with a broken heart.

But I couldn't conclude yet, Adrian might not really be cheating on me, the text message wasn't enough evidence.

But one thing was certain, I was determined to find out who Dora was.

I sat up slowly, the ache in my chest sharper than ever. I reached for my phone and checked the time. It was 9:30 am.

My heart sank.

I was never one to wake up late, but I guess the emotional hurt I experienced the previous night had clearly drained me.

I gripped the edge of the bed to steady myself. “You're his wife,” I reminded myself. “You made vows. You can’t give up yet.”

I decided to make breakfast for Adrian. I deceived my brain into thinking that if I kept on trying Adrian would one day notice my efforts.

When I stepped into the kitchen, Martha, our housekeeper, was already there, humming softly as she whisked eggs in a bowl.

She looked up when she heard me enter. “Good morning, Mrs. Westwood,” she greeted politely, though concern flickered in her eyes. “You’re up late today. Should I prepare breakfast for you and Mr. Westwood?”

I shook my head. “No, Martha. I’ll handle it.”

Her brows furrowed. “Are you sure? I…”

“I just… I want to do this myself today.” I said softly, cutting her short with a faint smile.

She hesitated but eventually nodded. “All right, ma’am. I’ll be in the garden if you need me.”

I turned to the stove, cooked an omelet, toasted bread, and poured coffee. Maybe Adrian would appreciate the effort, maybe he would see I was trying.

When Adrian appeared, he was already dressed up for work, he didn't even glance at me. He sat at the table, scrolling through his phone as if I weren't there.

I approached cautiously, setting the plate in front of him. “Good morning,” I said, a small smile spread across my face. “I made breakfast.”

He didn’t look up, but his hand reached for the fork. I stood there, watching anxiously as he took a bite.

The moment the food touched his tongue, his expression twisted in disgust. He spat it out into a napkin, glaring at me.

“What is this?” he yelled, pushing the plate away.

“It’s…” My voice trembled. “I thought I’d make you breakfast.”

He stood, grabbing a glass of water and rinsing his mouth. “Don’t bother next time,” he said coldly. “If I wanted to die of food poisoning, I'd let you know.”

I bit my lower lips so hard in a bid to suppress the pain his words caused me.

After speaking, he grabbed his briefcase and strode toward the door without another word.

And I broke down in tears. My tears were the only thing that has been consistent in my marriage.

I heard a footstep approaching and I knew it was Martha. I quickly used the back of my hands to wipe off my tears.

I knew Martha was aware of the situation in my marriage but I still couldn't let her see me cry. I didn't want to receive pity from her, because that would hurt even more.

Martha wore a sympathetic look as she approached. “Mr. Westwood told me to inform you that you should be ready by 7 pm. He’ll pick you up for the gala.”

I nodded, numb. The gala. Of course. That must have been why he came home last night so that we could deceive the world into believing that we were a perfect couple.

It wasn't about me. It was never about me.

The thought crushed me, but I forced myself to remain calm.

By 6:45 pm, I was ready. Staring at myself in the mirror I noticed a slight change in my body but I shrugged it off.

I wore a white gown that hugged my figure. It was Adrian’s favorite color then when we were dating, though I doubted he’d notice it this evening.

When he arrived, he barely glanced at me. “Let’s go,” he said plainly, heading toward the car.

My heart dropped to my stomach, stupid of me to be expecting a compliment.

The ride to the gala was silent, the tension in the air was so thick that I felt suffocated. I was uncomfortable and feeling a bit nauseous.

I needed fresh air so I wound down the car window and stared out, clutching my bag tightly as I tried to calm the storm inside me.

When we arrived, cameras flashed, capturing the image of us as the world's perfect couple.

Adrian stepped out first, extending a hand to help me, acting like a perfect husband for the camera.

What a hypocrite he is!

Everyone never missed a chance to remind me of how lucky I was to marry Adrian.

Lol, only if they knew what I faced in my marriage every day. This is one of the reasons you shouldn't always envy couples who seem sweet on the internet.

Inside, the ballroom glittered with chandeliers and laughter, but I felt invisible. Adrian was the center of attention, charming the guests with his charisma while I trailed behind him like a shadow.

No one acknowledged me. No one asked how I was doing.

It was as if I didn’t exist.

I was about to excuse myself to the ladies’ room when a voice cut through the hum of conversation.

“Adrian!”

I turned toward the source of the voice. She was stunning, her red gown hugged her curves in all the right places. Her radiant smile lit the room and I must admit she looked like she had just stepped out of a magazine.

I won't lie, I felt slightly intimidated.

Adrian’s face lit up in a way I hadn’t seen in three years. “Dora,” he said, his tone warm, almost affectionate.

My breath ceased.

Dora? Could it be the Dora from the text message last night? The one he went on a vacation with?

My heart raced in my chest, I stared at them, my stomach churning.

Adrian didn’t even bother introducing me.

“Adrian,” I said softly, hoping to remind him of my existence.

But he ignored me completely and pretended as if he didn't hear me call out his name.

He leaned closer to Dora and whispered something in her ears, and she laughed, the sound caused a sharp pain in my chest.

She rested her hand on Adrian’s arm in a way that made my blood boil.

“You haven’t changed at all,” she teased. “Still so charming.”

“And you’re as beautiful as ever,” Adrian replied, his smile genuine – a smile I hadn’t seen or had even been directed at me in years.

It was as if a knife had been driven into my chest and was continuously being twisted as I watched them chat.

They chatted like lovers, her hand lingered on his arm, her gaze filled with something possessive.

I stood there, a ghost, as they flirted openly and I couldn't do anything about it. And it hurts.

Dora glanced at me, her lips curling into a sly smirk. “Oh, Adrian, I didn’t realize you had company.”

Huh… She didn't notice? Even a toddler would know I was his company.

I turned towards Adrian hoping to hear his response but his response was like a punch to my face.

“She’s just here for the gala, nothing more,” he said dismissively.

Just here for the gala?

Dora's smirk deepened. “Oh… well, Adrian. Since you don't have any company, why don't we find somewhere quiet to continue our discussion? It’s so noisy here.”

Adrian didn’t hesitate. “That sounds like a good idea.”

I couldn't believe my ears, was he going to leave me here alone?

No, he can't! He knows I don't know anyone here so he might ask me to join them.

Adrian turned to me briefly. “Book a ride home,” he said coldly.

I felt my heart shatter into a million pieces right at that spot.

And with that, he walked away, Dora's hand on his arm, leaving me standing there in the middle of the crowded room where I knew no one.

# CHAPTER 003

OLIVIA'S POV

Adrian didn’t come home that night and I wasn't comfortable since I knew he left with HER. I waited in bed, staring at the clock as hours passed. Midnight approached and still, there was no sign of him.

Was he spending the night with her? Was Adrian really cheating on me?

My chest felt hollow, the silence of the house taunting me. Sleep refused to come, so I sat up, hugging my knees, wondering if I’d ever truly mattered to him.

The next morning, I decided I couldn’t wait around in the house for him anymore. I needed to see him, to talk to him, to get to know who Dora was to him even if it meant facing his anger or indifference.

I didn't care anymore.

I told myself this was my right as his wife, even if he seemed to forget that fact.

I arrived at his office, my heart pounding as I approached the desk of his secretary, a chubby woman named Rita. She looked up from her computer, her expression neutral.

“Good morning, Mrs. Westwood,” she greeted politely, though her tone was quite different.

“I need to see Adrian,” I said, my voice calm despite the storm building inside me.

Rita hesitated, her fingers placed on her keyboard. “I’m sorry, ma’am, but Mr. Westwood has given strict instructions not to be disturbed.”

My cheeks flushed with embarrassment. I could feel the humiliation crawling up my spine. She knew I was his wife, yet she still denied me entry.

This is the humiliation I constantly have to endure ever since I married Adrian.

“Please,” I said, lowering my voice. “It’s important.”

Her lips pressed into a thin line. “I’m afraid I can’t, ma’am. Mr. Westwood doesn’t want to see anyone right now.”

Before I could respond, the door to Adrian’s office swung open. My breathing stopped for a moment as I saw him step out, his deep laugh filling the hallway.

He wasn’t alone.

Walking beside him was Dora, her heels clicking confidently against the marble floor.

What was she doing here?

Adrian’s expression was the same as hers – light, carefree, so unlike the cold mask he wore around me.

I remain rooted to my spot, unsure whether to stay or walk away. They were lost in conversation, their voices low but filled with warmth. I wondered if they saw me or were pretending not to have.

When they reached the lobby, Adrian turned to Dora with a smile. “I’ll see you later,” he said, his tone easy and familiar like how he talked to me before our marriage.

Dora leaned closer, brushing a hand against his arm. “Don’t forget about our plans.”

What plans?

He nodded, his smile unwavering.

As she walked off, her eyes darted to me for a brief moment, her lips curving into a knowing smirk before she disappeared into the elevator.

My hands clenched into fists, my knuckles turning white. Adrian turned to head back into his office, but I stepped forward, blocking his path.

“Adrian,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

He stopped, his gaze cold as it settled on me.

“What are you doing here?” he asked, his tone devoid of any emotion.

“I came to talk,” I replied, fighting the anger in my voice. “Why didn't you come…”

“Not now,” he cut me off, signaling to Rita with his hand. “Make sure no one disturbs me.”

Rita stepped forward, her presence creating a distance between us.

“But…” I started, only for him to turn and walk back into his office, the door clicking shut behind him.

The humiliation burned like fire in my chest. I didn’t argue further. I couldn't keep on embarrassing myself there was no point. I made my way to the car garage.

My marriage was supposed to be my shield, my safe place, but here, it was nothing more than a badge of shame.

In the dimly lit garage, I spotted Dora standing by her car, her posture relaxed as she waited. When our eyes met, her smirk returned, sharper this time.

“You look upset,” she said, her tone dripping with mock concern. “Rough day?”

I ignored her, walking to my car, but she stepped in front of me, blocking my path.

“You know, Olivia,” she began, her voice sweet but laced with venom, “you really shouldn’t cling to a man who clearly doesn’t want you. It’s… sad and pathetic.”

I told myself to calm down, I refused to let her see my pain. “Is there something you want?” I asked, keeping my tone as steady as I could.

She laughed, a sound that made my chest tighten. “I just thought I’d give you some girly advice.”

I clenched my fists, biting back the urge to lash out. “Are you done?” I asked, but didn't wait for her response.

As I opened my car door, her parting words reached me. “You’re fighting a losing battle, Olivia. You should know when to quit.”

I drove home in silence, her words settling over me like a dark cloud.

That night, Adrian didn’t come home early which had become a routine ever since he came back from his supposed business trip.

And I knew it was because of Dora.

Curiosity got the best of me, and I found myself walking toward the one place Adrian had forbidden me to enter – his study.

I had a strong feeling that I might find something there that would reveal more about Dora and her relationship with Adrian.

I hesitated in front of the door, my pulse racing, but Dora’s smug smile flashed in my mind and I found myself breaking the rules I hadn't broken in three years.

While going through his drawers, I stumbled upon an old, slightly worn-out photograph that made my heartbeat slow and froze me in place.

It was a picture of young Adrian, a pretty woman holding him close, whom I assumed to be his mother because of the resemblance, and my parents, all smiling at the camera.

Everything in me screamed confusion. Why were they together? How was this possible?

My parents never seemed to know Adrian when I first introduced him to them, and even Adrian never mentioned knowing my parents.

My head was filled with different questions, each one adding to the headache that was starting to build.

Why hadn’t Adrian mentioned knowing my parents? Was he hiding something from me? Or was there something my parents had kept from me?

I was snapped back to reality when I heard the door click open downstairs. My heart leaped, and I quickly shoved the photograph back into the drawer, my hands trembling as I hurried back to the bedroom.

Adrian walked in without a word, and the room was filled with the stench of alcohol. I stood awkwardly by the bed, unsure whether to speak or remain silent.

Without warning, he closed the distance between us, his hands gripped my waist.

I hated the way my heart leaped, I knew I should have pushed him, yelled at him, or better still slapped him but I found myself yearning for more.

My heart thumped faster as he kissed me, his movements hungry like a lion that had been starved for days.

“Adrian,” I whispered, but he silenced me, pulling me closer and undressing me.

I knew I shouldn't enjoy it but I did.

That night, he touched me for the second time in three years.

I remembered the first time we were intimate a month ago he was drunk and tonight he was also drunk.

I knew what it meant but I deceived my mind into thinking that it was a hope that things might get better.

The next morning, Adrian acted as if nothing had happened. He stood by the dresser, buttoning his shirt while I lay in bed, watching him.

“Good morning,” I greeted, a blush creeping up my cheeks.

He didn’t respond, his focus was on his tie.

“Adrian,” I said softly, sitting up. “About last night…”

He turned to me, his expression cold. “What about it?”

I hesitated, unsure how to interpret his tone. “I… I just thought…”

“Don’t overthink it,” he interrupted. “I sent some money to your account. Consider it payment for your services.”

His words hit me like a punch to the gut. My lips parted, but no sound came out.

Without another glance, he grabbed his briefcase and left, leaving me sitting there in stunned silence.

Tears blurred my vision as I clutched the sheets, my heart bleeding.

Was this what I had become? A service to be paid for?

# CHAPTER 004

OLIVIA'S POV

I gripped the steering wheel, my hands tight as I drove. I had no destination in mind I just needed to leave the house that constantly reminded me of my failing marriage and emotionally unavailable husband.

The words Adrian had said that morning kept playing in my head, no matter how much I tried to distract myself.

My chest hurt, and I wanted to scream. Three years of marriage, and yet, I was just something he could use. I didn’t know where I was going. I just needed to get away.

Eventually, hours later, I drove back home. I parked in the driveway but stayed in the car for a minute, taking deep breaths. My eyes were still red from crying, and everything felt heavy inside me.

When I finally walked inside, the first thing I saw was a pair of red heels by the door. They weren’t mine. My stomach dropped, and panic rushed in.

I took a deep breath and started walking upstairs. With every step, my heart beat faster. I wanted to turn around and run, but something inside me kept going forward, pushing me to face whatever was waiting.

When I reached the bedroom door, I hesitated. My hand gripped the handle for a while. But I pushed it open anyway.

What I saw froze me.

Dora was lying on the bed, half-dressed, her gown slipping off her shoulder. Adrian was next to her, still in his shirt and pants, fast asleep.

My stomach twisted. I felt like I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think. For a second, I just stood there, staring at them, still not believing my eyes.

Adrian cheating on me was something I could overlook because of love but what I could never take was him bringing his mistress to our home on our matrimonial bed.

That was a disrespect I could never tolerate.

“Adrian!” I shouted, my voice echoing in the room.

Adrian’s eyes fluttered open. He blinked and then looked at me.

A look of confusion crossed his face as he glanced over at Dora who was lying next to him but in a blink of an eye, his face went from that to something colder, more distant.

“Olivia,” he said, voice groggy. He rubbed his eyes like he was just waking from a nap.

I wanted to scream, but I kept my fists clenched and stared at him, waiting for an explanation. Then Dora moved beside him, stretching and smiling at me.

“Oh, Olivia,” she said sweetly, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “You’re home early.”

Her smile, her tone – it made everything worse.

“What is this… Adrian?” I asked, my voice breaking.

He sighed and ran a hand through his hair, looking tired. “Calm down, Olivia,” he said like it was my fault.

“Calm down?” I repeated, my voice getting louder. “You brought her into our matrimonial bed, and now you want me to calm down?”

Dora laughed softly, wrapping the blanket around herself like she was perfectly at ease. “Oh, darling,” she said, her eyes sharp, “don’t make a scene.”

Her words made me sick, but I refused to let her see me lose control. I turned to Adrian. “You don’t even care enough to deny it?”

He looked at me with no emotion, then shrugged. “There’s nothing to deny,” he said, his voice cold.

That hit me like a punch. I felt weak, but I forced myself to stay standing.

He wasn't even remorseful of his action. Was this what I was going to keep on enduring?

No, not anymore. I was tired, tired of the insults and humiliation.

“I want a divorce,” I said. The words just came out.

Since he doesn't love me we can as well stop this hypocritical marriage.

Adrian raised an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. “Go ahead,” he said, not bothered at all.

My heart sank. I guess I expected him to beg me.

“But don’t forget who’s funding your parents’ company.”

His words hit me like a slap.

He continued voice like ice. “If you leave, Olivia, I will pull all the money I’ve put in. Let’s see how long they last without me.”

Tears blurred my vision. Without saying anything else, I turned and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind me.

I collapsed on the couch downstairs, the weight of it all crushing me. The betrayal, the humiliation, the fact that he didn't want to let me go – it was too much.

He said he didn't love me, but now I offered to leave his life and he still wouldn't let me.

I covered my face with my hands and let the tears fall, knowing no matter what he did, he still had the upper hand.

# CHAPTER 005

OLIVIA'S POV

I paced back and forth in my parent's living room, my fists clenched tightly, trying to control the overwhelming anger and hurt that swelled inside me.

My parents were sitting on the couch, looking at me as if I were the one in the wrong.

“Olivia, you have to understand,” my mother said, her voice calm and soothing like she always did when she was trying to manipulate me and make me do her bidding.

“Adrian’s investments in the company, the money, it’s all for the family. We can’t afford to lose that.”

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Was this really how they saw me? A tool to keep the business running?

After telling them what I was going through in that marriage and how I caught him cheating on me on our matrimonial bed without even feeling guilty about his actions after I caught him but instead threatened me.

This was what my biological mother could say to me.

I wanted to yell, but I didn’t. Instead, I clenched my jaw and spoke through gritted teeth. “What about me? What about my happiness?” My voice was barely a whisper, but the hurt was clear in every word.

My father shifted in his seat, avoiding my eyes. “You know how important the business is to this family, Olivia,” he said. “You need to put that first. Adrian’s not perfect, but… staying with him, it’s the only way forward.”

I couldn’t believe this. They weren’t even looking at the bigger picture, weren’t seeing how broken I was.

How every day with Adrian damaged my self-esteem, causing me emotional trauma.

“I’m not a business deal, Dad!” I snapped. “You’re telling me to sacrifice my life just so you can keep this empire afloat. What about me? What about my future?”

My mother’s expression hardened, and she stood up, walking over to me. “We’re trying to help you, Olivia,” she said, her tone now loud. “You have a responsibility to your family, to this company. Adrian’s your husband, whether you like it or not.”

I felt the tears welling up in my eyes. “I’m hurting Mom, I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’m not just some… accessory to this business. I'm your child – your blood”

My words hung in the air, but nothing changed. They were focused on the company, not me. I felt like I was suffocating.

I couldn’t take it anymore. With my heart racing, I stormed out of the house, slamming the door behind me. I needed to get away, to think, to know my next step.

I walked out onto the estate, trying to clear my head. I was so lost, so trapped. My feet took me further down the long driveway, my mind a whirlwind of confusion and anger.

That’s when I saw her.

Dora. 

The woman Adrian cheated on me with.

She was standing by the entrance to the estate like she’d been waiting for me. A smirk curled on her lips when she saw me.

What was she doing here? Was she also living here?

The White estate was quite expensive to afford. The apartment my parents lived in was bought by Adrian after we got married as a gift. I wondered how she could afford it, well I didn't know much about her.

Dora didn’t have to say anything, I could feel the challenge in the air between us.

I stopped in my tracks, feeling every nerve in my body tense. I didn’t have the energy for this, not now. But I knew she wasn’t going to make it easy for me.

“Olivia,” she said, her voice dripping with venom and a fake smile etched on her face. “I didn’t expect to see you out here. Is everything okay at home? Or are you just too embarrassed to face Adrian after all that happened?”

My heart raced at the mention of Adrian. I wanted to walk away, but her words felt like a slap in the face. I stood my ground, meeting her gaze. “What do you want?”

She stepped closer, her heels clicking on the pavement. “What do I want? Oh, nothing much. Just wanted to see if you were still playing the dutiful wife… making a fool out of yourself.”

I could feel the anger boiling up inside me. And I was tempted to slap her across the face, but I held back. “Don’t think you’re better than me,” I spat. “You’re just a pathetic little whore.”

Smack!

Her hands landed on my cheeks and I must admit it stung so bad. I also retaliated and slapped her too then started walking towards my car.

I was done trying to be gentle.

One minute I was walking to my car, the next I found myself falling face down, and I crashed to the pavement.

Dora pushed me.

Pain shot up my spine, and I gasped, but it was nothing compared to the sharp, burning pain in my abdomen.

I tried to lift myself, but something was wrong. I could feel the blood, the warmth spreading across my legs. My breath caught in my throat, panic flooding my senses and I could feel myself losing consciousness.

“Help me” I managed to whisper.

Dora stood there, her expression now more smug than ever, like she’d won some game.

“Oops… Guess you’re just too fragile for this,” she said, her tone mocking. But even her words seemed distant now. I could barely hear her.

Everything felt blurry like I was sinking. I didn’t know how long I lay there.

Then I heard someone shouting for help before I blacked out completely.

# CHAPTER 006

OLIVIA'S POV

Beep. Beep.

Those were the first sounds I heard as my consciousness slowly returned. My eyelids felt impossibly heavy, and every part of my body ached as if I had been run over by a truck. 

I blinked several times, my vision blurry and unfocused, trying to make sense of my surroundings. The harsh fluorescent lights above me were blinding, forcing me to shut my eyes momentarily before attempting to open them again.

I was in a hospital.

The scent of antiseptics and the faint humming of machines confirmed it before I could fully process my memories. Panic gripped me as flashes of what had happened resurfaced in my mind.

Dora.

I gasped softly, my fingers twitching against the cool sheets of the hospital bed. The memory of her smug expression, her taunting words, the pain that followed after she deliberately pushed me everything came crashing down at once. My breathing became shallow as fear and rage swirled in my chest.

A soft rustling sound drew my attention, and I sluggishly turned my head. A couple of nurses were standing near my bed, their expressions unreadable as they monitored the machines around me. One of them noticed my movement and immediately hurried out of the room, presumably to call the doctor.

I tried to sit up, but an intense wave of dizziness crashed over me, forcing me to fall back onto the pillows with a sharp exhale. My body felt weak, more exhausted than I had ever been in my life.

Moments later, the doctor walked in, his expression professional yet kind. He quickly checked my vitals, his brows furrowing slightly as he made notes on his clipboard. I wanted to speak, to ask what had happened to me, but my throat was dry, and my voice refused to come out.

“How are you feeling?” he asked, his tone calm and reassuring.

I tried to respond, but my lips barely moved. Seeing my struggle, he shook his head gently. “Relax. There’s no need to stress yourself. You’re still recovering, and your body needs rest.”

I swallowed dryly and rubbed my eyes with trembling fingers, still trying to sit up properly. I felt so disoriented, so lost. Something was nagging at the back of my mind – a deep, unsettling feeling that I was forgetting something crucial.

Then, the doctor continued speaking, explaining the extent of my injuries. My head was still spinning, making it difficult to fully grasp his words, but then I caught a sentence that sent ice shooting through my veins.

“I’m sorry, Miss, but you lost your baby.”

My eyes snapped open in shock. My heart stopped for a moment as my mind struggled to comprehend his words.

Baby?

I was pregnant?

And I lost it?

The words felt foreign, unreal like I had stepped into someone else’s nightmare.

“What…what did you just say?” I forced the words out, my voice barely above a whisper.

The doctor’s expression softened. “The little accident you were involved in caused you to lose your pregnancy. I’m truly sorry for your loss.”

I felt my heart clench, an unbearable weight pressing down on my chest. My hands instinctively moved to my abdomen, but there was nothing there – nothing but the dull ache of loss. 

My baby was gone. A child I hadn’t even known existed had been taken from me before I could even dream of its future.

Tears welled up in my eyes, blurring my vision as the reality of it all settled in. The walls of the hospital room seemed to close in on me, suffocating me. My breath hitched, and the machine beside me began to beep faster and faster as my heart rate spiked.

“Miss, you need to calm down,” the doctor urged his hands checking my pulse as the nurse adjusted the IV in my arm.

But how could I calm down? How could I just accept this?

The doctor continued speaking, but his voice faded into the background as my thoughts spiraled. My entire life had been a cycle of pain and disappointment. For three years, I had endured nothing but sorrow, and now this? How much more could the world take from me before it decided I had suffered enough?

I sobbed silently, gripping the sheets tightly, my body shaking as grief consumed me.

Then, another emotion began to take root, burning through my sorrow like fire consuming dry wood.

Rage.

Dora.

That witch had taken everything from me – my dignity, my pride, and now, my child. This wasn’t just an accident. It was her doing. She had done this to me, and she was going to pay.

Through my tears, I heard the doctor and the nurse discussing something a few feet away. I forced myself to listen despite the pounding in my head.

“Were you able to get in touch with any of her contacts?” the doctor asked the nurse.

“Yes, I called her husband and informed him,” the nurse responded.

There was a pause before the doctor spoke again. “So, he should be on his way then?”

The nurse hesitated, shifting uncomfortably. “Actually…he said he wasn’t coming.”

A bitter laugh almost escaped my lips.

Of course, Adrian wouldn’t come. What was I expecting? He had never cared about me. Why would he start now?

The doctor frowned. “Are you sure he said that?”

“Absolutely. Even I was shocked by his response. I honestly don’t know how he can leave his wife alone in a situation like this,” the nurse replied, her voice tinged with disbelief.

The doctor sighed. “Try reaching out to another one of her contacts perhaps her parents or a close friend.”

“Alright, sir,” the nurse responded, scrolling through my phone.

I shut my eyes, forcing myself to push past the fresh wave of pain. I knew my parents would show up. They had to. Despite our differences, they wouldn’t abandon me in a moment like this.

At least, that was what I hoped.

Eventually, exhaustion overtook my body, and I slipped into a restless sleep, my mind haunted by the loss I had suffered.

Hours later, I was woken by the sound of a familiar, deep voice beside me. My eyelids fluttered open, my vision still a bit blurry from sleep.

For a fleeting moment, I thought it was Adrian, that maybe just maybe he had decided to come after all. But as my vision cleared, I saw that it wasn’t him.

It was Julian.

My heart clenched at the sight of him. Julian, my best friend, the one person who had always been there for me no matter what. We had known each other since college, our bond unshaken despite the chaos Adrian had thrown our way in a bid to seperate our friendship.

He was sitting beside my bed, his sharp blue eyes filled with worry as he studied me.

“Liv,” he murmured, his voice softer than I’d ever heard it before. “Thank God you’re awake.”

Tears welled up in my eyes again, but this time, they weren’t just from pain.They were from relief.

Here are my experiences so far.

May 2, the second day of the challenge was the toughest. We took a friend to a birthday lunch and afterwards we tried a new coffee and dessert cafe. I got a milk coffee and explicitly asked for no sweetener. My friend ate an almond croissant right in front of me, which was the toughest thing I’ve been presented with so far.

Two days later we went to a friends house and knowing there were going to be sweets there, I made my own oatmeal cookies with banana the day before and brought those with me.

At work someone keeps a dish full of mini candy bars. In the past I would grab a couple of those for cheap energy. Or I’d grab a sweet drink somewhere.

Overall one benefit is that I’m not consuming as many empty calories. I also have been learning to make my own healthy alternatives. I’m also reading labels more and seeing how much sugar is added to the basic foods we buy.

I made my own cookies with no added sugar. I’ve also made my own granola using medjool dates and it is delicious.

OLIVIA'S POV

I lit the last candle, adjusting it slightly to balance the warm glow across the room. Soft music played in the background, and the bedside table was set with Adrian’s favorite wine.

Tonight had to be perfect.

I smoothed the silk lingerie which I had bought just for tonight with my trembling hands as I checked myself in the mirror one last time.

The sound of the door opening downstairs sent a chill down my spine. My heart raced.

Adrian was home.

I hurried to the edge of the bed, holding my cold hands together.

The door to the bedroom swung open, and there he was, he never ceases to take my breath away. His perfect angelic figure filled the doorway, his tie loose and suit wrinkled which was a rare sight for my always composed husband.

“What are you doing in my room?” His cold voice echoed in the room interrupting my thoughts.

I quickly stood up from the edge of the bed and my hands gripped a small portion of the fabric of my silk lingerie suddenly felt ridiculous in the outfit that I'd spent hours picking at the mall.

“I… I thought we could spend some time together,” I stammered.

His gaze swept across the room from the flickering candles, the soft music, the wine and finally landed on me.

His expression hardened and became darker causing me to shiver.

“I didn’t ask for an explanation,” he said coldly. “Blow out the candles and get out.”

I froze, his words hitting harder than they should have.

“Adrian,” I said quietly, forcing a smile that felt fragile. “It’s been a month since you’ve been home. Can’t we just talk for a moment?”

He let out a deep breath, rubbing his forehead as though I were an inconvenience. “I’m tired, Olivia. Don’t make this harder than it needs to be.”

“I’ve waited for you for one month!” My voice cracked, and I hated how desperate I sounded. “I thought…”

“I said I’m tired. Are you deaf?” His tone was final and harsh.

I bit back the lump in my throat.

I was in love and this is what love does, it makes you foolish. It makes you endure things you never thought you would.

You might ask me why I married him when I knew this was how he behaved towards me. It would shock you to know that Adrian wasn't always like this.

When we were dating, Adrian was sweet, thoughtful and caring. He made me believe I was the only woman meant for him and I fell for it. I agreed to marry him but the night we got married Adrian changed.

He became cold and distant, he even left me alone in the suites on our wedding night and went off to God knows where. I didn't see my husband until a week later.

No intimacy, no honeymoon, nothing!

I took a shaky breath and decided to try again. “Maybe I can help you relax just like the night before you travelled. We could…”

His dry, cold laugh cut me off. “Help me? Do you think I’d want to have anything to do with you? The last time was a drunken mistake.”

He shook his head. “Stop trying so hard, Olivia. It’s pathetic.”

Drunken mistake? Pathetic?

The words felt like a slap that stung so bad on my cheeks. My fists clenched at my sides as I fought back tears in my eyes.

“Is it pathetic to want my husband to care? To hope that after one month, you might want to be with me tonight?” My voice rose despite the lump in my throat.

He sneered, gesturing to the room. “This…” he waved a hand at the candles, the wine, the silk lingerie.

“This isn’t going to fix anything. It only makes me hate you more. Stop embarrassing yourself.”

My chest tightened. “Hate me?” I whispered, barely able to get the words out.

He sighed, glaring at me. “I think you should stop holding on to something that never existed.”

He once swore that he loved me and now he is saying nothing ever existed?

How could someone who used to love me so much turned into this cold heartless person? I just… I don't get it.

If he claims nothing ever existed between us why then did he marry me?

My chest ached, but I refused to let the tears welled up in my eyes fall.

“For three years you've been hurting my emotions time after time, and you act like you don’t care.”

Adrian scoffed. “Olivia, don’t get me wrong, I’m not acting. I actually don’t care. I never did, and I never will. Get that into your thick, empty skull. Do you understand?”

My breath caught in my throat as I stared at him in disbelief. How could he say such hurtful things to me?

“Then why did you ask for my hand in marriage?” I shouted, my voice shook. “Why marry me, Adrian? Why?”

Adrian’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t answer. Instead, he turned his back at me and headed toward the bathroom.

The door slammed shut behind him, leaving me alone with the flickering candles. Their warm light mocking the effort I had put into this night.

I sank onto the bed, I couldn't hold back the tears anymore as they streamed down my cheeks. My heart ached and I clutched my chest tightly hoping to relieve the pain.

Adrian’s phone buzzed on the nightstand bringing me back from my emotions.

Normally, I wouldn’t touch it. He was always so protective of it. But tonight, something compelled me. Maybe it was the pain, the betrayal, or the small voice in my head telling me not to mind my own business this time.

I picked up the phone, my hands trembled as I read the message.

Dora ❤️: “I enjoyed the vacation with you. Sweet dreams 💋.”

Vacation?

My heart stopped and I was unable to breathe properly for a while.

Adrian had told me he was on a business trip and I'd waited for him for one whole month only to discover that he was with another woman.

The phone slipped from my hands as the truth settled in my chest like a ton of blocks.

Adrian stepped out of the bathroom, a towel draped over his shoulders, I couldn't stop myself. “Who is Dora?”

# CHAPTER 002

OLIVIA'S POV

My body felt heavy as I woke up the next day, the events of last night came flooding back. Adrian’s cruel words echoed in my head like a noise I just couldn't get rid of.

Even after I confronted him about who Dora was he just snatched his phone and left the room without giving me any explanation, leaving me with a broken heart.

But I couldn't conclude yet, Adrian might not really be cheating on me, the text message wasn't enough evidence.

But one thing was certain, I was determined to find out who Dora was.

I sat up slowly, the ache in my chest sharper than ever. I reached for my phone and checked the time. It was 9:30 am.

My heart sank.

I was never one to wake up late, but I guess the emotional hurt I experienced the previous night had clearly drained me.

I gripped the edge of the bed to steady myself. “You're his wife,” I reminded myself. “You made vows. You can’t give up yet.”

I decided to make breakfast for Adrian. I deceived my brain into thinking that if I kept on trying Adrian would one day notice my efforts.

When I stepped into the kitchen, Martha, our housekeeper, was already there, humming softly as she whisked eggs in a bowl.

She looked up when she heard me enter. “Good morning, Mrs. Westwood,” she greeted politely, though concern flickered in her eyes. “You’re up late today. Should I prepare breakfast for you and Mr. Westwood?”

I shook my head. “No, Martha. I’ll handle it.”

Her brows furrowed. “Are you sure? I…”

“I just… I want to do this myself today.” I said softly, cutting her short with a faint smile.

She hesitated but eventually nodded. “All right, ma’am. I’ll be in the garden if you need me.”

I turned to the stove, cooked an omelet, toasted bread, and poured coffee. Maybe Adrian would appreciate the effort, maybe he would see I was trying.

When Adrian appeared, he was already dressed up for work, he didn't even glance at me. He sat at the table, scrolling through his phone as if I weren't there.

I approached cautiously, setting the plate in front of him. “Good morning,” I said, a small smile spread across my face. “I made breakfast.”

He didn’t look up, but his hand reached for the fork. I stood there, watching anxiously as he took a bite.

The moment the food touched his tongue, his expression twisted in disgust. He spat it out into a napkin, glaring at me.

“What is this?” he yelled, pushing the plate away.

“It’s…” My voice trembled. “I thought I’d make you breakfast.”

He stood, grabbing a glass of water and rinsing his mouth. “Don’t bother next time,” he said coldly. “If I wanted to die of food poisoning, I'd let you know.”

I bit my lower lips so hard in a bid to suppress the pain his words caused me.

After speaking, he grabbed his briefcase and strode toward the door without another word.

And I broke down in tears. My tears were the only thing that has been consistent in my marriage.

I heard a footstep approaching and I knew it was Martha. I quickly used the back of my hands to wipe off my tears.

I knew Martha was aware of the situation in my marriage but I still couldn't let her see me cry. I didn't want to receive pity from her, because that would hurt even more.

Martha wore a sympathetic look as she approached. “Mr. Westwood told me to inform you that you should be ready by 7 pm. He’ll pick you up for the gala.”

I nodded, numb. The gala. Of course. That must have been why he came home last night so that we could deceive the world into believing that we were a perfect couple.

It wasn't about me. It was never about me.

The thought crushed me, but I forced myself to remain calm.

By 6:45 pm, I was ready. Staring at myself in the mirror I noticed a slight change in my body but I shrugged it off.

I wore a white gown that hugged my figure. It was Adrian’s favorite color then when we were dating, though I doubted he’d notice it this evening.

When he arrived, he barely glanced at me. “Let’s go,” he said plainly, heading toward the car.

My heart dropped to my stomach, stupid of me to be expecting a compliment.

The ride to the gala was silent, the tension in the air was so thick that I felt suffocated. I was uncomfortable and feeling a bit nauseous.

I needed fresh air so I wound down the car window and stared out, clutching my bag tightly as I tried to calm the storm inside me.

When we arrived, cameras flashed, capturing the image of us as the world's perfect couple.

Adrian stepped out first, extending a hand to help me, acting like a perfect husband for the camera.

What a hypocrite he is!

Everyone never missed a chance to remind me of how lucky I was to marry Adrian.

Lol, only if they knew what I faced in my marriage every day. This is one of the reasons you shouldn't always envy couples who seem sweet on the internet.

Inside, the ballroom glittered with chandeliers and laughter, but I felt invisible. Adrian was the center of attention, charming the guests with his charisma while I trailed behind him like a shadow.

No one acknowledged me. No one asked how I was doing.

It was as if I didn’t exist.

I was about to excuse myself to the ladies’ room when a voice cut through the hum of conversation.

“Adrian!”

I turned toward the source of the voice. She was stunning, her red gown hugged her curves in all the right places. Her radiant smile lit the room and I must admit she looked like she had just stepped out of a magazine.

I won't lie, I felt slightly intimidated.

Adrian’s face lit up in a way I hadn’t seen in three years. “Dora,” he said, his tone warm, almost affectionate.

My breath ceased.

Dora? Could it be the Dora from the text message last night? The one he went on a vacation with?

My heart raced in my chest, I stared at them, my stomach churning.

Adrian didn’t even bother introducing me.

“Adrian,” I said softly, hoping to remind him of my existence.

But he ignored me completely and pretended as if he didn't hear me call out his name.

He leaned closer to Dora and whispered something in her ears, and she laughed, the sound caused a sharp pain in my chest.

She rested her hand on Adrian’s arm in a way that made my blood boil.

“You haven’t changed at all,” she teased. “Still so charming.”

“And you’re as beautiful as ever,” Adrian replied, his smile genuine – a smile I hadn’t seen or had even been directed at me in years.

It was as if a knife had been driven into my chest and was continuously being twisted as I watched them chat.

They chatted like lovers, her hand lingered on his arm, her gaze filled with something possessive.

I stood there, a ghost, as they flirted openly and I couldn't do anything about it. And it hurts.

Dora glanced at me, her lips curling into a sly smirk. “Oh, Adrian, I didn’t realize you had company.”

Huh… She didn't notice? Even a toddler would know I was his company.

I turned towards Adrian hoping to hear his response but his response was like a punch to my face.

“She’s just here for the gala, nothing more,” he said dismissively.

Just here for the gala?

Dora's smirk deepened. “Oh… well, Adrian. Since you don't have any company, why don't we find somewhere quiet to continue our discussion? It’s so noisy here.”

Adrian didn’t hesitate. “That sounds like a good idea.”

I couldn't believe my ears, was he going to leave me here alone?

No, he can't! He knows I don't know anyone here so he might ask me to join them.

Adrian turned to me briefly. “Book a ride home,” he said coldly.

I felt my heart shatter into a million pieces right at that spot.

And with that, he walked away, Dora's hand on his arm, leaving me standing there in the middle of the crowded room where I knew no one.

# CHAPTER 003

OLIVIA'S POV

Adrian didn’t come home that night and I wasn't comfortable since I knew he left with HER. I waited in bed, staring at the clock as hours passed. Midnight approached and still, there was no sign of him.

Was he spending the night with her? Was Adrian really cheating on me?

My chest felt hollow, the silence of the house taunting me. Sleep refused to come, so I sat up, hugging my knees, wondering if I’d ever truly mattered to him.

The next morning, I decided I couldn’t wait around in the house for him anymore. I needed to see him, to talk to him, to get to know who Dora was to him even if it meant facing his anger or indifference.

I didn't care anymore.

I told myself this was my right as his wife, even if he seemed to forget that fact.

I arrived at his office, my heart pounding as I approached the desk of his secretary, a chubby woman named Rita. She looked up from her computer, her expression neutral.

“Good morning, Mrs. Westwood,” she greeted politely, though her tone was quite different.

“I need to see Adrian,” I said, my voice calm despite the storm building inside me.

Rita hesitated, her fingers placed on her keyboard. “I’m sorry, ma’am, but Mr. Westwood has given strict instructions not to be disturbed.”

My cheeks flushed with embarrassment. I could feel the humiliation crawling up my spine. She knew I was his wife, yet she still denied me entry.

This is the humiliation I constantly have to endure ever since I married Adrian.

“Please,” I said, lowering my voice. “It’s important.”

Her lips pressed into a thin line. “I’m afraid I can’t, ma’am. Mr. Westwood doesn’t want to see anyone right now.”

Before I could respond, the door to Adrian’s office swung open. My breathing stopped for a moment as I saw him step out, his deep laugh filling the hallway.

He wasn’t alone.

Walking beside him was Dora, her heels clicking confidently against the marble floor.

What was she doing here?

Adrian’s expression was the same as hers – light, carefree, so unlike the cold mask he wore around me.

I remain rooted to my spot, unsure whether to stay or walk away. They were lost in conversation, their voices low but filled with warmth. I wondered if they saw me or were pretending not to have.

When they reached the lobby, Adrian turned to Dora with a smile. “I’ll see you later,” he said, his tone easy and familiar like how he talked to me before our marriage.

Dora leaned closer, brushing a hand against his arm. “Don’t forget about our plans.”

What plans?

He nodded, his smile unwavering.

As she walked off, her eyes darted to me for a brief moment, her lips curving into a knowing smirk before she disappeared into the elevator.

My hands clenched into fists, my knuckles turning white. Adrian turned to head back into his office, but I stepped forward, blocking his path.

“Adrian,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

He stopped, his gaze cold as it settled on me.

“What are you doing here?” he asked, his tone devoid of any emotion.

“I came to talk,” I replied, fighting the anger in my voice. “Why didn't you come…”

“Not now,” he cut me off, signaling to Rita with his hand. “Make sure no one disturbs me.”

Rita stepped forward, her presence creating a distance between us.

“But…” I started, only for him to turn and walk back into his office, the door clicking shut behind him.

The humiliation burned like fire in my chest. I didn’t argue further. I couldn't keep on embarrassing myself there was no point. I made my way to the car garage.

My marriage was supposed to be my shield, my safe place, but here, it was nothing more than a badge of shame.

In the dimly lit garage, I spotted Dora standing by her car, her posture relaxed as she waited. When our eyes met, her smirk returned, sharper this time.

“You look upset,” she said, her tone dripping with mock concern. “Rough day?”

I ignored her, walking to my car, but she stepped in front of me, blocking my path.

“You know, Olivia,” she began, her voice sweet but laced with venom, “you really shouldn’t cling to a man who clearly doesn’t want you. It’s… sad and pathetic.”

I told myself to calm down, I refused to let her see my pain. “Is there something you want?” I asked, keeping my tone as steady as I could.

She laughed, a sound that made my chest tighten. “I just thought I’d give you some girly advice.”

I clenched my fists, biting back the urge to lash out. “Are you done?” I asked, but didn't wait for her response.

As I opened my car door, her parting words reached me. “You’re fighting a losing battle, Olivia. You should know when to quit.”

I drove home in silence, her words settling over me like a dark cloud.

That night, Adrian didn’t come home early which had become a routine ever since he came back from his supposed business trip.

And I knew it was because of Dora.

Curiosity got the best of me, and I found myself walking toward the one place Adrian had forbidden me to enter – his study.

I had a strong feeling that I might find something there that would reveal more about Dora and her relationship with Adrian.

I hesitated in front of the door, my pulse racing, but Dora’s smug smile flashed in my mind and I found myself breaking the rules I hadn't broken in three years.

While going through his drawers, I stumbled upon an old, slightly worn-out photograph that made my heartbeat slow and froze me in place.

It was a picture of young Adrian, a pretty woman holding him close, whom I assumed to be his mother because of the resemblance, and my parents, all smiling at the camera.

Everything in me screamed confusion. Why were they together? How was this possible?

My parents never seemed to know Adrian when I first introduced him to them, and even Adrian never mentioned knowing my parents.

My head was filled with different questions, each one adding to the headache that was starting to build.

Why hadn’t Adrian mentioned knowing my parents? Was he hiding something from me? Or was there something my parents had kept from me?

I was snapped back to reality when I heard the door click open downstairs. My heart leaped, and I quickly shoved the photograph back into the drawer, my hands trembling as I hurried back to the bedroom.

Adrian walked in without a word, and the room was filled with the stench of alcohol. I stood awkwardly by the bed, unsure whether to speak or remain silent.

Without warning, he closed the distance between us, his hands gripped my waist.

I hated the way my heart leaped, I knew I should have pushed him, yelled at him, or better still slapped him but I found myself yearning for more.

My heart thumped faster as he kissed me, his movements hungry like a lion that had been starved for days.

“Adrian,” I whispered, but he silenced me, pulling me closer and undressing me.

I knew I shouldn't enjoy it but I did.

That night, he touched me for the second time in three years.

I remembered the first time we were intimate a month ago he was drunk and tonight he was also drunk.

I knew what it meant but I deceived my mind into thinking that it was a hope that things might get better.

The next morning, Adrian acted as if nothing had happened. He stood by the dresser, buttoning his shirt while I lay in bed, watching him.

“Good morning,” I greeted, a blush creeping up my cheeks.

He didn’t respond, his focus was on his tie.

“Adrian,” I said softly, sitting up. “About last night…”

He turned to me, his expression cold. “What about it?”

I hesitated, unsure how to interpret his tone. “I… I just thought…”

“Don’t overthink it,” he interrupted. “I sent some money to your account. Consider it payment for your services.”

His words hit me like a punch to the gut. My lips parted, but no sound came out.

Without another glance, he grabbed his briefcase and left, leaving me sitting there in stunned silence.

Tears blurred my vision as I clutched the sheets, my heart bleeding.

Was this what I had become? A service to be paid for?

# CHAPTER 004

OLIVIA'S POV

I gripped the steering wheel, my hands tight as I drove. I had no destination in mind I just needed to leave the house that constantly reminded me of my failing marriage and emotionally unavailable husband.

The words Adrian had said that morning kept playing in my head, no matter how much I tried to distract myself.

My chest hurt, and I wanted to scream. Three years of marriage, and yet, I was just something he could use. I didn’t know where I was going. I just needed to get away.

Eventually, hours later, I drove back home. I parked in the driveway but stayed in the car for a minute, taking deep breaths. My eyes were still red from crying, and everything felt heavy inside me.

When I finally walked inside, the first thing I saw was a pair of red heels by the door. They weren’t mine. My stomach dropped, and panic rushed in.

I took a deep breath and started walking upstairs. With every step, my heart beat faster. I wanted to turn around and run, but something inside me kept going forward, pushing me to face whatever was waiting.

When I reached the bedroom door, I hesitated. My hand gripped the handle for a while. But I pushed it open anyway.

What I saw froze me.

Dora was lying on the bed, half-dressed, her gown slipping off her shoulder. Adrian was next to her, still in his shirt and pants, fast asleep.

My stomach twisted. I felt like I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think. For a second, I just stood there, staring at them, still not believing my eyes.

Adrian cheating on me was something I could overlook because of love but what I could never take was him bringing his mistress to our home on our matrimonial bed.

That was a disrespect I could never tolerate.

“Adrian!” I shouted, my voice echoing in the room.

Adrian’s eyes fluttered open. He blinked and then looked at me.

A look of confusion crossed his face as he glanced over at Dora who was lying next to him but in a blink of an eye, his face went from that to something colder, more distant.

“Olivia,” he said, voice groggy. He rubbed his eyes like he was just waking from a nap.

I wanted to scream, but I kept my fists clenched and stared at him, waiting for an explanation. Then Dora moved beside him, stretching and smiling at me.

“Oh, Olivia,” she said sweetly, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “You’re home early.”

Her smile, her tone – it made everything worse.

“What is this… Adrian?” I asked, my voice breaking.

He sighed and ran a hand through his hair, looking tired. “Calm down, Olivia,” he said like it was my fault.

“Calm down?” I repeated, my voice getting louder. “You brought her into our matrimonial bed, and now you want me to calm down?”

Dora laughed softly, wrapping the blanket around herself like she was perfectly at ease. “Oh, darling,” she said, her eyes sharp, “don’t make a scene.”

Her words made me sick, but I refused to let her see me lose control. I turned to Adrian. “You don’t even care enough to deny it?”

He looked at me with no emotion, then shrugged. “There’s nothing to deny,” he said, his voice cold.

That hit me like a punch. I felt weak, but I forced myself to stay standing.

He wasn't even remorseful of his action. Was this what I was going to keep on enduring?

No, not anymore. I was tired, tired of the insults and humiliation.

“I want a divorce,” I said. The words just came out.

Since he doesn't love me we can as well stop this hypocritical marriage.

Adrian raised an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. “Go ahead,” he said, not bothered at all.

My heart sank. I guess I expected him to beg me.

“But don’t forget who’s funding your parents’ company.”

His words hit me like a slap.

He continued voice like ice. “If you leave, Olivia, I will pull all the money I’ve put in. Let’s see how long they last without me.”

Tears blurred my vision. Without saying anything else, I turned and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind me.

I collapsed on the couch downstairs, the weight of it all crushing me. The betrayal, the humiliation, the fact that he didn't want to let me go – it was too much.

He said he didn't love me, but now I offered to leave his life and he still wouldn't let me.

I covered my face with my hands and let the tears fall, knowing no matter what he did, he still had the upper hand.

# CHAPTER 005

OLIVIA'S POV

I paced back and forth in my parent's living room, my fists clenched tightly, trying to control the overwhelming anger and hurt that swelled inside me.

My parents were sitting on the couch, looking at me as if I were the one in the wrong.

“Olivia, you have to understand,” my mother said, her voice calm and soothing like she always did when she was trying to manipulate me and make me do her bidding.

“Adrian’s investments in the company, the money, it’s all for the family. We can’t afford to lose that.”

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Was this really how they saw me? A tool to keep the business running?

After telling them what I was going through in that marriage and how I caught him cheating on me on our matrimonial bed without even feeling guilty about his actions after I caught him but instead threatened me.

This was what my biological mother could say to me.

I wanted to yell, but I didn’t. Instead, I clenched my jaw and spoke through gritted teeth. “What about me? What about my happiness?” My voice was barely a whisper, but the hurt was clear in every word.

My father shifted in his seat, avoiding my eyes. “You know how important the business is to this family, Olivia,” he said. “You need to put that first. Adrian’s not perfect, but… staying with him, it’s the only way forward.”

I couldn’t believe this. They weren’t even looking at the bigger picture, weren’t seeing how broken I was.

How every day with Adrian damaged my self-esteem, causing me emotional trauma.

“I’m not a business deal, Dad!” I snapped. “You’re telling me to sacrifice my life just so you can keep this empire afloat. What about me? What about my future?”

My mother’s expression hardened, and she stood up, walking over to me. “We’re trying to help you, Olivia,” she said, her tone now loud. “You have a responsibility to your family, to this company. Adrian’s your husband, whether you like it or not.”

I felt the tears welling up in my eyes. “I’m hurting Mom, I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’m not just some… accessory to this business. I'm your child – your blood”

My words hung in the air, but nothing changed. They were focused on the company, not me. I felt like I was suffocating.

I couldn’t take it anymore. With my heart racing, I stormed out of the house, slamming the door behind me. I needed to get away, to think, to know my next step.

I walked out onto the estate, trying to clear my head. I was so lost, so trapped. My feet took me further down the long driveway, my mind a whirlwind of confusion and anger.

That’s when I saw her.

Dora. 

The woman Adrian cheated on me with.

She was standing by the entrance to the estate like she’d been waiting for me. A smirk curled on her lips when she saw me.

What was she doing here? Was she also living here?

The White estate was quite expensive to afford. The apartment my parents lived in was bought by Adrian after we got married as a gift. I wondered how she could afford it, well I didn't know much about her.

Dora didn’t have to say anything, I could feel the challenge in the air between us.

I stopped in my tracks, feeling every nerve in my body tense. I didn’t have the energy for this, not now. But I knew she wasn’t going to make it easy for me.

“Olivia,” she said, her voice dripping with venom and a fake smile etched on her face. “I didn’t expect to see you out here. Is everything okay at home? Or are you just too embarrassed to face Adrian after all that happened?”

My heart raced at the mention of Adrian. I wanted to walk away, but her words felt like a slap in the face. I stood my ground, meeting her gaze. “What do you want?”

She stepped closer, her heels clicking on the pavement. “What do I want? Oh, nothing much. Just wanted to see if you were still playing the dutiful wife… making a fool out of yourself.”

I could feel the anger boiling up inside me. And I was tempted to slap her across the face, but I held back. “Don’t think you’re better than me,” I spat. “You’re just a pathetic little whore.”

Smack!

Her hands landed on my cheeks and I must admit it stung so bad. I also retaliated and slapped her too then started walking towards my car.

I was done trying to be gentle.

One minute I was walking to my car, the next I found myself falling face down, and I crashed to the pavement.

Dora pushed me.

Pain shot up my spine, and I gasped, but it was nothing compared to the sharp, burning pain in my abdomen.

I tried to lift myself, but something was wrong. I could feel the blood, the warmth spreading across my legs. My breath caught in my throat, panic flooding my senses and I could feel myself losing consciousness.

“Help me” I managed to whisper.

Dora stood there, her expression now more smug than ever, like she’d won some game.

“Oops… Guess you’re just too fragile for this,” she said, her tone mocking. But even her words seemed distant now. I could barely hear her.

Everything felt blurry like I was sinking. I didn’t know how long I lay there.

Then I heard someone shouting for help before I blacked out completely.

# CHAPTER 006

OLIVIA'S POV

Beep. Beep.

Those were the first sounds I heard as my consciousness slowly returned. My eyelids felt impossibly heavy, and every part of my body ached as if I had been run over by a truck. 

I blinked several times, my vision blurry and unfocused, trying to make sense of my surroundings. The harsh fluorescent lights above me were blinding, forcing me to shut my eyes momentarily before attempting to open them again.

I was in a hospital.

The scent of antiseptics and the faint humming of machines confirmed it before I could fully process my memories. Panic gripped me as flashes of what had happened resurfaced in my mind.

Dora.

I gasped softly, my fingers twitching against the cool sheets of the hospital bed. The memory of her smug expression, her taunting words, the pain that followed after she deliberately pushed me everything came crashing down at once. My breathing became shallow as fear and rage swirled in my chest.

A soft rustling sound drew my attention, and I sluggishly turned my head. A couple of nurses were standing near my bed, their expressions unreadable as they monitored the machines around me. One of them noticed my movement and immediately hurried out of the room, presumably to call the doctor.

I tried to sit up, but an intense wave of dizziness crashed over me, forcing me to fall back onto the pillows with a sharp exhale. My body felt weak, more exhausted than I had ever been in my life.

Moments later, the doctor walked in, his expression professional yet kind. He quickly checked my vitals, his brows furrowing slightly as he made notes on his clipboard. I wanted to speak, to ask what had happened to me, but my throat was dry, and my voice refused to come out.

“How are you feeling?” he asked, his tone calm and reassuring.

I tried to respond, but my lips barely moved. Seeing my struggle, he shook his head gently. “Relax. There’s no need to stress yourself. You’re still recovering, and your body needs rest.”

I swallowed dryly and rubbed my eyes with trembling fingers, still trying to sit up properly. I felt so disoriented, so lost. Something was nagging at the back of my mind – a deep, unsettling feeling that I was forgetting something crucial.

Then, the doctor continued speaking, explaining the extent of my injuries. My head was still spinning, making it difficult to fully grasp his words, but then I caught a sentence that sent ice shooting through my veins.

“I’m sorry, Miss, but you lost your baby.”

My eyes snapped open in shock. My heart stopped for a moment as my mind struggled to comprehend his words.

Baby?

I was pregnant?

And I lost it?

The words felt foreign, unreal like I had stepped into someone else’s nightmare.

“What…what did you just say?” I forced the words out, my voice barely above a whisper.

The doctor’s expression softened. “The little accident you were involved in caused you to lose your pregnancy. I’m truly sorry for your loss.”

I felt my heart clench, an unbearable weight pressing down on my chest. My hands instinctively moved to my abdomen, but there was nothing there – nothing but the dull ache of loss. 

My baby was gone. A child I hadn’t even known existed had been taken from me before I could even dream of its future.

Tears welled up in my eyes, blurring my vision as the reality of it all settled in. The walls of the hospital room seemed to close in on me, suffocating me. My breath hitched, and the machine beside me began to beep faster and faster as my heart rate spiked.

“Miss, you need to calm down,” the doctor urged his hands checking my pulse as the nurse adjusted the IV in my arm.

But how could I calm down? How could I just accept this?

The doctor continued speaking, but his voice faded into the background as my thoughts spiraled. My entire life had been a cycle of pain and disappointment. For three years, I had endured nothing but sorrow, and now this? How much more could the world take from me before it decided I had suffered enough?

I sobbed silently, gripping the sheets tightly, my body shaking as grief consumed me.

Then, another emotion began to take root, burning through my sorrow like fire consuming dry wood.

Rage.

Dora.

That witch had taken everything from me – my dignity, my pride, and now, my child. This wasn’t just an accident. It was her doing. She had done this to me, and she was going to pay.

Through my tears, I heard the doctor and the nurse discussing something a few feet away. I forced myself to listen despite the pounding in my head.

“Were you able to get in touch with any of her contacts?” the doctor asked the nurse.

“Yes, I called her husband and informed him,” the nurse responded.

There was a pause before the doctor spoke again. “So, he should be on his way then?”

The nurse hesitated, shifting uncomfortably. “Actually…he said he wasn’t coming.”

A bitter laugh almost escaped my lips.

Of course, Adrian wouldn’t come. What was I expecting? He had never cared about me. Why would he start now?

The doctor frowned. “Are you sure he said that?”

“Absolutely. Even I was shocked by his response. I honestly don’t know how he can leave his wife alone in a situation like this,” the nurse replied, her voice tinged with disbelief.

The doctor sighed. “Try reaching out to another one of her contacts perhaps her parents or a close friend.”

“Alright, sir,” the nurse responded, scrolling through my phone.

I shut my eyes, forcing myself to push past the fresh wave of pain. I knew my parents would show up. They had to. Despite our differences, they wouldn’t abandon me in a moment like this.

At least, that was what I hoped.

Eventually, exhaustion overtook my body, and I slipped into a restless sleep, my mind haunted by the loss I had suffered.

Hours later, I was woken by the sound of a familiar, deep voice beside me. My eyelids fluttered open, my vision still a bit blurry from sleep.

For a fleeting moment, I thought it was Adrian, that maybe just maybe he had decided to come after all. But as my vision cleared, I saw that it wasn’t him.

It was Julian.

My heart clenched at the sight of him. Julian, my best friend, the one person who had always been there for me no matter what. We had known each other since college, our bond unshaken despite the chaos Adrian had thrown our way in a bid to seperate our friendship.

He was sitting beside my bed, his sharp blue eyes filled with worry as he studied me.

“Liv,” he murmured, his voice softer than I’d ever heard it before. “Thank God you’re awake.”

OLIVIA'S POV

I lit the last candle, adjusting it slightly to balance the warm glow across the room. Soft music played in the background, and the bedside table was set with Adrian’s favorite wine.

Tonight had to be perfect.

I smoothed the silk lingerie which I had bought just for tonight with my trembling hands as I checked myself in the mirror one last time.

The sound of the door opening downstairs sent a chill down my spine. My heart raced.

Adrian was home.

I hurried to the edge of the bed, holding my cold hands together.

The door to the bedroom swung open, and there he was, he never ceases to take my breath away. His perfect angelic figure filled the doorway, his tie loose and suit wrinkled which was a rare sight for my always composed husband.

“What are you doing in my room?” His cold voice echoed in the room interrupting my thoughts.

I quickly stood up from the edge of the bed and my hands gripped a small portion of the fabric of my silk lingerie suddenly felt ridiculous in the outfit that I'd spent hours picking at the mall.

“I… I thought we could spend some time together,” I stammered.

His gaze swept across the room from the flickering candles, the soft music, the wine and finally landed on me.

His expression hardened and became darker causing me to shiver.

“I didn’t ask for an explanation,” he said coldly. “Blow out the candles and get out.”

I froze, his words hitting harder than they should have.

“Adrian,” I said quietly, forcing a smile that felt fragile. “It’s been a month since you’ve been home. Can’t we just talk for a moment?”

He let out a deep breath, rubbing his forehead as though I were an inconvenience. “I’m tired, Olivia. Don’t make this harder than it needs to be.”

“I’ve waited for you for one month!” My voice cracked, and I hated how desperate I sounded. “I thought…”

“I said I’m tired. Are you deaf?” His tone was final and harsh.

I bit back the lump in my throat.

I was in love and this is what love does, it makes you foolish. It makes you endure things you never thought you would.

You might ask me why I married him when I knew this was how he behaved towards me. It would shock you to know that Adrian wasn't always like this.

When we were dating, Adrian was sweet, thoughtful and caring. He made me believe I was the only woman meant for him and I fell for it. I agreed to marry him but the night we got married Adrian changed.

He became cold and distant, he even left me alone in the suites on our wedding night and went off to God knows where. I didn't see my husband until a week later.

No intimacy, no honeymoon, nothing!

I took a shaky breath and decided to try again. “Maybe I can help you relax just like the night before you travelled. We could…”

His dry, cold laugh cut me off. “Help me? Do you think I’d want to have anything to do with you? The last time was a drunken mistake.”

He shook his head. “Stop trying so hard, Olivia. It’s pathetic.”

Drunken mistake? Pathetic?

The words felt like a slap that stung so bad on my cheeks. My fists clenched at my sides as I fought back tears in my eyes.

“Is it pathetic to want my husband to care? To hope that after one month, you might want to be with me tonight?” My voice rose despite the lump in my throat.

He sneered, gesturing to the room. “This…” he waved a hand at the candles, the wine, the silk lingerie.

“This isn’t going to fix anything. It only makes me hate you more. Stop embarrassing yourself.”

My chest tightened. “Hate me?” I whispered, barely able to get the words out.

He sighed, glaring at me. “I think you should stop holding on to something that never existed.”

He once swore that he loved me and now he is saying nothing ever existed?

How could someone who used to love me so much turned into this cold heartless person? I just… I don't get it.

If he claims nothing ever existed between us why then did he marry me?

My chest ached, but I refused to let the tears welled up in my eyes fall.

“For three years you've been hurting my emotions time after time, and you act like you don’t care.”

Adrian scoffed. “Olivia, don’t get me wrong, I’m not acting. I actually don’t care. I never did, and I never will. Get that into your thick, empty skull. Do you understand?”

My breath caught in my throat as I stared at him in disbelief. How could he say such hurtful things to me?

“Then why did you ask for my hand in marriage?” I shouted, my voice shook. “Why marry me, Adrian? Why?”

Adrian’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t answer. Instead, he turned his back at me and headed toward the bathroom.

The door slammed shut behind him, leaving me alone with the flickering candles. Their warm light mocking the effort I had put into this night.

I sank onto the bed, I couldn't hold back the tears anymore as they streamed down my cheeks. My heart ached and I clutched my chest tightly hoping to relieve the pain.

Adrian’s phone buzzed on the nightstand bringing me back from my emotions.

Normally, I wouldn’t touch it. He was always so protective of it. But tonight, something compelled me. Maybe it was the pain, the betrayal, or the small voice in my head telling me not to mind my own business this time.

I picked up the phone, my hands trembled as I read the message.

Dora ❤️: “I enjoyed the vacation with you. Sweet dreams 💋.”

Vacation?

My heart stopped and I was unable to breathe properly for a while.

Adrian had told me he was on a business trip and I'd waited for him for one whole month only to discover that he was with another woman.

The phone slipped from my hands as the truth settled in my chest like a ton of blocks.

Adrian stepped out of the bathroom, a towel draped over his shoulders, I couldn't stop myself. “Who is Dora?”

# CHAPTER 002

OLIVIA'S POV

My body felt heavy as I woke up the next day, the events of last night came flooding back. Adrian’s cruel words echoed in my head like a noise I just couldn't get rid of.

Even after I confronted him about who Dora was he just snatched his phone and left the room without giving me any explanation, leaving me with a broken heart.

But I couldn't conclude yet, Adrian might not really be cheating on me, the text message wasn't enough evidence.

But one thing was certain, I was determined to find out who Dora was.

I sat up slowly, the ache in my chest sharper than ever. I reached for my phone and checked the time. It was 9:30 am.

My heart sank.

I was never one to wake up late, but I guess the emotional hurt I experienced the previous night had clearly drained me.

I gripped the edge of the bed to steady myself. “You're his wife,” I reminded myself. “You made vows. You can’t give up yet.”

I decided to make breakfast for Adrian. I deceived my brain into thinking that if I kept on trying Adrian would one day notice my efforts.

When I stepped into the kitchen, Martha, our housekeeper, was already there, humming softly as she whisked eggs in a bowl.

She looked up when she heard me enter. “Good morning, Mrs. Westwood,” she greeted politely, though concern flickered in her eyes. “You’re up late today. Should I prepare breakfast for you and Mr. Westwood?”

I shook my head. “No, Martha. I’ll handle it.”

Her brows furrowed. “Are you sure? I…”

“I just… I want to do this myself today.” I said softly, cutting her short with a faint smile.

She hesitated but eventually nodded. “All right, ma’am. I’ll be in the garden if you need me.”

I turned to the stove, cooked an omelet, toasted bread, and poured coffee. Maybe Adrian would appreciate the effort, maybe he would see I was trying.

When Adrian appeared, he was already dressed up for work, he didn't even glance at me. He sat at the table, scrolling through his phone as if I weren't there.

I approached cautiously, setting the plate in front of him. “Good morning,” I said, a small smile spread across my face. “I made breakfast.”

He didn’t look up, but his hand reached for the fork. I stood there, watching anxiously as he took a bite.

The moment the food touched his tongue, his expression twisted in disgust. He spat it out into a napkin, glaring at me.

“What is this?” he yelled, pushing the plate away.

“It’s…” My voice trembled. “I thought I’d make you breakfast.”

He stood, grabbing a glass of water and rinsing his mouth. “Don’t bother next time,” he said coldly. “If I wanted to die of food poisoning, I'd let you know.”

I bit my lower lips so hard in a bid to suppress the pain his words caused me.

After speaking, he grabbed his briefcase and strode toward the door without another word.

And I broke down in tears. My tears were the only thing that has been consistent in my marriage.

I heard a footstep approaching and I knew it was Martha. I quickly used the back of my hands to wipe off my tears.

I knew Martha was aware of the situation in my marriage but I still couldn't let her see me cry. I didn't want to receive pity from her, because that would hurt even more.

Martha wore a sympathetic look as she approached. “Mr. Westwood told me to inform you that you should be ready by 7 pm. He’ll pick you up for the gala.”

I nodded, numb. The gala. Of course. That must have been why he came home last night so that we could deceive the world into believing that we were a perfect couple.

It wasn't about me. It was never about me.

The thought crushed me, but I forced myself to remain calm.

By 6:45 pm, I was ready. Staring at myself in the mirror I noticed a slight change in my body but I shrugged it off.

I wore a white gown that hugged my figure. It was Adrian’s favorite color then when we were dating, though I doubted he’d notice it this evening.

When he arrived, he barely glanced at me. “Let’s go,” he said plainly, heading toward the car.

My heart dropped to my stomach, stupid of me to be expecting a compliment.

The ride to the gala was silent, the tension in the air was so thick that I felt suffocated. I was uncomfortable and feeling a bit nauseous.

I needed fresh air so I wound down the car window and stared out, clutching my bag tightly as I tried to calm the storm inside me.

When we arrived, cameras flashed, capturing the image of us as the world's perfect couple.

Adrian stepped out first, extending a hand to help me, acting like a perfect husband for the camera.

What a hypocrite he is!

Everyone never missed a chance to remind me of how lucky I was to marry Adrian.

Lol, only if they knew what I faced in my marriage every day. This is one of the reasons you shouldn't always envy couples who seem sweet on the internet.

Inside, the ballroom glittered with chandeliers and laughter, but I felt invisible. Adrian was the center of attention, charming the guests with his charisma while I trailed behind him like a shadow.

No one acknowledged me. No one asked how I was doing.

It was as if I didn’t exist.

I was about to excuse myself to the ladies’ room when a voice cut through the hum of conversation.

“Adrian!”

I turned toward the source of the voice. She was stunning, her red gown hugged her curves in all the right places. Her radiant smile lit the room and I must admit she looked like she had just stepped out of a magazine.

I won't lie, I felt slightly intimidated.

Adrian’s face lit up in a way I hadn’t seen in three years. “Dora,” he said, his tone warm, almost affectionate.

My breath ceased.

Dora? Could it be the Dora from the text message last night? The one he went on a vacation with?

My heart raced in my chest, I stared at them, my stomach churning.

Adrian didn’t even bother introducing me.

“Adrian,” I said softly, hoping to remind him of my existence.

But he ignored me completely and pretended as if he didn't hear me call out his name.

He leaned closer to Dora and whispered something in her ears, and she laughed, the sound caused a sharp pain in my chest.

She rested her hand on Adrian’s arm in a way that made my blood boil.

“You haven’t changed at all,” she teased. “Still so charming.”

“And you’re as beautiful as ever,” Adrian replied, his smile genuine – a smile I hadn’t seen or had even been directed at me in years.

It was as if a knife had been driven into my chest and was continuously being twisted as I watched them chat.

They chatted like lovers, her hand lingered on his arm, her gaze filled with something possessive.

I stood there, a ghost, as they flirted openly and I couldn't do anything about it. And it hurts.

Dora glanced at me, her lips curling into a sly smirk. “Oh, Adrian, I didn’t realize you had company.”

Huh… She didn't notice? Even a toddler would know I was his company.

I turned towards Adrian hoping to hear his response but his response was like a punch to my face.

“She’s just here for the gala, nothing more,” he said dismissively.

Just here for the gala?

Dora's smirk deepened. “Oh… well, Adrian. Since you don't have any company, why don't we find somewhere quiet to continue our discussion? It’s so noisy here.”

Adrian didn’t hesitate. “That sounds like a good idea.”

I couldn't believe my ears, was he going to leave me here alone?

No, he can't! He knows I don't know anyone here so he might ask me to join them.

Adrian turned to me briefly. “Book a ride home,” he said coldly.

I felt my heart shatter into a million pieces right at that spot.

And with that, he walked away, Dora's hand on his arm, leaving me standing there in the middle of the crowded room where I knew no one.

# CHAPTER 003

OLIVIA'S POV

Adrian didn’t come home that night and I wasn't comfortable since I knew he left with HER. I waited in bed, staring at the clock as hours passed. Midnight approached and still, there was no sign of him.

Was he spending the night with her? Was Adrian really cheating on me?

My chest felt hollow, the silence of the house taunting me. Sleep refused to come, so I sat up, hugging my knees, wondering if I’d ever truly mattered to him.

The next morning, I decided I couldn’t wait around in the house for him anymore. I needed to see him, to talk to him, to get to know who Dora was to him even if it meant facing his anger or indifference.

I didn't care anymore.

I told myself this was my right as his wife, even if he seemed to forget that fact.

I arrived at his office, my heart pounding as I approached the desk of his secretary, a chubby woman named Rita. She looked up from her computer, her expression neutral.

“Good morning, Mrs. Westwood,” she greeted politely, though her tone was quite different.

“I need to see Adrian,” I said, my voice calm despite the storm building inside me.

Rita hesitated, her fingers placed on her keyboard. “I’m sorry, ma’am, but Mr. Westwood has given strict instructions not to be disturbed.”

My cheeks flushed with embarrassment. I could feel the humiliation crawling up my spine. She knew I was his wife, yet she still denied me entry.

This is the humiliation I constantly have to endure ever since I married Adrian.

“Please,” I said, lowering my voice. “It’s important.”

Her lips pressed into a thin line. “I’m afraid I can’t, ma’am. Mr. Westwood doesn’t want to see anyone right now.”

Before I could respond, the door to Adrian’s office swung open. My breathing stopped for a moment as I saw him step out, his deep laugh filling the hallway.

He wasn’t alone.

Walking beside him was Dora, her heels clicking confidently against the marble floor.

What was she doing here?

Adrian’s expression was the same as hers – light, carefree, so unlike the cold mask he wore around me.

I remain rooted to my spot, unsure whether to stay or walk away. They were lost in conversation, their voices low but filled with warmth. I wondered if they saw me or were pretending not to have.

When they reached the lobby, Adrian turned to Dora with a smile. “I’ll see you later,” he said, his tone easy and familiar like how he talked to me before our marriage.

Dora leaned closer, brushing a hand against his arm. “Don’t forget about our plans.”

What plans?

He nodded, his smile unwavering.

As she walked off, her eyes darted to me for a brief moment, her lips curving into a knowing smirk before she disappeared into the elevator.

My hands clenched into fists, my knuckles turning white. Adrian turned to head back into his office, but I stepped forward, blocking his path.

“Adrian,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

He stopped, his gaze cold as it settled on me.

“What are you doing here?” he asked, his tone devoid of any emotion.

“I came to talk,” I replied, fighting the anger in my voice. “Why didn't you come…”

“Not now,” he cut me off, signaling to Rita with his hand. “Make sure no one disturbs me.”

Rita stepped forward, her presence creating a distance between us.

“But…” I started, only for him to turn and walk back into his office, the door clicking shut behind him.

The humiliation burned like fire in my chest. I didn’t argue further. I couldn't keep on embarrassing myself there was no point. I made my way to the car garage.

My marriage was supposed to be my shield, my safe place, but here, it was nothing more than a badge of shame.

In the dimly lit garage, I spotted Dora standing by her car, her posture relaxed as she waited. When our eyes met, her smirk returned, sharper this time.

“You look upset,” she said, her tone dripping with mock concern. “Rough day?”

I ignored her, walking to my car, but she stepped in front of me, blocking my path.

“You know, Olivia,” she began, her voice sweet but laced with venom, “you really shouldn’t cling to a man who clearly doesn’t want you. It’s… sad and pathetic.”

I told myself to calm down, I refused to let her see my pain. “Is there something you want?” I asked, keeping my tone as steady as I could.

She laughed, a sound that made my chest tighten. “I just thought I’d give you some girly advice.”

I clenched my fists, biting back the urge to lash out. “Are you done?” I asked, but didn't wait for her response.

As I opened my car door, her parting words reached me. “You’re fighting a losing battle, Olivia. You should know when to quit.”

I drove home in silence, her words settling over me like a dark cloud.

That night, Adrian didn’t come home early which had become a routine ever since he came back from his supposed business trip.

And I knew it was because of Dora.

Curiosity got the best of me, and I found myself walking toward the one place Adrian had forbidden me to enter – his study.

I had a strong feeling that I might find something there that would reveal more about Dora and her relationship with Adrian.

I hesitated in front of the door, my pulse racing, but Dora’s smug smile flashed in my mind and I found myself breaking the rules I hadn't broken in three years.

While going through his drawers, I stumbled upon an old, slightly worn-out photograph that made my heartbeat slow and froze me in place.

It was a picture of young Adrian, a pretty woman holding him close, whom I assumed to be his mother because of the resemblance, and my parents, all smiling at the camera.

Everything in me screamed confusion. Why were they together? How was this possible?

My parents never seemed to know Adrian when I first introduced him to them, and even Adrian never mentioned knowing my parents.

My head was filled with different questions, each one adding to the headache that was starting to build.

Why hadn’t Adrian mentioned knowing my parents? Was he hiding something from me? Or was there something my parents had kept from me?

I was snapped back to reality when I heard the door click open downstairs. My heart leaped, and I quickly shoved the photograph back into the drawer, my hands trembling as I hurried back to the bedroom.

Adrian walked in without a word, and the room was filled with the stench of alcohol. I stood awkwardly by the bed, unsure whether to speak or remain silent.

Without warning, he closed the distance between us, his hands gripped my waist.

I hated the way my heart leaped, I knew I should have pushed him, yelled at him, or better still slapped him but I found myself yearning for more.

My heart thumped faster as he kissed me, his movements hungry like a lion that had been starved for days.

“Adrian,” I whispered, but he silenced me, pulling me closer and undressing me.

I knew I shouldn't enjoy it but I did.

That night, he touched me for the second time in three years.

I remembered the first time we were intimate a month ago he was drunk and tonight he was also drunk.

I knew what it meant but I deceived my mind into thinking that it was a hope that things might get better.

The next morning, Adrian acted as if nothing had happened. He stood by the dresser, buttoning his shirt while I lay in bed, watching him.

“Good morning,” I greeted, a blush creeping up my cheeks.

He didn’t respond, his focus was on his tie.

“Adrian,” I said softly, sitting up. “About last night…”

He turned to me, his expression cold. “What about it?”

I hesitated, unsure how to interpret his tone. “I… I just thought…”

“Don’t overthink it,” he interrupted. “I sent some money to your account. Consider it payment for your services.”

His words hit me like a punch to the gut. My lips parted, but no sound came out.

Without another glance, he grabbed his briefcase and left, leaving me sitting there in stunned silence.

Tears blurred my vision as I clutched the sheets, my heart bleeding.

Was this what I had become? A service to be paid for?

# CHAPTER 004

OLIVIA'S POV

I gripped the steering wheel, my hands tight as I drove. I had no destination in mind I just needed to leave the house that constantly reminded me of my failing marriage and emotionally unavailable husband.

The words Adrian had said that morning kept playing in my head, no matter how much I tried to distract myself.

My chest hurt, and I wanted to scream. Three years of marriage, and yet, I was just something he could use. I didn’t know where I was going. I just needed to get away.

Eventually, hours later, I drove back home. I parked in the driveway but stayed in the car for a minute, taking deep breaths. My eyes were still red from crying, and everything felt heavy inside me.

When I finally walked inside, the first thing I saw was a pair of red heels by the door. They weren’t mine. My stomach dropped, and panic rushed in.

I took a deep breath and started walking upstairs. With every step, my heart beat faster. I wanted to turn around and run, but something inside me kept going forward, pushing me to face whatever was waiting.

When I reached the bedroom door, I hesitated. My hand gripped the handle for a while. But I pushed it open anyway.

What I saw froze me.

Dora was lying on the bed, half-dressed, her gown slipping off her shoulder. Adrian was next to her, still in his shirt and pants, fast asleep.

My stomach twisted. I felt like I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think. For a second, I just stood there, staring at them, still not believing my eyes.

Adrian cheating on me was something I could overlook because of love but what I could never take was him bringing his mistress to our home on our matrimonial bed.

That was a disrespect I could never tolerate.

“Adrian!” I shouted, my voice echoing in the room.

Adrian’s eyes fluttered open. He blinked and then looked at me.

A look of confusion crossed his face as he glanced over at Dora who was lying next to him but in a blink of an eye, his face went from that to something colder, more distant.

“Olivia,” he said, voice groggy. He rubbed his eyes like he was just waking from a nap.

I wanted to scream, but I kept my fists clenched and stared at him, waiting for an explanation. Then Dora moved beside him, stretching and smiling at me.

“Oh, Olivia,” she said sweetly, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “You’re home early.”

Her smile, her tone – it made everything worse.

“What is this… Adrian?” I asked, my voice breaking.

He sighed and ran a hand through his hair, looking tired. “Calm down, Olivia,” he said like it was my fault.

“Calm down?” I repeated, my voice getting louder. “You brought her into our matrimonial bed, and now you want me to calm down?”

Dora laughed softly, wrapping the blanket around herself like she was perfectly at ease. “Oh, darling,” she said, her eyes sharp, “don’t make a scene.”

Her words made me sick, but I refused to let her see me lose control. I turned to Adrian. “You don’t even care enough to deny it?”

He looked at me with no emotion, then shrugged. “There’s nothing to deny,” he said, his voice cold.

That hit me like a punch. I felt weak, but I forced myself to stay standing.

He wasn't even remorseful of his action. Was this what I was going to keep on enduring?

No, not anymore. I was tired, tired of the insults and humiliation.

“I want a divorce,” I said. The words just came out.

Since he doesn't love me we can as well stop this hypocritical marriage.

Adrian raised an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. “Go ahead,” he said, not bothered at all.

My heart sank. I guess I expected him to beg me.

“But don’t forget who’s funding your parents’ company.”

His words hit me like a slap.

He continued voice like ice. “If you leave, Olivia, I will pull all the money I’ve put in. Let’s see how long they last without me.”

Tears blurred my vision. Without saying anything else, I turned and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind me.

I collapsed on the couch downstairs, the weight of it all crushing me. The betrayal, the humiliation, the fact that he didn't want to let me go – it was too much.

He said he didn't love me, but now I offered to leave his life and he still wouldn't let me.

I covered my face with my hands and let the tears fall, knowing no matter what he did, he still had the upper hand.

# CHAPTER 005

OLIVIA'S POV

I paced back and forth in my parent's living room, my fists clenched tightly, trying to control the overwhelming anger and hurt that swelled inside me.

My parents were sitting on the couch, looking at me as if I were the one in the wrong.

“Olivia, you have to understand,” my mother said, her voice calm and soothing like she always did when she was trying to manipulate me and make me do her bidding.

“Adrian’s investments in the company, the money, it’s all for the family. We can’t afford to lose that.”

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Was this really how they saw me? A tool to keep the business running?

After telling them what I was going through in that marriage and how I caught him cheating on me on our matrimonial bed without even feeling guilty about his actions after I caught him but instead threatened me.

This was what my biological mother could say to me.

I wanted to yell, but I didn’t. Instead, I clenched my jaw and spoke through gritted teeth. “What about me? What about my happiness?” My voice was barely a whisper, but the hurt was clear in every word.

My father shifted in his seat, avoiding my eyes. “You know how important the business is to this family, Olivia,” he said. “You need to put that first. Adrian’s not perfect, but… staying with him, it’s the only way forward.”

I couldn’t believe this. They weren’t even looking at the bigger picture, weren’t seeing how broken I was.

How every day with Adrian damaged my self-esteem, causing me emotional trauma.

“I’m not a business deal, Dad!” I snapped. “You’re telling me to sacrifice my life just so you can keep this empire afloat. What about me? What about my future?”

My mother’s expression hardened, and she stood up, walking over to me. “We’re trying to help you, Olivia,” she said, her tone now loud. “You have a responsibility to your family, to this company. Adrian’s your husband, whether you like it or not.”

I felt the tears welling up in my eyes. “I’m hurting Mom, I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’m not just some… accessory to this business. I'm your child – your blood”

My words hung in the air, but nothing changed. They were focused on the company, not me. I felt like I was suffocating.

I couldn’t take it anymore. With my heart racing, I stormed out of the house, slamming the door behind me. I needed to get away, to think, to know my next step.

I walked out onto the estate, trying to clear my head. I was so lost, so trapped. My feet took me further down the long driveway, my mind a whirlwind of confusion and anger.

That’s when I saw her.

Dora. 

The woman Adrian cheated on me with.

She was standing by the entrance to the estate like she’d been waiting for me. A smirk curled on her lips when she saw me.

What was she doing here? Was she also living here?

The White estate was quite expensive to afford. The apartment my parents lived in was bought by Adrian after we got married as a gift. I wondered how she could afford it, well I didn't know much about her.

Dora didn’t have to say anything, I could feel the challenge in the air between us.

I stopped in my tracks, feeling every nerve in my body tense. I didn’t have the energy for this, not now. But I knew she wasn’t going to make it easy for me.

“Olivia,” she said, her voice dripping with venom and a fake smile etched on her face. “I didn’t expect to see you out here. Is everything okay at home? Or are you just too embarrassed to face Adrian after all that happened?”

My heart raced at the mention of Adrian. I wanted to walk away, but her words felt like a slap in the face. I stood my ground, meeting her gaze. “What do you want?”

She stepped closer, her heels clicking on the pavement. “What do I want? Oh, nothing much. Just wanted to see if you were still playing the dutiful wife… making a fool out of yourself.”

I could feel the anger boiling up inside me. And I was tempted to slap her across the face, but I held back. “Don’t think you’re better than me,” I spat. “You’re just a pathetic little whore.”

Smack!

Her hands landed on my cheeks and I must admit it stung so bad. I also retaliated and slapped her too then started walking towards my car.

I was done trying to be gentle.

One minute I was walking to my car, the next I found myself falling face down, and I crashed to the pavement.

Dora pushed me.

Pain shot up my spine, and I gasped, but it was nothing compared to the sharp, burning pain in my abdomen.

I tried to lift myself, but something was wrong. I could feel the blood, the warmth spreading across my legs. My breath caught in my throat, panic flooding my senses and I could feel myself losing consciousness.

“Help me” I managed to whisper.

Dora stood there, her expression now more smug than ever, like she’d won some game.

“Oops… Guess you’re just too fragile for this,” she said, her tone mocking. But even her words seemed distant now. I could barely hear her.

Everything felt blurry like I was sinking. I didn’t know how long I lay there.

Then I heard someone shouting for help before I blacked out completely.

# CHAPTER 006

OLIVIA'S POV

Beep. Beep.

Those were the first sounds I heard as my consciousness slowly returned. My eyelids felt impossibly heavy, and every part of my body ached as if I had been run over by a truck. 

I blinked several times, my vision blurry and unfocused, trying to make sense of my surroundings. The harsh fluorescent lights above me were blinding, forcing me to shut my eyes momentarily before attempting to open them again.

I was in a hospital.

The scent of antiseptics and the faint humming of machines confirmed it before I could fully process my memories. Panic gripped me as flashes of what had happened resurfaced in my mind.

Dora.

I gasped softly, my fingers twitching against the cool sheets of the hospital bed. The memory of her smug expression, her taunting words, the pain that followed after she deliberately pushed me everything came crashing down at once. My breathing became shallow as fear and rage swirled in my chest.

A soft rustling sound drew my attention, and I sluggishly turned my head. A couple of nurses were standing near my bed, their expressions unreadable as they monitored the machines around me. One of them noticed my movement and immediately hurried out of the room, presumably to call the doctor.

I tried to sit up, but an intense wave of dizziness crashed over me, forcing me to fall back onto the pillows with a sharp exhale. My body felt weak, more exhausted than I had ever been in my life.

Moments later, the doctor walked in, his expression professional yet kind. He quickly checked my vitals, his brows furrowing slightly as he made notes on his clipboard. I wanted to speak, to ask what had happened to me, but my throat was dry, and my voice refused to come out.

“How are you feeling?” he asked, his tone calm and reassuring.

I tried to respond, but my lips barely moved. Seeing my struggle, he shook his head gently. “Relax. There’s no need to stress yourself. You’re still recovering, and your body needs rest.”

I swallowed dryly and rubbed my eyes with trembling fingers, still trying to sit up properly. I felt so disoriented, so lost. Something was nagging at the back of my mind – a deep, unsettling feeling that I was forgetting something crucial.

Then, the doctor continued speaking, explaining the extent of my injuries. My head was still spinning, making it difficult to fully grasp his words, but then I caught a sentence that sent ice shooting through my veins.

“I’m sorry, Miss, but you lost your baby.”

My eyes snapped open in shock. My heart stopped for a moment as my mind struggled to comprehend his words.

Baby?

I was pregnant?

And I lost it?

The words felt foreign, unreal like I had stepped into someone else’s nightmare.

“What…what did you just say?” I forced the words out, my voice barely above a whisper.

The doctor’s expression softened. “The little accident you were involved in caused you to lose your pregnancy. I’m truly sorry for your loss.”

I felt my heart clench, an unbearable weight pressing down on my chest. My hands instinctively moved to my abdomen, but there was nothing there – nothing but the dull ache of loss. 

My baby was gone. A child I hadn’t even known existed had been taken from me before I could even dream of its future.

Tears welled up in my eyes, blurring my vision as the reality of it all settled in. The walls of the hospital room seemed to close in on me, suffocating me. My breath hitched, and the machine beside me began to beep faster and faster as my heart rate spiked.

“Miss, you need to calm down,” the doctor urged his hands checking my pulse as the nurse adjusted the IV in my arm.

But how could I calm down? How could I just accept this?

The doctor continued speaking, but his voice faded into the background as my thoughts spiraled. My entire life had been a cycle of pain and disappointment. For three years, I had endured nothing but sorrow, and now this? How much more could the world take from me before it decided I had suffered enough?

I sobbed silently, gripping the sheets tightly, my body shaking as grief consumed me.

Then, another emotion began to take root, burning through my sorrow like fire consuming dry wood.

Rage.

Dora.

That witch had taken everything from me – my dignity, my pride, and now, my child. This wasn’t just an accident. It was her doing. She had done this to me, and she was going to pay.

Through my tears, I heard the doctor and the nurse discussing something a few feet away. I forced myself to listen despite the pounding in my head.

“Were you able to get in touch with any of her contacts?” the doctor asked the nurse.

“Yes, I called her husband and informed him,” the nurse responded.

There was a pause before the doctor spoke again. “So, he should be on his way then?”

The nurse hesitated, shifting uncomfortably. “Actually…he said he wasn’t coming.”

A bitter laugh almost escaped my lips.

Of course, Adrian wouldn’t come. What was I expecting? He had never cared about me. Why would he start now?

The doctor frowned. “Are you sure he said that?”

“Absolutely. Even I was shocked by his response. I honestly don’t know how he can leave his wife alone in a situation like this,” the nurse replied, her voice tinged with disbelief.

The doctor sighed. “Try reaching out to another one of her contacts perhaps her parents or a close friend.”

“Alright, sir,” the nurse responded, scrolling through my phone.

I shut my eyes, forcing myself to push past the fresh wave of pain. I knew my parents would show up. They had to. Despite our differences, they wouldn’t abandon me in a moment like this.

At least, that was what I hoped.

Eventually, exhaustion overtook my body, and I slipped into a restless sleep, my mind haunted by the loss I had suffered.

Hours later, I was woken by the sound of a familiar, deep voice beside me. My eyelids fluttered open, my vision still a bit blurry from sleep.

For a fleeting moment, I thought it was Adrian, that maybe just maybe he had decided to come after all. But as my vision cleared, I saw that it wasn’t him.

It was Julian.

My heart clenched at the sight of him. Julian, my best friend, the one person who had always been there for me no matter what. We had known each other since college, our bond unshaken despite the chaos Adrian had thrown our way in a bid to seperate our friendship.

He was sitting beside my bed, his sharp blue eyes filled with worry as he studied me.

“Liv,” he murmured, his voice softer than I’d ever heard it before. “Thank God you’re awake.”

Tears welled up in my eyes again, but this time, they weren’t just from pain.They were from relief.

Brother Eli woke at three, as usual—no alarm, no ceremony. He reached out from bed and clicked on the lamp with a quiet tug of the pullchain, the bulb warming the stone room with a soft, amber light. The walls—old mountain stone, hand-set centuries ago—held the night’s chill like memory. He swung his feet to the floor, the cold rising up through the soles, familiar. The kitchen wasn’t far; nothing in the monastery ever was. He brewed coffee in the French press, slow and silent, and carried the mug to his desk—a heavy oak thing smoothed by decades of elbows and ink stains. The laptop flickered on. No frills. Just a matte-black shell and a clean connection through the monastery’s LEO satlink. Out here, the internet wasn’t for scrolling. It was how they found people who needed to be found. Hospice requests. Runaways. A deacon in Utica who hadn’t prayed in six months. Eli read them all, sipping slowly, eyes steady.

Breakfast, if it could be called that, was a single kosher sausage wrapped in wax paper—room temp, no plate. Eli took slow bites between sips of coffee, the spice waking him just enough to stay ahead of his age. The monastery didn’t run on schedules so much as instincts, and his always told him: eat now, work later. Right on cue, Brother Dog padded in from the hall, claws clicking gently against stone. A Saint Bernard–Bernese mix the size of a small bear, with eyes like he knew how the world would end but wasn’t in a rush to get there. He sat down beside Eli without ceremony, leaned his heavy shoulder against the monk’s calf, and exhaled like the morning had already asked too much. Eli broke off the end of the sausage and held it out. “We’re not savages,” he muttered, feeding the dog. “Just quiet.”

He finished his coffee in the quiet, reading one last line from an email he wouldn’t answer until after sunrise. Then he closed the laptop with the kind of care most people reserve for sacred texts. No rush. No sound but the soft click of plastic and the distant creak of wood shifting somewhere in the old walls. He reached down and rested a hand on Brother Dog’s massive head, fingers brushing through thick fur gone gray around the ears. The dog leaned into it just slightly, a rumble of contentment rising from deep in his chest. “Still with me, eh?” Eli asked, not expecting an answer. He stood, bones cracking politely, and crossed to the door. His boots were waiting—scuffed leather, simple and loyal. He stepped into them one foot at a time, no laces, just the familiar tug of habit fitting around him like the morning air.

Eli stepped into the hall, boots thudding soft against worn stone as the monastery stirred around him in its usual half-sleep. The air held that early-hour stillness, like the building itself was between breaths. As he passed the common room, he paused in the doorway, not out of curiosity but familiarity. Brother Turner had passed out on the couch again, limbs tangled like a puppet mid-collapse. The headset still clung to one ear, faint digital gunfire crackling from it. A controller lay balanced on his chest like a last rite, and his long red hair—frizzed and escaping its tie—draped down over the armrest like ivy. He snored, mouth open, one foot on the floor like it might ground him in some other life. Eli didn’t say a word. Just watched for a moment, eyes soft, then moved on.

By the time Eli passed the kitchen again, Carlos was already up—barefoot, mumbling in Spanglish, opening cabinets like they might’ve rearranged themselves overnight. He wore the same threadbare hoodie he always did before dawn, sleeves rolled up, hands moving through muscle memory: skillet, eggs, something with beans. The smell hadn’t hit yet, but it would. Carlos didn’t look over, didn’t need to. He just raised one hand in a half-wave without turning, and Eli answered it with a nod. No words exchanged. None needed. Just two men shaped by too many lives, sharing the same stretch of time before the rest of the world remembered how to want things.

Eli opened the heavy back door, the old iron latch giving way with a familiar clunk, and stepped out into the threshold between stone and soil. The air was cool and damp, touched by last night’s rain—he could smell it in the moss, feel it in the soft give of the earth beneath his boots. Overhead, the great glass arc of the greenhouse caught the first light of morning, still jeweled with droplets that hadn’t yet burned off. They clung to the panes like prayers that hadn’t found mouths yet. The gardens below steamed faintly where warmth met wetness, rows of greens and root crops slowly waking with the sun. Eli paused, one hand resting on the doorframe, and just breathed.

Brother Dog barreled past a second later, all muscle and morning breath, nearly knocking Eli off balance as he shoved through the open door with the urgency of a creature who’d just remembered he had legs. Eli grunted, caught himself with a hand to the frame, and muttered something that might’ve been a blessing or a curse. The dog didn’t notice—already bounding toward the dew-wet grass like he meant to interrogate every goat on the property. His tail wagged in slow, deliberate arcs, a kind of flag announcing: *I’m here, I’m awake, and the world better be ready for it.* Eli shook his head, a small smile playing at the edge of his mouth. “Galut,” he said softly. “You’ve got the soul of a barn door.”

Eli followed the worn footpath toward the stone archway that framed the greenhouse entrance, its keystone etched with moss and time. The garden on either side stretched in quiet profusion—untamed, but not neglected. Tomatoes spilled out of their beds in tangled vines, heavy with fruit. Sage and thyme pushed into the gravel, stubborn and fragrant. Potatoes, fat with secrecy, nestled under mounded dirt like secrets waiting for the right hands. He passed lavender, marjoram, a rogue stalk of corn trying its luck, and too many greens to count. He used to name each one aloud on his morning walk, a kind of ritual inventory. Lately, he just let them speak for themselves. The plants didn’t mind. They knew he knew them.

As Eli stepped beneath the stone arch and into the gentle warmth of the greenhouse perimeter, the first thing he noticed was the silence. No goats. No soft bleats, no impatient hooves scratching at the gate near the entrance. The barn was empty, door ajar. The pen gate, still latched, but they’d slipped it before. He scanned the grounds slowly, eyes narrowing with the kind of tired amusement only herders and parents knew well. “Wandered again,” he muttered. It wasn’t the first time. Wouldn’t be the last. The herd had a knack for pushing past boundaries—half-wild and wholly unrepentant. Somewhere out there, likely near the cave mouth or nibbling herbs they weren’t supposed to, they were already pretending they’d been there all along.

Brother Dog took off to the left, nose to the ground, tail swinging wide as a weathervane. He sniffed with the conviction of a bloodhound and the grace of a sack of laundry, tracking the goat trail with growing enthusiasm. Eli let him go, feet finding their way down the ancient stone walkway that cut through the heart of the grounds. The stones were uneven in places, edges softened by centuries of rain and soles. On either side stood the quiet buildings: the old forge, long cold but still smelling faintly of ash; the workshop, its tools hung in silent rows like monks waiting for a calling; and farther down, the garage—more modern, but only barely. Inside sat the Volkswagen van, its blue paint sun-faded and patchy. The thing should’ve died decades ago, but Carlos kept it purring like a contented cat. Some called it a miracle. Eli just called it maintenance and a little stubborn love.

Eli rounded the curve toward the old stone bridge, its arch rising low and moss-covered over the narrow creek that carved its way along the monastery’s edge. The water beneath it was shallow this time of year, moving slow and clear, murmuring over stones like it was half-remembering a hymn. The bridge marked the true boundary—not just of the grounds, but of something older. He’d felt it since the first time he crossed it as a boy: a hush that didn’t belong to weather or distance. As he approached, Brother Dog stopped dead ahead, tail lifting stiffly. Then a low whine, nose twitching toward the base of the bridge. One paw lifted, then another, claws scraping at the stone as he leaned forward, head tilted. Eli’s heart didn’t race—but it did settle. The dog only alerted like that for two reasons: newborn goat… or stranger.

Eli stepped to the edge of the bridge, placing one hand on the cool, moss-slick stone. There was a spot near the southern lip where the wall dipped just enough to give a line of sight into the cave mouth below—a shadowed hollow at the creek’s bend, hidden unless you knew exactly where to look. He leaned over carefully, eyes adjusting to the dim. At first, it was just wet stone, a scatter of fallen leaves, the faint sheen of pooled rainwater. Then—movement. A shape. Curled near the back of the hollow was a man. Large. Broad-shouldered. Soaked through and curled in on himself like a dog caught in a storm. He wasn’t shivering, but he looked like he should’ve been. Eli didn’t call out. Didn’t move. Just watched, breath steady, letting the world tell him what it needed to.

Eli was already moving—across the bridge, up the path, boots brushing dew from grass that hadn’t yet decided to dry. No panic, just purpose. He slipped back into the house through the side door, the quiet wrapping around him like a coat. The pack was right where it always waited—canvas faded and soft, its cast iron pan riding snug at the base like an old truth. In the pantry, he moved quick but sure: a thick heel of yesterday’s bread, a generous strip of cured boar bacon wrapped in wax paper, a chunk of goat cheese, and a tin of loose tobacco. Last, he poured a thermos of coffee from the still-hot pot Carlos had left steaming on the stove. Lid tightened, pack shouldered, he gave the kitchen a glance—like it might hold a question he hadn’t asked—then turned and stepped out again, headed for the creek.

On the way back, Eli detoured toward the chicken coop, boots crunching soft against gravel and straw. The hens were already rustling, clucking low in their feathered huddle as he unlatched the door. He stepped inside without fuss, the birds parting around him like a tide. Three warm eggs disappeared into the side pocket of his pack, cushioned in a folded rag. He scattered a handful of grain across the ground with a practiced sweep of his hand, and the coop came alive with rustling wings and eager pecking. “That’s rent,” he muttered, pulling the door shut behind him with a soft clack. Then he turned, heading back toward the creek, the weight of food and iron steady on his shoulder.

By the time Eli reached the bridge again, his breath was just shy of even—deep and slow, with that familiar pull at the ribs that age delivers like a quiet joke. He paused for a moment, hand resting on the stone, then stepped off the path and made his way down the bank. The slope was slick in places, washed clean by the rain, but he moved with the care of someone who knew which patches held and which would slide. Brother Dog watched from above, head tilted, tail still. Eli didn’t speak. Just shifted his weight low, boots angled sideways, and began the slow, deliberate descent toward the shadowed mouth of the cave. Each step was its own little negotiation with gravity, with time, with the quiet promise that whatever lay ahead—he was coming with kindness in hand.

At the base of the slope, Eli stepped carefully onto the wet stone, eyes never leaving the figure curled against the wall. The man hadn’t moved—still soaked, still breathing, still folded into himself like a wound. Eli crouched beside him, quiet as a closing door, and slipped the pack off his shoulder. From within, he pulled a wool blanket, rough and thick, smelling faintly of cedar and smoke. He draped it gently over the man’s shoulders, tucking it around him without intrusion. Then, with practiced ease, he cleared a small patch of stone nearby, laid down two dry sticks he always kept wrapped in oilcloth, and teased a fire to life with a twist of tinder and a whisper of breath. The flame caught quick and low, crackling into warmth. Not much—but enough. Eli sat back on his heels and watched it grow, letting the silence hold.

Eli pulled the skillet from his pack and set it carefully over the fire, the iron warming with a slow, even heat. The bacon went in first—thick strips of cured boar crackling to life, scent curling upward like a promise. He filled the small tin pot he kept clipped to the pack with water from the creek—clear and cold, clean enough this high up to need no second thoughts—and set it at the edge of the fire to boil. The steam rose soft and steady, the smell of meat and woodsmoke beginning to wrap around the mouth of the cave like a blanket all its own. Eli didn’t rush. He cooked the way he prayed—slow, attentive, with both hands. The man still hadn’t moved, but Brother Dog had settled nearby, watching the fire with eyes half-closed. The silence was thicker now, but not heavy. Just waiting.

The man began to wake just as Eli cracked the eggs into the bacon grease, the hiss and pop of it rising like soft percussion against the morning quiet. Eli didn’t turn, didn’t speak—just poured the boiling water into the press, the rich scent of coffee unfurling into the damp air. Behind him, a low groan, the shifting of heavy limbs against cold stone. The man moved slowly, like someone remembering his body in pieces—first the breath, then the hands, then the weight of being upright. The blanket had slipped partway down, clinging wet to his shoulders. He blinked blearily at the fire, eyes catching the steam, the food, the stranger crouched beside flame like some old mountain spirit. Eli didn’t look at him right away. Just swirled the coffee, watching the grounds settle. “Mornin’,” he said, calm and warm. “Figured you might be hungry.”",2,1747327446.0,OpenHFY,2,1.0,False

1kncvng,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kncvng/i_left_my_fiancé_cause_he_opened_one_of_my_moms/,I Left my Fiancé cause He Opened One of My Mom's Trinkets.,"So I'm sitting here, at my desk and a few sips of some cream liquor while writing this to cool my nerves. It has been an intense few weeks, more intense than I can ever imagine. Someone I though I would spend the rest of my life with because of the fact I couldn't help him, and because they didn't listen to the warning I gave the day they found the trinket. I'll give some context to this but this writing is a warning to other people who don't believe in the paranormal or are some degree of a skeptic. I won't be using our actual names for privacy of both myself and my former significant other.

So to give some context. I still live in my childhood home, both my parents have passed and I inherited the small house that sits in the country. Sucks that it's in the middle of nowhere, but owning the house means I don't have to pay any form of rent. So I'm happy to stay there. I lived there alone for a long time. Then I met Sam. He was this lanky bean pole, sweet guy. He was a total nerd and I loved him for it. We were pretty much compatible, months turned into a few years of a relationship. One of the things we didn't click on though; it was the fact that he didn't believe in supernatural things but I on the other hand did to a degree. It was mainly because of how I grew up.

You see, my mom's side of the family practiced all sorts of magic and witchcraft. Some of the standard stuff like card readings to things that were much more leaning in the occult. I had seen some things that were a degree unnatural, but I always brushed it off as my imagination getting to me due to being raised in around this most of my life. My dad passed when I was young, so I was raised by my mom. So I saw a whole lot of this odd stuff go on. One thing I remember big time was the fact that whenever someone died, personal family friend or someone we had intense hatred for, my mom would take a small box. Put objects in it and bind it with a ribbon in an intricate knot. I don't know the specifics. My mom even though practicing, didn't want to teach what she knew to me. She always said, ""The practice dies with me"". She never wanted to pass it on to her children. Neither me nor my sister knew anything but maybe the most barebones of what she practiced.

To those boxes specifically. My mom always said, ""It's to stop a person from sticking around"". What this mean was that in part of my family's beliefs is that when someone dies some parts don't want to leave. In some ways it's like how ghosts are at times depicted as imprints of a person rather than the actual spirit lingering. These boxes were made to basically trap or ward off these imprints. Mainly to stop imprints of malice towards certain people. The idea was that things like hate would seek out people, people the recently deceased had intense hatred for. That is why she warned me to never open them. Maybe before all this I just shrugged it off as a tradition made up by long dead relatives. After the last few weeks, I know for a fact that I will never even go near one of those boxes when I find them.

To the fateful day everything went wrong. I was with Sam, digging and getting my garden ready. I love growing my own produce and had picked out a spot to plant a bunch of peppers. We were digging the ground up, tilling it with garden soil to make it perfect whenever something got pulled up. A small box with a ribbon sealed in a plastic bag. Sam of course looked at me and asked, ""What the hell is this?"". I joked it off, telling him the whole thing with my mom and her little trinket boxes, and told him to put it away somewhere and forget about it. He didn't, and decided to pry. So I better explained it; of course getting a laugh in response as of how ridiculous something like this sounded. Sam saying, ""Then why not just throw the box down a river or something"", I responded with a shrug. I couldn't give a solid answer, I knew not to mess with the boxes and I had similar questions. Only answer I'd ever get was that destroying the container would be as bad as opening it up.

He teased me about it, joking how I needed to stop with all this silly stuff that my family taught me. He said, ""Witchcraft isn't real, John. We're not going to be haunted or anything if I opened it"". I stopped him, maybe a bit to harsh. I had been told and basically conditioned to leave those boxes alone for so long that even the thought of it made me nervous. Back then, it wasn't because I thought something bad would happen but because of the conditioning of a person who had been dead for a few years now. Maybe I was just scared of the fact it wasn't what my mom said, maybe she was hiding something she didn't want me to see. I didn't want to damage that memory of her.

He did eventually put the box away, and we left it alone for a while. It was fading from my mind the next week until the topic came up. He asked questions about it all, and I went into as depth as I could. The boxes, practices my family did that I knew about, and the whole belief that certain things linger after we die. He shrugged it off again, just finding the whole thing silly. He mentioned how it was just a bunch of superstitions that were passed down over generations. I responded with the fact that it may be that way, but I had wanted to respect them even if it was something as silly as not messing with a box wrapped up by a ribbon and buried in the dirt. We left it there and moved on from it. He'd occasionally mess with me about it, but it would never go that far.

I got back from work one day, about two weeks after we had our last discussion of the box. He was at the kitchen table, and there it was. The box open, the ribbon not undone but cut. He looked at me and joked, ""See. There's nothing to worry about. It's just a bunch of junk"", pointing to the contents of the box. I froze for a bit and walked over when I finally got that paranoid jolt to calm down. I then looked down on the table, and there were a number of things. Objects that didn't have much cohesion. A small card that had a depiction of Jesus, a few small trinkets that I didn't find too important, and a small figure made of a few sticks wrapped. I couldn't tell at first but then that shimmer came along. It was hair, a familiar shade of blonde that was obviously worn and starting to decay but I knew that hair. My mom had a similar dirty blonde shade on her head; this was my mom's hair. I felt a pinch in my chest. The last time I saw that shade, that color was the day I rested my head to hers during the final viewing. I won't lie, I felt tears wanting to form to just have some semblance of her right there in front of me. Some part of her that hadn't been burned away into ash and bone shards.

I was calm, even though so much of me wanted to scream at him. . It came out as me simply putting a hand on his shoulder, patting it and asking him to not do that again. I remember saying that I wasn't angry, but he should respect the beliefs that I was raised with just like how I respected he didn't believe in things like this. He did apologize to a degree, though trying to defend himself by saying he just couldn't stop being curious about what was inside the box. I gave a sarcastic remark, telling him how he really just wanted to try and prove me wrong and that ghosts and ghouls didn't exist which got a small laugh out of the two of us. I took the box and contents whenever he wasn't around and put it to the state it was before. I then slipped it into a small space in my barn shed, a spot I knew he'd never look. I thought, 'No reason for him to care if I put it back'.

Things started getting strange a few days in. It started with Sam, he didn't seem to be sleeping much. He constantly said it was just a rough night, needing a bit of a larger cup of coffee in the morning than usual. At that time the only bit of info I could pry out of him was the fact he was having weird nightmares. He wouldn't go into further context, just saying that the dreams were really damn weird. Then it went to things happening, objects in the house moving. Small things like car keys, our phones, maybe something we had just put down seeming to disappear and be found in other parts of the house. We shrugged it off, things like that get misplaced all the time. Where it really got weird was about another week in after things started moving. My dog, my sweet little terrier mix started acting funny. She'd look in spots, mainly when Sam was in the room. Seeming like she was looking at something, and even growling. Won't lie, even back then it was creepy but Sam reassured me that it was just my dog being dumb.

I was getting nervous at this point. Nervous because of the fact that weirder and weirder things were happening after the ribbon on that box was cut open. I kept it to myself though, knowing that Sam was going to just brush me off. It went from small things to big really fast. We were both in the living room, talking and Sam got up. He began to walk towards the long narrow hallway that led to the other rooms in the house, and then he stopped. He paused in his step and looked down the hall, his eyes wide for a moment before shaking his head. I had asked him what was happening but he said it was nothing, just had a moment. I could tell it wasn't just that though, he seemed off put by whatever he saw and he was just trying to stop himself from playing into some sort of trick his mind was playing.

I would start noticing things too. When I was in the house alone I felt like I had eyes on me. No matter what room I was in, it always felt like there was a pair of eyes looming over me. I always felt watched, like some creep was just peering through my windows at all hours of the day. I felt like I didn't have a moment of privacy to myself. I kept things quiet, just doing what I could to ignore the feeling. It would always leave when I left home was off to work, around other people and places seemed to make that feeling melt away. I thought I was being paranoid.

I'll stop here. Mainly cause I'm starting to feel the booze I'm drinking really pass through and I don't wanna pass out in my desk chair. I'll be sure to finish explaining things whenever I sleep this off and get the feeling to come back and tell everyone the rest of the story.",15,1747327281.0,nosleep,1,0.94,False

I’m a 29M who just moved to Munich last week. I’m pretty open-minded, easygoing, and get along with people well. I love playing tennis—I’d say I’m around an intermediate level—and I’d really like to find some fellow players around the same skill level to hit some balls with. I haven’t quite figured out the best spots or clubs yet, so any recommendations would be super helpful!

Outside of tennis, I’m down for pretty much any social activities—hangouts, museums, exploring the city, you name it. I’m really just looking to meet new people and avoid that feeling of loneliness that comes with moving somewhere new.

Good tea is secondary in my opinion, teaware is first, because if I don't have expensive pots where I can properly cook the cha, then I should drink coffee at that point 😂😂. But anyways, I recently came across 2 options for teaware, that can help me get the good qi out of the cha. The first is Jesse's pure silver teapot, they are absolute beauties, crafted by good entrepreneurs in the Silversmith Village (kinda sounds like an anime 😄). I really like the asian look of some designs, orientalism blending in to the aluminum like body - nice! The second option is from Mei, the Leafguy, he is selling some fine Yi-xing teapots. While clay is not as prestigious as aluminum, the internet assured me, that these type of pots are REALLY trendy in Asia. Also as I heard, most of the 'xing teapots are made in factories now, and I'm really glad, because it means consistent, high quality cha-pots. So which one should I pick?

1kncqj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kncqj3/aio_still_not_over_cruel_proposal/,AIO? Still not over cruel proposal.,"**Am I overreacting?** My partner thinks I am. He doesn't understand why I can't just *""get over it.""*

Throwaway account for privacy. Names and locations not given. Skip down to the day of the proposal for speed. Next few paragraphs are background.

I had never spent one moment of my life picturing a proposal for myself, even as a child. Never even really wanted to get married. I had brought up in conversation before that I found public displays cringe. Apart from that—I would have been happy with a glass of wine and a dinner at home.

My partner of 10 years also agreed we would never get married—apparently, he was just throwing me off the scent in recent months. Fine for a really happy couple who’d agreed they *would* get married. Not a great tactic for two 30-somethings with a lot of problems that needed to be worked out.

**Intuition starts to pick up:** He suddenly started saying we needed to have a lovely vacation. I was extremely overwhelmed at work and needed a break, so I agreed to take time off in March. I *really, really* needed this break. He asked me to pick some domestic locations. I gave two options: one a bit closer to us, and one in my ancestral area, where my parents and grandparents are from. He picked the latter. He said it was going to be ""really special."" He encouraged me to book a more expensive room.

My mother was on loudspeaker one day, and he said we were going on a ""very special trip"" to her home county. It suddenly made me think, *wait a second, is he going to propose?* I said there was one particular Georgian mansion in the area, open to the public, that we simply had to visit while planning our itinerary one day. I had lots of happy childhood memories there. The next day, he told me he was going to plan a ""special and romantic picnic"" for me in the grounds of this Georgian house. I couldn’t believe it. *Wow, I think he might actually be going to propose now? This is so out of character for him. Wow.*

*How thoughtful. How special. What a fantastic choice: a private, quiet picnic, just us, in a beautiful place where I have happy memories.* I'm so impressed. I'd never imagined a proposal, but now that this picture has been painted? *Yes, this is perfect.* If he can be *that* considerate of me, maybe I *could* marry him.

But he’s been saying we *won’t?* And actually, he gave me two options for a location—I just happened to pick the home county. So I’d knock the idea out of my head and continue on with my day. I was still really, really looking forward to this picnic though—proposal or not.

**Some background on my partner and our living circumstances:** At this stage, it's important to note that my partner has ADHD and struggles with planning. I don’t care. I plan everything. I plan and book my own birthday dinners. I plan all the holidays. He also has OCD and is happiest either at home, or letting off steam with his friends in the pub after work, or going to his personal trainer. I struggle to get him to agree to come to the movies with me (because people could sneeze, affecting his OCD, and the sounds are too overstimulating, affecting his ADHD). I had to get him to agree to come for a hike and do a normal couple thing as a *birthday present* one year. When we finished the hike, he wouldn’t even go to the local café I wanted to go to. He insisted on going home first. Then insister on a cafe closer to our house. This was my whole birthday present. Him not drinking on a Friday so we could hike and do a cafe nearby (dog friendly with ours) on a Saturday. We had to leave our dog at home for the local cafe.

This is all important for later—and to show how *out of character* planning a picnic for me was. I felt so special—for once.

I should also point out that we live downstairs in his parents’ ground-level apartment. We haven’t separated the units yet. We live in an *extreme* housing crisis. I would happily move out and get a mortgage, but he doesn’t feel capable of it. We would need to move far away to afford it. He doesn’t want to. His parents are really wealthy. He wants to live in the house as one unit so he can inherit without paying tax. This meant if we got married, I could never own my own property—as it would count as his, and he’d have to pay hundreds of thousands to inherit.

I could never live without being on the property ladder in a house I had no claim to, so I said I’d just not marry him and buy my own place. I *can* afford to. I have a good salary. I love his parents—they’re great, though obviously there’s some stuff around the umbilical cord needing to be cut in certain situations.

**His OCD/ADHD mess:** Weeks before the trip, he had started a second paid project on top of his job. I was really proud of him. Our place, however, became a *mess.* We're talking every room is a floordrobe—plates, cups, glasses with food left everywhere. How he turns the entire place into his own bedroom is a constant source of discomfort for me, but these few weeks were like nothing I had ever seen.

I let him off because of the project, but was planning on sitting him down after and explaining that I was saving for my own place, and if things got like this again, I simply couldn’t be asked to live in someone else’s filth like that again.

I have my *own* bedroom because I find his inhabitable. We also have different schedules, so I sleep and work in one room. He comes home to our kitchen/living room, which is also his office and studio (as you can tell by the mess). It is *supposed* to be our sitting room, but it definitely just feels like his mancave. In the 5 months since we moved in downstairs, I have never so much as scrolled through TikTok in that room.

**Approaching the trip:**  
The trip date approached, and I was dying for the break from work. We booked a special hotel that my aunty had gotten married in, and my grandmother had her 80th birthday in. I couldn’t wait to get down there and rest—and this magical picnic was circulating in my head at all times. When I walked the dog, when I went to the gym, I pictured the peace of this beautiful picnic. I told my hairdresser friend about it—I couldn’t believe this guy was actually planning a picnic for me.

The trip approached and I checked the weather. It was going to rain on one of the days—but only a bit. I warned my partner and said we might have to go to the Georgian house on the Sunday or Monday instead.

Two nights before the trip, I was working late to make up for the days I was going to miss in my high-pressure job. The stress was building and I got only 3 hours of sleep. The evening before the trip, I was *extremely* exhausted. I’d never felt anything like it. I was groaning in pain from the tiredness—to a point where I wondered if I might be pregnant. Worse still, I couldn’t indulge in sleep—I still had to pack, and the train was at 11 a.m.

I should also point out that I have ADHD and back pain, which causes intense insomnia. I’m great at living off no sleep. *This was different. This was so bad.*

I told my partner, who came home from work to me in tired agony, that I’d need to pass out, set an alarm for midnight, and wake up to pack. I did this. On the night when I needed sleep *most*, I couldn’t. There was still stuff to get done.

He started waking me up and asking if we could “please, please” change the train to the 3 p.m. one. I said that would rob us of a whole day—the journey took 4 hours. He didn’t want us rushing in the morning. I said, *“That’s why I’m packing tonight.”* I knew it would rain one of the days, but not the next day, and we needed to grab the sunny one. He said *“fine.”*

**The morning of the proposal:**  
The next day he woke me up at 9 a.m. Our taxi was booked for 10. I still had to finish some packing. He was intense. In a bad mood. I was exhausted, as he *knew* I was. His mom yelled down the stairs, asking if she could take the dog for her walk yet. This made him *intensely* angry. He told her to go away—that he wanted the animals to be there before we left. I *hate* when he argues with his mother in front of me. It can get *highly* inappropriate. I couldn’t believe they were doing it on the morning of this trip he’d built up for me. I wanted to stay away from him now. Things were just getting intense.

I went into my room, sleepy-eyed, no coffee yet, no breakfast, no makeup on, to finish packing.

**The proposal:**  
All of a sudden, with one sock on, he grabbed my hand and led me (in his weird mood) into what I think of as *his* man cave, with our animals. It turns out he had been up all night cleaning his mess. I could see the floor. *Fab.* He had even put some nice pictures up on the counters. I thought, *Wow, OK, maybe he is gonna propose. He’s making sure I come home to a clean house. I mean, it’s his own mess he cleaned, but that’s a start.*

He sat me down on the couch and threw a box on the table. It was *still in its packaging.*  
He said, *“What’s that there?”*  
I was confused.

I was like, *“What’s this?”* Genuinely thinking it was a key to a boat or something and we were going to rent one. I took too long to open the packaging for his liking, so he whipped the box out of my hands, unwrapped it himself, and handed a ring box back to me.

It’s a ring. Sitting, with his arms and legs sprawled over the couch, he quietly says, *“Will you marry me.”*

Now, all of a sudden, the whole morning makes sense. He yelled at his mother for suggesting to take the dog—because she clearly *knew* he needed the dog for the proposal. We love our animals. Now I know his family is in on it and waiting for my answer upstairs. I think, *Well, I would have said yes if he asked me at the picnic,* so, deflated, and half-focused on the fact that we have to catch a train, I say *“yes.”*

With one sock, no makeup, no coffee, a foggy brain that’s focused on finishing packing—the reality starts to sink in.

No more than two seconds later, he says, *“Yeah, I couldn’t do the picnic because it was going to rain.”*  
Oh, ok. So that’s not even happening anymore.  
He goes on to say, *“My therapist and friend said that this would be better so we can get it done and enjoy the trip after.”*

This made *zero* sense to me.

I looked up, and saw his shirts, hanging off of our lamps- ones he never got to. I realised he was only cleaning his filth up as a once-off for my proposal. What was supposed to be asked to me in my home ancestral county, was being asked in his comfort zone man cave, around his family and not mine. **I realise then that he wanted to 'get it over with' so he could ease his own anxiety and we could go on our trip. Now it's starting to make sense. He chose his own comfort over something I liked.**

**It gets worse, and worse, and worse, for 3 days.**

**The Proposal Fallout in the Front Room:** I went to my front room to start packing. He came in and hugged me from behind. He said, *""I'm sorry it didn't go to plan. That's why I kept asking to delay the train, so I didn't have to do it when we were rushing."" I said 'X home county would have meant a lot to me,'*

But we didn’t *have* to. Why couldn’t he just wait? He was trying to delay the train because a morning rushed proposal wouldn't be good? So when I didn't delay the train, WHY DID HE CONTINUE WITH THE MORNING RUSHED PROPOSAL?????

Next thing, his dad and BROTHER—who, it turns out, was upstairs working from home—called down for my answer. So I didn’t even get a say in when I tell people. Two men? Not even his mother? Who’s gone out to the gym since she couldn’t walk the dog. They asked if I could come up to show the ring. I said, *""Well, I have to finish packing. I’ve just been proposed to with one sock on.""*

I was saying it jokingly, but I was also in shock. I had just been proposed to in the morning—*to an ADHD non-morning person girl who lives for the night.*

His dad grabbed me for a picture while we ran for the taxi and put it into THEIR family group chat before I could tell my own. I sat in the taxi, and the depression started to kick in. I felt like my soul had been torn.

*His best friend brought his girlfriend to Mexico once on his family trip. Everyone speculated that he would propose. I said to my partner, 'ah no, your friend isn't that stupid. He's way more tuned in that than. He knows you should do it around her family, not the guy's.' And my partner did it around his family, and just the guys. His dad grabbed me for picture while we ran for the taxi and put it into THEIR family group chat before I could tell my own. I sat in the taxi, and the depressed started to kick in. I felt like my soul had been torn.*

**The Train Station:** He went to get food in the shop. I sat and watched the bags in disbelief. *That was it?* After all that build-up? A four-hour train journey away from everything that meant everything to me. He couldn’t wait? I have a permanently downturned smile. I got Botox to upturn it a few weeks before. I felt the muscles in my mouth pulling down like they had cement bricks hanging from them. I was so deflated. Now I had to sit next to him on the train for four hours.

He saw this. He came out of the store.

*""You know, you don't have to say yes.""*  
*""What?""* I asked.  
*""You look like you want to die.""*  
*""We were rushing for a train, X,""* I said.

So he knew now that I wasn't happy. I wanted to be, but I couldn't force it. He got on the phone on the train and started telling everyone I said yes. He handed the phone to his OTHER BROTHER without asking, and I had to fake happiness. He told me he'd been telling everyone—our friends, his colleagues. He even started messaging a CLIENT he met for ONE DAY at work about my saying yes. And apparently, not a single member of *my* family.

I started to realize that I couldn't go anywhere to cry for four hours. I had no privacy to discuss it with him. We were sat across from strangers everywhere. I felt trapped. He asked me why I wasn't telling anyone. I said, *""I'm tired. I just want to get there and tell my friends then. Then maybe I can feel like you did it there.""*

He tried to say, *""My brother was supposed to propose to my sister-in-law in a restaurant, but then the London riots happened and he had to do it at home. These things never go to plan.""*

Excuse me? Where were the riots on this occassion? This was all *your* plan. I told you five times it was just going to rain a bit on ONE DAY.

Eventually, I went to cry in a pissy train bathroom.

**The Hotel:** All I wanted to do was get to the room and sleep for the day. I couldn’t. His brother and friends had called ahead to tell the hotel we were engaged. Now we had to wait for something to be sent to our room, and I had to make up a happy story to the excited receptionist. She was lovely, and it was killing me to pretend to be happy.

We got to the room and his friends had ordered us prosecco. It was laid out—very thoughtful. He said, *""Aw wow, this is lovely, I should have done it here!""*

*Knife twist.*

Yep—I would have even accepted the hotel room in the home county at this stage. At least I’d be relaxed, at ease, in privacy, with a coffee and a drink. I started to realize that *I* booked the whole trip, his friends and brother organized the prosecco, and he screamed at his mum for an animal to be left in the room with us while he flung a wrapped ring box on the table—that was his contribution.

We sat in front of the alcohol that I couldn't wait to drown my sorrows in, and without even settling in, he told a tired me to ring my parents. I held off. He asked again. I was too exhausted to fight it. I told them. They told all my family, and now I was dealing with the calls and texts that I wanted to deal with when I was happy.

He knew my dad had been down there the week before and had mentioned we should invite him for dinner. I had called my dad to invite him the week before, but he said he was coming back up to our other home. We called my parents with the news and my dad said, *""Well, if I'd have known, I would have stayed down.""*

This broke me. He told even some random client he met once, and not my parents—in *their* home county. I could have had some comfort or a shoulder to cry on.

**Sleepless Rage**

We finally agreed to sleep. I couldn’t. The ambush of the morning kept flooding my head to the point where my body was jerking with rage and anxiety. His family upstairs. His family announcing it on my behalf. My lack of sleep. The four-hour tin can train journey for my undiagnosed autistic boyfriend who loves trains while I hate them. Holding in my tears for four hours on public transport.

I left the room. He asked where I was going. I said, *""I'm too upset about how it's all gone down this morning.""*

I called my mother to tell her everything. She was horrified. Said he was *""a child""* and asked, *""Do you want to be married to that forever? He's never going to improve.""*

I came back to the room, so calm, so quiet. He asked what was up. I said, *""I need to talk about this morning.""*

He threw his clothes on in a fit and said, *""This whole fucking thing has been a waste of time.""*

I looked at him, too tired to address the comment. He left the room.

He came back and said he talked it out with his brother. He had been hyperventilating about it. His brother said, *""It's fine, you can re-do it.""*

I didn't want him to be upset, so I decided I was going to try my best to enjoy the weekend. He did too. We got drunk. We argued a bit later and he said, *""You're making it all about you. What about me? I'm humiliated.""*

I asked, *""Was this all not your plan? And for one day in our entire lives, is it not actually supposed to be about me?""* This flabbergasted him.

**The Day at the Georgian Grounds:**

I woke up to the horrible morning memories replaying again. As I had been the whole trip, I let him sleep and disappeared into the bathroom to quiertly cry. I then started writing gratitude things in my diary to try to convince myself I was happy for the trip. Things like, *""I'm going to have a great day today. I'm going to enjoy this place. I'm going to have a great day in this Georgian house.""*

The memories and angry thoughts just kept flooding in and upsetting me and I fought them off.

I remembered his brother said he *""could re-do it.""* I imagined he was going to bring the ring to the Georgian grounds today and re-do it there. ***NEWS FLASH FOR ANYONE WITH THE SLIGHTEST PATTERN RECOGNITION—HE DOESN'T!***

**And he somehow** ***MAKES IT WORSE.***

I told myself all morning, *""I'll enjoy these Georgian grounds of my childhood. I'll still enjoy my trip.""* It was, of course, *not* raining and beautifully sunny when we got there. He was really impressed by the beauty and said, ***""Wow, this is stunning. If I'd have known this was so nice I would have done it here.""***

***KNIFE TWIST.***

How much thought had he actually put in at all? I, so, so, so deflated at this stage, in almost a whisper, said, *""Anywhere in X county would have meant a lot to me.""*

**He joked,** ***""Well, I like how I proposed, so fuck you.""***

I broke my hand away from his. He grabbed it again. I broke it away. He said, *""Oh are you not talking to me now?""*

I felt trapped by him for the weekend. He’s bigger than me. We went on the tour. I walked ahead of him and went into the different rooms of the house. He caught up at one stage. *""Are we not supposed to be doing this together?""* I sucked it up so he could send pictures to his mother.

HE ALSO MADE SEVERAL COMMENTS ABOUT HOW GREAT IT WAS THAT WE HAVE A CLEAN HOUSE TO GO BACK TTO NOW BECAUSE HE CLEANED IT. HE CLEANED HIS OWN FILTH FOR MY PROPSAL. OOH LAH DEE DAH. HE ACTUALLY WANTED CREDIT FOR THAT. VOMIT.

We went back to the hotel. I needed a drink.

**Instagram Pressure & Emotional Collapse:** This is when he decided it was time for me to tell my friends. I said, *""OK, I'll do a private stories announcement.""*

He said, *""Why won't you do a public one?""*

This guy *hates* public Instagram stuff. He said he felt like my ""dirty little secret"" if I didn’t tell my friends.

Let me remind you—he knew how upset I was about everything and had stormed out the night before rather than talk about it.

I said, *""I still haven't slept properly. I want to tell people when I feel good about it. We've been rushing for trains, rushing for breakfast, rushing to the Georgian grounds. I want to feel good. I want to feel calm. That's how a proposal should be.""*

This was just after we got back from the place where we didn’t have a picnic and he didn’t redo it.

So I announced it, after he guilted me more. Now I had to filter through happy friends’ questions when I wasn't happy—after my fiancé had just said *""I liked how I proposed so fuck you""* and ruined the memory of that place for me too.

Every time I was away from him, the ambush of the morning filled my head again—and I had a drink. I disappeared into our ensuite, public toilets, around corners—to cry.

**The Final Night and Drive Away:**

On the last night, it all came out. I couldn't hold the tears in anymore and cried for an hour in the room while he was sleeping. Not in the bathroom. I was sick of bathrooms. He woke up and said, *""Just tell me what's wrong.""*

We came to realize that he thought I was just some princess who *""didn't get the location she wanted.""* He didn’t put it like that, but that was the sentiment.

I had to ask if there was *any other reason* he thought I might be sad?

HE HAD NO CLUE.

I explained:

* He built up a picture in my head of something beautiful that he'd never even spent a second planning.
* He proposed in a mood after yelling at his mum. I hate when he yells at his mum.
* He did it with *his* family and not mine.
* I hadn’t slept, eaten, or had coffee.
* I’m not a morning person.
* I was rushing for a train.
* It  is a life changing question.
* He wanted to get it over with.
* He did it in a room I've never spent a second in- his filthy man cave.
* He didn’t even unwrap the box and aggressively grabbed it out of my hands.
* He only cleaned his filth for a one-off proposal.
* His family ambushed me and took away my choice to tell people first.
* He guilted made me tell everyone else when I wasn’t ready. Now people in my job would know.
* He wanted credit all weekend for cleaning up his filth.
* He twisted the knife in the hotel room and ruined the day at the Georgian castle by being a dick.
* He had all weekend to redo it—and I was realizing that was never going to happen.
* This is my engagement story for the rest of my life.

But worse: *yet again*, for my own proposal, *I* organized everything. I picked the meaningful hotel, location, did all the booking—**I HANDED HIM MY PERFECT PROPOSAL ON A PLATTER—THE ONE HE PAINTED FOR ME—AND HE COULDN'T WAIT FOUR HOURS TO DO IT, AND DID THE WORST POSSIBLE THING INSTEAD.**

He said, *""There. Do you feel better now?""*

What a condescending prick.

**The Escape:**

I woke up at 5 a.m back home the next day after our train journey because I had taken time off I couldn’t afford and needed to review some work.

What was the first thing that greeted me? A company announcement on Slack—of a guy from my job, who was from the same home county, who had set up a camera on the beach just 40 minutes away from me, and proposed to his girlfriend on the beach. *""What a thoughtful proposal,""* the Slack message said to the company. It almost felt like a sign.

I couldn’t take anymore. I packed my bags. I woke him up and said, *""I don’t want you waking up to me disappeared. I just need to get out of here. I can’t be in this house where it happened.""*

I drove home at 6 a.m. and made it to my WFH laptop by 8 a.m. at my parents'. I cried for a week straight in between meetings, after holding it in all weekend.

He asked when I was coming home. I said I needed to be in my own place to cry because I was crying *every day.*

He said I should see a doctor because *""that’s not normal.""* He started recommending SSRIs.

I said I was crying because of a situation *he put me in*—and that I was having a valid reaction.

When I asked why he was so happy to sit and tell people on the train when he *knew* I didn’t want to and *""looked like I wanted to die,""* he said it was *""damage control.""*

*For who? His ego? Looking good to his work friends? What about me?*

I went off on him in angry voicenotes after feeling sane and hearing my parents' reactions.

He sent flowers apologising.

  
Everything is just throwing money at stuff and not wanting to actually talk.

**The Aftermath:** He said he’d make it up to me with a *""nice planned day to pick the real ring.""* His whole family knew now, so I felt tainted—I couldn’t go into new relationships *""having been engaged.""* His parents were expecting it. But mainly, I went back to him because I *could not* leave my animals.

I finally got him to agree to hear me out a few weeks later when I was still ruming to myself and unable to overcome it. He said talking about serious things is 'hell' for him. I said not talking made me hold it all in, made it build up, made me resent him.

  
I said I resented him. 

  
Everytone kept asking about the wedding- his parents, mum, family, my family, our friends organised a happy engagement party- it was all spiralling out of control. I WOULD HAVE ENTHUSIASTICALLY SAID YES if he had planned that picnic and FOR ONCE did what he said he was going to do WITHOUT BEING DRAGGED KICKING AND SCREAMING TO HIS OWN PLANS.



I put my head in the sand and tried to plan the wedding everyone had been told about before I was ready, after all my aunties, uncles, and cousins asked when the big day was.

He did plan a nice day. We picked a lovely ring.

Then came the wedding rules:

* Nowhere with the prices displayed on the website
* Nowhere where people try to look like they’re rich
* Nowhere too expensive
* *Making people travel for no reason is tacky—it must be the home county as a reason.*

I did all the research again, even traveled back to the home county to trial a hotel stay for him. I thought he’d like it. I asked him to come down the next weekend to see for himself because they only had one summer weekend left. I wanted to make sure HE approved.

Our friends were having a BBQ, so he didn’t want to go to see the hotel. Next summer was too early. He wanted it in two years.

The *one* thing I said I wanted was *not* to have it in two years. That’s March. Rainy. Dull. Flu season. Hectic time in work. The following summer would be 2.5 years away. Too long. I’d be 37. I asked, \*""Can I please just have it next summer?""

He responded again: *""You're making it all about you.""*

*How can I even enjoy my wedding day now when I think if I get one thing my way he'll be thinking I'm a self-absorbed brat?*

*He also keeps blaming the fact that I went back on the pill, missed a day, and doubled up twoo days before the proposal.*

*I feel gaslit. I feel invalidated. I feel like I'm losing my mind.*

I cannot get over it. I cannot get over this proposal. I cannot get over the build-up and the letdown. He’s a walking anti-climax to me now. He’s a victim of his own planning. He blames me for holding him accountable. I cannot get over this princess I’m planning a wedding for—and planned my own proposal for. And if I ask for one tiny thing? *""It’s all about me.""*

My issue is very much the anxiety and 30 seconds of adrenaline led panic in the lead up and start of presenting, or speaking in a group, or even just a meeting. I’ve posted on this more specifically a few times so i won’t labour the details again, suffice to say I’ve suffered this all my life (52) but somehow managed to carve out something of a career!

It is very specifically in situations when i know i am going to be called to speak. and is always worst when its about/presenting myself. Yesterday i chaired a day of meetings at a company i am consulting, completely fine, because i controlled the agenda, format and process- its only when i am put on the spot by someone else,
or i think i am about to be. Somehow i have never had a complete meltdown and had to leave the room, but my god i’ve come close a few times

Coffee is clearly not a great idea but oddly i have
never really tried giving up.. i’m pretty addicted to my early morning cup and generally any speaking situations are a few hours later so i don’t really think it will help. Have any others had any luck with this? can it make
a big difference, 

Tiredness is a big factor for me, i can frequently get through a day in pretty good shape but become
more anxious and panicky in the later meetings.. again would be interested to hear how much this impacts
others 

Would love to hear from others what makes
things worse and what makes things better?

# 🔍 What Led Me to Try MITOLYN?

For the past few years, I’ve felt like I was losing control over my energy and health. I’m in my early 40s, but my body felt like it was much older. I was constantly exhausted, mentally foggy, and even simple tasks like walking up the stairs drained me. Doctors told me everything was “normal,” but deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.

Then I heard about **MITOLYN** from a friend who looked more vibrant and energized than I’d seen her in years. She swore by it, calling it her “cellular reset button.” I did some research and saw rave reviews — real people claiming their vitality and mental clarity returned. That’s when I decided to give it a shot.

# ⚙️ What Is MITOLYN?

**MITOLYN** is a **cellular energy supplement** that supports mitochondrial health — the powerhouses of your cells. As we age, our mitochondria degrade, leading to fatigue, slower metabolism, poor focus, and a weakened immune system.

MITOLYN contains a unique formula of ingredients like **NTFactor® Lipids**, **CoQ10**, **Acetyl-L-Carnitine**, and essential antioxidants that repair and replenish mitochondrial membranes. The result? **More energy, better brain function, enhanced endurance, and youthful vitality**.

# 💥 What Happened When I Took MITOLYN?

I started noticing changes within the **first week** — not huge at first, but subtle things like waking up more refreshed and not needing my third coffee of the day. By **week two**, the brain fog that had been plaguing me for months started to lift. I could think clearly again, and my productivity at work improved drastically.

But the **real breakthrough came in the third week**. I started going for morning walks again, something I hadn’t done in over a year. My energy levels were steady throughout the day, without the crashes I used to experience. Even my sleep improved — deeper, more restful, and without waking up multiple times.

And it wasn’t just me who noticed.

>

I was glowing. And it was all because of MITOLYN.

# 🌿 Why MITOLYN Works When Other Supplements Fail

Unlike generic energy boosters or multivitamins, MITOLYN works at the **cellular level**. It doesn’t just mask fatigue — it **repairs your cells from the inside out**. Its science-backed formula addresses **mitochondrial dysfunction**, which is at the root of most aging-related issues.

Most people don’t realize that the reason they’re tired, forgetful, or constantly getting sick isn’t just aging — it’s because their cells are struggling to produce energy efficiently.

**MITOLYN fixes that.**

# 🧪 Ingredients You Can Trust

What impressed me most was MITOLYN’s transparent and clinically-supported ingredients:

* **NTFactor® Lipids** – Restores damaged mitochondrial membranes.
* **CoQ10** – Enhances energy production and acts as a powerful antioxidant.
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Supports brain function and energy metabolism.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – Fights oxidative stress and inflammation.
* **NADH & B Vitamins** – Essential for cellular energy and focus.

These aren’t filler ingredients — they are **purposefully combined for maximum impact**, and you feel the difference.

# 🚫 Any Side Effects?

None. Absolutely none. I was concerned about stomach issues or jitters (which I’ve experienced with other supplements), but MITOLYN is **gentle, clean, and effective**. I’ve had **zero side effects** — only improvements.

# 👩‍⚕️ Who Should Try MITOLYN?

* If you’re **constantly tired** for no clear reason.
* If you have **brain fog**, memory lapses, or lack mental clarity.
* If you want to feel **young, energized, and vibrant** again.
* If you’re looking to **improve your immune system**, sleep, or mood.
* If you’re recovering from **chronic fatigue, illness, or burnout**.

MITOLYN isn’t just for the elderly or chronically ill — it’s for **anyone who values their long-term health and energy.**

# 💸 Is MITOLYN Worth the Price?

Absolutely. When I think about how much I’ve spent on coffee, quick fixes, or doctor visits trying to “solve” my exhaustion — MITOLYN is actually a **huge money-saver**. Plus, it’s backed by real science and has been used by thousands with life-changing results.

You’re not just buying a bottle — you’re **investing in your future, your energy, and your quality of life**.

# 📦 Final Thoughts: Should You Try MITOLYN?

YES — without hesitation.

I rarely write reviews, and I’m even more cautious about recommending health products. But MITOLYN is different. It gave me back my clarity, my energy, and my confidence. It helped me **feel like myself again**.

If you’re tired of feeling tired… if you miss the energy you used to have… if you’re ready to take control of your health — then please do yourself a favor and **give MITOLYN a chance**.

# 🔍 What Led Me to Try MITOLYN?

For the past few years, I’ve felt like I was losing control over my energy and health. I’m in my early 40s, but my body felt like it was much older. I was constantly exhausted, mentally foggy, and even simple tasks like walking up the stairs drained me. Doctors told me everything was “normal,” but deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.

Then I heard about **MITOLYN** from a friend who looked more vibrant and energized than I’d seen her in years. She swore by it, calling it her “cellular reset button.” I did some research and saw rave reviews — real people claiming their vitality and mental clarity returned. That’s when I decided to give it a shot.

# ⚙️ What Is MITOLYN?

**MITOLYN** is a **cellular energy supplement** that supports mitochondrial health — the powerhouses of your cells. As we age, our mitochondria degrade, leading to fatigue, slower metabolism, poor focus, and a weakened immune system.

MITOLYN contains a unique formula of ingredients like **NTFactor® Lipids**, **CoQ10**, **Acetyl-L-Carnitine**, and essential antioxidants that repair and replenish mitochondrial membranes. The result? **More energy, better brain function, enhanced endurance, and youthful vitality**.

# 💥 What Happened When I Took MITOLYN?

I started noticing changes within the **first week** — not huge at first, but subtle things like waking up more refreshed and not needing my third coffee of the day. By **week two**, the brain fog that had been plaguing me for months started to lift. I could think clearly again, and my productivity at work improved drastically.

But the **real breakthrough came in the third week**. I started going for morning walks again, something I hadn’t done in over a year.

# 🚨 My Health Was Declining Fast – And I Didn’t Know Why

A few years ago, I started experiencing strange symptoms: constant bloating, occasional constipation, sugar cravings that felt uncontrollable, low energy even after a full night's sleep, and my focus was shot. I was gaining weight without changing my diet. Doctors ran tests — but everything came back “normal.”

But I knew something was off.

I started researching gut health and came across a term that kept popping up: **""Leaky Gut""** and **""Microbiome Imbalance.""** That's when I realized — my gut was the root of everything.

# 🧪 What is PrimeBiome?

**PrimeBiome** is a premium, science-backed **probiotic supplement** designed to restore gut balance, boost immunity, eliminate bloating, and improve overall digestion. But unlike cheap probiotics you find in supermarkets, **PrimeBiome contains potent strains that actually survive stomach acid and reach your gut where they’re needed most.**

It’s not just about digestion — your gut health affects your brain, skin, weight, and even mood. That’s why PrimeBiome is formulated not just to fix gut issues but to upgrade your entire body from the inside out.

# 🌟 Why I Chose PrimeBiome Over Other Brands

I tried many probiotics before this — they either did nothing or gave me side effects. But PrimeBiome was different. Here’s what stood out:

# ✅ Clinically Researched Strains

Each capsule contains **high CFUs (colony-forming units)** and clinically studied strains like *Lactobacillus acidophilus*, *Bifidobacterium lactis*, and others proven to improve gut flora.

# ✅ Delayed-Release Capsule

The probiotic strains are protected by a delayed-release system that ensures they survive stomach acid and reach the intestines intact. Most cheaper brands dissolve in the stomach and are useless.

# ✅ No Fillers, No BS

It’s gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, non-GMO, and contains zero artificial ingredients. It’s everything I wanted and nothing I didn’t.

# 💥 My Results After 30, 60, and 90 Days

# 📆 First 7 Days: Subtle Shifts

* Less bloating after meals
* Improved bowel movements
* Slight energy boost in the mornings

# 📆 30 Days: Clear Signs of Progress

* Bloating was **gone**
* My cravings for sugar reduced dramatically
* I was waking up **refreshed**
* My focus at work was sharper

# 📆 60 Days: People Noticed

* My skin was glowing
* I lost 8 pounds **without dieting**
* Mood swings were rare
* I even noticed less inflammation in my joints

# 📆 90 Days: Life-Changing

* I felt **years younger**
* I stopped needing naps during the day
* Digestion was smooth and consistent
* My confidence and self-esteem soared

# 🛡️ PrimeBiome Isn’t Just a Supplement – It’s an Investment in Your Health

Let’s be honest: there are thousands of probiotic products out there. Most are cheap garbage with little scientific backing. But PrimeBiome is different. It's doctor-formulated, third-party tested, and made in a GMP-certified facility in the USA. You can feel the **quality** from the first dose.

It’s more than just a probiotic. It’s a **gut restoration system**.

# 💬 Real Talk: Is PrimeBiome Worth It?

I get this question a lot from friends and coworkers who see the change in me.

My answer? **Absolutely.**

Think about how much you spend on coffee, takeout, or skincare trying to “feel better.” Now imagine one supplement that actually helps you **feel amazing** — from the inside out.

And let’s not forget: your gut is connected to nearly **everything** in your body. If you don’t fix that, no energy drink, detox tea, or fitness plan will ever give lasting results.

# ❓ Still On the Fence? Read This

If you’re worried about side effects — I had **zero.** No nausea, no weird feelings — nothing. It’s gentle but effective.

If you’re skeptical because you’ve “tried everything” — I hear you. But trust me, **PrimeBiome is different.** You’ll feel it.

And if you’re afraid of wasting money — they offer a **100% money-back guarantee.** That’s how confident they are that it works.

# 📦 Pro Tips Before You Order

* **Order at least 3 bottles** — gut healing takes time, and most people feel real results around week 4.
* **Take it on an empty stomach**, preferably in the morning with a full glass of water.
* **Drink more water** and cut back on sugar while you take it — this boosts its effectiveness.",1,1747326843.0,JimGaffigan,2,1.0,False

# ✅ Delayed-Release Capsule

The probiotic strains are protected by a delayed-release system that ensures they survive stomach acid and reach the intestines intact. Most cheaper brands dissolve in the stomach and are useless.

# ✅ No Fillers, No BS

It’s gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, non-GMO, and contains zero artificial ingredients. It’s everything I wanted and nothing I didn’t.

# 🛡️ PrimeBiome Isn’t Just a Supplement – It’s an Investment in Your Health

Let’s be honest: there are thousands of probiotic products out there. Most are cheap garbage with little scientific backing. But PrimeBiome is different. It's doctor-formulated, third-party tested, and made in a GMP-certified facility in the USA. You can feel the quality from the first dose.

It’s more than just a probiotic. It’s a gut restoration system.

# 💬 Real Talk: Is PrimeBiome Worth It?

I get this question a lot from friends and coworkers who see the change in me.

My answer? Absolutely.

Think about how much you spend on coffee, takeout, or skincare trying to “feel better.” Now imagine one supplement that actually helps you feel amazing — from the inside out.

And let’s not forget: your gut is connected to nearly everything in your body. If you don’t fix that, no energy drink, detox tea, or fitness plan will ever give lasting results.

# ❓ Still On the Fence? Read This

If you’re worried about side effects — I had zero. No nausea, no weird feelings — nothing. It’s gentle but effective.

If you’re skeptical because you’ve “tried everything” — I hear you. But trust me, PrimeBiome is different. You’ll feel it.

And if you’re afraid of wasting money — they offer a 100% money-back guarantee. That’s how confident they are that it works.

# 📦 Pro Tips Before You Order

* Order at least 3 bottles — gut healing takes time, and most people feel real results around week 4.
* Take it on an empty stomach, preferably in the morning with a full glass of water.
* Drink more water and cut back on sugar while you take it — this boosts its effectiveness.",1,1747326813.0,JimGaffigan,2,1.0,False

# 🚨 My Health Was Declining Fast – And I Didn’t Know Why

A few years ago, I started experiencing strange symptoms: constant bloating, occasional constipation, sugar cravings that felt uncontrollable, low energy even after a full night's sleep, and my focus was shot. I was gaining weight without changing my diet. Doctors ran tests — but everything came back “normal.”

But I knew something was off.

I started researching gut health and came across a term that kept popping up: **""Leaky Gut""** and **""Microbiome Imbalance.""** That's when I realized — my gut was the root of everything.

1kncmer,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschoolcanada/comments/1kncmer/3l_with_nothing_to_show_advice_on_next_steps/,3L with nothing to show -Advice on next steps,"Slightly over a B average. Over 80 job applications (all areas and sizes of law firms) and nothing in 1L, 2L or 3L.  Rejected from the student societies I applied to, clerkship, bar review, internships, volunteer opportunities, competitive moots. I re applied every year to these and was rejected again and again. Couldn't even convince someone to let me work for them for free. 

 Still unemployed, studying for Bar/Sol and still making articling applications, and reviewing with career center (although I have heard it all and my resumes and cover letters are to their liking). I spend around 10- 15 hours every week, since 1L recruits started, searching and applying to places.

I have cold called, coffee chatted, attended socials and networking events. I spent so much time on this crap. 

 I have decent social skills and have made it to the final stages of interviews at a bay street firm and another large toronto firm, but ultimately was not hired. I have 7 years work experience in manual labour, which is sometimes a pro and sometimes a huge con with employers. 

 Now I just finished with my final semesters grades all over the place including two C's (my worst performance yet and bringing the total to 4 C's). Which seem like the final nails in the coffin. This is obviously connected to the stress of failing to secure employment constantly and facing rejection every other week since 1L. I feel like I am about to lose my mind. I don't know how I can keep doing this much work. 

 I ask employers what was wrong/weakness with my application etc. And they say the same things to me mostly. That I don't have enough A's (I have 3). And .....drum roll.....the fact I had to go to college to initially get into university is a huge blemish and places other candidates who did not need to take this step as more competitive. This profession is a joke. College was 10 years ago and I got an A average in my subsequent undergrad at the #1 university in the country. 

Anyone navigated this before? Do I just start not telling them about college in the interview (I removed it from my resume as per career center advice and got much more opportunities than when it was included), even when they ask about the gap college creates in my resume? Seems unethical for me, but also unethical to be rejected from employment due to attending college and working manual labour to pay for it.  Out of the 5 interviews I have secured, 3 mentioned college, and the other 2 mentioned college and a combination of lack of legal experience (societies in law school and employement) and manual labour jobs as a weakness. 

It's clear attending college prejudiced me in every application both to employers and for opportunities in law school. 

I don't want to do the LLP, but that is apparently where ppl who went to college will end up. Paying even more out of pocket.

Make an informed choice today!

MITOLYN Customer Review: The Life-Changing Supplement You’ve Been Waiting For! Let me start with a confession — I was skeptical. I’ve tried countless supplements over the years, all promising miracles but delivering disappointment. But MITOLYN? It completely changed my perspective on health, energy, and aging. I can confidently say this is not just another supplement. It’s a scientifically-backed breakthrough that actually works — and I’m here to tell you why I believe you need to try MITOLYN right now.

[**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://82019emc47rm7od6rrwjcj2u5d.hop.clickbank.net)

# 🔍 What Led Me to Try MITOLYN?

For the past few years, I’ve felt like I was losing control over my energy and health. I’m in my early 40s, but my body felt like it was much older. I was constantly exhausted, mentally foggy, and even simple tasks like walking up the stairs drained me. Doctors told me everything was “normal,” but deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.

Then I heard about **MITOLYN** from a friend who looked more vibrant and energized than I’d seen her in years. She swore by it, calling it her “cellular reset button.” I did some research and saw rave reviews — real people claiming their vitality and mental clarity returned. That’s when I decided to give it a shot.

# ⚙️ What Is MITOLYN?

**MITOLYN** is a **cellular energy supplement** that supports mitochondrial health — the powerhouses of your cells. As we age, our mitochondria degrade, leading to fatigue, slower metabolism, poor focus, and a weakened immune system.

MITOLYN contains a unique formula of ingredients like **NTFactor® Lipids**, **CoQ10**, **Acetyl-L-Carnitine**, and essential antioxidants that repair and replenish mitochondrial membranes. The result? **More energy, better brain function, enhanced endurance, and youthful vitality**.

# 💥 What Happened When I Took MITOLYN?

I started noticing changes within the **first week** — not huge at first, but subtle things like waking up more refreshed and not needing my third coffee of the day. By **week two**, the brain fog that had been plaguing me for months started to lift. I could think clearly again, and my productivity at work improved drastically.

But the **real breakthrough came in the third week**. I started going for morning walks again, something I hadn’t done in over a year. My energy levels were steady throughout the day, without the crashes I used to experience. Even my sleep improved — deeper, more restful, and without waking up multiple times.

And it wasn’t just me who noticed.

>

I was glowing. And it was all because of MITOLYN.

# 🌿 Why MITOLYN Works When Other Supplements Fail

Unlike generic energy boosters or multivitamins, MITOLYN works at the **cellular level**. It doesn’t just mask fatigue — it **repairs your cells from the inside out**. Its science-backed formula addresses **mitochondrial dysfunction**, which is at the root of most aging-related issues.

Most people don’t realize that the reason they’re tired, forgetful, or constantly getting sick isn’t just aging — it’s because their cells are struggling to produce energy efficiently.

**MITOLYN fixes that.**

# 🧪 Ingredients You Can Trust

What impressed me most was MITOLYN’s transparent and clinically-supported ingredients:

* **NTFactor® Lipids** – Restores damaged mitochondrial membranes.
* **CoQ10** – Enhances energy production and acts as a powerful antioxidant.
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Supports brain function and energy metabolism.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – Fights oxidative stress and inflammation.
* **NADH & B Vitamins** – Essential for cellular energy and focus.

These aren’t filler ingredients — they are **purposefully combined for maximum impact**, and you feel the difference.

# 🚫 Any Side Effects?

None. Absolutely none. I was concerned about stomach issues or jitters (which I’ve experienced with other supplements), but MITOLYN is **gentle, clean, and effective**. I’ve had **zero side effects** — only improvements.

# 👩‍⚕️ Who Should Try MITOLYN?

* If you’re **constantly tired** for no clear reason.
* If you have **brain fog**, memory lapses, or lack mental clarity.
* If you want to feel **young, energized, and vibrant** again.
* If you’re looking to **improve your immune system**, sleep, or mood.
* If you’re recovering from **chronic fatigue, illness, or burnout**.

MITOLYN isn’t just for the elderly or chronically ill — it’s for **anyone who values their long-term health and energy.**

# 💸 Is MITOLYN Worth the Price?

Absolutely. When I think about how much I’ve spent on coffee, quick fixes, or doctor visits trying to “solve” my exhaustion — MITOLYN is actually a **huge money-saver**. Plus, it’s backed by real science and has been used by thousands with life-changing results.

You’re not just buying a bottle — you’re **investing in your future, your energy, and your quality of life**.

# 📦 Final Thoughts: Should You Try MITOLYN?

# 🔍 What Led Me to Try MITOLYN?

For the past few years, I’ve felt like I was losing control over my energy and health. I’m in my early 40s, but my body felt like it was much older. I was constantly exhausted, mentally foggy, and even simple tasks like walking up the stairs drained me. Doctors told me everything was “normal,” but deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.

Then I heard about **MITOLYN** from a friend who looked more vibrant and energized than I’d seen her in years. She swore by it, calling it her “cellular reset button.” I did some research and saw rave reviews — real people claiming their vitality and mental clarity returned. That’s when I decided to give it a shot.

# ⚙️ What Is MITOLYN?

**MITOLYN** is a **cellular energy supplement** that supports mitochondrial health — the powerhouses of your cells. As we age, our mitochondria degrade, leading to fatigue, slower metabolism, poor focus, and a weakened immune system.

MITOLYN contains a unique formula of ingredients like **NTFactor® Lipids**, **CoQ10**, **Acetyl-L-Carnitine**, and essential antioxidants that repair and replenish mitochondrial membranes. The result? **More energy, better brain function, enhanced endurance, and youthful vitality**.

# 💥 What Happened When I Took MITOLYN?

I started noticing changes within the **first week** — not huge at first, but subtle things like waking up more refreshed and not needing my third coffee of the day. By **week two**, the brain fog that had been plaguing me for months started to lift. I could think clearly again, and my productivity at work improved drastically.

But the **real breakthrough came in the third week**. I started going for morning walks again, something I hadn’t done in over a year. My energy levels were steady throughout the day, without the crashes I used to experience. Even my sleep improved — deeper, more restful, and without waking up multiple times.

And it wasn’t just me who noticed.

I was glowing. And it was all because of MITOLYN.

# 🌿 Why MITOLYN Works When Other Supplements Fail

Unlike generic energy boosters or multivitamins, MITOLYN works at the **cellular level**. It doesn’t just mask fatigue — it **repairs your cells from the inside out**. Its science-backed formula addresses **mitochondrial dysfunction**, which is at the root of most aging-related issues.

Most people don’t realize that the reason they’re tired, forgetful, or constantly getting sick isn’t just aging — it’s because their cells are struggling to produce energy efficiently.

**MITOLYN fixes that.**

# 🧪 Ingredients You Can Trust

What impressed me most was MITOLYN’s transparent and clinically-supported ingredients:

* **NTFactor® Lipids** – Restores damaged mitochondrial membranes.
* **CoQ10** – Enhances energy production and acts as a powerful antioxidant.
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Supports brain function and energy metabolism.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – Fights oxidative stress and inflammation.
* **NADH & B Vitamins** – Essential for cellular energy and focus.

These aren’t filler ingredients — they are **purposefully combined for maximum impact**, and you feel the difference.

# 🚫 Any Side Effects?

None. Absolutely none. I was concerned about stomach issues or jitters (which I’ve experienced with other supplements), but MITOLYN is **gentle, clean, and effective**. I’ve had **zero side effects** — only improvements.

# 👩‍⚕️ Who Should Try MITOLYN?

* If you’re **constantly tired** for no clear reason.
* If you have **brain fog**, memory lapses, or lack mental clarity.
* If you want to feel **young, energized, and vibrant** again.
* If you’re looking to **improve your immune system**, sleep, or mood.
* If you’re recovering from **chronic fatigue, illness, or burnout**.

MITOLYN isn’t just for the elderly or chronically ill — it’s for **anyone who values their long-term health and energy.**

# 💸 Is MITOLYN Worth the Price?

Absolutely. When I think about how much I’ve spent on coffee, quick fixes, or doctor visits trying to “solve” my exhaustion — MITOLYN is actually a **huge money-saver**. Plus, it’s backed by real science and has been used by thousands with life-changing results.

You’re not just buying a bottle — you’re **investing in your future, your energy, and your quality of life**.

# 📦 Final Thoughts: Should You Try MITOLYN?

YES — without hesitation.

I rarely write reviews, and I’m even more cautious about recommending health products. But MITOLYN is different. It gave me back my clarity, my energy, and my confidence. It helped me **feel like myself again**.

If you’re tired of feeling tired… if you miss the energy you used to have… if you’re ready to take control of your health — then please do yourself a favor and **give MITOLYN a chance**.

I’m so sad that I don’t even know what to write in the body of this post. I’m just gonna ramble and see what happens. 

I’m 48. No kids. This is my first, real love. My mom died in January, two months after we got engaged. She was a wedding planner. (See post history.) I had decided I was going to be strong and plan this all myself because hiring a stranger when all my family members got to have my mom, feels really awful. 

I made the guest list. It’s 48 people. Six of those people are my guests. Six. Two besties and my closest cousin were supposed to be bridesmaids. Cousin lives across the country. Bffs live the next state over, but are not friends with each other. My history with the bffs since I moved here 20years ago is that it’s always been me visiting them, never them coming to see me and what my life is like now. I always have to kind of beg to get them to come. And even then, they won’t until I offer to pay their airfare. The last time one of my bffs visited, I paid for her plane ticket but she said she could only stay for 36 hours. I did it anyway because I was secretly desperate to spend time with her. 

It’s hard to make new friends at my age. That’s typical. I’ve spent the last two decades getting all my socialization from my career. I have acquaintances, but no one who knows me beyond work. I am a friendly, bubbly introvert. I keep to myself but when I’m engaged in a good conversation, I’m a good listener, and love learning about other people’s lives. And I’m very open about my own. I’ve “made a new friend” and exchanged numbers, only for them to ghost me and become someone who only Likes my Instagram posts. That’s the world today, I suppose. 

My fiancé has a friend group that he’s known since grade school. They’re all in a softball league. They have a group chat that he’s always giggling about, every day. They have an annual rafting trip. He’s an uncle to one of his friend’s kids. It’s like if the boys from *Stand By Me* all stayed friends though high school, went to college together and were in each others weddings. They are all awesome people. My fiancé is the last one to couple up / settle down. They’re so excited for him. 

I’m so envious. 


I should be having coffee over bridal magazines and wine watching *Bridesmaids* and *Bachelorette.* I should have someone helping me organize a shower, or a bachelorette party. I don’t have anyone to do those things. I’m starting to feel too old and stupid to even want them. 

The wedding book timeline says we should do engagement photos by the end of this month so yesterday my fiancé and got dressed up and brought the tripod to some pretty locations. We got some really good shots! When we got home I was excited to show them off but quickly realized that I didn’t have anyone to show them to (besides my dad who is out of the country this week). I hesitate to send anything to my bffs because every time I do it takes them days to respond, and it takes the excitement out of it for me. I was so excited when I found my dress but no one responded until I sent a second photo with a question mark. I’ve had to manage my expectations when it comes to their attention, and lower the bar when it comes to their involvement. 

I feel stupid being excited about wedding stuff now. It’s not a big deal to them. They’ve been there, done that decades ago. They say things that make me think we are all too old for me to expect the same energy from them that they got from me 20 years ago. 

Last night I looked at my photos and started to cry. I don’t have anyone to share them with. No one who knows my whole life journey, how much I struggled to stay alive at times, and how it’s especially wonderful that I have healed enough to be a healthy partner in a healthy relationship. No one to be proud of me. I thought about how the only person who was really, really excited for us was Billie, my mom. She was so thrilled. She loved my ring and oohed and aahhed over it. She would have framed these photos. She would be sending me lace samples and texting me constantly about decor ideas and the menu. She would have been showing me pictures from wedding she’d organized and even officiated.  
I went into the bedroom where her ashes are and “showed her” our photos.

Idk. Maybe it’s too soon after her passing. Maybe I’m too wrapped up in grief. My fiancé asked me softly if I was okay and I just started sobbing hard. I just feel so lonely. I don’t mean to seem ungrateful. I am going to be married to the love of my life. I thank the universe every single day for this relationship and our ability to keep it strong. So maybe we should just elope? Maybe just something with our remaining parents? I feel like throwing ~~the wedding book~~ my dream in the garbage.

Every step of planning this wedding seems to highlight how alone I have been for the last 20 years, and how unfair it is that my mom and I have been waiting for this for so long, and now she’s not here for it. I feel like my “bffs” should step up, in her absence. If either of their parents’ died, if they’re going through a divorce, or a sudden career change, if they got seriously sick or in a car accident and almost died, I have, and would be in my car so fast to get to them. And then afterwards, I would be so aware of every milestone following, knowing they’d could be bittersweet. I *show up for my friends.* Some of those things happened to me, and I endured them all by myself except for some “you’ll be okay” texts. Am I being irrationally entitled to expect the same kind of support that I give? Or do i need to keep managing my expectations…..? 

Sigh. I think we should elope. ",14,1747326419.0,weddingplanning,16,0.94,False

1kncg0b,https://i.redd.it/t701gs602z0f1.jpeg,NY State Swag and learning experience,"

So, a month into my new machine having gone through 3 bags of Lavazza for learning purposes I'm about to embark on a my first fresh bean journey.  

I was traveling by rail from NYC to upstate NY and accumulated beans as I went.  So much fun. 

So from the beach to the mountains:

Buddies Brick Blend - Picked up at Brothers on Rockaway Beach.  Roasted in Brooklyn. I had a cold brew - nice but a little fruity for me.  Ethioapia / Brazil blend. Not espresso specific.  

Birch Emma Blend - NYC - Picked up in Penn Station.  The Americano I had with these beans at the station was delicious.  

Capitol City Roasters Della Notte Blend - Albany.  The barista saw I was disappointed that none of the packaged coffees on display were for espresso so she nicely packed up a pound from her stock hence the brown paper bag.  She made me a refreshing iced Americano. 

Kru Espresso Vivace - Glens Falls - This place rocked.  Great sandwiches.  Delicious and strong cortado.  

A few things I've learned with my Lavazza run - Different beans may need very different grind settings.  Great learning experience!
Beans not labeled for espresso may be excellent for espresso.  For example I've enjoyed the Perfetta house blend more than the Top Class or Espresso beans.  I think my tastes are trending towards medium beans. 

Also the bell curve for a tasty drink is much narrower when the goal is a straight shot vs. a milk or sweetened drink.  

So with these bags I hope to learn to dial in dose, ratio, time, temperature and grind more efficiently.  I’ll add to the spreadsheet as I go through them. 

Any tips are welcome. 

Also - can anyone recommend a great source for learning the subtleties of tasting espresso?

The morning after my first dose, I had one of the worst migraines I’ve had in a very long time. Got that down to a bad headache with lots of Excedrin. I’ve been nauseous since that morning, can’t stand up straight without feeling like I’m about to pass out. 

Each night I’ve taken it, it’s been with plenty of food. I am on a low-carb diet (I call it Ket-ish because most stuff we eat has no/low carbs but I use sugar in drinks and coffee) if that matters at all. I drink lots of water.

Picked up the Gaggia Classic 2019 with the following add-ons:

* Single hole steam tip from Shades of Coffee
* 9 Bar Spring from Shades of Coffee
* Bottomless Portafilter from from Shades of Coffee
* Barista Pro Double Basket from Shades of Coffee
* Normcore 30lb tamper

I have a Baratza Virtuoso+ that I've been using for pour overs for years that I absolutely love. I decided to give the recalibration and stepless mod a try to see if it could get the grind size fine enough. ***It does not!*** The grind is definitely finer but it is not close enough or consistent enough for espresso.

I knew this was inevitable but I needed to learn for myself I guess.

\~\~\~  
So here's where I'm at - I'm in analysis paralysis and I need two things

A new Grinder:

* This can be espresso only.
* Would prefer electric over manual.
* Small footprint is a plus.
* Would prefer < $500
* I have seen reccs for DF64+ and the Niche Zero and I've also seen that the DF54 might be sufficient for most people. Truthfully I'm in analysis paralysis and I don't want to buy the wrong thing!! I've read the top 5 grinder reccs article and still can't parse through it.

A new scale: I've been using a baking scale for my pour overs and I love it but the thing is massive. Its time to get something smaller.

* Ideally works for pour overs and espresso

\~\~\~

If it helps - Here's an aside on beans and drinks I make.

I prefer fruit forward, light to medium roast beans. I will probably be buying the same beans and using them for both pour overs and espresso drinks. I lean towards, iced americanos in the summer and cappuccinos in the morning. Around 3pm I usually make a v60.

I am lucky to live very close to a number of great 3rd wave shops and buy fresh beans regularly, roast dates are usually within the last 7-20 days.

I've tried having them grind beans for me but I had no luck. My pull times were like 13seconds to a 1:2 output and occasionally I'm getting spray from the side of the portafilter.

\~\~\~

TLDR: Help this fool buy a grinder and scale for his Gaggia Classic Pro 2019?? Hoping to solve this problem for < $500 total can go a bit higher.",1,1747325837.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
