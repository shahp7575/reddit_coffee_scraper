He was charming, reckless, and unpredictable—the kind of guy who knew his way around trouble and didn’t seem to mind it. But this time felt different. It wasn’t just a few months; he was facing ten years. A decade behind bars, for possession of over a pound of cocaine. They said it was hidden in the trunk of his car, packed away as casually as groceries. 



It stung. He’d promised us he was clean, that his wild years were behind him. Even at Thanksgiving, he’d go out of his way to remind us all that he was on the straight and narrow. We’d had our doubts—old habits don’t vanish overnight, after all. But a pound? None of us had seen that coming. My uncle swore up and down the drugs weren’t his, said he was framed, that someone wanted to see him gone for good. But when we pressed him on it, he’d just clam up, muttering that spending a decade locked away was better than what ""they"" would do to him.



After he was sentenced, my mom called, her voice tight, asking if I could go to his place and sort through his things. It was typical family duty—the kind of thing I couldn’t turn down. I wasn’t close with him, but family ties run deep enough to leave you feeling responsible, even when you know you shouldn’t.



So, with him locked away for the next ten years, I volunteered to clear out his apartment, move his things to storage. I didn’t know why I was so eager, but maybe I felt like it was the least I could do. The place was a disaster, exactly as I expected. His kitchen cupboards were filled with thrift-store pots and pans, each one more scratched and mismatched than the last. I could see him at the stove, cigarette dangling from his lips, stirring whatever random meal he’d thrown together in those beat-up pans.



The living room was its own kind of graveyard. Ashtrays covered nearly every surface, filled with weeks’ worth of cigarette butts, and the walls were a deep, sickly yellow from years of constant smoke. Even the light switches had turned the same shade, crusted over from the nasty habit that had stained every inch of the place. It was clear he hadn’t cracked a window in years. I found myself running my fingers along the walls, almost wondering if the yellow residue would come off. It didn’t.



In one corner of the room was his pride and joy: a collection of *Star Trek* figurines and posters, lined up on a crooked shelf he’d likely hammered up himself. He’d been a fan for as long as I could remember, always rambling about episodes I’d never seen and characters I couldn’t name. Dozens of plastic figures with blank, determined stares watched me pack up their home, my uncle’s treasures boxed up and ready to be hidden away for who knew how long.



It took a few days, but I finally got the majority of the place packed. Three trips in my truck, hauling boxes and crates to the storage facility across town, until the apartment was stripped bare. The only things left were the stained carpet, the nicotine-coated walls, and the broken blinds barely hanging in the windows. There was no way he was getting his security deposit back; the damage was practically baked into the place. But it didn’t matter anymore.



As I sorted through the last of the kitchen, my hand brushed against something tucked away in the shadows of the cabinet. I pulled it out and found myself holding a small, leather-bound book. The cover was cracked and worn, the leather soft from age, with a faint smell of cigarette smoke clinging to it. The pages inside were yellowed, brittle, and marked with years of kitchen chaos—stains, smudges, and scribbled notes everywhere.



The entries were scattered, written down in no particular order, almost as if whoever kept this book had jotted recipes down the moment they’d been created, without thought of organization. As I skimmed the pages, a feeling crept over me that this book might have belonged to my grandfather. He was the one who’d brought the family together, year after year, with his homemade dishes. Every holiday felt anchored by the meals he’d cooked, recipes no one had ever been able to quite replicate. This book could very well hold the secrets to those meals, a piece of him that had somehow made its way into my uncle’s hands after my grandfather passed. And yet…



I couldn’t shake a strange sense of dread as I held it. The leather was cold against my hands, almost damp, and a chill worked its way through me as I turned the pages. It felt *wrong*, somehow, as if there was more in this book than family recipes.



Curious about the book’s origins, I brought it to my mom. She took one look at the looping handwriting on the yellowed pages and nodded, her face softening with recognition. ""This was your grandfather's,"" she said, almost reverently, tracing her fingers along the ink. She hadn’t seen it in years, and when I told her where I'd found it, a look of surprise flickered across her face. She had been searching for the book for ages and had never realized her brother had kept it all this time.  



As she flipped through the pages, nostalgia mingled with something else—maybe a touch of sadness or reverence. I could tell this book meant a lot to her, which only strengthened my resolve to preserve it. “Could I hang onto it a little longer?” I asked. “I want to scan it, make a digital copy for myself, so we don’t lose any of his recipes.”



My mom agreed without hesitation, grateful that I was taking the time to safeguard something she hadn’t known was still around. So I got to work. Over the next few weeks, in the gaps of my day-to-day life, I carefully scanned each page. I wasn’t too focused on the content itself, more concerned with making sure each recipe was clear and legible, and didn’t pay close attention to the strange ingredients and odd notes scattered throughout. My only goal was to make the text accessible, giving life to a digital copy that would be preserved indefinitely.



Once I finished, I spent a few hours merging the scanned images, piecing them together to create a seamless digital version. When it was finally done, I returned the original to my mom, feeling a strange mix of relief and satisfaction. The family recipes were now safe, and I thought that was the end of it. But that sense of unease I’d felt in the kitchen, holding that worn leather cover, lingered longer than I expected.



In the months that followed, I didn’t think much about the recipe book. Scanning it had been a small side project, the kind I’d meant to follow up on by actually cooking a few of my grandfather’s old dishes. But like so many side projects, I got wrapped up in other things and the book’s contents drifted to the back of my mind, filed away and forgotten.



Then Thanksgiving rolled around. I made my way to my parents’ place, expecting the usual—turkey, stuffing, and the familiar spread that had become tradition. When I got there, though, I noticed something different right away. A large bird sat in the middle of the table, roasted to perfection, but something about it didn’t look right. It was too small for a turkey, and its skin looked darker, almost rougher than the golden-brown I was used to.  



“Nice chicken,” I said, figuring they’d switched things up for a change. My mom just shook her head.



“It’s not a chicken,” she said quietly. “It’s a hen.”



I gave her a confused look. “What’s the difference?” I asked, half-laughing, expecting her to shrug it off with a quick explanation. Instead, she just stared at me, her eyes unfocused as if she were lost in thought. 



For a moment, her face seemed distant, almost blank, as though I’d asked a question she couldn’t quite place. Then, suddenly, she blinked, her gaze snapping back to me. “It’s just… what the recipe called for,” she said, a strange edge to her voice.



Something about it made the hair on my arms prickle, but I pushed the feeling aside, figuring she’d just been caught up in the cooking chaos. Yet, as I looked at the bird again, a small flicker of unease crept in, settling in the back of my mind like an itch I couldn’t scratch.



After dinner, I pulled my dad aside in the kitchen while my mom finished clearing the table. ""What’s the deal with Mom tonight?"" I asked, keeping my voice low. He just shrugged, brushing it off with a wave of his hand.



“You know how your mother is,” he said with a small smile, as though her strange excitement was just one of those quirks. He didn’t give it a second thought, already moving on.



But I couldn’t shake the weirdness. The whole meal had been… off. The hen, unlike anything we’d had before, was coated in a sweet-smelling sauce that seemed to have a faint hint of walnut to it, almost masking its pale, ashen hue. The bird lay on a bed of unfamiliar greens—probably some sort of garnish—alongside perfectly sliced parsnips and radishes that seemed too neatly arranged, like it was all meant to look a certain way. The whole thing was far too elaborate for my mom’s usual Thanksgiving style.



When she finally sat, she led us in saying grace, her voice soft and reverent. As she began cutting into the hen, a strange glint of excitement lit up her face, one I wasn’t used to seeing. She served it up, watching each of us intently as we took our first bites. I wasn’t sure what I expected, but as I brought a piece to my mouth, I could tell right away this wasn’t the usual Thanksgiving fare. The meat was tough—almost stringy—and didn’t pull apart easily, a far cry from the tender turkey or even chicken I was used to.



Mom kept glancing between my dad and me with a kind of eager glee, as though she were waiting for us to say something. It was unsettling, her eyes wide, as if she were waiting for us to uncover some hidden secret.



When I finally asked, “What’s got you so excited, Mom?” she just smiled, her expression softening.



“Oh, it’s just… this cookbook you found from Grandpa’s things. It’s like having a part of him here with every meal I make.” She spoke with a reverence I hadn’t heard in her voice for a long time, as though she were talking about more than just food.



I gave her a nod, trying to humor her. “Tastes good,” I said, hoping she’d ease up. “I enjoyed it.” But in truth, I wished we’d had a more familiar Thanksgiving dinner. The meal wasn’t exactly bad, but something tasted a little off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, and maybe I didn’t want to.



After we finished, I said my goodbyes and headed home, trying to shake the lingering sense of unease. My mom’s face, her excitement, kept replaying in my mind. And then there was the hen itself. Why a hen? Why the pale, ashen sauce? There was something almost ritualistic in the way she’d prepared it, a strange precision I’d never seen from her before.



The night stretched on, the questions gnawing at me, taking root in a way that wouldn’t let me rest.



When I got home, I couldn’t shake the weird feeling from dinner. I sat down at my desk, opening the scanned file I’d saved to my desktop months ago. The folder had been sitting there, untouched, and now that I finally had it open, I could see why I’d put it off. The handwriting was dense and intricate, almost a kind of calligraphy, each letter curling into the next. The words seemed to dance across the pages in a strange, whimsical flow. I had to squint, leaning closer to make sense of each line.



As I scrolled through the recipes, a chill ran down my spine. They had unsettling names, the kind that felt more like old spells than recipes. *Mother’s Last Supper Porridge*, *Binding Broth of Bone and Leaf*, *Elders’ Emberbread*, *Hollow Heart Soup with Mourning Onion*. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but I could almost feel a heaviness creeping into the room, the words themselves holding an eerie energy. 



Then, I found it—the recipe for the dish my mother had made tonight: *Ancestor’s Offering*. The recipe was titled in that same swirling calligraphy, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I read the description. It was for a Maple-Braised Hen with Black Walnut and Root Purée, though it didn’t sound like any recipe I’d ever seen. The instructions were worded strangely, written in a style that made it feel centuries old. Each ingredient was listed with specific purpose and detail, as though it held some secret power.



My eyes skimmed down to the meat. It specified a hen, not just any chicken. “The body must be that of a mother,” it read. I felt a shiver go through me, remembering the strange way my mom had insisted on using a hen, correcting me when I’d casually referred to it as chicken. 



The instructions continued, noting that the hen had to be served on a bed of Lamb’s lettuce—a type of honeysuckle, according to a quick Google search. And then, as I read further, a chill seeped into my bones. The recipe stated it must be served “just before the end of twilight, as dusk yields to night.” I thought back to dinner, and the way we’d all sat down just as the last of the sun’s light faded beyond the horizon.



But the final instruction was the worst part, and as I read it, my stomach twisted in revulsion. The recipe called for something it referred to as *Ancestor’s Salt*. The note at the bottom explained that this “salt” was a sprinkle of the ashes of “those who have returned to the earth,” with a warning to use it sparingly, as “each grain remembers the one who offered it.”



I sat back, cold sweat breaking out across my skin as I recalled the pale, ashen sauce coating the hen, the faint, sweet scent it gave off. My mind raced, piecing together what it implied. Had my mom actually used… ashes in the meal? Had she… used my grandfather’s ashes?



I tried to shake it off, to tell myself it was just some old folklore nonsense. But the image of her smiling face as she served us that meal, the gleam in her eyes, crept back into my mind. I felt my stomach churn, bile rising in my throat as the horrifying thought sank deeper.



A few days later, the gnawing unease had become impossible to ignore. I told myself I was probably just overreacting, that the weird details in the recipe were nothing more than some strange family tradition I didn’t understand. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that crept up every time I remembered that meal. So, I decided to call my mom. I planned it out, careful to come off as casual. The last thing I wanted was for her to think I was accusing her of something as insane as putting ashes in our food.



I asked about my dad, about her gardening, anything to warm her up a bit. Then I thanked her for the Thanksgiving dinner, even going so far as to say it was the best we’d had in years. When I finally brought up the recipe book, her voice brightened instantly.



“Oh, thank you again for finding it!” she said, sounding genuinely pleased. “I had no idea he’d cataloged so many wonderful recipes. I knew your grandfather’s cooking was special, but to have all these dishes recorded, like his own little legacy—it’s been such a joy.”



I chuckled, trying to keep my tone light. “I actually looked up that dish you made us, *Ancestor’s Offering*. Thought maybe I’d give it a try myself sometime.” 



“Oh, really?” she replied, sounding intrigued.



“Yeah, though I thought it was a little strange the recipe specifically calls for a hen and not just a regular chicken, since they’re so much tougher. And the part that says it should be ‘the body of a mother’…” I let the words hang, hoping she’d jump in with some explanation that would make it all seem less… sinister.



For a moment, there was just silence on her end. Then, quietly, she said, “Well, that’s just how your grandfather wrote it, I suppose.” Her voice was different now, lower, as if she were carefully choosing her words.



My heart thumped in my chest, and I decided to press a little further. “I also noticed it calls for something called *Ancestor’s Salt*,” I said, feigning confusion, pretending I hadn’t read the footnote that explicitly described it. “What’s that supposed to be?”



The silence was even longer this time, stretching out until it became a ringing hum in my ears. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely a whisper.



“I… I have to go,” she murmured, sounding almost dazed.



Before I could respond, the line clicked, leaving me in the heavy, stunned quiet. I tried calling her back immediately, but it went straight to voicemail. Her phone was off.



My stomach twisted as I stared at the blank screen. I couldn’t tell if I was more scared of what I might find out or of what I might already know.



I hesitated, but eventually called my dad’s phone, feeling a need to at least check in. When he picked up, I told him about my call with Mom and how strange she’d been acting.



“She went into her garden right after you two spoke,” he said, sounding unconcerned. “Started tending to her plants, hasn’t said a word since.”



I tried nudging him a bit, asking if he could maybe get her to talk to me, but he just brushed it off. “You’re overreacting. You know how your mother is—gets all sentimental over family things. It’ll just upset her if you keep nagging her about it. Give her some space.”



I nodded, trying to take his advice to heart. “Yeah… alright. You’re probably right.”



After we hung up, I resolved to let it go and went about my day, chalking it up to my mom’s usual habit of getting overly attached to anything with sentimental value. She’d always treated family heirlooms like they carried something sacred, almost magical. But this time, I couldn’t fully shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, something that made it impossible to forget about that recipe book.



Eventually, curiosity got the better of me. Sitting back down at my computer, I opened the digital copy and scrolled aimlessly through the pages. Part of me knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t resist. I let the file skip down to a random section, thinking I’d try making something small, something harmless. As I scrolled, I found myself staring at the very last page, which held a recipe titled *Elders’ Emberbread*.



The instructions were minimal, yet each word seemed heavy, steeped in purpose. Beneath the title, a note read: “Best served in small portions on cold, dark nights. The taste is best enjoyed alone—lest the voices of the past linger too long.” 



I shook my head, half-amused, half-unnerved. It was all nonsense, I told myself, probably just some old superstitions my grandfather had picked up along the way. But something about it had my heart pounding just a bit harder. Ignoring the rising chill, I printed the recipe and took it to the kitchen. I’d play along, I figured. It was just bread, after all.



I scanned the list of ingredients for *Elders’ Emberbread*, feeling time slip away as though I’d been pulled into some strange trance. My mind blurred over, details of the process fading into a fog, yet I couldn’t stop moving. I gathered everything without really thinking about it, each step drawing me deeper, as though I were following some ancient, well-worn path. I remembered flashes—the sweet scent of elderberry and honey, the earthy weight of raw rye, the dry, pungent aroma of wood burnt to charcoal. At some point, I murmured something under my breath, words of thanks to my ancestors that I hadn’t consciously decided to speak.



The smell of warmed goat’s milk lingered in the air, blending with a creamy, thick butter that had blackened over low heat. A faint scent of yew ash drifted up as I worked, curling into my nose like smoke from an unseen fire.



By the time I came to my senses, night had fallen, the kitchen shadowed and still. And there, sitting on the counter, was the bread: a dark, dense loaf, blackened at the crust but glistening with an almost unnatural sheen. It looked rich and moist, and as I stared at it, a strange sense of pride swelled up within me, unnatural and unsettling, like a voice in the back of my mind was urging me to feel pleased, insisting that I’d done well.



Without really thinking, I cut myself a slice and carried it to the living room, feeling compelled to “enjoy” my creation. I took a bite, and the bread filled my mouth with an earthy, bittersweet taste, smoky yet tinged with a subtle berry sweetness. It was… unusual, nothing like I’d ever tasted before, but it was oddly satisfying. 



As I chewed, a warmth bloomed deep in my chest, spreading through me like the steady heat of a wood stove. It was comforting, almost intimate, as if the bread itself were warming me from the inside out. Before I knew it, I’d finished the entire slice. Not because I’d particularly enjoyed it, but because some strange sense of obligation had pushed me to finish every bite.



When I set the plate down, the warmth remained, a heavy presence settled deep inside me. And in the silence that followed, I could have sworn I felt a faint, rhythmic beat—a heartbeat, steady and ancient, pulsing faintly beneath my skin.



Over the next few weeks, I found myself drawn back to the *Elders’ Emberbread* more often than I intended. I’d notice myself in the kitchen, knife in hand, halfway through slicing a thick piece from the loaf before even realizing I’d gotten up to do it. It was instinctive, almost as if some quiet impulse guided me back to it on those quiet, late nights.



Each time I took a bite, that same deep warmth would swell inside me, radiating outward like embers glowing from a steady fire. But unlike the hen my mother had made—a meal that left me with a lingering sense of discomfort—the Emberbread felt different. It was as though each bite carried something I couldn’t quite place, something familiar and almost affectionate, like a labor of love embedded into every grain.



The days blended together, but the questions didn’t go away. I tried to reach out to my mother several times, hoping she might open up about the recipe book, maybe explain why we both seemed so drawn to these strange meals. But each time I brought it up, she’d evade the question, either changing the subject or claiming she was too busy to talk.



She hadn’t invited me over for dinner since Thanksgiving, and the distance between us felt like a slow, widening gulf. Even my dad, when I’d asked about her, shrugged it off, saying she was “just going through a phase.” But the coldness in her responses, her repeated avoidance of the book, only made me more certain that there was something she wasn’t telling me.



Still, I kept returning to the Emberbread, feeling its subtle pull each time the sun set, as though I were being guided by something unseen. And each time I took a bite, it felt less like a meal and more like… communion, a quiet bond that was growing stronger with every piece I consumed.



After weeks of unanswered questions, I decided to reach out to my uncle at the prison. I was allowed to leave a message, so I kept it short—told him it was his nephew, wished him well, and let him know I’d left him a hundred bucks in commissary. The next day, he called me back, his voice scratchy over the line but appreciative.



“Hey, thanks for the cash,” he said with a short chuckle. “You know how it is in here—money makes things easier.”



We chatted for a bit, catching up. He’d been in and out of prison so often that I’d come to see it as his way of life. In his sixties now, he talked about his time behind bars with a kind of acceptance, almost relief. “By the time I’m out again, I’ll be an old man,” he said, almost amused. “It’s not the worst place to grow old.”



Then I took a breath and brought up the reason I’d called. “I don’t know if you remember, but when I was packing up your place, I found this old recipe book.” I hesitated, then quickly added, “I, uh, gave it to Mom. Thought she’d get a kick out of it.”



His response was immediate. The warm, casual tone in his voice shifted, growing cold and sharp. “Listen to me,” he said, each word weighted and deliberate. “If you have that book, you need to throw it into a fire.”



“What?” I stammered, caught off guard. “It’s just a cookbook.”



“It’s not ‘just a cookbook,’” he replied, his voice low, almost trembling. “That book… it brings out terrible things in people.” He paused, as though considering how much to say. “My father—your grandfather—he was into some dark stuff, stuff you don’t just find in the back of an old family recipe. And that book?” He took a breath. “That book wasn’t his. It belonged to *his* mother, your great-grandmother, passed down to him before he even knew what it was. My mother used to say those recipes were meant for desperate times.”



The gravity of his words settled into me, and I felt the weight of it all suddenly make sense.



“They were used to survive hard times,” he continued, voice quiet. “You’ve heard about what people did during the Great Depression, how desperate families were… but this?” He exhaled sharply. “Those recipes are ancient. Passed down through whispers and word of mouth long before they were ever written down. But they’re not for everyday meals. They’re for… invoking things, bringing things out. The kind of things that can take hold of you if you’re not careful.”



My hand tightened around the phone as a cold shiver traced down my spine, my mind flashing back to the Emberbread, the warmth it had left in my chest, the strange satisfaction that hadn’t felt entirely my own.



“Promise me,” he continued, his voice almost pleading. “Don’t let Mom or anyone else use that book for anything casual. Those recipes can keep a person alive in hard times, sure, but they weren’t meant to be used… not unless you’re ready to live with the consequences.” 



A chill settled over me as I realized just how deep this all went.



I hesitated, then told my uncle the truth—I’d already made one of the recipes. I described *Elders’ Emberbread* to him, the earthy sweetness, the warmth it filled me with, leaving out the part about how I’d almost felt compelled to eat it. He let out a harsh sigh and scolded me, his voice sharper than I’d ever heard. “You shouldn’t have touched that bread. None of it. Do you understand me?”



I felt a pang of guilt. “I know… I’m sorry. I promise, I won’t make anything else from the book.”



“Good,” he said, his voice calming a little. “But that’s not enough. You have to get that book away from my sister—your mother—before she does something she can’t take back.”



I tried to assure him I’d do what I could, but he cut me off, his tone deadly serious. “You *need* to do this. Something bad will happen if you don’t.”



Over the next few weeks, as Christmas approached, I stayed in touch with him, paying the collect call fees to keep our conversations going. Every time we talked, the discussion would circle back to the book. I’d tell him about my progress, or lack of it—how I’d tried visiting my mom, only for her to brush me off with excuses, saying she was too busy or that it wasn’t a good time. And each time I talked to her, she seemed to grow colder, more distant, as if that recipe book were slowly casting a shadow over her.



One day, I decided to drop by without any notice at all. When I showed up on her doorstep, she didn’t seem pleased to see me. “You should’ve called first,” she said with a forced smile. “It’s rude, you know, just showing up like this.” Her tone was tight, her words clipped.



I tried to play it off, shrugging and saying I’d just missed her and wanted to check in. But as I scanned the house, I felt a creeping sense of unease. I looked for any sign of the book, hoping I could find it and take it with me, but it was nowhere to be seen. Each time, I’d leave empty-handed, feeling like I was being watched from the shadows as I walked out the door.



Every call with my uncle became more urgent, his insistence that I retrieve the book growing into a kind of desperation. “You have to try harder,” he’d say, his voice strained. “If you don’t get that book away from her, *something’s going to happen*. You have to believe me.”



And deep down, I did believe him. The memory of the Emberbread, the strange warmth, and the subtle pull of that old recipe gnawed at me, as though warning me of something far worse waiting in that book. But it was more than that—something in my mom’s voice, her distant gaze, even her scolding felt *off*. And every time I left her house, I felt a chill settle over me, like I was getting closer to something I wasn’t prepared to see.



Christmas Day finally arrived, and despite my mother’s recent evasions, there was no avoiding me this time. I gathered up the presents I’d bought for them, packed them into my car, and drove to their house, hoping the tension that had grown between us would somehow ease in the warmth of the holiday.



When I knocked, she opened the door and offered a quick, halfhearted hug. The scent of baked ham and sweet glaze wafted out, thick and rich, and for a second, I thought maybe she’d set aside that strange recipe book and returned to her usual cooking. I relaxed a little, hoping the day would be less tense than I’d feared.



“Where’s Dad?” I asked, glancing around for any sign of him.



“Oh, he’s in the garage,” she said, waving it off. “Got a new gadget he’s fussing over, you know him.” She gestured toward the dining room, where plates and holiday decorations were already set up. “Why don’t you sit down? Lunch is almost ready.”



I took off my coat, glancing back at her. She was already turned away, busying herself with the last touches on the table, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of discomfort. Her movements were stiff, almost mechanical, and I could sense the familiar warmth in her was missing. It was like she was there but somehow… *absent*.



Not wanting to disobey my mother on Christmas, I placed my gifts with the others under the tree and took my seat at the dining table. The plate in front of me was polished and waiting, a silver fork and knife perfectly aligned on either side, but the emptiness of it left an unsettling pit in my stomach.



“Should I go get Dad?” I called out, glancing back toward the hallway that led to the garage. He’d usually be the first to greet me, especially on a holiday. The silence from him was off-putting.



“He’ll come when he’s ready,” my mother replied, her voice carrying from the kitchen. “He had a big breakfast, so he can join us later. Let’s go ahead and start.”



Something about her response didn’t sit right. It wasn’t like my dad to skip a Christmas meal, not for any reason. A small, insistent thought tugged at me—maybe it was the book again, casting shadows over everything in my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.



“I’ll just go say hello to him,” I said, rising from the table.



Before I’d even taken a step, she entered the dining room, carrying a large ham on an ornate silver platter. The meat was dark and glossy, almost blackened, the glaze thick and rich, coating every criss-crossed cut she’d made in the skin. The bone jutted out starkly from the center, pale against the charred flesh.



“Sit down,” she said, her voice oddly stern, a hint of irritation slipping through her usual holiday warmth. “This is a special meal. We should enjoy it together.”



I stopped, glancing from her to the closed door of the garage, the words “special meal” repeating in my head, setting off warning bells. Still, I stood my ground, my stomach churning.



“I just want to see Dad, that’s all. I haven’t even said hello.”



Her face tensed, her grip tightening around the platter as her voice rose. “*Sit down* and enjoy lunch with me.” The words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding, like a command I was supposed to follow without question.



But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was lying just beneath the surface of her insistence.



“No,” I snapped, my voice echoing through the dining room. “I’ve had enough of this, Mom! You’ve been obsessed with that damn recipe book, and I’m done with it.” My heart pounded as I looked at her, my words hanging thick in the silence, but I didn’t back down. “I’m going to the garage to get Dad. We’re putting an end to this right now.”



Her face contorted, desperation spilling from her eyes. “Please, just sit down,” she pleaded, her voice cracking as she looked at the untouched plate in front of me. “Let’s have this meal together. It’s… it’s important.”



I took a step toward the garage, determined to get my dad out here, to make him see how far she’d gone. That book had wormed its way too deep into her mind. She shrieked and threw herself in front of the door, arms outstretched as if to block my path. Her face was flushed, her voice frantic.



“*Don’t go in there.* Please, just sit down. Enjoy the meal, savor it,” she begged, her hands trembling as she reached out, practically pleading. There was a desperation in her voice that sounded like fear, not just of me but of what lay beyond that door.



“Mom, you’re acting crazy! We need to talk, and I need to see Dad.” I tried to push past her, but she held her ground, her body a thin, shaky barrier.



“*Please*,” she whispered, voice thin and desperate. “You don’t understand. Don’t disturb him—”



“Dad!” I called out, raising my voice over her pleas. Silence answered at first, followed by a muffled sound—a low, guttural moan, thick and unnatural, rising from the other side of the door. I froze, my blood turning cold as the sound slipped into a horrible, wet gurgle. My mother’s face went white, her eyes wide with terror as she realized I’d heard him.



I felt a surge of adrenaline take over, and before she could react, I shoved her aside and yanked open the door. 



The sight that met me would be seared into my memory forever.



I stepped into the garage and froze, my stomach lurching at the scene before me. My dad lay sprawled across his workbench, his face pale and slick with sweat. His right leg was tied tightly with a belt just above the thigh, a makeshift tourniquet attempting to staunch the flow of blood. A pillowcase was wrapped around the raw, exposed flesh where his leg had been crudely severed, and blood pooled on the concrete floor beneath him, glistening in the cold fluorescent light.



He lifted his head weakly, his eyes glassy and unfocused. His mouth moved, trying to form words, a barely audible rasp escaping as he struggled to speak. “Help… me…”



I didn’t waste a second. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, my fingers shaking so badly it was hard to hit the right buttons. My mother’s shrill screams erupted from behind me as she lunged into the garage, her hands clawing at the air, pleading.



“Stop! *Please!* Just sit down—just have lunch with me!” she wailed, her voice high-pitched and frantic. Her face was twisted in desperation, tears streaming down her cheeks. But I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. I backed up, keeping a wide berth between her and my dad, and relayed the horror I was seeing to the dispatcher.



“It’s my dad… he’s lost his leg. He’s barely conscious,” I stammered, voice cracking. “Please, you need to hurry.”



The dispatcher assured me that help was on the way, asking me to stay on the line, but my mother’s desperate cries filled the garage, creating a haunting echo. She clutched at her head, her fingers digging into her scalp as she repeated, “Please, just come back to the table. Just eat. *You have to eat*!”



I kept my distance, heart pounding, as I watched her spiral into a frantic haze. But she never laid a finger on me; she only circled back to the door, wailing and begging in a chilling frenzy that made my blood run cold.



The police arrived within minutes, their lights flashing against the house, and rushed into the garage to assess the situation. My mother resisted, screaming and flailing as they restrained her, her pleas becoming incoherent sobs as they led her away. I could barely breathe as I watched them take her, her voice a haunting wail that echoed down the driveway, begging me to come back and join her at the table.



Paramedics rushed in and began working on my dad, quickly stabilizing him and loading him onto a stretcher. I followed them outside, numb with shock, barely able to process the scene that had unfolded. In the frigid December air, my mind reeled, looping over her chilling words and the horrible sight in that garage.



That Christmas, the warmth of family and familiarity had turned into something I could barely comprehend, twisted into a nightmare I would never forget.



I stayed by my father’s side every day at the hospital, watching over him as he slowly regained strength. On good days, when the painkillers were working and his mind was clearer, he told me everything he could remember about the last month with my mother. She’d been making strange, elaborate meals every single night since Thanksgiving, insisting he try each one. At first, he thought it was just a new holiday tradition, a way to honor Grandpa’s recipes, but as the dishes grew more unusual, more disturbing, he realized something was deeply wrong. She had started mumbling to herself while she cooked, almost like she was speaking to someone who wasn’t there.



Eventually, he’d stopped eating at the house altogether, sneaking out for meals at nearby diners, finding any excuse he could to avoid her food. He even admitted that on Christmas morning, when he tried to leave, she had drugged his coffee. Everything went hazy after that, and the next thing he remembered was waking up to pain and the horror of what she’d done to his leg.



We discussed the recipe book in hushed tones, both coming to the same terrible conclusion: the book had changed her. My father was hesitant to believe anything so sinister at first, but the memories of her frantic insistence, the look in her eyes, made him certain. Somehow, in some dark, twisted way, the book had drawn her into its thrall.



By New Year’s Eve, he was discharged from the hospital. I promised him I’d stay with him as he recovered, my own guilt over the role I’d unwittingly played gnawing at me. He accepted, his eyes carrying the quiet pain of someone forever altered.



My mother, meanwhile, was undergoing evaluation in a psychiatric hospital. Since that Christmas, I hadn’t seen her. I’d gotten updates from the doctors; they said she was calm, coherent, but that her words remained disturbing. She admitted to doing what she did to my father, repeating over and over, “We need to do what we must to survive the darkest days of the year.” Her voice would drop to a whisper, a distant look in her eyes, as though the phrase were a sacred mantra. 



On New Year’s Eve, as the minutes ticked toward midnight, my father and I went out to his backyard fire pit. I carried the recipe book, feeling its familiar weight in my hands one last time. Without a word, I tossed it into the fire, watching as the flames curled around the old leather, devouring the yellowed pages. It crackled and twisted in the heat, the recipes that had plagued us dissolving into ash. My father’s hand on my shoulder was the only anchor I had as the smoke rose, dissipating into the cold night air.



But as the last ember faded, I felt a pang of something like regret. Later, as I sat alone, staring at my computer, I hovered over the file on my desktop. The digital copy, each recipe scanned and preserved in perfect, chilling detail. I knew I should delete it, erase any trace of the book that had shattered my family. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I fear that it may have a hold on [me.](https://www.reddit.com/user/LCDatkin/)

If you're like me you're probably bored, looking to chat with interesting people and dreading the hard work of finding someone that is mutually interested and trustworthy enough not to ghost you. That requires a few things from me and you: putting in the work and a leap of faith. 

More about my title...

* Introvert - i'm not a hermit by any means but i prefer smaller gatherings and thrive in 1:1s or groups of 4 or less. I'm also a homebody that doesn't drink, doesn't party anymore, and can be often found on friday nights at home watching sports or a movie or binging a show.  

* Dreamer - I spend a lot of time in my head thinking about what ifs, or thinking about the past. It ties into point number one about being an introvert, a lot of things I don't say aloud. Maybe that's why i'm into the whole penpal thing because i can write my thoughts out and put it out there.  Fun random shower thoughts are conspiracy theories, what i'd do if i won the lotto, random side hustles, etc. 

* Nightowl - My circadian rhythm puts me the most awake at night, i can't sleep before midnight and i'm most awake between 10-1am.  I always wanted to try and be a morning person and do the whole 5am wake up and workout thing but that is NOT for me haha. As a result i do prefer sunsets over sunrises, no surprise there. 

* Parent - two young kids has monopolized my life and sucked away any free time for hobbies. If you have kids, maybe you can relate to this.  I have pockets where i can watch something or chat on my phone, but any hobbies that requires leaving the house is a no go until they're a bit older. So bye bye to hiking and camping, golf, playing basketball, random overnight trips w the guys.

Dan put the Aeropress up to the mic to get the sound of him pulling out the plunger and they edit in a balloon popping explosion over it. This happens a **lot** when they say ""oh yeah make that sound again up close for the mic"" or ""haha wow did you hear that sound"" or anything like it; whatever they try to repeat for the mic or whatever you just heard was covered up by layers of sound effects added in post. 

Another thing that keeps happening is they preview the next 'part' of the video in a transition in a way that outright spoils an upcoming bit or joke by literally just showing the whole thing. Some previews at the beginning of the video have done this as well. The bits are a lot less funny when you literally just showed me what was happening, including the punchline.

I don't know how long this has been going on, I don't have the energy to go back through every 10MPH and take notes and see, but it's really irritating to see content that can already be on a pretty bad sliding scale of quality get further cut off at the knees by editing that is actively killing the funny parts. I'm not saying they're not funny at all of course but, as with basically everything GG ever does wrong, if they'd just dial it the fuck back a little bit instead of driving it into the ground it'd be a lot better.",1,1729219265.0,gamegrumps,0,1.0,False

1g67z8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1g67z8z/come_with_me_on_my_journey_to_find_my_signature/,Come with me on my journey to find my signature scent! Part 2 & 3 ,"In case you missed it, I am on the hunt for a signature scent. I have only the vaguest idea of what said signature scent(s) may be like. I knew 0 about perfume before I decided to become really into various smells. 
With that, let us begin in media res: 

second round tries, Hexennacht:

babooshka— slonk 
slow-baked sweet gourds, Russian tea cookies, pipe tobacco, Autumnal spice accord, caramel, nutmeg, honey, coumarin, beeswax absolute, cardamom sugar, crushed apples, black pepper, liatrix absolute.

On first sniff in the bottle this has a pretty strong autumnal spice accord. Candle-y. This might be too pumpkin spice-esque for me. 
Wet and we’re getting pipe tobacco. Like a lot. I’m concerned but waiting it out. The apple is sort of drifting around in there. I’m not getting any roasted gourds :( 
Where did that tobacco just go and what glory she hath left behind her!!!! So well rounded and fall-y, balanced enough that now there’s not one note really taking over, but they’re all still distinct. I never did get gourds, black pepper, or tea cookies though. 
The base notes on this LAST. I swear to God I smelled it in my hair still on wash day.

Is it my signature scent? No, not really. It just doesn't have That Feeling. I'm not Obsessed with it. FS: Meh. Maybe if it’s cheap in the swaps? 

garden party— dram 
petits fours, rooibos tea, lemon curd, rose petals, orange blossom.

I was so excited about the notes on this that I BB a dram during an Ajevie presale. I thought this could be It. Spoiler: I am disappointed. 
The top notes on this are kind of … odd? Right away you get the petit four, but it’s not a sweet vanilla petit four, it’s a lot closer to a buttered, savory biscuit. The rooibos peeks its head up a little right when it’s wet, but barely. I wish it was more forward. There’s a creamy note in this lemon curd that I think is souring with my skin chemistry. I think it’s the initial onslaught of the sharp lemon curd + the butter in the petit fours that’s making this off-putting opening smell. 
Dried down a bit and now we are getting some nice rose petals and orange blossom. The lemon curd smells more normal. I think it’s the butter/petit fours note that’s clashing so much at the beginning, because it’s died down some and I do kind of like this sort of soft floral we’re left with. I don’t think the weird beginning stage is worth it, though. 
Is it my Signature Scent?: No. FS?: No 

sunday mourning—sample 
freshly-juiced blood oranges, stacks of buttermilk pancakes, rivulets of maple syrup, and a melty pat of butter.

In the bottle— the reviews for this I read cautioned about a day-glo, aggressive blood orange top note, but I’m not getting it. I AM getting a lot of maple and what I am assuming is meant to be buttery pancakes. 
While wet— Lots of maple. It’s a very realistic sweet maple syrup smell. Pancakes are not here for me. 
Dried down, this is a yummy maple scent. The orange is being very coy with me and kind of peeking her head up here and there. I think it would be cute and fun for a brunch date. It’s not really something I’d go for outside of that. 
Is it my Signature Scent?: No. FS?: No 

belsnickel—sample 
strong coffee, streusel coffee cake, nutmeg, brown sugar, toasted almonds.

Very bitter coffee note. It’s definitely giving baked good. I don’t think I like toasted almond that much. I smell this one as soon as I open my little samples box, it is pretty strong. On a second wear I started to get a lot more streusel, but I don’t know that I like it for me.
Is it my Signature Scent?: No. FS?: No 

third round tries: 

hestia— sample 
marshmallow and clove. This is quite heavy on the marshmallow, with juuuuust enough clove to give it a spicy 'kick'. (also very similar to Cloven, but with marshmallow in lieu of spun sugar)

This is a slutty little perfume. I mean this in the most delightful, complimentary way possible. I think if I met a girl on the street and she was wearing this I would fall in love with her instantly. She probably majored in poetry and wears a lot of black and goes to dive bars and smokes American Spirits. She’s cool, she’s fun, she’s daring, she’s sexy. I’m looking for something that’s giving a little more lace & ribbons for every day, though. **Update: did get a lot more marshmallow after 2 weeks resting. I’m kind of obsessed with this marshmallow note. **Update again: this would actually be the beginning of some kind of Thing for me 

Is it my Signature Scent?: No FS?: Maybe? 

Loup Garou— sample 
silver amber, fur, lunar musk 

This one haunted me for a while until I got the sample. I just kept seeing rave reviews and thinking about it. I wouldn’t usually go for an amber note (I had a bad experience with BBW Amber notes) but I was so intrigued. 
In the bottle you get a lot more fur. This was my first encounter with a realistic fur note and I was startled. It mostly went away for me once on. 
This is a very nice perfume. Like when a fancy lady walks past, she leaves this behind her, but not at all in an old lady or department store way. That musk is sooo clean and expensive.
Husband said: “Mid.” We’ll see if I wear it. 
Dear reader, I did not wear it. It went soapy. Really soapy. RIP. 
Is it my Signature Scent?: No. FS?: No 

Le Chat Noir— sample 
Chimney smoke, freshly fallen snow, and the cool, dry, musky scent of a cat just in from a long winter stroll.

This was barely smoky on me. It’s slightly different than Loup Garou, maybe a little more masculine feeling. I don’t know the science behind the snow note but it’s very on the nose. I might have my husband wear it in the winter. Update: I destashed it and I kind of wish I hadn't because I do want the experience of smelling a snow note like this again. It was so photorealistic it made me literally long for winter (?? the worst season, IMO?? Perfume is weird.) 

Is it my Signature Scent?: No FS?: No 

Lavender Shortbread—sample 
delectably buttery shortbread cookies + Bulgarian essential oil.

In the bottle it is buttery shortbread biscuits. Like the little scottie dogs. Straight up, there’s no mistaking it. I’m not really getting any lavender, to be honest. My husband— despite saying he is not a gourmand fan— kept huffing my arm, so he definitely likes it. 
Later—
Okay, I confess. I slathered. It’s soooo buttery but just sweet enough and I definitely am getting the lavender now. I can’t believe how realistic it is. I am starting to understand the hype around Hex’s gourmands. 

Is it my Signature Scent?: Undetermined, in the runners up. FS?: No, actually… this kind of fell by the wayside for me once I got rounds 4 & 5 and I only used maybe 1/3 of the sample. 

Lavender London Fog— sample 
earl grey tea, steamed milk, vanilla, lavender simple syrup.
This girlie was sooo photorealistic for me once she was on. Straight out of the bottle and it’s a lot of bergamot. On wet, that bergamot top note is nice and hangs out for a while, actually. Once the milk really comes in it’s like sticking your nose in your teacup. Even the lavender note— which is kind of coming and going for me— is very much lavender simple syrup and not any other kind of lavender. Lovely and definitely a cozy scent. I really like how it smells on my laundry when I come across it. 

Is it my Signature Scent?: No. FS?: I went through this sample so fast, I ordered a dram. Oops. I'm not supposed to be ordering too many non-sample sizes, we must reserve our funds for The One... 

tldr; I ordered some more Hex samples and discovered that maybe I actually don't like florals or musks as much as I thought, and maybe I do need to smell like a marshmallow, but a slightly complicated marshmallow, with no almonds... We are on the right track. There's also a round of just Sorce and a round of just Nui Cobalt coming up!!  ",3,1729218771.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

10 hours earlier 

The sound of the bus engine almost can drown out my thoughts. it’s quite soothing. I take a sip of my plain old boring black coffee and look out to see the sun rising. I used to melt at the sight of a sun-rise. That was 25 years ago. “greenway street” the bus driver calls as the bus stops. 
I grab my work bag and stand up, walk off the bus and scanning my wrist on the credit reader.

6:45am 
I walk onto the 22nd floor and head to my cubicle, scanning my wrist to clock in for work. 
I sit down, take a sip of coffee and start my 8 hour shift

12:15pm

After finishing up a paper the computer shuts off for the mandated 20 minute lunch. The food bots  come into the floor and go into every cubicle. The company doesn’t have time to waste so they started making food that gets delivered to you. Today it looks like dry white  and some genetically altered turkey for protein along with room temperature  water. The food bot extends its arms and places the meal in front of my computer. its arms retract and the bot goes Into rest mode as a 20 minute timer appears on the screen where eyes would be if it was a human. 

12:35pm.   4 hours before I die
i’ve had better here at work but that meal sure filled me up. The bots arms extend, taking the tray and leaves from the room. My computer turns back on and I get back to work.

3:00 pm 1 hour untill I die
Finishing up my last paper for the day my computer shuts off at 3pm on the dot. I get up and grab my bag and head out of the cubicle. I take the elevator down. I head out to the bus.

3:15pm
I ride the bus home. it’s like any other day but today i’ve got this weird feeling in my stomach. it’s probably  that turkey. 

3:45pm 15 minutes untill I die
I step off the bus after paying and start walking home which is a few blocks over. Should take me about 20 minutes.

4:00pm

10 hours earlier 

The sound of the bus engine almost can drown out my thoughts. it’s quite soothing. I take a sip of my plain old boring black coffee and look out to see the sun rising. I used to melt at the sight of a sun-rise. That was 25 years ago. “greenway street” the bus driver calls as the bus stops. 
I grab my work bag and stand up, walk off the bus and scanning my wrist on the credit reader.

6:45am 
I walk onto the 22nd floor and head to my cubicle, scanning my wrist to clock in for work. 
I sit down, take a sip of coffee and start my 8 hour shift

12:15pm

After finishing up a paper the computer shuts off for the mandated 20 minute lunch. The food bots  come into the floor and go into every cubicle. The company doesn’t have time to waste so they started making food that gets delivered to you. Today it looks like dry white  and some genetically altered turkey for protein along with room temperature  water. The food bot extends its arms and places the meal in front of my computer. its arms retract and the bot goes Into rest mode as a 20 minute timer appears on the screen where eyes would be if it was a human. 

12:35pm.   4 hours before I die
i’ve had better here at work but that meal sure filled me up. The bots arms extend, taking the tray and leaves from the room. My computer turns back on and I get back to work.

3:00 pm 1 hour untill I die
Finishing up my last paper for the day my computer shuts off at 3pm on the dot. I get up and grab my bag and head out of the cubicle. I take the elevator down. I head out to the bus.

3:15pm
I ride the bus home. it’s like any other day but today i’ve got this weird feeling in my stomach. it’s probably  that turkey. 

3:45pm 15 minutes untill I die
I step off the bus after paying and start walking home which is a few blocks over. Should take me about 20 minutes.

It was a few days before Christmas and we both hung out for coffee and talked about our plans for the holidays. 

She told me that she really did appreciate our friendship and how much she wished the world was a better place. I didn't pay attention to the clues, thinking it was her normal attitude of being bothered about everything. 
I wish I could remember about other things we talked about, but that’s just the way it goes, right? You never know when the last time you see someone is, so you don’t make the effort to remember much.

The day she died, there was just this heavy sadness over her friends and family and everyone who knew her. It felt like she turned the lights off when she left. 

It taught me a lesson: that even the happiest looking person could be silently going through their darkest moment while putting on a smile. 

Every since, I visit her grave every year on December 22nd. I bring her beautiful flowers, and just hang out and talk to her about life. 

If you're reading this, I just wanna say I miss you so so much. The world is still a cold, dark and lonely place. Nothing has changed.

I thought about DMing her on instagram to see how she's doing (don't have her number), maybe ask to hang out.

However, I think she has a BF. I'm not looking to have a relationship with her, just seriously want to hang out as friends, get coffee or something. He can even come if he wants, I'd be fine meeting him and could understand if he would be concerned.

Is this something that I should avoid doing? I don't want to push any boundaries with their relationship, it's really not my intention.

This just really sucks, and honestly just typing this out can make me feel better sometimes, even if no one responds.

2 nights ago, I made a post about having a bad cramp in my stomach right before I was going to go to sleep for the night.

I wound up sitting up, sipping tea, trying to calm down until 4am when I was finally able to go to sleep.

I woke up yesterday feeling even worse than I did the night before. My stomach/waist kept cramping up, and I felt like there was something laying in my stomach really badly.

I kept myself busy by doing laundry all day, and just cleaning the house to try and keep myself moving, and not thinking about feeling bad.

I felt hungry too, but the heavy feeling in my stomach was so intense yesterday, I felt too N* to eat. Plus eating with cramps usually just brings on more cramps for me.

My mom was also complaining of the same thing, minus the N*, but she actually had me make her dinner last night, ate it, and felt fine with no issues after that.

She drinks a ton of coffee all day on an empty stomach, so I think that was her issue, because she's totally fine today.

I finally felt a break last night around 10:30pm, and instantly took the opportunity to sleep.

I then woke up at 2:30am feeling so dizzy and shaky from not eating. So I got up, and ate a few gummy peach rings just to get some sugar in me to stop feeling so weak.

That helped until 7:30am, when I had to finally just try and actually eat something, even though I still felt pretty S*.

As I was eating, I could feel the stomach cramps start again. I finished my food, which was just some more light noodle soup, and toast, and thankfully didn't feel woozy anymore, but was having the cramps.

These cramps are all in my lower stomach/waist area.

I took a nap after that, and when I woke up, I didn't feel too bad actually. My dad asked him to make him something for dinner, so I went out and got started on that.

Halfway through that, the cramps came back, just as bad as yesterday again. I had to go to the bathroom like 3 times within an hour. No D*, but it felt like I was going to have some at some point. I still might.

It's also been like 14 hours since I last ate again now though, and I'm feeling kind of woozy again, but the cramps are too bad for me to want to eat. I know if I eat, the cramps will get worse.

The cramps and wooziness is making me N* though, and I'm panicking.

Once again, everyone is in bed, so I can't talk to anyone, or run around cleaning things without bothering someone, so I just kind of have to deal with it, and that makes me feel trapped.

I feel like it's hard to breathe, I'm shaky, kind of dizzy, a little N*, my stomach/waist hurts, and I keep having to go to the bathroom.

TMI, but the last time I went, it came out with such force, if it was D*, it would have been explosive.

I genuinely can't think of what could be causing this.

Usually I can point to a certain food I ate that would flare up my IBS, or something like that. For the last week and a half though, I really haven't been eating much, so I'm nervous I have an SV*.

I know realistically, if I were to V*, it probably would have happened by now, seeing as this is the 3rd day of this, but I still feel so awful, it's making me panic.

As they go through tasting each of the coffees both Rhett and Link make it clear that they don't care for the coffees that have caramel in them. They're the ones tasting these, that is their opinion. Simple as that. 

Stevie later comments about her distaste for them not liking the caramel. You think it's a bit of a joke when later, she thanks Rhett for apologizing about it.

I've been at this losing weight thing for a few months over 2 years now and while there have been frustrations I've found just keeping to it has worked out soon enough.

Until now! I've been stuck losing and gaining the same 2-3 pounds (probably of water weight) for three months now.

I track every single thing that gets eaten/drank and I typically eat mostly the same variety of foods during my work week (sometimes lunch is banh mi, sometimes it's a rice and bean and chicken bowl, sometimes it's a caprese sandwich and eggs) but what I generally do is have a coffee and small bite for breakfast (150-300 cals total), eat the bulk of my calories at lunch (700-900), and then I'm not really hungry later on for a full meal at dinner so I eat the rest of my deficit in fresh fruit, grilled fish, a protein shake, really whatever sounds good and fits in the rest of what I need to eat. I try to get in between 80-100g of protein per day and eat between 1350 and 1600 calories. I also walk 7500-10000 steps at least 5 days every week, because I walk to and from work and to and from my lunch break, which is a change I made a little over a year ago.

The last time I had significant progress in my weight loss was at the end of July when I had the flu and lost 3lbs over a week. Since then? Nothing. It's really frustrating, I haven't changed anything that was working for me but all of a sudden it just comes to a halt!

1g67gtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g67gtj/hr_sage_and_the_unseen/,[HR] Sage and the unseen,"Sage had always been captivated by the unknown. It started with bedtime stories—the kind that whispered of things lurking in the dark to send you to sleep with shivers. Soon, ghost tales and demon lore consumed her curiosity, evolving into a full-blown obsession. Now, her shelves overflowed with books on demonology, the occult, and all things paranormal. Her life was a constant search for the supernatural, the unseen world that she *knew* existed—but could never quite touch. The problem was, no matter how much she studied, researched, or delved into the dark corners of ancient texts, the supernatural never revealed itself to her. It was like chasing the wind—she could feel the thrill, the pull, but nothing ever materialized.

 

Her obsession with the unreal became a strange comfort, a puzzle she couldn't solve. But her day job at **The Black Cat Coffee House** was the anchor to her otherwise ungraspable world.  She shared her shifts with Emilio, whom she called Milo, a soft-spoken guy with dark, curly hair and a knack for making the best cappuccinos in town.  Sage liked him well enough; they joked about customers and bonded over late-night shifts. He was normal, a little too normal for her taste or so she thought. Whenever she mentioned ghosts, ghouls, or anything supernatural, Milo would hesitate or quickly change the subject. It was odd, almost as if he was deliberately avoiding the topic.

 

There was something about him, though—something she couldn't put her finger on. Sometimes, she'd catch him staring off at nothing or looking uncomfortable when they passed by certain places at the shop, but he would never mention anything afterwards as if trying to pretend nothing was there.

Sage’s curiosity had always been insatiable, and once an idea took root, there was no shaking it. Milo’s strange reactions during their shifts at the coffee shop became her new obsession. She started paying closer attention to the subtle details she had previously overlooked. Whenever customers joked about haunted houses or shared ghost stories, she’d notice how Milo would tense up, his grip on the espresso machine tightening as he fought to maintain his composure. His usual easygoing demeanor would vanish, replaced by an unsettling tension that hung in the air.

It wasn’t just the conversations, either. Sage had started observing how he interacted with their workspace. He would occasionally glance at the dimly lit corners of the café, his eyes lingering for just a moment longer than necessary, as if he were waiting for something to emerge from the shadows. To anyone else, it might have seemed like a passing glance, but to Sage, it felt as though he could see something she couldn’t. The atmosphere around them always seemed to shift in those moments—thickening with an invisible weight that made her skin prickle.

Even more curious was the way Milo would immediately shut down whenever she tried to broach the topic. His smile would falter, and he’d skillfully redirect the conversation, as if the mere mention of the supernatural was something he couldn’t bear to acknowledge. Sage couldn’t help but wonder what he was hiding and why he was so determined to keep her from discovering the truth.

Then on one rainy Thursday, during a late-night shift, it finally came to a head.

They were cleaning up after a quiet evening, wiping down tables as the storm rumbled outside, the sound of thunder echoing through the glass windows. The lights in the café flickered intermittently, casting long shadows that seemed to stretch unnaturally across the walls, making the cozy space feel more cavernous and mysterious. Sage paused mid-wipe, glancing around, her senses heightened. The air felt heavy once again, thick with an energy that crackled like static, reminiscent of other nights when she had thought she was on the verge of sensing something supernatural. She bit her lip, her heart racing with a mix of excitement and trepidation, wondering if tonight would finally reveal the secrets lurking just beyond her reach. ""Milo,"" she said, trying to keep her voice casual, ""do you ever feel like… like there’s something in here?""

Milo paused; his cloth frozen in midair. His face was unreadable, but there was a tension in his shoulders she hadn't noticed before.

""Like what?"" he asked, without looking up.

""I don’t know… just… like there’s a presence,"" she said, watching him closely.

Milo was quiet for a moment, then shrugged. ""You read too many horror novels, Sage.""

It was a deflection—she knew it. And now she *knew* she was onto something. Milo had always been careful, brushing off her questions, but this was different. This was something he didn’t want to talk about, and that only made her more determined to figure it out.

For days after that, she watched him closely. Every time the air felt odd, or a shadow seemed out of place, she'd sneak glances at him. And every time, Milo would either stiffen or avoid looking in the same direction.

Finally, she couldn’t take it anymore. The curiosity burned in her chest.

Another late shift found them alone in the café, the night settling in quietly around them. Sage leaned against the counter, arms crossed, watching Milo as he closed the register.

""Milo,"" she started, her tone deliberately casual, ""you ever think about ghosts?""

He froze for just a second before continuing what he was doing. ""Not really.""

""Liar,"" she said, smiling. ""Come on, I’ve seen the way you act sometimes. You’re hiding something.""

Milo didn’t look up, his fingers flying over the register keys. ""You’re imagining things, Sage.""

""No, I’m not."" She stepped closer, lowering her voice. ""I *know* you can see them.""

That finally got him. He stopped, his body tensing. Slowly, he turned to face her, his eyes unreadable, but there was a hardness in his expression she’d never seen before. ""Sage,"" he said quietly, ""drop it.""

Sage blinked, taken aback by the sudden seriousness in his tone. ""Why? Why won’t you just tell me?""

Milo’s jaw tightened. ""Because it’s not something I want to talk about. Ever.""

""But why?"" She stepped even closer, her voice softening. ""You know how much I’m into this stuff. I’ve been chasing the supernatural my whole life. And here you are, living with it.""

He shook his head, his eyes darkening. ""That’s exactly why I don’t want to tell you. You think it’s all fun and games. You want to see it, but you don’t understand. It’s not what you think.""

Sage opened her mouth to argue, but Milo cut her off.

“Do you know why I never talk about it? Why I avoid it?” Milo’s voice was sharp, his eyes wide and filled with a frantic intensity that sent a chill down Sage’s spine. He spoke quickly, his words tumbling out in a rush, each one laced with an urgency that was impossible to ignore. “Because people like you, people who are obsessed with the occult and ghosts, think it’s some sort of adventure, something cool and mysterious to chase. But it’s not. It’s dark- It’s ugly- And once you see it, you can’t unsee it. Trust me,” he said, his voice dropping to a near whisper, trembling with fear, “you don’t want to be a part of that world. It’ll consume you.”

Sage stared at him, speechless for a moment. She’d never seen him so serious, so guarded.

""But… you’ve been living with this your whole life,"" she said, trying to process what he was saying. ""How do you—""

""I don’t live with it,"" he interrupted, his voice quieter now, but no less intense. ""I survive it.""

The weight of his words hit her hard, and for the first time, she realized how much she had been romanticizing something that was clearly much darker for him.

She shifted awkwardly. ""I didn’t know it was like that…""

Milo sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. ""I didn’t want you to know. I don’t tell anyone. Not even people who are into the occult like you. Because you don’t get to pick and choose the parts you want to see. It’s all or nothing.""

Sage swallowed hard, unsure of what to say. She felt like she had just opened Pandora’s box, and she wasn’t sure she was ready for what came next.

Milo glanced at her, then sighed. ""Look, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to freak you out. But seriously, let it go, okay?""

Sage nodded, though her mind was still spinning. Part of her wanted to respect his boundaries, to acknowledge the fear and seriousness in his voice, but the other part—the curious, obsessive part—couldn’t help but claw at her insides, desperate to push past that fear now that she knew the truth. Days passed, and she was tormented by the sense that she was missing out on something monumental, something just beyond her reach. Each time they worked together, she tried to respect Milo’s space, yet her curiosity gnawed at her relentlessly, filling her with a restless energy that was hard to ignore. And then, one night, when the café felt unusually still and the shadows loomed larger than ever, she found her opportunity—one that sent a thrill of both excitement and dread coursing through her veins.

They finished their shift, locking up the café as usual. Milo said a quick goodbye and started walking home, but Sage hesitated. She knew it was wrong, but something urged her to follow him.

She kept at a distance; her footsteps quiet as she trailed behind him through the dark, damp streets. She wasn’t entirely sure what she was expecting to see, but her heart raced with anticipation. Maybe she’d catch him talking to a ghost. Maybe she’d see something she wasn’t supposed to.

But nothing happened—at first. They reached his street, and Sage was just about to turn back when Milo suddenly stopped. He turned slowly, his eyes locking onto a figure at the end of the street.

Sage followed his gaze, but all she saw were shadows dancing in the distance, shifting and flickering in the dim light, nothing more than an illusion created by the cold night air. She heard a voice cut through the silence, trembling with fear. “No… please leave me alone today.” It was Milo, and the vulnerability in his tone sent a shiver down her spine.  
Sage’s pulse quickened, her heart racing as dread crept into her chest. “What do you see?” she asked under her breath as to say unheard and unseen.    
Milo’s face turned pale, his eyes wide with fear. “Why are you here?” She heard Milo’s voice clearly, but the response that followed was distorted, as if she were listening to an untuned radio crackling in a thunderstorm—jagged and indecipherable, filled with static that drowned out any coherent words but the fact she heard anything at all made her freeze in place.  
Her heart raced, a mix of terror and exhilaration coursing through her veins. This was it—her first real encounter with the supernatural. But as the air around them grew colder and heavier, she sensed a presence closing in, its intent to harm unmistakable. Although she couldn’t see the dark figure haunting Milo, she felt its malevolent energy, a cursed force that had stalked him for far too long.

 

Sage’s instinct to protect him surged within her, overriding her fear. She might not have visual confirmation of the creature lurking just beyond her perception, but the threat was palpable, like a weight pressing down on her chest. Summoning every ounce of courage, she stepped out of the shadows and called out, “Milo!” Her voice rang out, firm yet steady.

 

As if responding to her call, the oppressive energy around Milo seemed to waver, momentarily disrupted by her presence. “RUN TOWARDS ME! Don’t look back!” she shouted, her heart pounding with urgency.

 

Milo glanced over his shoulder, confusion etched across his features, but he obeyed, quickening his pace. With each step he took, Sage felt a rush of warmth surge through her, an unexpected power igniting within her that she had never known existed. In that moment, she realized she wasn’t just a passive observer; she could influence the darkness, even if only for a brief second.

 

With every hurried step, the unseen specter grew more agitated, swirling around Milo like a tempest. The air crackled with tension, and Sage focused intently, pushing against the heavy presence that threatened to consume him. For the first time, she felt the stirrings of the supernatural enveloping her, a strange connection that thrilled and terrified her in equal measure.

 

As they rounded a corner, a chilling wail echoed through the night, giving her goosebumps. But Sage refused to back down. She knew now that she was part of this world, whether she had sought it out or not. Clinging to the hope that she could help Milo confront whatever haunted him, she pushed forward, ready to face the darkness that lurked just out of sight.",1,1729217103.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Soon, you built a small library, releasing new tracks each month. The subscribers kept growing. It was thrilling to realize that even as you slept, your audience was out there drifting into dreams, thanks to the soundscapes you created. And the best part? It runs itself now—new sounds are scheduled, payments are automated, and your playlist empire hums quietly in the background.

*""But you are a far-right/leftist if you don't vote for my party!""*

No I am not, I don't care about any of them. You should visit a therapist if you think that me not supporting A means I support B.

*""Have you read Project 2025/Kamala's policies?""*

Nope. And I do not plan on reading them.

*""But why?""*

Because it is within my rights not to vote or not to care. It is none of your damn business as to my reasons for not participating in the election process. This is my ballot, and my rights, not yours. I don't owe you, or anyone else an explanation as to why I am not voting. I have my own personal reasons, NONE of which are your business. So quit asking me, and quit pestering me, because I will never register to vote.

*""You're ignorant!""*

That's your opinion, and I respect it. However, last time I checked, being ignorant wasn't a crime. It's within my damn rights to be ignorant. 

*""You will regret this! Don't complain later when x candidate wins!""*

I am from a country where food was delivered in military trucks. Nothing in the USA can ever hurt me more than what my home country did to me. Stop assuming I am concerned with your problems, no I am not.

*""Easy for you to say! None of project 2025/Kamala's plans affect you!""*

Lol, I can smell the Oregon white mid-40s upper middle class neo-liberal in a starbucks coffee all the way here in Los Angeles from this comment. Or the Texan white mid-60s elite class conservative in a pickup truck waiting in line for McDonalds. But seriously that's such a stupid and privileged assumption to make. Go stalk my profile like normal angry redditors do and tell me how ""privileged"" I am.😂😂

But fine lets play devils advocate and say that I am privileged in every way possible, from my citizenship, to race, to income. Yes, it is easy for them to say. However, they do NOT owe you an explanation or a response as to why they are not voting, and you do NOT have the right to continue to pester them repeatedly about it.

So, leave me TF alone, go get a job or something, and mind your own business. Abstinence from voting isn't a crime, however repeatedly pestering someone to vote when I asked them to STFU is harassment. Take your political garbage to a rally or protest or something.

1g67fry,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1g67fry/sage_and_the_unseen/,Sage and the unseen,"Sage had always been captivated by the unknown. It started with bedtime stories—the kind that whispered of things lurking in the dark to send you to sleep with shivers. Soon, ghost tales and demon lore consumed her curiosity, evolving into a full-blown obsession. Now, her shelves overflowed with books on demonology, the occult, and all things paranormal. Her life was a constant search for the supernatural, the unseen world that she *knew* existed—but could never quite touch. The problem was, no matter how much she studied, researched, or delved into the dark corners of ancient texts, the supernatural never revealed itself to her. It was like chasing the wind—she could feel the thrill, the pull, but nothing ever materialized.

 

Her obsession with the unreal became a strange comfort, a puzzle she couldn't solve. But her day job at **The Black Cat Coffee House** was the anchor to her otherwise ungraspable world.  She shared her shifts with Emilio, whom she called Milo, a soft-spoken guy with dark, curly hair and a knack for making the best cappuccinos in town.  Sage liked him well enough; they joked about customers and bonded over late-night shifts. He was normal, a little too normal for her taste or so she thought. Whenever she mentioned ghosts, ghouls, or anything supernatural, Milo would hesitate or quickly change the subject. It was odd, almost as if he was deliberately avoiding the topic.

 

There was something about him, though—something she couldn't put her finger on. Sometimes, she'd catch him staring off at nothing or looking uncomfortable when they passed by certain places at the shop, but he would never mention anything afterwards as if trying to pretend nothing was there.

Sage’s curiosity had always been insatiable, and once an idea took root, there was no shaking it. Milo’s strange reactions during their shifts at the coffee shop became her new obsession. She started paying closer attention to the subtle details she had previously overlooked. Whenever customers joked about haunted houses or shared ghost stories, she’d notice how Milo would tense up, his grip on the espresso machine tightening as he fought to maintain his composure. His usual easygoing demeanor would vanish, replaced by an unsettling tension that hung in the air.

It wasn’t just the conversations, either. Sage had started observing how he interacted with their workspace. He would occasionally glance at the dimly lit corners of the café, his eyes lingering for just a moment longer than necessary, as if he were waiting for something to emerge from the shadows. To anyone else, it might have seemed like a passing glance, but to Sage, it felt as though he could see something she couldn’t. The atmosphere around them always seemed to shift in those moments—thickening with an invisible weight that made her skin prickle.

Even more curious was the way Milo would immediately shut down whenever she tried to broach the topic. His smile would falter, and he’d skillfully redirect the conversation, as if the mere mention of the supernatural was something he couldn’t bear to acknowledge.

Let's talk about something that can really change your life - building a positive mindset through daily habits. It's not about being unrealistically cheerful all the time, but rather about cultivating a healthier, more resilient outlook on life.

First things first, why not start your day with a little gratitude? It doesn't have to be anything big - just take a moment to appreciate the warm cup of coffee in your hands or the comfy bed you just got out of. Trust me, it sets a great tone for the day ahead.

Now, I know life can get hectic, but hear me out - try squeezing in some mindfulness or meditation. It doesn't have to be an hour-long session; even five minutes of deep breathing or focusing on the present moment can work wonders for your mental state.

Speaking of mental state, let's talk about that voice in your head. You know, the one that sometimes likes to put you down? Well, it's time to turn that around. Catch yourself when you're being overly critical and try to rephrase those thoughts more positively. It might feel a bit weird at first, but with practice, it becomes second nature.

Setting goals is great, but make sure they're achievable. There's nothing more discouraging than constantly falling short. Break big goals into smaller, manageable steps. Each time you tick one off, you'll get a little boost of motivation.

Now, I can't stress this enough - get moving! Exercise isn't just good for your body; it's a mood-booster too. Find something you enjoy, whether it's dancing, hiking, or just a brisk walk around the block. Your mind will thank you for it.

Take a look around you. Are you surrounded by people and things that lift you up or bring you down? Try to spend more time with positive influences and limit exposure to negativity. This includes social media - don't be afraid to unfollow accounts that don't make you feel good.

Here's a simple yet powerful habit: do something kind for someone else every day. It doesn't have to be grand - holding the door open, sending a supportive text, or even just smiling at a stranger can make both their day and yours a little brighter.

Life isn't always smooth sailing, and that's okay. Instead of getting frustrated by challenges, try to see them as opportunities to learn and grow. It's all about perspective.

Don't forget to celebrate your wins, no matter how small they might seem. Finished a tough work project? Treat yourself to your favorite snack. Finally got around to organizing that messy drawer? Do a little victory dance. Acknowledging your progress, however minor, can be incredibly motivating.

Lastly, remember to take care of yourself. Get enough sleep, eat well, and make time for activities you enjoy. A well-rested, well-nourished you is much better equipped to handle whatever life throws your way.

Building these habits takes time and effort, but stick with it. Before you know it, you'll find yourself approaching life with a more positive, resilient mindset. And that, my friend, can make all the difference in the world.

We met at a library where we both spend all our days studying and became quite close over the last 3 months. We started travelling and having most meals together and we always have a gala time hanging out. We share the same sense of humour so the breaks that we take together help us destress from the stresses of our work. She’s appearing for a competitive exam and I am enrolled in a very costly design program that demands minimum 10 hours of work everyday. I take on the role of the elder sister in the relationship and let her be a little carefree as I found that to be harmless initially. 

However I started noticing patterns of selfishness and how the friendship was slowly turning to be one sided. I would help her organise her daily time tables for study and help her calm down whenever she got overwhelmed and encouraged her to study more. She was also incredibly nice to me most of the time, bringing ice cream for me during pms and driving me home. 

But her emotional immaturity is slowly getting on my nerves. She has anger issues (got into a road rage), is into a ldr but questions her attraction towards her boyfriend every time she starts talking to a new guy, becomes extra bubbly and enthusiastic towards guys, and frequently cuts my sentences in both personal conversations and conversations with other people. She spent 5 days making a bday gift for her boyfriend and subsequently went on a movie with another guy friend spending half a day there. 

There’s a dance festival that happens only once a year here in India and when I urged her to come with me for one day for a mere 3 hours she told me that she has to study. The very next day she asked me to come out with her as she was craving fries and coffee (we usually end up spending 2 hours if we go out). The garba dance night meant a lot to me and this imbecile has the audacity to ask me to go out with her when she cancelled my plan. She ended up coming late for two more days and since I know her schedule so well, I know she wasn’t studying. 

She and I also got into an argument about religion (she’s quite radical with her views) and she walked out on me after instigating the disagreement. (She was defending a misogynistic god who’s quite celebrated by the right wing and felt offended when I called out the sexist undertones) Even though the friendship started on even terms it’s becoming more skewed over time, where she uses me for emotional support but doesn’t give it back. She comes to me for relationship problems but when I share my feelings about my traumatic past, she has nothing to say. 

I stopped talking to her after that incident and she hasn’t tried talking to me since. I feel like this is a good time to stop this behaviour and set a precedent for this friendship if it goes further, that I cannot tolerate such a skewed relationship. The rational part of me doesn’t stress over letting this go but there’s an anxious part of me that still wants the friendship without the fluff. I feel like I’m ruminating over this.

For years ad infinitum I have had and to this day use a collective of imported manual brewing configurations by ILSA, Alessi, Giannini, et cetera. Never have I had and/or used an espresso machine for never I had sufficient funds to have one. I have got and use a recently repaired Baratza Forté AP whose display I modified with textural tactile round adhesive things. I have always been totally bereft of eyesight and thus operate by touch and sound.

Next month for three days I was asked to be the barista to prepare and serve espresso all day and possible cappuccino before 11:11. Of course I obliged. He knows I lack experience but knows I will learn and do all things to perfection. I recommended some of the highest quality and most enjoyable single origin recently roasted coffee I have ever tasted. Unfortunately it will not be fresh by next month for it had to be purchased before it sold out which I am sure will affect the output of each cup. I shall take my grinder for I know it can handle two hundred approximate cups each day. I selected the Breville Dual Boiler espresso machine for him to purchase although my hands were never laid upon it but it seems to be a decent compromise amongst commercial machines which I would _love_ to have and anything lower-end consumer-grade and I cannot live like that. This is the lowest quality machine I can allow myself to use and hopefully I made a wise decision. I plan to take some coffee from my personal stash also sealed in either vacuum-resealable canisters and/or air-tight displacement canisters. Not fresh but recently roasted. Finally I asked him to purchase distilled water for that is the most clean and pure option that comes to mind. I use extremely filtrated water for coffee, tea, cooking, et cetera but not distilled. This month he and I shall do test runs with different variables, viz. coffee beans and grind size [I shall start at maximum of 2Q], to attempt to minimise uncertainty and allow me to familiarise with the machine after he programmes it.

Mind you; I’m an electronic producer. And one day, my dreams literally came true. I mean, literally.
The night before I dreamt I met skrillex, and he invited me to the studio. I woke up and went about my day, told my partner all about it when we got to the studio. It was a slow day so we were playing 2k in the lounge. 10 minutes after telling my buddy the dream I had, there was a knock on the door.

And it was Sonny.
Both our eyes lit up, and we couldn’t hold our mouths. My buddy yelled “WHAT THE FUCK”
And I just completely froze.

I’m not sure how I could have dreamt about meeting him the night before. It still blows my mind. 

But anyway, he wasn’t there for us. He was there to work with a major artist in the label, he winks at us and continues towards the room they’re in.

My buddy and I decide not to go into a room, instead we stay in the lounge area since we know he’s bound to have to pass by again. And when he does, I had my laptop ready to go with a tune.

I asked for a minute of his time, let me tell you, for a musical giant… this dude is the most humble person I ever met. He says “hell yeah play it” and he kneels down to listen as my computer was on a coffee table. After a minute or so of jamming, he says “you mind if I?…” and points at the computer…
My heart dropped. 
I said “BRO, ofcourse. YOU CAN KEEP MY COMPUTER if you wanted to haha” (jokingly)

And goes on to work on the song I had started on ableton for about an hour! Explaining what he’s doing in the process and where I should take it next. I couldn’t believe it was happening. But oh it was. He spent almost an hour with me working on the song, not to mention he was there for a big artist for a big album but he used his time to sit there with me.

Still an unbelievable full circle moment for me, because the reason I downloaded ableton 12 years ago was simply because, that’s what skrillex used.

One thing that I have been struggling with, is still the need to control and almost test me to still prove love and care towards him? 

When he broke up with me he asked to “keep me close and who knows for the near future”. He then displayed really erratic behaviours where one moment he would be very respectful and the next send me inappropriate tik tok videos. Whenever I would call him out he would say he just found it funny. After I decided to go no contact and that we couldn’t be friends, he has reached out and asked me very specific questions about my life to which I answer very minimally. He also will tell me about his dating life. I had planned to meet up with him for coffee because he had said very concerning things and he went off on me when I didn’t wait around for him. He simply told me “point proven”.

I remember when he broke up with me he asked for unconditional love so I am wondering if this is perhaps his way of making me prove it to him? I fully understand the fear of rejection/abandonment and then the flip of engulfment and the various protection strategies. To which he displayed many. I am just trying to understand this need for control in terms of dynamic of a ex dynamic. 

Thank you!

Hi guys! I’m a 20 year old female with diagnosed high functioning autism. My main problems I face are sensory, especially food and food anxieties/ocd. I’ve been like this since I was very young, labeled a picky eater, when in reality, I just had severe food aversions. It’s embarrassing to admit but I have a TERRIBLE diet. I know I’m young but I should be eating better. I mostly eat the same things every day in a routine: a croissant and coffee for breakfast, I usually skip lunch or I’ll have some salty potato chips. Maybe I’ll have a granola bar? And then I’ll have dinner which varies, but is usually not diverse in nutrition. I don’t eat meat, it grosses me out. I don’t eat a lot of vegetables, it’s bad y’all.

I went to the doctor because the past few months I’ve been feeling absolutely lethargic and sick. I have lightheadedness, high heart rate, headaches, just a ton of weird stuff. They drew my blood a bit and said I was slightly anemic. They can’t find anything else that pointed to a bigger issue. I was wondering if anyone else struggled with vitamin deficiency because of their food aversions or lack of nutrients in diet? I have a bunch of vitamins in my cabinet that I really should be taking, but, procrastinating is my favourite pastime I guess.

1g66jne,https://i.redd.it/dlmgqnsd1fvd1.jpeg," ""It is what it is"" -- J. E. Lawrence • [Click to Expand]","## Let's chat about something we've all heard a million times: 

""It is what it is."" You know, that go-to phrase when life throws a curveball. But have you ever stopped to really think about what it means? 

So, this little gem of wisdom has been floating around for ages, but it got its big break in the 1940s thanks to a Nebraska journalist named J. E. Lawrence. Since then, it's become the ultimate verbal shrug – a way to acknowledge life's messiness without losing your cool.

Think about it. How often do you use this phrase in your day-to-day life? Maybe when your coffee order gets messed up or when you're stuck in traffic. It's like a verbal release valve, helping us let go of things we can't control.

But here's where it gets interesting. This simple phrase packs a philosophical punch. It's all about accepting reality as it is, not as we wish it to be. It's kinda zen when you think about it – very ""go with the flow.""

Now, some folks see it as a positive mantra. It's about rolling with the punches and not sweating the small stuff. Others might say it's a cop-out, an excuse to give up or not try to change things. I guess it depends on how you use it, right?

When life gets tough, these words can be a lifeline. They remind us that sometimes, we just need to accept things and move on. It's not about giving up; it's about conserving your energy for battles you can actually win.

Interestingly, this idea isn't unique to English. Many languages have their own versions. In Spanish, they say ""Así es la vida"" – ""Such is life."" It's a universal human experience, dealing with the unexpected and the unchangeable.

Personally, I've found myself leaning on this phrase more times than I can count. Like when plans fall through or things don't work out as expected. It's oddly comforting, a reminder that I'm not alone in facing life's curveballs.

You can't escape it in pop culture either. It's in movies, songs, memes – you name it. It's become a shorthand for a whole philosophy of life. But here's the thing: like any popular phrase, it can lose its meaning if we're not careful. It shouldn't be an excuse for inaction or indifference.

So why has this phrase stuck around for so long? I think it's because it captures something fundamentally human. We all struggle with accepting reality, especially when it's not what we want. ""It is what it is"" gives us a way to acknowledge our frustrations while also moving past them.

Next time you find yourself saying or hearing these words, take a moment to really think about what they mean to you. Are they helping you accept and move forward, or are they holding you back? Remember, sometimes acceptance is the first step towards positive change. Or maybe... it is what it is.

📖

## J. E. Lawrence 

was an American journalist who lived in the mid-20th century. He is most famously credited with popularizing the phrase ""It is what it is"" in print. 

Lawrence worked as a columnist for the Nebraska State Journal (now part of the Lincoln Journal Star) in Lincoln, Nebraska. His use of the phrase ""It is what it is"" appeared in a 1949 article about the challenging economic conditions that local farmers were facing due to a harsh winter.

Beyond this specific contribution to popular language, details about J. E. Lawrence's life and career are not widely known or easily verifiable. The exact dates of his birth and death, as well as more comprehensive information about his life and journalistic career, are not readily available in common historical records.

It's worth noting that while Lawrence is often credited with popularizing the phrase, the exact origin of ""It is what it is"" is debated, as similar expressions have existed in various forms across different cultures and time periods.

I never thought my relationship would end like this, but here’s my story.

I’ve been dating Jake for about a year. He was charming, attentive, and always seemed to have everything together. I fell for him hard, but there were little things that occasionally made me uneasy. For example, he often had “work meetings” that would last late into the night. He was vague about his job, claiming he worked in marketing.

One night, I got a text from a mutual friend, Sarah, asking if I was free for coffee. We hadn’t hung out in a while, so I happily agreed. While we were chatting, she casually mentioned seeing Jake out at a bar with another woman a few weeks ago. My heart dropped. I brushed it off, convincing myself it was a misunderstanding.

That night, I decided to confront him. When I asked about it, he laughed it off, claiming he was just out with coworkers. I wanted to believe him, but the seed of doubt was planted.

A few weeks later, I decided to surprise Jake at his apartment. I knocked on the door, but no one answered. I noticed his car was in the lot, so I waited. After about 20 minutes, I heard laughter coming from inside. My heart sank again. I knocked again, more urgently, but still nothing.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I peeked through the window. What I saw made my stomach drop: Jake was sitting on the couch with a woman I had never seen before. They looked cozy, sharing drinks and laughing. 

I felt a mix of rage and heartbreak. Instead of confronting them then, I decided to leave and gather my thoughts. I needed proof.

The next day, I did some digging and discovered his social media accounts. To my shock, I found pictures of him with this woman, tagged in posts dating back several months. It turned out they had been together longer than I’d known him.

I confronted Jake that evening. I asked him about the woman and his ""other life."" His face went pale, and he tried to deny it, but the evidence was overwhelming. He eventually admitted that he had been dating both of us at the same time.

I was devastated, but part of me felt relief for finally knowing the truth. I ended things right then and there, and I walked out, leaving him speechless.

Since then, I’ve been focusing on myself and rebuilding my life. I’ve learned to trust my instincts more and to never ignore the red flags. It’s been a tough lesson, but I’m determined to move on and find someone who truly values me.",12,1729213676.0,stories,4,0.8,False

To be clear I don’t really mind my bf catching up with a young female coworker over coffee. Ok I mind a little but I can move past it, we both have male and female friends, and I’ve caught up with male friends before. So I am aware it would be hypocritical if I was straight up against this, nor do I want to be against it, that’s not cool. 

But this situation seems off? TLDR his small company laid off a ton of people due to a failed deal. This coworker (let’s call her Jane) was an admin and helped my bf with client communication. Now that she (and literally the entire team besides 2 people) are gone, work is insane and my bf is crazy stressed, but also kind of relishing this new freedom and ownership from being one of the only few left standing.

But now he asked me if I would mind if he got coffee with Jane this weekend “to help her network and get her another job.” He first presented it to me as “I want to recruit her if we get the green light to hire again haha” and “I told [his boss] straight up if we get to hire again that she would be a top candidate in my eyes and he said the goodbyes we said to some of our departed employees are not necessarily forever.”

To clarify, my bf was not this lady’s manager, he does not manage others, and his position was only slightly above hers to the point there was enough overlap in their roles that he trained her when he got promoted. 

I responded saying I don’t think that’s appropriate, given he wouldn’t be the hiring manager and the company obviously isn’t hiring anytime soon. And if they wanted to keep her, they would have. So he’d be meeting her as a friend which is fine but also just say so? I also said “I didn’t realize you guys were still in contact or wanting to meet up. Which again I get and it’s fine but don’t pass it off as wanting to recruit her when that’s obviously not happening anytime soon. If you want her as a friend then again just say so, catching up over coffee is fine.” He said he is trying to keep the door open by networking and seeing if he can help her get a job. “She worked too hard and was too smart to be let go like that.”

So now my bf is angry at me for not taking him at face value. Maybe I’m not understanding the full context. I asked him “are there other people you are meeting with to network? There were a lot of smart people who shouldn’t have been let go like that. Does she want your help to get a job? Does it have to be you to help her?” He only said he’s reached out to a few people on LinkedIn to see if they want a reference. 

It is giving me white knight vibes, something he does A LOT and that I’ve expressed makes me uncomfortable. He’s always the one to go out of his way for anyone, not just women, but with women there is a distinctive “I must help/protect her” vibe. It gives me the ick but he’s working on it and ultimately I trust him and told him to do whatever he wants. However he still is upset with me.

I (18M) met this girl (19F) a few weeks ago through some mutual friends. She's cool and everything, but something happened that I didn’t think much of at first, and now it's just... strange.

We were hanging out at a café with some friends, and when it came time to order, she realized she didn’t have her wallet. It wasn’t a big deal to me at the time, so I just said, “No worries, I got it” and bought her coffee. She said thank you, and I honestly didn’t think twice about it.

The problem is, ever since then, she’s been asking me to buy her coffee every time we meet up. Like, she’ll text me, ""Hey, wanna grab coffee?"" and I’ll agree, but when we get there, it's always something like ""Oh, you got me last time,"" or ""You don’t mind, right?"" I’ve bought her coffee like 4 or 5 times now. 

I wouldn’t mind if it was every once in a while, but it’s becoming this unspoken thing where I’m just the guy who buys her coffee. It’s not like we’re dating or anything, we’re just friends (I think??). But I don’t want to come off as cheap or rude by saying no all of a sudden, but the thing is, I’m a college student and money’s kinda tight. Buying coffee for two every time adds up, you know? I don’t know if she’s being oblivious or if she’s taking advantage of the situation. Either way, I’m starting to feel a little uncomfortable with how it’s playing out, but I don’t know how to bring it up without making it awkward.

*— Donald Trump*

Explanation: Life never plays fair. One moment you’re cruising along, feeling invincible, and then BAM!—you spill coffee on yourself, your car won’t start, or suddenly you’re stuck in a Zoom meeting that should’ve been an email. What happens next? Some people just roll with it. They laugh, clean up the coffee, call a mechanic, and maybe send a meme to their coworkers about the Zoom disaster. Others? They spiral into a meltdown, cursing the universe like it personally conspired against their morning.

The truth is, winners aren’t these superhuman creatures who never face challenges. No, they just have this uncanny ability to stay cool, adapt, and even crack a joke while the world throws curveballs. Losers? Well, they tend to overanalyze the pitch and get hit in the face by the ball, metaphorically speaking. It’s all about perspective! Sure, life is throwing you into a blender sometimes, but hey, you might end up with a smoothie. Or at least, a funny story to tell.

Then i eventually realised that the items on the list weren't as important as the psychic shift i undergo when i use my gratitude list.

What are your thoughts on Gratitude. It's a fantastic tool.

So Grateful for AA.

Recently caught a fancy for milk based coffees and in my experience aeropress is not up to the mark for that. So decided to buy a mokapot. Now I want suggestions for coffee. For aeropress I use Attikan by BT. I have tried others too, but this one was the winner ",2,1729212815.0,IndiaCoffee,3,0.75,False

","In May, Camille Johnson, (General Relief Society President) spoke about how she chose to pursue a law career in direct opposition to the prophetic counsel of her day to stay at home with her children. (she said it was what she felt impressed to do) Let me repeat that - She FAILED to follow the prophets direct counsel and was rewarded with the highest office a woman can hold in the LDS church. This tells me that the requirement to be a stay at mom is over. If you want a career like your husband, you can have it, they can no longer say otherwise.

Today I also learned that garments will now have a sleeveless option. Wow! I was told all my life to cover my shoulders. Shoulders are 'porn' no more, and the church can no longer say otherwise.

What sacred cow is next? Coffee and tea? Worthiness interviews? Young women passing the sacrament? Gay marriage? Prophetic infallibility? Tithing?? I believe there will be more changes in the next 10 years as all the old and out of touch leaders die off and younger ones come in that try to keep the membership was leaving.",28,1729212791.0,mormon,12,0.92,False

Profile hits me up. Exchange face pics right away. Start the normal grindr convo. Hi. WYD. What you into? Etc etc. He sent two front nudes (no face) and I return it with two butt pics (I had no face in them). I ask if he wanted to get coffee. Didn't really sext that much. All I said was definitely would wanna taste you. And we can touch a Lil and feel the chemistry if it's there. But ask for coffee. He sent a location through grindr which was 30 mins away. Which was local. That's why I didn't pay no mind to it. Even though it was a random parking lot. Then it started to get fishy. I ask to video chat but said couldn't. Which I should've known from watching Catfish. Then I was like so the location you sent is a random parking lot. He said yeah he on the DL and we should met there and I can follow him back to his place. But that part made feel uneasy. So I just say Let's just met at the local dunkin next to it. He said sure gave me a number to call when I'm close. 

I was gonna bail cause my gut was like eh do you wanna put on pants and go out? But I was like what's do I have to lose. I'm not doing anything. So I headed out. 

Half way I called the number and it was a Google number. That's another flag. But I tried to justify it. He is on the DL. And I do have a Google number too to give out at the clubs. Called the number. Didn't pick up.  I open the app and texted. Hey gave you a called and it didn't work. He replied back sorry. And gave me another number. I called it and it was a regular number. But didn't pick up. Looking back it might of been a zoom number cause it was a DC area code. Anyways. I was gonna bailed cause I was waiting on him for a while. 

Then I got a text from that DC number was like hey are you there. I'm like yes. Where are you? No response. I was gonna respond back. And be like hey if you aren't close it's okay. We can bail etc. Then that's when my heart drop.

He texted my full name (mind you we never exchange names on grindr) and that is when I got scared. It was my name. FB profiles and 3 addresses associated with me. And he basically said don't fuck with me. Do as I say or I'm gonna message all your friends and family your nudes and our convos.  Your friends. Colleagues and family will see. And then proceed to send me screen shots of my Facebook profile and some on my friends list. And I got scared. And it shook me. 

So I didn't respond back at all and drove straight to the police station and ask to speak with a cop.  And explain the situation. I was embarrassed and more importantly didn't want anyone else to get involved. If it was just me that would be fine but i'm not fully out to my family and I don't want to be outted like this. Officer took down my story. Gave him the screen shots and numbers. And when I went to grindr to show our messages. It look like the profile blocked me cause the messages aren't there.  

I want to know your thoughts. This is my first time trying to meet someone IRL and I'm terrified. I'm embarrassed. I'm ashamed. I should've known better. What else should I do? I already made most my social private and deleted my FB. But I'm still on edge. 

Thank you for your advice and thoughts. Sorry for the Grammer mistakes and run on sentences. ",0,1729212555.0,askgaybros,3,0.5,False

Doomscrolling replaced video games, eating replaced booze. My windows of productivity are the unpredictable euphoric episode between the first and second pots of coffee, and the 1AM comedown. A day without anything and I’m beyond irritable, I’m actually catatonic. Completely cooked.

There’s no time for anything but I get nothing done. I’m constantly stressed. There’s a dull ache in my feet, hands, hips, and eyes. I can’t sleep anymore.

Half my family are functional alcoholics or potheads. For good measure, a cousin on the other, intelligent half is a tweaker. All indications suggest I’m genetically predisposed to throwing my life away. It’s my god-given right and life’s purpose.

Either this all clears up somehow or I’m going to end up on a TV program, I think.",32,1729212406.0,rs_x,8,0.98,False
