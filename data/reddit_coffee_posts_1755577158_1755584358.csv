1muakay,https://i.redd.it/3izabfyd5xjf1.jpeg,Low pressure,"Ive been using the rok for about a week and I can only get it to 1 bar of pressure. Process below:

17g coffee
Ground using kommondante on 8 clicks to produce espresso grind
Tamp down hard
Fresh coffee
Rok arms up for 15 seconds for pre infusion
Preheat all rok components 
Boiling water

I can't think of any more variables that might fix it other than faulty machine parts? I have noticed the basket doesn't sit central but I don't think that's an issue. Strangely I had one espresso that worked fine but I don't know what I did differently!

It‚Äôs a classic Italian roast. 

The package says that this is a medium roast but this means that for Italian standards we‚Äôre dealing with a ‚Äúlight‚Äù dark roast, so I didn‚Äôt take my chances and went straight to a coarse grind size (2.6.0 for those of
you with the JX PRO S).

The extraction was quite fast despite using the E&B lab filter, I also couldn‚Äôt avoid a bit of the vulcanic phase despite turning off the stove almost at half extraction, but the cup wasn‚Äôt affected: no harshness and bitterness.

I may want to grind finer to add some body, but this is a nice coffee.",2,1755584121.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

I've just built a cycling app that creates great road routes with a single click. The goal? Fun, scenic rides ‚Äî not just the shortest point A to point B.



**Here's how it works:**

1. Choose your distance (10‚Äì300 km) and whether it‚Äôs a loop or point-to-point.

2. (Optional) Pick a target elevation gain.

3. (Optional) Add sightseeing stops.

4. (Optional) Include natural springs to refill your bottles.



Hit ""Get Route"" ‚Äî and the magic happens. You get a custom route, ready to ride.

It's free for now. If you like it, you can buy me a coffee, send brutally honest feedback, or even help out.



**Why it's different from Komoot or Strava**

The secret is the algorithm and the data. I've got 10+ years of experience in advanced algorithms, and over the past year I've been collecting, cleaning, and enhancing cycling data.

The result? Routes optimized specifically for road cyclists: less traffic, smoother tarmac, better scenery.



**The idea came from two frustrations:**

1. Planning routes is a time sink ‚Äî especially checking traffic, road quality, and sights for a safe, pleasant ride.

2. I love discovering hidden gems while riding. But too often, they're just 100 meters off the path and I miss them. This app helps find them before I do.



If that sounds familiar, you'll probably love it too.

And if you find a critical bug, please report it ‚Äî you'll be my hero.



**The future roadmap:**

\- Gravel & MTB support

\- Direct export to Garmin, Strava, and Komoot (GPX download already available)

\- Your ideas here ‚Äî what would you like to see?



**Try it out and tell me what you think:**

We work in the same city. Our bedroom has a full size wardrobe with 2 sections, one for me, the other for her.

She's a little obsessed with organizing her things, but now she has started doing it with mine. Note that I like to keep things organized as well, but not that extreme. For example, I would leave the TV remote on the couch's armrest instead of the coffee table, but never on the bed.

She repeatedly shifts my trimmer to the lower drawer instead of letting me keep it in the top one. She puts  my laptop on the TV cabinet whenever I leave it on the bed table of my side. **There are hundreds of such little things that add up.** Sometimes, I end up wasting time looking for stuff, which is really frustrating. After working all day, people get only a small window to relax. Imagine spending that time searching for something you know you left on the table before going to the office.

I've told her a lot of times to not move my things to a less convenient place, just to match her Instagram aesthetics. It's a home, not a studio or house tour we see online. She says she would stop, but never changes. I even asked her if she needs any help.

Yesterday, she took out an old looking shawl from my wardrobe and gave it to the maid. It was a Persian shawl my dad gifted my mom around 30 years ago. An expensive item, both by money and sentiments. My mom used it a lot my whole childhood, so I've a lot of memories attached to it and hence kept it with me. But she basically threw it away.

This time, I couldn't hold it and shouted. All my anger and emotions came out. She got pissed as well and said that I'm being controlling since my parents own this flat. Currently, she isn't speaking to me. Neither I am.

I‚Äôve always had issues with oversleeping when growing up, and now it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm the opposite. If I can even sleep in an hour longer, I feel terrible and likely have a migraine for the rest of the day. 

A few times as a kid I‚Äôd wake up feeling absolutely magical, like I had been awake for hours and not groggy at all. 

A few months back, we had daylight savings and I didn‚Äôt set my alarm correctly. I woke up naturally and felt absolutely incredible. It was like that extra hour of sleep made me feel like I‚Äôd slept for years. I didn‚Äôt have the slightest feeling of grogginess or desire to go back to sleep at all. It was truly a weird but great experience that I‚Äôd imagine a lot of people feel when they‚Äôve had a perfect nights sleep. 

I‚Äôve tried going to be an hour earlier or getting up a bit later and can never seem to get this quality of sleep again. 

Is there supplements, tips or techniques I can use to try and achieve this again?

Benefits of Choosing a One Story Barndominium Over Traditional Homes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When considering housing options, many people find themselves exploring the advantages of unique designs like barndominiums. These stylish structures combine the rustic charm of traditional barns with modern living spaces. One of the standout designs among these is the one story barndominium. Opting for a one story barndominium comes with several benefits that many homeowners find appealing.

### Accessible Living

One of the most significant perks of choosing a one story barndominium is accessibility. These homes provide a single-level living experience, making it easier for everyone, including children and elderly family members, to navigate. Without stairs to worry about, residents can move freely, reducing the risk of falls or accidents. This is particularly beneficial for families with young kids or seniors looking to age in place.

### Cost Efficiency

A one story barndominium can be more cost-effective compared to traditional multi-level homes. Here‚Äôs why:

- **Lower Construction Costs:** Building a single story often requires fewer materials, which can significantly reduce overall expenses.
- **Energy Efficiency:** With no upper levels to heat or cool, these homes typically have lower energy requirements, leading to savings on monthly utility bills.
- **Maintenance Savings:** Single story homes generally require less maintenance over time, from roof repairs to exterior painting.

### Flexible Floor Plans

One story barndominiums offer remarkable flexibility in their floor plans, allowing homeowners to personalize their space fully. You can design your home to fit your lifestyle with an open concept layout that encourages social interaction. Whether you prefer a large kitchen island or spacious living areas, the possibilities are endless.

This type of design opens up several layout options, enhancing the flow of natural light throughout the home. It allows for larger windows and soaring ceilings, making your living space feel open and airy.

### Connection with Nature

Barndominiums are often designed with an emphasis on outdoor living. By building on one level, you can easily access outdoor spaces like patios or decks directly from your living areas. This seamless connection with nature encourages outdoor relaxation and entertainment with family and friends. Many homeowners appreciate the ability to enjoy morning coffee while taking in the views right outside their back door.

### Unique Aesthetics

Choosing a one story barndominium means you're stepping away from cookie-cutter designs. These homes can exude a distinctive style that stands out in traditional neighborhoods. The blend of metal siding with rustic wood accents offers a timeless appeal. You can customize the exterior to match your personal taste, whether that's a modern farmhouse look or a classic barn style.

### Lower Environmental Impact

Many barndominium builders are adopting eco-friendly practices, which can lead to a reduced environmental footprint. A one story design uses fewer resources, and because they are often constructed with sustainable materials, they promote a greener lifestyle. This is an attractive feature for those conscious of their impact on the planet and seeking energy-efficient living solutions.

### Quick Build Time

Compared to traditional homes, one story barndominiums can be constructed more rapidly. The simpler form and materials often translate to shorter build times. This speedy construction means homeowners can move into their new space sooner, avoiding extended periods of uncertainty and stress.

### Versatile Use

Another fantastic aspect of one story barndominiums is their versatility. The large, open spaces can be easily adapted for various purposes. Whether you want to create a workshop, a home office, or extra guest rooms, you can modify the layout according to your changing needs. This adaptability truly makes a one story barndominium a lifelong investment.

Selecting a one story barndominium offers numerous benefits over traditional homes. With distinct features such as accessibility, cost efficiency, flexible design options, and a unique aesthetic, it's easy to see why many families are drawn to make this choice. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a starter home or a forever space, the one story barndominium presents an attractive option that meets the diverse needs of modern living.

Choosing a one-story barndominium over traditional homes has numerous advantages. They typically require less maintenance, which means you can spend more time enjoying your space instead of tending to it. The single-level design is particularly appealing for those who prefer to avoid stairs, enhancing safety and promoting a leisurely lifestyle. Additionally, barndominiums often boast energy-efficient construction methods, reducing utility costs and environmental impact.

Kim held her left steady waiting. Her right kept up a steady pace of jabs as the hits came in. Kim dodged left and right bobbing and weaving until it connected. Franky threw his right as Kim blocked it with her left. A glint left her eye as her feet turned, shifting her into a counter punch. Kim‚Äôs right hand pushed past everything as it made contact with Franky‚Äôs headgear. ‚ÄúAlright that's enough for today, I'm actually afraid you might do some damage to me.‚Äù Kim bounced on her feet as she watched him exit the ring. Kim immediately started shadow boxing as Amber entered the gym. Amber just hung on the ropes watching.

‚ÄúShouldn't you be somewhere else?‚Äù Amber didn't respond to Kim's words. Kim just turned on her feet as the air followed her. Kim kept her eyes on her imaginary opponent. Amber picked up Kim's water taking a quick swig. Kim fell back leaning on the ropes. ‚ÄúHit me.‚Äù At Kim's command Amber squirted water into her mouth. 

‚ÄúI kinda got bored of stretching and wanted to see what my girl was up to.‚Äù Kim pulled herself off the ropes back into fighting position as Amber went on. ‚ÄúYou could use a break too, you know.‚Äù Kim kept one ear in the conversation as she sent a straight to nothing. ‚ÄúI mean I know you have this fight.‚Äù Kim bounced on her feet as she turned to Amber.

‚ÄúCan you do me a favor and leave?‚Äù Kim's stark words shut down Amber. Amber just turned away as her legs wobbled. ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Amber stopped as Kim reached through the ropes grabbing her. Kim turned Amber around as she kissed her. ‚ÄúI'll see you after of course.‚Äù Amber just giggled as she nodded trying to walk backwards out of the building. Kim crawled through the ropes as she sat on the edge of the ring picking up a dumbbell. Kim swigged her water as she alternated hands with the weight. Doom scrolling wasn't really in her present. Social media didn't exist in her world. Kim's social media was the girl of her dreams. Kim scrolled through her tests with Amber as she pulled her weight. Suddenly the urge to run came on cue. ‚ÄúFranky! I'm going on a run!‚Äù Kim pulled on her sleeveless hoodie as she pulled her hair out. 

‚ÄúPerfect timing! Take the new guy with you!‚Äù Kim raised a brow as she leaned to the left looking down the hallway. Franky‚Äôs words brought curiosity to Kim's face. 

‚ÄúYou didn't tell me there's a new recruit!‚Äù Kim turned the corner using her voice to ping Franky‚Äôs location. As she turned into his office Kim stopped. Standing next to Franky was Brandon from school. Kim's eyes shot up at him as Brandon turned away. 

‚ÄúYou two look like you've seen a ghost, you two go to the same school right?‚Äù Kim just nodded as Brandon remained quiet. ‚ÄúIt will make it easier for him to shadow you then,‚Äù Franky said, wiping the sweat off his face. Before Kim could protest Brandon spoke up.

‚ÄúShe's gonna be my what, my mentor?‚Äù Kim rolled her eyes as she crossed her arms. Franky just laughed.

‚ÄúThink of each other as stablemates, though she is your superior, try not to hurt him too much,‚Äù Franky said, nudging her shoulder as he left. Left standing in the dusty office was them. Kim stood at average size for her age in tight pants and a sleeveless hoodie with her curly red hair raining down her back. Brandon stood tall with her crooked frame and loose shorts. His tank top said it all.

‚ÄúIght you're with me, let's go do some roadwork.‚Äù Brandon just followed her out. 

‚ÄúRoadwork?‚Äù Rolling her eyes seemed like it was gonna be constant if all he had was more questions.

‚ÄúIt means to go for a run, now try and keep up.‚Äù Kim made it seem easy as she hit the sidewalk. Brandon stayed behind her some ways trying to keep up. Kim didn't break a sweat, she didn't struggle, she didn't even stop at lights. She just jogged in place.

‚ÄúI don't know how you do this,‚Äù Brandon said, trying not to pass out on the street. Kim circled on her feet as she took the air as an opponent.

‚ÄúI don't know why you decided to box all of a sudden.‚Äù Kim's stern words hit him hard as he fell to the floor sliding down a traffic light pole. Brandon watched her hands shoot through the air. He just laughed.

‚ÄúYou don't know?‚Äù Suddenly he stood up, slapping his chest. ‚ÄúI came here to make sure I didn't feel weak.‚Äù As the light flashed green the run started up again. Brandon tried his best to relay his words as he sprang on his feet. ‚ÄúI came here‚Ä¶.I came here to learn how to fight! So I could beat you up!‚Äù Kim turned her form as Brandon stopped to catch his breathing. Brandon gripped his knees as he waited for her to respond. Kim just bounced on her feet as she fought with the air.

‚ÄúThen do it.‚Äù Brandon pulled up his head as he watched her shadow box. Brandon could feel his hands close tight but all he could see was fists coming at him. Kim‚Äôs eyes rolled past him as she peered into the lonely strip mall. Brandon pulled himself up as he followed her eyes. He caught the bright window of the karate studio as Amber was in the middle of kicks. His eyes went limp as realization set in. He thought back to that day at lunch. ‚ÄúLearn how to fight, take me on, bet you can't.‚Äù Before Brandon could come up with the words Kim turned on her feet starting back up the run. This time she didn't wait up for him. Kim pulled all her things together as he dragged himself inside the gym. As she walked to the door he spoke.

‚ÄúWhy? Why do you box?‚Äù Kim gripped her duffle bag as she looked back at him. With gritted teeth and somber eyes she spoke. 

‚ÄúWhen I'm in the ring I feel like I'm in control.‚Äù And like that she was gone or at least she tried to only to just hang in the doorway as she watched Franky congratulate him on his first run. Kim just pulled herself away from the situation as it tried to grow in her head. Window-shopping was something Kim was a custom to when you own nothing. But there was something in this window she already owned. Kim watched Amber as she was sparring with another in her class. Amber was swift on her feet as she kept her distance from her opponent. Amber couldn‚Äôt play the violin in front of others but when she was on her feet she could do anything and Kim knew this. 

Kim patiently waited the ten minutes for Amber‚Äôs karate class to be over. They both found themselves on the curb waiting for the parents to arrive. Amber chewed on her nails as she scrolled through her phone. 

‚ÄúSo that asshole Brandon just showed up at the gym, I guess I'm kinda training him,‚Äù Kim said, laying back on the cement. Amber didn‚Äôt seem to even be fazed by the news. ‚ÄúHey are you listening?‚Äù Kim sat up pulling on Amber‚Äôs sleeve. Amber shifted putting down her phone. Kim‚Äôs frown finally got her attention. 

‚ÄúI um, yes I am, sowy I was looking at something, so Brandon wants to box?‚Äù Kim just laid back down as Amber pulled her hair behind her ears. Kim took a deep breath before rolling onto her side. 

‚ÄúThe reason Brandon hasn‚Äôt messed with you is because I roughed him up, that‚Äôs not to say you wouldn't have taken him, honestly I thought he was done for pissing you off.‚Äù Kim just watched the feet on the sidewalk as she hugged her dufflebag. ‚ÄúIt hurts to see him square up to you because you belong to me and no one messes with my property.‚Äù Kim felt tears somewhere inside her head but before they could make their daring escape Amber flipped Kim onto her back. The only thing between them was that dufflebag as Amber stared into Kim‚Äôs eyes. Amber slowly dragged her hand across Kim‚Äôs cheek. 

‚ÄúI think I need some protecting right now, what do you say?‚Äù Amber ran her thumb over Kim‚Äôs lips as she moved in close. Kim loosened her grip on the bag as Amber tossed it to the side. ‚ÄúOr this property might foreclose on you.‚Äù Amber just collapsed on Kim as their lips missed each other. Kim grabbed Amber by the shoulders as she flipped her over getting on top of her. Kim‚Äôs long red curls ticked Amber‚Äôs face as they kissed only to be interrupted by the horn of an incoming car. 

‚ÄúHey! What do you think you're doing!?‚Äù Kim pulled her head back as Brian‚Äôs voice shot out from the window of the car. Amber couldn‚Äôt help but laugh from the passenger seat as she observed the outburst. ‚ÄúGet off of her! Are you two arguing again? Did you hurt my daughter?‚Äù The area started to become a scene as Amber tried to pull her husband back a bit. Kim just sat on Amber's legs as she tried to figure out her words. 

‚ÄúUm Dad it‚Äôs not what it looks like,‚Äù Amber said, as she tried to shake off her growing redness. Brian was finally able to focus on the situation as he took it in. Amber whispered into his ear, filling him in as he tried to think of anything else. The girls just got in the car quickly. 

‚ÄúYou mean I was the last one to find out.‚Äù Brian rested his head on the steering wheel as he took in the news. Amber rubbed his back gently. 

‚ÄúMr. Fader I'm sorry we didn‚Äôt tell you, we thought it was obvious,‚Äù Kim roared as she clanged to the seat in front of her. Brian just started the car as he pinched his eyes together. ‚ÄúWe promise we're behaving under your roof.‚Äù Brian looked back at them with wide eyes. 

‚ÄòAhh! I wasn‚Äôt even thinking of that but now I am!‚Äù Brian just shook his head as got onto the highway. ‚ÄúThink about what people will say, you let your daughter live with her girlfriend.‚Äù The girls had nothing to say, they just listened. 

‚ÄúWell at least it‚Äôs not a boy in the house.‚Äù Amber‚Äôs words did not calm the situation. Brian pulled into their dirt driveway quickly as he pulled to a stop. There was complete silence for a total of five minutes before Brian spoke. 

‚ÄúOk ok, I'm not mad at you two I just don‚Äôt want anything bad to happen, you two aren‚Äôt spending the night in each other‚Äôs rooms are you?‚Äù Brian flipped around eyeing them with his question. The girls just shook their heads. As Brian unlocked the doors Amber and Kim dragged themselves to the ground as their hands intertwined. 

‚ÄúOh my God I thought your dad was gonna ground us or something, he‚Äôs kinda scary,‚Äù Kim said, as Amber kissed her cheek. The girls giggled as they walked through the front door. 

‚ÄúOh no, grounding us in this house together would be so bad.‚Äù Amber pulled themselves up the stairs with her sarcastic voice. The girls burst into Amber‚Äôs room as Sam sat up curious as their playful moods. ‚ÄúDad caught us together, he‚Äôs kinda freaking out right now,‚Äù Amber said, pulling Kim into bed with her. 

‚ÄúWow and here I thought two women together would be easier on his tiny little heart.‚Äù Sam sat up in bed as she tried to picture Brian going off on them. ‚ÄúProbably doesn't help that you two are canoodling under his roof.‚Äù Kim and Amber shhhhhsed her as they pulled the blanket over each other scrolling through their phones. 

‚ÄúJust wait till your parents hear about your boyfriend.‚Äù Amber‚Äôs words pulled Sam‚Äôs face to the bed as she crawled to the edge. 

‚ÄúAhh, I don‚Äôt have a boyfriend!‚Äù Sam‚Äôs panicked face hid in her blanket as she dragged herself to the floor. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say that you're gonna jinx everything!‚Äù Sam walked on her knees across the room. Sam looked like she was praying for a miracle. Amber raised the blanket as the girls peaked out at the religious statue in front of them. 

‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you just told him how you feel?‚Äù Amber‚Äôs question churned Sam‚Äôs stomach as she pulled her blanket over her head. Telling someone how you feel was the simplest and hardest thing a person could ever do especially for a fifteen year old girl. 

‚ÄúJus text him and ask him on a date or something.‚Äù Sam didn‚Äôt like Kim‚Äôs suggestion. She just stared at her phone screen thinking of what to do. 

‚ÄúEasy for you to say, you two have been in an on and off relationship for years, and not to mention all the pent up emotion between you too.‚Äù The girls pulled up the blanket again to check on Sam‚Äôs sanity. 

‚ÄúGood point, could you leave the room so we could use some of that pent up emotion.‚Äù Amber‚Äôs joking words angered Sam as she got up pulling the blanket off of them. Sam grabbed both of them by their hair as she pulled tight. As the girls fought for freedom the door burst open. 

‚ÄúOh sorry I forgot to knock.‚Äù Sam quickly let go of their hair as Amber pushed herself inside. ‚ÄúSam, could you give us a minute?‚Äù Sam stood up high on her toes as she ballerina walked out of the room. Sam closed the door slowly behind her only for Amber to flip around opening the door. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt ease drop.‚Äù Sam rolled her eyes as she pulled herself down the stairs sliding her arms down the rail. Amber and Kim stayed close together as Amber pulled up a chair. ‚ÄúListen me and your father are not mad, just do us a favor and keep the pda to a minimum around your father.‚Äù Amber kissed her daughter on the forehead before hugging them both. As she walked to the door she stopped turning back. ‚ÄúKim, this isn't your room?‚Äù Kim shot up as she grabbed her stuff following her out of the room. ‚ÄúOh dinner in ten both of you.‚Äù The cuddles and kisses just continued over the phone with a wall between them. 

Soon dinner was upon them. Fried chicken and mash potatoes were a favorite amongst households this one included except for the one plate sitting sad with boiled chicken and green beans. Kim however did not complain as she watched an entire family scarf down their greasy meal. 

‚ÄúI do say, all you kids sure are busy with all your hobbies and such.‚Äù Dave pointed his fork at each one of the kids. ‚ÄúI can't remember what I used to do for fun.‚Äù As Dave tried to remember another time his daughter snuck up behind him. 

‚ÄúThe only fun you've ever had is being stuck under a car!‚Äù Kitty shouted as she grabbed her father by his head. Everyone lit up as Kitty and Lucas entered the house.

‚ÄúHey, how was the trip?‚Äù Sam sat up on her knees trying to get her aunt's attention. Kitty pulled out a chair as she eyed the food. 

‚ÄúDaniel quit, said driving a monster truck was too dangerous for him, besides all that we stopped at this beautiful little pier for lunch.‚Äù As Kitty went on Lucas pulled open his back. 

‚ÄúAnd found the nicest little spot selling these little keychains,‚Äù Lucas chimed in as he pulled out three little keychains with teddy bears on them. Amber and Sam held up their presents as Kim just stared at it in her hand. 

‚ÄúThanks we love them!‚Äù Amber and Sam belted out with their thanks as Kim just sat quietly thinking. And then suddenly everyone was looking at her.

‚ÄúThank you for the gift.‚Äù The whole table smiled as Kim stuffed the keychain in her pocket. Kim focused on her food as conversation continued around the table. Once she was done eating it was time for another run. Kim just put in her headphones as she hit the dirt. Everything escaped her consciousness as she focused on her breathing. The music took over as the sun said goodbye. Kim kept her pace as she flipped around on the country road. She didn't move far from the sight of houses and made sure her phone was being tracked at all times. Amber could even see exactly where she was on her phone, not that she needed to as she watched her from the balcony. Kim circled back a couple of times before heading back inside to shower. The water kept her at peace and when it was finally over it was time for bed. Kim pulled her tank top over shorts as she ran her towel over her head. As Kim stepped out the bathroom fate opened the door across from her as Amber walked into the hall. Amber‚Äôs eyes popped as she noticed the eyeful in front of her. Kim just stood drying her hair with the towel before looking up from the floor. As they met eyes Kim just smiled before kissing the air. Amber‚Äôs legs went weak as Kim went inside her room. 

Seven hours on the dot was Kim‚Äôs sleep schedule. She was up early. Another run in the cold air. Everyone was asleep in the house except for one. Sofia was on the front porch drinking her coffee. 

‚ÄúYou know when I was your age the last thing that was on my mind was a run,‚Äù Sofia said, leaning over the banister watching Kim walk back to the house. Sofia just clenched her mug as the cold air kissed her face. Kim was about to walk right inside but something inside her was enough to make her stop. Kim turned around as she rested her hands on the railing. ‚ÄúMust be hard on you living in a new environment like this.‚Äù Kim just pointed her eyes into the dirt. 

‚ÄúWhat was it like for you at my age?‚Äù Sofia smiled at the question lobbed at her. Sofia turned around resting her back on the rail. With a big sigh she spoke. 

‚ÄúYour age? Wow was that some time ago.‚Äù With a another sip of coffee she went on. ‚ÄúWhere would I even begin, I had to share a room with Brian, I was failing at relationships, and lets not forget the creep pretending to be my friend who was apparently roughing up Brian behind my back, Brian never told me for some strange reason, can you believe that? Like he was protecting me or something.‚Äù Sofia blew her hair out of her face as she drank her coffee. ‚ÄúLets move this to the car, you gotta get to the gym early right?‚Äù 

All Kim could think about was the headache coming her way. Sofia started going on about the time she skipped school. Everyone's life seemed different to Kim, much different then her‚Äôs especially. As the car pulled up to the gym Sofia wished her a good day. The street was empty except for the people using it as a residency. As Kim entered the building a couple fighters said their good mornings. Franky had a bowl of noodles and rice ready for her. 

‚ÄúOk ok, here we are, breakfast is ready, oh and takes these they will clean you out.‚Äù Franky tossed her some pills. As Kim shook the bottle Brandon stepped out of the hallway. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the pills?‚Äù Kim had to explain to Brandon how the weigh in works and the preparation before hand. Kim took to pills before downing her food. Brandon just watched as she picked up her dumbbells. ‚ÄúShoudn‚Äôt you be resting today?‚Äù Brandon truly knew nothing about boxing. She just ignored him as she curled her weights. Brandon sat on the edge of the ring following her lead. He immediately went for a weight in both hands. He could not keep up with her. Once Kim felt pumped up she moved to the speed bag. Brandon put down the weights as he watched her. ‚ÄúI'm not pathetic you know.‚Äù Kim ignored him as she hit her bag. Brandon got up as he circled her. Before he could speak again someone cut in.

‚ÄúHey what's with the face little girl, tomorrow is your big fight you gotta look more excited.‚Äù Kaito grabbed the punching bag as Kim moved around to it. He held it still as her hits connected. He pulled back his slick black hair. ‚ÄúI've seen the girl you're fighting and she's nothing compared to you.‚Äù Kim smiled as she looked around the bag. Kaito raised his hands as she threw punches into his palms. 

‚ÄúShouldn't you be training for your next match?‚Äù Kim asked as they lightly spared. Katio went on about his intense training as he circled her. Once Kim threw a soil punch Katio pulled her into a headlock. 

‚ÄúYou think you can take me, now look what we have here,‚Äù Katio said, noticing Brandon standing there. He dropped Kim as he pulled Brandon into a headlock. ‚ÄúSo Kim this is your junior huh? I hear he‚Äôs a real upstart.‚Äù Brandon tried his best to break but was trapped in sculptured muscle. The struggling finally signaled Katio to let go. Brandon just mean mugged him as he walked back. ‚ÄúWow look at the tenacity on him, give an opponent those eyes and he might throw in the towel.‚Äù Katio just laughed himself to exhaustion as he headed for the showers. Brandon just dropped his eyes as Kim continued her punches.

‚ÄúI'm not pathetic!‚Äù The whole gym turned as Brandon punched the table in front of him. Kim couldn't tell if he was talking to her or himself. Before anyone in the gym could intervene Kim held up her hand signaling everything was fine. ‚ÄúThat's what you said to me, you called me pathetic.‚Äù Kim just pulled up a towel wiping the sweat off her neck.

‚ÄúProve it, get in the ring with me.‚Äù Kim picked up her gloves as Franky ran out of the back room. 

‚ÄúOh no, you have a match tomorrow!‚Äù Kim just bounced on her feet as she entered the ring. She almost completely ignored Franky as he climbed the side of the ring shaking his fists. 

‚ÄúHelp him with his gloves, one round, let's go.‚Äù There was no talking sense to her. Franky just gave in as he grabbed Brandon gloves. Brandon was speechless as Franky set him up. He seemed lost in the moment in a completely opposite way from Kim. Kim stayed loose on her feet while Brandon was stiff. Once the go was given Brandon lifted his gloves. Kim just watched his movements. Brandon stepped forward as Kim moved in close. A right then a left and even a hook came out of Brandon. Kim dodged and blocked all of it. His frustration grew as she stayed relaxed. Kim raised her left hand blocking just about every punch. There was a glint in her eye with every contact. Just as he threw another tired punch she blocked it and brought up her right hand pushing it through the air. As her fist got close to his face a bell rang.

1mu9wjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmileBetterCommunity/comments/1mu9wjb/teeth_whitening_options_by_the_best_dentists_in/,Teeth Whitening Options by the Best Dentists in Pune,"A bright, white smile is often associated with confidence, health, and beauty. Over time, teeth can lose their natural shine due to factors like aging, lifestyle habits, and food choices. If you‚Äôve been searching for professional **teeth whitening options** to restore your radiant smile, visiting an experienced [Dentist in Pune](https://g.co/kgs/ARvpQrU) is the best step forward. Modern dentistry offers safe, effective, and long-lasting solutions for teeth whitening that go far beyond over-the-counter products.

In this guide, we‚Äôll explore the top teeth whitening treatments recommended by experts, their benefits, and how to choose the right option for your needs.

# Why Do Teeth Lose Their Natural Whiteness?

Teeth discoloration is a common concern for many people. The most frequent causes include:

* **Dietary Habits** ‚Äì Regular consumption of coffee, tea, wine, or cola can stain enamel.
* **Smoking and Tobacco Use** ‚Äì Nicotine and tar darken teeth over time.
* **Aging** ‚Äì The enamel thins naturally, exposing more of the yellow dentin beneath.
* **Poor Oral Hygiene** ‚Äì Plaque buildup and tartar make teeth appear dull.
* **Medications** ‚Äì Certain antibiotics or treatments can cause intrinsic discoloration.

Understanding the cause helps dentists recommend the most effective whitening solution.

# Professional Teeth Whitening Options

Dentists in Pune offer advanced whitening treatments that are safe, customized, and give better results compared to home kits. Here are the top options:

# 1. In-Office Professional Whitening

This is the most popular and effective whitening treatment. Dentists use high-grade bleaching agents like hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, often activated with special lights or lasers.

**Benefits:**

* Instant results in just one sitting.
* Up to 8 shades lighter.
* Safe and controlled by a professional.

Best for people who want quick, noticeable results before an event or special occasion.

# 2. At-Home Professional Whitening Kits

Dentists provide customized whitening trays and professional-grade gels for at-home use. These are safer and more effective than store-bought products.

**Benefits:**

* Convenient and easy to use.
* Gradual whitening over 1‚Äì2 weeks.
* Less sensitivity compared to some in-office options.

This option is ideal for those who prefer flexibility and a gradual transformation.

# 3. Laser Teeth Whitening

Laser whitening is a high-tech treatment where a bleaching gel is applied, and a laser beam activates the whitening process.

**Benefits:**

* Fast, effective, and highly precise.
* Long-lasting results with proper care.
* Reduces the risk of gum irritation.

Perfect for individuals seeking cutting-edge whitening solutions.

# 4. Internal Bleaching (For Root Canal Treated Teeth)

Sometimes, teeth become discolored after root canal treatment. Internal bleaching involves placing a whitening agent inside the tooth.

**Benefits:**

* Specifically targets deeply stained teeth.
* Restores uniformity in smile.

# Over-the-Counter Whitening Options: Do They Work?

Supermarkets and pharmacies are filled with whitening toothpastes, strips, and rinses. While these can remove surface stains, they are limited in effectiveness compared to professional treatments.

* **Whitening Toothpaste** ‚Äì Works on mild stains but not effective for deep discoloration.
* **Whitening Strips** ‚Äì Offer temporary improvements but may cause sensitivity if overused.
* **Charcoal Products** ‚Äì Often marketed as natural, but excessive use can erode enamel.

These options may work as short-term maintenance, but for lasting results, consulting a qualified [Dentist near me](https://g.co/kgs/ARvpQrU) is highly recommended.

# How to Choose the Right Whitening Option

When selecting a whitening treatment, consider:

* **Cause of Discoloration** ‚Äì Surface stains vs. internal discoloration.
* **Budget** ‚Äì Professional in-office whitening may cost more but delivers instant results.
* **Sensitivity Issues** ‚Äì Some patients may need gentler options.
* **Longevity of Results** ‚Äì Professional treatments typically last longer with proper care.

Your [Dentist in Kothrud](https://g.co/kgs/ARvpQrU) can help customize a plan based on your needs.

# Expert-Backed Tips for Maintaining White Teeth

Whitening is just the first step. To maintain your bright smile:

* Brush and floss regularly to prevent plaque buildup.
* Rinse after drinking coffee, tea, or wine.
* Avoid smoking and tobacco.
* Visit your dentist for professional cleaning every six months.
* Use a straw for beverages that can stain.

But you know lately, I've been focusing on really small, almost boring things like actually drinking water before coffee, taking 10 minute walk or just sitting quietly with no agenda. Funny enough to think, these ""tiny"" things have made me feel more grounded than any big self care plan I've tried. 

I'm wondering, what's the smallest self - care habit that's made a surprising difference for you? ",13,1755581709.0,selfcare,1,1.0,False
1mu9tv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/goodomens/comments/1mu9tv7/ambivalence_about_the_coffee_theory/,Ambivalence About the Coffee Theory,"Ok, so, I think we were *all* devastated with the way season two ended. For almost the whole season (except those cursed ten minutes at the end of episode six, if you know, you know) it was really sweet and heartwarming and fun, and gave us a lot more insights into the characters of Aziraphale and Crowley, (and other characters as well but this post is focused on the two of them). 

Anyway, the topic at hand is *The Coffee Theory.* At the end of episode six, the Metatron gives Aziraphale a cup of coffee, which he drinks, and then, shortly after, we have Aziraphale and Crowley‚Äôs heart wrenching conversation (and ensuing kiss) at the bookshop, and then the moment when they say goodbye. It‚Äôs safe to say I‚Äôve never had a season finale affect me *that much* before. So, naturally, I fell down the Good Omens rabbit hole. And, naturally, one of the first (and most prominent) things I saw was *The Coffee Theory,* which posits that the cup of coffee that the Metatron gave Aziraphale had something in it, something that made Aziraphale more susceptible to the Metatron‚Äôs influence, basically. 

Now, as the title of this post says, I‚Äôm sort of ambivalent about this theory. I neither love or hate it, as I have reasons both for liking and disliking it. 

In the series, one of the central themes is that of defying fate, and being who *you* are, rather than being who *someone else tells you to be.* Both Crowley and Aziraphale have that as essential parts of their characters, with Crowley not wanting to do bad things as a demon, and with Aziraphale not wanting to follow the directions of Heaven with blind loyalty. They both *question things,* and that‚Äôs part of what makes their characters so compelling. 

It *also* leads into one of the main reasons I‚Äôm ambivalent about *The Coffee Theory.* With that individuality being *such a key part of Aziraphale‚Äôs identity,* the idea of the Metatron taking that away feels both like a backslide for Aziraphale‚Äôs character, and the independent nature that‚Äôs so essential to his identity, while at the same time seeming oddly poetic. Heaven punished Crowley for asking questions by sending him down to hell, and turning him into a demon, effectively pushing him out, pushing him away. They punished him for his curiosity by abandoning him and leaving him with unanswered questions, which was *literal torment* for him. But what if for Aziraphale, who treasured his independence, and his individuality, and his life on earth‚Ä¶what if Heaven punished him for his disobedience in a *different* way, by taking away his free will, by taking away the place he loved (earth) and forcing him to go back to the gilded cage that is Heaven?

Now, I know there‚Äôs a lot more to unpack with this, such as the emotional complexity of the kiss, Aziraphale asking Crowley to go with him to Heaven, and Aziraphale‚Äôs smile in the elevator to Heaven but for the sake of trying to have even a *little bit* of brevity in this post, I‚Äôll save those discussions for a future post. Anyway, if other people have different thoughts and opinions on why they do or don‚Äôt like the coffee theory, I‚Äôd love to hear them!",1,1755581702.0,goodomens,0,1.0,False

Basically I‚Äôve been assigning points to all of my habits:

**Examples:**

* Workout: +20
* Study: +20
* Meditate in the morning: +5
* No porn/gooning: +5
* Walk: +1
* Cold shower: +1
* Clean room: +1

For the bad habits (Don‚Äôt watch porn/goon) if I do then I lose points.¬†

You get the picture. Basically my habits/tasks become a game. Then when these points add up I spend them on rewards weekly and monthly.¬†

**Rewards:**

* Watch anime: 50 XP
* Ubereats: 75 XP
* Snacks: 50 XP
* Kobe basketball shoes: 400 XP
* Japan trip: 1000 XP

And so on. This is simple but it‚Äôs actually made my daily routines more enjoyable and fun. One thing I didn‚Äôt foresee is that this has¬†

helped me save money. Before I used to spend a lot of money on coffee, buying snacks, going out to eat. But now, I don‚Äôt do it unless I‚Äôve earned enough points. And this system has helped me break bad habits because they have immediate consequences.¬†

[The White Rabbit]

""Well, I've torn it"", I thought to myself (I didn't *think* I'd said any of that aloud), trudging back to my post on the deck. I'd given the tongue-lashing of a lifetime to one of my professors, my ship's Doctor, and a war robot and a lady who were probably innocent in what had happened. *Probably.*

Even just pissing off one of my most irascible professors and wrecking my grade would have been enough, and it could destroy everything my family had gotten together to send me to Centralia University, but a ship's Doctor is *never* someone you want to mess with if you like staying alive on that ship. And I'd involved the innocents as well.

I'd fucked up, and I hung my head as I trudged back toward the bridge of a ship I wasn't truly in command of.

This wasn't going to be a good flight for me, but I *had* to make it good for everyone else.

""Hey kid,"" a voice said, and I was suddenly pulled into a cabin by my shirt collar - OW FUCK! the lights burned my eyes when my antagonist suddenly turned them on, and I spent a while blinking while my eyes tried to readjust.

""I think you handled that *way* better than I would have,"" the voice said, and then I realized it was our Nominal Captain, Skyfall Sam, ""have a seat, and do you prefer coffee, tea, or something else? Don't worry, I just set the watches up so you've got some time off right now.""

""Enough time I could just take the bunk instead and have a nap?"" I asked, and heard Sam laughing alongside a very obviously Crocodilian laugh. My eyes started to really adjust, as I managed to make it onto a chair, and saw that ...I *think* his name was Santiago? Oh fuck, ""Slayer Santiago?"" A massive Crocodilian, was sitting across a table from Sam. There weren't any bunks in the room.

And they were playing a card game I didn't recognize.

""If I'd known it would hit you *that* hard,"" Santiago said, looking at me as he laid his hand of cards facedown on the table, ""I wouldn't have pulled the trick with the lights. Sorry about that.""

""Yeah, well,"" Sam said, ""you know my wife! You should know what that does to Lagomorphs!""

""I'm not getting pulled into another fight today! Tonight! This afternoon! Whatever time it is right now!"" I yelled at the pair, standing on the chair instead of sitting in it. You know, when confronting beings six or seven feet tall, every inch counts.

The Crocodilian laughed again, and said ""you can sit down,"" to me, and ""I see why you made *him* 'Acting Captain'"" to Sam. I did sit, because that was a bit more comfortable, and I felt a strange sense of respect? (I wasn't sure) from the two. Sam seemed to have reasons beyond getting out of a job to designate me as Acting Captain, but I wasn't sure if that was just because he was a shit Captain, although he had praised me on my management of a situation that could have become deadly, but Santiago chiming in with approval...

""Dude,"" Santiago told me ""*you* are the ***WHITE FUCKIN' RABBIT*** and absolutely dominated that airspace like it was your backyard, when we would have died if our opposition had managed to keep an interceptor or a fighter or a helicopter in the air for more than the half a second you gave them!""

I generally don't like being called ""rabbit"" or ""bunny"", but my moniker *was* ""The White Rabbit"", and Santiago -

""Man,"" Sam said, ""you saved our lives. You saved multiple starships' worth of lives that day. You defeated the local air/space force and its illegal counterparts *singlehandedly* - although I'm pretty sure that's figurative instead of literal, unless you were actually beating off in that cockpit.""

""Is that why humans give it that name, '***cock***pit'?"" Santiago asked *almost* innocently.

Sam laughed and told him no - and that the real origins of the name were more disturbing.

Their banter gave me a bit of time to catch my, well, breath and thoughts, and all of it. I mean I didn't have it all in a firm grip or anything, but 'Skyfall Sam' and 'Slayer Santiago' were saying I'd saved their lives and fully earned the right to my own title: 'The White Rabbit' while saving a ton of others in the process. Yeah, that light trick had been a bit mean, but... what the hell?

My reverie was broken into by Sam.

""You are the 'Acting Captain' on this starship because you're one of the best three pilots I've ever seen fly,"" Sam said to me, looking very intense, ""and the only one of those three who's *still alive*. And because I suspected you could do what you just did in that hallway,"" he continued, with a bit less intensity, but it was still obvious he *meant* it, ""you gave a complete dressing-down to your professor, who happens to be a giant tiger, to the Ship's Doctor, who happens to be aug'd to hell and back, to a war robot that a large portion of the galaxy would shit themselves in fear at the mere sight of that silhouette, let alone facing down one in person, and you know what you did, kid?""

""I told them exactly why their behavior would not be tolerated on this ship,"" I said, as calmly as I could, because I could feel my blood rising.

""You told 'em quite a bit more than that, kid,"" Santiago said, and then leaned forwards toward me ""but I definitely won't say what you said was wrong. They were out of line and needed the Captain to stop it and tell them *why*,"" and he leaned back in his chair, and sipped a cup of tea, ""and you did. You did it *hard*,"" (as a Leporidae, such a compliment from a Crocodilian with a mouth full of teeth that could immediately end my life was ...something), ""and you did it *fast*, and I don't mean you rushed your words or anything idiotic like that, I mean you were actually concise and to the point"".

""You did a good job, kid!"" they both said nearly in chorus.

That conversation, as bizarrely as it started (can a conversation start more bizarrely than with getting dragged into a dark room by an unseen hand and the getting flashbang'd by the room lights?), ended up being what I needed to stride back out onto the deck as the 'Acting Captain' and demand immediate reports from all stations, while relieving the Helmsman, since he was a worse pilot than I was and needed some sleep, so I immediately relieved him.

The reports I got were less than wonderful, since we were flying *half a ship*, but weren't as bad as what I'd dealt with and yelled at in the hallway less than an hour ago.

My initial problem was switching lifestyle and this made everything a thousand times more difficult. I started working from home, less walks, my work is almost around the clock, I have a kid (which made me give up on gym as my kid is still very young and requires a lot of care, no village) and in this scenario I often began to snack tiny things but through the whole day as stress relief or out of boredom. 

So I cut my snacking. I increased veggies. 
No weight loss. 

I got a treadmill that most times I only use Sunday for 1h. Because again, no time. I legit want to drop dead at end of day, I am sleeping less and less and feel always very tired now, going to bed later and later. 

My day yesterday was quite usual so I give an example: morning, I always have coffee with a splash of nut milk and a tiny spoon of sugar. I also have sometimes a slice of any dark bread with a thin spread of cream cheese or just ham if I wake up hungry, which wasn't the case yesterday. 

Before lunch I had 2 small peaches because I was starving and lunch would be later than usual. 

Lunch, I had a bit of rice and a chicken leg, roasted in oven. 

Mid afternoon, another coffee like at breakfast, I actually bite twice or 3x my husband chocolate croissant, which I know I shouldn't have. 

Dinner, I finished off the chicken leftovers, which was half a chicken leg, and I had 2 pizza crusts from my husband plate (homemade, it's pretty much simple bread dough, and was just ""dirty"" with the pizza tomato sauce). 

Through the day, sometimes I have more snacks, like sometimes my kid gives me a cookie. Not a whole pack. I must be eating calories hiding in something,because I have no idea how the weight is not dropping. It makes me feel like giving up when I'm feeling hungry, having headaches and then I step at the scale and nothing changed. Almost makes me want to accept it and move on. 

I know sometimes this happens, I came from office starving, had to buy groceries on my way back home and decided to buy this sort of mini tart with yogurt filling, thinking it was just a good choice. I checked myfitnesspal app and it was very heavy on calories.... I legit thought it wasnt over 200cal top.... Face-palm...

I know a lot of people would say that it‚Äôs just a phase but I don‚Äôt think a lot of people would understand. He is not only my boyfriend, but also my best friend. I feel like i lucked out so much when it comes to him and we both talked about our futures together. I‚Äôm not worried he‚Äôll cheat on me, as I know he‚Äôs not the type to do that. He has no interest in partying in college, nor has he ever touched any alcohol, or anything smoking related. What I‚Äôm worried about is how I‚Äôm going to last 4 months before he comes back for winter break(he‚Äôll leave again after about 2 weeks) We did everything together and now everything I do makes me think of how much I miss him, and how much I miss doing everything with him. This could include simple things such as watching tv, making dinner, or just simply talking. We‚Äôve managed to keep in touch every day, but only for about 30 minutes worth of texting, and maybe a 30 minute facetime call, which is actually more than I thought it would be, but everything I was worried about before him leaving is actually happening.

I can‚Äôt seem to find anything to do, and no matter what I do, I always find myself feeling sad.

I‚Äôm a huge baseball fan, so I combined that with tech and started hacking on mlbweeklyai.com ‚Äî a site that posts daily MLB recaps, tracks team/fanbase leaderboards, and experiments with AI-generated content. It‚Äôs a little bit blog, a little bit Reddit, a little bit fantasy-baseball tracker.

I‚Äôve been doing it solo ‚Äî no cofounder, no marketing team, no funding. Just me, Django, some late nights, and way too much coffee.

Some lessons that might resonate if you‚Äôre bootstrapping something:
‚Ä¢ Pick a niche you love. Baseball makes debugging at 1AM actually kind of fun.
‚Ä¢ Shipping > perfection. My first launch was ugly. People still used it.
‚Ä¢ Gamify if you can. The leaderboard idea turned out to be the most engaging feature.
‚Ä¢ SEO is slow. But writing consistent posts has been paying off ‚Äî I‚Äôm starting to see organic traffic trickle in.
‚Ä¢ Community > ads. Reddit and Twitter have been 100x more valuable than any ad spend.

I‚Äôm nowhere near ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù yet, but it feels good to see something I built getting clicks, comments, and even criticism.

1mu9ir5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mu9ir5/on_the_other_side_pt1/,On The Other Side PT.1,"The bathroom mirror was a severe judge. It's cheap, with a plastic frame that held a sheet of glass that seemed to highlight every flaw. The paint on the wall behind it, a dull, off-white, was chipped in places, with small flakes stubbornly clinging to the edges like dry, peeling skin.


  I splashed cold water onto my face, the sudden shock doing little to clear the persistent fogginess that clung to my thoughts, a haze that seemed to have settled permanently behind my eyes.
  

  My reflection, a gaunt, unremarkable man with perpetually tired eyes and hair that always looked slightly disheveled, stared back. I lifted my left hand, poised over the basin, fingers splayed. My reflection mirrored the movement, but then, a flicker‚Äîa subtle, almost unnoticeable hesitation. My hand completed its arc, but the reflection‚Äôs hand seemed to stutter, a fractional beat behind, like a poorly synced video playing on a cheap screen.


  A cold prick, like a tiny insect crawling, prickled the back of my neck. I froze, my breath catching in my throat. I blinked hard, then rubbed the sleep from my eyes with enough force to make them water.


  Fatigue, I reasoned, was simply a byproduct of another restless night spent staring at the ceiling, chasing the faint hum of the refrigerator or the distant drone of motorway traffic, anything to distract from the louder, more unsettling hum of my anxieties. I tried again, this time more slowly, deliberately raising my right hand. The reflection, now, was perfectly synchronized. Just tired, I told myself, a whisper of a lie I repeated often, a desperate attempt to explain away the unsettling occurrence. But the unease lingered, a faint, sour taste in my mouth, like yesterday‚Äôs coffee.


  My apartment, a rental I‚Äôd found online in a rush a year ago, was less a home and more a temporary stopping point. It was a monument to the plain and uninspired, a testament to a life lived on the sidelines, carefully avoiding any real connection or emotional investment.


  The living room, a sparse space painted a dull beige, held a perpetually dusty sofa that had long lost its shape, sinking inward as if tired of existence. Across from it, a small, old television sat on a wobbly stand, feeling more like a piece of unused furniture than a source of entertainment; I rarely bothered to turn it on.


  The windows, thick with a fine layer of urban dust that seemed to laugh at my half-hearted attempts to clean them, filtered the already weak morning sun into an everlasting twilight, casting long, dull shadows across the thin, worn carpet.


  There were no personal touches. No framed photos on the walls, no bright cushions on the sofa, no stacks of well-loved books on the cheap, imitation-wood coffee table. My few belongings, a couple of faded T-shirts, worn jeans, and a scattering of unopened mail, were hidden away in drawers or closets, as if even they were too personal to be openly displayed. Each room merged into the next with the same oppressive sameness, the same faint scent of stale air and disuse, proof of a life I merely inhabited rather than truly lived.


  The morning commute was a daily assault on my senses. The constant blare of car horns, the choking exhaust fumes from older vehicles, the frantic weaving of traffic, it was a chaotic symphony, a fitting warm-up for the noise and tension awaiting me at the warehouse.


  My workplace, a vast, echoing space filled with the endless clatter of forklifts and the drone of conveyor belts, felt as impersonal and draining as my apartment. Conner, my boss, was already in full swing when I clocked in, a deep red flush creeping up his neck as he waved a stack of delivery manifests in my direction.


  Conner was a man built like a fire hydrant, broad-shouldered and solid, with a permanent frown etched into his face from years of frustration. His voice, a low, rumbling bellow, could cut through the loud hum of the machinery and make even the toughest guys flinch.


  ""Dayton, are you even paying attention?"" he barked, his words slicing through the industrial noise like a sharp knife. ""This isn't rocket science! Pallet number seven, you put it on the wrong truck! Do you even look at what you‚Äôre doing, or do you just wander around like a zombie?""


  I mumbled an apology, my shoulders dropping automatically in a practiced gesture of surrender. It was always something with Conner‚Äî a misplaced item, a form filled out incorrectly, a minute too long on a break. Each small mistake, no matter how trivial, was blown out of proportion under his unforgiving gaze, turned into a serious offence. My previous attempts to explain myself, to quietly defend my actions, had long since faded into silence. It was easier, I had learned, to accept the blows, to let his anger wash over me like a toxic wave. Confrontation made my stomach knot up, leaving me trembling and unable to speak. It‚Äôs a weakness I despise in myself, but one I seem utterly unable to overcome.


  As he continued his rant, his face twisting with what looked like fake anger, little bits of spit flying into the air around him, I heard it. A faint whisper, like dry leaves scraping across hot pavement on a windless day, just at the edge of my hearing.


  It was unsettling, a low murmur that sent a fresh shiver down my spine, colder than any morning breeze. The words were a jumble, an unintelligible heap of words, but the tone was undeniably chilling, carrying a hint of something ancient and slightly malevolent.


  I flinched, my head snapping up, my eyes darting around the cavernous warehouse floor. Was it just the machines, the echoes bouncing off the high ceiling? Was I imagining things? Conner paused, mid-sentence, his face hardened, his eyes narrowed suspiciously. ""What was that, Dayton? You got something to say now? Something smart to add to this mess you made?""


  ""No, sir. Just... sorry,"" I stammered, my voice barely a whisper, my throat suddenly dry. He grunted, a dismissive sound, turning back to the manifests, his attention already shifting to the next potential problem.


  I grabbed the chance, moving past him, a sudden, desperate urge to escape the sound, to find a quiet corner where the phantom whisper couldn't reach me.


  My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat of unexplained fear. It's just stress, I told myself, more like a prayer than a declaration. The pressure of work. That's all it is.


  The rest of the workday passed in a daze of forced focus. Every clang of metal, every distant voice, every hum of machinery seemed to carry the possibility for that chilling whisper to return. I kept my head down, trying to become invisible.


  I ate my lunch alone in the break room, picking at a cold sandwich, acutely aware of the hushed conversations of my colleagues, imagining their hushed judgments, their complaints about my slowness, my perceived incompetence.


  My isolation, usually a strange comfort, now felt like a heavy burden, a vast, empty space into which I might disappear entirely.
By the time I drove my old, sputtering sedan through the busy evening traffic and unlocked the familiar, uninviting door of my apartment, exhaustion had settled deep in my bones, heavier than any physical labor.


  My muscles ached, but it was the dull throb behind my eyes, the persistent buzzing in my ears, and the tightening knot in my stomach that honestly wore me down. The drab living room, usually a comfort in dullness, felt strangely suffocating tonight. A thick, unseen weight seemed to press down on the air, making each breath feel shallow and complex.


  My steps led me, almost without thinking, towards the bathroom for some reason. I pushed the door open cautiously, my hand hovering on the knob as if expecting something to jump out and devour me.


  There was nothing there, and the mirror, thankfully, looked normal. Its chipped edges, which usually irritated me, now felt like it was mocking me. But the memory of that stuttering reflection this morning, plus the ominous whisper at work, clung to me.


  Then all of a sudden, intense fear bloomed in my chest, a cold, spreading dread that made my skin crawl. I couldn't explain it, couldn't put into words the vague eeriness that had taken root, but I knew, with a certainty that chilled me to the core, that I couldn't leave that mirror uncovered tonight, but Icouldn‚Äôt explain why.


  I fumbled through the small linen closet, my fingers brushing against stiff, unused towels, finally pulling out a faded, moth-eaten blanket, a leftover from a previous tenant, forgotten and unwanted, much like myself. With trembling hands, I draped it over the mirror, the thin fabric a flimsy barrier, a poor excuse for a shield.


  I carefully tucked the edges behind the frame, trying to make sure it was covered entirely, hoping its worn weave would truly deter whatever unseen presence I now imagined.
I left the bathroom light on for the first time. It made me feel childish, but it felt like the right thing to do.


  Sleep, when it finally arrived, was a broken jumble of shadows and half-formed fears. The blanketed mirror, even though covered, seemed to loom in my mind, a dark, pulsing portal to unknown terrors.


  In the dream, I found myself standing before it, though the blanket was gone, and the glass shimmered with an eerie light. And there, for the very first time, I saw her.


  She stood behind the shimmering, translucent barrier of the mirror, her silhouette faint but distinct. Her face was etched with a profound despair, lines of sorrow radiating from her eyes, pulling down the corners of her mouth. Her gaze, wide and full of an aching sadness, was fixed on something just beyond my sight, as if pleading with a hidden observer. Her hands, pale and slender, pressed against an unseen wall, yearning for an escape, her fingers spread, as if trying to claw her way through an invisible membrane.


  She looked lost, utterly trapped, a prisoner in a glass cage. I was suddenly filled with a great sense of pity, even in the depths of my uneasy slumber.


  Her silence was more chilling than it would have been if she were screaming or yelling at me, and her stillness more terrifying than any frantic movement. I watched her, transfixed, a bystander to agony.


  The dream felt too real. And I was unaware that I had unconsciously made my first connection to the other side.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The morning sun, still a weak filter through my grimy apartment windows, felt colder than usual. I pulled the blanket from the bathroom mirror, the flimsy fabric offering no comfort now. The glass stared back, blank and still, but the chilling memory of the dream, of the woman‚Äôs trapped face, lingered like a faint scent in the air.


  I splashed water on my face again, hoping to wash away the lingering unease, but it clung stubbornly to my thoughts. The faint hum of the refrigerator seemed louder than usual, a constant, low thrum against the fragile quiet of my apartment.


  Work the next day was a repeat of the last, only amplified. The warehouse air felt thick and heavy, each breath a struggle. Conner was on me again, this time about my bathroom breaks.
""Dayton, are you taking a nap in there? Breaks are for five minutes, not fifty! We‚Äôre not paying you to meditate in the john, Winslow. We got product to move!"" His voice, irritating, scraped at my already frayed nerves. My feelings of inadequacy, a familiar ache that had lived inside me for as long as I could remember, began to swell, threatening to burst.


  Each word from Conner felt like a physical blow, shrinking me further, making me feel smaller and more useless.


  I retreated to the break room, needing a moment away from Conner's relentless gaze. A couple of my coworkers, Mike and Sarah, offered sympathetic glances. Mike, a burly guy with a kind smile, clapped me on the shoulder. ""Don't mind, Conner, Dayton. He's just a grump on Wednesdays. Happens to everyone."" Sarah, quieter, just offered a slight, knowing nod. Their gestures were kind, but they did little to soothe the sting of Conner's words. I forced a weak smile, mumbled a thank you, and went to grab a paper cup for some lukewarm coffee from the machine.


  As I poured the bitter liquid, their voices, normally a background murmur, drifted to me from behind the snack machine, hushed but clear. ""Honestly, he‚Äôs so slow,"" Joanna‚Äôs voice, sharp and thin, cut through the low hum of the vending machine.


  Joanna was Conner's right-hand woman, always hovering, always whispering in his ear. She had a tight, almost permanent smile that never reached her eyes, which were often narrowed, observing everyone with a calculating gaze.


  ""And honestly, the way he skips steps on the packing line‚Ä¶ almost cost us a client last week,"" Mike mumbled something I couldn't quite catch, but Sarah‚Äôs voice was unmistakable. ""Yeah, he‚Äôs got no hustle. Conner's right to be on him. Everyone else pulls their weight.""


  My hand tightened around the flimsy paper cup, nearly crushing it. The coffee sloshed over my fingers, but I barely felt the warmth. Skipping steps? Hustle? They did the same things.


  Mike forgot to double-check pallet numbers all the time. Sarah often came in late after her lunch break. The blatant hypocrisy, the casual betrayal in their voices, burned hotter than any coffee spill. It wasn't just Conner, then. It was them too. All of them. The injustice of it all, the feeling of being judged and talked about behind my back for the very things others got away with, twisted my stomach into a hard, cold knot.


  I couldn't stand it anymore. The stale air of the break room suddenly felt suffocating. I needed to get away, to find a place where I wasn't being watched, where I couldn't hear their whispers. I retreated to the bathroom, the only place I felt I could truly breathe in this entire building.


  The cool tiles offered little comfort against the burning shame in my cheeks. I splashed cold water on my face, again, as if trying to wash away the feeling of being exposed, of being found wanting.


  The stale air in the bathroom pressed in on me, making my skin prickle. The fluorescent lights hummed with a low, constant buzz, highlighting every speck of dust on the grimy floor. I looked into the mirror above the sink. My reflection stared back, my eyes wide, pupils slightly dilated with a fear I couldn‚Äôt quite name.


  And then, a prickle at the back of my neck. That familiar, chilling sensation, as if eyes were boring into me from the other side of the glass. I glanced around the empty bathroom, but there was nothing, no one. Still, the feeling persisted, an intense, unsettling awareness of being watched, an invisible gaze pressing against my back, just from beyond the reflective surface. I hurried through the rest of my break, eager to leave the unsettling stillness behind.


  Back home, after a long, hot shower, the steam filled my small bathroom, fogging the mirror. I reached for my towel, my hand brushing against the misty glass. A distinct handprint was there, perfectly formed against the condensation.


  It was clearly a man's hand, large and with thick fingers, a perfect match for my own. I assumed it was mine, a simple condensation mark from when I'd reached for the soap or the shower knob.


  But as I went to wipe it away with my towel, it wouldn‚Äôt budge. My towel slid over the glass, the handprint stubbornly remaining, as if it were a stain. I pressed harder, then harder still, scrubbing at it, but it was fixed, unmoving, mocking my efforts.


  My breath quickened. A cold dread, far more potent than the unease from the morning, seeped into my bones.


  This was different. This wasn't fatigue. This wasn't stress. This was something else entirely. I pulled my hand away from the mirror, slowly, as if afraid it might bite. As I stepped back, my eyes fixed on the unchanging handprint, a faint mist began to gather on the mirror, blooming from the center outwards. It wasn't just the steam from the shower now. This was fresh condensation, forming rapidly, like someone was breathing directly onto the glass from behind it, a slow, deliberate puff of warm air.


  A wave of intense cold washed over me, despite the residual warmth from the shower. It was the kind of chill that settled deep inside, making my teeth ache. Every hair on my arms stood on end. My mind screamed at me to run, to get away.


  Without thinking, I pivoted on my heel and slammed the bathroom door shut, the sound echoing through the silent apartment like a gunshot. The flimsy wood vibrated under my hand, a poor barrier against the fear that now gnawed at me.


  That night, sleep was a battle I was losing. The memory of the handprint, the strange, breathing mist, and the trapped woman from my dream swirled in my head. I lay in bed, staring at the dimly lit ceiling, listening. The apartment was quiet, quieter than usual.


  Then, from the direction of the bathroom, I heard it. A faint murmur. Not the sharp whisper from work, but a low, indistinct mumbling, like someone talking to themselves just beyond a closed door. Then, a distinct voice, soft but clear, speaking words I couldn't quite make out, but undeniably there, coming from the other side of the mirror. It continued, off and on, a quiet, unsettling presence that turned the silence of my apartment into a living, breathing thing. I pulled the blankets up to my chin, my body rigid, wishing for the dawn.

But until the backpacks get stuffed and the bedtime routines get resumed, there is a final opportunity to allow the kids to cut loose on fun.

That is why the End of Summer Dance Party at [**Altitude Trampoline Park**](https://www.altitudedelmar.com/) with DJ Reckless appears to be the best possible closure of the chapter. It is not only about music, it is about walls of trampolines and the sound of laughter, screens in an arcade night in between dancing moves, and energy that keeps everyone going like kids (and a few bold parents) on Pizza.

# Party Vibes Floating in the Air

You just know the drill if you have ever seen your kids preparing to attend a big event before. The question of what to wear begins weeks before. The calendar is circled--big, bold with hearts drawn around the 22nd of August, 6 to 9 PM only at our [**indoor trampoline park**](https://www.altitudedelmar.com/page.cfm?pageid=62517&articleid=39556). And as the day approaches the entire household is taken by buzz.

Since here is the thing, this is not just a jump session. Three hours full of spins, grooves and moves for the cost of $25 per jumper (members of Funfull pay a mere 10 dollars) along with a piece of pizza and drink to replenish in between jumps and dancing action.

# Why Parents Would Love It?

Cool, the kids will be active non-stop- bouncing off of foam pits, climbing rock walls, competing with friends on the Ninja Warrior Course, but parents understand it is more than just physical activity. Altitude Trampoline Park is that amalgamation of freedom and security.

You may sit back and relax, drink a coffee and watch your kids flying in the air and rest that they are in an area where they could take risks without any harm.

And even should you dance? You would be surprised at yourself, well. Imagine yourself as a parent who promised¬† your own self to just observe and thirty minutes later, playing dodgeball, as well as giggling so much that it's hard to stop.

# Music, Magic, Moments

DJ Reckless will be pounding down the beats- music that the children can sing along to, and possibly some old songs parents sing to themselves. In the midst of it all you are going to get those unplanned little moments in all their glory: your child mid leap with a grin so wide it could split their face, a gaggle of friends attempting to accomplish a **trampoline place** dance move (and failing miserably), siblings supporting each other on the sidelines.

And this is the time that joins summer and school--the time you will recall as you wade up to the knees in homework and brown-bag lunches.



# A Nite Like None Other Only at Altitude Trampoline Park

As the kids play the final song and the trampolines slow down, they will be sweaty, flushed, and exhaustedly happy so they won‚Äôt resist bedtime. And you?

I've got a 2.3L 2006 i-Sport Mazda 6, it's been wonderful to me so far, but it sounds/feels like a coffee pot rattling itself to death during certain scenarios.

  
Following concerning noises, a T-bone crash and a few other things, my Engine's been acting up (little to no power on the low end, inconsistent idle revs, etc.) and I feel it's time to rebuild it or replace it.

  
Over on the forums, I've been reading that the VVT Actuators go bad on these, and you need specific tools to balance the engine if you mess with the balancer bolts? 

  
So I'm just wondering if I should

  
a) Attempt a rebuild of the 2.3L MZR engine that's apparently notoriously weak for anything besides daily driving point a-b, burns oil and nukes VVT on its own ($???)

  
b) Attempt a Ford Fusion/GH swap with the 2.5L NA engine that should just fit right in (roughly 1k)

  
c) Take the loss and swap the car entirely, as in, selling it and buying a less ruined example (roughly 6k where I live for a decent example)

Ako yung nag-post siguro 2 months ago na nainlove sa fubu niya. Marami na nagpost ng ganung context dito pero I was the one na nasa legal profession.

So from post na yun, cinontinue pa rin namin yung setup. Pero last Thursday, he suddenly messaged me na he can‚Äôt continue the setup anymore kasi he wants to focus on his business and some other things. Of course I agreed, because what was I supposed to say? I know he is having problems with his business and I understand.

Then come Sunday, nagsimba ako and prayed for healing, I prayed for his success and genuine happiness. Sana pala hindi na lang hahah charot Than gabi ng Sunday, I was talking with my friend making fun of the fact na my ex fubu and I aren‚Äôt talking anymore. Then‚Ä¶ boom. Here comes the revelation.

Apparently, Sunday afternoon, my exfubu messaged my friend on Telegram(he has since been blocked by my friend).  He confessed that he really likes her‚Ä¶ that he wants to take her out to lunch or dinner‚Ä¶ that they should meet to discuss‚Ä¶ and that he ended it with me already because he wants to be with her‚Ä¶ and that he just doesn‚Äôt have the courage to say it.

Imagine my fucking surprise. I was hurt so bad. Sobrang sakit. I feel so betrayed by his actions. I treated him as a friend. Sobrang nice and accommodating ko sakanya. He has his own house slippers at my condo. I have a stock of pocari sweat sa condo kasi his stomach gets upset sa ‚Äúnormal‚Äù water. Alam ko lahat ng ganap niya sa buhay, all his plans etc. Siguro sobrang disappointing din on my part kasi I‚Äôm not really nice to guys, and siya na pinili kong itreat ng ganito, ginagu ako.

Hindi siya ma-comprehend ng utak ko. So all this? For six months? He wanted her? So when we‚Äôre being intimate, does this mean he wishes it were her? He wishes it were her all this time? Ganun ba yun? So ano pala ako dito? Placeholder until he has the courage to confess to her. Ang sakit sakit lang kasi the words I wanted to hear from him :

‚ÄúI really like you.‚Äù ‚ÄúLets have dinner/lunch.‚Äù ‚ÄúI want to be with you.‚Äù

Hindi ko yan narinig ever sakanya pero bakit skanya ang dali dali niya lang sabihin‚Ä¶ and to make it worse he also told her:

‚ÄúI never saw her more than a fubu honestly.‚Äù ‚ÄúShe is a good girl, but not my type of gf.‚Äù

Hahaha tangina‚Ä¶ alam ko naman. Pero to tell those words to my close friend in order lang siguro to convince her to try being with him, sobra naman. Sobrang humiliated ako. Hiyang hiya na ako sa sarili ko and sa mga kaibigan ko.

I confronted him pero he denied it until the last minute. Inanalyze ko yung messages. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt pero it‚Äôs him‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs him. That‚Äôs the way he texts.. those are the words he uses and that‚Äôs how he types some words.  So nagtext ako sakanya kinabukasan saying hindi na ako maniniwala sa lies niya. And I know siya yun. And grabe grabe na yung disrespect. I told him tinuring ko siyang kaibigan. Pero up until the end, he didn‚Äôt even protect my feelings.

Hindi siya nagreply  then after a few hours, I‚Äôm blocked. Implied admission na rin yun. Kasi knowing how he is, he will defend himself.

What baffles me is the fact na my ex fubu knows na I‚Äôm really close with my friend, and that his friend has a history with my close friend. We introduced them when we started the setup last February. So my friend likes his friend. I mean? How tasteless can he be.

What baffles me more is that he‚Äôs only seen her four times. All those times, they were with me. Two times to pick me up, once sa coffee shop na 4 kami (me, friend, exfubu, exfubu‚Äôs friend whom my friend likes), and once ulit sa coffee shop na kaming 3 lang. They don‚Äôt even text or message each other. The only time he messaged her is when he can‚Äôt contact me so he asked her where was I.

As of this writing, hindi pa rin siya maabsorb ng utak ko. Parang‚Ä¶ when he holds my hand while driving? all the forehead kisses? All the i miss yous? All the territorial and jealousy shit? Every time he kisses me all over my face‚Ä¶ lahat ba yun he wishes sana yung friend ko na lang? I feel so betrayed by him. I know he has issues pero I never thought it would be this bad.

I know you‚Äôll say ‚Äúfubu ka lang, bat ka nag-expect?‚Äù It‚Äôs not even about my feelings being reciprocated kasi tbh I don‚Äôt see him as someone I would marry, pero nakakabastos lang kasi akala ko at some point friends kami since he‚Äôs very close with me.

Gusto ko lang umiyak nang umiyak ngayon. I know sasabihin niyo ‚Äúeh fubu ka lang‚Äù. I know that. But I also thought within those 6 months we developed a friendship that will make him hesitate hurting me like this.",12,1755579439.0,OffMyChestPH,13,0.93,False

Okay wait, so I just opened my Upgrade Plan button and saw that there is a new Paid ChatGPT plan for INR 399 ($5) ?

Till now a ChatGPT Plus subscription costed $20, might not seem a lot but it's almost Rs. 2000 per month . That's actually REALLY expensive for a student, or a bootstrapped founder.

Now there is a new plan called ""Go"" that is Rs. 399/month!!

1. Access to GPT-5
2. Expanded messaging & uploads
3. Faster image generation
4. Longer memory & context
5. Projects, tasks & custom GPTs

So basically the only difference is **SORA & Codex** which you don't get in the Rs. 399 plan.

**Introduction-**Why¬†**Freelancing in Digital Marketing**¬†is a Wise Career Choice in 2025

The need for digital marketing with freelancing is on the rise in 2025. Companies, ranging from local coffee shops to international corporations, require competent marketers to support them online.

Freelancing,¬†**unlike working full-time**, provides:

* **Freedom:**¬†to work from anywhere.
* **Multiple sources of income:**¬†from various clients.
* **Creative autonomy:**¬†over the kind of projects you undertake.
* **Global Opportunities:**¬†Work with clients across the world and earn in different currencies.
* **Low Entry Barriers:**¬†No need for years of experience ‚Äî with the right skills and portfolio, you can start getting projects quickly.

Example: A home-based[¬†**freelance social media**](https://youtube.com/shorts/1s7ZGbHV9Bk?si=T6xhzEddeXii8Qc_)¬†marketer can work on three restaurant accounts simultaneously ‚Äî earning on each as they work from home.  
**1. Learn the Core Skills-**

You must develop skills in the following areas before beginning your freelancing career in digital marketing:

* [**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**](https://schoolofdigitalmarketing.co.in/courses/seo-training-institutes-pune/)

Optimizes websites so that they rank higher in Google. Involves keyword research, on-page optimization (titles, headings, meta tags), and building links.

Example: Positioning a bakery website for ‚Äúbest chocolate cake in Pune.‚Äù  
[**Social Media Marketing**](https://schoolofdigitalmarketing.co.in/courses/social-media-training-institutes-pune/)

Managing and scaling channels such as Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Pinterest. It includes content calendaring, posting, responding to followers, and monitoring analytics.

Example: Growing a salon‚Äôs Instagram followers from 800 to 5,000 in three months.

* **Paid Advertising (Google & Meta Ads)**

Advertising on Google Search, YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram to generate immediate leads and sales. Qualifications include targeting, budgeting, and monitoring ad performance.

Example: Developing a Facebook advertising campaign that generates 100 new leads for a fitness studio within one week.

* **Content Writing & Copywriting**

Developing blog posts, social media post captions, website copy, and ad copy that resonates with people and inspires them to act.

Example: Crafting an Instagram advertisement that convinces 300 individuals to click ‚ÄúBook Now‚Äù for the launch of a new restaurant.

* [**Email Marketing**](https://schoolofdigitalmarketing.co.in/courses/email-marketing-training-institutes-pune/)

Sending automated series, promotional emails, and newsletters to convert the leads into permanent customers.

Example: A welcome email series that converts 20% of new subscriptions into payers.

**Pro Tip**: Master a single skill in-depth first, then build in others to provide full-service packages.

# 2. Select a Lucrative Niche-

Focusing on a niche makes you distinct in the saturated digital marketing space with freelancing.

**Hottest Niches:**

* Social Media Management for restaurants.
* SEO for e-commerce websites.
* Paid Ads for property agencies.
* Content writing for technology startups.

**Pro**¬†**Tip**: Select a niche you already know or have a passion for ‚Äî this will simplify your work and make it more efficient.

# 3. Build a Portfolio Without Clients-

If you‚Äôre new, create examples of your work to show potential clients.

**Ideas for Portfolio Work:**

* Design a mock Instagram strategy for a well-known brand.
* Write SEO-friendly blog posts on trending topics.
* Run a small ad campaign for your social media page.
* Offer free services to 2‚Äì3 small businesses in exchange for testimonials.

**Where to Showcase Your Portfolio:**

* Personal website
* LinkedIn profile
* Google Drive folder with shareable link

# ¬†4. Obtain Your First Clients

Obtaining clients for¬†**digital marketing through freelancing**¬†can be achieved in two methods:

1. **Freelance Platforms:**

* Upwork ‚Äì Ideal for long-term projects.
* Fiverr ‚Äì Suitable for minor, fly-by-night jobs.
* [Freelancer.com](http://Freelancer.com) ‚Äì Provides a range of jobs.

1. **Direct Outreach:**

* Reach out to business owners on LinkedIn.
* Get into Facebook and WhatsApp business groups.
* Go to local networking events.

**Example Pitch:**

Hi Niharika, I noticed that your business has the potential to expand online, but there is limited engagement. I help businesses expand their reach and increase sales. Would you like me to send a quick action plan to you?  
**. Establish Your Pricing-**

At the beginning, have your prices competitive yet reasonable.

**Example Beginner Pricing:**

* Social Media Management: ‚Çπ5,000‚Äì‚Çπ10,000/month
* Blog Writing: ‚Çπ0.50‚Äì‚Çπ1 per word
* Google Ads Setup: ‚Çπ3,000‚Äì‚Çπ5,000 per campaign

**Pro Tip**: Provide package deals ‚Äî i.e., social media management + ad setup at a lower rate within the first 3 months.

¬†

# 6. Continuously Learn and Adapt

Digital marketing changes rapidly, so learning is essential.

**How to Remain Current:**

* YouTube channels such as Neil Patel & Surfside PPC.
* Blogs such as Search Engine Journal & HubSpot.
* Webinars and online workshops in the industry.

**Example**: Google updates its SEO algorithm regularly ‚Äî it pays to know the updates so your clients are ahead.

¬†

# 7. Show Results and Establish Your Reputation

Clients remain when you deliver measurable results.

**Best Practices:**

* Share monthly reports via Google Analytics or ad insights.
* Don‚Äôt hide your successes and challenges.
* Meet every deadline.

Satisfied clients result in referrals,¬†**making your freelancing digital marketing business**¬†grow faster without additional marketing.

# More Benefits of Freelancing in Digital Marketing

* **Work-Life Balance:**¬†You control your workload, but discipline is key.
* **Control Over Earnings:**¬†You decide your rates and can scale quickly.
* **Global Reach:**¬†Freelancers can earn in USD/EUR, often higher than local rates. Example: A $500 project from a U.S. client equals nearly ‚Çπ40,000.
* **Networking Growth:**¬†Good work with one client often leads to multiple referrals.

1mu8x0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mu8x0l/need_help_troubleshooting_inconsistent_shots_with/,Need help troubleshooting inconsistent shots with my [1Zpresso J-Ultra],"**TL;DR:** I upgraded from a KinGrinder P2 to a J-Ultra, expecting night-and-day improvement, but I'm actually getting less consistent shots. Same grind setting can give me 45s one day and 33s the next. I'm also grinding at the very bottom end of 1Zpresso's recommended espresso range, even on a Flair Pro 3, which should require coarser. Workflow is consistent, and my P2 doesn't show these swings. Could my J-Ultra be faulty or am I missing something?

¬†

I could really use some help figuring out what's going on with my J-Ultra. I've been holding off posting, thinking I'd get the hang of it, but three weeks in, my shots are still all over the place.

**My setup:** Flair Pro 3 (46mm basket), 15g in, 40g out, aiming for about 45s.

**My beans:** Same roaster, Peruvian beans from around 1600 meters above sea level, dark espresso roast, started using on day 8 and at around 2 weeks post-roast right now. Stored frozen in batches in vacuum-sealed bags, then moved into an OutPeak vacuum canister.

**My workflow:** I RDT 3 sprays per 15g, grind as vertically as possible, not too rushed, I WDT VERY thoroughly with a flared 0.25mm needle tool, I tamp twice as recommended by Flair (with a twist in between), heat up the brew cylinder over my kettle, pour the water at a consistent 90¬∞C, I do a pressure profile of tiny pre-infusion, then ramp up to 9 bars, then ramp down to 3 bars by the end of the shot.

It's not that any of the shots taste bad. The faster ones are thinner, of course, and with acidity trying to poke its head, but still enjoyable; the rare 40-45s ones are excellent! But here's the thing: I was also getting good-tasting shots with my P2. I can't shake the feeling that I've paid 5x more for a grinder that looks nicer but gives me less predictability.

**Sample data:**

Aside from that 2-day example of 45s last night and 33s tonight at 1.0.0, here's what I've been seeing, summarised in a 1-week sampling snapshot that might be more useful than my explanations:

* *Day 1: 30s at 1.1.2, 59s at 1.0.6*
* *Day 2: 56s at 1.0.6*
* *Day 3: 55s at 1.0.6*
* *Day 4: 40s at 1.0.8*
* *Day 5: 32s at 1.0.7*
* *Day 6: 32s, 58s, 47s at 1.0.7*
* *Day 7: 44s, 52s at 1.0.7*

That kind of swing feels way outside what's normal bean ageing/human variation (if one is being really careful with one's workflow, of course).

With my P2 (33 microns/click), 1 click equals 5-7s difference. With the J-Ultra (8 microns/click), I'd expect far less impact‚Ä¶ but I'm still seeing swings of 10+ seconds with 1 click.

Even stranger: if I'm at, say, 1.0.7 for one shot, and I go to, say, 1.0.9 and immediately back to 1.0.7, the second 1.0.6 shot often runs dramatically faster. Indeed, this is what you can see on both day 6 and 7: first I did it my accident, next day I purposefully tested this out to see if the dramatically different results had anything to do with me changing click setting back and forth. So like opening the distance between the burrs and closing it back again doesn't actually close it to the same degree. (I find there's much less of a difference if you go down in clicks and back up.)

Also, why am I having to grind at the very lowest value of the espresso threshold as recommended by 1Zpresso? On the Flair, with its 46mm basket, I should be grinding coarser than normal; instead, I'm grinding as fine as the manufacturer thinks espresso should go before turning into Turkish coffee... What's up with that?

[EDIT:] Forgot to mention that I'm also getting more channeling issues with the J-Ultra, at least on the faster shots. With my P2 I had got to where I was almost never channeling. But even with a thorough distribution and tamping, on the J-Ultra I will get a tiny spurt or two every 3-4 shots.

*(Btw, to make sure I wasn't imagining that my P2 was giving me more consistent shots, last week I took a break from the J-Ultra and only used the P2, and I corroborated I was getting more consistent shots throughout the week.)*

I really like using the J-Ultra. It offers a smooth grind, comfortable size, great capacity (a blessing vs my P2 when I need to grind for two). But right now, the unpredictability is stressing me out and stopping me from enjoying my daily espresso ritual.

**Has anyone else experienced this kind of inconsistency with the J-Ultra? Does this sound like a quirk I just need to get the hang of, or could something actually be wrong with my grinder? Any advice would be hugely appreciated.**",1,1755578599.0,espresso,11,1.0,False

Hi again ‚Äî I originally posted about the long-standing tension with my mom, her hurtful comments toward my husband, and my struggle with whether to let her visit. Here‚Äôs the latest.


Quick recap for context:

	‚Ä¢	My husband (28M) and I (27F) started dating in 2021, engaged in Dec 2023, married Oct 2024.

	‚Ä¢	My relationship with my mom (61F) has been complicated for years due to her alcoholism, volatility, and lack of accountability.

	‚Ä¢	She was minimally supportive during our wedding planning and made choices that hurt me.

	‚Ä¢	At my twin sister‚Äôs destination wedding this year, my mom made multiple passive-aggressive comments ‚Äî including telling my sister that her wedding was ‚Äúso much better‚Äù than mine. My husband heard it, I didn‚Äôt.

	‚Ä¢	After the trip, my husband and I agreed she would no longer be welcome to stay in our home. Since April, we‚Äôve had very limited contact.



The recent conversation:

I finally called my mom to talk about it. She immediately denied saying anything hurtful and essentially called my husband a liar. We went back and forth, and she eventually agreed to call and apologize to him directly. She asked for his work schedule, I gave it to her, and she said she‚Äôd call.

Then, instead of following through, she texted saying she wanted a three-way call instead ‚Äî reframing the situation as a ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù or ‚Äúrelay of communication.‚Äù I told her clearly this wasn‚Äôt about miscommunication ‚Äî it was about words that were said and how they made us feel. What we needed first was ownership and an apology.

Her reply was that she‚Äôs ‚Äúbeen accused of speaking without thinking‚Äù and now wants to talk with her sister (my aunt) before speaking with us again. She said she‚Äôll let us know when she‚Äôs ready.


The unexpected twist:

The day after my mom said she wanted to talk with my aunt before speaking to us again, my aunt texted me out of the blue:

‚ÄúCall me when you have a minute to talk. No one knows I am reaching out to you so please don‚Äôt mention it.‚Äù

I called her, and we had an incredibly validating conversation. She‚Äôs been through almost the exact same dynamic with their mom and with my mom ‚Äî constant comparisons, disapproval of her spouse, judgment about her life choices. She told me my mom has never taken genuine accountability or given a real apology, and likely never will. She encouraged me to stop chasing approval, keep my focus on my marriage, and keep any interactions with my mom surface-level and drama-free.

Later in the call, I told her that my mom had said she wanted to speak with her before reaching out to us again. The very next morning, my aunt texted me:

‚ÄúYour mom talked to me when we were having coffee this morning. I will call you later today to let you know what we discussed. I didn‚Äôt tell her that you and I talked yesterday nor did I start the conversation ‚Äî she did.‚Äù

When she called later, she gave my husband the lowdown on what we‚Äôd discussed the day before and shared what my mom had said. At one point, my mom apparently asked my aunt if she should apologize to us ‚Äî and my aunt told her no, because she believed it wouldn‚Äôt be genuine anyway.



Where Things Stand Now:

Despite my aunt‚Äôs advice, my mom still texted both my husband and me in a group chat asking when my husband had time this week to talk‚Äîafter putting us off with excuses multiple times. At that point, my husband (28M) was fully done. He doesn‚Äôt want to keep going in circles, and I don‚Äôt blame him.

For me, it‚Äôs sad to accept that my mom may never be the type to take real accountability or give a genuine apology. I know it‚Äôs going to take me some time to heal and move forward, but I also know that low contact (at least for now) is best for my mental health and for my marriage.

I‚Äôll be focusing on my life with my husband, keeping boundaries in place, and leaning on my aunt and of course my husband for support when I need it. If anything changes, I‚Äôll update again.

Thanks to everyone who encouraged me through this‚Äîit‚Äôs been hard, but I finally feel like I‚Äôm putting us first.",79,1755578421.0,TwoHotTakes,8,0.99,False
1mu8ukc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1mu8ukc/kyle_maclachlan_the_multiversal_archetype_of/,Kyle MacLachlan: The Multiversal Archetype of Eccentric Authority,"Alright, buckle up. I think I‚Äôve spotted a pattern and it‚Äôs delightfully bizarre. Kyle MacLachlan keeps showing up as these elegant, slightly unhinged authority figures, and it seems like Bethesda (and now Amazon‚Äôs Fallout series) is quietly running with that archetype across universes.

Twin Peaks: Dale Cooper the origin point, if you will. Charming FBI agent, obsessive about coffee and pie, always calm on the surface but operating on a deeper, surreal logic. The template is set: quirky, meticulous, slightly uncanny, and unforgettable.

How I Met Your Mother: The Captain  wealthy, obsessive with boats, a little unsettling, yet undeniably charismatic.

Starfield: Walter Stroud space magnate, eccentric, very ‚ÄúThe Captain, but in a spacesuit.‚Äù

Fallout (Amazon series): Hank MacLean Overseer of Vault 33, the same combination of authority, charm, and slight suspicion that makes you think, ‚ÄúDo I trust this guy‚Ä¶ or am I about to be experimented on?‚Äù


It‚Äôs almost like Kyle MacLachlan is a living template for a certain type of character: the charmingly weird authority figure. Bethesda has always recycled archetypes between Elder Scrolls and Fallout, but now it feels like Kyle himself is canonically their multiverse NPC, drifting elegantly between worlds.

So yes‚Ä¶ my fan theory: The Captain ‚Üí Walter Stroud ‚Üí Hank MacLean is one continuous archetype thread. He is, in essence, the same multiversal character slightly unhinged, impeccably dressed, always in charge, and probably has a secret obsession we haven‚Äôt discovered yet.

And if nothing else, it gives us a fun reason to nod every time Kyle shows up and say: ‚ÄúAh yes‚Ä¶ the multiverse is watching.‚Äù

And somewhere in every universe, Kyle MacLachlan is quietly judging your life choices.

I did some more job applications and hoped for the best. It's so depressing not getting called back or going to interviews and not hearing back. This is the main reason I been cutting so much.

 I feel so worthless and hopeless every day that passes and I don't receive a job offer I cut. At least when I cut Im able to dissociate and control the pain. It's so relieving and my mind again gets hope. The stings and tingling are a big part of it. I wanted to cut a little more today but I couldn't. I have no room left. I'm covered in cuts. I also have open wounds from previous days. Not to deep but plenty. I wish I could cut my harms. I remember doing it twice there and it felt even better. I just don't do it in my arms because for obvious reasons.



Idk were im gonna cut tomorrow I'll have to control myself. But if I don't do it I feel so bad and suicidal thoghts begin to arise. Tomorrow im gonna do my best to not be alone behind close doors. Like in the day I can go to the park, drink coffee. At night though, idk what im gonna do that's usually when I cut myself.

 Before this spiral I cut myself once and then the next week or the following week. It gave time for my wounds to heal. It was not everyday like it's now :/. But I have never really stopped I just been on and off. My biggest streak was only 6 months. 

I been feeling so bad lately that I don't see any motivation to stop. I'm not hurting anyone, I keep it private to not trigger anyone. I'm actually helping everyone around me by not bothering them. And helping myself if it was not for this idk where I would be. 

But if I say this to anyone they'll just feel pitty for me and think im so weird. Well I'm not gonna worry about tomorrow yet. At least I was able tu cut today and numb myself a bit. I'm just staring at my cuts. I like gently running my fingers through them and feel them. Idk how long im gonna stay in this corner maybe I'll sleep here idk depends. It feels so cozy like if the two walls are hugging me, pathetic I know im so lonely this is the closest I get get to a hug.

I'm okay now, Im sorry it has to be like this. I really wish I could be like other people that don't do this. Sorry for posting frequently this is the only place other than my journal that I can vent.I'm a freak somethig is wrong with me but no one needs to know as long as I smile and nod.

I haven't had a chance to tell K how I feel towards her. She's been too busy to have time to hangout (figures, we only hangout once a month). Plus I've only gotten mixed reponses of ""you should tell her"" vs ""you should NOT tell her how you feel""

I really have no idea what to do. K i've known for over a year and she gets me like no one has before. Yet M has more in common with me but there's just something missing, maybe because I only met her once so far. This isn't to say I know a relationship would even grow with M. BUT if it did, I genuinely wouldn't know what to do. Before, I thought getting in a relationship would help me forget about K, but it doesn't feel like that? At least not right now?

I think the fucked part is the fact I've introduced K to family and friends already and vice versa (before I grew feelings).

TL;DR: I'm going on dates with someone but still have feelings towards a friend",1,1755578307.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

WHY?,"I recently picked up Silver Oak from Blue Tokai and tried it on my V60 pour over. I went with 1:16 and 1:17 ratios, and both times it turned out bitter.

* Water temp: \~85‚Äì90¬∞C for medium roast
* Brew method: V60, 4 pours of \~60 ml each at 30‚Äì45 sec intervals

This isn‚Äôt the first time either. I‚Äôve noticed a pattern: whenever I use medium or darker roasts on pour over, I almost always end up with a bitter cup. Light roasts usually come out clean, bright, and balanced, but anything medium and above = disproportionate bitterness. 

For context, my scale of comparison is Aeropress. With the same beans I get a cup that‚Äôs smoother with only slight bitterness. 

Am I doing something wrong with grind size, water temp, or technique? Or is it just the nature of medium+ roasts with pour overs that they lean bitter?

1mu8rae,https://i.redd.it/axgsmtwxmwjf1.jpeg,REPOST: help,"

I was Aliana Donovan, a resident physician, finally reunited with the wealthy family I'd been lost from as a child. I had loving parents and a handsome, successful fianc√©. I was safe. I was loved. It was a perfect, fragile lie.

The lie shattered on a Tuesday when I discovered my fianc√©, Ivan, wasn't at a board meeting but at a sprawling mansion with Kiera Reese, the woman I was told had a mental breakdown five years ago after trying to frame me.

She wasn't disgraced; she was radiant, holding a little boy, Leo, who giggled in Ivan's arms. 

I overheard their conversation: Leo was their son, and I was merely a ""placeholder,"" a means to an end until Ivan no longer needed my family's connections. My parents, the Donovans, were in on it, funding Kiera's lavish life and their secret family.

My entire reality-the loving parents, the devoted fianc√©, the security I thought I'd found-was a carefully constructed stage, and I was the fool playing the lead role. The casual lie Ivan texted me, ""Just got out of the meeting. So ex**usting. I miss you. See you at home,"" while he stood beside his real family, was the final blow.

They thought I was pathetic. They thought I was a fool. They were about to find out just how wrong they were.


Chapter 1
Five years. That's how long they told me Kiera Reese had been gone. Five years since she'd had a supposed mental breakdown after trying to frame me for leaking corporate secrets, a move that nearly destroyed my medical career. My fianc√©, Ivan Hughes, and my parents, the Donovans, had assured me she was sent away to get help, disgraced and removed from our lives forever.

I believed them. I was Aliana Donovan, a resident physician, finally reunited with the wealthy family I'd been lost from as a child. I had loving parents and a handsome, successful fianc√©. I was safe. I was loved. It was a perfect, fragile lie.

The lie shattered on a Tuesday.

Ivan was supposed to be at a board meeting. He had texted me, ""Thinking of you. It's going to be a long night. Don't wait up."" 

But I wanted to surprise him. I had just finished a grueling 36-hour shift at the hospital and drove to his office building, Hughes Biomedical, with his favorite takeout. The security guard in the lobby gave me a polite smile. ""Mr. Hughes left about an hour ago, Dr. Donovan."" 

A cold knot formed in my stomach. I called his phone. It rang once, then went to voicemail. I tried the tracker on his car, a feature I'd only ever used once when he'd misplaced it in a massive parking garage. The glowing dot on my phone screen wasn't anywhere near his usual routes. It was heading toward a gated community on the other side of town, a place I'd never even heard of.

I drove, my hands tight on the steering wheel. The cold knot in my stomach grew, tightening with every mile. The address led me to a sprawling modern mansion, lights blazing, music spilling out into the manicured gardens. It looked like a party.

I parked down the street and walked toward the house. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I saw a scene that didn't make sense. And then, I saw him. My fianc√©, Ivan. He wasn't in a suit. He was in casual clothes, a relaxed smile on his face.

He was holding a little boy on his shoulders, maybe four or five years old. The boy was giggling, his small hands tangled in Ivan's dark hair.

And then I saw the woman standing next to them, her hand resting on Ivan's arm.

Kiera Reese.

She wasn't disgraced. She wasn't in a treatment facility. She was radiant, dressed in a silk gown, looking every bit the happy mother and partner. She laughed, a sound I remembered with a shudder, and leaned in to k**s Ivan on the cheek. He turned his head and ki**ed her back, a familiar, loving gesture that he had used with me just that morning.

My breath hitched. The world tilted on its axis. I stumbled back into the shadows of a large oak tree, my body trembling.

I could hear their voices through the slightly open patio door.

""Leo is getting so big,"" Kiera said, her voice dripping with contentment. ""He looks more like you every day."" 

""He has his mother's charm,"" Ivan replied, his voice warm with an affection I now realized I had never truly received. He lifted the boy, Leo, off his shoulders and set him down.

""Are you sure Aliana doesn't suspect anything?"" Kiera asked, her tone shifting slightly. ""Five years is a long time to keep this up."" 

""She doesn't have a clue,"" Ivan said, his voice laced with a casual cruelty that stole the air from my lungs. ""She's so grateful to have a family, she'd believe anything we tell her. It's almost sad."" 

""Poor, pathetic Aliana,"" Kiera sneered. ""Still thinks you're going to marry her. Still thinks Mommy and Daddy Donovan love their real daughter more than me."" 

Ivan laughed. It wasn't a nice sound. ""They feel guilty. That's all. They know they owe you. We all do. This house, this life... it's the least we could do to make up for what you  'went through'."" 

He said ""went through"" with air quotes. The whole story of her breakdown was a performance. A lie they all participated in.

I felt a wave of nausea. My parents. They were in on it, too. The money for this lavish life, this secret family, it came from them. From the Donovan fortune that was supposed to be mine.

My entire reality-the loving parents, the devoted fianc√©, the security I thought I'd finally found after a childhood in foster care-was a carefully constructed stage. And I was the fool playing the lead role, unaware that the rest of the cast was laughing at me behind the curtain.

I backed away slowly, my movements wooden. I got into my car, my body shaking so hard I could barely turn the key in the ignition. My phone buzzed in my lap. It was a text from Ivan.

 ""Just got out of the meeting. So exhausting. I miss you. See you at home."" 

The casual lie, typed out while he stood beside his real family, was the final blow. The world didn't just tilt; it crumbled into dust around me.

I drove away, not toward our shared apartment, but toward a future they couldn't control. The grief was a physical weight, crushing my ch**t. But beneath it, a tiny, hard ember of resolve began to glow.

They thought I was pathetic. They thought I was a fool.

They were about to find out just how wrong they were.


Chapter 2
The next morning, I walked into the apartment I shared with Ivan. He was in the kitchen, making coffee, looking handsome and completely untroubled.

""You're home early,"" he said, smiling as he turned to k**s me. I flinched, turning my head so his lips landed on my cheek.

""Tired,"" I mumbled, using the excuse I knew he'd expect after a long shift. ""The drive back was rough."" 

""Poor baby,"" he said, wrapping his arms around me. His embrace felt like a cage. Every word, every touch was a lie. ""My meeting ran so late. We should do something to celebrate the deal closing. And... it's been five years."" 

I looked at him, my expression carefully blank. ""Five years since what?"" 

""Since Kiera... left,"" he said, his eyes full of fake sympathy. ""I know it was hard on you, what she did. I thought maybe we, and your parents, could have a quiet dinner. To mark the occasion. To celebrate how far we've come."" 

The audacity was breathtaking. They wanted to celebrate the anniversary of the lie they'd built around me. I felt a cold, sharp anger slice through the pain.

""That's... a thoughtful idea, Ivan,"" I said, my voice steady. ""Let's do that."" 

His face lit up with relief. ""Great. I'll let your parents know. They'll be so happy you're in a good place about it."" 

He was so sure of me, so confident in his deception. He left for work, whistling, leaving me alone in the sterile, beautiful apartment that now felt like a prison. The moment the door closed, I went straight to his office.

It was always locked. He'd told me it was because of sensitive work documents. I used to respect that. Now, I knew it was a vault for his secrets. But I was a doctor. I knew about pressure points, about finding weaknesses. And I knew Ivan. His password wasn't complex; it was arrogant. It was the date he proposed to me.

I typed it in. The lock clicked open.

The room was pristine, dominated by a large mahogany desk. I started there. In a locked drawer, I found a small, leather-bound photo album. My hands trembled as I opened it.

It wasn't filled with pictures of us. It was picture after picture of Ivan, Kiera, and their son, Leo. At the park, on a beach, celebrating birthdays with cakes and candles. A perfect, happy family. In one photo, my parents were there, too. My mother was holding Leo, beaming, while my father stood with his arm around Kiera. They looked happier in that stolen moment than I had ever seen them with me.

The evidence was damning, but I needed more. I turned to his laptop. The password was the same. His files were meticulously organized. I found a folder labeled ""Personal."" Inside, another folder: ""L."" 

It was everything. Videos of Leo's first steps. His first words. Scans of his birth certificate, listing Ivan as the father. And a subfolder named ""Finances."" 

I clicked it open and my bl**d ran cold. There were monthly wire transfers from a joint account belonging to my parents, Richard and Eleanor Donovan, to a shell corporation. The amounts were staggering. Millions of dollars over five years. The memo line on each one was the same: ""K.R. Living Expenses."" 

They hadn't just enabled this; they had funded it. Every kind word they'd ever said to me, every expensive gift, every hollow promise of family, was paid for with the same money they used to prop up the woman who tried to ruin me and the secret family my fianc√© was raising with her.

The illusion of their love wasn't just a lie; it was a transaction. I was the price they paid to soothe their guilt over Kiera.

I copied everything onto a small, encrypted flash drive. Every photo, every video, every bank statement. As the files transferred, my phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number.

""Having fun playing detective? You'll never find anything. They love me, Aliana. They always have. You were just a convenient replacement."" 

It was Kiera. She must have had a hidden camera in the office. The thought made my skin crawl.

She sent a picture. It was of the family photo I had just seen, the one with my parents.

""We look good together, don't we? Like a real family."" 

Another message followed. ""Ivan is only with you out of pity. And your parents? They're just paying their dues. You'll always be the outsider, the girl from the foster home who doesn't belong."" 

The taunts were meant to break me. And they did, for a moment. I leaned against the desk, the flash drive clutched in my hand, and a single, hot tear of rage and grief rolled down my cheek.

But then, the grief hardened into something else. Something cold and clear.

She was wrong. I wasn't going to break. I was going to burn their whole world to the ground.


Chapter 3
Kiera's message was a declaration of war. She thought she was untouchable, hidden away in her gilded cage. She didn't know I had the key.

I needed to get inside that house one more time, not just for evidence, but to see the truth with my own eyes, to hear it from their own mouths, unfiltered. The flash drive had the what, but I needed the why.

Bribing a servant was the obvious choice. I reviewed the financial records I'd copied. Kiera's household staff was paid through the shell corporation, but one name stood out-a cleaning service that was paid a surprisingly low, flat monthly fee. A company that likely underpaid its workers. I found their website and the name of the manager. A few thousand dollars, transferred from a burner account, was all it took to get me a uniform and a spot on the next day's cleaning crew for the mansion.

The next afternoon, I pulled up to the service entrance in a nondescript van with three other women. I wore a plain blue uniform, a baseball cap pulled low, and a disposable face mask. I kept my head down and my mouth shut.

The housekeeper, a tired-looking woman named Maria, let us in. She barely glanced at me. ""Upstairs bedrooms and the master suite. Be quick. Mrs. Reese doesn't like to be disturbed."" 

I was assigned to the master suite. The room was enormous, with a stunning view of the city. But I wasn't interested in the view. I was interested in the life they had built here. On the bedside table was a silver frame. It held a picture of Ivan and Kiera on their wedding day. They weren't officially married, of course-Ivan was engaged to me. This was a lie within a lie, a ceremony just for them, a fantasy they lived out in secret.

I moved through the house, cleaning mechanically, my eyes scanning everything. The walls were covered in family portraits. Leo on a pony. Kiera and Ivan laughing on a boat. My father, Richard Donovan, a renowned architect, had designed this house. My mother, Eleanor Donovan, a high-society philanthropist, had decorated it. Her signature taste was everywhere.

I found Maria in the kitchen, wiping down the counters. I kept my voice low and disguised. ""It's a beautiful home. They seem like a very happy family."" 

Maria sighed, not looking at me. ""They are. Mr. Hughes adores that boy. And Mr. Donovan... he's here more than he's at his own home. Taught little Leo how to draw. Says the boy has his talent."" 

The words were a physical blow. My father had never offered to teach me anything. I had begged him to teach me calligraphy, his passion, but he always said he was too busy. He wasn't too busy for Leo.

""And Mrs. Donovan?"" I asked, my voice tight.

""Oh, she spoils Kiera rotten,"" Maria said, shaking her head. ""Brings her new jewelry every week. Says Kiera is the daughter she always wanted, so spirited and strong."" 

The daughter she always wanted. Not me. Not the real daughter who had spent years dreaming of a mother's love.

My stomach churned. I had to get out of there. As I turned to leave the kitchen, I heard the sound of a car in the driveway. A sleek black sedan. Ivan's car.

""They're home early!"" Maria hissed, her eyes wide with panic. ""Quick, hide! In the pantry! They can't see you here after hours."" 

She shoved me into the dark, narrow pantry just as the back door opened. I pressed myself against the shelves, my heart pounding against my ribs. Through the slatted door, I could see them. Ivan, Kiera, and Leo.

Leo was crying. ""But I wanted the blue one!"" 

""I know, sweetie, I know,"" Kiera cooed, st**king his hair. ""Daddy will get you the blue one tomorrow, won't you, Daddy?"" 

""Of course,"" Ivan said. He knelt down and looked at Kiera, his face etched with concern. ""Are you okay, though? You looked pale at the store."" 

""I'm fine,"" Kiera said, but her voice was weary. ""Just tired. It's hard, Ivan. Pretending all the time. Waiting for you to finally get rid of her."" 

My breath caught in my throat.

Ivan stood up and pulled Kiera into his arms. He ki**ed her forehead. ""I know, my love. I know it's not fair to you. But we have to be careful. Just a little longer. Once the new merger is complete, I won't need her family's connections anymore. I'll end it. I promise. Then we can be a real family, out in the open."" 

""You promise?"" she whispered.

""I promise,"" he said, his voice a low, in**mate vow. ""You and Leo are my entire world. Aliana... she's just a means to an end. A placeholder."" 

A placeholder.

The word echoed in the silent pantry. That's all I was. A tool he was using. A temporary fix until he got what he wanted. The love, the engagement, our entire life together-it was a business transaction.

I squeezed my eyes shut, fighting the bile that rose in my throat. I had all the proof I needed. I had the photos, the bank statements, and now, the raw, undeniable truth from his own lips.

I waited until they moved into the living room, their laughter echoing down the hall. I slipped out of the pantry, nodded a silent thank you to a terrified-looking Maria, and walked out the service door without a backward glance.

As I was rounding the corner of the house, heading for the street, Kiera stepped out onto the patio for a phone call. She saw me. Her eyes narrowed, a flicker of recognition in them even with my disguise. She didn't know who I was, but she knew I didn't belong.

""Hey, you!"" she called out. ""What are you still doing here?"" 

I didn't answer. I just picked up my pace, my heart hammering. I couldn't let her see my face. Not yet. The game wasn't over. It had just begun.


Chapter 4
Kiera's suspicion was a dangerous spark. I couldn't risk another close call. The next morning, Maria called me on my burner phone, her voice trembling.

""Mrs. Reese was asking about the new girl. She said you looked familiar. I told her you were my cousin, just filling in for the day. I think she believed me, but she's watching everyone now."" 

""You did well, Maria,"" I said, my voice calm. ""Here's what you do now. Quit. I've deposited a year's salary into your account. Disappear for a while."" 

There was a choked sob on the other end of the line. ""Thank you. God bless you."" 

The line went dead. One loose end tied up. Now for the rest.

I called my best friend, Debi Frost. She wasn't just my friend; she was a shark of a lawyer, the sharpest mind I knew. We met at a noisy downtown coffee shop, a place where no one would notice us.

I laid it all out. The secret house, the child, the five-year lie. I slid the flash drive across the table. Her face, usually so animated, became a mask of cold fury as she listened.

""Those ba**ards,"" she breathed, her knuckles white as she gripped her coffee cup. ""All of them. Your parents, too. Aliana, we are going to destroy them."" 

""I don't want to destroy them, Debi,"" I said quietly. ""I just want to disappear. I want to leave them behind with the truth of what they've done."" 

""Leave? Aliana, you're entitled to half of Ivan's assets, not to mention a massive settlement from your parents for the emotional distress..."" 

""I don't want their money,"" I said, the words tasting like ash. ""Their money is what they used to buy my silence, my compliance. It's tainted. I want nothing from them."" 

Debi studied my face, then nodded slowly. ""Okay. If that's what you want. A clean break. We can do that. We'll prepare the divorce papers, cite infidelity. And a document renouncing any claim to the Donovan family inheritance. We'll make it airtight."" 

As we were planning, my phone buzzed. It was an email from my mother's assistant about the ""anniversary"" dinner Ivan had proposed. The location was set: a private room at The Oak Room, the same restaurant where Ivan and I had our first date. The irony was so thick it was suffocating.

But it was a detail at the bottom of the email that made my bl**d run cold. Debi saw my expression and leaned closer. ""What is it?"" 

I read it aloud, my voice barely a wh**per. ""Please confirm Dr. Donovan's dietary restrictions. The chef notes her mild allergy to benzodiazepines from her hospital records."" 

Debi's eyes widened in horror. ""Benzos? They're going to d**g you?"" 

It clicked into place. The dinner wasn't a celebration. It was a trap. They were afraid that on the anniversary of their great deception, I might finally get emotional, or suspicious. They were going to sedate me, just to make sure their evening went smoothly, to ensure the placeholder didn't cause a scene.

The last flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, there was some twisted, misguided love behind their actions died. This was pure, calculated cruelty.

I started to laugh. It was a hollow, broken sound that had nothing to do with humor. ""Of course,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Of course, they would."" 

Debi reached across the table and grabbed my hand. Her grip was firm, grounding. ""Aliana, you can't go."" 

""Oh, I'm going,"" I said, my eyes hard. ""I'm going to let them think their plan is working perfectly. And then, I'm going to vanish."" 

That afternoon, in Debi's office, I signed the papers. The divorce petition. The legal renunciation of the Donovan name and fortune. With each st**ke of the pen, I felt a chain breaking. I was cutting myself free.

I went online and booked a one-way ticket to a small, coastal town in Oregon under a new name, a name I hadn't used since I was a child in the system, before they found me. A name that was truly mine. The flight was for Saturday night, the night of Leo's fifth birthday party. The party I wasn't invited to. The party that would serve as my grand finale.

When I got back to the apartment, Ivan was there, humming as he packed an overnight bag.

""Just a quick business trip,"" he said, not meeting my eyes. ""Have to fly out tonight, back tomorrow afternoon. Just in time for our dinner."" 

I knew where he was going. He was going to Kiera's. To his son's birthday eve.

""Be safe,"" I said, my voice soft.

He ki**ed me, a quick, dismissive peck on the cheek. ""I love you,"" he said.

""I know,"" I replied, the words a hollow echo.

That night, I lay alone in our bed, the sheets cold beside me. For the first time in five years, the loneliness didn't hurt. It felt like freedom. I was no longer Aliana Donovan, the long-lost daughter, the happy fianc√©e. I was a ghost in my own life, counting down the hours until I could finally disappear.


Chapter 5
The night of the dinner arrived. The night of my departure. My mother, Eleanor, fussed over my dress, her smile painted on.

""You look beautiful, darling. So elegant."" 

My father, Richard, stood by, looking proud. ""Ready for our special night?"" 

They were actors giving the performance of their lives. I was the audience of one, and I knew the whole script.

We sat in the private room at The Oak Room. The air was thick with unspoken words. My mother placed a small bowl of soup in front of me. ""The chef made his specialty just for you. A creamy mushroom bisque."" 

I could smell it. The faint, almost undetectable almond scent of the benzodiazepine mixed in. They didn't even try to be creative. They were arrogant.

""Thank you, Mother,"" I said, picking up my spoon. I looked at her, then at my father. ""It means so much that you're all here. That we can finally put the past behind us."" 

Their faces softened with relief. I was playing my part perfectly. I took a spoonful of the soup. Then another. I ate half the bowl, my stomach clenching with each swallow, not from the d**g, but from the betrayal.

After a few minutes, I pressed a hand to my forehead. ""I'm feeling a little... dizzy. I think the shift at the hospital finally caught up with me."" 

""Oh, you poor thing,"" Eleanor said, her concern a masterpiece of fiction. ""Of course. You should rest."" 

""Would you mind if I just... went to the powder room for a moment?"" I asked, my voice intentionally weak.

""Go, go,"" Richard urged. ""We'll be right here."" 

I gave them one last look. My parents. The people who were supposed to love me unconditionally.

""Were you ever sorry?"" I asked, the question slipping out before I could stop it. ""For what happened to me? For all the years I was gone?"" 

They stared at me, their smiles faltering. There was a flicker of something in their eyes-guilt, maybe-but it was quickly extinguished.

""Of course, we were, Aliana,"" my father said, his voice a little too firm. ""Every single day."" 

A lie. Another one. I didn't press. I just nodded. ""I'm glad."" 

I walked toward the back of the restaurant, my steps steady. Once inside the empty, opulent bathroom, I locked the door, knelt before the toilet, and forced myself to throw up, my body convulsing until the soup and the poison were gone. I rinsed my mouth, my face pale but my eyes clear in the mirror.

The dizziness was an act, but the nausea was real.

When I returned to the apartment I had once shared with Ivan, he was waiting. He was dressed for the party, Kiera's party, his face glowing with anticipation. He held out a glass of champagne.

""A toast,"" he said, smiling. ""To us. To our future."" 

I saw the fine powder lingering at the bottom of my glass. A second dose. They were making sure.

I played the part of the smitten fianc√©e one last time. ""To us,"" I echoed, my voice light and airy. I let him think I was dizzy from the dinner, leaning on him slightly.

""I have to go to the hospital for a bit,"" he said, the lie rolling off his tongue with practiced ease. ""An emergency consult. I'll be back as late as I can."" 

""Don't worry about me,"" I said. I took the glass of champagne and, looking him directly in the eye, drank it all down in one go. His smile widened. He thought he had won.

""I'll see you later,"" he said, giving me a quick k**s. He walked out the door without a second glance. He never looked back.

The moment he was gone, I ran to the bathroom and purged the champagne, my body shaking with the effort. When I was done, I felt strangely calm. Cleansed.

I changed into simple, dark clothing. I walked into the living room, where a single, elegantly wrapped gift box sat on the coffee table. I had prepared it that afternoon.

I called the butler from the Donovan estate, a man who had shown me small kindnesses over the years. ""James,"" I said. ""I have a package that needs to be delivered to the party at 10 p.m. precisely. Not before, not after. Can you do that for me?"" 

""Of course, Dr. Donovan,"" he said, his voice steady.

Inside the box was the flash drive, a small portable speaker, and a single, handwritten card.

My final stop was a quiet street overlooking the secret mansion. The party was in full swing. I could see them all through the windows-Ivan, Kiera, Leo, my parents-laughing, celebrating a life built on my pain. They looked so happy.

I was Aliana Donovan, a resident physician, finally reunited with the wealthy family I'd been lost from as a child. I had loving parents and a handsome, successful fianc√©. I was safe. I was loved. It was a perfect, fragile lie.

The lie shattered on a Tuesday when I discovered my fianc√©, Ivan, wasn't at a board meeting but at a sprawling mansion with Kiera Reese, the woman I was told had a mental breakdown five years ago after trying to frame me.

She wasn't disgraced; she was radiant, holding a little boy, Leo, who giggled in Ivan's arms. 

I overheard their conversation: Leo was their son, and I was merely a ""placeholder,"" a means to an end until Ivan no longer needed my family's connections. My parents, the Donovans, were in on it, funding Kiera's lavish life and their secret family.

My entire reality-the loving parents, the devoted fianc√©, the security I thought I'd found-was a carefully constructed stage, and I was the fool playing the lead role. The casual lie Ivan texted me, ""Just got out of the meeting. So ex**usting. I miss you. See you at home,"" while he stood beside his real family, was the final blow.

They thought I was pathetic. They thought I was a fool. They were about to find out just how wrong they were.


Chapter 1
Five years. That's how long they told me Kiera Reese had been gone. Five years since she'd had a supposed mental breakdown after trying to frame me for leaking corporate secrets, a move that nearly destroyed my medical career. My fianc√©, Ivan Hughes, and my parents, the Donovans, had assured me she was sent away to get help, disgraced and removed from our lives forever.

I believed them. I was Aliana Donovan, a resident physician, finally reunited with the wealthy family I'd been lost from as a child. I had loving parents and a handsome, successful fianc√©. I was safe. I was loved. It was a perfect, fragile lie.

The lie shattered on a Tuesday.

Ivan was supposed to be at a board meeting. He had texted me, ""Thinking of you. It's going to be a long night. Don't wait up."" 

But I wanted to surprise him. I had just finished a grueling 36-hour shift at the hospital and drove to his office building, Hughes Biomedical, with his favorite takeout. The security guard in the lobby gave me a polite smile. ""Mr. Hughes left about an hour ago, Dr. Donovan."" 

A cold knot formed in my stomach. I called his phone. It rang once, then went to voicemail. I tried the tracker on his car, a feature I'd only ever used once when he'd misplaced it in a massive parking garage. The glowing dot on my phone screen wasn't anywhere near his usual routes. It was heading toward a gated community on the other side of town, a place I'd never even heard of.

I drove, my hands tight on the steering wheel. The cold knot in my stomach grew, tightening with every mile. The address led me to a sprawling modern mansion, lights blazing, music spilling out into the manicured gardens. It looked like a party.

I parked down the street and walked toward the house. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I saw a scene that didn't make sense. And then, I saw him. My fianc√©, Ivan. He wasn't in a suit. He was in casual clothes, a relaxed smile on his face.

He was holding a little boy on his shoulders, maybe four or five years old. The boy was giggling, his small hands tangled in Ivan's dark hair.

And then I saw the woman standing next to them, her hand resting on Ivan's arm.

Kiera Reese.

She wasn't disgraced. She wasn't in a treatment facility. She was radiant, dressed in a silk gown, looking every bit the happy mother and partner. She laughed, a sound I remembered with a shudder, and leaned in to k**s Ivan on the cheek. He turned his head and ki**ed her back, a familiar, loving gesture that he had used with me just that morning.

My breath hitched. The world tilted on its axis. I stumbled back into the shadows of a large oak tree, my body trembling.

I could hear their voices through the slightly open patio door.

""Leo is getting so big,"" Kiera said, her voice dripping with contentment. ""He looks more like you every day."" 

""He has his mother's charm,"" Ivan replied, his voice warm with an affection I now realized I had never truly received. He lifted the boy, Leo, off his shoulders and set him down.

""Are you sure Aliana doesn't suspect anything?"" Kiera asked, her tone shifting slightly. ""Five years is a long time to keep this up."" 

""She doesn't have a clue,"" Ivan said, his voice laced with a casual cruelty that stole the air from my lungs. ""She's so grateful to have a family, she'd believe anything we tell her. It's almost sad."" 

""Poor, pathetic Aliana,"" Kiera sneered. ""Still thinks you're going to marry her. Still thinks Mommy and Daddy Donovan love their real daughter more than me."" 

Ivan laughed. It wasn't a nice sound. ""They feel guilty. That's all. They know they owe you. We all do. This house, this life... it's the least we could do to make up for what you  'went through'."" 

He said ""went through"" with air quotes. The whole story of her breakdown was a performance. A lie they all participated in.

I felt a wave of nausea. My parents. They were in on it, too. The money for this lavish life, this secret family, it came from them. From the Donovan fortune that was supposed to be mine.

My entire reality-the loving parents, the devoted fianc√©, the security I thought I'd finally found after a childhood in foster care-was a carefully constructed stage. And I was the fool playing the lead role, unaware that the rest of the cast was laughing at me behind the curtain.

I backed away slowly, my movements wooden. I got into my car, my body shaking so hard I could barely turn the key in the ignition. My phone buzzed in my lap. It was a text from Ivan.

 ""Just got out of the meeting. So exhausting. I miss you. See you at home."" 

The casual lie, typed out while he stood beside his real family, was the final blow. The world didn't just tilt; it crumbled into dust around me.

I drove away, not toward our shared apartment, but toward a future they couldn't control. The grief was a physical weight, crushing my ch**t. But beneath it, a tiny, hard ember of resolve began to glow.

They thought I was pathetic. They thought I was a fool.

They were about to find out just how wrong they were.


Chapter 2
The next morning, I walked into the apartment I shared with Ivan. He was in the kitchen, making coffee, looking handsome and completely untroubled.

""You're home early,"" he said, smiling as he turned to k**s me. I flinched, turning my head so his lips landed on my cheek.

""Tired,"" I mumbled, using the excuse I knew he'd expect after a long shift. ""The drive back was rough."" 

""Poor baby,"" he said, wrapping his arms around me. His embrace felt like a cage. Every word, every touch was a lie. ""My meeting ran so late. We should do something to celebrate the deal closing. And... it's been five years."" 

I looked at him, my expression carefully blank. ""Five years since what?"" 

""Since Kiera... left,"" he said, his eyes full of fake sympathy. ""I know it was hard on you, what she did. I thought maybe we, and your parents, could have a quiet dinner. To mark the occasion. To celebrate how far we've come."" 

The audacity was breathtaking. They wanted to celebrate the anniversary of the lie they'd built around me. I felt a cold, sharp anger slice through the pain.

""That's... a thoughtful idea, Ivan,"" I said, my voice steady. ""Let's do that."" 

His face lit up with relief. ""Great. I'll let your parents know. They'll be so happy you're in a good place about it."" 

He was so sure of me, so confident in his deception. He left for work, whistling, leaving me alone in the sterile, beautiful apartment that now felt like a prison. The moment the door closed, I went straight to his office.

It was always locked. He'd told me it was because of sensitive work documents. I used to respect that. Now, I knew it was a vault for his secrets. But I was a doctor. I knew about pressure points, about finding weaknesses. And I knew Ivan. His password wasn't complex; it was arrogant. It was the date he proposed to me.

I typed it in. The lock clicked open.

The room was pristine, dominated by a large mahogany desk. I started there. In a locked drawer, I found a small, leather-bound photo album. My hands trembled as I opened it.

It wasn't filled with pictures of us. It was picture after picture of Ivan, Kiera, and their son, Leo. At the park, on a beach, celebrating birthdays with cakes and candles. A perfect, happy family. In one photo, my parents were there, too. My mother was holding Leo, beaming, while my father stood with his arm around Kiera. They looked happier in that stolen moment than I had ever seen them with me.

The evidence was damning, but I needed more. I turned to his laptop. The password was the same. His files were meticulously organized. I found a folder labeled ""Personal."" Inside, another folder: ""L."" 

It was everything. Videos of Leo's first steps. His first words. Scans of his birth certificate, listing Ivan as the father. And a subfolder named ""Finances."" 

I clicked it open and my bl**d ran cold. There were monthly wire transfers from a joint account belonging to my parents, Richard and Eleanor Donovan, to a shell corporation. The amounts were staggering. Millions of dollars over five years. The memo line on each one was the same: ""K.R. Living Expenses."" 

They hadn't just enabled this; they had funded it. Every kind word they'd ever said to me, every expensive gift, every hollow promise of family, was paid for with the same money they used to prop up the woman who tried to ruin me and the secret family my fianc√© was raising with her.

The illusion of their love wasn't just a lie; it was a transaction. I was the price they paid to soothe their guilt over Kiera.

I copied everything onto a small, encrypted flash drive. Every photo, every video, every bank statement. As the files transferred, my phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number.

""Having fun playing detective? You'll never find anything. They love me, Aliana. They always have. You were just a convenient replacement."" 

It was Kiera. She must have had a hidden camera in the office. The thought made my skin crawl.

She sent a picture. It was of the family photo I had just seen, the one with my parents.

""We look good together, don't we? Like a real family."" 

Another message followed. ""Ivan is only with you out of pity. And your parents? They're just paying their dues. You'll always be the outsider, the girl from the foster home who doesn't belong."" 

The taunts were meant to break me. And they did, for a moment. I leaned against the desk, the flash drive clutched in my hand, and a single, hot tear of rage and grief rolled down my cheek.

But then, the grief hardened into something else. Something cold and clear.

She was wrong. I wasn't going to break. I was going to burn their whole world to the ground.


Chapter 3
Kiera's message was a declaration of war. She thought she was untouchable, hidden away in her gilded cage. She didn't know I had the key.

I needed to get inside that house one more time, not just for evidence, but to see the truth with my own eyes, to hear it from their own mouths, unfiltered. The flash drive had the what, but I needed the why.

Bribing a servant was the obvious choice. I reviewed the financial records I'd copied. Kiera's household staff was paid through the shell corporation, but one name stood out-a cleaning service that was paid a surprisingly low, flat monthly fee. A company that likely underpaid its workers. I found their website and the name of the manager. A few thousand dollars, transferred from a burner account, was all it took to get me a uniform and a spot on the next day's cleaning crew for the mansion.

The next afternoon, I pulled up to the service entrance in a nondescript van with three other women. I wore a plain blue uniform, a baseball cap pulled low, and a disposable face mask. I kept my head down and my mouth shut.

The housekeeper, a tired-looking woman named Maria, let us in. She barely glanced at me. ""Upstairs bedrooms and the master suite. Be quick. Mrs. Reese doesn't like to be disturbed."" 

I was assigned to the master suite. The room was enormous, with a stunning view of the city. But I wasn't interested in the view. I was interested in the life they had built here. On the bedside table was a silver frame. It held a picture of Ivan and Kiera on their wedding day. They weren't officially married, of course-Ivan was engaged to me. This was a lie within a lie, a ceremony just for them, a fantasy they lived out in secret.

I moved through the house, cleaning mechanically, my eyes scanning everything. The walls were covered in family portraits. Leo on a pony. Kiera and Ivan laughing on a boat. My father, Richard Donovan, a renowned architect, had designed this house. My mother, Eleanor Donovan, a high-society philanthropist, had decorated it. Her signature taste was everywhere.

I found Maria in the kitchen, wiping down the counters. I kept my voice low and disguised. ""It's a beautiful home. They seem like a very happy family."" 

Maria sighed, not looking at me. ""They are. Mr. Hughes adores that boy. And Mr. Donovan... he's here more than he's at his own home. Taught little Leo how to draw. Says the boy has his talent."" 

The words were a physical blow. My father had never offered to teach me anything. I had begged him to teach me calligraphy, his passion, but he always said he was too busy. He wasn't too busy for Leo.

""And Mrs. Donovan?"" I asked, my voice tight.

""Oh, she spoils Kiera rotten,"" Maria said, shaking her head. ""Brings her new jewelry every week. Says Kiera is the daughter she always wanted, so spirited and strong."" 

The daughter she always wanted. Not me. Not the real daughter who had spent years dreaming of a mother's love.

My stomach churned. I had to get out of there. As I turned to leave the kitchen, I heard the sound of a car in the driveway. A sleek black sedan. Ivan's car.

""They're home early!"" Maria hissed, her eyes wide with panic. ""Quick, hide! In the pantry! They can't see you here after hours."" 

She shoved me into the dark, narrow pantry just as the back door opened. I pressed myself against the shelves, my heart pounding against my ribs. Through the slatted door, I could see them. Ivan, Kiera, and Leo.

Leo was crying. ""But I wanted the blue one!"" 

""I know, sweetie, I know,"" Kiera cooed, st**king his hair. ""Daddy will get you the blue one tomorrow, won't you, Daddy?"" 

""Of course,"" Ivan said. He knelt down and looked at Kiera, his face etched with concern. ""Are you okay, though? You looked pale at the store."" 

""I'm fine,"" Kiera said, but her voice was weary. ""Just tired. It's hard, Ivan. Pretending all the time. Waiting for you to finally get rid of her."" 

My breath caught in my throat.

Ivan stood up and pulled Kiera into his arms. He ki**ed her forehead. ""I know, my love. I know it's not fair to you. But we have to be careful. Just a little longer. Once the new merger is complete, I won't need her family's connections anymore. I'll end it. I promise. Then we can be a real family, out in the open."" 

""You promise?"" she whispered.

""I promise,"" he said, his voice a low, in**mate vow. ""You and Leo are my entire world. Aliana... she's just a means to an end. A placeholder."" 

A placeholder.

The word echoed in the silent pantry. That's all I was. A tool he was using. A temporary fix until he got what he wanted. The love, the engagement, our entire life together-it was a business transaction.

I squeezed my eyes shut, fighting the bile that rose in my throat. I had all the proof I needed. I had the photos, the bank statements, and now, the raw, undeniable truth from his own lips.

I waited until they moved into the living room, their laughter echoing down the hall. I slipped out of the pantry, nodded a silent thank you to a terrified-looking Maria, and walked out the service door without a backward glance.

As I was rounding the corner of the house, heading for the street, Kiera stepped out onto the patio for a phone call. She saw me. Her eyes narrowed, a flicker of recognition in them even with my disguise. She didn't know who I was, but she knew I didn't belong.

""Hey, you!"" she called out. ""What are you still doing here?"" 

I didn't answer. I just picked up my pace, my heart hammering. I couldn't let her see my face. Not yet. The game wasn't over. It had just begun.


Chapter 4
Kiera's suspicion was a dangerous spark. I couldn't risk another close call. The next morning, Maria called me on my burner phone, her voice trembling.

""Mrs. Reese was asking about the new girl. She said you looked familiar. I told her you were my cousin, just filling in for the day. I think she believed me, but she's watching everyone now."" 

""You did well, Maria,"" I said, my voice calm. ""Here's what you do now. Quit. I've deposited a year's salary into your account. Disappear for a while."" 

There was a choked sob on the other end of the line. ""Thank you. God bless you."" 

The line went dead. One loose end tied up. Now for the rest.

I called my best friend, Debi Frost. She wasn't just my friend; she was a shark of a lawyer, the sharpest mind I knew. We met at a noisy downtown coffee shop, a place where no one would notice us.

I laid it all out. The secret house, the child, the five-year lie. I slid the flash drive across the table. Her face, usually so animated, became a mask of cold fury as she listened.

""Those ba**ards,"" she breathed, her knuckles white as she gripped her coffee cup. ""All of them. Your parents, too. Aliana, we are going to destroy them."" 

""I don't want to destroy them, Debi,"" I said quietly. ""I just want to disappear. I want to leave them behind with the truth of what they've done."" 

""Leave? Aliana, you're entitled to half of Ivan's assets, not to mention a massive settlement from your parents for the emotional distress..."" 

""I don't want their money,"" I said, the words tasting like ash. ""Their money is what they used to buy my silence, my compliance. It's tainted. I want nothing from them."" 

Debi studied my face, then nodded slowly. ""Okay. If that's what you want. A clean break. We can do that. We'll prepare the divorce papers, cite infidelity. And a document renouncing any claim to the Donovan family inheritance. We'll make it airtight."" 

As we were planning, my phone buzzed. It was an email from my mother's assistant about the ""anniversary"" dinner Ivan had proposed. The location was set: a private room at The Oak Room, the same restaurant where Ivan and I had our first date. The irony was so thick it was suffocating.

But it was a detail at the bottom of the email that made my bl**d run cold. Debi saw my expression and leaned closer. ""What is it?"" 

I read it aloud, my voice barely a wh**per. ""Please confirm Dr. Donovan's dietary restrictions. The chef notes her mild allergy to benzodiazepines from her hospital records."" 

Debi's eyes widened in horror. ""Benzos? They're going to d**g you?"" 

It clicked into place. The dinner wasn't a celebration. It was a trap. They were afraid that on the anniversary of their great deception, I might finally get emotional, or suspicious. They were going to sedate me, just to make sure their evening went smoothly, to ensure the placeholder didn't cause a scene.

The last flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, there was some twisted, misguided love behind their actions died. This was pure, calculated cruelty.

I started to laugh. It was a hollow, broken sound that had nothing to do with humor. ""Of course,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Of course, they would."" 

Debi reached across the table and grabbed my hand. Her grip was firm, grounding. ""Aliana, you can't go."" 

""Oh, I'm going,"" I said, my eyes hard. ""I'm going to let them think their plan is working perfectly. And then, I'm going to vanish."" 

That afternoon, in Debi's office, I signed the papers. The divorce petition. The legal renunciation of the Donovan name and fortune. With each st**ke of the pen, I felt a chain breaking. I was cutting myself free.

I went online and booked a one-way ticket to a small, coastal town in Oregon under a new name, a name I hadn't used since I was a child in the system, before they found me. A name that was truly mine. The flight was for Saturday night, the night of Leo's fifth birthday party. The party I wasn't invited to. The party that would serve as my grand finale.

When I got back to the apartment, Ivan was there, humming as he packed an overnight bag.

""Just a quick business trip,"" he said, not meeting my eyes. ""Have to fly out tonight, back tomorrow afternoon. Just in time for our dinner."" 

I knew where he was going. He was going to Kiera's. To his son's birthday eve.

""Be safe,"" I said, my voice soft.

He ki**ed me, a quick, dismissive peck on the cheek. ""I love you,"" he said.

""I know,"" I replied, the words a hollow echo.

That night, I lay alone in our bed, the sheets cold beside me. For the first time in five years, the loneliness didn't hurt. It felt like freedom. I was no longer Aliana Donovan, the long-lost daughter, the happy fianc√©e. I was a ghost in my own life, counting down the hours until I could finally disappear.


Chapter 5
The night of the dinner arrived. The night of my departure. My mother, Eleanor, fussed over my dress, her smile painted on.

""You look beautiful, darling. So elegant."" 

My father, Richard, stood by, looking proud. ""Ready for our special night?"" 

They were actors giving the performance of their lives. I was the audience of one, and I knew the whole script.

We sat in the private room at The Oak Room. The air was thick with unspoken words. My mother placed a small bowl of soup in front of me. ""The chef made his specialty just for you. A creamy mushroom bisque."" 

I could smell it. The faint, almost undetectable almond scent of the benzodiazepine mixed in. They didn't even try to be creative. They were arrogant.

""Thank you, Mother,"" I said, picking up my spoon. I looked at her, then at my father. ""It means so much that you're all here. That we can finally put the past behind us."" 

Their faces softened with relief. I was playing my part perfectly. I took a spoonful of the soup. Then another. I ate half the bowl, my stomach clenching with each swallow, not from the d**g, but from the betrayal.

After a few minutes, I pressed a hand to my forehead. ""I'm feeling a little... dizzy. I think the shift at the hospital finally caught up with me."" 

""Oh, you poor thing,"" Eleanor said, her concern a masterpiece of fiction. ""Of course. You should rest."" 

""Would you mind if I just... went to the powder room for a moment?"" I asked, my voice intentionally weak.

""Go, go,"" Richard urged. ""We'll be right here."" 

I gave them one last look. My parents. The people who were supposed to love me unconditionally.

""Were you ever sorry?"" I asked, the question slipping out before I could stop it. ""For what happened to me? For all the years I was gone?"" 

They stared at me, their smiles faltering. There was a flicker of something in their eyes-guilt, maybe-but it was quickly extinguished.

""Of course, we were, Aliana,"" my father said, his voice a little too firm. ""Every single day."" 

A lie. Another one. I didn't press. I just nodded. ""I'm glad."" 

I walked toward the back of the restaurant, my steps steady. Once inside the empty, opulent bathroom, I locked the door, knelt before the toilet, and forced myself to throw up, my body convulsing until the soup and the poison were gone. I rinsed my mouth, my face pale but my eyes clear in the mirror.

The dizziness was an act, but the nausea was real.

When I returned to the apartment I had once shared with Ivan, he was waiting. He was dressed for the party, Kiera's party, his face glowing with anticipation. He held out a glass of champagne.

""A toast,"" he said, smiling. ""To us. To our future."" 

I saw the fine powder lingering at the bottom of my glass. A second dose. They were making sure.

I played the part of the smitten fianc√©e one last time. ""To us,"" I echoed, my voice light and airy. I let him think I was dizzy from the dinner, leaning on him slightly.

""I have to go to the hospital for a bit,"" he said, the lie rolling off his tongue with practiced ease. ""An emergency consult. I'll be back as late as I can."" 

""Don't worry about me,"" I said. I took the glass of champagne and, looking him directly in the eye, drank it all down in one go. His smile widened. He thought he had won.

""I'll see you later,"" he said, giving me a quick k**s. He walked out the door without a second glance. He never looked back.

The moment he was gone, I ran to the bathroom and purged the champagne, my body shaking with the effort. When I was done, I felt strangely calm. Cleansed.

I changed into simple, dark clothing. I walked into the living room, where a single, elegantly wrapped gift box sat on the coffee table. I had prepared it that afternoon.

I called the butler from the Donovan estate, a man who had shown me small kindnesses over the years. ""James,"" I said. ""I have a package that needs to be delivered to the party at 10 p.m. precisely. Not before, not after. Can you do that for me?"" 

""Of course, Dr. Donovan,"" he said, his voice steady.

Inside the box was the flash drive, a small portable speaker, and a single, handwritten card.

My final stop was a quiet street overlooking the secret mansion. The party was in full swing. I could see them all through the windows-Ivan, Kiera, Leo, my parents-laughing, celebrating a life built on my pain. They looked so happy.

My phone buzzed. A message from Debi. ""Wheels up in 30. You're free."" 

I looked at the scene one last time, a tableau of their perfect, fake happiness. I felt nothing. No anger, no sadness. Just a profound, empty peace.

I dropped my phone into a storm drain, the screen shattering on the concrete below. I had already canceled the number, wiped the data.

I was Aliana Donovan, a resident physician, finally reunited with the wealthy family I'd been lost from as a child. I had loving parents and a handsome, successful fianc√©. I was safe. I was loved. It was a perfect, fragile lie.

The lie shattered on a Tuesday when I discovered my fianc√©, Ivan, wasn't at a board meeting but at a sprawling mansion with Kiera Reese, the woman I was told had a mental breakdown five years ago after trying to frame me.

She wasn't disgraced; she was radiant, holding a little boy, Leo, who giggled in Ivan's arms. 

I overheard their conversation: Leo was their son, and I was merely a ""placeholder,"" a means to an end until Ivan no longer needed my family's connections. My parents, the Donovans, were in on it, funding Kiera's lavish life and their secret family.

My entire reality-the loving parents, the devoted fianc√©, the security I thought I'd found-was a carefully constructed stage, and I was the fool playing the lead role. The casual lie Ivan texted me, ""Just got out of the meeting. So ex**usting. I miss you. See you at home,"" while he stood beside his real family, was the final blow.

They thought I was pathetic. They thought I was a fool. They were about to find out just how wrong they were.


Chapter 1
Five years. That's how long they told me Kiera Reese had been gone. Five years since she'd had a supposed mental breakdown after trying to frame me for leaking corporate secrets, a move that nearly destroyed my medical career. My fianc√©, Ivan Hughes, and my parents, the Donovans, had assured me she was sent away to get help, disgraced and removed from our lives forever.

I believed them. I was Aliana Donovan, a resident physician, finally reunited with the wealthy family I'd been lost from as a child. I had loving parents and a handsome, successful fianc√©. I was safe. I was loved. It was a perfect, fragile lie.

The lie shattered on a Tuesday.

Ivan was supposed to be at a board meeting. He had texted me, ""Thinking of you. It's going to be a long night. Don't wait up."" 

But I wanted to surprise him. I had just finished a grueling 36-hour shift at the hospital and drove to his office building, Hughes Biomedical, with his favorite takeout. The security guard in the lobby gave me a polite smile. ""Mr. Hughes left about an hour ago, Dr. Donovan."" 

A cold knot formed in my stomach. I called his phone. It rang once, then went to voicemail. I tried the tracker on his car, a feature I'd only ever used once when he'd misplaced it in a massive parking garage. The glowing dot on my phone screen wasn't anywhere near his usual routes. It was heading toward a gated community on the other side of town, a place I'd never even heard of.

I drove, my hands tight on the steering wheel. The cold knot in my stomach grew, tightening with every mile. The address led me to a sprawling modern mansion, lights blazing, music spilling out into the manicured gardens. It looked like a party.

I parked down the street and walked toward the house. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I saw a scene that didn't make sense. And then, I saw him. My fianc√©, Ivan. He wasn't in a suit. He was in casual clothes, a relaxed smile on his face.

He was holding a little boy on his shoulders, maybe four or five years old. The boy was giggling, his small hands tangled in Ivan's dark hair.

And then I saw the woman standing next to them, her hand resting on Ivan's arm.

Kiera Reese.

She wasn't disgraced. She wasn't in a treatment facility. She was radiant, dressed in a silk gown, looking every bit the happy mother and partner. She laughed, a sound I remembered with a shudder, and leaned in to k**s Ivan on the cheek. He turned his head and ki**ed her back, a familiar, loving gesture that he had used with me just that morning.

My breath hitched. The world tilted on its axis. I stumbled back into the shadows of a large oak tree, my body trembling.

I could hear their voices through the slightly open patio door.

""Leo is getting so big,"" Kiera said, her voice dripping with contentment. ""He looks more like you every day."" 

""He has his mother's charm,"" Ivan replied, his voice warm with an affection I now realized I had never truly received. He lifted the boy, Leo, off his shoulders and set him down.

""Are you sure Aliana doesn't suspect anything?"" Kiera asked, her tone shifting slightly. ""Five years is a long time to keep this up."" 

""She doesn't have a clue,"" Ivan said, his voice laced with a casual cruelty that stole the air from my lungs. ""She's so grateful to have a family, she'd believe anything we tell her. It's almost sad."" 

""Poor, pathetic Aliana,"" Kiera sneered. ""Still thinks you're going to marry her. Still thinks Mommy and Daddy Donovan love their real daughter more than me."" 

Ivan laughed. It wasn't a nice sound. ""They feel guilty. That's all. They know they owe you. We all do. This house, this life... it's the least we could do to make up for what you  'went through'."" 

He said ""went through"" with air quotes. The whole story of her breakdown was a performance. A lie they all participated in.

I felt a wave of nausea. My parents. They were in on it, too. The money for this lavish life, this secret family, it came from them. From the Donovan fortune that was supposed to be mine.

My entire reality-the loving parents, the devoted fianc√©, the security I thought I'd finally found after a childhood in foster care-was a carefully constructed stage. And I was the fool playing the lead role, unaware that the rest of the cast was laughing at me behind the curtain.

I backed away slowly, my movements wooden. I got into my car, my body shaking so hard I could barely turn the key in the ignition. My phone buzzed in my lap. It was a text from Ivan.

 ""Just got out of the meeting. So exhausting. I miss you. See you at home."" 

The casual lie, typed out while he stood beside his real family, was the final blow. The world didn't just tilt; it crumbled into dust around me.

I drove away, not toward our shared apartment, but toward a future they couldn't control. The grief was a physical weight, crushing my ch**t. But beneath it, a tiny, hard ember of resolve began to glow.

They thought I was pathetic. They thought I was a fool.

They were about to find out just how wrong they were.


Chapter 2
The next morning, I walked into the apartment I shared with Ivan. He was in the kitchen, making coffee, looking handsome and completely untroubled.

""You're home early,"" he said, smiling as he turned to k**s me. I flinched, turning my head so his lips landed on my cheek.

""Tired,"" I mumbled, using the excuse I knew he'd expect after a long shift. ""The drive back was rough."" 

""Poor baby,"" he said, wrapping his arms around me. His embrace felt like a cage. Every word, every touch was a lie. ""My meeting ran so late. We should do something to celebrate the deal closing. And... it's been five years."" 

I looked at him, my expression carefully blank. ""Five years since what?"" 

""Since Kiera... left,"" he said, his eyes full of fake sympathy. ""I know it was hard on you, what she did. I thought maybe we, and your parents, could have a quiet dinner. To mark the occasion. To celebrate how far we've come."" 

The audacity was breathtaking. They wanted to celebrate the anniversary of the lie they'd built around me. I felt a cold, sharp anger slice through the pain.

""That's... a thoughtful idea, Ivan,"" I said, my voice steady. ""Let's do that."" 

His face lit up with relief. ""Great. I'll let your parents know. They'll be so happy you're in a good place about it."" 

He was so sure of me, so confident in his deception. He left for work, whistling, leaving me alone in the sterile, beautiful apartment that now felt like a prison. The moment the door closed, I went straight to his office.

It was always locked. He'd told me it was because of sensitive work documents. I used to respect that. Now, I knew it was a vault for his secrets. But I was a doctor. I knew about pressure points, about finding weaknesses. And I knew Ivan. His password wasn't complex; it was arrogant. It was the date he proposed to me.

I typed it in. The lock clicked open.

The room was pristine, dominated by a large mahogany desk. I started there. In a locked drawer, I found a small, leather-bound photo album. My hands trembled as I opened it.

It wasn't filled with pictures of us. It was picture after picture of Ivan, Kiera, and their son, Leo. At the park, on a beach, celebrating birthdays with cakes and candles. A perfect, happy family. In one photo, my parents were there, too. My mother was holding Leo, beaming, while my father stood with his arm around Kiera. They looked happier in that stolen moment than I had ever seen them with me.

The evidence was damning, but I needed more. I turned to his laptop. The password was the same. His files were meticulously organized. I found a folder labeled ""Personal."" Inside, another folder: ""L."" 

It was everything. Videos of Leo's first steps. His first words. Scans of his birth certificate, listing Ivan as the father. And a subfolder named ""Finances."" 

I clicked it open and my bl**d ran cold. There were monthly wire transfers from a joint account belonging to my parents, Richard and Eleanor Donovan, to a shell corporation. The amounts were staggering. Millions of dollars over five years. The memo line on each one was the same: ""K.R. Living Expenses."" 

They hadn't just enabled this; they had funded it. Every kind word they'd ever said to me, every expensive gift, every hollow promise of family, was paid for with the same money they used to prop up the woman who tried to ruin me and the secret family my fianc√© was raising with her.

The illusion of their love wasn't just a lie; it was a transaction. I was the price they paid to soothe their guilt over Kiera.

I copied everything onto a small, encrypted flash drive. Every photo, every video, every bank statement. As the files transferred, my phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number.

""Having fun playing detective? You'll never find anything. They love me, Aliana. They always have. You were just a convenient replacement."" 

It was Kiera. She must have had a hidden camera in the office. The thought made my skin crawl.

She sent a picture. It was of the family photo I had just seen, the one with my parents.

""We look good together, don't we? Like a real family."" 

Another message followed. ""Ivan is only with you out of pity. And your parents? They're just paying their dues. You'll always be the outsider, the girl from the foster home who doesn't belong."" 

The taunts were meant to break me. And they did, for a moment. I leaned against the desk, the flash drive clutched in my hand, and a single, hot tear of rage and grief rolled down my cheek.

But then, the grief hardened into something else. Something cold and clear.

She was wrong. I wasn't going to break. I was going to burn their whole world to the ground.


Chapter 3
Kiera's message was a declaration of war. She thought she was untouchable, hidden away in her gilded cage. She didn't know I had the key.

I needed to get inside that house one more time, not just for evidence, but to see the truth with my own eyes, to hear it from their own mouths, unfiltered. The flash drive had the what, but I needed the why.

Bribing a servant was the obvious choice. I reviewed the financial records I'd copied. Kiera's household staff was paid through the shell corporation, but one name stood out-a cleaning service that was paid a surprisingly low, flat monthly fee. A company that likely underpaid its workers. I found their website and the name of the manager. A few thousand dollars, transferred from a burner account, was all it took to get me a uniform and a spot on the next day's cleaning crew for the mansion.

The next afternoon, I pulled up to the service entrance in a nondescript van with three other women. I wore a plain blue uniform, a baseball cap pulled low, and a disposable face mask. I kept my head down and my mouth shut.

The housekeeper, a tired-looking woman named Maria, let us in. She barely glanced at me. ""Upstairs bedrooms and the master suite. Be quick. Mrs. Reese doesn't like to be disturbed."" 

I was assigned to the master suite. The room was enormous, with a stunning view of the city. But I wasn't interested in the view. I was interested in the life they had built here. On the bedside table was a silver frame. It held a picture of Ivan and Kiera on their wedding day. They weren't officially married, of course-Ivan was engaged to me. This was a lie within a lie, a ceremony just for them, a fantasy they lived out in secret.

I moved through the house, cleaning mechanically, my eyes scanning everything. The walls were covered in family portraits. Leo on a pony. Kiera and Ivan laughing on a boat. My father, Richard Donovan, a renowned architect, had designed this house. My mother, Eleanor Donovan, a high-society philanthropist, had decorated it. Her signature taste was everywhere.

I found Maria in the kitchen, wiping down the counters. I kept my voice low and disguised. ""It's a beautiful home. They seem like a very happy family."" 

Maria sighed, not looking at me. ""They are. Mr. Hughes adores that boy. And Mr. Donovan... he's here more than he's at his own home. Taught little Leo how to draw. Says the boy has his talent."" 

The words were a physical blow. My father had never offered to teach me anything. I had begged him to teach me calligraphy, his passion, but he always said he was too busy. He wasn't too busy for Leo.

""And Mrs. Donovan?"" I asked, my voice tight.

""Oh, she spoils Kiera rotten,"" Maria said, shaking her head. ""Brings her new jewelry every week. Says Kiera is the daughter she always wanted, so spirited and strong."" 

The daughter she always wanted. Not me. Not the real daughter who had spent years dreaming of a mother's love.

My stomach churned. I had to get out of there. As I turned to leave the kitchen, I heard the sound of a car in the driveway. A sleek black sedan. Ivan's car.

""They're home early!"" Maria hissed, her eyes wide with panic. ""Quick, hide! In the pantry! They can't see you here after hours."" 

She shoved me into the dark, narrow pantry just as the back door opened. I pressed myself against the shelves, my heart pounding against my ribs. Through the slatted door, I could see them. Ivan, Kiera, and Leo.

Leo was crying. ""But I wanted the blue one!"" 

""I know, sweetie, I know,"" Kiera cooed, st**king his hair. ""Daddy will get you the blue one tomorrow, won't you, Daddy?"" 

""Of course,"" Ivan said. He knelt down and looked at Kiera, his face etched with concern. ""Are you okay, though? You looked pale at the store."" 

""I'm fine,"" Kiera said, but her voice was weary. ""Just tired. It's hard, Ivan. Pretending all the time. Waiting for you to finally get rid of her."" 

My breath caught in my throat.

Ivan stood up and pulled Kiera into his arms. He ki**ed her forehead. ""I know, my love. I know it's not fair to you. But we have to be careful. Just a little longer. Once the new merger is complete, I won't need her family's connections anymore. I'll end it. I promise. Then we can be a real family, out in the open."" 

""You promise?"" she whispered.

""I promise,"" he said, his voice a low, in**mate vow. ""You and Leo are my entire world. Aliana... she's just a means to an end. A placeholder."" 

A placeholder.

The word echoed in the silent pantry. That's all I was. A tool he was using. A temporary fix until he got what he wanted. The love, the engagement, our entire life together-it was a business transaction.

I squeezed my eyes shut, fighting the bile that rose in my throat. I had all the proof I needed. I had the photos, the bank statements, and now, the raw, undeniable truth from his own lips.

I waited until they moved into the living room, their laughter echoing down the hall. I slipped out of the pantry, nodded a silent thank you to a terrified-looking Maria, and walked out the service door without a backward glance.

As I was rounding the corner of the house, heading for the street, Kiera stepped out onto the patio for a phone call. She saw me. Her eyes narrowed, a flicker of recognition in them even with my disguise. She didn't know who I was, but she knew I didn't belong.

""Hey, you!"" she called out. ""What are you still doing here?"" 

I didn't answer. I just picked up my pace, my heart hammering. I couldn't let her see my face. Not yet. The game wasn't over. It had just begun.


Chapter 4
Kiera's suspicion was a dangerous spark. I couldn't risk another close call. The next morning, Maria called me on my burner phone, her voice trembling.

""Mrs. Reese was asking about the new girl. She said you looked familiar. I told her you were my cousin, just filling in for the day. I think she believed me, but she's watching everyone now."" 

""You did well, Maria,"" I said, my voice calm. ""Here's what you do now. Quit. I've deposited a year's salary into your account. Disappear for a while."" 

There was a choked sob on the other end of the line. ""Thank you. God bless you."" 

The line went dead. One loose end tied up. Now for the rest.

I called my best friend, Debi Frost. She wasn't just my friend; she was a shark of a lawyer, the sharpest mind I knew. We met at a noisy downtown coffee shop, a place where no one would notice us.

I laid it all out. The secret house, the child, the five-year lie. I slid the flash drive across the table. Her face, usually so animated, became a mask of cold fury as she listened.

""Those ba**ards,"" she breathed, her knuckles white as she gripped her coffee cup. ""All of them. Your parents, too. Aliana, we are going to destroy them."" 

""I don't want to destroy them, Debi,"" I said quietly. ""I just want to disappear. I want to leave them behind with the truth of what they've done."" 

""Leave? Aliana, you're entitled to half of Ivan's assets, not to mention a massive settlement from your parents for the emotional distress..."" 

""I don't want their money,"" I said, the words tasting like ash. ""Their money is what they used to buy my silence, my compliance. It's tainted. I want nothing from them."" 

Debi studied my face, then nodded slowly. ""Okay. If that's what you want. A clean break. We can do that. We'll prepare the divorce papers, cite infidelity. And a document renouncing any claim to the Donovan family inheritance. We'll make it airtight."" 

As we were planning, my phone buzzed. It was an email from my mother's assistant about the ""anniversary"" dinner Ivan had proposed. The location was set: a private room at The Oak Room, the same restaurant where Ivan and I had our first date. The irony was so thick it was suffocating.

But it was a detail at the bottom of the email that made my bl**d run cold. Debi saw my expression and leaned closer. ""What is it?"" 

I read it aloud, my voice barely a wh**per. ""Please confirm Dr. Donovan's dietary restrictions. The chef notes her mild allergy to benzodiazepines from her hospital records."" 

Debi's eyes widened in horror. ""Benzos? They're going to d**g you?"" 

It clicked into place. The dinner wasn't a celebration. It was a trap. They were afraid that on the anniversary of their great deception, I might finally get emotional, or suspicious. They were going to sedate me, just to make sure their evening went smoothly, to ensure the placeholder didn't cause a scene.

The last flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, there was some twisted, misguided love behind their actions died. This was pure, calculated cruelty.

I started to laugh. It was a hollow, broken sound that had nothing to do with humor. ""Of course,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Of course, they would."" 

Debi reached across the table and grabbed my hand. Her grip was firm, grounding. ""Aliana, you can't go."" 

""Oh, I'm going,"" I said, my eyes hard. ""I'm going to let them think their plan is working perfectly. And then, I'm going to vanish."" 

That afternoon, in Debi's office, I signed the papers. The divorce petition. The legal renunciation of the Donovan name and fortune. With each st**ke of the pen, I felt a chain breaking. I was cutting myself free.

I went online and booked a one-way ticket to a small, coastal town in Oregon under a new name, a name I hadn't used since I was a child in the system, before they found me. A name that was truly mine. The flight was for Saturday night, the night of Leo's fifth birthday party. The party I wasn't invited to. The party that would serve as my grand finale.

When I got back to the apartment, Ivan was there, humming as he packed an overnight bag.

""Just a quick business trip,"" he said, not meeting my eyes. ""Have to fly out tonight, back tomorrow afternoon. Just in time for our dinner."" 

I knew where he was going. He was going to Kiera's. To his son's birthday eve.

""Be safe,"" I said, my voice soft.

He ki**ed me, a quick, dismissive peck on the cheek. ""I love you,"" he said.

""I know,"" I replied, the words a hollow echo.

That night, I lay alone in our bed, the sheets cold beside me. For the first time in five years, the loneliness didn't hurt. It felt like freedom. I was no longer Aliana Donovan, the long-lost daughter, the happy fianc√©e. I was a ghost in my own life, counting down the hours until I could finally disappear.


Chapter 5
The night of the dinner arrived. The night of my departure. My mother, Eleanor, fussed over my dress, her smile painted on.

""You look beautiful, darling. So elegant."" 

My father, Richard, stood by, looking proud. ""Ready for our special night?"" 

They were actors giving the performance of their lives. I was the audience of one, and I knew the whole script.

We sat in the private room at The Oak Room. The air was thick with unspoken words. My mother placed a small bowl of soup in front of me. ""The chef made his specialty just for you. A creamy mushroom bisque."" 

I could smell it. The faint, almost undetectable almond scent of the benzodiazepine mixed in. They didn't even try to be creative. They were arrogant.

""Thank you, Mother,"" I said, picking up my spoon. I looked at her, then at my father. ""It means so much that you're all here. That we can finally put the past behind us."" 

Their faces softened with relief. I was playing my part perfectly. I took a spoonful of the soup. Then another. I ate half the bowl, my stomach clenching with each swallow, not from the d**g, but from the betrayal.

After a few minutes, I pressed a hand to my forehead. ""I'm feeling a little... dizzy. I think the shift at the hospital finally caught up with me."" 

""Oh, you poor thing,"" Eleanor said, her concern a masterpiece of fiction. ""Of course. You should rest."" 

""Would you mind if I just... went to the powder room for a moment?"" I asked, my voice intentionally weak.

""Go, go,"" Richard urged. ""We'll be right here."" 

I gave them one last look. My parents. The people who were supposed to love me unconditionally.

""Were you ever sorry?"" I asked, the question slipping out before I could stop it. ""For what happened to me? For all the years I was gone?"" 

They stared at me, their smiles faltering. There was a flicker of something in their eyes-guilt, maybe-but it was quickly extinguished.

""Of course, we were, Aliana,"" my father said, his voice a little too firm. ""Every single day."" 

A lie. Another one. I didn't press. I just nodded. ""I'm glad."" 

I walked toward the back of the restaurant, my steps steady. Once inside the empty, opulent bathroom, I locked the door, knelt before the toilet, and forced myself to throw up, my body convulsing until the soup and the poison were gone. I rinsed my mouth, my face pale but my eyes clear in the mirror.

The dizziness was an act, but the nausea was real.

When I returned to the apartment I had once shared with Ivan, he was waiting. He was dressed for the party, Kiera's party, his face glowing with anticipation. He held out a glass of champagne.

""A toast,"" he said, smiling. ""To us. To our future."" 

I saw the fine powder lingering at the bottom of my glass. A second dose. They were making sure.

I played the part of the smitten fianc√©e one last time. ""To us,"" I echoed, my voice light and airy. I let him think I was dizzy from the dinner, leaning on him slightly.

""I have to go to the hospital for a bit,"" he said, the lie rolling off his tongue with practiced ease. ""An emergency consult. I'll be back as late as I can."" 

""Don't worry about me,"" I said. I took the glass of champagne and, looking him directly in the eye, drank it all down in one go. His smile widened. He thought he had won.

""I'll see you later,"" he said, giving me a quick k**s. He walked out the door without a second glance. He never looked back.

The moment he was gone, I ran to the bathroom and purged the champagne, my body shaking with the effort. When I was done, I felt strangely calm. Cleansed.

I changed into simple, dark clothing. I walked into the living room, where a single, elegantly wrapped gift box sat on the coffee table. I had prepared it that afternoon.

I called the butler from the Donovan estate, a man who had shown me small kindnesses over the years. ""James,"" I said. ""I have a package that needs to be delivered to the party at 10 p.m. precisely. Not before, not after. Can you do that for me?"" 

""Of course, Dr. Donovan,"" he said, his voice steady.

Inside the box was the flash drive, a small portable speaker, and a single, handwritten card.

My final stop was a quiet street overlooking the secret mansion. The party was in full swing. I could see them all through the windows-Ivan, Kiera, Leo, my parents-laughing, celebrating a life built on my pain. They looked so happy.

My phone buzzed. A message from Debi. ""Wheels up in 30. You're free."" 

I looked at the scene one last time, a tableau of their perfect, fake happiness. I felt nothing. No anger, no sadness. Just a profound, empty peace.

I dropped my phone into a storm drain, the screen shattering on the concrete below. I had already canceled the number, wiped the data.

Hello, ever since I was a child or younger, I always went once a day or every two days, but after a while I notice that I go once every two days. I've never had blood in my stool. Sometimes it's thin, but not exactly like a pencil, but separated and maybe 2 cm or 1.5 cm in diameter. It happens to me sometimes: I go in the morning normally, and then weirdly I have to go to get some of the rest out. I didnt drink. Alot of water before or fiber neither now after this week I do an i can see better stools and shapes not thin but before it wasnt diarrhea all the time it was solid but sometimes hard and a few ones

I hardly ever have abdominal pain unless I drink milk or something hurts me. I was relaxed and fine these past few months, but until I read about colon c*ncer and its symptoms every day on Google, and out of nowhere, it scared me and traumatized me, so much so that I spend every minute worrying about my stomach or intestines, wondering if they're making noise or not, or whether I have thin stools, etc. I used to go to the bathroom whenever my body wanted to, day or night or whenever. But now, ever since that day I read things on the internet, I have the feeling that I always want to go to the bathroom to defecate. Before I got scared, that didn't happen to me. I didn't have anxiety. I would just say, ""Okay, I go to the bathroom more often, but everything's fine, there's no blood or pain."" And now, all I have is thinking about this, mostly from reading that someone might not have symptoms and be in the terminal or advanced stages without realizing it. All the fear was just from going to the bathroom twice instead of once like before. Something to mention is that lately I was eating more junk food and a lot of coffee and alcohol on the weekends continuously.

I was Aliana Donovan, a resident physician, finally reunited with the wealthy family I'd been lost from as a child. I had loving parents and a handsome, successful fianc√©. I was safe. I was loved. It was a perfect, fragile lie.

The lie shattered on a Tuesday when I discovered my fianc√©, Ivan, wasn't at a board meeting but at a sprawling mansion with Kiera Reese, the woman I was told had a mental breakdown five years ago after trying to frame me.

She wasn't disgraced; she was radiant, holding a little boy, Leo, who giggled in Ivan's arms. 

I overheard their conversation: Leo was their son, and I was merely a ""placeholder,"" a means to an end until Ivan no longer needed my family's connections. My parents, the Donovans, were in on it, funding Kiera's lavish life and their secret family.

My entire reality-the loving parents, the devoted fianc√©, the security I thought I'd found-was a carefully constructed stage, and I was the fool playing the lead role. The casual lie Ivan texted me, ""Just got out of the meeting. So ex**usting. I miss you. See you at home,"" while he stood beside his real family, was the final blow.

They thought I was pathetic. They thought I was a fool. They were about to find out just how wrong they were.


Chapter 1
Five years. That's how long they told me Kiera Reese had been gone. Five years since she'd had a supposed mental breakdown after trying to frame me for leaking corporate secrets, a move that nearly destroyed my medical career. My fianc√©, Ivan Hughes, and my parents, the Donovans, had assured me she was sent away to get help, disgraced and removed from our lives forever.

I believed them. I was Aliana Donovan, a resident physician, finally reunited with the wealthy family I'd been lost from as a child. I had loving parents and a handsome, successful fianc√©. I was safe. I was loved. It was a perfect, fragile lie.

The lie shattered on a Tuesday.

Ivan was supposed to be at a board meeting. He had texted me, ""Thinking of you. It's going to be a long night. Don't wait up."" 

But I wanted to surprise him. I had just finished a grueling 36-hour shift at the hospital and drove to his office building, Hughes Biomedical, with his favorite takeout. The security guard in the lobby gave me a polite smile. ""Mr. Hughes left about an hour ago, Dr. Donovan."" 

A cold knot formed in my stomach. I called his phone. It rang once, then went to voicemail. I tried the tracker on his car, a feature I'd only ever used once when he'd misplaced it in a massive parking garage. The glowing dot on my phone screen wasn't anywhere near his usual routes. It was heading toward a gated community on the other side of town, a place I'd never even heard of.

I drove, my hands tight on the steering wheel. The cold knot in my stomach grew, tightening with every mile. The address led me to a sprawling modern mansion, lights blazing, music spilling out into the manicured gardens. It looked like a party.

I parked down the street and walked toward the house. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I saw a scene that didn't make sense. And then, I saw him. My fianc√©, Ivan. He wasn't in a suit. He was in casual clothes, a relaxed smile on his face.

He was holding a little boy on his shoulders, maybe four or five years old. The boy was giggling, his small hands tangled in Ivan's dark hair.

And then I saw the woman standing next to them, her hand resting on Ivan's arm.

Kiera Reese.

She wasn't disgraced. She wasn't in a treatment facility. She was radiant, dressed in a silk gown, looking every bit the happy mother and partner. She laughed, a sound I remembered with a shudder, and leaned in to k**s Ivan on the cheek. He turned his head and ki**ed her back, a familiar, loving gesture that he had used with me just that morning.

My breath hitched. The world tilted on its axis. I stumbled back into the shadows of a large oak tree, my body trembling.

I could hear their voices through the slightly open patio door.

""Leo is getting so big,"" Kiera said, her voice dripping with contentment. ""He looks more like you every day."" 

""He has his mother's charm,"" Ivan replied, his voice warm with an affection I now realized I had never truly received. He lifted the boy, Leo, off his shoulders and set him down.

""Are you sure Aliana doesn't suspect anything?"" Kiera asked, her tone shifting slightly. ""Five years is a long time to keep this up."" 

""She doesn't have a clue,"" Ivan said, his voice laced with a casual cruelty that stole the air from my lungs. ""She's so grateful to have a family, she'd believe anything we tell her. It's almost sad."" 

""Poor, pathetic Aliana,"" Kiera sneered. ""Still thinks you're going to marry her. Still thinks Mommy and Daddy Donovan love their real daughter more than me."" 

Ivan laughed. It wasn't a nice sound. ""They feel guilty. That's all. They know they owe you. We all do. This house, this life... it's the least we could do to make up for what you  'went through'."" 

He said ""went through"" with air quotes. The whole story of her breakdown was a performance. A lie they all participated in.

I felt a wave of nausea. My parents. They were in on it, too. The money for this lavish life, this secret family, it came from them. From the Donovan fortune that was supposed to be mine.

My entire reality-the loving parents, the devoted fianc√©, the security I thought I'd finally found after a childhood in foster care-was a carefully constructed stage. And I was the fool playing the lead role, unaware that the rest of the cast was laughing at me behind the curtain.

I backed away slowly, my movements wooden. I got into my car, my body shaking so hard I could barely turn the key in the ignition. My phone buzzed in my lap. It was a text from Ivan.

 ""Just got out of the meeting. So exhausting. I miss you. See you at home."" 

The casual lie, typed out while he stood beside his real family, was the final blow. The world didn't just tilt; it crumbled into dust around me.

I drove away, not toward our shared apartment, but toward a future they couldn't control. The grief was a physical weight, crushing my ch**t. But beneath it, a tiny, hard ember of resolve began to glow.

They thought I was pathetic. They thought I was a fool.

They were about to find out just how wrong they were.


Chapter 2
The next morning, I walked into the apartment I shared with Ivan. He was in the kitchen, making coffee, looking handsome and completely untroubled.

""You're home early,"" he said, smiling as he turned to k**s me. I flinched, turning my head so his lips landed on my cheek.

""Tired,"" I mumbled, using the excuse I knew he'd expect after a long shift. ""The drive back was rough."" 

""Poor baby,"" he said, wrapping his arms around me. His embrace felt like a cage. Every word, every touch was a lie. ""My meeting ran so late. We should do something to celebrate the deal closing. And... it's been five years."" 

I looked at him, my expression carefully blank. ""Five years since what?"" 

""Since Kiera... left,"" he said, his eyes full of fake sympathy. ""I know it was hard on you, what she did. I thought maybe we, and your parents, could have a quiet dinner. To mark the occasion. To celebrate how far we've come."" 

The audacity was breathtaking. They wanted to celebrate the anniversary of the lie they'd built around me. I felt a cold, sharp anger slice through the pain.

""That's... a thoughtful idea, Ivan,"" I said, my voice steady. ""Let's do that."" 

His face lit up with relief. ""Great. I'll let your parents know. They'll be so happy you're in a good place about it."" 

He was so sure of me, so confident in his deception. He left for work, whistling, leaving me alone in the sterile, beautiful apartment that now felt like a prison. The moment the door closed, I went straight to his office.

It was always locked. He'd told me it was because of sensitive work documents. I used to respect that. Now, I knew it was a vault for his secrets. But I was a doctor. I knew about pressure points, about finding weaknesses. And I knew Ivan. His password wasn't complex; it was arrogant. It was the date he proposed to me.

I typed it in. The lock clicked open.

The room was pristine, dominated by a large mahogany desk. I started there. In a locked drawer, I found a small, leather-bound photo album. My hands trembled as I opened it.

It wasn't filled with pictures of us. It was picture after picture of Ivan, Kiera, and their son, Leo. At the park, on a beach, celebrating birthdays with cakes and candles. A perfect, happy family. In one photo, my parents were there, too. My mother was holding Leo, beaming, while my father stood with his arm around Kiera. They looked happier in that stolen moment than I had ever seen them with me.

The evidence was damning, but I needed more. I turned to his laptop. The password was the same. His files were meticulously organized. I found a folder labeled ""Personal."" Inside, another folder: ""L."" 

It was everything. Videos of Leo's first steps. His first words. Scans of his birth certificate, listing Ivan as the father. And a subfolder named ""Finances."" 

I clicked it open and my bl**d ran cold. There were monthly wire transfers from a joint account belonging to my parents, Richard and Eleanor Donovan, to a shell corporation. The amounts were staggering. Millions of dollars over five years. The memo line on each one was the same: ""K.R. Living Expenses."" 

They hadn't just enabled this; they had funded it. Every kind word they'd ever said to me, every expensive gift, every hollow promise of family, was paid for with the same money they used to prop up the woman who tried to ruin me and the secret family my fianc√© was raising with her.

The illusion of their love wasn't just a lie; it was a transaction. I was the price they paid to soothe their guilt over Kiera.

I copied everything onto a small, encrypted flash drive. Every photo, every video, every bank statement. As the files transferred, my phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number.

""Having fun playing detective? You'll never find anything. They love me, Aliana. They always have. You were just a convenient replacement."" 

It was Kiera. She must have had a hidden camera in the office. The thought made my skin crawl.

She sent a picture. It was of the family photo I had just seen, the one with my parents.

""We look good together, don't we? Like a real family."" 

Another message followed. ""Ivan is only with you out of pity. And your parents? They're just paying their dues. You'll always be the outsider, the girl from the foster home who doesn't belong."" 

The taunts were meant to break me. And they did, for a moment. I leaned against the desk, the flash drive clutched in my hand, and a single, hot tear of rage and grief rolled down my cheek.

But then, the grief hardened into something else. Something cold and clear.

She was wrong. I wasn't going to break. I was going to burn their whole world to the ground.


Chapter 3
Kiera's message was a declaration of war. She thought she was untouchable, hidden away in her gilded cage. She didn't know I had the key.

I needed to get inside that house one more time, not just for evidence, but to see the truth with my own eyes, to hear it from their own mouths, unfiltered. The flash drive had the what, but I needed the why.

Bribing a servant was the obvious choice. I reviewed the financial records I'd copied. Kiera's household staff was paid through the shell corporation, but one name stood out-a cleaning service that was paid a surprisingly low, flat monthly fee. A company that likely underpaid its workers. I found their website and the name of the manager. A few thousand dollars, transferred from a burner account, was all it took to get me a uniform and a spot on the next day's cleaning crew for the mansion.

The next afternoon, I pulled up to the service entrance in a nondescript van with three other women. I wore a plain blue uniform, a baseball cap pulled low, and a disposable face mask. I kept my head down and my mouth shut.

The housekeeper, a tired-looking woman named Maria, let us in. She barely glanced at me. ""Upstairs bedrooms and the master suite. Be quick. Mrs. Reese doesn't like to be disturbed."" 

I was assigned to the master suite. The room was enormous, with a stunning view of the city. But I wasn't interested in the view. I was interested in the life they had built here. On the bedside table was a silver frame. It held a picture of Ivan and Kiera on their wedding day. They weren't officially married, of course-Ivan was engaged to me. This was a lie within a lie, a ceremony just for them, a fantasy they lived out in secret.

I moved through the house, cleaning mechanically, my eyes scanning everything. The walls were covered in family portraits. Leo on a pony. Kiera and Ivan laughing on a boat. My father, Richard Donovan, a renowned architect, had designed this house. My mother, Eleanor Donovan, a high-society philanthropist, had decorated it. Her signature taste was everywhere.

I found Maria in the kitchen, wiping down the counters. I kept my voice low and disguised. ""It's a beautiful home. They seem like a very happy family."" 

Maria sighed, not looking at me. ""They are. Mr. Hughes adores that boy. And Mr. Donovan... he's here more than he's at his own home. Taught little Leo how to draw. Says the boy has his talent."" 

The words were a physical blow. My father had never offered to teach me anything. I had begged him to teach me calligraphy, his passion, but he always said he was too busy. He wasn't too busy for Leo.

""And Mrs. Donovan?"" I asked, my voice tight.

""Oh, she spoils Kiera rotten,"" Maria said, shaking her head. ""Brings her new jewelry every week. Says Kiera is the daughter she always wanted, so spirited and strong."" 

The daughter she always wanted. Not me. Not the real daughter who had spent years dreaming of a mother's love.

My stomach churned. I had to get out of there. As I turned to leave the kitchen, I heard the sound of a car in the driveway. A sleek black sedan. Ivan's car.

""They're home early!"" Maria hissed, her eyes wide with panic. ""Quick, hide! In the pantry! They can't see you here after hours."" 

She shoved me into the dark, narrow pantry just as the back door opened. I pressed myself against the shelves, my heart pounding against my ribs. Through the slatted door, I could see them. Ivan, Kiera, and Leo.

Leo was crying. ""But I wanted the blue one!"" 

""I know, sweetie, I know,"" Kiera cooed, st**king his hair. ""Daddy will get you the blue one tomorrow, won't you, Daddy?"" 

""Of course,"" Ivan said. He knelt down and looked at Kiera, his face etched with concern. ""Are you okay, though? You looked pale at the store."" 

""I'm fine,"" Kiera said, but her voice was weary. ""Just tired. It's hard, Ivan. Pretending all the time. Waiting for you to finally get rid of her."" 

My breath caught in my throat.

Ivan stood up and pulled Kiera into his arms. He ki**ed her forehead. ""I know, my love. I know it's not fair to you. But we have to be careful. Just a little longer. Once the new merger is complete, I won't need her family's connections anymore. I'll end it. I promise. Then we can be a real family, out in the open."" 

""You promise?"" she whispered.

""I promise,"" he said, his voice a low, in**mate vow. ""You and Leo are my entire world. Aliana... she's just a means to an end. A placeholder."" 

A placeholder.

The word echoed in the silent pantry. That's all I was. A tool he was using. A temporary fix until he got what he wanted. The love, the engagement, our entire life together-it was a business transaction.

I squeezed my eyes shut, fighting the bile that rose in my throat. I had all the proof I needed. I had the photos, the bank statements, and now, the raw, undeniable truth from his own lips.

I waited until they moved into the living room, their laughter echoing down the hall. I slipped out of the pantry, nodded a silent thank you to a terrified-looking Maria, and walked out the service door without a backward glance.

As I was rounding the corner of the house, heading for the street, Kiera stepped out onto the patio for a phone call. She saw me. Her eyes narrowed, a flicker of recognition in them even with my disguise. She didn't know who I was, but she knew I didn't belong.

""Hey, you!"" she called out. ""What are you still doing here?"" 

I didn't answer. I just picked up my pace, my heart hammering. I couldn't let her see my face. Not yet. The game wasn't over. It had just begun.


Chapter 4
Kiera's suspicion was a dangerous spark. I couldn't risk another close call. The next morning, Maria called me on my burner phone, her voice trembling.

""Mrs. Reese was asking about the new girl. She said you looked familiar. I told her you were my cousin, just filling in for the day. I think she believed me, but she's watching everyone now."" 

""You did well, Maria,"" I said, my voice calm. ""Here's what you do now. Quit. I've deposited a year's salary into your account. Disappear for a while."" 

There was a choked sob on the other end of the line. ""Thank you. God bless you."" 

The line went dead. One loose end tied up. Now for the rest.

I called my best friend, Debi Frost. She wasn't just my friend; she was a shark of a lawyer, the sharpest mind I knew. We met at a noisy downtown coffee shop, a place where no one would notice us.

I laid it all out. The secret house, the child, the five-year lie. I slid the flash drive across the table. Her face, usually so animated, became a mask of cold fury as she listened.

""Those ba**ards,"" she breathed, her knuckles white as she gripped her coffee cup. ""All of them. Your parents, too. Aliana, we are going to destroy them."" 

""I don't want to destroy them, Debi,"" I said quietly. ""I just want to disappear. I want to leave them behind with the truth of what they've done."" 

""Leave? Aliana, you're entitled to half of Ivan's assets, not to mention a massive settlement from your parents for the emotional distress..."" 

""I don't want their money,"" I said, the words tasting like ash. ""Their money is what they used to buy my silence, my compliance. It's tainted. I want nothing from them."" 

Debi studied my face, then nodded slowly. ""Okay. If that's what you want. A clean break. We can do that. We'll prepare the divorce papers, cite infidelity. And a document renouncing any claim to the Donovan family inheritance. We'll make it airtight."" 

As we were planning, my phone buzzed. It was an email from my mother's assistant about the ""anniversary"" dinner Ivan had proposed. The location was set: a private room at The Oak Room, the same restaurant where Ivan and I had our first date. The irony was so thick it was suffocating.

But it was a detail at the bottom of the email that made my bl**d run cold. Debi saw my expression and leaned closer. ""What is it?"" 

I read it aloud, my voice barely a wh**per. ""Please confirm Dr. Donovan's dietary restrictions. The chef notes her mild allergy to benzodiazepines from her hospital records."" 

Debi's eyes widened in horror. ""Benzos? They're going to d**g you?"" 

It clicked into place. The dinner wasn't a celebration. It was a trap. They were afraid that on the anniversary of their great deception, I might finally get emotional, or suspicious. They were going to sedate me, just to make sure their evening went smoothly, to ensure the placeholder didn't cause a scene.

The last flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, there was some twisted, misguided love behind their actions died. This was pure, calculated cruelty.

I started to laugh. It was a hollow, broken sound that had nothing to do with humor. ""Of course,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Of course, they would."" 

Debi reached across the table and grabbed my hand. Her grip was firm, grounding. ""Aliana, you can't go."" 

""Oh, I'm going,"" I said, my eyes hard. ""I'm going to let them think their plan is working perfectly. And then, I'm going to vanish."" 

That afternoon, in Debi's office, I signed the papers. The divorce petition. The legal renunciation of the Donovan name and fortune. With each st**ke of the pen, I felt a chain breaking. I was cutting myself free.

I went online and booked a one-way ticket to a small, coastal town in Oregon under a new name, a name I hadn't used since I was a child in the system, before they found me. A name that was truly mine. The flight was for Saturday night, the night of Leo's fifth birthday party. The party I wasn't invited to. The party that would serve as my grand finale.

When I got back to the apartment, Ivan was there, humming as he packed an overnight bag.

""Just a quick business trip,"" he said, not meeting my eyes. ""Have to fly out tonight, back tomorrow afternoon. Just in time for our dinner."" 

I knew where he was going. He was going to Kiera's. To his son's birthday eve.

""Be safe,"" I said, my voice soft.

He ki**ed me, a quick, dismissive peck on the cheek. ""I love you,"" he said.

""I know,"" I replied, the words a hollow echo.

That night, I lay alone in our bed, the sheets cold beside me. For the first time in five years, the loneliness didn't hurt. It felt like freedom. I was no longer Aliana Donovan, the long-lost daughter, the happy fianc√©e. I was a ghost in my own life, counting down the hours until I could finally disappear.


Chapter 5
The night of the dinner arrived. The night of my departure. My mother, Eleanor, fussed over my dress, her smile painted on.

""You look beautiful, darling. So elegant."" 

My father, Richard, stood by, looking proud. ""Ready for our special night?"" 

They were actors giving the performance of their lives. I was the audience of one, and I knew the whole script.

We sat in the private room at The Oak Room. The air was thick with unspoken words. My mother placed a small bowl of soup in front of me. ""The chef made his specialty just for you. A creamy mushroom bisque."" 

I could smell it. The faint, almost undetectable almond scent of the benzodiazepine mixed in. They didn't even try to be creative. They were arrogant.

""Thank you, Mother,"" I said, picking up my spoon. I looked at her, then at my father. ""It means so much that you're all here. That we can finally put the past behind us."" 

Their faces softened with relief. I was playing my part perfectly. I took a spoonful of the soup. Then another. I ate half the bowl, my stomach clenching with each swallow, not from the d**g, but from the betrayal.

After a few minutes, I pressed a hand to my forehead. ""I'm feeling a little... dizzy. I think the shift at the hospital finally caught up with me."" 

""Oh, you poor thing,"" Eleanor said, her concern a masterpiece of fiction. ""Of course. You should rest."" 

""Would you mind if I just... went to the powder room for a moment?"" I asked, my voice intentionally weak.

""Go, go,"" Richard urged. ""We'll be right here."" 

I gave them one last look. My parents. The people who were supposed to love me unconditionally.

""Were you ever sorry?"" I asked, the question slipping out before I could stop it. ""For what happened to me? For all the years I was gone?"" 

They stared at me, their smiles faltering. There was a flicker of something in their eyes-guilt, maybe-but it was quickly extinguished.

""Of course, we were, Aliana,"" my father said, his voice a little too firm. ""Every single day."" 

A lie. Another one. I didn't press. I just nodded. ""I'm glad."" 

I walked toward the back of the restaurant, my steps steady. Once inside the empty, opulent bathroom, I locked the door, knelt before the toilet, and forced myself to throw up, my body convulsing until the soup and the poison were gone. I rinsed my mouth, my face pale but my eyes clear in the mirror.

The dizziness was an act, but the nausea was real.

When I returned to the apartment I had once shared with Ivan, he was waiting. He was dressed for the party, Kiera's party, his face glowing with anticipation. He held out a glass of champagne.

""A toast,"" he said, smiling. ""To us. To our future."" 

I saw the fine powder lingering at the bottom of my glass. A second dose. They were making sure.

I played the part of the smitten fianc√©e one last time. ""To us,"" I echoed, my voice light and airy. I let him think I was dizzy from the dinner, leaning on him slightly.

""I have to go to the hospital for a bit,"" he said, the lie rolling off his tongue with practiced ease. ""An emergency consult. I'll be back as late as I can."" 

""Don't worry about me,"" I said. I took the glass of champagne and, looking him directly in the eye, drank it all down in one go. His smile widened. He thought he had won.

""I'll see you later,"" he said, giving me a quick k**s. He walked out the door without a second glance. He never looked back.

The moment he was gone, I ran to the bathroom and purged the champagne, my body shaking with the effort. When I was done, I felt strangely calm. Cleansed.

I changed into simple, dark clothing. I walked into the living room, where a single, elegantly wrapped gift box sat on the coffee table. I had prepared it that afternoon.

I called the butler from the Donovan estate, a man who had shown me small kindnesses over the years. ""James,"" I said. ""I have a package that needs to be delivered to the party at 10 p.m. precisely. Not before, not after. Can you do that for me?"" 

""Of course, Dr. Donovan,"" he said, his voice steady.

Inside the box was the flash drive, a small portable speaker, and a single, handwritten card.

My final stop was a quiet street overlooking the secret mansion. The party was in full swing. I could see them all through the windows-Ivan, Kiera, Leo, my parents-laughing, celebrating a life built on my pain. They looked so happy.

My phone buzzed. A message from Debi. ""Wheels up in 30. You're free."" 

I looked at the scene one last time, a tableau of their perfect, fake happiness. I felt nothing. No anger, no sadness. Just a profound, empty peace.

I dropped my phone into a storm drain, the screen shattering on the concrete below. I had already canceled the number, wiped the data.

I don't have have a gym membership either, and those jogging outside already have companions or does not want to be bothered. So you see how difficult it is to make new friends.

Maybe I really have no choice but to go back to taking vices just to make friends again. That's why I decided to post here, if anyone's interested in having random dinners around Makati or BGC. I can only do that since I'm a regular salary person with a 9 to 5.

Well, 4 months into the relationship she admitted that she was in pain all this time. That's why she always wanted to do things in his house and not mine, why her libido was so low, why she was emotional, why she doesn't wants to do, you know, boyfriend's stuff. And we decided for the good of both of us to end the relationship.


I'm also suffering from depression and I take psychiatrist meds so, yeah, the break up really fucked me up. One month into a new job and I had to take a 30 day rest ordered by my psychiatrist. I'm now on so much drugs that all the boxes I have could kill a man. SSRIS, Antipsychotics, sleeping pills, you name it.

I know that it was only a 4 month relationship, but it really destroys me that she is in so much pain, that she could die in any moment bc of her illness.

She is beautiful god damn it. Light blue eyes, skinny and voluptuous body. 

I still love her, and today I saw that she unfollowed me on IG when 5 days ago we were chatting about taking a coffee, because we ended in good terms.

1mu8lhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/aquarius/comments/1mu8lhu/about_my_aquarius_coffee_girl_crush_can_you_guys/,About my Aquarius coffee girl crush. Can you guys help read this situation and give me your honest thoughts? I‚Äôm not sensitive! I want the truth. Thank you :),"So I‚Äôm also Aquarius, (M) I posted something about asking her out and finding her on insta last week which I deleted‚Ä¶but there‚Äôs a girl that works at the coffee shop I get my coffee from most mornings, I wasn‚Äôt going to ask her out at all at first, but then the following 2 times she went out of her way to come and talk to me and I started to like her. 

So I asked for her name last Saturday (a week ago) and decided next time I saw her I was going to ask her out. I went in Sunday-Friday following that and it just didn‚Äôt line up to ask her to hangout. So Friday afternoon, I just requested to follow her since going 6 days in a row in the drive through to get coffee and not being able to ask her in person. (Just didn‚Äôt line up) I was convinced I just got lucky the first 3 times and it could be awhile. 

Then Saturday comes, guess who brings me out my coffee!? So I ask her if she wants to hangout! She says yes and then asks me if I requested to follow her yesterday üòÖ I said yes, that I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was even giving to ask her to hangout and then last time I saw her, I decided I was going to ask and then it just never lined up so I thought I‚Äôd request to follow her and I didn‚Äôt want her to think I was stalking her and that was the second name to pop up. Which was true. She says she doesn‚Äôt think I was and I just expressed I was relieved and then ended the conversation‚Ä¶.I was excited and forgot to ask for her number ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

‚Ä¶she didn‚Äôt accept my follow request, I sent a message that never got seen on Saturday, yesterday late morning I just canceled the request because I figured she‚Äôs had a full day, 2 days if you include before I asked to hangout. 

Then I‚Äôm with my cousin this morning, I told him to stop at the coffee place, as we pull in, I see her in the walk up window, we get our order and we pull around and I don‚Äôt see her üòÖ I‚Äôm oblivious to wtf is going on and I‚Äôm looking from the passenger side into the building to see where she went, I gave up in about 5 seconds, I stopped looking behind the people in the front of the window and see 3 girls all whispering to each other, smiling and 2 of them looking at me. So I just gave a 1/2 smile when I made eye contact and we left‚Ä¶I‚Äôm like 99% sure she told them and they knew I was glancing back there to see where she was. Even if they didn‚Äôt notice that‚Ä¶would that be a good sign? I go there all the time and Ive never had an experience like that until I asked the girl to hangout‚Ä¶aside from being asked for my number a couple times over the course of 3-4 years. Usually it‚Äôs normal. 

I‚Äôm an Aquarius and I‚Äôm thinking  ‚Äúwhat would I do and how would I react?‚Äù And I have no idea. I‚Äôm overthinking it tbh. I wish I didn‚Äôt explain the insta thing and just said yes and asked for her number üòÖ that‚Äôs normally what I would do too! I‚Äôve seen this girl A-LOT of times and never once did I think about her after I got my coffee until this last week. Every time she speaks, I‚Äôm more intrigued and now that I‚Äôve looked at her as someone to potentially date in the future, I think she‚Äôs SO PRETTY. 

I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm infatuated with getting to know her. But I‚Äôve also come to terms that although she said yes, I over explained myself after the fact and forgot to ask for her number. So she might be out now üòÇ live and learn I guess if that‚Äôs the case.

I (30 F) started Ritalin about a month ago. I have been going through the motions of figuring out what dose is right for me, and I found out the hard way that your cycle can mess with the effectiveness.

I ended up at about 25mg per dose for about 1.5 weeks. I'm going back to 10mg to see where my proper dose should be, but I'm finding that the lower doses now feel different from a month ago. (a lot more anxiety and too much coffee feeling).

I am unsure if this is a side effect of the higher dose or if this just means I haven't reached the dose for me yet.

It is highly possible that I have experienced no anxiety and now am more aware of it.

I was just wondering if I should be worried or more patient with the process. ",1,1755577454.0,ausadhd,3,1.0,False

1mu8ikg,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mu8ikg/wake_story_by_lisa_mcmann_free_read_online/,Wake Story by Lisa McMann Free Read online,"¬†Janie Hannagan‚Äôs math book slips from her fingers. She grips the edge of the table in the school library. Everything goes black and silent. She sighs and rests her head on the table. Tries to pull herself out of it, but fails miserably. She‚Äôs too tired today. Too hungry. She really doesn‚Äôt have time for this.  
  
¬† And then.  
  
¬† She‚Äôs sitting in the bleachers in the football stadium, blinking under the lights, silent among the roars of the crowd.  
  
¬† She glances at the people sitting in the bleachers around her‚Äîfellow classmates, parents‚Äîtrying to spot the dreamer. She can tell this dreamer is afraid, but where is he? Then she looks to the football field. Finds him. Rolls her eyes.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs Luke Drake. No question about it. He is, after all, the only naked player on the field for the homecoming game.  
  
¬† Nobody seems to notice or care. Except him. The ball is snapped and the lines collide, but Luke is covering himself with his hands, hopping from one foot to the other. She can feel his panic increasing. Janie‚Äôs fingers tingle and go numb.  
  
¬† Luke looks over at Janie, eyes pleading, as the football moves toward him, a bullet in slow motion. ‚ÄúHelp,‚Äù he says.  
  
¬† She thinks about helping him. Wonders what it would take to change the course of Luke‚Äôs dream. She even considers that a boost of confidence to the star receiver the day before the big game could put Fieldridge High in the running for the Regional Class A Championship.  
  
¬† But Luke‚Äôs really a jerk. He won‚Äôt appreciate it. So she resigns herself to watching the debacle. She wonders if he‚Äôll choose pride or glory.  
  
¬† He‚Äôs not as big as he thinks he is.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs for damn sure.  
  
¬† The football nearly reaches Luke when the dream starts over again. Oh, get ON with it already, Janie thinks. She concentrates in her seat on the bleachers and slowly manages to stand. She tries to walk back under the bleachers for the rest of the dream so she doesn‚Äôt have to watch, and surprisingly, this time, she is able.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs a bonus.  
  
¬† 1:01 p.m.  
  
¬† Janie‚Äôs mind catapults back inside her body, still sitting at her usual remote corner table in the library. She flexes her fingers painfully, lifts her head and, when her sight returns, she scours the library.  
  
¬† She spies the culprit at a table about fifteen feet away. He‚Äôs awake now. Rubbing his eyes and grinning sheepishly at the two other football players who stand around him, laughing. Shoving him. Whapping him on the head.  
  
¬† Janie shakes her head to clear it and she lifts up her math book, which sits open and facedown on the table where she dropped it. Under it, she finds a fun-size Snickers bar. She smiles to herself and peers to the left, between rows of bookshelves.  
  
¬† But no one is there for her to thank.  
  
¬† WHERE IT BEGINS  
  
¬† Evening, December 23, 1996  
  
¬† Janie Hannagan is eight. She wears a thin, faded red-print dress with too-short sleeves, off-white tights that sag between her thighs, gray moon boots, and a brown, nappy coat with two missing buttons. Her long, dirty-blond hair stands up with static. She rides on an Amtrak train with her mother from their home in Fieldridge, Michigan, to Chicago to visit her grandmother. Mother reads the Globe across from her. There is a picture on the cover of an enormous man wearing a powder-blue tuxedo. Janie rests her head against the window, watching her breath make a cloud on it.  
  
¬† The cloud blurs Janie‚Äôs vision so slowly that she doesn‚Äôt realize what is happening. She floats in the fog for a moment, and then she is in a large room, sitting at a conference table with five men and three women. At the front of the room is a tall, balding man with a briefcase. He stands in his underwear, giving a presentation, and he is flustered. He tries to speak but he can‚Äôt get his mouth around the words. The other adults are all wearing crisp suits. They laugh and point at the bald man in his underwear.  
  
¬† The bald man looks at Janie.  
  
¬† And then he looks at the people who are laughing at him.  
  
¬† His face crumples in defeat.  
  
¬† He holds his briefcase in front of his privates, and that makes the others laugh harder. He runs to the door of the conference room, but the handle is slippery‚Äîsomething slimy drips from it. He can‚Äôt get it open; it squeaks and rattles loudly in his hand, and the people at the table double over. The man‚Äôs underwear is grayish-white, sagging. He turns to Janie again, with a look of panic and pleading.  
  
¬† Janie doesn‚Äôt know what to do.  
  
¬† She freezes.  
  
¬† The train‚Äôs brakes whine.  
  
¬† And the scene grows cloudy and is lost in fog.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJanie!‚Äù Janie‚Äôs mother is leaning toward Janie. Her breath smells like gin, and her straggly hair falls over one eye. ‚ÄúJanie, I said, maybe Grandma will take you to that big fancy doll store. I thought you would be excited about that, but I guess not.‚Äù Janie‚Äôs mother sips from a flask in her ratty old purse.  
  
¬† Janie focuses on her mother and smiles. ‚ÄúThat sounds fun,‚Äù she says, even though she doesn‚Äôt like dolls. She would rather have new tights. She wriggles on the seat, trying to adjust them. The crotch stretches tight at mid-thigh. She thinks about the bald man and scrunches her eyes. Weird.  
  
¬† When the train stops, they take their bags and step into the aisle. In front of Janie‚Äôs mother, a disheveled, bald businessman emerges from his compartment.  
  
¬† He wipes his face with a handkerchief.  
  
¬† Janie stares at him.  
  
¬† Her jaw drops. ‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù she whispers.  
  
¬† The man gives her a bland look when he sees her staring, and turns to exit the train.  
  
¬† September 6, 1999, 3:05 p.m.  
  
¬† Janie sprints to catch the bus after her first day of sixth grade. Melinda Jeffers, one of the Fieldridge North Side girls, sticks her foot out, sending Janie sprawling across the gravel. Melinda laughs all the way to her mother‚Äôs shiny red Jeep Cherokee. Janie fights back the urge to cry, and dusts herself off. She climbs on the bus, flops into the front seat, and looks at the dirt and blood on the palms of her hands, and the rip in the knee of her already well-worn pants.  
  
¬† Sixth grade makes her throat hurt.¬†/>  
¬† She leans her head against the window.  
  
¬† When she gets home, Janie walks past her mother, who is on the couch watching Guiding Light and drinking from a clear glass bottle. Janie washes her stinging hands carefully, dries them, and sits down next to her mother, hoping she‚Äôll notice. Hoping she‚Äôll say something.  
  
¬† But Janie‚Äôs mother is asleep now.  
  
¬† Her mouth is open.  
  
¬† She snores lightly.  
  
¬† The bottle tips in her hand.  
  
¬† Janie sighs, sets the bottle on the beat-up coffee table, and starts her homework.  
  
¬† Halfway through her math homework, the room turns black.  
  
¬† Janie is rushed into a bright tunnel, like a multicolored kaleidoscope. There‚Äôs no floor, and Janie is floating while the walls spin around her. It makes her feel like throwing up.  
  
¬† Next to Janie in the tunnel is her mother, and a man who looks like a blond Jesus Christ. The man and Janie‚Äôs mother are holding hands and flying. They look happy. Janie yells, but no sound comes out. She wants it to stop.  
  
¬† She feels the pencil fall from her fingers.  
  
¬† Feels her body slump to the arm of the couch.  
  
¬† Tries to sit up, but with all the whirling colors around her, she can‚Äôt tell which way is upright. She overcompensates and falls the other way, onto her mother.  
  
¬† The colors stop, and everything goes black.  
  
¬† Janie hears her mother grumbling.  
  
¬† Feels her shove.  
  
¬† Slowly the room comes into focus again, and Janie‚Äôs mother slaps Janie in the face.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGet offa me,‚Äù her mother says. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with you?‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie sits up and looks at her mother. Her stomach churns, and she feels dizzy from the colors. ‚ÄúI feel sick,‚Äù she whispers, and then she stands up and stumbles to the bathroom to vomit.  
  
¬† When she peers out, pale and shaky, her mother is gone from the couch, retired to her bedroom.  
  
¬† Thank God, Janie thinks. She splashes cold water on her face.  
  
¬† January 1, 2001, 7:29 a.m.  
  
¬† A U-Haul truck pulls up next door. A man, a woman, and a girl Janie‚Äôs age climb out and sink into the snow-covered driveway. Janie watches them from her bedroom window.  
  
¬† The girl is dark-haired and pretty.  
  
¬† Janie wonders if she‚Äôll be snooty, like all the other girls who call Janie white trash at school. Maybe, since this new girl lives next to Janie on the wrong side of town, they‚Äôll call her white trash too.  
  
¬† But she‚Äôs really pretty.  
  
¬† Pretty enough to make a difference.  
  
¬† Janie dresses hurriedly, puts on her boots and coat, and marches next door to have the first chance to get to the girl before the North Siders get to her. Janie‚Äôs desperate for a friend.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou guys want some help?‚Äù Janie asks in a voice more confident than she feels.  
  
¬† The girl stops in her tracks. A smile deepens the dimples in her cheeks, and she tilts her head to the side. ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Carrie Brandt.‚Äù  
  
¬† Carrie‚Äôs eyes sparkle.  
  
¬† Janie‚Äôs heart leaps.  
  
¬† March 2, 2001, 7:34 p.m.  
  
¬† Janie is thirteen.  
  
¬† She doesn‚Äôt have a sleeping bag, but Carrie has an extra that Janie can use. Janie sets her plastic grocery bag on the floor by the couch in Carrie‚Äôs living room.  
  
¬† Inside the bag:  
  
¬† a hand-made birthday gift for Carrie  
  
¬† Janie‚Äôs pajamas  
  
¬† a toothbrush  
  
¬† She‚Äôs nervous. But Carrie is chattering enough for both of them, waiting for Carrie‚Äôs other new friend, Melinda Jeffers, to show up.  
  
¬† Yes, that Melinda Jeffers.  
  
¬† Of the Fieldridge North Side Jefferses.  
  
¬† Apparently, Melinda Jeffers is also the president of the ‚ÄúMake Janie Hannagan Miserable‚Äù Club. Janie wipes her sweating hands on her jeans.  
  
¬† When Melinda arrives, Carrie doesn‚Äôt fawn over her. Janie nods hello.  
  
¬† Melinda smirks. Tries to whisper something to Carrie, but Carrie ignores her and says, ‚ÄúHey! Let‚Äôs do Janie‚Äôs hair.‚Äù  
  
¬† Melinda throws a daggered look at Carrie.  
  
¬† Carrie smiles brightly at Janie, asking her with her eyes if it‚Äôs okay.  
  
¬† Janie squelches a grin, and Melinda shrugs and pretends like she doesn‚Äôt mind after all.  
  
¬† Even though Janie knows it‚Äôs killing her.  
  
¬† The three girls slowly grow more comfortable, or maybe just resigned, with one another. They put on makeup and watch Carrie‚Äôs favorite videos of old comedians, some of whom Janie‚Äôs never heard of before. And then they play truth or dare.  
  
¬† Carrie alternates: truth, dare, truth, dare.  
  
¬† Melinda always picks truth.  
  
¬† And then there‚Äôs Janie.  
  
¬† Janie never picks truth.  
  
¬† She‚Äôs a dare girl.  
  
¬† That way, nobody gets inside.  
  
¬† She can‚Äôt afford to let anyone inside.  
  
¬† They might find out about her secret.  
  
¬† The giggles become hysterics when Melinda‚Äôs dare for Janie is to run outside through the snow barefoot, around to the backyard, take off her clothes, and make a naked snow angel.  
  
¬† Janie doesn‚Äôt have a problem doing that.  
  
¬† Because, really, what does she have to lose?  
  
¬† She‚Äôll take that dare over giving up her secrets any day.  
  
¬† Melinda watches Janie, arms folded in the cold night air, and with a sneer on her face, while Carrie giggles and helps Janie get her sweatshirt and jeans back on her wet body. Carrie takes Janie‚Äôs bra, fills the cups with snow, and slingshots them like snowballs at Melinda.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEw, gross,‚Äù Melinda sneers. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you get that old grungy thing, Salvation Army?‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie‚Äôs giggles fade. She grabs her bra back from Carrie and shoves it in her jeans pocket, embarrassed. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she says hotly, then giggles again. ‚ÄúIt was Goodwill. Why, does it look familiar?‚Äù  
  
¬† Carrie snorts.  
  
¬† Even Melinda laughs, reluctantly.  
  
¬† They trudge back inside for popcorn.  
  
¬† 11:34 p.m.  
  
¬† The noise level in the living room of Carrie‚Äôs house fades along with the lights after Mr. Brandt, Carrie‚Äôs father, stomps to the doorway and hollers at the three girls to shut up and get to sleep.  
  
¬† Janie zips up the musty-smelling sleeping bag and closes her eyes, but she is too hyper to sleep after that exhilarating naked snow angel. She had a fun evening despite Melinda. She learned what it‚Äôs like to be a rich girl (sounds nice for about a day, but too many stinking lessons), and that Luke Drake is supposedly the hottest boy in the class (in Carrie‚Äôs mind), and what people like Melinda do four times a year (they take vacations to exotic places). Who knew?  
  
¬† Now the hushed giggles subside around her, and Janie opens her eyes to stare at the dark ceiling. She is glad to be here, even though Melinda teases her about her clothes. Melinda even had the nerve to ask Janie why she never wears anything new. But Carrie shut her up with a sudden exclamation: ‚ÄúJanie, you look simply stunning with your hair back like that. Doesn‚Äôt she, Melinda?‚Äù  
  
¬† For the first time ever, Janie‚Äôs hair is in French braids, and now, lying in the sleeping bag, she feels the bumps pressing against her scalp through the thin pillow. Maybe Carrie could teach her how to do it sometime.  
  
¬† She has to pee, but she is afraid to get up, in case Carrie‚Äôs father hears her and starts yelling again. She rests quietly like the other girls, listening to them breathe as they drift off to sleep. Melinda is in the middle, curled on her side facing Carrie, her back to Janie.  
  
¬† 12:14 a.m.  
  
¬† The ceiling clouds over and disappears. Janie blinks and she is at school, in civics class. She looks around and realizes she is not in her normal fourth-period class, but in the class that follows hers. She stands at the back of the room. There are no empty seats. Ms. Parchelli, the teacher, drones about the judicial branch of government and what the Supreme Court justices wear under their robes. No one seems surprised that Ms. Parchelli is teaching them this. Some of the kids take notes.  
  
¬† Janie looks around at the faces in the room. In the third row, seated a  
t the center desk, is Melinda. Melinda has a dreamy look on her face. She is staring at someone in the next row, one seat forward. As the teacher talks, Melinda stands up slowly and approaches the person she‚Äôs been staring at. From the back of the room, Janie cannot see who it is.  
  
¬† The teacher doesn‚Äôt appear to notice. Melinda kneels next to the desk and touches the person‚Äôs hand. In slow motion, the person turns to Melinda, touches her cheek, and then leans forward. The two of them kiss. After a moment, they both rise to their feet, still kissing. When they part, Janie can see the face of Melinda‚Äôs kissing partner. Melinda leads her partner by the hand to the front of the room and opens the door of the supply closet. The bell rings, and like ants, the students crowd at the door to leave.  
  
¬† The ceiling in Carrie Brandt‚Äôs living room reappears as Melinda sighs and flops onto her stomach in the sleeping bag next to Janie. Cripes! thinks Janie. She looks at the clock. It‚Äôs 1:23 a.m.  
  
¬† 1:24 a.m.  
  
¬† Janie rolls to her side and she‚Äôs walking into a forest. It‚Äôs dark from shade, not night. A few rays of weak sunlight slip through the tree cover. Walking in front of Janie is Carrie. They walk for what seems to be a mile or more, and suddenly a rushing river appears a few steps in front of them. Carrie stops and cups her ear, listening for something. She calls out in a desperate voice, ‚ÄúCarson!‚Äù Over and over, Carrie calls the name, until the forest rings with her voice. Carrie walks along the high bank and stumbles over a tree root. Janie bumps into her, falls, and then Carrie helps her up. She gives Janie a puzzled look and says, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never been here.‚Äù Carrie turns back to her search for Carson, her cries growing louder.  
  
¬† There is a splash in the river, and a little boy appears above the surface, bobbing and moving swiftly in the current. Carrie runs along the bank and cries, ‚ÄúCarson! Get out of there! Carson!‚Äù  
  
¬† The boy grins and chokes on the water. He goes under and resurfaces. Carrie is frantic. She reaches out her hand to the boy, but it makes no difference‚Äîthe bank is too high, the river too wide for her to come close to reaching him. She is crying now.

¬†Janie watches, her heart pounding. The boy is still grinning and choking, falling under the water. He is drowning.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHelp him!‚Äù screams Carrie. ‚ÄúSave him!‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie leaps toward the boy in the water, but she lands on the bank in the same spot she took off from. She tries again as Carrie screams, but the results are the same.  
  
¬† The boy‚Äôs eyes are closed now. His grin has turned eerie. From the water behind the boy, an enormous shark bursts above the surface, mouth open, hundreds of sharp teeth gleaming. It closes its mouth around the boy and disappears.  
  
¬† Carrie sits up in her sleeping bag and screams.  
  
¬† Janie screams too, but it catches in her throat.  
  
¬† Her voice is hoarse.  
  
¬† Her fingers are numb.  
  
¬† Her body shakes from the nightmare.  
  
¬† The two girls look at each other in the darkness, while Melinda stirs, groans, and goes back to sleep. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù Janie whispers, sitting up.  
  
¬† Carrie nods, breathing hard. She whisper-laughs, embarrassed. Her voice shakes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I woke you. Bad dream.‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie hesitates. ‚ÄúYou want to talk about it?‚Äù Her mind is racing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNah. Go back to sleep.‚Äù Carrie rolls to her side. Melinda stirs, rolls a few inches closer to Carrie, and is quiet again.  
  
¬† Janie glances at the clock. 3:42 a.m. She is exhausted. She drifts off to sleep. . . .  
  
¬† 3:51 a.m.  
  
¬† . . . she is jolted awake when she falls into a huge, beautiful bedroom. There are framed posters of \*NSYNC and Sheryl Crow on the walls. At a desk sits Melinda, doodling on the edge of her notebook. Janie tries to blink herself out of the room. She feels herself sit up in the sleeping bag, but her motions don‚Äôt affect what she sees. She lies back down, resigned to watch.  
  
¬† Melinda is drawing hearts. Janie walks toward her. She says, ‚ÄúMelinda,‚Äù but no sound comes out. When someone knocks on the bedroom window, Melinda looks over and smiles. ‚ÄúHelp me open this window, will you?‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie stares at Melinda. Melinda stares back, then points to the window with a jerk of her head. Janie, feeling compelled, stumbles over to the window next to Melinda and they open it. Carrie climbs in.  
  
¬† She is naked from the waist up.  
  
¬† And has breasts the size of watermelons.  
  
¬† The breasts sway from side to side when Carrie scrambles over the sill.  
  
¬† She walks through Janie and stands shyly in front of Melinda.  
  
¬† Janie tries to turn away, but she can‚Äôt. She waves a hand in front of Carrie‚Äôs face, but Carrie doesn‚Äôt respond. Melinda winks at Janie and folds Carrie into her arms. They embrace and kiss. Janie rolls her eyes, and suddenly all three are back in Ms. Parchelli‚Äôs civics classroom. Once again, Melinda is embracing someone in the aisle. It‚Äôs Carrie. She leads Carrie to the front of the room. Janie can see that no one else in the class gives an ounce of notice to the naked Carrie and her enormous breasts.  
  
¬† Janie sits up in her sleeping bag again and shakes her head wildly. She feels the ends of her braids slap the sides of her cheeks, but she is unable to remove herself from the classroom. She is forced not only to be there, but also to watch.  
  
¬† Melinda glides to the supply closet and leads Carrie in there with her. Janie, against her wishes, follows. Melinda closes the door once Carrie and Janie are inside, and Melinda starts kissing Carrie on the lips again.  
  
¬† Janie lunges in her sleeping bag blindly.  
  
¬† Kicks Melinda, hard.  
  
¬† And Janie is back in Carrie‚Äôs living room.  
  
¬† Melinda sits up, hair disheveled, and scrambles around to look at Janie. ‚ÄúWhat the hell did you do that for?‚Äù Melinda is furious.  
  
¬† Feigning sleep, Janie peers out of one eye. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she mumbles. ‚ÄúThere was a spider crawling over your sleeping bag. I saved your life.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNever mind, he‚Äôs gone.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, great. Like I‚Äôm gonna get back to sleep now.‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie grins in the darkness. It‚Äôs 5:51 a.m.  
  
¬† 7:45 a.m.  
  
¬† Something nudges Janie‚Äôs legs. She opens her eyes, wondering where she is. It‚Äôs pitch dark. Carrie turns the sleeping bag flap off Janie‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúWake up, sleepyhead.‚Äù The sunlight is blinding.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMmph,‚Äù Janie grunts. Slowly she sits up.  
  
¬† Carrie is balancing on her haunches, eyeing her, one brow raised.  
  
¬† Janie remembers. Does Carrie?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you sleep well?‚Äù Carrie asks.  
  
¬† Janie‚Äôs stomach twists. ‚ÄúUm . . . yeah.‚Äù She gauges Carrie‚Äôs reaction. ‚ÄúDid you?‚Äù  
  
¬† Carrie smiles. ‚ÄúLike a baby. Even on this hard floor.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAh, hmm. Well, that‚Äôs great.‚Äù Janie scrambles to her feet and untwists from her nightgown. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Melinda?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe left about ten minutes ago. She was acting weird. Said she forgot she had a piano lesson at eight.‚Äù Carrie snorts. ‚ÄúDuh.‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie laughs weakly. She‚Äôs starving. The two girls fix breakfast. Carrie doesn‚Äôt appear to remember her nightmare.  
  
¬† Janie can‚Äôt forget it.  
  
¬† As they munch on toast, Janie steals a glance at Carrie‚Äôs chest. Her breasts are the size of half an apple, each.  
  
¬† Janie goes home, falls into bed, thinking about the strange night. Wondering if this ever happens to anyone else. Knowing, deep down, it probably doesn‚Äôt.  
  
¬† She falls into a hard sleep until late afternoon.  
  
¬† Decides sleepovers are not for her.  
  
¬† They‚Äôll never be for her.  
  
¬† June 7, 2004  
  
¬† Janie is sixteen. She buys her own clothing now. Often she buys food, too. The welfare check covers the rent and the booze, and not much else.  
  
¬† Two years ago, Janie started working a few hours after school and on the weekends at Heather Nursing Home. Now she works full-time for the summer.  
  
¬† The office staff and the other aides at Heather Home like Janie, especially during school holidays, because she‚Äôll pick up anybody‚Äôs shifts, day or night, so they can take a last-minute sick day or vacation. Janie needs the money, and they know it.  
  
¬† She‚Äôs determined to go to college.  
  
¬† Five days a week or more, Janie puts on her hospital scrubs and takes a bus to the nursing home. She likes old people. They don‚Äôt sleep soundly.  
  
¬† Janie and Carrie are still friends and next-door neighbors. They spend a lot of time at Janie‚Äôs house, waiting for Janie‚Äôs mother to pass out in her bedroom before they watch movies and talk about boys. They talk about other things too, like why Carrie‚Äôs father is so angry all the time, and why Carrie‚Äôs mother doesn‚Äôt like company. Mostly, Janie thinks, it‚Äôs just because they‚Äôre grouchy people. Plain and simple. Whenever Carrie asks if she can have Janie sleep over, her mother says, ‚ÄúYou just had a sleepover on your birthday.‚Äù Carrie doesn‚Äôt bother to remind her that that was four years ago.  
  
¬† Janie thinks about Carson and wonders if Carrie really is an only child. But Carrie doesn‚Äôt seem to talk about anything with sharp edges. Maybe she‚Äôs afraid they might poke into her and then she‚Äôd burst.  
  
¬† Carrie and Melinda are also still friends. Melinda‚Äôs parents are still rich. Melinda plays tennis. She is a cheerleader. Her parents have condos in Vegas, Marco Island, Vail, and somewhere in Greece. Melinda mostly hangs out with other rich kids. And then there‚Äôs Carrie.  
  
¬† Janie doesn‚Äôt mind being with Melinda. Melinda still can‚Äôt stand Janie. Janie thinks she knows the real reason why, and it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with having money.  
  
¬† June 25, 2004, 11:15 p.m.  
  
¬† After working a record eleven evenings straight, and being caught by old Mr. Reed‚Äôs recurring nightmare about World War II seven of those eleven evenings, Janie collapses on the couch and kicks her shoes off. By the number of empty bottles on the ring-stained coffee table, she assumes her mother is in her bedroom, down for the count.  
  
¬† Carrie lets herself in. ‚ÄúCan I crash here?‚Äù Her eyes are rimmed in red.  
  
¬† Janie sighs inwardly. She wants to sleep. ‚Äú ‚ÄôCourse. You okay with the couch?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure. Thanks.‚Äù  
  
¬†  
Janie relaxes. Carrie, on the couch, would work fine.  
  
¬† Carrie sniffles loudly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Janie asks, trying to put as much sympathy in her voice as she can muster. It‚Äôs enough.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDad‚Äôs yelling again. I got asked out. Dad says no.‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie perks up. ‚ÄúWho asked you out?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStu. From the body shop.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou mean that old guy?‚Äù  
  
¬† Carrie bristles. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs twenty-two.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sixteen! And he looks older than that.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot up close. He‚Äôs cute. He has a cute ass.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe he plays Dance Dance Revolution at the arcade.‚Äù  
  
¬† Carrie giggles. Janie smiles.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo. You got any liquor around here?‚Äù Carrie asks innocently.  
  
¬† Janie laughs. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an understatement. Whaddya want, beer?‚Äù She looks at the bottles on the table. ‚ÄúSchnapps? Whiskey? Double-stuff vodka?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGot any of that cheap grape wine the winos at Selby Park drink?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAt your service.‚Äù Janie hauls herself off the couch and looks for clean glasses. The kitchen is a mess. Janie has barely been here the past two weeks. She finds two sticky, mismatched glasses in the sink and washes them out, then searches through her mother‚Äôs stash for her cheap wine assortment. ‚ÄúAh, here it is. Boone‚Äôs Farm, right?‚Äù She unscrews the bottle and pours two glasses full, not waiting for an answer from Carrie, and then puts the bottle back in the fridge.  
  
¬† Carrie flips on the TV. She takes a glass from Janie. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie sips the sweet wine and makes a face. ‚ÄúSo what are you gonna do about Stu?‚Äù She thinks there‚Äôs a country song in that sentence somewhere.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGo out with him.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour dad‚Äôs gonna kill you if he finds out.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, well. What else is new?‚Äù They both settle on the creaky couch and put their feet on the coffee table, deftly pushing the mess of bottles to the center of it so they can stretch out.  
  
¬† The TV drones. The girls sip their wine and get silly. Janie gets up, rummages around in her bedroom, and returns with snacks.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGross‚Äîyou keep Doritos in your bedroom?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEmergency stash. For nights such as these.‚Äù Since Mother can‚Äôt be bothered to buy any actual food at the grocery store when she goes there for booze, Janie thinks.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAhh.‚Äù Carrie nods.  
  
¬† 12:30 a.m.  
  
¬† Janie is asleep on the couch. She doesn‚Äôt dream. Never dreams.  
  
¬† 5:02 a.m.  
  
¬† Janie, forced awake, catapults into Carrie‚Äôs dream. It‚Äôs the one by the river. Again. Janie‚Äôs been here twice since the first time, when they were thirteen.  
  
¬† Janie, blind to the room her physical body is in, tries to stand. If she can feel her way to her bedroom and close the door before she starts going numb, she might get enough distance to break the connection. She feels with her toes for the bottles on the floor, and goes around them. She reaches out for the wall and finds her way into the hallway as she and Carrie are walking through the forest in Carrie‚Äôs dream. Janie reaches for the door frames‚Äîfirst her mother‚Äôs bedroom (hush, don‚Äôt bump the door), then the bathroom, and then her room. She makes it inside, turns, and closes the door just as Carrie and Janie approach the riverbank.  
  
¬† The connection is lost.  
  
¬† Janie breathes a sigh of relief. She looks around, blinks in the dark as her eyesight returns, crawls into bed, and sleeps.  
  
¬† 9:06 a.m.  
  
¬† When she wakes, both her mother and Carrie are in the kitchen. The living room is cleared of bottles. Carrie is drying a sink full of dishes, and Janie‚Äôs mother is fixing her homemade morning drink: vodka and orange juice on ice. On the stove is a skillet covered by a paper plate. Two pieces of buttered toast, two eggs over easy, and a small fortune of crisp bacon rest on a second paper plate, next to the skillet. Janie‚Äôs mother picks up a piece of bacon, takes her drink, and disappears back into her bedroom without a word.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks Carrie‚Äîyou didn‚Äôt have to do this. I was planning on cleaning today.‚Äù  
  
¬† Carrie is cheerful. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the least I can do. Did you sleep well? When did you go to bed?‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie peeks in the skillet, thinking, discovering hash browns. ‚ÄúWow! Um . . . not long ago. It was close to daylight. But I was so tired.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been working ridiculous hours.‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie. ‚ÄúYeah, well. College. One day. How did you sleep?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPretty good . . . ‚Äù She hesitates, like she might say something else, but doesn‚Äôt.  
  
¬† Janie takes a bite of food. She‚Äôs famished. ‚ÄúDid you have sweet dreams?‚Äù  
  
¬† Carrie glances at Janie, then picks up another dish and wipes it with the towel. ‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie concentrates on the food, but her stomach flips. She waits, until the silence grows awkward. ‚ÄúYou want to talk about it?‚Äù  
  
¬† Carrie is silent for a long time. ‚ÄúNot really. No,‚Äù she says finally.  
  
¬† AND PICKS UP SPEED  
  
¬† August 30, 2004  
  
¬† It is the first day of school. Janie and Carrie are juniors. They wait for the bus on the corner of their street. A handful of other high school kids stand with them. Some are anxious. Some are terribly short. Janie and Carrie ignore the freshmen.  
  
¬† The bus is late. Luckily for Cabel Strumheller, the bus is later than he is. Janie and Carrie know Cabel‚Äîhe‚Äôs been trouble in school since ninth grade. Janie doesn‚Äôt remember him much before that‚Äîword was that he flunked down into their grade. He was often late. Always looked stoned. Now, he looks about six inches taller than he did in the spring. His blue-black hair hangs in greasy ringlets in front of his eyes, and he walks with shoulders curved, as if he were more comfortable being short. He stands away from everyone and smokes a cigarette.  
  
¬† Janie catches his eye by accident, so she nods hello. He looks down at the ground quickly. Blows smoke from his lips. Tosses the cigarette down and grinds it into the gravel.  
  
¬† Carrie pokes Janie in the ribs. ‚ÄúLookie, it‚Äôs your boyfriend.‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie rolls her eyes. ‚ÄúBe nice.‚Äù  
  
¬† Carrie observes him carefully while he‚Äôs not looking. ‚ÄúWell. His pox-face cleared up over the summer. Or maybe the new fancy ‚Äôdo hides it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop,‚Äù hisses Janie. She‚Äôs giggling, and feeling bad about it. But she‚Äôs looking at him. He‚Äôs got to be about as dirt poor as Janie, judging by his clothes. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a loner. And quiet.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA stoner, maybe, who has a boner for you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie narrows her eyes, and her face grows sober. ‚ÄúCarrie, stop it. I‚Äôm serious. You‚Äôre turning mean like Melinda.‚Äù Janie glances at Cabel. His jeans are too short. She knows what it‚Äôs like to be teased for not having cool clothes and stuff. She feels herself wanting to defend him. ‚ÄúHe probably has shitty welfare parents, like me.‚Äù  
  
¬† Carrie is quiet. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like Melinda.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo why do you hang with her?‚Äù  
  
¬† She shrugs and thinks about it for a minute. ‚ÄúI dunno. ‚ÄôCause she‚Äôs rich.‚Äù  
  
¬† Finally the bus comes. The ride is forty-five minutes to school, even though the school is less than five miles away, because of all the stops. Juniors like Janie and Carrie are considered by the unwritten bus rules to be upperclassmen. So they sit near the back. Cabel passes by and falls into the seat behind them. Janie can feel him push his knees up against her back. She peers through the crack between her seat back and the window. Cabel‚Äôs chin is propped up by his hand. His eyes are closed, nearly hidden beneath his greasy curls.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù Janie mutters under her breath.  
  
¬† Thankfully, Cabel Strumheller doesn‚Äôt dream.  
  
¬† Not on the bus, anyway.  
  
¬† Not in chemistry class, either.  
  
¬† Or English.  
  
¬† Nor does anyone else. Janie arrives home after the first day of school, relieved.  
  
¬† October 16, 2004, 7:42 p.m.  
  
¬† Carrie and Stu knock on Janie‚Äôs bedroom window. She opens it a crack. Stu‚Äôs dressed up, wearing a thin, black leather tie, and Carrie has on a slinky black dress with a shawl a  
nd a hideously large orchid pinned to it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI saw your light on in here,‚Äù explains Carrie, regarding the unusual visit. ‚ÄúCome to the homecoming dance, with us, Janers! We‚Äôre not staying long. Please?‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie sighs. ‚ÄúYou know I don‚Äôt have anything to wear.‚Äù  
  
¬† Carrie holds up a silver spaghetti-strap dress so Janie can see it. ‚ÄúHere‚ÄîI bet this‚Äôll fit you. I got it from Melinda. She‚Äôll die if she sees you in it instead of me. And I‚Äôve got shoes that‚Äôll go with it.‚Äù Carrie grins evilly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt washed my hair or anything.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou look fine, Janie,‚Äù Stu says. ‚ÄúCome on. Don‚Äôt make me sit there with a bunch of teenybopper airheads all night. Have pity on an old man.‚Äù  
  
¬† Janie smirks. Carrie slaps Stu on the arm.  
  
¬† She meets them at the front door, takes the dress, and heads over to Carrie‚Äôs ten minutes later.  
  
¬† 9:12 p.m.  
  
¬† Janie drinks her third cup of punch while Stu and Carrie dance for the billionth time. She sits down at a table, alone.  
  
¬† 9:18 p.m.  
  
¬† A sophomore boy, known only to Janie as ‚Äúthe brainiac,‚Äù asks Janie to dance.  
  
¬† She regards him for a moment. ‚ÄúWhy the fuck not,‚Äù she says. She‚Äôs a head taller than him.  
  
¬† He rests his head on her chest and grabs her ass.  
  
¬† She pushes him off her, muttering under her breath, finds Carrie, and tells her she has a ride home and she‚Äôs leaving now.  
  
¬† Carrie waves blissfully from Stu‚Äôs arms.  
  
¬† Janie attacks the back door of the school gym and finds herself in a heavy cloud of smoke. She realizes she‚Äôs found the Goths‚Äô hangout. Who knew?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOof,‚Äù someone says. She keeps walking, muttering ‚Äúsorry‚Äù to whomever it was she hit with the flying door.  
  
¬† After a mile wearing Carrie‚Äôs heels, her feet are killing her. She takes off the shoes and walks in the grassy yards, watching the houses evolve from nice to nasty as she goes along. The grass is already wet with dew, and the yards are getting messier. Her feet are freezing.

1mu8i0x,https://i.redd.it/ihha7y2ikwjf1.jpeg,Amazon stonewalling me? Did I order too much?," I order on Amazon more than I would like to admit. Like my cash back from my Amazon card per years is thousands. I‚Äôve become a bit too reliant on it and it seems they‚Äôve completely removed not only same-day and overnight but even one day for me. Every item that was for sure overnight. All two-day now. I can‚Äôt find anything that‚Äôs even one day. I only realized it was that after really needing something tomorrow and no options were even one-day. I then went digging and everything was two-day. 

The odd thing is this started after I had an order where ‚Äúa problem occurred‚Äù no other update or word. It was something I was waiting on. A lens UV filter. So I went to order another while I‚Äôm supposed to wait out if and when the other one would arrive since I need it, along with the other few things which are now in limbo. When I went to order the replacement, none were one-day. I assumed it was just an odd size since it was my first time ordering that size. But then needing another item asap today, and coming up dry on any one-day options, I went digging. I mean items I‚Äôve ordered dozens of times each which are ALWAYS free overnight. Everything. Every category. Two day only. Not even an option to upgrade to one day. I‚Äôm so confused. 

Sounds a little conspiracy theory but could it be that I order too much overnight and they‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh he‚Äôll order it anyway‚Äù or that they‚Äôre waiting until things shake out with my missing order? I did also have a driver the other day that knew me from online. Super nice guy. Maybe they got word and were suspicious. Idk I‚Äôm so confused. And a bit frustrated. I had a part come in wrong, went to order the correct fittings with atleast one day shipping to get me back on schedule. And nothing. Anyone else experience something like this? 

UPDATE. Literally pre posting this I went to take screen shots. And it‚Äôs all back to normal now. The things I needed and ordered two-day are now available one day. And it shows they‚Äôre coming tomorrow(Tuesday) instead of Wednesday when I ordered them. And the same pieces from different brands are now available same day which is what I was looking for. I literally drove an hour round trip trying to get some locally earlier tonight. How weird. Any ideas?",1,1755577249.0,amazonprime,2,0.67,False
