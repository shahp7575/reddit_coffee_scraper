After my temple ball post a lot of people interested in how exactly I go from plant to hash so I figured I would make a follow up post.
The two damp globs I have pictured are my unmeasured yield from 40g of dried and cured mac 1 trim, the first being my 160 micron the second being my 73, not my ideal or usual setup but this was what I had on hand and was good enough for what this strain is.
The collection process is simple, gather your material(pre soak for an hour if not fresh frozen), gather your micron bags, place material into your highest number micron bag, ensure water temperature is below 40 degrees, stir stir stir not too hard and not too soft, after 15 minutes of agitation remove your bags from the water, pour the water through the micron bags one more time, take your high pressure water source and blast as much plant material off of your collected material in each bag as possible, transfer to pressing screen, press and set aside to dry inside of coffee filters, re wash your material over and over until you are satisfied with the amount extracted/quality ratio, take damp pressed material press as much water out of it as you can before breaking it up into tiny pieces and placing inside four more coffee filters(one on the top three on the bottom do not compact your material) do this with all of your different screen sizes, place these inside of a container with a layer of salt/baking soda/silica gel packets at the bottom to act as a desiccant, place container into fridge and wait at least three days for hash to dry.

**BEFORE YOU READ:**

Chapters 8 and 9 have undergone major revisions with the help of great feedback. I am very happy with the revised state of these chapters and I truly believe they improve the story. The fic is also up on AO3. As always I hope you enjoy it as much as I loved writing it. 

Full fic here:

**Chapter 10: The Preposition**



Coco and Mymy had met Maya every day for the past three weeks, even going out to dinner several times. Each meeting saw Maya becoming more and more involved, comfortable, and happy. They had gotten comfortable talking about trivial topics. They knew their favorite colors, words, planets, dinosaurs and everything in between. They all felt like they were genuinely learning about each other.



Mymy and Coco sat around the dinner table with some of Mymy‚Äôs friends. They talked about Maya, how much more confident and comfortable she seemed, and all the great improvement she had seen, when Coco made a proposal:

‚ÄúMaybe it's time we do something with her.‚Äù



Mymy looked to Coco

‚ÄúI know we made a list but don't you think it may be a bit early? What would we even do?‚Äù¬†

She loved Coco‚Äôs enthusiasm and wanted to do something with Maya as much as She did, but she was also cautious. She only really has been talking to her and Coco and there was no telling how well she‚Äôd do in an environment of strangers.¬†



That's when Evi spoke up:

‚ÄúIf Maya would be interested, my pastor will be giving a short sermon tomorrow after service. Everyone there is extremely welcoming and it wouldn't matter if she has faith or not, everyone is welcome‚Äù



Mymy considered the suggestion. She had been to Evi‚Äôs church before, the people were very friendly and as long as she and Coco were there, they could make sure Maya didn't experience anything more than she could handle. Maya could interact as little or as much as she wanted.



Evi elaborated further:

‚ÄúThe sermon is about loneliness. Father Dekker likes to give sermons that are especially relevant to young people and encourages us to bring anyone who could benefit, most of the people there would be around our age if not a bit younger.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúThis seems like a great idea!‚Äù said Coco excitedly

‚ÄúSo long as we stay close to Maya, she‚Äôll be fine‚Äù



Mymy took a second to think it over

‚ÄúAlright‚Äù she said, encouraged and reassured by her friend and sister

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get Maya on board‚Äù

  


¬†¬†

Maya woke up feeling well rested. The same task once felt like a chore, but recently it was easier, she looked forward to the day. As she got out of bed and began her morning routine, she had been putting more effort into her appearance, she didn't know how to use makeup but she did spend more time looking through her wardrobe, there wasn't much in it however.¬†



As she got dressed she took a look in the mirror. She held her head higher than she used to. Her eyes and expression, once sad and lifeless, now held hope and enthusiasm. Though it wasn't all gone, there was a slowness to her movement and she knew internally the despair and pain lingered. But it was weaker, and she felt better, better than she had felt in a long while.



She grabbed her things and headed out to meet her sisters.



The sisters all arrived at the same time.They quickly exchanged pleasantries, got their drinks and sat at one of the unclaimed tables.

Coco was the first to start the conversation,

‚ÄúAlright. If you had infinite money, where would you go?‚Äù she asked



Mymy responded first, which was appreciated by Maya, it gave her time to think about her answer.¬†



‚ÄúOh that's a good one. I‚Äôd have to chose Suriname‚Äù said Mymy



The strange answer peaked Maya‚Äôs curiosity

‚ÄúSuriname?‚Äù she said inquisitively



‚ÄúYea! It was a Dutch colony in South America from 1667 to 1975. I‚Äôve never been there and it would be cool to go one day.‚Äù¬†

Mymy went on about the Dutch history in the Americas and the unique geography of South America.¬†



When she was done she left a pause in the air to allow Maya to join the conversation, they found that that was when Maya preferred to enter in or give input. When none came she passed the conversation to Coco:



‚ÄúWhat about you Coco? Where would you go?‚Äù



‚ÄúI would go to Australia‚Äù she answered, launching into how she had worked with Australians in South Africa and wanted to visit. She talked about all the unique animals and beautiful reefs.



When she was finished, like Mymy, she left a pause for Maya to hop in. Maya sensed that it was her turn to share. She had grown more comfortable with being asked questions and picking up on social cues.



‚ÄúWell‚Äù she started, speaking softly and with uncertainty

‚ÄúI would like to find an Island with a beach. No particular place, just somewhere I can freely rest. No stress, no problems, just me and the beach.‚Äù As she uttered those final words she felt a surge of uncertainty.

*Do I really want to be all alone on an island? Why would I say something like that!?*



Both Mymy and Coco could see the deeper implications of her answer, as well as Maya‚Äôs uncertainty about it herself. After she answered Maya sank a bit more in her seat allowing her head to hang a bit lower.¬†



Realizing that this was touching something deeper, Mymy spoke up.

‚ÄúMaya‚Äù she said,¬†

‚ÄúYou think that we could join you on that island beach, we‚Äôd love to be there to‚Äù¬†

Her words were filled with genuinity and care, Maya could tell she was talking about more than an imaginary getaway.



Maya smiled¬†

‚ÄúYea‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like that‚Äù¬†



The rest of the time was spent discussing what they would do with limitless money. The conversation was fun, light hearted, and fully engaged with by all the participants.



When the time came to leave, Coco asked one final question:

‚ÄúBefore we go Maya, me and Mymy were wondering if you would want to come with us to a sermon tomorrow?‚Äù



‚ÄúWe can pick you up and get coffee after. It's my friend's church and everyone there will be super friendly and it won't be very long. No faith or anything needed, and you wouldn't have to talk with anyone.‚Äù



Maya was a bit surprised by the request. She never had been religious or much interested in faith. But it didn't take long to figure out why they wanted to try this. It was a welcoming space, a short event, and something just to help her get used to being around people other than her sisters. Should someone have made this request a month ago she would have turned them down without a second thought. But with her sisters, and all the growth she had made, she was tempted to accept.¬†



‚ÄúYou two will be there?‚Äù she asked skeptically

‚ÄúBy your side the whole time‚Äù promised Mymy



‚ÄúIt will be short?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt will only be around an hour, if even that.‚Äù reassured Coco



‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôll get coffee after?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe would love to‚Äù said Mymy



Maya stopped to think for a moment. She thought of all that she had done in the past weeks. The conversations, the success, the socialising, even if it was only with her sisters. She felt strengthened for the first time in years, the thought of attending the event seemed doable. She was still scared, she knew that as the time came she would be terrified and anxious, even thinking about it was sickening. Yet, she wanted to try.



‚ÄúOk‚Äù she said

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it‚Äù



Over the day, Maya's confidence faded. Fear, doubt and anxiety creped forward to haunt her, feelings that had been kept at bay for the past weeks now returned with a vengeance

When Maya went to bed that night her mind was ravaged by anxiety, she hadn't felt this scared in a long time.

Over the past weeks she had come to know and trust her sisters, she truly believed that they loved and cared for her. But despite the knowledge that they would be by her side, she was deathly terrified of what lay ahead. Subconsciously she knew that she wouldn't need to say much, if anything, she knew it would be short. But these truths had been pushed aside.

*You'll say something stupid! You‚Äôll make a fool of yourself! Everyone their will resent you...*

Maya would get little sleep that night.

1jhnbbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1jhnbbv/sorce_sample_reviews/,Sorce Sample Reviews,"Reviews of 5 samples in spray form, on paper, straight out of the mail. 

English Major (library books, orris absolute, marshmallow, decalepis absolute (sustainably harvested): carrot seed, sandalwood, fallen leaves): this is what I expect a perfume like this to smell like, in a good way. Like if you're looking for a sweater that you wore to a bonfire two days ago and you sprayed a musky vanilla on it to cover up the smell. 

2 A.M. in Lafayette (Vanilla co2, oakmoss, cafe au lait, ribbons of caramel, beignets dusted with powdered sugar): cinnamon graham cracker-y. I have a very specific sense memory of eating beignets in New Orleans at Cafe du Monde while it rained, and there is no perfume that is going to specifically trigger that experience. Especially considering I  burned my tongue on the coffee and there was a guy playing Disney songs on a tuba about 5 feet away from me, neither of which are things I've seen captured in a perfume (yet). Fortunately Mama raised a fool but not a quitter so I will keep looking. 

The Lovers (bergamot, iris, jasmine sambac, bamboo, vetiver, green banana, mysore sandalwood, animalic amber): the initial drydown is a jasmine bomb, to the point where I almost didn't pick the paper up for a second sniff. It quickly chills out into a floral rainforest at night; there's something cold, but there's still a little bit of humidity. I'll be interested to see how this translates to skin, and also I want to layer it with something raspberry.

Venus in Fleurs (ripe mango, carnivorous plants, humidity, jasmine sambac absolute, vanilla absolute): I learned my lesson from The Lovers and gave this one a second to develop before smelling. This is Herbal Essences shampoo. Not necessarily what I'm looking for but I could see it being a go to for someone who goes to the gym before work (a mysterious, motivated creature who smells Fresh at all times). 

A Witch's Valentine (Marshmallow, Moroccan rose absolute, raspberry puree, white chocolate, the softest suede): YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS. This almost isn't fair because every note in this is something I adore and will try a scent just for having. The marshmallow is fluffy, the rose is quiet but present and beautifully dewy. I want to eat it and wear it. I will say, this is a rose with raspberry perfume, not a raspberry forward perfume.

Stuck On You (A perfect, crisp apple with a thin caramel shell.): a stunning red apple accord and just a little bit of caramel. Simple but unexpected. 

I also got a free sample of Match Made in Heaven (matcha, vanilla soft serve, cherry blossom, almond, waffle cone, powdered sugar, creamy sandalwood), which I have tried previously. I like it but I don't love it. It's almost buttery, and if it was a dessert I would definitely eat it, but these days I tend to lean more towards spice or greenery than cake. 

I will say, I am a massive Sorce fan (Fuckery is in my top 2 most worn/favorite perfumes of all time), so I had high expectations. I am most into A Witch's Valentine and Stuck On You.  ",3,1742690865.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

Once you've found the perfect leopard print accent chair, the real fun begins: styling it within your space. Here are some tips to make your new chair a focal point:

*   **Balance the Boldness:** as leopard print demands attention, balance it with neutral tones elsewhere in the room. Soft greys, creams, and whites help to ground the space and prevent it from feeling overwhelming.

I just recently upped my dose because I tend to feel kinda like a ""crash"" around mid-day like 5-6pm and I am an undergraduate student studying engineering so while my focus is pretty good during classes I tend to start my studying/homework by 6pm so that sudden onset of fatigue isnt great. I started drinking coffee again, which I know my psychiatrist isnt a fan of me doing since the meds already spike my heart rate and the added caffeine isnt recommended. 

So I upped my dose to 27mg. I started this past Thursday and it felt pretty good! Felt a significant increase in my concentration and energy that lasted throughout the day well past 6pm. Then my period started the next day. It's saturday. I take the meds and it almost feels like im not even taking them at all. My energy, focus, concentration, motivation, productivity etc is all shot to hell.

I'm aware that for any women, periods typically cause this. I have PCOS and previously my PMDD was pretty bad, but since starting medication its actually helped regulate my emotions/moods significantly that I do not experience a lot of PMDD episodes during my period. Usually the week leading up to it and the first couple days it starts I am like, genuinely not okay. So I've noticed that change. But it still sucks that it seems like I procrastinate/hold off starting things all the same when I was unmedicated. I have spoken about this to my psychiatrist, which is also why she suggested increasing the dose. Does this happen to other women with ADHD while taking medication? Is it normal for hormonal fluctuations to diminish the effectiveness of medications? I cannot have like almost 2 weeks out of every month of my time just going down the drain like this, is there a way I can combat this? ",1,1742690627.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Booked a regular 1 King bed and was upgraded to a Deluxe King Bed. Nothing fancy, but met my needs as a hotel room. As part of Taiwan‚Äôs environmental friendly initiative, they don‚Äôt have one time use bathroom/room amenities like toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.

Location: Outside of the main Taipei city area, but you can easily walk 0.5 miles (10-15 mins) to the MRT station and hop on the Airport Line to get to Taipei Main Station on 5-10 mins. We took a taxi from Taoyuan Airport to the Hyatt Place after arriving at night and the 25-30 mins ride with no traffic was 1045 NTD.

Globalist: Room was actively upgraded. Upon arrival, they had a globalist amenity which was 2 sparking canned drinks and a couple snacks. We were also given 2 non-alcoholic drink vouchers for the coffee shop on the first floor of the hotel. Daily 2 bottles water. Free daily breakfast.

Breakfast: I‚Äôve been to many Hyatt Places in the US, and I was not expecting much. But the breakfast here was ok. They had hot foods, cold foods, and a noodle station. The food was a mix of Taiwanese and Asian cuisine and western/American foods. There were coffee/espresso machines, fresh soy milk, regular milk, and juices. I noticed the hotel seems to work with large tour groups. The breakfast area is big and can get loud (echoes). But the food was replenished in a timely manner despite having so many guests, so I wasn‚Äôt bothered by the large groups.

Self-Service Laundry: I was happy to learn they had self-service laundry available. It was 100 NTD for a load of laundry in the washer. The dry charged 10 NTD/3 mins. They only take coins but the front desk can exchange bills for coins if you want to use their laundry facilities.

Overall: I was pleasantly surprised by my stay and enjoyed it. The walk to the MRT might be far to some people, but I found it to be fine for me. I think this is a nice cheap option close to Taipei city if people want to save on cash or points. It is one of the better Cat 1 that I have stayed at in a while.

I still want to scream. I still know it wouldn‚Äôt help.

Why the fuck can I not stop thinking about you and the short time we spent together. I should hate you. You hate me, and I should hate you too.

I don‚Äôt know. I miss venting to you. I miss how you made me feel better so effortlessly. I still vent, usually to ChatGPT (which has named itself Rowan in our chats) but it always responds in a way that is so unsatisfying to me.

Anyways, here‚Äôs the vent you don‚Äôt want and won‚Äôt read:

I‚Äôm so fucking tired. I don‚Äôt want to be virtuous anymore. I used to pray all the time, back when I was a kid and religion really meant everything to me, that God would make me like Job. Then I grew up. He‚Äôs given me trials, and I have come to the stark realization that I do not have the willpower he had. 

I don‚Äôt want to be patient. I‚Äôve spent too long waiting.

I don‚Äôt want to be considerate. I‚Äôm beat down from no one else caring.

I don‚Äôt want to be strong. I need to be weak now. I need arms I can fall into without guilt.

I don‚Äôt want to be humble. Everything I‚Äôve been proud of has been ripped away from me, even my own life.

I don‚Äôt want to be wise. I can‚Äôt take another day of having to try to understand the senseless.

Resilience gets romanticized so easily, but it‚Äôs just what‚Äôs left when life refuses you a single simple kindness. It‚Äôs not beautiful. It‚Äôs exhausting. It‚Äôs raw, scared, and deeply sad. I never signed up to be a saint. And I never signed up to die like a martyr.

I want to tell you what you want to hear more than I want to tell you the truth. If it helps you to believe that I only loved you because I was scared to die alone, I want to tell you that. If it helps you to believe I was just going crazy, I want to tell you that. 

But I can‚Äôt. I want to tell you what you want to hear more than I want to tell you the truth, but the truth burns holes in my stomach and overtakes my brain. Since you‚Äôre not here anyways, I can finally say it.

Some part of me needs you. The part that refuses to let me think of anything else. I fucking miss you. Holy shit, do I miss you. I miss you just telling me updates about your life while we sit together and drink cold coffee.

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(28+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/OxamSqG)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

1jhmpsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1jhmpsw/beans_advice_needed/,Beans Advice Needed,"Hi, it's been about a year of me having and exploring speciality coffee but there is a mindset I cannot get rid of.

I biy only one 250gm bag of coffee a month. And instead of just normally ordering another one as soon as this is finished, I try to use it on a monthly basis.

Just from my mindset, I try to make that bag last about a month, including having a coffee (using beans) only once in two days or something similar.

Is that alright and normal or is it because of my pre-built mindset regarding monthly rations (have a habit of buying snacks and kitchen stuff monthly) 

It's not that I can't afford it, I just don't know can't get used to that idea. A few months back got like 2-3 bags at once and they lasted me a long long while just cuz of this.

But there's not much action here.

So I made a smart decision not to go to that birthday party thing.

Woke up to two missed calls from Horoscope Girl. Ignored them. Left my phone at home on purpose so I wouldn‚Äôt get tempted, went out to feed. Got back, started messing with the boiler again. Seemed fitting, spending the evening elbow-deep in something disgusting. Thats my speed.

Then the phone rings again. I swear I blinked across the room for it. It‚Äôs her. She says they already had the cake and now they‚Äôre heading out for a bar crawl. Asks if I‚Äôm off work yet. I say yes, lie about being tired. They‚Äôre heading out for drinks. Crawl-style. And they‚Äôre already halfway to the first spot.

It starts right at the edge of campus, like one step off school property and you‚Äôre in it. Street's tight, slightly crooked, sloped like it‚Äôs trying to tip you forward. All old stonework and cracked pavement, packed elbow-to-elbow with tiny bars and basement-level clubs.

It pulls people downhill. Gravity and booze. The whole area‚Äôs designed to funnel folks toward the harbor, by the time they're a few drinks in, they‚Äôre sliding that way without realizing it. End of the road is a cluster of clubs in gutted out warehouses, a few food joints open stupid late, and then the harbor itself. Old shipping containers stacked like legos, and a long stretch of green nobody really looks after. Bushes thick enough to lose someone in. That kind of place.

And I swear that‚Äôs on purpose. The whole strip‚Äôs too perfect. Too convenient, You know what I mean? Bars too close together, dark corners too frequent, no cops. No one asks for ID. Technically there‚Äôs a park, but you wouldn‚Äôt bring a kid there. You wouldn't bring a dog.

So now I have to go. Safety reasons. SAFETY. I‚Äôm not hungry, I washed my hair yesterday, and clubs are dark. I‚Äôll pass for kine. Probably.

So I go.

The first place is called The Greenhouse. It‚Äôs all brick walls, hanging plants, and weirdly clean for a bar this close to campus. They‚Äôve got fairy lights strung up and a menu that includes actual coffee, so technically you could have lunch there. Smells like espresso and citrus cleaner.

Horoscope Girl‚Äôs there already. She has a little choker on, green like her eyeliner. Pretty. When she spots me, her face lights up like it was never a doubt I‚Äôd show up. Like I hadn‚Äôt ignored two calls and a text. It feels nice, she looks like she wanted me here for real.

Aquarius Shrimp is there too, just ugh. Then there‚Äôs another guy. Quiet, glasses, sharp eyes. Nice hands. Has that kind of voice... Warm one? I don‚Äôt catch his name. Mentally labeled as Sexy Nerd.

Then there‚Äôs a girl with white hair. Slight greenish tone to it, she's as pale as me, or even more.

I buy everyone those mason jar drinks, they look like someone dunked salad in vodka. I say I‚Äôm not drinking since I'm on a cut. Macros. Keto. (I just haaaaate puking.)

She turns toward me and asks if I play sports. I say I used to. Then I got injured. (Death counts as an injury.)

Horoscope Girl chimes in to describe me, because apparently White Hair can barely see unless you‚Äôre right up close. Albinism, the White Hair says. It messes with vision, not just skin. I didn‚Äôt know that.

Anyway, calling her White Hair feels shitty, so for the story, let‚Äôs call her Anna.

That‚Äôs how I end up getting, I don‚Äôt know, palpated? I take my hoodie off, and she starts feeling my face, arms, shoulders. Then she finds my biceps and just loses it. Laughs like she‚Äôs checking if I‚Äôm real. Keeps squeezing like she does not believe I'm real person. For a second, it‚Äôs almost nice. Funny, even. I'm just muscles and skin, nothing complicated or sinister. I let it happen. It breaks the ice. Everyone laughs. Anna‚Äôs cool. I like her. We talk about school. She tells me why she moved here. Apparently campus is like, adjusted for blind people in some super extra ways. I've noticed It too, but I had nothing to compare.

We head to the Black Dog Tavern next. Smells like stale beer and something wet under the floorboards. Music‚Äôs playing, sort of. The sound‚Äôs more of a suggestion. I lose track of Horoscope Girl for a bit, then she comes back with a new girl in tow.

Small. Bit shabby, in a nice way. Wears a thick sweater with little bows sewn on, like she patched it up herself. Doesn‚Äôt say much. Horoscope Girl is a stray collector, I have no right to question it.

We drink beer. Play pool. I hang back, let them take their shots. Horoscope Girl leans over the table like she's in a music video. Eyes bright, cue held completely wrong, hair in her face. It shouldn‚Äôt work. It does. The table is slanted anyway. She's winning because the stars said so.

At some point there‚Äôs pizza. Big slices, grease bleeding through the cardboard. We eat it on the curb. Well, they do, I loudly judge the pizza, because it is, truthfully, not even close to what pizza should be. Horoscope Girl‚Äôs talking about how mushrooms are ruled by Pluto. Sexy Nerd asks if anyone smokes.

I toss him my tin. It‚Äôs old, scuffed metal with a faded Drina logo on the front and he frowns at the label.

‚ÄúThat a brand?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey used to give merch with lung cancer. Lucky Strikes inside, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù

We toss it back and forth a few times. They never saw a cigarette tin. I love it. I love sitting in a circle, I love laughing at passersby like we are the cool kids. I am just so happy. I gave Bow Girl my jacket, it‚Äôs too cold to just be wearing a sweater. It reaches below her knees and she looks like a tiny penguin. She asks if I‚Äôm not cold and I wave her off. I even remembered to make myself warmer just so it lingers on the jacket.

Aquarius Shrimp waves our cigarettes off and pulls out a vape that stinks of mango and battery acid. Fuck him.

Next stop‚Äôs some bar that tries way too hard. Velvet curtains with puke stains at the bottom, low lights, plastic ""goblets"", drinks that come with syringes of red syrup. You know the type of place? Everyone thinks it‚Äôs fun, and I can‚Äôt even blame them.

Our group‚Äôs crowded around a table, laughing, squeezing red syrup into their glasses. Horoscope Girl smears some on her lip, pretending to bite Aquarius Shrimp‚Äôs neck. They‚Äôre giggling. It‚Äôs harmless. She turns to me smiling like she‚Äôs inviting me into the joke. Friendly. Warm. Red sticky goop on her face.

But I just... I don't like it. It‚Äôs like watching porn in public. There is a thick plastic razorblade in the beer someone gave me. I shake my head, mumble something about air, and step out before anyone can ask again.

I brace against the wall, stare at the sidewalk, try to pull my skin back on. Footsteps approach, soft ones. It‚Äôs Bow Sweater Girl. Looks at me with those giant eyes. One of the bows slipping down the side of her sleeve. She doesn‚Äôt say anything. Just stands a few steps away with my jacket in hands.

I look away, annoyed it‚Äôs not who I wanted. I'm so fucking selfish. It's her birthday and I'm being a mopey shit.

A minute later, the rest of them spill outside, loud, still laughing. Turns out the drinks were expensive, and someone wants to dance. Horoscope Girl grabs my hand. I follow her wherever we are going.

Next place is aggressively 2000s in a way that somehow works. I guess? I was pretty much out through that decade. Like, buried under literal rock. But even I can recognize Toxic by Britney Spears. Sweater Bow Girl says it‚Äôs Y2K and that there‚Äôs a vending machine in the bathroom selling body glitter and glow-in-the-dark lube, like she wants me to go see it.

I have zero idea what to do with that information.

Anna‚Äôs hair lights up under the UV like it‚Äôs radioactive. Someone stuck a star sticker on her cheekbone. She looks like she was drawn in highlighter.

I stay near the wall at first. Sexy Nerd nods at me as he walks past, like he knows I‚Äôll follow eventually. The gall on him.

I do.

And then, I‚Äôm dancing. Not on purpose. Just sort of... melting into it. Shoulders down. Hips loose. Jaw unclenched. Why not? Someone bumps me and I don‚Äôt snarl. That‚Äôs progress. I'm good. We are all dancing. Bow Sweater Girl is grabbing my wrist like she wants me to come closer and I spin her around instead.

I feel like I‚Äôm buzzed. Like I got drunk by osmosis and overstimulation. If the group didn‚Äôt drag me outside by force I‚Äôd stay there till dawn and you would not have to read this.

But they did. We basically roll ourselves over the road, to the ""Lighthouse"". Not a real lighthouse, just a bar.

Outside, Anna‚Äôs throwing up near the curb. Sexy Nerd‚Äôs holding her hair, quiet and steady, like he‚Äôs done this before. He doesn‚Äôt flinch when she spits red slush on his shoes. Proper guy, respectable. He‚Äôs got her hair pulled back with one hand, texting with the other. Multi-tasking.

Inside, the rest of the group is slumped in a corner booth that‚Äôs peeling at the edges. Horoscope Girl curled up on one side, half-asleep on her arms. Dead to the world but smiling. Aquarius Shrimp is hovering over her, trying something. I hate him so much.

The night is... ending. I don't want that.

I‚Äôm planted in the booth across from them. It‚Äôs not even that I want to dance more or drink more or talk more.

I just don‚Äôt want to go back yet. I know what's coming. Everyone is coupled up. I can feel that... you know. Gnawing feeling. Sweater Bow is looking at me all worked up. No. Not yet, please. I am still happy.

The Sweater Bow asks if I want to go see the water. I ask her how old she is, and she tells me 21. My ass. She gives me a smile that I know is enticing but I just cannot emotionally register that. It does not really work on me. I'd much rather listen to her talk about something or sit here and listen to the music from Horoscope girl's phone together.

I say okay. We can go see the water now. Lot happened after that.",5,1742688974.0,SchreckNet,2,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt know. I miss venting to you. I miss how you made me feel better so effortlessly. I still vent, usually to ChatGPT (which has named itself Rowan in our chats) but it always responds in a way that is so unsatisfying to me.

Anyways, here‚Äôs the vent you don‚Äôt want and won‚Äôt read:

I‚Äôm so fucking tired. I don‚Äôt want to be virtuous anymore. I used to pray all the time, back when I was a kid and religion really meant everything to me, that God would make me like Job. Then I grew up. He‚Äôs given me trials, and I have come to the stark realization that I do not have the willpower he had. 

I don‚Äôt want to be patient. I‚Äôve spent too long waiting.

I don‚Äôt want to be considerate. I‚Äôm beat down from no one else caring.

I don‚Äôt want to be strong. I need to be weak now. I need arms I can fall into without guilt.

I don‚Äôt want to be humble. Everything I‚Äôve been proud of has been ripped away from me, even my own life.

I don‚Äôt want to be wise. I can‚Äôt take another day of having to try to understand the senseless.

Resilience gets romanticized so easily, but it‚Äôs just what‚Äôs left when life refuses you a single simple kindness. It‚Äôs not beautiful. It‚Äôs exhausting. It‚Äôs raw, scared, and deeply sad. I never signed up to be a saint. And I never signed up to die like a martyr.

.

Rant over. I know I‚Äôm definitely safe from you reading this now, so I can say what I really need to‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt get you off my mind, David. But I can‚Äôt. I want to reach out so bad.. but I feel worse about trying to make you want to hear from me when you don‚Äôt. 

 
I want to tell you what you want to hear more than I want to tell you the truth. If it helps you to believe that I only loved you because I was scared to die alone, I want to tell you that. If it helps you to believe I was just going crazy, I want to tell you that. 

But I can‚Äôt. I want to tell you what you want to hear more than I want to tell you the truth, but the truth burns holes in my stomach and overtakes my brain. Since you‚Äôre not here anyways, I can finally say it.

Some part of me needs you. The part that refuses to let me think of anything else. I fucking miss you. Holy shit, do I miss you. I miss you just telling me updates about your life while we sit together and drink cold coffee. 

My heat is broken, so is my hot water. I‚Äôm lying here in bed wishing you were here holding me. I miss your warmth.

I wish you‚Äôd text me. I wish you‚Äôd tell me you‚Äôre coming over. I‚Äôd do anything to take the future pain away and make you able to be around me. I miss you a lot. I can‚Äôt make myself stop loving you a lot. ",3,1742688956.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

A few weeks back, I was doing a rotation in gen med under this senior consultant who‚Äôs been around since before the invention of the fax machine (but still insists it‚Äôs superior to email). Basically a dinosaur.

Lovely guy, great teacher, just a bit stiff upper lip, you know the type. Wears the same tweed jacket every Thursday and refers to TikTok as ‚Äúthat dancing app‚Äù.

Anyway, during the ward rounds, I had this bad habit (or talent?) of replying to literally everything with ‚Äúeasy clap‚Äù instead of the usual ‚Äúno worries‚Äù or ‚Äútoo easy‚Äù. 

Consultant asks me to chase a scan? ‚ÄúEasy clap.‚Äù Needs a discharge summary done? ‚ÄúEasy clap.‚Äù Wants someone to call the reg? ‚ÄúEasy clap.‚Äù You get the idea.

I didn‚Äôt even realise how often I was saying it until one day, I heard him repeat it back to me. I handed over a completed list of jobs and he just goes, ‚ÄúAhh, easy clap.‚Äù Like it was the most natural thing in the world. I froze. The reg side-eyed me so hard I nearly coded.

I thought it was a one-off. Nope.

Over the next few weeks, he started using it more and more. NUM asks if we‚Äôre going to review the patient. ‚ÄúYep. Easy clap.‚Äù

One day, I overheard him on the phone with a registrar and he legit ended the call with, ‚ÄúYep, that should be all sorted. Easy clap.‚Äù

The SRMO nearly dropped her fucking coffee.

Now it‚Äôs just a normal part of his vocabulary. He‚Äôs using it regularly. I swear to god this is true. 

The best part? I think he genuinely believes it‚Äôs just a new bit of hospital slang. Like it‚Äôs part of the natural evolution between ‚Äúcheers‚Äù, ‚Äúno worries‚Äù and ‚Äúall good‚Äù.

I haven‚Äôt had the heart (or guts) to tell him what it actually means. He even used it in front of the other consultants during an M&M meeting which is when I realised what I had created. A lot of eyebrows were raised that day. 

I think I‚Äôve broken him. Or maybe upgraded him?

Anyway, just here to confess my sins. If you see an older Gen Med consultant in Sydney going around saying ‚Äúeasy clap‚Äù like he‚Äôs a Twitch streamer from 2017 - that‚Äôs my fault. Easy clap.

We share a laptop since hers had an unfortunate accident with coffee about 6 months ago. She's in her final year of her PhD program studying something in marine biology.

Yesterday I was trying to download some games from the Steam sale (just 3-4 titles I've had on my wishlist forever) but kept getting storage errors. I checked our disk space and noticed her university folder was taking up almost 180GB. I looked through it and saw it was mostly videos of fish, spreadsheets with numbers, and multiple copies of what looked like the same document with different dates.

I looked for an external drive to move the files to, but couldn't find one. I texted her asking if she needed all those duplicate files but she was in the middle of some lab work and didn't respond for hours. I had already promised my friends I'd be online for our weekly gaming session, so I made what I thought was a reasonable decision - I moved the oldest looking files that appeared to be duplicates to the recycle bin to free up space (about 85GB worth).

When she got home and opened the laptop this morning, she had a complete meltdown. Apparently those ""duplicates"" were different versions of her thesis drafts with important changes, and the videos were from experiments she's been running for months. She's saying I deleted irreplaceable data that she needs for her dissertation defense next month.

I genuinely thought she would have important stuff backed up to the cloud or something. I even suggested she could probably redo some of the experiments if needed since she still has a few weeks, and I offered to help her rewrite some of the text parts on weekends. I don't understand why she's acting like I intentionally sabotaged her - it was just a misunderstanding about storage.

She hasn't spoken to me since and is staying at the university library ""trying to salvage what's left."" I feel bad that she's upset, but I also feel like she's being a bit dramatic and should have been more careful with her work if it was so crucial.

1jhmg2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/1jhmg2o/my_theory_on_why_la_dating_can_be_so_miserable/,My theory on why LA dating can be so miserable! (Once you reach your 30s),"The dating scene in Cali is fine, some of the most beautiful people in the world are here, however the dating scene in LA is miserable once you're over 30.  Couple of things make this city in particular a very difficult to date. Let me preface all of this with the disclaimer that if you just want a casual hookup, LA or really any city with 250k people or more is going to be perfectly fine. This isn't about dating, or if you're a romantic dating with a purpose, and why (in just my opinion, feel free to disagree) is difficult in this city. Not impossible, not the worst, just...difficult, verging on miserable. Okay, let's begin...

  
1. Distance / Travel - People consider dating on the other side of the city a ""long distance relationship"" no joke, I have CLOSE friends who once they moved more than 5 miles away I went from seeing them 2-3x a month to 4-5 times A YEAR. Don't even bother if you don't have a car as a man. If you're a woman/non binary the man will come to you so you can do okay, if you're a man just start saving up for that 90s Accord Honda, unless you are planning to date someone who lives on your same city block. And even then...good luck finding a person who wants to date a dude who rides the bus and metro everywhere. It's not even a status thing, it's a safety thing, no woman wants to get on a metro bus at 10pm on the red line (or whatever asinine name it's now called) and have to roll the dice her man can protect her if something truly goes down. I'd say it's just an opinion but I've heard this argument voiced enough times that it's definitely a factor.

2. Expensive - City is just expensive, yes not as expensive as Miami, NYC or San Fran but it's up there and if you are a guy and a gentleman you are paying for both parties. A typical humble date will easily cost a guy $100 - $300 easily. In fact according to [AllMenus.com](http://AllMenus.com) [Fandango.com](http://Fandango.com) and USA Today the average date in LA makes it the 2nd most expensive dating city, with an official average of $207 per date. 2nd only behind San Francisco. You combine that with the average one bedroom apartment in LA costing $2,745 per month and gas prices currently around $4.50/g and things start to come together. I remember once I took my ex-girlfriend ice skating and out to eat. The skating cost me $80 (it would have cost $100 but she had her own skates), dinner cost an additional $40 and parking for the skating cost $10, and that was considered a ""cheap date."" Technically it was under the average, only clocking in at a measly $130. (not including gas)

3. Expectations - This is a city where people assume that $100K a year is working class, and it kinda is. So there are some wild expectations on what to do, how often you do it and your means to do it. Even outside of money, expectations can be heavy. A recent study from the[ LA times!](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-single-adults-los-angeles-20140917-story.html#:~:text=A%20recent%20spate%20of%20reports,respond:%20%E2%80%9CAre%20you%20kidding) Says nearly 60% of the city's population is single, this is a city that doesn't actually want to get serious unless you are damn near perfect. Only 4 cities have a higher single population, with New Orleans being the #1.

4. No club, dance or mass social event culture - LA is a city with a lot of people but it is not a casual social city. People stay within their bubbles, except for networking events for career/industry. Club scene is dead, not dying, dead. If you are straight that is. They're too expensive and a young person's game, the clubs aren't fun, no theme, terrible parking/safety/cleanliness in the best locales, except MAYBE WeHo. (Terrible parking but not the worst.) or MAYBE Santa Monica (traffic, distance, expensive if you aren't living on Westside.) People also don't hang out in social situations where you can meet folks. Single women are never out alone, and if they are out they're with a bunch of their friends, which means to have a shot to cold approach you gotta be with a lot of usually single men. This is easier in your 20s, but miss that boat and by your 30s it's all married or very committed men and women out in groups. And good luck getting your guy friends to go out and actually wingman with you. Their girlfriends/partners and spouses are not going to be thrilled about the idea of them going out to places to meet women, even if the women are for you to meet. (Can't say if this logic is the same in the reverse with women seeking men,) 

""What about taking your queer friend with you to help wingman?""

""Not a bad idea until they assume you are with said queer friend."" WOMP WOMP (yes it happens, may we all be so lucky to date a queer person with good fashion sense)

Coffee shops, libraries, parks, museums, everyone walks around with headphones in, no chance to strike up a conversation. And it's not really the vibe to do so in the best scenarios. We are not a city built on random conversations, that's why even in film they have to have networking events because even our spontaneous friendships need to be predicated with an event that you go to. Speaking of which...

5. Dating apps - Miserable, because people, have too high of ""standards"" online. We reject people who if we met in person we'd absolutely give a shot. But everyone is chasing after the top 2% of good looking folks they see on the app (even though most of those profiles are fake) and always think they're just one swipe away from their physical dream person. Now this isn't a generalization but another harsh reality that I know happens is many folks, in particular **but not limited to** straight or queer women simply do not use dating apps to date. They use it to get a nice ego boost when they see someone has liked their profile. Don't shoot the messenger! This isn't a call out, I say this with a neutral tone, I've just spoken to a fair amount of women who admit that's all they use it for now. Not to mention I literally got a check in the mail from a class action lawsuit, apparently apps like Bumble were not showing me in the algorithm because I was under 5' 10"". Which is...I've never been conscious about my height, I've dated women taller and shorter than me, it's a non factor personally but I guess the idea of an average height dude on a dating app was so repulsive to Bumble staff that a year later they had to shell me out $65 as an apology lol. So just so you know fellas if you are on a dating app, never put in your height anywhere as the algorithm or the woman herself might filter you out if you're under 6 feet that is. If you are 6 feet put that thing immediately in the profile you'll shoot to the top of the deck, just a little advice.

  
6. Set in our ways - Increasingly I have found that people of all genders once they pass the age of 30-32 become increasingly set in their ways. If they've been single for that long what benefit does a real relationship give them now? Sure maybe they're open to the idea in an abstract sense, but truly...no they're not. They don't want to change or modify their plan in any significant way, which SURPRISE a partner, a family might do. So unless you check off almost every box people move on quickly, or keep things ultra casual. But say if you want to date someone who is starting to make progress in the film industry, or climbing the corporate ladder they're most likely not going to date you seriously unless you don't disrupt any significant part of that plan. Not to even get into the idea that again while this city is friendly its VERY insular, people like their routines and their status. Anything that could screw that up doesn't last in their orbit long. Sorry. 

\*\*tl;dr\*\* - LA has unrealistic standards and a poor environment for meeting new single people, socially financially and physically. Bad traffic and poor public transportation are major hinderances. And the dating app market has created both fantastical expectations and an addiction to validation instead of curiosity. Dating in your 30s here isn't super fun.",5,1742688229.0,LosAngeles,3,0.7,False

When I first started teaching Italian, one of the most intriguing lessons was on the verb *volere*. It's like taking students on a rollercoaster ride of desires, demands, and dreams. The magic of *volere* is that it's not just about wanting; it's about the nuances of how we express our desires. Let me take you on a little journey with *volere*.

**The many faces of *volere***

In Italian, *volere* is the go-to verb for expressing ""want."" But it's not just any verb‚Äîit's an irregular modal verb. This means it‚Äôs a bit like that quirky friend who never follows the rules but is always there when you need them.

**Expressing desires**

Imagine you're a kid dreaming of the future. You might say, *Da grande voglio fare l‚Äôinsegnante* (When I grow up, I want to be a teacher). It's all about expressing what your heart truly desires.

**A strong will**

Picture Angelo, determined to quit smoking. He might say, *Angelo vuole smettere di fumare.* It's a testament to his strong will, like a dog with a bone.

**Making demands**

Then there's Giorgio, who wants his money back. *Giorgio vuole i soldi che gli devi.* It's like when a friend insists on getting their favorite movie back that you borrowed ages ago.

**Wishing in the conditional**

The conditional form of *volere* adds a sprinkle of politeness or wistfulness. You might say, *Vorrei un caff√®, per favore* (I would like a coffee, please). It's like a gentle nudge to the universe for a little caffeine boost.

**Your turn**

So, what do you *volere* today? Share your thoughts or questions in the comments!

There are some edits in each that I've included from the feedback I received on the first subreddit. I wanted to see if I could get some more eyes on this and feedback as it has all been tremendously helpful thus far. Thank you any and all for your time and insight:

Version 1:

Hello there, thank you for stopping by:

I‚Äôm a 38 year old straight male looking for genuine connection with a desire for intimacy if the chemistry and attraction are there. In my experience, relationships are built through clear communication, honesty, and reciprocity, and I strive to embody those values. In that spirit I will be upfront, I‚Äôm in a long term, non-monogamous relationship, but any relationship I pursue here would be exclusive to me, no couples dynamics involved. I'm primarily interested in finding just one (mayyybe two) rock solid relationships to foster and build upon. I know that adult life gets busy so I want to give the right amount of attention to anyone I meet.

A bit about me:

Art & Creativity: I enjoy black and white photography and surrealist artists like Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski.

Movies & Music: I enjoy a wide range of films (a favorite is There Will Be Blood) and have been into metal for 25+ years, though I‚Äôm open to most genres outside of rap and country.

Reading & Philosophy: I‚Äôm an avid reader and enjoy both fiction and nonfiction. I have an affinity for both Greek and Eastern philosophy and I also dabble in reading some existentialism and transcendentalism.

Food & Travel: I love both and will frequently drive to other cities for a restaurant/food item I like or one that I haven't tried yet. I have a very adventurous palate for food and I'm always up for trying something new, so long as I know it won't kill me or make me sick.

Craftsmanship & Work: My current job is hands-on and trade-adjacent. I do a mix of groundskeeping, carpentry, construction, etc. and I am always researching new things to learn and improve on. My last long term career was as a craft coffee roaster.

Nerdy Pursuits: I play Magic: The Gathering with friends, D&D a couple of times a month, and have been into gaming since the Atari/NES days.

Fitness & Outdoors: I go to the gym three times a week for strength training and recently started jogging, I‚Äôm almost at the ""not sucking"" stage. I also enjoy being outside so nature walks, hiking and camping are a love of mine.


I tend to be candid and an open book so if anything here sparks your interest please reach out, I‚Äôd love to chat. If things click that's great! If not, no worries, I wish you the best either way.

I'm very lucky to live in a hot climate so every morning its beautifully hot and sunny. It's my one day off. I've decided I'm not going to the gym today. Fuck it, it's not noticed anyway (thus the dead bedroom grumble begins) 

So I tiptoe out the bedroom,  leaving my partner to his slumber, give the cat a scratch behind the ears (to make up for not giving into his demands for food at 4am) Fill the kettle then feed the cats before wandering down to get the morning paper out of the postbox. 

After that, it's time to feed the chickens and grab the eggs they've laid, which later, I will use to bake a cake. After all, everyone loves fresh eggs right? Now that's done,  I can settle down with my coffee and paper and enjoy the sun on my face. I love my quaint little life.

However. This is the dead bedroom sub after all.

And do you know what would make my quaint little life even better?

We lie like that for a while, until I can feel him growing hard behind me, making me smile and push my butt back into him, letting him know that I am very much in favour of that, leading to lazy Sunday Morning sex.

This isn't erotica, I won't go into TOO MUCH detail. But afterwards we would lie in post coital bliss with lots of kissing,  lots of touching, lots of arm tickles (because I know how much we all crave physical touch) before then I go and make us coffee and lie in his arms,  him on his phone, me reading my paper.

But no of course that won't happen.  That's my dream World. Ill be lucky to get a kiss on the head and a dry peck if he leaves the house.
Sex? Pfft. ""Now? Its too late. It's too early, I'm tired, I'm still sleeping, I've got a headache"" etc etc etc

Eventually, I decided to try desi (traditional) medicine and visited a nearby hakeem. He gave me some pills, and within just seven days, my dandruff and itching completely disappeared. After four years of suffering, it was gone! I continued taking the pills for about a month. He also advised me to avoid spicy foods, all kinds of meat (including chicken), and all nuts‚Äîbasically, any ""warm"" foods. I followed his advice strictly because I really wanted to get rid of the itching.

One day, I woke up with severe indigestion. My stomach felt jammed, but I thought it was temporary since I had long-term constipation issues. However, from that day on, I started experiencing stomach pain, bloating, and severe gas. It got so bad that I couldn't even digest water it feels heavy like someone put 5 kg weight on my stomach. When I went to a doctor, he diagnosed me with acute gastritis and gave me some pills and syrup. Unfortunately, they only helped for two days.

Since it‚Äôs Ramadan, I avoided eating anything heavy. But recently, I started eating warm foods again to see if I could digest them. Surprisingly, it has been working! For the past two days, I‚Äôve been eating warm foods, including coffee, and I feel much better‚Äîfinally relaxed after two months. But now, my itching is returning, and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

My son's nicotine vape ended up in one of my MJ pouch, and in my sleepy state, I took a few hits off it this morning. I sat on the couch and thought for a second about what's different, what tastes weird and fruity - certainly not MY vape, saw it was his and put it on the kitchen table. Then I got up to take my meds, refill my coffee and feed the dogs. And my brain was kinda clear - like my brain fog was maybe 65% cleared up? It's never gone... nothing takes care of it honestly. 

I did a quick google and it was definitely the little bit of Nic I got. I know vaping is unhealthy - but the results were amazing.

1jhlyio,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jhlyio,Heat Lamp Repair,"I will preface this by saying I am not an electrician, but I work in avionics and have a background in wire repair on aircraft. I fully acknowledge that home electric is a different beast, which is why I'm soliciting advice.

Back in 2019 I bought a coffee table style terrarium for my snakes; it was preowned and I'm pretty sure it's hand built and wired. Recently, every heat bulb I have replaced in it has burnt out in a matter of weeks and tripped the breaker, and today the new bulb was emitting a more intense burning smell. I took it apart and it's DEFINITELY a DIY lamp build. From what I have found, it's built from a Leviton 9874 porcelain base and extension cable. I did not take a before picture, but to describe it, the bare stranded wire was wrapped under the screws and the wires were heavily kinked and looked to be burnt in a few places (pictured, after I'd clipped the wires); the whole back was also covered in electrical tape. It's never started a fire before but even with my limited knowledge of wiring, it just looked wrong and potentially hazardous. 

The above is my repair on it. I trimmed the compromised wire and crimped on some ring terminals (I plan on giving the wires more slack so they sit flush when I re-install it). I tested it and it does work, the terminals aren't overheating and glowing red or anything, but my understanding is that I should not cover the back with electrical tape like it had been before. So should I leave it as it is? Or is there a benefit to slapping some tape on the back like the creator did?

Also, any educated guesses on why the heat bulbs keep burning out this quickly and tripping the breaker? I do run it 24/7 but previously the bulbs were lasting months to a year. I'm currently using a 120V 60Hz 75W incandescent heat bulb and the Leviton is rated at 660W 250V, the cable is rated 300V. I'm wondering if I need to go to a lower wattage, or maybe there's a completely different problem I'm overlooking. 

Thanks for any input.

TLDR: Does this look wired correctly with minimal risk of setting my apartment on fire? Should I put electrical tape over it? And why is it burning out so quickly and tripping the breaker?",1,1742686784.0,AskElectricians,2,1.0,False
1jhlyhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1jhlyhz/how_to_lose_2_pounds_per_week_while_lifting/,How to lose 2 pounds per week while lifting weights? Managing expectations....,"Hi Zeppers! I started on Feb 1 2025: Female 47 year old, 5'3 . SW: 170 CW: 158 GW: 130  
I'm finishing up my second month at 2.5. Considering going up to 5 for my 3rd month on Zep.

I have about 40 pounds to lose and I'm feeling bummed about how slow this is going. I lost 6 pounds my first¬†week and then it's slowed¬†WAY down to about 1 pound per week.¬†

More about my situation:¬†

For my diet, I am pretty much eating the same things every day to make it really simple, around 14200 calories, although I did just realize that I may be overdoing it with the protein powder. I put a serving (4 TBSP) of Vital proteins in my coffee (20 g protein and 70 calories) each morning with my breakfast (scoop of egg salad on 1 pc. of toast) AND then for Lunch, about 4 hours later, I have a protein smoothie (25 grams of protein with cup and half of 1% milk, comes to about 385 calories) and then a sensible dinner of chicken breast or ground beef with a big salad (fruits and veggies).

The good news is that my body recomposition has been pretty rapid.  In just 7 weeks, I've put on a lot of muscle and my arms and torso are getting quite lean. My lower body¬†has not changed much but I hope that will start soon. I'm walking about 60 minutes per day on my treadmill, and working out with weights 4-5 times per week for about 40 minutes. On Saturdays I do a rest day. I feel amazing overall!

I've been working out since the beginning. I have so much motivation and I can't believe how consistent I have been with my diet and movement. This drug has helped my mental health so much as well. I am so much more productive, mentally calm, and assertive and direct with other people. I think food noise really messed up my emotional regulation, because I used to experience a lot of overwhelm and anxiety, and I can't believe how on top of my life I have been and just sharp in a way I haven't felt in a long time.

SO here's my struggle: 

The first week I lost 6 pounds and then since then I've lost about a pound a week, sometimes a half a pound or a third of a pound. Last week I actually gained a pound. I heard someone say online that if you're losing 1 pound a week, you're doing everything right. But it just feels so slow!

I know that this is a long haul and it takes lots of patience and persistence. I just didn't realize how slow this process is and I'm emotionally adjusting my expectations. I may be dealing with some control and perfectionist tendencies, I will admit!! This weight goal of 130 just feels like it's never going to come. And I'm afraid I'll lose the insurance authorization before I get there. 

I'm sure many of you have gone through this and I would love to hear how you stayed the course mentally toward this long-term goal. I continue to be amazed at those of you wrapping up a year or more and the transformations.

Do you see anything I'm doing wrong? I would love to lose 2 pounds a week consistently, while working out consistently and building muscle.

Were any of you able to lose 2 pounds per week consistently, while also lifting weights? and if so, how did you crack the code?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts you'd like to share!! I am grateful for this group. ",1,1742686782.0,Zepbound,0,0.99,False

The artisan ethnique (to me) has more of a spiciness and more of a coffee note which I feel is lacking from the qahwa although they do have some similar notes overall. Do you feel that these two are similar enough to warrant owning just the kamrah qahwa? I'm fine with owning one sweet scent only. Also, if I end up selling the qahwa, where would you personally sell it through? Mercari, Etsy etc. ",1,1742686429.0,fragranceclones,3,1.0,False

Do I see myself successful? Well, I've had hope for the longest time that I would be rich from the social media content but I'm starting to lose hope. Where do I see myself in 5 years? Well I see myself with a terminal cancer diagnosis and maybe sick and dying.¬†



I feel like my brain is constantly inflamed - maybe a brain cancer diagnosis. Or esophageal cancer or stomach cancer diagnosis - from the coffee and eoe. Or a toe cancer diagnosis - from the running. Or a skin cancer diagnosis. I see myself with a terminal cancer diagnosis and being on my deathbed.



Somebody said that's hypochondriasis, Andrew. Think of your mother. I'm 37 years old and for the past 37 years she's been on her ""deathbed."" And she's healthy at like 67 years old. Basically, her whole life she was sick. Her whole life she claimed she was dying of cancer or some terminal illness. And she's relatively healthy at 67 years old. Try to realize it's probably catastrophizing. It's probably hypochondriasis. Try to realize there's no evidence I have cancer or I'm going to develop cancer any time soon. It's like my mother who's been sick with cancer my whole life. Meanwhile, she doesn't have cancer.



Ironically, the person who never catastrophized, the person who wasn't a hypochondriac - my father - he's actually diagnosed with cancer. He never really worried about it.

It goes to show, my mother always claimed she would never make old bones, and here she is making old bones.¬†

Pleasantly shocked, but still shocked nontheless.


My advice I am seeking is those who you who started out as friends before becoming more intimate, what were the clues/hints to where it became obvious something was there? I have a friend I am extremely close with that who I have thought of as a sister I never had. We went through school together, often studying late at night together. Not a single hint, she knew my wife and never gave any hints about anything else. The most we would do is kiss on the cheek but that is normal in her culture. 


We started meeting for coffee once a week in preparation for recertification of our professional license and the dynamic is...different. She is married now. There has been substantially less studying going on at our weekly meets(which are public) and more discussion about our unhappy marriages and life in general. We both discussed traveling together one weekend, which was discussed in the past as a group trip with people we know, but I realized this time we never discussed who was traveling in the group. I directly asked her last week if she had planned for others to join us or made an effort to ask others yet. She confessed she had not asked anyone. I then pointed out that I had booked only a single room so far and one room with 1 bed. She simply smiled back and stated ""so what, you wanna sleep on the floor?"" 


We then spoke for about an hour about ""hypothetical situations"" which were essentially parallels to ourselves. We discussed the secrecy aspects, the family aspects, and the fact when relationships such as these form it will be impossible to forget. None of it seemed to phase her. We ended the hypothetical discussion by stating no matter what people should not rush into anything.
During our conversation I realized that she has been dressing herself up a bit more than usual during our meets. She's normally quite modest but I noted this meet today she wore a shirt with a chest zipper that was zipped down  just enough to give a hint of her cleavage. I'm almost confident too she was wearing some form of push-up bra because I also never have seen her boobs pop out from her chest before. She has been touching much more so than in the past during our meets too, using any excuse in our conversations to touch my arm, hand or knee.


I'm truthfully stunned/intimidated at the depth of my feelings for her but we are now substantially closer emotionally than we have ever been and I feel much more attracted to her than I ever have in the past. It's a powerful connection and she has confessed our relationship feels the same way to her. The only tests I have thought to try was return more touch during conversations and, again, bringing up the potential on our trip to be in a hotel room alone together. She's not rebuked either of these. I then had a virtual meeting I needed to attend and she sat next to me in silence for the next hour...just to have another 5 minute talk about meeting up next week.


Can anyone give me advice from their own experiences? My gut tells me these are hints/testing the waters, but part of me thinks she could also just be being a really good friend to me. I never really was great with dating and reading clues growing up and I married quite young so my dating experience is very very limited. My plan is to, very carefully, just let things play out right now and see what happens. Does anyone have any similar stories they feel comfortable sharing? 


I also just want to give a shout out to this sub. It's not often to find a(relatively) non-judgmental place to seek advice and I am thankful for all of you.",2,1742685724.0,adultery,2,0.75,False

coming to Houston i was so excited for the food but now that i'm back home it's like. wow. Houston is trash when it comes to food and it's ridiculous. my guess is that bc the produce sucks. this is ofc a generalization as i do know individual restaurants that're really well done and i would LOVE to know where they source their ingredients from. but i can't be the only dual elite that feels this way.

for how big the city is and the sheer amount of restaurants, it feels like 90% are a waste of time/money (Texas culture is disgusting). what does a girl have to do to get fresh, hot, nutritious, healthy meals from a variety of cultures. in CA, particularly norcal, almost every asian and hispanic place (the two biggest ethnic groups in both TX and CA) are at the very least good enough. Houston has millions of restaurants and cafes and most are trash. like don't even get me started on all the random cafes with shitty coffee and syrups.

are Houstonians allergic to healthy food? what's going on? this is a bad look for America tbh. our greatest city shouldn't have such bad food options.

Recently we‚Äôve been discussing relativity in physics. The teacher has given us a few assignments to do. I‚Äôve tried to do them but I don‚Äôt really understand what I‚Äôm doing incorrectly, and he hasn‚Äôt explained it either.

The questions(translated);
Question 1: The coffee break in Space.
Sven travels with a speed of v = 0,2828 c through space. Control station on earth (which we assume to be stationary) allows him to take a break. They give him 15,0 minutes for this.
(1) Calculate in how much time in his system Sven has to drink his coffee to abide by the given time from control station.
(2) his coffee mug is observed to be 11,3cm high from the control station. Calculate the height which Sven measures his cup to be on his space station.

My answers:
(1) gamma = 1/square root(1 - (v^2 / c^2)
= 1/square root (1- 0,2828^2)
gamma = 1,042‚Ä¶ 

15/1,042..
= 14,38 minutes. 
I assumed this was correct, since observing from earth, the time on his clock is ticking more slowly in comparison with the clock on earth. So if earth gives him 15 minutes to complete a task, he has to execute this faster, so that they observe his clock to have done it in 15 minutes anyways.

Now my professor told me(without explanation) that its 15*1,042 and not 15/1,042. And I can‚Äôt understand that at all. That would mean it takes him 15> minutes. But if earth observes his clock to be ticking more slowly, that would mean it takes him even longer, observed from earth. What am I missing?

(2) (he said there was two possibilities here, one explaining why it stays the same, or the other one to calculate a different answer) i did the following:
Observed height: 11,3cm 
Gamma = 1,042‚Ä¶
Measured height (by Sven): 11,3 * 1,042..
Measured height ‚âà 11,78cm
Again, my professor is saying I did the opposite, and that I should‚Äôve divided instead of multiply. But I really don‚Äôt understand why and he did not give any explanation. :(

I‚Äôd appreciate the correct answers and more importantly an explanation so I can understand it better.

Much appreciated!!

# Going Back to the Double ‚ÄúR‚Äù

# Revisiting Twin Peaks and Its Lasting Impact on Television

By¬†[Mark Slade](https://www.screamingeyepress.com/profile/mark-slade/)

What happens to a small town when the Homecoming Queen is murdered? If it is a David Lynch film, all kinds of strange and kooky things happen.

With the news of David Lynch and Mark Frost bringing back¬†Twin Peaks¬†for Showtime, I couldn‚Äôt help traveling back to 1990 and watching the pilot episode. It‚Äôs not horror, you say? I beg to differ. Wasn‚Äôt¬†Twin Peaks¬†just a fad and a soap opera? Yes, and yes. It did last about as long as a wart on Lynch‚Äôs ass, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it was any less brilliant, weird, and it helped shape TV that exists today. But let‚Äôs dip back into the Double R for a cup of coffee and a damn good piece of pie so I can prove to you that¬†Twin Peaks¬†was much more than a fad and a soap opera. More importantly, it was a great piece of horror captured on film.

It opens with that iconic first scene. Josie Packard (Joan Chen) humming to herself, applying black lipstick to her lips while enjoying her own visage in the mirror. Josie owns the lumber mill in Twin Peaks and lives with Pete (Jack Nance) and Pete‚Äôs wife Katherine (Piper Laurie) (who was Josie‚Äôs very wealthy husband). Pete is up early to go fishing. In just one instant, we can tell this marriage between Pete and Katherine is a loveless one. The stern look she gives Pete when he playfully touches her cheek is all the info the audience needs. Just as Pete is walking along the beach to his pier, he sees something by the water. Something wrapped in plastic. He gets a little closer before he realizes it is a body wrapped in that plastic, and it‚Äôs a woman. Furthermore, Pete knows who the woman is.  
‚ÄúHarry,‚Äù Pete says into the phone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Pete Martell‚Ä¶she‚Äôs dead‚Ä¶‚Äù

There are scenes with Bobby Briggs in the Double R, chatting up Shelley (M√§dchen Amick) and Norma (Peggy Lipton), the owner of the caf√©, but Bobby is supposed to be at football practice. Instead, he is there to carry on his affair with Shelley while her boyfriend Leo is on the road. He takes her home, and they see Leo‚Äôs truck in the driveway. In the meantime, Laura‚Äôs mother (Grace Zabriskie) discovers Laura isn‚Äôt home and desperately calls Bobby‚Äôs parents. They decide Laura must be with her father, Leland Palmer (the prodigious Ray Wise). The scene shifts again back to the beach where the body is, and Sheriff Harry S. Truman (played by Michael Ontkean), a Deputy Andy (Harry Goaz), and Doctor Hayward (Warren Frost), Donna‚Äôs father, are examining the body. Deputy Andy is supposed to take pictures, but emotions get the better of him and he has a problem with breaking into tears any time he is faced with a dead body. They turn the dead girl over and, of course, it is Laura Palmer (that iconic image and sad music in the background has made this clip infamous‚ÄîSheryl Lee wrapped in plastic with beads of sand on her forehead).

News of her death travels fast. At school, people weep with heavy hearts (especially the principal), except her boyfriend, Bobby, who is hauled into the station for questioning. They learn that another high school student, Ronette Pulaski, is also missing. Sheriff Truman has a case on his hands bigger than he expected. The mill shuts down because of the terrible news, in spite of co-owner Katherine‚Äôs gripes.

The scene shifts again and Ronette Pulaski is found walking across a bridge and train tracks. The girl is bruised and bloodied, her clothes torn, and from her wrists dangle threadbare ropes. She‚Äôd obviously been tortured.

Now we cut to motorcycle bad boy‚Äìgood guy James (James Marshall) and his Uncle Ed (Everett McGill) at Ed‚Äôs gas station. The conversation is minimal and to the point. ‚ÄúLaura is dead,‚Äù James says. Ed quips, ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶I heard.‚Äù The conversation is interrupted by Ed‚Äôs not-so-sane wife Nadine, who also wears a patch over her eye. ‚ÄúEd! They said those drapes would be ready by 10 a.m.! I want those drapes hung by nightfall!‚Äù All through the pilot and first season, Nadine (Wendy Robie) is obsessed with discovering noiseless drape runners.

Now enters the most famous and main character of the series: Special FBI Agent Dale B. Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan). Riding along a winding road in his rented car, Cooper talks incessantly into a tape recorder to his secretary (?) Diane. He tells the tape recorder what he had for lunch, the price of it, and of course (another running gag in the series) ‚ÄúCherry pie. Damn good cherry pie.‚Äù

Next, Sheriff Truman and Cooper see Ronette in the hospital. Apparently, this became a case for the FBI because Ronette had walked from outside the Canadian border back into American soil. Ronette is suffering from shock. It appears that she was raped several times. It turns out the only connection between Laura and Ronette was that they were in the same high school. Not being able to question Ronette because of possible neurological damage, Cooper examines her fingernails. Ronette begins to talk while unconscious. She whispers, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go in there‚Ä¶don‚Äôt go in there‚Ä¶‚Äù

The one-armed man shows up in the hallway of the hospital while Cooper and Truman are waiting for the elevator to go to the morgue. As does kooky Dr. Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), Laura‚Äôs psychologist. Jacoby reveals that Laura‚Äôs parents didn‚Äôt know she was seeing him as her patient. Right away, Cooper suspects Jacoby. In the morgue, the lights start to flicker as Cooper examines Laura‚Äôs body. Cooper discovers something under her fingernails and asks the M.E. to leave the room. In strict confidence, he shares his findings with Truman. Under the ring finger, the killer left the letter ‚ÄúR.‚Äù

Cooper reads Laura‚Äôs diary. She mentions she hates asparagus and wonders: ‚ÄúDoes that mean I will never grow up?‚Äù The last entry reads, nervous about meeting ‚ÄúJ‚Äù tonight. He also discovers white residue on the diary and a key to a deposit box. The residue is more than likely cocaine.

A weepy Deputy Andy calls in to say they found the location of the crime, where Laura and Ronette were tortured: an abandoned train car. He also tells the operator to tell Truman he didn‚Äôt cry.

During the interview with Bobby, we come across the golden eye of the film, the pearl. There was a video of Laura while she was alive. She and her best friend Donna are having a picnic with the mysterious ‚ÄúJ.‚Äù Bobby didn‚Äôt shoot that video. The camera pans in very close to Laura‚Äôs eyes. There in the pupil is the reflection of a motorcycle. The ‚ÄúJ‚Äù is the bad-boy good-guy James. Cooper sees it, and so does Bobby.

For the sake of space here, I‚Äôll have to cut some characters (Twin Peaks¬†has so many characters, it‚Äôs not funny). But some have become closely connected to the show. Albert (who doesn‚Äôt appear in the pilot, but in the next few episodes, is played by Miguel Ferrer), the FBI‚Äôs pathologist; Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), who owns the Great Northern Lodge and is Leland‚Äôs business partner; and there is Hawk (Michael Horse), the American Native deputy. There‚Äôs also Audrey Horne, Ben‚Äôs daughter, who ends up being a prominent character in the show, and it made Sherilyn Fenn a star. Another figure from the show that seeped into pop culture is the Log Lady (Catherine Coulson). Supposedly, David Lynch invented this character while filming¬†Eraserhead.

At the abandoned train car, Cooper and Truman see the dank and dark area is covered in blood. There are pieces of plastic with what looks to be (I could be wrong) torture devices wrapped up and possibly flesh. There is also part of a heart locket lying in a mound of dirt. Below that is a torn piece of newsprint with a message written in blood: ‚ÄúFire‚Äîwalk with me‚Ä¶‚Äù

Twin Peaks¬†has just as many scenes of kookiness as there are bizarre and poignant ones‚Äîsad and frightening. The kooky one that stands out, which isn‚Äôt as iconic, is with Ben‚Äôs other child‚Äîthe mentally challenged young man Johnny. Johnny is wearing an Indian chief outfit, banging his head continuously on a dollhouse. You see, Laura was his tutor. Johnny doesn‚Äôt understand that Laura will never tutor him again. This character would have been great to explore. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, Johnny made his only appearance in the pilot film.

Inside the deposit box, Cooper and Truman find ten thousand dollars and a dirty magazine. There is a page marked, and they find a picture of Ronette Pulaski circled. Below that is a blurry picture of Leo‚Äôs semi, with someone standing in front of it. Leo finds two different brands of cigarettes in an ashtray. He questions Shelly and threatens her. The phone rings at Ed‚Äôs gas station. Ed answers, and Norma is on the line. Apparently they are seeing each other in secret.

There was a lot of that in the show. That was the soap-opera aspect of the show. Nevertheless, this was a David Lynch show. The finish of this film is the horror aspect.

Laura‚Äôs mother is lying on the couch, dozing, when she sees a vision of hands digging in the ground to take the gold locket that James and Donna had buried.

The character of Bob, who as the series moves on, is evil embodied. He has such a strong presence that he can push people, from a spirit point of view, into doing horrible things. However, Bob does not appear in the American telecast of the pilot, and the actual vision Laura‚Äôs mother sees is of Bob in Laura‚Äôs room. That footage was used for Episode 2 and the original ending to the European version. Set decorator Frank Silva played Bob in the show. Lynch has said there was a mistake when Silva was caught on film. When he viewed the rushes, Bob was created, and it seemed all the pieces fell in place to make a different kind of TV series that to this day networks still try to recapture. Just think: If ABC had not taken a chance on¬†Twin Peaks, there would be no¬†Seinfeld¬†(a quirky sitcom), no¬†Breaking Bad¬†(main character is a meth dealer), no¬†X-Files¬†(quirky, supernatural, alien-related stories), and the rip-offs such as¬†Picket Fences¬†and¬†Northern Exposure¬†(both of which lasted longer than¬†Twin Peaks).

Lynch made¬†Fire Walk with Me, the sequel feature film, without Frost (not sure why that happened). That film is typical weird Lynch, but no less a decent film. I‚Äôm always curious to see the deleted footage from that. I‚Äôm not sure anyone in their right mind would have sat through a five-hour film of¬†Twin Peaks. Maybe Mark Frost was somewhat Lynch‚Äôs editor in script stages, possibly a better film would have transpired. Who knows? Now, in 2016, Kyle MacLachlan will be back, along with Sheryl Lee and Ray Wise, and Sherilyn Fenn. I‚Äôm sure most of the cast will appear in Showtime‚Äôs ‚ÄúThird Season.‚Äù I have to say, I can‚Äôt wait.

1jhleyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1jhleyj/back_in_september_2023/,Back in September 2023,"TLDR:   

I feel like many people start to struggle at Level 4, and that was certainly my experience.  So here's what I wrote a year and a half ago, but was too self conscious to post.  It's long and whiny, but if you need to commiserate, here you go!  If you need something to look forward to, here's my [Level 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/s/XSa1vTks4k) update.  :)   

Long Form:

I never posted a level 1, 2 or 3 update.  So now that I'm 400 hours in, here‚Äôs a brief history of my language learning journey.

‚Ä¢	I took 2 years of Spanish in high school (about 20 years ago).
‚Ä¢	I used a few phrases at work for a year here and a year there.  I had a humbling experience 18 years ago trying to speak with the parent of one of my students over the phone and realized knowing a bunch of nouns does not mean I speak Spanish.

Fast forward to a year ago, September 2022.  I teach first grade.  I had, for the first time, 2 students who spoke no English on their first day of school.  One spoke Spanish and the other spoke Portuguese.  Now, of course my job is to teach them English (and everything else) not to learn their languages.  I can‚Äôt say that communicating with them was my only reason for deciding to go back to my studies.  But I am almost certain that I wouldn‚Äôt have started in October 2022 if I hadn‚Äôt met them.  

There were other reasons for learning.  One was that I really needed a hobby.  I had others (drawing, crochet) but this was exercising a different ‚Äúmuscle.‚Äù  I was good at word games (Wordle and a bunch of others) but I dropped all of them once I got the idea to learn a language.  

Another reason to was that I was a bit jealous hearing about people who took up hobbies during the pandemic.  In April 2020 I was in survival mode, dealing with a death in the family and mental health problems of another family member.  Not to mention teaching during the pandemic felt like being a first year teacher all over again, except I couldn‚Äôt ask a veteran teacher for help because none of them had ever taught during a pandemic either.  So once things calmed down, I decided to invest in something I could enjoy.   

But as I said, my students were my biggest motivation.  I wanted them to watch me making the effort.  I was part of the community learners as a teacher AND as a learner.  I modeled for them that I would make mistakes in pronunciation but keep on trying (I often said, ‚ÄúNecicito practicar erre, y necesitas practicar th. ‚Ä¶ No me miras asi.‚Äù).  I‚Äôd self-correct conjugations and keep my head up.  And it was amazing.  I was developing more patience than ever for students who struggled because I was living the struggle with them every day.  I understood which sounds (especially for the Spanish speaker) were very different, and therefore going to develop later for her, because there were some sounds in Spanish that I just didn‚Äôt have yet.  

That‚Äôs my why.  Here‚Äôs my how:

I started with Babbel!  I know that‚Äôs not what you want to hear in a CI program, but I didn‚Äôt know any better and I enjoyed it for months.  I was remembering lots of words.  Then all at once I hit a wall.  The difficulty level took a steep turn, and I didn‚Äôt understand the grammatical structures.  I ‚Äúfinished‚Äù the program; no more lessons, but as you could guess, I wasn‚Äôt understanding or speaking with fluency to my student.  I knew I needed more.  I started reading graded readers and using flashcards, but I knew my listening was still a huge weakness.  I could read phonetically in Spanish pretty well, but it was clear that I wasn‚Äôt used to the sounds of the language when my student was speaking (the app would type out what she said in Spanish, I‚Äôd see the printed word before the app translated it, and I‚Äôd say ‚ÄúOh!  I know that word!‚Äù).  So I started looking at videos on YouTube to help with grammar so I could hear, and that‚Äôs around the time I found DS.  

I sort of dabbled with DS between late February and early April, not watching every day and only about 15 minutes per day.  I was still doing flashcards and grammar study and didn‚Äôt have the stamina for more than 15 minutes of listening then.  Since I‚Äôd had some experience with Spanish I skipped right over Superbeginner.  Actually, I started at intermediate but after less than 5 minutes I knew I wasn‚Äôt getting much out of it (even before I read the FAQ).  Beginner mostly felt like the right level for me, and I definitely made progress.  I followed the roadmap and switched over to intermediate when I was supposed to.  Some were really difficult, so I watched more of Pablo than anyone else until I found this subreddit that said to sort from old to new.  That helped a lot.  In April I started averaging an hour on weekdays and more on weekends.  Over the summer I averaged over 2 hours per day.  I wanted to reach level 4 so badly!  300 hours felt like it was going to be a huge accomplishment!   When I realized I was going to reach it before the end of summer vacation I was so excited.  That date was getting closer and closer.

But that also meant that the end of my summer vacation was getting closer and closer.

That started to mess with my head a bit.  Both looking forward to, and dreading, each passing hour.  This was supposed to be an enjoyable hobby...at what point does it become an unhealthy obsession?  

And when I reached 300 hours (8/10), what did I get?  A purple bar on my screen.  No definitive jump in my comprehension (it‚Äôs all poco a poco).  No new content unlocked.  I finished the ‚ÄúPablo in the Park‚Äù series, and now have lots of new guides (unfamiliar speakers are great practice, of course, but intimidating).  

And to make things more difficult, my students who motivated me to learn, were of course, not going to be in my class again this year.  I wouldn‚Äôt have any English language learners this year.  

So if it‚Äôs not helping my mental health, and it‚Äôs not helping my students, where is my motivation to keep going?

This is why I didn‚Äôt post at 300 hours.  It was a low point in my journey.  I was low on motivation and with back to school season starting I was low on time.

So how did I reach 400 hours just 6 weeks later?  

1.	I remind myself that there is no pressure.  I can set my daily goal for a half hour if I get too busy.  I don‚Äôt have to do an hour (but I have, lol).  
2.	I remind myself that this is a healthy habit.  I start my day and end my day listening to Spanish.  Habits are hard to break, so it‚Äôs almost easier to just carry on than to find something else to fill my time.  
3.	Focus on the positive:  Yes, I used a lot of my summer vacation to listen to Spanish.  But I did pull myself away to visit family, watch a few films with my husband, get a coffee with friends, and go out on my own every week.  I found balance before, I would find a balance with work too.  
4.	Plan.  I‚Äôve stopped flashcards and reading in Spanish to free up time to watch videos at home.  I also looked at suggestions on podcasts for intermediate learners.  Now that I have some (and I understand how to use my player properly) I am able to listen during my commute.  That‚Äôs nearly an hour right there!  Couple that with listening while getting ready in the morning and I‚Äôm good.  Watching DS with breakfast and then in the evening if I have time has put me at close to 2 hours every workday.  Which means I‚Äôm crushing that goal of an hour each day.
5.	Think long term.  My listening has come really far in just 7 months.  Sure, I have no Spanish speaking students this year.  But if I do next year, I should be able to understand them without using a translation app.  Maybe the year after I might not need a translator for parent teacher conferences.  And in a few years I‚Äôll start over and finally learn Portuguese (with pure CI; I don‚Äôt know the first thing about reading it yet).  I have to stick with it!  
6.	Think short term.  400 hours feels good.  And yet another 200 hours of intermediate (and another 400 after that, and another 500 after that) feels like a long haul.  So I set small goals in my phone.  My goal is an hour a day.  So I ask Google, ‚ÄúWhat day will it be in 50 days?‚Äù  I put in my phone, ‚ÄúCan I reach 450 hours of Spanish?‚Äù on that date.  When I beat that goal, I enter the accomplishment in my phone too.  Then when I‚Äôm feeling stuck I can search for the word ‚ÄúSpanish‚Äù on my phone and see how my time is accumulating quickly when it doesn‚Äôt feel that way in the moment.  

So that‚Äôs why I say I‚Äôm not a CI purist.  I did lots of things WRONG, even in the past year.  I learned to read phonetically before I was used to hearing the sounds.  I tried speaking a bit well before I was meant to.  But I can‚Äôt undo what‚Äôs done; I just have to carry on.  

It‚Äôs obvious to me that I‚Äôve made progress over the past 11 months, so I‚Äôm still really enjoying this process and plan to continue.  I do worry a little that I‚Äôve overinflated my hours.  I count almost all the podcast time I‚Äôve put in and I almost always push through and watch a video in its entirety even when my comprehension is at a questionable level.  I know I‚Äôm only cheating myself doing it.  So I do expect that when the roadmap says I‚Äôm ready for Intermediate/Advanced content, I‚Äôm going to need to stay Intermediate for a bit longer.  I actually have done a bit of backtracking, watching 10% superbeginner or beginner content and 90% intermediate content each day until I the completed SB/B videos.  I hope that evens things out.  I like to think that my journey may not be the most efficient, but I‚Äôll get there in the end and enjoy myself along the way.

If true i was thinking of bringing a portable electric stove and just cooking for myself, if allowed. ;)

now that i think about it do they check belongings on arrival, and are there any restrictions of what u can bring other than the obvious alcohol, cigs, drugs? Im also a music nerd, i love live music. do they let 17 year olds into any live bars/bistros and are there any known busking areas?

Finally if there is anything specific like fun places you visited or explored in your free time that you recommend (other than the obvious landmarks, looking for more local things teenagers do in the area) id really appreciate it.",1,1742684803.0,exploreprogram,0,1.0,False

1jhl79i,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jhl79i/my_big_break/,My big break.,"Have really been trying my hardest of late to tap into important memories, especially the ones from longer back. Because I forget all that stuff. It‚Äôs been and gone. I‚Äôm striving for wellness. But I feel like this matters. And that I should share. It was 2020. I had settled into my nice new flat, first night after I‚Äôd put up all my wall art I treated myself to a pot noodle. Fair enough. Time goes by. University work to do. Social life to manage. Job on the side. Had some friends round for my birthday and again for Halloween. Smoked some weed. Listened to music. Cleaned my kitchen. I remember that year I think the majority of food I bought was the Activia yogurts because I knew them to be healthy. I didn‚Äôt realise they‚Äôre a natural laxative I was going to the toilet like nobody‚Äôs business (yet I still continue to buy them). Anyway. As time went on I was becoming increasingly withdrawn. I wasn‚Äôt opening the curtains. I wasn‚Äôt seeing anyone. I was lying in bed. My mental health had taken a turn for the worst. Then it got worse. One night I heard a calamity of noise outside. It was a man whose voice I recognised and who I think was/were his friends but hadn‚Äôt seen in some time. I was scared to go out to speak to him. I fancied him. But I had extreme performance anxiety that night so I left it alone. Much to my disheartenment later. I hoped he‚Äôd come back. And so I left a coffee cup outside urging him to use the doorbell when he next was there hoping he‚Äôd use it. And he did. The boy had meant to speak to me. I confessed this to my friend that a boy i fancied was visiting the house I think he had meant to speak to me but she said that he liked ‚ÄúOasis‚Äù and I needed to leave him in the past. I was leaving cups outside like nobody‚Äôs business but it seemed that every time I went outside he had left and we‚Äôd missed each other. I was torn up. I decided I had to shake this bad mental health streak and venture into town. I felt everyone‚Äôs conversation digging into me like it was all about me. The dude‚Äôs voice echoed all in my head and around the shops I was so annoyed. Why couldn‚Äôt I get hold of him? I decided enough was enough. I returned to the flat but not before placing another coffee cup at the door. This time he would see it. I sat outside with the coffee cup to allow him to come to me. This was a safe space. He could talk to me. An hour or 2 hours passed I had given up. I raced upstairs. And the doorbell went I was FURIOUS. Ding Dong dashing my house. What was he playing at??!! I went downstairs to the floor below (it was a towering 3 floored flat with stone stairs that echoed) to see if this has been disrupting the girls who I had met earlier in the year who were also moving in. I apologised for the doorbell sounds on the guys behalf and says I was trying to get in touch with him I didn‚Äôt know what he was playing at!! They said they hadn‚Äôt heard anything. I was so confused was I making stuff up?? Perhaps it was a different floor he was ringing. There were various parties going on along our street on various occasions. I had decided enough was enough. I was sick of this dude. I phoned my mum and told her I was coming back home for a while. I packed my bag for going home and walked with purpose to the bus station. I got settled onto the bus. Then he started talking to me.

He told me he doesn't want ""my kind"" here and told me basically leave or he's going to bash me to death with his stick in my sleep took a couple swings at me hahaha 

He was just some random 9-5er...I had a video of him and was going to post it on my profile that has crazy motion and I was going to send it to my contacts at the news and ruin this guy's life....I decided not to at the last second because I didn't want to stoop to his level.

I'm sober, I don't lie, cheat or steal. I'm just a business guy who takes the money he would spend on rent and gives it out around the community for free....so like I give away 90% of what I earn and keep 10% (it's a whole thing with my religion and I see it as God's work) , it doesn't allow for me to pay 3000$ rent when the weather is nice, I only rent a place in the cold months.

Now I'm not posting this to bring attention to the guy and I won't post the video that shows his face but I'm posting in hopes that someone has heard the story from him and can explain to him that this is me.

And at anytime instead of resorting to violence or harassment he can message me or come to me and I'll buy him a coffee...
