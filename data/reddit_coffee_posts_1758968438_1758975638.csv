I do OMAD but have always had 1 coffee with some milk mainly because I take medication that makes me feel very sick on an empty stomach and the milky coffee seems to help prevent that. I've been listening to a really interesting pod cast on fasting and the science behind it as well as the heaps of benefits and how the longer you fast the more benefits there are. I have always just focused on weightloss. So it got me thinking that the coffee will be preventing those benefits because it breaks the pure fast. I drink water but wondered with this in mind, would sugar free drinks also break the fasting state or would they be ok? Do you consume only water or drinks that are sugar free too?",1,1758975433.0,omad,0,1.0,False
1nrtq8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nrtq8b/i_wont_let_my_ex_see_my_kids/,I won't let my ex see my kids,"Ok, so for a bit of context - me (25f) and my ex (24f) started dating in uni, we were doing the same degree so had mainly the same classes, It started with her chatting to me after class then studying in my dorm and going for coffees in the morning. Uni was pretty stressful for us both so it was nice to have someone to chat to in the mornings, eat breakfast with, head down to class with and have the odd drink with in the evenings. I was really glad to have her as a friend but when we started dating it got weird. she sort of changed and began randomly bursting into my dorm with out knocking, she said she'd been cheated on before so had trust issues. I told her I was wideband it's fine but she had to stop doing it, we'd been eating 2 weeks. She apologised and promised to work on it.

everything seemed to go smoothly for a while after that, we acted pretty much as before just with a bit of kissing and she was sweet, she always listened to me and did nice things like make me breakfast and bake me cookies on hard study days, she was there for me. Then I noticed the little cracks in our relationship. When my friends from secondary school came to visit, she acted cold towards them and kept making snide comments and hinting that I didn't like them anymore, I eventually pulled her aside and told her she had to stop. She apologised that she upset me but said she hadn't done anything, I let it go and decided to speak to her later if it continued, when we were alone.

Then on the way to class I told her we were going to a concert, me and my friends. She let go of my hand and began saying that I was choosing them over her, and that we had plans that I was blowing off. I said I didn't know we had plans, and that I hadn't seen my friends in months as they have jobs or go to a different uni. I also invited her, saying ""you can come, if you're free and don't need to study."" Then She said I obviously was trying to hint that I didn't want her to come. I wasnt, but she was really upset with me and close to crying.

a few months later I realised that her clinginess was getting w orse, she went everywhere with me and even refused to be without me for a few days at christmas. I didn't feel that attracted to her anymore and found myself feeling attracted to more and more people who weren't her and wishing I could ask them out. I can't  continue a relationship where I do not feel loyal to someone anymore, that isn't fair on either of us. So I sent her a text.

the ne xt morning she was at my door, the first thing she did was kiss me, I broke the kiss and asked her what she was doing, she looked at me blankly. ""The text."" My phone said she' d read it but she claimed she hadn't then when she saw it on my phone laughed, calling me her 'favourite premier's

I told her to leave, the next day she was back. I didn't open the door and she began crying, waiting outside my door for me to come out. Honestly, it was wrong of me and I know that but I have every class with this girl and I didn't want things to get messy, so I opened the door, I couldn't hide inside forever. So yes, I let her think we were still dating  for the last 2 weeks of finals before I graduated, but mainly ignored her saying I was busy studying, I knew I wanted to break up with her but i wasn't sure yet.

When I graduated my Mum helped me pay for a new place, I didn't have much contact with my gf for around a week and realised I didn't miss her, not at all. She wasn't the one I was going to marry. I sent her a text letting her know we weren't dating anymore. We'd been better as friends, she had been less dependant on me and it felt more normal. I had liked chatting and laughing with her. She ignored me for 2 weeks the n texted me saying she understood and wanted to stay friends.

I have always w anted children, so when I graduated and had some money saved up, I adopted. Being into girls I always knew that I w as going to adopt, but I just didn't feel I needed a partner to do it. My mum was going to help me and this had been a lifelong dream, I had always known I was going to have kids young. So when I turned 25 and all the adoption papers had been sorted, I adopted a baby girl, I posted about my new family on social media and 10 minutes later I received a text fr om my ex. 'how long have you had her?' I felt a bit uncomfortable as we b arely spoke now and hadn't met in person since uni but I told her i 'd had my baby girl a month, I didn't like knowing that she was on my social media, and to see the post so quickly?

Then came the messages asking why I hadn't let her meet the baby yet and what took so long to get in contact and that she was coming round tomorow, she had to meet her. I put it simply. 'you're not meeting her.' But the. I decided to add that she was too young and going through a lot being without her mother, my ex didn't believe a word. She got angry saying that she was my best friend and deserved to see the child. 'you deserve nothing. It s my child.' Again, I putt it simply, then she flipped, she sent me a bunch of voice messages demanding to know when she could see her and I was honest, I said never that she was my child and I didn't feel comfortable with it.

what an said next was insane. She claimed she had a righ t as we had spoken about our future children together and shared baby names, she claimed that I had taken her baby name and that if I didn't want her to be involved why would I use HER baby name. The baby's name was Anna. Named afte r my Mother, anastasia. I had told my ex this name but now she was claiming it and saying it was hers. Then She said the most crazy thing - she said the words 'it's OUR child, we planned it together.' I blocked her.

I know she was incorrect but I feel I may have over-reacted, we only dated for a bit and she WAS my best friend. When I was stressed in uni she baked me cookies, she got me scented candles and got me a hug, took me to a cafe and listened to me. Of course she would be hurt when I told her that she, my best friend could never  child, I knew she had been excited for me, even if I did feel u comfortable. Aita? Sorry it's such a long post, I just feel guilty and am wondering if I should apologise.",1,1758975368.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1nrtpxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1nrtpxq/burnt_out_anxious_overwhelmed_a_clinical/,"Burnt out, anxious, overwhelmed: a clinical psychologist on how to reset when the world feels too heavy","he other day, a client walked into my office looking like he had been holding his breath.

He sat down and said, “I was coming in to talk about something else… but then I heard the news in the car and… I don’t even know where to begin.”

And I knew exactly what he meant.

Because lately, it feels like the world is on fire and our phones are the smoke alarm. 

War. Famine. Assassination. Hate speech. Escalating political violence. Humanitarian crises. A climate crisis. And all of it — graphic, unfiltered, and deeply affecting — is right in front of us. Playing out in our hands, our cars, our living rooms, whether we ask for it or not.

Even when we’re trying to be intentional about our consumption by switching off, muting notifications or reducing scrolling, it sneaks in. At the supermarket. In the doctor’s waiting room. The second we open Instagram. It’s everywhere.

And when it’s everywhere, it’s easy to feel powerless. But we’re not.

We might not be able to control the news cycle. But we can look after our nervous systems in the face of it. And that might just be the most powerful thing we can do right now.

# What actually happens when we see something distressing on our screens

When we see something distressing on our screens, our bodies react like it’s happening right in front of us. Because the nervous system is not great at figuring out what’s real and what’s coming through a screen.

Your heart starts racing. Your muscles tense. Stress hormones kick in. It’s the same ancient survival response that would have saved you from a tiger a few thousand years ago.

But here’s the catch. These days, we don’t get the resolution. We watch something awful… and then scroll straight onto a viral tray bake recipe that promises dinner in 20 minutes. And before we’ve even processed that, we’re hit with the next awful thing.

This survival energy stays trapped in the body, leaving us wired and exhausted all at once. It’s why so many of us find ourselves lying in bed, chest tight, mind spinning, feeling like something’s wrong. Because as far as your body’s concerned, something is wrong. Your body hasn’t realised that you’re safe in your bed, it’s still carrying the threat.

# This is vicarious trauma

In psychology, we talk about something called vicarious trauma. 

It’s what happens when you internalise the distress of someone else’s experience. You’ll often hear about it in frontline workers — journalists, health professionals, therapists, paramedics — people who are regularly exposed to other people’s pain.

But these days, you don’t have to be in a hospital or a war correspondent to feel affected. Now, the frontlines aren’t halfway around the world, they’re in your feed. In your pocket. On autoplay while you’re waiting for your coffee.

Every time you’re exposed to this graphic content, violent videos or heartbreaking headlines, your system keeps score. It leaves a mark. Even if we think we’re fine, our nervous system might be telling a different story.

Over time, this internalising can take a toll. Heightened anxiety, emotional numbing, intrusive imagery, hopelessness. These are all signs that your nervous system is carrying more than it can process. And if we don’t give it an off-ramp, the stress doesn’t go away. It just builds. 

That build-up? It doesn’t mean something’s wrong with you. It means you’re human.

Because if you’re feeling the effects of vicarious trauma, it’s not because you’re too sensitive or not coping well. It’s because you’re empathetically attuned. You feel things. And while that’s one of your greatest strengths, it also means you need to look after yourself.

# Okay… so what can we actually do?

The goal isn’t to stop caring about the world, or to bury your head in the sand. It’s to help your nervous system process what it’s absorbing which will allow you to continue showing up in the world long term rather than your system shutting down. 

These are some simple, science-backed things I share with clients when the weight of the world starts to feel like too much:

# Firstly, please avoid watching videos of shootings 

When I hear that people are watching videos of shootings, it honestly worries me. A lot. I wish it went without saying, but please try to avoid that kind of content if you can. I know the urge to look exists— we want to understand, to witness— but your nervous system pays the price. Resist the scroll. You don’t need that in your body or your brain.

# Limit exposure 

Try to be intentional about how often you check the news. Constant refreshing and doomscrolling keeps your nervous system stuck in high alert mode. Be especially careful with graphic videos— seeing the same distressing footage over and over can really compound the impact. If staying informed matters to you (and of course it does), consider reading a summary instead. Your brain will thank you.

# Name what you’re feeling

Name your emotional response. Say it out loud, or at least to yourself. Something like, “I’m feeling shaken, heartbroken, and confused. I can feel my body is on high alert”. Naming what’s going on helps you take a tiny step back from the overwhelm. It activates your brain’s prefrontal cortex and gives you a sense of distance from the overwhelm. It turns a big, messy feeling into something you can witness… and then soothe.

# Discharge the energy

Discharge the energy. Your body needs to release the stress response. Go for a walk. Shake out your arms. Dance around the kitchen to a song you loved in 2005. Do a few squats in your living room. Punch a pillow if that helps. Grab a stress ball or a fidget toy if that’s more your vibe. The point is, you need to give your body a clear message: the danger has passed. You’re safe now.

# Use your breath

Your breath is one of the quickest ways to calm your nervous system. A long, slow exhale tells your body, you’re okay now. It activates the parasympathetic nervous system—your “rest and digest” mode and helps to lower your heart rate, reduce tension, and bring you back to the present. Try this: breathe in for four counts, out for six. Do it a few times. It’s simple, free, and effective. Like a tiny reset button you carry around all the time.

# Ground yourself in the present

When you feel caught in mental images, come back to the present by noticing five things you can see, four things you can feel, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste.

# Connect with others

Connect. Don’t carry it all on your own. Talking about the heaviness reduces the load your nervous system is carrying alone. And if the distress sticks around for more than a few weeks, or it’s making everyday life feel hard, please reach out for professional support. You don’t need to be in crisis to ask for help. 

The world is heavy right now. But that doesn’t mean you have to carry it all, all the time, all by yourself. You can care deeply and take care of yourself. You can stay informed and protect your peace. And you can start small. With a breath, a walk, a conversation, or simply by putting down your phone. That’s not checking out. It’s choosing to replenish, so that when you do step forward, you can do so with clarity, compassion, and strength.

The vulnerable need our voices, and the world requires wise action. Your care holds the most power when it is sustainable.

The first time was when I had too much coffee when I met my half sister for the first time (I am very food sensitive) and I had horrible stomach pains and really really bad anxiety. I knew this was all from the coffee and I told her that. I went into her bedroom and I told her what was going on, that I didn't feel good and I was incredibly paranoid and anxious. She then went on one of her rants of ""meditation, exercise, drinking water every day"" and I stopped her and I told her that I really didn't need a solution, I just need comfort and her to listen. (FYI I said it in a very normal way) She then blew up and started shouting at me telling me she was ""Just trying to help me"" and proceeding to say that I am miserable and always in a bad mood. This came out of nowhere and I was really confused and hurt by what she said. It happened another time when I was running errands for the household in the mall and when I got home and started cooking, she freaked out when she found out I forgot to buy her chips. Yes, she did remind me, but I was on a time crunch and I had so many things I needed to do that it slipped my mind. Her reaction was insane to someone forgetting to buy freaking LAYS CHIPS. She said I was ""distracted"" and ""miserable"" and she ""thanked god every time I was in a good mood."" I just stood there listening to her waiting to finish and she eventually left while I resumed cooking. She later told me she apparently wasn't upset about the chips and she just wanted to give me ""motherly"" advice.

Now truth be told, sometimes I really struggle to put on a smile around her. She traumatized me a lot throughout my childhood. I truly think she never should have had a child in the first place. She is bipolar so you can imagine the strain with that. I love her, but if I had the money to, I would leave home immediately. She use to scream at me for hours and hours when I was a kid from like the age of 8. She would tell me she wished I had autism because I ""couldn't be this stupid"". Her words. At 13, her ex, my ex step dad was abusive and forced me to take diet pills and extensive exercise before school, around 4:30am.. and after school which would be school sports and crossfit. Just to let you know I was not fat at all. I was a pretty lanky kid. They basically were the worst combo of parents. My mothers unstable emotional state and my step father's narcissistic controlling narrative. It really messed me up. Like a lot. I'm still messed up from it and I'm 21. I have a low self esteem, no discipline, highly strung, paranoid, prone to depression. It use to be really bad. To the point where I would throw up every meal I ate and wouldn't shower for weeks. There was a lot of things they did to me, which would literally turn this post into a book.

I love my mom even though she was a terrible mom. I know she loves me, she's just messed up in her head. She is a lot more docile now after I left home for a long time as well. I think she changed a bit. Not fully though. I don't think she realized how much she affects me. To the original point, I resent her sometimes. Now that we are at least a little stable with money and over a very traumatizing thing that happened to the both of us, it's like my brain has gone out of survival mode and it's gone to pain. All my past memories are haunting me and it's either her or my step father or both. She is the root of all my pain and I really struggle sometimes to be normal around her. I don't know how to change this. I can certainly say I am not miserable around her all the time. But man... she is exhausting to be around with all her constant complaining about the same things over and over again.

I don't know how to be peaceful with this. With her. With myself. If I don't I will literally go insane cukooballs. I need to find a way to just breathe through this. I won't be able to move out for a few years so I have to do something.",1,1758975140.0,therapy,0,1.0,False

Money, time, and attention are all getting squeezed. We open five apps before coffee, chase ideas across tabs, and promise ourselves we will finally build a workflow that sticks. The right AI tool can feel like a skilled teammate. The wrong one can add cost, confusion, and wasted hours. This guide compares the most asked matchups of 2025 so you can make faster, safer picks for real work. Each section breaks down strengths, tradeoffs, and where each tool genuinely helps with examples that map to daily tasks like research, content creation, coding, meetings, and team handoffs. The goal is simple. You should finish each head-to-head knowing exactly which product earns a spot in your stack and why.

# ChatGPT vs Claude - best overall AI assistant for everyday work

If you are choosing a primary AI assistant for daily use across research, writing, planning, and light build tasks, you care about three things. First, answer quality you can trust with citations and reasoning you can follow. Second, productivity features that remove steps like file handling, code explainer mode, structured outputs, and repeatable templates. Third, a plan that fits your budget with controls that your team can actually manage.

**Author Insight: I’m Pratik Thorat, an SEO and AI tools reviewer with 2.5+ years of hands-on industry experience. Most of my work is about testing AI solutions with clear benchmarks and side-by-side comparisons so people don’t just get the marketing pitch, they see how tools perform in real workflows. My goal is to keep things accurate, transparent, and practical so startups and professionals can make smarter choices. I also share and discuss new SEO and AI trends here on Reddit to learn from the community and give back useful insights.**

**Which gives more accurate, cited answers for complex research? \[Plan to embed side-by-side test set and sources\]** For complex topics, your assistant should explain thinking, cite sources clearly, and hold a long thread without dropping earlier context. In hands-on workflows, accuracy shows up in three ways. First, grounded citations that connect claims to a named source. Second, step-by-step reasoning that matches the question’s constraints and avoids hallucinated tools or features. Third, stable follow-up behavior that stays inside the bounds you set, such as tone, audience, or format. A simple test that works across tools is to give each one the same seed prompt and an identical follow-up tree. Example: “Summarize three credible positions on AI watermarking for short-form video, then extract five pros and five cons for small creators, then draft a policy note for a brand using UGC ads.” Collect outputs, score for factual alignment with recognized sources, label where each claim came from, and measure how consistent the tone stays between turns. This turns vague impressions into a repeatable scorecard you can reuse across topics like finance explainers, sales enablement briefs, and risk memos.

**Coding help, file handling, and integrations in real workflows** Your daily assistant becomes sticky when it handles your artifacts without drama. Think of three flows. First, code reading and small fixes where you paste a function, ask for a safer version, and get an answer that compiles. Second, multi-file context where you upload a zip, a docs folder, or a design spec and the model keeps references straight through the session. Third, integrations such as export to Google Docs, Notion, or Markdown with preserved headings and clean lists. Look for features like structured output modes, JSON-safe responses, and template prompts you can pin and reuse. If you write documentation or SOPs, insist on clean tables, bullet hierarchy, and anchor-friendly subheads. If your team lives in docs and wikis, test whether the assistant can map answers into your templates instead of giving a block of prose that you must reformat.

**Pricing, rate limits, privacy, and enterprise controls compared** You should map cost to a weekly plan. Count research hours, content drafts, and coding asks you actually make in a week rather than debating theoretical usage. Price per seat only tells half the story. Rate limits, priority queues during peak hours, and included file sizes can change effective cost. For teams, check SSO, role-based permissions, audit logs, and data retention windows. Ask whether your prompts and files are excluded from model training by default, how deletion works, and whether the vendor offers regional data residency if you operate in finance or health. If you are a solo user, think about reliability and guardrails. A stable assistant with solid citations and predictable formatting can replace two or three smaller subscriptions because it saves editing time. If you are a manager, test admin dashboards for real. Can you see who used what, set sharing policies, and export chat histories for compliance without creating a spreadsheet chore every Friday.

**Personal experience** I switched my weekly research routine to a side-by-side pattern. I run the same brief in two assistants and log answers in a small table. The winner is the one that reduces my editing time, not the one with the flashiest phrasing. Over six weeks, the tool that respected my constraints and handled long files consistently saved me an extra hour per article because I spent less time fixing formatting and more time refining the argument.

**Famous book insight** From *The Checklist Manifesto* by Atul Gawande, Chapter 2, p. 48: simple, explicit checklists reduce errors in complex environments. Your AI evaluation benefits from the same approach. Define your test list once, run it every quarter, and let the results guide renewals and upgrades rather than hype.

# Google Gemini vs Perplexity - search assistant vs answer engine

If your job is to stay current and turn messy questions into clear answers, this matchup matters. One tool is stacked with Google’s ecosystem strengths like Docs, Drive, and YouTube context. The other builds a fast answer layer on top of the web with visible citations that reduce copy-paste chores. Your choice should follow your daily pattern. Do you live inside Google’s stack and want AI to pre-draft docs, slides, and emails from your files. Or do you need a nimble research surface that pulls fresh sources into a clean, quotable summary with fewer clicks.

**Freshness, citations, and reliability for news and live data**

When breaking news hits or policies change, you will feel the gap between a general chatbot and a live web answer engine. Map your needs to three checks. First, citation clarity. A reliable research companion shows exactly where a claim came from, lists multiple sources, and keeps links close to the paragraph that uses them. This makes quote vetting and footnotes faster. Second, update cadence. If you follow earnings calls, product policy pages, or government advisories, you need an assistant that reflects changes within minutes or hours, not days. Test with a real story. Ask for a summary of a fresh regulatory notice and compare time stamps on the cited pages to see how quickly results roll in. Third, conflict handling. Real research includes disagreements. Prompt the tools to present the consensus, minority view, and what data would falsify either position. The system that can frame uncertainty without wavering gives you better meeting notes and safer briefs for stakeholders who care about risk.

Practical workflow

1. Start with a narrow query such as “Changes to platform ad targeting for healthcare brands, August–September 2025.”  
2. Require bulleted claims with source links right beside each point.  
3. Ask for a short section titled “What changed since last month” with links only to pages updated in the last 30 days.  
4. Finish with “What we do not know yet” so you can log open questions for follow-ups.  

**Long queries, multi-step planning, and voice search use cases**

Complex projects start as long questions, not keywords. Test each tool’s ability to hold a chain of thought. For planning, ask for a three-phase rollout plan that includes dependencies, approvals, and draft timelines. Then say “compress to one page with a cost table and a risks section.” The better system will keep constraints intact, preserve headings, and avoid reintroducing items you cut. For voice, speak a natural prompt like “Plan a research sprint to compare privacy controls across meeting tools, and add a checklist my team can run after every update.” The winner will understand intent, chunk steps into actions, and offer export options that travel well into Docs, Notion, or a task app. For long queries with multiple goals, evaluate whether the model decides what to do first. Good systems will split your request into tasks, show a brief plan, and ask clarifying questions only when necessary rather than bouncing you back and forth.

Testing trick Give both tools the same four-step brief: collect sources, cluster claims, generate a comparison table with dates and links, and produce a plain-English summary for a non-technical reader. If you only need a fast overview with links ready for citation, an answer engine that prioritizes inline sources will likely feel faster. If you also need the draft converted into a slide outline or a doc template, a system that sits inside your productivity suite will be more seamless.

**Free vs paid tiers, rate limits, and workspace features**

Cost is more than the sticker price. Your workload has peaks. If you do weekly news roundups or quarterly policy reviews, you need predictable performance during busy windows. Free tiers are useful for casual checks, however paid plans often add higher caps, bigger files, and team features like shared folders, templates, and usage analytics. If you run a content or research team, insist on seat-level controls, data retention settings, and clear policies on whether your prompts are used to improve the model. Workspace features matter when you plan to move from answer to artifact. Look for one-click exports to docs or slides, markdown purity for CMS pasting, and table formatting that survives copy-paste. If you publish frequently, also test whether citations preserve when you paste into your CMS so you do not have to relink sources manually.

Procurement checklist • Data protection: training opt-out, deletion pathways, region options • Admin: SSO, SCIM, audit logs, usage reports • Reliability: stated limits, priority during peak hours, file size caps • Workflow fit: export formats, markdown tables, headings that match your style guide • Budget: compare effective monthly cost at your real query volume, not theoretical maximums

**Personal experience** During a busy week of policy updates, I ran identical “what changed since last week” briefs in both tools and tracked edits in a simple spreadsheet. The tool that surfaced citations beside each bullet cut my verification time in half because I could click, confirm, and move on without opening a second window to hunt for sources. When I needed to turn the summary into slides, the system that lives inside the office suite saved me more time. I ended up using both in sequence. One to gather and cite, the other to package and share.

**Famous book insight** From *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman, Part 2, Chapter 16, p. 231: humans lean on quick intuition under pressure, yet complex decisions improve when we slow down and structure the choice. Your tool selection benefits from a structured test plan that counters snap judgments from a single flashy demo.

# Midjourney vs DALL·E 3 - image generation for marketers and creators

Creative teams care about three things when they brief an image model. First, control. Can you steer style, framing, color, and brand tone without wrestling the prompt. Second, throughput. Can you iterate fast with upscaling, inpainting, and batch generation that feels like a real art pipeline. Third, safety and rights. Do outputs feel brand-safe, and do terms align with commercial use when you actually run ads or package visuals for clients.

**Prompt control, style consistency, and brand-safe outputs**

If you produce ads, landing pages, or social creative, consistency beats one-off luck. Treat prompts like reusable recipes. Build a small “brand prompt kit” that includes palette, lighting, lens, and composition cues. Then test how each model respects those cues across a series of shots such as product close-ups, lifestyle scenes, and text-over-image posts. Look for three signals of control. First, repeatability. Run the same prompt five times and compare small details like edge cleanliness, typography legibility if you add overlaid text later, and color drift. Second, editability. Can you keep the same style while changing angles, backgrounds, or props without starting over. Third, negative prompting. Can you reliably suppress elements you do not want such as extra fingers, glossy reflections, or unwanted logos. Brand safety is the quiet make-or-break. In practical use, you want images that clear review without surprises. Build a checklist for expressions, gestures, backgrounds, and implied claims. Use it on a batch of outputs before you share with stakeholders. The model that needs fewer re-renders is the one that wins time back for copy, layout, and approvals.

**Upscaling, inpainting, batch generation, and rights usage**

An image model becomes a production tool when it handles repairs and fast variations. Upscaling should preserve detail without introducing strange textures. Inpainting should fix small issues like hands, labels, or product seams while staying true to the original scene. Batch generation should let you explore ten or twenty controlled variations in one go so you can A/B test faster. Rights usage matters the moment you move from mood boards to campaigns. Read the current commercial terms, especially for paid plans, and keep a short record of the prompts and steps used to create each final asset. This helps with internal approvals and with platform checks when you run ads. If you collaborate with freelancers, store your prompts and seeds in a shared doc so handoffs do not break the look and feel you worked hard to lock in.

Practical workflow for marketing teams

1. Start with a mood grid: six to nine low-cost drafts to nail tone.  
2. Lock a look: save the winning prompt, seed (if available), and a short “style clause” you will reuse.  
3. Produce a batch: vary angle, background, and crop for each channel (story, reel cover, hero image).  
4. Polish: inpaint tiny flaws, upscale once, and export in your brand’s aspect ratios.  
5. Archive: paste the prompt, seed, and export settings into your asset management notes for easy re-runs.  

**Cost per image, speed, and content policy differences**

Your budget will live at the intersection of volume and speed. If you publish daily, cost per finished asset matters more than per-render price because you will iterate. Track cost per accepted image by counting all the drafts that led to the final pick. A faster model at slightly higher list price can still be cheaper if it reduces the number of retries. Speed is about more than render time. It also includes queue delays during peak hours, the time you spend re-prompting to correct quirks, and the polish step. If a model’s defaults regularly produce clean edges and believable hands, you will save minutes on every shot. Those minutes become hours over a campaign. Content policy differences show up when you work with sensitive categories like health, finance, or kids. Create a small red-flag list aligned to your industry and run a preflight test. The model that gives predictable moderation decisions will avoid late-stage blockers.

**Personal experience** For a product landing page refresh, I built a nine-shot grid for a single hero section: three angles, three scenes. One model nailed lighting and texture out of the box but needed more prompt massaging to hold the same look across all scenes. The other needed a touch more retouching on hands, yet it kept the style consistent as I switched angles. I chose the second because the batch stayed coherent. It cut my design time by a third since I was not fighting subtle drift between images.

**Famous book insight** From *Atomic Habits* by James Clear, Chapter 4, p. 62: small systems beat willpower. A repeatable “style clause” and batch pipeline become your system. They remove friction and turn image generation into a reliable habit that produces on-brand results week after week.

# Runway Gen-3 vs Pika - text-to-video for ads, UGC, and promos

Short video is where brands win attention. If you are making UGC-style ads, explainers, or reels, the model that gives you controllable motion, predictable faces, and clean transitions will save real money. Think like a small studio. You need scene planning, precise edits, and exports that slot straight into your editor without roundtrips.

**Motion quality, coherence, and scene control tools**

Motion is more than movement. You want believable physics, consistent subject identity, and transitions that do not break the viewer’s focus. Start with a storyboard and test the same three shots in both tools: a product hero pan, a lifestyle cutaway, and a CTA slate. Check three things. First, temporal consistency. Does a logo stay crisp across frames. Do hands and props morph. Second, camera language. Can you call for pans, tilts, rack focus, or handheld jitter without wrecking the scene. Third, identity control. If your scene features a person or mascot, does the look stay constant between clips. If you build ads with a lean team, minor glitches turn into edit time. Favor the model that yields fewer artifacts on fast motion and text overlays, because that keeps your render-to-publish window tight.

**Editing workflow: storyboard, keyframes, and timeline features**

Video work is won in planning. A useful model honors your plan instead of improvising. Features like keyframes, reference images, and input control clips make a huge difference. Test a three-beat script: wide establishing shot, mid product action, tight CTA. Then force a specific transition (match cut or whip pan) and see which system hits it with fewer tries. Look for timeline-level edits: trimming clips, replacing a middle segment without regenerating the entire video, and freezing a frame for text callouts. If you post frequently, build a repeatable scene recipe: intro bumper, core demo, proof element, CTA. Save that as a template so anyone on the team can run it for next week’s drop without rebuilding prompts.

**Export formats, licensing, and commercial usage terms**

When the creative is approved, you need clean exports at platform-native sizes: 9:16 for shorts, 1:1 for feed posts, 16:9 for YouTube or site embeds. Test ProRes or high-bitrate H.264/HEVC to avoid banding in gradients. Check audio handling if you plan VO and music stems. Licensing matters when you scale paid spend. Read current commercial terms carefully and keep a quick log of project files, prompts, and dates for approvals. If you collaborate with agencies, standardize on export names and frame rates so the footage drops into their NLE without conversions.

**Personal experience** I ran a three-clip ad set for a skincare product. One model delivered silky camera moves from the first render, yet it sometimes shifted the product label on fast pans. The other gave me slightly plainer motion but held labels, hands, and skin texture steady across edits. I picked the second because the footage graded better and survived compression on shorts without artifacts.

**Famous book insight** From *Made to Stick* by Chip and Dan Heath, Chapter 1, p. 18: clarity beats complexity when you want ideas to spread. A repeatable three-beat video structure gives your message a clear path, which your model should support rather than fight.

# Notion AI vs ClickUp Brain - the AI workspace for docs and projects

These tools live where your team thinks, writes, and ships. The right choice should reduce context switching, turn meeting notes into tasks, and surface answers from past work without you playing search detective.

**Meeting notes, task automation, and AI search across knowledge**

Start with a weekly standup packet. Record raw notes, ask the AI to extract decisions and owners, and push tasks into your board. The stronger system will preserve links to source notes, add due dates, and avoid duplicating tasks that already exist. For retrieval, try a natural query like “show last quarter’s retro decisions that mention onboarding friction” and demand direct links to the original pages. If your workspace spans pages, databases, and files, the AI should resolve names, match people to tasks, and answer in the language of your doc culture, not generic text.

**Templates, databases, and cross-app connectors that matter**

Docs and tasks only scale when you standardize. Test each tool’s AI with your real templates: PRD, launch checklist, QBR deck outline. Ask it to fill fields, summarize old projects into the same shape, and suggest missing sections. Connectors are the hidden lever. If you rely on Drive, Slack, Jira, or GitHub, confirm the AI can reference those artifacts without manual pasting. The best flows let you pull a bug list into a project doc, generate a risk table, and push follow-ups back to tasks in one pass.

**Admin controls, data residency, and SSO/SCIM readiness**

If you operate in a regulated environment, map features to policy. You want SSO, role-based access, workspace export, audit logs, and clear data retention settings. Check whether AI features inherit the same permissions as the underlying pages so private docs do not leak into answers. Ask about region options if your legal team requires data residency in specific jurisdictions.

**Personal experience** I built a “meeting-to-shipping” template where notes become a summary, tasks, and a handoff checklist in one click. The tool that respected my database schema and reused our exact headings won. It cut the time to prep weekly packets from forty minutes to ten because I no longer had to reformat or chase missing fields.

**Famous book insight** From *Deep Work* by Cal Newport, Chapter 2, p. 62: systems that reduce context switching multiply output. Pick the workspace AI that keeps you in flow by turning notes into tasks and tasks into shipped work without leaving the page.

# GitHub Copilot vs Cursor - coding copilots inside your IDE

Developers care about flow. The best copilot anticipates intent, edits safely across files, and reasons over your repo like a teammate who read the docs.

**Autocomplete quality, inline chat, and repo-wide refactors**

Judge by edit distance and compile success, not vibes. Run the same kata in both tools: add a feature, refactor a class, and write a small CLI. The stronger copilot keeps suggestions concise, follows your code style, and lets you accept parts of a block without yanking control. Inline chat should “know” your repo. Ask for a change that touches routes, controller, and tests. The winner will propose a plan, cite the files it will touch, and keep variable naming consistent.

# Test generation, debugging, and multi-file edits at scale

A practical copilot writes tests you actually keep. Measure branch coverage and human edits required before merge. For debugging, ask it to instrument a flaky test and provide a minimal repro. Multi-file edits should come with a preview diff so you can scan changes and roll back safely.

**Model choices, pricing, compliance, and team governance**

Teams need clear guardrails. Check license filters, telemetry controls, and whether prompts are retained for product improvement. For pricing, honestly estimate hours saved per week. A tool that prevents one production issue or cuts your refactor time by a third often pays for itself quickly.

**Personal experience** I used both copilots on a TypeScript API cleanup. One gave longer, sometimes clever suggestions that I trimmed often. The other produced shorter, more idiomatic edits that matched our lint rules. I merged faster with the second, and my review comments dropped by half because the diffs were tight.

**Famous book insight** From *Refactoring* by Martin Fowler, 2nd Edition, Chapter 3, p. 75: small, safe steps keep code healthy. Your copilot should encourage many small correct changes instead of a single risky sweep.

# Slack AI vs Microsoft Teams Copilot - AI inside your work hub

Work happens where people chat. The right assistant summarizes channels, pulls answers from wikis and tickets, and turns chatter into commitments.

**Summaries, daily recaps, and actionable follow-ups across channels**

Run a seven-day test. Ask for daily recaps of two busy channels and DM threads. The useful system links to the exact messages, tags owners, and offers “create task” right from the summary. It should avoid hallucinating decisions by citing the post that triggered each follow-up.

**Knowledge retrieval from files, wikis, and third-party apps**

Your chat hub is only as smart as the connections around it. Try questions that require context from Docs, Drive, Confluence, and tickets. The winning assistant answers with short context plus links, not a wall of text, and it respects permissions so private docs stay private.

**Admin policies, audit logs, and security for regulated teams**

If you work under SOC2, ISO, or HIPAA constraints, map features to auditor questions. You need retention controls, export options, and a clear policy on how AI features handle message histories. Confirm SSO and SCIM work smoothly so joins and leaves do not create permission drift.

**Personal experience** I built a daily recap ritual for a product channel. The system that let me create tasks straight from summary bullets and kept links to the source messages reduced meeting prep time. We stopped spending the first ten minutes catching up and started with decisions.

**Famous book insight** From *Essentialism* by Greg McKeown, Chapter 7, p. 104: eliminate the trivial to make space for the vital. Channel recaps that point to the one thread that matters protect your team’s attention and improve decisions.

# [**Otter.ai**](http://Otter.ai) vs Zoom AI Companion - meeting notes and action items

Meetings turn expensive when notes are sloppy and actions disappear. The right tool captures who said what, produces shareable summaries, and hands off tasks to the tools you use after the call.

**Live transcription accuracy, speaker labels, and multilingual support**

Accuracy lives in the boring details. Test in a real room with accents, cross-talk, and screen-share audio. The stronger system maintains punctuation, assigns speakers correctly, and keeps technical terms intact. If you host global calls, check language support and mixed-language handling.

**Summaries, action extraction, and CRM or doc handoffs**

A helpful assistant pulls decisions, owners, dates, and risks into a tidy recap. Then it pushes those items into your CRM, project board, or doc with links back to the exact timestamp. Verify the push, then verify the link. The tool that closes this loop without manual copy-paste wins.

**Plans, storage limits, and privacy settings for recordings**

If you record often, storage caps and retention windows matter. Review privacy controls: who can access transcripts, how deletion works, and whether your data is used to improve models. For teams, insist on SSO, audit logs, and policy enforcement on who can share or export recordings outside the org.

**Personal experience** I switched a client review cadence to recorded calls with instant summaries. The tool that let me jump from a summary bullet to the exact timestamp made post-call edits fast. It also reduced disagreements because we could replay the moment a decision was made and adjust wording together.

**Famous book insight** From *Getting Things Done* by David Allen, Chapter 6, p. 141: capture and clarify immediately or you will lose the thread. A meeting assistant that extracts actions and files them in the right system keeps projects moving without memory tax.

# FAQ

**How should I choose when both tools are strong** Use a repeatable scorecard tied to your work. Define your top three tasks, set quality bars for citations or code safety, and count how many edits you make before an artifact is publishable. The tool that reduces edits the most usually wins.

**What is the best way to test for privacy and compliance** Request a short security packet. Confirm training opt-out defaults, deletion pathways, region options, SSO, SCIM, and audit logs. Run a dummy export to verify you can retrieve data for compliance requests.

**How can I keep comparisons up to date without constant retesting** Set a quarterly review day. Re-run a trimmed version of your scorecard on one or two representative tasks, update your notes, and archive examples. This gives you a living comparison without burning a week.

**Where can I see my testing logs and prompt kits** I maintain a public notes index under my name for quick reference. You can browse benchmarks and prompt kits curated by[ Pratik Thorat](https://www.reddit.com/user/AI_Pratik/).

**Do I need multiple tools for research and packaging** Often yes. Many teams gather sources and citations in one tool, then format into slides or docs using another that fits their suite. The handoff adds minutes but reduces friction later.

**Can I get alerted when a tool’s policy or pricing changes** Create a small watchlist in your notes app. Track status pages and pricing pages. Ask your assistant to check once a week and append changes to a running log so you have a clear change history.

**What if my team wants to follow my updates and frameworks** I post updates on[ LinkedIn](https://www.reddit.com/user/AI_Pratik/) and in community threads where we trade test prompts, scorecards, and results. Following there makes it easier to reuse the same templates.

Has anyone else had any issues,"Hi, has anyone else had any issues with their BP and had to come off of elvanse before? About a week ago, I went from 30mg to 50mg, 30mg was fine for me, minimal side effects but was wearing off very quickly as I’ve got a high metabolism. On my 3rd day of 50mg, I went out for a coffee with my friend, I had 2x decafs and an hour later, I had palpitations, my BP shot to 155/90, I went to an urgent treatment centre to get an ECG which was all fine. I still wonder whether I’ve been given a normal coffee by accident as I’ve never had any issues like this before with the 30mg. On that same night I also did not sleep a wink! Which made me even wonder if I definitely had a non decaf coffee. On the 30mg, my BP has been normal around 120’s/70’s, before I started meds, it would sometimes go up to 130/90 and even 140. (I work as a nurse and I’m always on my feet) but when it started Elvanse, it stayed around 120’s.

I then went down to 40mg and have been checking my BP since then, which have been normal! Around 122/78 and 117/80. I sometimes get a bit of an increased heart rate when I’m doing something strenuous but it does settle when I stop.

I spoke to my pharmacist who offered to switch me to methylphenidate as it’s not an amphetamine based and apparently it should be a bit better for my BP. However I’m reluctant re-starting a different drug as I had such good results with elvanse, with the 40mg, I feel like the best version of myself! And it would be a shame to re start all over again. I’m not totally opposed to trying it but just wanted to see what other people’s thoughts are.

Has anyone else had any experience with their BP like this and if so, does it get better with time?? I am 27 female and 53kg, I don’t live unhealthily but I could be a bit better with my lifestyle. I’ve stop drinking whilst I’m on elvanse and no caffeine at all. I will exercising a bit more and have been conscious about my salt intake!

I know SJM technically has a shared universe but I’m not ready to jump back into that yet. I prefer thriller / horror books. Thanks in advance for the help. 

I have pasted the prompt below 👇 

28. A crossover (set in a shared universe) 
Prompts 28 and 29 are connected. Your book choice for 28 will influence prompt 29.

A shared universe is when two or more standalone stories take place in the same world setting with the same continuity. This means that one story has the potential to influence events in another story, or that characters from one standalone novel may bump into characters from another standalone novel. (Note: This is different than books in the same series, although books from separate series may share a universe.)
 
For this prompt, you may pick a book with a character crossover or character cameo (For example: the main character in book one enters a coffee shop and bumps into the main character from the author's previous novel). You might choose a location crossover (For example: the main character in one book visits or references a bar owned by a character in another book), or the book may reference events or information from another book. Books in a shared universe may or may not share characters.

I had my share of awkward dates, bad luck, or just times when the vibe wasn’t there. So here I am, giving it another shot - hoping luck’s on my side this time!

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female 
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No human kids 
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size.
- Pleasing to the eyes 

By day, I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). By night and during my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from a bookstore.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and going around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I also enjoy for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely. 💯 

Currently, I’m on a mission to shed some pounds—starting with daily brisk w@lks during sunset, which has been refreshing but feels like I’m being chased by regrets (or carbs 😂). I’m considering joining a gym soon, but I believe in taking it one step at a time. I hear having a cute fitness buddy boosts motivation... so, you in? 😉 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my fun side.

What I’m looking for… A guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:
- Age 27-35 years old
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a CENOMAR cert when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)

I know the SJM has a shared universe but I’m not quite ready to jump into another one of her books yet. I prefer thriller books.

Thanks in advance for the help. I’m excited for the recommendations 📚📚📚

Here is the prompt:

28. A crossover (set in a shared universe) 
Prompts 28 and 29 are connected. Your book choice for 28 will influence prompt 29.

A shared universe is when two or more standalone stories take place in the same world setting with the same continuity. This means that one story has the potential to influence events in another story, or that characters from one standalone novel may bump into characters from another standalone novel. (Note: This is different than books in the same series, although books from separate series may share a universe.)
 
For this prompt, you may pick a book with a character crossover or character cameo (For example: the main character in book one enters a coffee shop and bumps into the main character from the author's previous novel). You might choose a location crossover (For example: the main character in one book visits or references a bar owned by a character in another book), or the book may reference events or information from another book. Books in a shared universe may or may not share characters.

If anything the stay at hospital is just cemented the fact that I don’t wanna be here, I don’t want to be a person. I don’t want to be a parent.

I don’t have the capacity that other people have. It’s very hard to be. 
I have friends. I have family but it doesn’t make things better if anything it makes it harder, harder to want to not be here so bad.

So my comp coach I’ve had for 3 years has been a whirl wind of mixed messages and deeply hurtful things he has said to me and in front of clients
However when he has done something mean to me he goes and buys me something ( he is not lacking in money)
All his clients are his friends and he owns the gym so he can do and say whatever he wants to.
Recently I referred a friend of mine to my coach 
My friend lives around the corner and 
moved to this area recently
We are coffee klutch buddies 
Well everything was going great with him working out with my coach until he excessively talked and asked questions about me to my friend



My coach literally interrogated  my friend every time he works him out  asking about everything I’m doing who do I hang out with it goes on
Also saying I’m lazy , I’m not worth hanging out with etc.
My friend said he’s even on the phone while he’s supposed to be training him talking sh^about me every time he works him out
My relationship with my trainer is all kinds of messy 
Recently I started a new job (I’m in healthcare ) After 2 months I had to resign as I ended up having emergency surgery and not being able to go back for 6 weeks/but I can walk on the tread mill stroll like wall - not intense cardio what I’m used to.
well now my coach said he doesn’t want to talk or see me until I get a job
I can’t even go to his gym and use the treadmill because “I’m lazy and don’t have a job”
I clean his gym in exchange for training 
Money is not an issue here 
The last txd I got from him said “I don’t want to see or talk to you unless you have a job”
He brought me lunch one time so far and said “don’t think I’m going to get or do anything for you anymore until you have a job”
In the meantime my friend said he can’t take it anymore how my coach treats me so he’s going to tell my trainer he’s done 
I feel so bad that this coach has done so much damage not only to me but my friend who was doing really well losing weight getting in shape.
I offered to train him as we go to the same other gym.
My friend said his significant other is upset that he is quitting but whatever not my biz between them, but if his boyfriend asks me about it I’m staying silent
I feel terrible it turned out bad for my friend and worse my trainer is and has been so verbally mean to me (other clients see it but wont call him out because they are all tight with him )
My God I feel like such a loser but I did not plan having emergency surgery (gall bladder infected)I feel 1000% better! Other than this madness in my life with my comp coach
Do I stay at his gym after I start working again ? I already have 2 solid job leads
Idk if it’s my hormones wilding out or what but I know he’s awful to me face to face but I’m appalled by the things he said to my friend and the constant questions he asked him about me.
My trainer also has a habit of wanting to know where I’m at, and will quiz me to see if I’m telling him the truth as he and or has friends following me and if I’m home or not 
I’m trying to recover from a big surgery and I feel like my coach (fwb ish) was going to be there for me but he’s doing the opposite

1nrtemj,https://www.reddit.com/r/qatar/comments/1nrtemj/weekly_arabicenglish_language_exchange_in_doha/,Weekly Arabic–English Language Exchange in Doha?,"Hi everyone,

I’m exploring the idea of starting a weekly language exchange event in Doha where expats can practice their spoken Arabic (Khaleeji or standard), and Arabic speakers can practice their English (or other languages) in return.

The concept:
	•	Casual, social meet-ups in a café or community space.
	•	Conversation “rounds” so everyone gets a chance to talk.
	•	Weekly themes (ordering food, directions, cultural traditions, daily life, etc.).
	•	A mix of Arabic and English practice so both groups benefit.

What’s in it for Arabic speakers?
	•	Practice conversational English (or even Spanish/Turkish/etc. depending on who attends).
	•	Share local culture and traditions with people eager to learn.
	•	Build connections with the expat community in a fun, friendly setting.

I’d love to hear:
Would you join something like this?
Any tips if you’ve joined/organized a similar exchange before?
Best places to host it — coffee shop, outdoor space, community hall?

If there’s enough interest, I’d be happy to kick this off.",2,1758974369.0,qatar,1,1.0,False

1nrtc3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1nrtc3d/making_a_list_of_selfimprovement_goals/,Making a list of self-improvement goals.,"Hi, I wanted to share a list of what people focus on when it comes to *self-improvement* and *discipline*. They may do different things, but usually for the same purpose (well-being, performance, etc.).

I’m sharing this because I feel like most communities are *overspecialized* and tend to focus only on one aspect of life.

Let’s get started. I’ll try to order this list roughly the way Maslow might have, from what seems most essential to what might be less essential (but still important).

* **Food and drink**: less junk food, less sugar, fewer products shipped from the other side of the world, less of anything considered unhealthy or unethical.
* **Breathing and mindfulness**: for relaxation, focus, health, etc.
* **Temperature**: from Wim Hof–style cold exposure to simply not overheating everything, as many Westerners tend to do.
* **Sleep**: anything that really helps someone get truly refreshing rest.
* **Sexuality**: NoFap communities, avoiding pornography, etc.
* **Addictions**: of all kinds — from hard drugs to coffee, to non-chemical addictions like gaming, social media, and so on.
* **Letting go and kindness**: practices that help you feel comfortable in less-than-ideal situations, and that make you more of a giving rather than a taking person.
* **Anything personally meaningful**: for example, as a beekeeper, I used to work on my hives without gloves. It forced me to be truly careful about what I was doing, instead of rushing and messing things up just because I was protected.

It’s actually quite hard to make such a list, since some of these things overlap — especially the *breathing/mindfulness* part.

I’d really appreciate it if some of you could help me complete or refine this modest list, or simply add your own thoughts.

One last thought: since most communities are overspecialized, I wonder if the things they focus on sometimes come at the expense of something else nobody is paying attention to. Put simply, imagine someone addicted to cigarettes who quits smoking — but then doubles their coffee intake, or starts eating more junk food instead.",2,1758974138.0,selfimprovement,1,1.0,False

My lo was 8 weeks old when I first noticed dirty diaper with some blood dots in it. I called the doctors office, she assured me that its normal, digestive system is forming, bla bla and told me to ""monitor the situation"". I asked her about possible allergens and what to do, like maybe I need to eliminate dairy and she said ""maybe, its up to you"". So generally she just brushed us off... (I decided to cut diary, coffee, chocolate and citrus as those came as the most popular allergens in my google search).

Now one week later my baby lost 100 g. We weight him weekly just out of curiosity. He gained weight every week (except the first one, which is expected). To be fair, we use electronic home scale that are not specifically designed for babies. So maybe they can be wrong?..

He is EBF, otherwise seems happy - smiles when wake up, coos and blows raspberries, do not cry much, etc. We give him good bacterias drop (linex) as per our docs recommendation as well as vit D drops. We collect enough wet diapers daily (11-14).

But this weight loss got me really concerned. Next doctors appointment is on Friday, so another week to see if he gains any weight or not. Of course, blood in the diaper and possible weight loss MIGHT not be related, but it seems likely?...

What advice could you give us? What tests (if any) could be done? I have a feeling I should prepare and know what to ask for specifically (like names of the tests), otherwise our doctor will just tell to ""monitor the situation"".

1nrt6zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nrt6zy/what_are_the_newest_coffee_grinder_models_out_now/,What are the newest coffee grinder models out now?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts! I've been diving deep into the world of coffee grinders lately, and I thought I'd share what I've discovered about the latest models that have hit the market. As someone who's been brewing coffee for years, I can tell you that having the right grinder makes a massive difference in your daily cup.

I recently upgraded my old blade grinder, and the difference in taste is mind-blowing. After weeks of research and testing, I've found some incredible new models that I think you'll love. If you're interested in checking them out, I've found a great collection here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder

The newest grinders are focusing heavily on precision and consistency. I'm particularly impressed with the modern burr grinders that offer multiple grind settings - from super fine espresso to coarse French press. The technology has come so far that even entry-level models now provide features that were only available in premium grinders a few years ago.

What's really caught my attention is how manufacturers are incorporating smart features. Some new models have built-in scales, automatic dosing, and even Bluetooth connectivity. While these bells and whistles are cool, what matters most is grind consistency, and that's where these new models really shine.

I've noticed that noise levels are significantly lower in newer models too. Remember those ear-splitting morning grinds? Many current models use improved gear systems and better insulation to keep things quieter. Your family will thank you!

Durability is another area where I've seen major improvements. The latest burr sets are lasting longer, and many companies are using better materials for their hoppers and grounds bins. Some even come with anti-static features, which means less mess and easier cleaning.

For those interested in diving deeper into these new models, you can find detailed comparisons and reviews here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder

One thing I've learned is that investing in a quality grinder is crucial for better coffee. Whether you're into espresso, pour-over, or French press, having freshly ground beans makes a world of difference. The newer models are more versatile than ever, allowing you to experiment with different brewing methods.

Here's a pro tip: look for grinders with stepped adjustments if you're new to grinding. They make it easier to replicate your preferred grind size consistently. The more experienced users might prefer stepless adjustments for more precise control.

The price range for these new models varies widely, but I've found that even the mid-range options offer excellent value. They're built to last and can significantly improve your coffee game.

Remember, the grinder is often called the most important piece of coffee equipment - even more than the brewing method itself. These new models make it easier than ever to achieve cafe-quality coffee at home.

What's your experience with coffee grinders? Have you tried any of the newer models? I'd love to hear your thoughts and answer any questions you might have about specific features or models.",1,1758973676.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Ever stop and think about ""Future You""?

That person is real. They're going to inherit every single decision you make today. The good, the bad, and the ""meh, I'll do it tomorrow.""

Sometimes the idea of ""life optimization"" feels so massive, right? Like we need to overhaul our entire existence overnight. But that's a recipe for burnout. The real magic, the stuff that actually sticks, happens in the tiny, almost unnoticeable moments.

It's about making choices so small they feel insignificant, but when compounded over weeks and months? **Game-changing.**

Think of it like this: Future You isn't asking for a superhero. They're just hoping you'll do them a few small solids today.

Here are a few micro-hacks that have paid off HUGE for me:

*   **The ""One-Touch"" Rule:** When you pick something up (mail, a dish, a piece of clothing), deal with it completely. Don't just move it from the coffee table to the counter. Put it where it actually belongs. This single habit has destroyed 90% of my clutter.
*   **The ""Ready-for-Tomorrow"" Closeout:** Before you shut down for the day, spend 5 minutes prepping for the next morning. Lay out your gym clothes. Tidy your desk. Prep the coffee maker. Morning You will be so, so grateful.
*   **The Hydration Anchor:** First thing in the morning, before coffee, before anything else, drink a full glass of water. It's such a simple biological win that sets the tone for your energy levels all day.
*   **The ""Wait for It"" Win:** Next time you're waiting for the microwave or for a web page to load, resist the urge to pull out your phone. Just stand there. Breathe. Look out a window. Reclaim those tiny pockets of time for your own brain instead of feeding it more content.

It's amazing how these little things start to build momentum. You feel more in control, less reactive, and more capable.

Of course, sometimes the biggest roadblock isn't a lack of hacks, it's the emotional weight we're carrying. It's tough to optimize your life when your mind feels cluttered and heavy. For anyone struggling with that side of things, getting a clear plan to process those feelings can make all the difference. I found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** incredibly helpful for building that kind of emotional framework.

Ultimately, every tiny, positive choice is a high-five to your future self. 🙏

Rania ran for her life. She didn’t dare to slow down, even though her legs were in pain, screaming at her to stop. 

Her pursuer was so close. She couldn’t risk getting caught, it would be the end of her. 

\[Rania! Come back here!\] 

Her father’s voice boomed in her head, as he mind link her furiously. He was among the pursuer, including her stepbrother and the alpha’s son. 

Armed with a dozen warriors of Black Stone pack, Rania’s chance to escape the pack was close to none. Still, she had to try. The border of the pack was so close, she could feel it. 

Rania pumped her legs faster, begging the Moon Goddess to show her some miracle, as adrenaline rushed in her veins, numbing the pain from the belted branches and sharp edges of stones that cut her skin, as she ran through the forest. 

A little bit more. A little bit more. She told herself. 

Her backpack got caught in one of the branches, it halted her a bit, as the things inside spilled out, but Rania didn’t stop to collect them. instead she abandoned them entirely. 

She could find a way to get new clothes, once she got out of this pack. There was nothing important for her right now, but to get out of this hellish place. 

Unfortunately, Rania couldn’t shift yet. Most of the shifter would be able to shift once they turned eighteen and it was two days away for 

Rania. 

But, she was not going to spend another second here, especially after what the alpha’s son; Caden, did to her. 

\[Rania, you are dead, if got my hand on you!\] 

Her father, beta Alaric, snarled viciously in her mind. She tried to close the mind link, but she didn’t have the strength to do it. Her father was too powerful. 

So close. A little bit more. A little bit faster. 

Her lungs were burning, but Rania forced her way through, as she could see the border of the Black Stone. Beyond this was Bloody Wolf pack 

This part of the border was not heavily guarded, therefore Rania chose to use this path for her escape. 

A little bit more… 

And there, Rania managed to cross the border of Black Stone pack. It was marked by a river that ran between the two pack. The river was shallow, so she could cross it with ease. 

Once Rania was on the other side of the river, she collapsed on the ground, panted heavily, as her lungs tried to get the air greedily. 

Every inch of her body was in pain, but she did it! She managed to cross the border. 

On cue of an angry howl, Rania turned her body around and saw Caden and her stepbrother, Killian, shifted into the human form. 

They were glaring at Rama because they couldn’t cross the border without permission. It could escalate into a conflict between two packs 

Rania also couldn’t stay there for long, warrior from the Bloody Wolf pack would notice there was a trespasser, and she would get into more trouble She needed to go south, to the Solitary land, where no one owned the area and then moved further to the human habitation 

“Get back here, Rania!” Killian roared angrily, while Caden gnashed his teeth, and glared at Rania with killing intent in his eyes. 

Kama wanted to curse at them, but she didn’t have the strength for **that**. She needed to keep moving. 

Her body protested when she pushed herself from the ground, ready to run again when suddenly she was being tackled to the ground.

“Do you think you can run away from me, little wolf?” Caden asked menacingly. He used his body weight to render Rania unable to move. “You are not going anywhere.” 

“You… you crossed the border.” Rania breathed heavily. His knee pressed on her chest, which made her having a hard time to breath. It was very painful. 

“Yeah, so did you.” He smirked triumphantly. 

From across the river, Rania saw her father shouted at Caden to go back to the other side of the border before the warrior from Black Stone pack caught them. 

“Let’s go back. You are being very naughty tonigh 

in pain. Her scalp was burning. 

Caden said, he grabbed Rania’s long, brown hair, as he stood up, making her yelped 

Caden was so cruel, he didn’t even give Rania time to stand up, as he started to move toward the river. 

She was done for. They were going to kill her for her attempt to escape. 

However, before they could return to the side of their pack, a dozen warriors from Black Stone pack surrounded them and their gamma shifted into his human form. 

“Caden Black Stone,” gamma Michael said his name deliberately slow. “I don’t know that you have permission to **cross** our pack. He glanced at Rania, but paid no mind on her. 

“I am sorry, for the intrusion, but one of our pack members decided to be a little bit bold tonight. We caught her before she could bother your pack.” Caden smiled, he seemed unbothered, his grip on Rania’s hair tightened. 

Gamma Michael tilted his head at Rania, but he couldn’t see her face clearly, since her wavy hair covered half of her face. 

“I can understand that, but rule is rule. There will be consequences for this.” 

“I understood.” Caden nodded. “We can discuss this later, let me take this mutt back to my pack.” He gave a shake to Rania’s head, while smiling harmlessly at the gamma. “I will invite you for a coffee to discuss about this.” 

“No, please… no, don’t send me back,” Rania pleaded with the gamma, but he couldn’t care less about her. 

Gamma Michael contemplated his decision before he nodded. “Take her, and leave. I will discuss this matter with my alpha.” He looked at the other warrior from across the river.

I’m a psychiatrist from Melbourne, Australia, visiting family in NYC this October (10th-27th). 



While I’m wandering Central Park fighting jet lag, I thought it’d be fun to meet a Big Apple colleague for a coffee or something stronger if the hour allows. 



Nothing formal - just a chance to swap stories about the work, the city, and whatever else comes up. If anyone near the Upper West Side is interested, send me a DM and I can easily verify myself (LinkedIn, socials, etc.).



By way of intro: I’m 35, a new dad, and an early-career psychiatrist working in both public and private practice in Melbourne. My main interests are addiction psychiatry,  psychodynamic psychotherapy, and (of course) general psychiatry.

And there, Rania managed to cross the border of Black Stone pack. It was marked by a river that ran between the two pack. The river was shallow, so she could cross it with ease. 

Once Rania was on the other side of the river, she collapsed on the ground, panted heavily, as her lungs tried to get the air greedily. 

Every inch of her body was in pain, but she did it! She managed to cross the border. 

On cue of an angry howl, Rania turned her body around and saw Caden and her stepbrother, Killian, shifted into the human form. 

They were glaring at Rama because they couldn’t cross the border without permission. It could escalate into a conflict between two packs 

Rania also couldn’t stay there for long, warrior from the Bloody Wolf pack would notice there was a trespasser, and she would get into more trouble She needed to go south, to the Solitary land, where no one owned the area and then moved further to the human habitation 

“Get back here, Rania!” Killian roared angrily, while Caden gnashed his teeth, and glared at Rania with killing intent in his eyes. 

Kama wanted to curse at them, but she didn’t have the strength for **that**. She needed to keep moving. 

Her body protested when she pushed herself from the ground, ready to run again when suddenly she was being tackled to the ground.

“Do you think you can run away from me, little wolf?” Caden asked menacingly. He used his body weight to render Rania unable to move. “You are not going anywhere.” 

“You… you crossed the border.” Rania breathed heavily. His knee pressed on her chest, which made her having a hard time to breath. It was very painful. 

“Yeah, so did you.” He smirked triumphantly. 

From across the river, Rania saw her father shouted at Caden to go back to the other side of the border before the warrior from Black Stone pack caught them. 

“Let’s go back. You are being very naughty tonigh 

in pain. Her scalp was burning. 

Caden said, he grabbed Rania’s long, brown hair, as he stood up, making her yelped 

Caden was so cruel, he didn’t even give Rania time to stand up, as he started to move toward the river. 

She was done for. They were going to kill her for her attempt to escape. 

However, before they could return to the side of their pack, a dozen warriors from Black Stone pack surrounded them and their gamma shifted into his human form. 

“Caden Black Stone,” gamma Michael said his name deliberately slow. “I don’t know that you have permission to **cross** our pack. He glanced at Rania, but paid no mind on her. 

“I am sorry, for the intrusion, but one of our pack members decided to be a little bit bold tonight. We caught her before she could bother your pack.” Caden smiled, he seemed unbothered, his grip on Rania’s hair tightened. 

Gamma Michael tilted his head at Rania, but he couldn’t see her face clearly, since her wavy hair covered half of her face. 

“I can understand that, but rule is rule. There will be consequences for this.” 

“I understood.” Caden nodded. “We can discuss this later, let me take this mutt back to my pack.” He gave a shake to Rania’s head, while smiling harmlessly at the gamma. “I will invite you for a coffee to discuss about this.” 

“No, please… no, don’t send me back,” Rania pleaded with the gamma, but he couldn’t care less about her. 

Gamma Michael contemplated his decision before he nodded. “Take her, and leave. I will discuss this matter with my alpha.” He looked at the other warrior from across the river. 

“Thank you.”

1nrsxis,https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/1nrsxis/frustrating_pattern/,Frustrating pattern.,"I've been on a weightloss journey for around 5 years now. My weight has been up and down throughout the years but as of 2025, I have managed to lose around 81 pounds. 275lbs to 194lbs. This is the most weight I have ever lost and I know it should be celebrated but I can't help but feel frustration. 

Recently, I have noticed that when I reach 194-193, it seems like my cravings go into overdrive. Is this an actual thing? If so, what should I be eating or doing to fix it? Its super annoying as I have come so far and thought I was past the point of succumbing to cravings. I've been at it for 2 ½ months. I am supposed to be around 170 right now. I am scheduled to go on vacation in October and I am so disappointed in myself.

To give everyone a glimpse of my 1200 cal meal plan, I eat 2 eggs, 1 piece of bacon with wheat toast or low sugar yogurt in the morning w/coffee (light on the creamer, 1/2 teaspoon of sugar free almond milk) usually a protein bar or small salad (light on the dressing) for lunch w/water or sugar free juice and some type of meat, green veggies and around a cup of carb or starch for dinner. I have been eating this way since last November.

I should also add that I am moderately physically active and am constantly on my feet at work all day lifting, pulling, pushing, squatting and walking. Plus jogging outside of work.

It only seems like when I reach the mid 190s, my body goes into frenzy mode. Its a mess. I am so close to scheduling an appointment with my primary care provider for a possible appetite suppressant as a last resort. I am aware of the risks with those so this is why I am here asking for advice.

Feel free to suggest recipes also. I may just need to refresh my meal plan. ",0,1758972798.0,1200isplenty,1,0.5,False

I'm confused about this girl.

So I recently interned at a company over the summer, and we've all gone back to uni since school started.

 There's one girl in particular, let's call her X. 
I never really paid much attention to her at the beginning. 
1 day there was a company lunch event, and being interns, we didn’t really get to take much food. So she and another intern decided to walk to the nearby mall to get something light, while i was still sipping coffee and wondering whether i should follow. In the end I decided to follow, but she was already halfway to the mall. I walk fast, so I eventually caught up, and I swear I felt/tell her face light up and she waved Hi with a big smile.

Ever since then, we banter and tease each other often. E.g. when I doze off in the office (I'm half asleep, I still can hear stuff), I can hear her cheekily laughing while telling the other interns, 'Eh quick quick snap a pic and send to supervisor HAHA'. 

Or Whenever I get in trouble (small things e.g. forgetting to throw away a cup and get scolded), she'll laugh and point and wave her finger teasingly (with the orh horh), all which she doesn't do to others.

One time we happened to take the bus in the same direction together, and she talked and asked me alot of questions, how she comes to work, what's my family like, am I close to my parents and siblings, etc.

Near the end of the ride, I mentioned that I always check in with other friends of mine if i havent seen them in awhile, and I was also going to buy roses to give to the other 2 interns that were graduating soon. After that, she just said a very bleak ""Oh."". 

After that ride, the whole air in the office changed, we don't really talk to each other at all, and she got noticeably quieter. 

On her last day, as we were all waving bye, she made eye contact with me and held a lingering gaze for awhile, with quite sad eyes. 
After the internship, we dont really text anymore either.

Telling a certain chat site the situation, it tells me that I'm dumb.
I don't want to overthink this, i know other people will say ""oh that's just normal friendly"", Since she doesn't message after intership, obviously she doesnt care. etc. See if she was just being normal friendly, wouldn't she act like the 'friends vibe', like just normal small talk about the weekend or school starting soon or something.

I can't shake the gut feeling that I was a dense block. I really value all my friendships, and its quite saddening to me, that we can't even message and keep in contact, since we work in the same industry.

Hopefully I can get more ladies' perspectives on this, how would you act around someone you like if you're more shy and quiet/keep to themselves?",8,1758972573.0,SGExams,2,1.0,False

1nrsu8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nrsu8t/the_walk_home/,The Walk Home,"I used to think that walking home late at night was calming. The streets were quieter, the city’s noise folded down to a low hum, and the lamps made the sidewalks look softer. I learned the rhythm of my route by heart. There was a coffee shop with a neon sign that blinked every other minute, a corner where three different smells met and argued, and an alley with graffiti that never changed. Nothing exciting, but it felt safe.

That changed last Tuesday.

I had stayed later than I wanted at a group project. The train came and went without me because I was sorting a file, so I decided to walk. It was maybe twenty minutes, same route I had taken hundreds of times. My phone had one bar and an exhausted battery, but I told myself I did not need to call anyone. I put my earbuds in, turned the music down so I could still hear the world, and started walking.

A few minutes in, I noticed something odd. My steps were the only sound for a bit, then another set of steps joined in behind me. Not loud, not close, just there. I looked back thinking I would see someone walking a dog or a couple laughing, but the street was empty. The lamp posts cast long cones of yellow light and the spaces between them were familiar pockets of shadow. No one walked in those pockets.

I shrugged. Maybe a delivery guy had taken a different turn. I kept walking.

The steps matched my pace, steady and even. When I slowed, they slowed. When I quickened, they quickened. It felt like walking with a metronome I could not turn off. I turned my head more than once and the shape of the street behind me remained the same. There was no silhouette, no shadow, nothing that looked like a person.

Then I saw the coat.

It was hung over a garbage bin by the coffee shop window, a dark coat with a raised collar. It should have been empty, a piece of clothing someone left. But something about the way the fabric lay made it read like it had shoulders, the bend of a neck. For a second I convinced myself it was a jacket on a hanger, then the jacket slid. Not across the pavement, not in a wind. It shifted like someone settling into it.

I stopped.

The footsteps stopped with me.

I told myself this was ridiculous. I told myself I had stayed up too late, that my brain was making patterns where there were none. I checked my phone. Forty percent. Fine. I started walking again, slower this time, the music louder so it could fill the space where nerves wanted to live. The steps returned.

I took a different street, the kind that cuts between two blocks and saves you three minutes. The short cut had a row of hedges and a single working lamp. I always passed it at this hour because a cab would sometimes park nearby and the driver would sleep with the radio on. Tonight there was no cab, no radio, only the lamp and the hedges. The footsteps sounded behind me like someone walking on a sidewalk that existed only for them.

When I glanced over my shoulder, I saw a figure reflected in the lit window of a closed shop. The reflection was only the suggestion of someone, a smear of dark that matched me step for step. It did not have the structure of a real person. It was like seeing yourself in water that someone was pulling the surface of.

I do not know what made me do it. Maybe it was panic or curiosity or both. I stopped and turned around fully, standing with my back straight and my feet planted. The air felt thicker, like someone had closed the distance between me and the night. Nothing moved in the alley. Nobody stepped into the light. The coat on the garbage bin remained dirtied and empty.

Then the first step landed behind me, right against the lip of my shoe. Not a second after. Close enough that the vibration felt through the concrete. I did not feel threatened exactly. I felt watched in the old, animal way you get when something that should be separate becomes close.

I said, “Hey, can you stop? I’m going home.”

The voice that answered was not a voice I heard. It was the knowledge that the footsteps had stopped because I had spoken. And then from somewhere behind the hedges, something moved and a shadow folded across the lamp’s light, eating the space where the path should be.

I turned and ran. The sound of my own breath came down hard in my throat. I passed the coffee shop where the coat had been, and the coat was gone. The neon sign flickered like a blink. My phone, which had been calm a moment before, flashed low battery and then black. I fumbled with keys, swearing, hands shaking.

My front door was stubborn. My neighbor had a key and always left the lock a little sticky. I jammed my thumb in the key, turned, and the door opened with a sound that felt loud enough to be heard down the whole block. I slammed it, leaned my back against it, and slid down to sit on the floor. The city sounded normal. The bus on the main road whooshed in the distance. A couple laughed two houses over. I told myself I was safe now.

That night I slept in fits. Each time I woke I could not move for a second because I was waiting for the sound I had learned to expect: steps behind me, slow and patient. They never came. At dawn I went to work like nothing had happened because what else do you do when you are nineteen and your rent is due and you need to be useful?

Over the next three days I altered my routes, walked with other people, and avoided the coffee shop altogether. The steps followed none of those changes. They seemed tied to me like a shadow that had a mind. I would be in line at the grocery store and the sound of footsteps would drift through my head the way an old song does. It was never loud, never urgent, but always precise in its timing.

On the fourth night I forgot to take my umbrella and it started to rain. The city smelled different with rain on the asphalt, cleaner. I walked slowly because the slick pavement took trust. Near the corner where the alley cut through, a man in a bright jacket stood under the same lamp I had passed before. He was holding a paper cup and staring at his phone. When I walked by he did not look at me. He never did.

The steps began again. They kept time.

I walked to the crosswalk and waited for the signal. The man in the jacket walked up to the curb, matching his pace to mine, and then he stopped. He did not cross. He stood two meters away from me and stared at his phone until the walk signal blinked. When we crossed, he turned down a different street and disappeared into an open doorway. I did not see where he went beyond that.

Later, in the shower, I realized the skin at the back of my neck was raised where a collar press might have been. I cannot say if something touched me that night or if I had imagined the pressure because fear can copy feeling as well as any hand can. But since then the steps have changed. I can only hear them when I am standing still. They come when I am alone in a room and waiting for the kettle to boil, when my headphones are in and the world has become private. When I move, they stop. When I stop, they begin.

I tried to tell someone. Laughed off the first two attempts. The third time I explained to my friend exactly how it felt and he said, “Sleep deprivation, man. Get some rest.” I still hear them.

Last week I walked to the subway with my jacket buttoned to my chin and my head down. A woman on the platform asked me the time and I told her, and she smiled and said thank you and that was that. When the train came she boarded and I took my spot at the back of the car. The doors closed and the lights hummed. I looked at my reflection in the window and, for a single second, I saw another reflection behind me in the glass, exactly the same height and shape as mine, but darker, as if someone had stood just off camera.

I turned. The car was empty except for a sleeping man in a suit. When I looked back at the window the other reflection was gone. My breath fogged the glass and a drop of condensation slid across where that shadow’s face might have been.

I cannot say why it follows me or what it wants. I can only say the rules seem simple: it keeps distance, it keeps time, and it only appears when I am still. For now I am trying not to stand in quiet places too long. I keep the kettle on until it whistles, I walk to my bus stop at a brisk pace, I take calls on the sidewalk.

And every so often, when the city gets very quiet and I am pretending that nothing is different, I hear a set of steps that match mine. They do not come closer. They do not speak. They are patient and precise, like someone practicing how to be invisible.

If you ever walk home and you hear a pair of steps behind you that always match your speed, do not stop to look for a face. Keep walking. Keep your phone alive. Keep moving. It feels selfish to say it, but I would rather live with the feeling of being followed than find out what happens when I stand still.",3,1758972490.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1nrst6l,https://i.redd.it/tkl3f4qzzorf1.jpeg,A DETAILED report on how each male librarians blood would taste like,"
1. Roland: 

I think roland would actually taste very normal. Not to say he would be vanilla as vanilla is actually a very premium taste. Think of him like rice or milk as despite his [SPOILER] name he is White and Loud, grunting alot when you drink.

He would have the regular taste of copper/metal that you can get from blood. Although I do think that it would be slightly more viscous, and thick in the way were you have to use your tongue to push down on his wound to let draw blood from it like a weird faucet for fruit juice. 

He’s my little juice box and due to this the Shi association actually calls him ""The drink""

2. Yesod: 

Although kind of corny as he is the technology guy, his blood would taste alot more like metal especially the more rusted kind. 

He would additionally have more electrolytes in his blood stream than other people, I imagine after a long workout you would suck from his arm as a weird off-brand or, (from a freaks perspective) premium sort of energy drink, I guess it could even serve as a motivator for your daily workouts a sort of ""Prime"" candidate for such a task.

3. Netzach: 

Due to frequent drug and alcohol consumption he tastes alot like a sour gummy worm that was dropped under a couch and covered in 6-7 ants, because of this you should follow the protocol of screaming ""FIVE SECOND RULE"" and gobble that little dirty gummy worm up. 

You would also have to apply a ""five second rule"" when drinking him as more than 5 seconds of drinking would cause you to die from the lethal dosage (LD) of rat piss. 

You could even call him ""The Little Leptospirosis"" but you should also call the doctor.

4. Chesed: 

Kopi Luwak is a coffee made through the dung of the Asian Civet Cat. You can draw an analogy between this refined coffee and Chesed’s blood as despite coming from an ""Interesting"" source, it’s a delicacy and a very much 10/10, a true wine in the world of blood drinking.

If Netzach is the rat and Chesed is the cat. You can imagine that their relationship in blood drinking is like the famous duo of Tom & Jerry.

Jerry will keep on winning as nothing will take me away from my little week long hospital visit and I would go suck longer than a measly 5 seconds.

5. Hokma: He would taste like apples. I don’t know why but he would taste so much like apples that you would feel the spirit of Newton enter your mind.

As the patron Librarian of the floor of religion his blood would act as a sort of forbidden fruit, as it is the most refined and delicious in the library.

I would love to drink from him so ravenously that it starts to spill and stains his white clothing so hard he starts to cosplay geburah.

In some way by piercing your teeth into his blood stream you are ""Burrowing to Heaven"". After the good meal you leave his clothing with ""Bloody Wings"" that stretch and leave long ""Lean Pinions"", and when you put your ""Burrowing Gaze"" into his eyes, burrowing the gay into his mind you will find  ""Your Own Heaven""

I set my beer down and peeked out the window to make sure it wasn't my bookie trying to collect. It wasn't. What a relief.

Davis asked me who it was and I said I didn't know. Some woman with a hat on, clenching her purse like she was expecting it to be snatched by a thief at any moment. Not a good sign. If she was to be a new client... well that's a sign they don't like to part ways with cash unless they absolutely had to.

There was a light rain outside and I figured I better let her in anyway.

She popped inside with the kind of fake, polite smile middle aged women like her are practiced at presenting to strangers. Davis grew a few braincells and got her a towel to dry off while I took her coat and hung it on the rack by the closet.

I motioned her to sit on a sofa near the door. I sat opposite her on a cushioned chair. Davis handed me my beer which I sat on the coffee table between us. Then he stood by the fireplace, propping his elbow in the mantle.

She wiped her face with the towel and then spoke. ""I take it you're Mr. Highball?"" I nodded.

""And I take it you require my services and found my address in the phone book or were referred to me by a professional of some kind."" I replied.

""That's right,"" she said up. ""My name is Martha Billard. Father Lenord said you might be able to help me.""

""That all depends on what exactly you need help with and how much you're willing to pay for the help. That is, if I can help.""

""I can pay wherever you need. But the problem is somewhat... unusual.""

""I'm all ears.""

""Okay. Well, you see my husband was involved in a sort of scavenger hunt. An eccentric millionaire, Willard Scott Hayden hid a number of small chests throughout the city and chose a handful of people to try to find them.""

""Yeah, I read something about that in the papers. 'The Great Hayden Hunt' they called it. How did that turn out?""

""Oh, it was fine for a few of the hunters. One recovered a standard jewelry box full of expensive necklaces. Another one found an antique vase and sold it for a fair amount of money. My husband however, what he found... I don't know how to explain it. He found a small wooden box with.. inside it was a... human heart.""

That sobered me up. ""Did you say a human heart?"" She nodded.

I rubbed my brow with the side of my index finger. ""What did Mr. Hayden have to say about that?"" I probed.

""Nothing. You see he was quite old and by the time it was found he had passed away. The police coroner had it positively identified as human. They don't know whose it is.. er was.""

""Now that's a new one. Must have been quite a surprise. Him opening that box for the first time."" I almost smirked.

""Oh it was but you see, it affected him in an unusual way. He began getting paranoid. Pacing. Um.. looking out the windows all day and night. Like he was expecting someone. I'd started to think that.. somehow... he might have had some involvement in it other than just finding it.""

""Did you ask him about it? What did he say?""

""I tried to.. once. He just got angry and asked if I was accusing him of. You know. Of murder.""

""Well were you?"" I asked.

""No. Not really. But I have to admit the thought had crossed my mind. How could it not under such circumstances? I can understand  not getting a treasure like he expected. The disappointment after what was a very difficult and time consuming task. To then be the target of such a sick joke or whatever the old man thought it was.""

""That would be a let down for sure,"" I said.

""Yes, but his mood wasn't disappointment, or even anger. It was panic. I've been married to him for quite some time and I've seen him in a lot of different situations. I'm sure of it. It was panic.""

""Well you know him so well. Is he capable of killing someone? Or cutting their heart out?""

""No. At least I hadn't thought so. My God.. if I thought for a minute he'd do something like that I'd just...""

Davis popped open a cigarette case and offered her a smoke. She thanked him and took one out with her right hand while rubbing her cheek with her left. He lit it for her. As she took a puff I asked her more.

""Papers found out about it yet?"" She shook her head 'no'. ""What about the cops?"" I asked. ""What did they say?""

""They searched the old man's house and our house and dug through the records of the deceased here and throughout the country. Opened up cold cases and... they couldn't figure out who's body it came from. They interrogated poor Philip for hours. All night in fact. Told him not to leave town.""

""You know Mrs. Billard, police interrogations can be pretty unnerving even if you're innocent. It's perfectly normal for anyone to panic if they think the police might think they murdered someone.""

""Yes but he was panicking before we called them. Christ, he even went out and bought a gun."" She started to cry.

Davis brought her a box of tissues.

""So where is your husband now?"" I asked.

""I have no idea. That's what I needed you for.""

""Oh I see. I thought for a minute you wanted me to find the body and prove his innocence.""

""That would be nice of course but I don't expect miracles. He was just a crazy old man with a twisted sense of humor. I hope. At any rate I can't bear to think about Philip out there somewhere alone and half crazed. And what if someone was coming for him about this for some reason? What if it wasn't paranoia?""

She made a good point. Still I didn't fancy the idea of tracking down someone who was armed, in a state of panic, and who was also expecting someone to come after him. Whoever he was concerned about, he might mistake me for them and then I end up in the morgue looking like a piece of Swiss cheese.

I figured I'd try this one Sherlock Holmes style. Let's see if I can solve this without leaving the house, I thought. I offered her a glass of beer and she accepted. Davis brought us both fresh ones and we drank for a minute while I pondered my approach.

""Tell me about your husband. Is there anyone who might want to do him harm? Had he any connection to Mr. Hayden prior to the treasure hunt? Are you his first wife? Any old girlfriends who might have a problem with him?""

""Oh, heavens. Yes, I am his first wife and as far as I know, he didn't know Mr. Hayden at all. Never even heard of him. He did have a fairly serious falling out with a co-worker a few years ago and I think there was one girlfriend he dated before me who he'd complained about to me a few times.""

""We'll come back to those. First tell me how did he get mixed up in all of this in the first place? Why did Hayden choose him to take part in the hunt? If they didn't know each other?""

She looked up to the right thinking for a moment. ""I assume it had something to do with his work. He writes for the paper. Sports column. Mr. Hayden probably read his weekly stories about his  adventures fishing and camping. I suppose he thought he'd make a good candidate since the box was hidden in the wilderness just outside of town.""

""We're you with him when he found it?"" I asked.

""Oh no. I don't go outdoors much except maybe to the beach. He had a list of clues given to him by Mr. Hayden that he worked on in his spare time. he had all these maps and books and things laid out all over the basement. Every other weekend he'd go out somewhere searching for it.""

""Did you help him try to solve the clues?"" I asked.

""Not too much, but he'd tell me all about his solutions and where he thought the treasure was. It was fun listening to him."" She took a big swig of her beer.

""Where did you meet your husband Mrs. Billard?""

""Let's see,"" she put her finger on her chin and looked up again as before. I could almost see her mind flipping back through the years. All the memories. Hopes. Dreams. Good times together.

Then she remembered. ""I was working at a the A&W drive through as a waitress.""

""That were they come out on roller skates?"" I asked.

""That's right. I was always a good skater. I wanted to do it professionally only on ice. Or a dancer. But I was young and needed a job so I put those skills to good use anyway. Good thing I did because Philip came there all the time.""

That all made some sense. I needed more facts. ""What about this former co-worker of his? When did they have a falling out and what was the argument about?""

She sat up a bit at the question, surprised I didn't want to hear more about the old days at the diner. ""That was Jeremy Jones. He worked at the Daily Crier with Philip before he got his job at the Examiner. He pasted ad copy I think. They used to go have a drink or two after work now and then.""

""Oh yeah? Where'd they go if you know?"" I asked.

""Miller's I think. Went on for about a year and then one day he came home angry and said he was never going to hang out with him again.""

""Why's that?"" I probed.

""It seems Jeremy slapped a young woman he knew at the bar and made a whole scene. Philip said it scared the hell out of him and he didn't want to be around that kind of hoodlum.""

""Who was the girl?"" I asked with a slight grin.

Mrs. Billard shook her head. ""I don't know. Just someone he knew.""

""Alright Mrs. Billard,"" I said, ""tell me about this ex girlfriend of his who he complained about from time to time, as you put it.""

""Her name was Mary Ashley. All I know is that he said she was a slut and he's not dating no slut. That was about a year before we started dating he told me.""

""You tell all this to the police?"" I asked.

She nodded. ""I answered all their questions"".

I waved Davis over. ""I'll need $300 up front if that's alright?""

""Now?"" she asked.

""If you've got it on you that'd be best"".

She agreed and started going through her purse, still clenching it and keeping the contents out of sight like a dog clenching his bone. She pulled out a fold of cash and handed it to Davis who counted it and then looking at me nodded 'yes'.

I stood up and strolled leisurely over to the door. ""Alright Mrs. Billard,  I have solved the case,"" >!I said as I bolted the door with a lock I had specially installed so I could use a key from the inside.!<

>!She looked confused. !<

>!""Mrs. Billard,"" I said. ""The only thing I'd like to know is where'd you put the murder weapon? I assume it's in your purse.""!<

>!Her face turned red and mouth hung open.!<

>!""I did read about this treasure hunt in the papers. And as you said yourself, it was to take place in the city. Literally inside the city limits. Not in the wilderness outside the city. Your husband told you where he was looking so you went there and planted the box with the heart in it for him to find.""!<

>!She gulped, eyes widened. Davis scratched his face over what appeared to be a scowl. He always gets it last.!<

>!I continued: ""You took your cigarette with your right hand indicating you're right handed. This is important because not once, but twice you looked up and to the right when I asked you questions. That's a unconscious habit of right handed people when they are imagining something or making something up. Lefties look up and to the left when doing this."" !<

>!Davis' eyes widened and jaw dropped open in astonishment. ""Holmes."" I couldn't help but chuckle. ""I'll take that as a compliment Davis.""!<

>!""What were the questions you asked her those times?"" he asked.!<

>!""I asked her why Mr. Hayden picked her husband. She said he must have read his column. Funny. Why would someone lie about that? The other thing was where did they meet? The drive up diner she says.""!<

>!Davis looked befuddled. ""I don't follow you Jack.""!<

>!""If they didn't meet at the diner then where and why lie about it? Where might someone meet someone and not want anyone else to know they met there? And where might that same place also be a place where one might meet a millionaire? Or a ""slut"" which is what Mrs. Billard called Philip's ex? How about an adult gentlemen's club?""!<

>!Mrs. Billard put her face in her hands and a light came on, possibly for the first time, in Davis' dark brain.!<

>!""I have no doubt Mrs. Billard, that you did work at the diner at some point, but you said yourself you always wanted to be a dancer. I contend that you were a dancer. And at your job you not only met your husband, but you also met Mr. Hayden. And they met each other.""!<

>!Davis broke out the Scotch and poured himself one. Held the bottle up for me and I refused but Mrs. Billard waved him over. She needed one bad.    !<

>!""Mr. Hayden chose Philip due to him taking a liking to him over conversation. Or perhaps over taking a liking to you Mrs. Billard. In any case, why conceal that they knew each other? It's not a crime to meet at a stripshow.""!<

>!She had chugged her drink at this point and was waving Davis back for a refill. He obliged. !<

>!""The only reason to conceal that fact when facing a potential murder accusation is if the murder had something to do with the club. Perhaps your husband found comfort in another woman's arms and he met her there. The ex girlfriend you spoke of perhaps?""!<

>!""Son of a bitch!"" she yelled. ""Davis! That your name? Keep em coming!"" He scurried over with the bottle and played bartender.!<

>!""In a fit of jealous rage you hunted the girl down, killed her, and cut out her heart only to leave it as a treasure for your own husband to find. To gift him incriminating evidence. To put him in the hotseat as they say. Cold hearted revenge.""!<

>!Davis spoke up at that point. ""But why would that make him panic? If he didn't kill her?""!<

>!""Good question Davis. There's hope for you yet. It's because she disappeared around the same time he found the heart. his mind started going over the possibilities. Could it be her? What if they found her body and the heart had been cut out? They wouldn't waste any time coming for him. When some time had passed and he still couldn't get a hold of her, fear took over and he fled.""!<

>!""But why come to you then?"" asked Davis.!<

>!""Simple. To make herself look like she's concerned. She knew I couldn't find him. He could be anywhere by now. Same reason she went to the Priest who recommended her to me.""!<

>!Mrs. Billard had forgone the glass and was just chugging from the bottle now.!<

>!""One thing I don't get Jack,"" said Davis, ""did she kill the old man too and what about the time frame? The treasure hunt was already going on before she went missing? If so, then Philip would had to have known it wasn't left my Mr. Hayden.""!<

>!I smiled. ""That's two things but they're both good questions. No the old man died of natural causes. It was convenient timing for Mrs. Billard here. It'd look like her husband was using the hunt to try to pass blame on to Mr. Hayden. The treasure hunt hasn't been going on for more than a couple of months. Perhaps Philip did come to think Hayden had done it. Or perhaps he was growing suspicious of his wife, the only person who knew where he was searching.""!<

>!""Maybe she even led him to the spot while discussing the hunt, since he wouldn't be looking outside the city."" Davis smiled. He knew his IQ had just went up a couple points.!<

>!""Might be Davis. In any case, if the cops didn't charge him for it, she's got another suspect already wrapped up and made to order for them. The former drinking buddy who slapped some poor woman at the bar. Violent tendencies. Drinking all the time. Maybe he tried to frame Philip."" !<

>!""That's right,"" Davis added, ""she didn't know her name. Just some woman his buddy knew. She could be the victim.""!<

>!I nodded, ""For all anyone knows the heart belongs to her. Maybe she's the woman her husband was having an affair with. Maybe she's the ex girlfriend she told us about one and the same.""!<

>!""Alright!"" she shouted, now visibly drunk. ""You got it all figured out don't ya Mr. Jack Highball? Well you got no way to prove it. Get outta my way and unlock that door. You got no right to keep me in here.""!<

>!""Not so fast sister. You empty that purse of yours and if there's not a murder weapon in there you can go. But I'm still calling Lieutenant Kearns at the precinct anyway.""!<

>!""You ain't going through my purse,"" she slurred as she slumped back onto the sofa eyes half shut. Good thing she chugged down all that booze. !<

>!Davis took advantage of the moment and swiped the purse out of her drunken grasp. She made a half-assed effort to grab it as he pulled it away. He dumped the contents on the coffee table and sure enough, a Bowie knife fell out. And it still had some dried blood on it.!<

>!Mrs. Billard led the police to the rest of the body and gave a full confession.!<

>!After she was arrested and it came out in the papers, Philip surfaced. He'd been hiding out in a barn in Maryland. He said he'd guessed it was his wife and was hiding from her as much as he was from the cops.!<",1,1758972242.0,stories,0,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/5k0sfxqnxorf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=a49d19d05d69fbf149a719a849ccd77ebc96bd04

**Stellantis and General Motors alongside other companies are lending their support to a U.S. startup that is attempting to build a large-scale factories producing magnets. The tech companies are aligning to push back on China’s rare earth market dominance and its risks for industries reliant on magnets**

A U.S. startup backed by Stellantis, General Motors, and other global manufacturers is attempting to build a large-scale factory that does not rely on rare-earth elements. If successful, the venture could reduce U.S. dependence on China’s supply of critical minerals. 

# Fighting the rare earth dependence 

Niron Magnetics, the company leading the initiative, has developed a new magnet technology using iron nitride. The innovation is the result of decades of research by the company’s co-founder, Jian-Ping Wang, a professor at the University of Minnesota. 

Niron claims that the compound is cheaper, easier to source and also 18% more potent than conventional [rare-earth magnets](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-china-rare-earths-remains-unresolved/).

The company has begun work on a 1,500-tonne-per-year facility in Sartell, Minnesota, which it says will be capable of meeting around 3% of U.S. domestic magnet demand when operational in early 2027. Global demand for magnets is projected to surpass supply by some 55,000 tonnes by 2030. 

“Permanent magnets are in every device that powers the modern world,” Mark Champine, who heads Stellantis’ North America technical center, [said](https://www.ft.com/content/f0e37601-a15c-40d2-a241-aa835b686cf6). “Niron is meeting an urgent demand.”

# Beijing dominates the rare earths market 

Magnets are indispensable in modern technologies, embedded in everything from smartphones and wind turbines to electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. Until now, most high-performance magnets have relied on rare-earth elements such as neodymium, praseodymium, and terbium. These minerals are geologically scarce, difficult to refine, and largely controlled by China.

Beijing dominates every stage of the rare-earth supply chain, from mining to processing to magnet production. This market dominance has long been a source of concern for Washington and U.S. industries, especially as geopolitical tensions with China rise. The Japanese company Hitachi has a presence in the field, but Chinese producers overwhelmingly lead the market.

To counter this imbalance, [Cryptopolitan reported](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-government-rare-earth-china-comparison/) that the Trump administration invested heavily in the Mountain Pass mine in California through MP Materials, effectively making the U.S. government its largest shareholder. But building mines and processing facilities is slow, capital-intensive, and environmentally fraught.

But with Niron’s approach of avoiding using rare earths entirely, the company claims it can deliver a cheaper, cleaner, and geopolitically safer magnet. 

“Western rare earth companies are playing the Chinese at the same game,” said Jonathan Rowntree, Niron’s chief executive. “We don’t need to bring a mine online.”

John Ormerod, a rare earths consultant at JOC LLC, preached caution. 

“This is a holy grail kind of magnet, since iron and nitrogen are plentiful and low cost,” he said. “But we don’t have any data from Niron, which is frustrating and makes it impossible to make a hundred per cent accurate assessment.”

Despite the unanswered questions, Niron has attracted heavyweight backing. In addition to Stellantis and GM, its investors include Volvo Cars, Samsung’s venture arm, and other major industrial players. The company has raised about $150M in private funding and secured significant government support in the form of a $52.2M tax credit earlier this year, along with $17.5M in grants from the Department of Energy’s research arm in 2022.

Experts say financing is important for Niron as the company will eventually have to prove its technology in demanding fields such as electric vehicles, defense systems, and renewable energy.

“The magnet market covers everything from consumer electronics to military hardware,” Milo McBride, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, stated. “The smaller end consumer market will probably be first, but since the US has such a large magnet supply deficit, there’s no reason to not try.”

# SEPT. 27th, 2025~Trump Administration Moves to Break China’s Grip on Rare Earths

*New U.S. mining projects, executive orders, and defense-backed investments aim to counter Beijing’s market dominance.*

[Trump Administration Moves to Break China’s Grip on Rare Earths – \[your\]NEWS](https://yournews.com/2025/09/27/3976976/trump-administration-moves-to-break-chinas-grip-on-rare-earths/)

https://preview.redd.it/6w2iyl7qxorf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=52afc5fdf009069ed264efefb7c935d7418aa653

President Donald Trump’s administration is accelerating efforts to reduce America’s reliance on China for rare earth elements and other critical minerals, a dependency that U.S. officials and industry leaders call an existential threat. The push combines domestic mining incentives, expedited permitting, deep-sea exploration, and defense-backed market guarantees designed to outmaneuver Chinese state-subsidized control of global supply chains, according to an in depth [report by The Epoch Times](https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/how-trump-admin-is-breaking-the-ccps-hold-on-rare-earths-5908257?ea_src=frontpage&ea_med=section-1).

On July 11, 2025, Ramaco Resources is slated to begin extracting more than 450 tons of rare earths from its 4,500-acre Brook Mine in Wyoming. This marks one of several new U.S. projects launched after Trump’s return to office, framed as the next phase of a decades-long struggle to revive American mining and refining. The [National Materials and Minerals Policy Act of 1980](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-10930/pdf/COMPS-10930.pdf) originally set the priority, but U.S. manufacturers have grown increasingly dependent on imports, particularly from China, as documented by the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/mineral-commodity-summaries-2025).

**China’s dominance became apparent in the 2010 “rare earths crisis” and has deepened through successive export restrictions, most recently in April when Beijing added seven minerals—including dysprosium, terbium, and yttrium—to its embargo list. Today, the United States is fully import-reliant on 30 minerals where China controls at least 75 percent of global refining, according to** [**Exiger**](https://www.exiger.com/perspectives/critical-minerals-weaponization-periodic-table/)**, a supply chain risk firm working with the Pentagon.**

“The reality is, this is no longer a hypothetical risk. It’s a real, quantifiable supply chain chokepoint right now,” said Derek Lemke, Exiger’s senior vice president. “We’re seeing the weaponization of the periodic table.”

Trump has responded with a series of executive actions. His 2017 [critical minerals order](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/26/2017-27899/a-federal-strategy-to-ensure-secure-and-reliable-supplies-of-critical-minerals) directed agencies to define and secure resources essential to national defense. A 2020 [follow-up order](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/10/05/2020-22064/addressing-the-threat-to-the-domestic-supply-chain-from-reliance-on-critical-minerals-from-foreign) declared a national emergency over U.S. dependence on foreign adversaries, particularly China. After his 2024 reelection, Trump issued the “Unleashing American Energy” directive, followed by a March [order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/) that opened more federal lands and invoked the Defense Production Act. In April, he signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/unleashing-americas-offshore-critical-minerals-and-resources/) to initiate deep-sea mining on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.

These steps align with funding streams set in motion by earlier laws, including the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the 2022 CHIPS & Science Act. The Department of Energy has since announced [major awards](https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-actions-secure-american-critical-minerals-and-materials-supply), including $50 million for new processing technologies, $250 million for byproduct recovery, and $500 million for mineral projects, plus $36 million to extract critical minerals from industrial wastewater.

Industry and government are now working in tandem through initiatives like the [Critical Minerals Forum](https://cmforum.org/), founded in 2024 with DARPA backing. Apple, MP Materials, and more than 30 other companies have joined to develop U.S.-allied refining capacity. In Texas, MP Materials, with $400 million from the Department of Defense, has [opened](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Announces-Transformational-Public-Private-Partnership-with-the-Department-of-Defense-to-Accelerate-U-S--Rare-Earth-Magnet-Independence/default.aspx) a second processing plant to bolster rare earth magnet independence.

Still, experts caution that challenges remain. “The U.S. isn’t short of resources; it’s short of refining, recycling, and permitting speed. That’s where the race will be won or lost,” said Avadh Nagaralawala, an Arizona-based mining automation consultant.

Steve Christensen of the Responsible Battery Coalition said Trump has given the issue unprecedented focus. “The president understands this issue, I think, probably better than any president in recent history,” he said.

Lemke, while noting China’s advantage, said the momentum is shifting. “The quickest way to spin up this industry is to get the large players together, quantify their need, and make the direct investments. … It’s an existential challenge few Americans understand,” he said.

For Trump’s administration, the objective is clear: rebuild the domestic mineral base, diversify global partnerships, and ensure that American industries are no longer vulnerable to CCP market control.

The additional obligation will be applied to the scale-up of titanium production and advanced manufacturing capacity at IperionX ‘s Titanium Manufacturing Campus, enabling output of up to 1,400 metric tons per year (tpa).

The IBAS program is designed to reinforce U.S. defense supply chains by fostering a resilient, low-cost, mineral-to-metal titanium platform that reduces reliance on imports and establishes a secure uninterruptible domestic source of critical materials.

This latest obligation follows prior tranches of US$12.5 million and US$5 million, which funded long-lead items for titanium manufacturing equipment and to advance the Titan Critical Minerals Project in Tennessee to shovel-ready status. Total obligations now stand at US$42.5 million, with the remaining US$4.6 million expected to be obligated by the DoW over the contract term.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

# RECAP of ""The real signals & Bombshell"" that came out of Mark’s Wainwright talk:

[MUST WATCH EVENT @@!! IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE SO..](https://preview.redd.it/7tkppcfayorf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=32dc707ae4e6b6fddc4974e6729fefca2d36a372)

# 🛑 1. Titanium

* **Confirmed:** talks with *three* U.S. majors. That’s the supply chain gap (aerospace, defense coatings, alloys).
* **Read-through:** Niocorp is positioning itself as a domestic TiCl₄/TiO₂ anchor, and that’s squarely in the **DoD/DOE wheelhouse**. A major U.S. titanium producer (think **TIMET/ATI** or even **Chemours** for TiCl₄) could lock in here.

# 🛑 2. Rare Earths / Stellantis

* **Stellantis drama** → slowed by management reshuffles, but “back on track.”
* **Read-through:** Stellantis is *still live*. They want *all* REEs. If the DFS proves scale and recovery, Stellantis could come in with a **multi-metal anchor offtake.**

# 🛑 3. Scandium Metal Demonstration

* DoD involved → using two different methods to produce scandium metal.
* NanoScale-like tech strongly suggests collaboration with Ames Lab / Nanoscale Powders type pathways.
* First Metal Nov 2025. That’s basically a demo milestone that could trigger direct DoD procurement & validation.
* 🚨 Game-changer alert for Niocorp 🚨 \~BELOW\~

# 🛑 4. ScAl Alloy + Gen VI Fighters (**🔥 HUGE)

* Direct quote: Working with a DoD prime contractor on Sc-Al alloy integration.
* Gen VI fighter → 360° view, doubled threat detection, range boost.
* This is an operational security tell — ScAl alloys are already in classified development pathways for NGAD (Next Gen Air Dominance).

# ****Mark teased a partnership soon. That’s your strategic bombshell!!!!

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

**FOLLOWING UP ON A $50 MILLION DOLLAR RAISE**

# ON SEPT. 26th, 2025 NioCorp Announces Pricing of $60.0 Million Public Offering of Common Shares (That Closes @ Monday, Sept. 29th, 2025)

[NioCorp Announces Pricing of $60.0 Million Public Offering of Common Shares | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-announces-pricing-of-60-0-million-public-offering-of-common-shares/)

https://preview.redd.it/r3uln72eyorf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=78cb822ed5c5abb01174d8d82164afe0bdbce341

ENTENNIAL, Colo. (September 26, 2025) – NioCorp Developments Ltd. (“**NioCorp**” or the “**Company**”) (**NASDAQ:NB**) today announced the pricing of its previously announced public offering in the United States (the “**Offering**”). **The Offering is expected to consist of up to 9,760,000 common shares (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) at a public offering price of $6.15 per common share (or $6.1499 per pre-funded warrant), for gross proceeds that are expected to be approximately $60.0 million before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses.**

Maxim Group LLC is acting as sole placement agent for the Offering.

NioCorp currently intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including to advance its efforts to launch construction of the Elk Creek Project and move it to commercial operation. The Offering is expected to close on or about September 29, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

The Offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-280176), previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June 13, 2024 and subsequently declared effective by the SEC on June 27, 2024. NioCorp may offer and sell securities in both the United States and other jurisdictions outside of Canada. No securities will be offered or sold to Canadian purchasers under the Offering.

# WITH RECENT $50M & $60M RAISES IN HAND NIOCORP'S PATH FORWARD CATALYSTS ARE STACKED!

[The Q-4 Path Forward is STACKED!](https://preview.redd.it/wfwhpawfyorf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d6094ebb90045e9a485e29696d8553ee2146edd)

# NioCorp Ignition Sequence: Catalysts

* **Scandium Price Floor Set:** Pentagon’s $40M scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto (\~$6,250/kg) validates scandium’s defense role. Elk Creek is the only U.S. project positioned to deliver at scale.
* **Capital Stockpiled:** $50M raise completed, plus $60M offering closing Sept. 29th — funding momentum into Q4.
* **Government Tailwinds:** Pentagon stockpiling, EXIM/DFC windows, and potential U.S. equity stakes in strategic mineral firms.
* **Stacked Catalysts Ahead:** Munich conference, October drill results, scandium-alloy announcements, offtakes, updated DFS, and EXIM FID.
* **Strategic Convergence:** Niobium, scandium, titanium, and REEs — Elk Creek represents U.S. resource independence at scale.

**IMHO- The chessboard for critical minerals just shifted.** Reuters confirmed the Defense Logistics Agency’s $40M scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto at a \~$6,250/kg floor **— a de facto price signal that scandium is now locked into defense supply chains.** Yet Rio’s volumes are limited, leaving NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project as the only U.S. source positioned to deliver scandium at scale. **Mark Smith’s hints at scandium-aluminum alloy partnerships with defense primes only heighten the relevance, as the Pentagon pivots to future alloys for next-generation jets and systems.**

**Against that backdrop, NioCorp has raised $50M and followed immediately with a fresh $60M offering closing Monday, September 29th.** These aren’t signs of weakness but ammunition — capital stockpiled right as macro forces align: Pentagon stockpiling, EXIM/DFC funding windows, and even reports of direct U.S. equity stakes in strategic mineral firms. Thacker Pass lithium is already under review; niobium, scandium, and titanium are just as indispensable. Federal ownership would be the ultimate de-risking signal, a catalyst that could accelerate both financing and market credibility.

**That leaves Q4 loaded:** Munich conference visibility, October drill results with potential to re-rate the entire deposit, scandium and alloy announcements, off-take agreements across multiple products, and the updated DFS. Add in an EXIM/DFC final investment decision, Great Britain collaboration, and a 2029 production horizon, and Elk Creek stands at the intersection of government strategy and market demand. **This isn’t just a mine — it’s a U.S. resource independence play, with catalysts stacked and ignition sequence armed.**

# NioCorp —is shaping into ~""The Flagship U.S. critical minerals hub!""~

# With drilling results due mid-October, Scandium alloy news in November, and a Q4 DFS into EXIM/DFC financing, the ignition sequence is stacked. 🚀

My name’s Max de Jonge, I’m 17 and in my final year of 5 HAVO at Visser ’t Hooft in Leiden. In my free time I love working on small engineering projects — I’ve built hydrogen generators, tinkered with drones, written simple algorithms, and made my own circuits.

I reached out to ASML and they told me it would be fine if I can find someone willing to take me in for a short internship or job-shadowing experience. My main interest is Electrical Engineering, and I’d be really excited to learn more by spending a couple of days with engineers at ASML.

The dates I’m hoping for are October 13–15, 2025. If anyone here knows someone who’d be open to having me shadow them, or has advice on how to arrange this, I’d be super grateful. I’m happy to prepare any skills that might be useful — and if not, I make a mean cup of coffee!

Thanks a lot :)

Good afternoon,
I'm not sure if you are the correct person to contact, but Ethan gave me contact information earlier. This is regarding the area around Republic Bank at 333 West Vine St. The tree wells haven't been cleaned in some time now and I don't know if anyone checks on them. I've included pictures to show you the condition of this area.

Scrubbed floors and toilets nightly for MINIMUM WAGE. And my pay went up like 15 cents in the 4 and a half years I've been there. I've literally worked at McDonald's and I didn't even have to do all of that, and the pay was the same. And no, the benefits don't make up for it, it's literally the bare minimum (like 1-2 physiotherapy sessions covered for the entire year, oh please), and we all have to work consistently minimum 25 hours a week to receive those benefits (everyone got scheduled 21 hours!! wow!)

Half of my SMs (some ended up getting fired) had absolutely zero social and situational awareness and would threaten to document and fire all of us all the time because we didn't ask the person in front of us how their day is, what they do for work, that their scarf is pretty... Literally standing there, shouting to us ""I don't hear you connecting!!!"", wtf?... We keep getting told by upper management and corporate that these customer connections bring back customers and increase sales and-STFU, NO IT DOESN'T, NO ONE CARES, EVERYONE JUST WANTS THE PRODUCT AND THEIR COFFEE FOR THE DAY REGARDLESS IF WE DO... and I'm sure you guys writing on the cups, no one cares about that either! Customer connections are NOT a thing. Just be human and talk to people naturally, don't let the company make you tell yourself ""I love to connect with my customers!"", no, stop.

I've made small, stupid, casual comments like ""I'm tired, I don't wanna work anymore, I just wanna stay at home and be lazy!"", and my SM sat me down for a 1 on 1 on their office and asked me ""Are you not happy here? Do you not like your job? Do you not like Starbucks?"". We're expected to drink the kool-aid and be bowing down and worshipping the siren.

This post is not towards any other baristas, shift supervisors, and even (some) store managers I've worked with/phantomed for; because we were all in the same boat, we all recognized all of this, we all knew this was BS, we all felt overworked, we were unhappy.

And now, I'm waking up to the news today and now a bunch of stores are closing and people, including those who really put their years into the company, are losing jobs. I was right, the company never cared. All those training videos of ""Starbucks is a great company! We love Starbucks!"" all BS. As I am no longer a partner and it's been years, I hope you all get out ASAP and find something better. Work for a company that cares about you and values you, not a company that forces you to love Starbucks and make Starbucks your whole life, but will dispose you when it's convenient for them, like they are doing now. My friend, who loved Starbucks as a company and worked for them for almost 8 years, was also just fired.

1nrshfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1nrshfz/suddenly_waking_up_early/,Suddenly waking up EARLY.,"Hello. I’m 25M and used to rarely have trouble sleeping. I would go to bed at 10 PM or 10:30 PM and wake up at 6 AM, usually without much issue. I still don’t have much issue falling asleep.

However, for about the last two weeks I’ve been waking up ridiculously early. I’m talking like 3:30 AM. Sometimes I am able to return to sleep, whereas other times I am not. Today I figured it wasn’t worth trying to sleep any more, which I regret doing, because now my eyes feel heavy at 7 AM. I probably could have gotten another 2-3 hours if I’d tried hard enough.

As to the source of waking up early, I think the initial reason was that I had an awkward secret that I’d decided to tell my parents and get off my chest. I’m not eager to post about what specifically that secret is. But now that I’ve told them, I feel a lot less nervous. And yet I’m still waking up very early, which is why I think my circadian rhythm adjusted to this bad habit. I think that’s the problem. 

I have a doctor’s appointment next week, and I’d rather not have to tell my doctor about this secret, as it’s heavily awkward. I will tell her about my sleep troubles in roughly these terms. I know that whatever I tell her about medical stuff is confidential, but it’ll still be highly embarrassing to admit with my own vocal cords. I hope I don’t need to admit it. But I might have to if I think that’s what is costing me sleep. As a grad student, I really need sleep.

Anything else that might be relevant…I’m autistic. I’m about 6’3” and about 200 pounds, so while I’m not obese by any means, this problem likely isn’t related to low blood sugar. I do not drink coffee or alcohol, and I do not take any drugs except those that are prescribed to me and have been for years. 

Until two weeks ago, I’ve had little trouble staying asleep through pretty much the whole night. I used to look at my phone while flossing and brushing my teeth - I think I’ll stop that, and maybe charge my phone in another room when I can. That way I’ll be less tempted to check the time.

If anyone can give me advice, that would be wonderful. I want to get back to a regular cycle, because getting 5 hours instead of 7-8 can really make a difference after two weeks.",1,1758971254.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

The same day Lizzie Bradford found out she had a brain tumor, Ophelia Bullock was injured on set. Without hesitation, Adrienne Lennox rushed to her side.

Entertainment news exploded with headlines about Adrienne and Ophelia rekindling their romance, painting Lizzie—Adrienne’s “official wife”—as the unwelcome intruder in her own marriage.

Lizzie and Adrienne had been childhood sweethearts, the couple everyone in town talked about. For years, people had believed they were a match made in heaven. Five years of marriage, a love story that seemed destined by the stars… or at least, that’s what Lizzie had always thought.

But now, as the pieces of her life shifted, Lizzie began to understand something she hadn’t before: sometimes, the heart wants what it wants and there’s nothing she can do to change it.

So, she let him go.

\*\*\*

Twenty-four hours had passed since Ophelia’s accident. The best window for Adrienne’s PR team to act had already closed. Yet the trending news about “Adrienne and Ophelia” stayed at the top, drowning out everything else, burying Lizzie along with it.

If the headlines hadn’t died down by now, it was because Adrienne didn’t want them to.

Sitting in the empty living room, Lizzie clutched the doctor’s diagnosis, his words echoing in her mind.

“Mrs. Lennox, the tumor’s pretty large. Surgery will be tricky, but waiting for it to grow could make it riskier—it might affect your memory, coordination, or even put your life at risk. I suggest calling your husband right now so we can perform the surgery immediately.”

Lizzie called Adrienne, giving no details, only asking him to come to the hospital. He had agreed at first, telling her to wait for him.

But over an hour later, he still hadn’t shown. She called again, only to find his phone off. Finally, his assistant informed her he was on a flight to Eastport.

When she asked why he went to Eastport, the assistant simply replied, “I’m afraid it’s on the news, Ma’am. Trending all over social media.”

Sure enough, as soon as she opened her social media account, the trending number one read: An accident on set, actress Ophelia Bullock hospitalized for severe burns.

Looking at the headlines, Lizzie hugged her coat tighter around her shoulders. She realized then that winter in Westport felt colder than usual. She dialed her brother Darius, but halfway through the call, she remembered the time difference—it was still early morning where he was. She hung up.

Once home, she called Adrienne another seven or eight times, but he never picked up. Usually, she didn’t bug people if they were busy, but tonight was different. Tonight, she actually wanted to annoy him, to make him pick up and snap at her, just to acknowledge she was there. But he didn’t.

Sinking further into the couch, she felt a heavy sense of helplessness. The Bradfords and Lennoxes had a long history together and she and Adrienne had been inseparable as kids. No one was surprised when they ended up married. But Adrienne had always kept his distance. She’d figured it was just part of being so comfortable with someone, that maybe they were just an “old married couple” where affection and intimacy are part of daily life.

But today, seeing how Adrienne had dropped everything to be with Ophelia, how he ignored everything—the news, the crashing stock prices—she finally realized this so-called “familiarity” had been nothing but an illusion.

Both her in-laws had called. At first, she didn’t want to answer, but her mother-in-law, Yolanda Lennox, texted, insisting she was coming over to check on her. Reluctantly, Lizzie picked up the call. Yolanda’s gentle voice came through, “Lizzie, have you been able to reach Adrienne?”

“No, I haven’t,” Lizzie replied.

Yolanda paused. “Don’t worry about it, okay, sweetheart? You’re still the one and only woman of Adrianne. Only you are our legitimate daughter in-law. I’ll speak to Adrienne, ‘ll tell him to return immediately and make sure he apologizes to you, okay”

Lizzie forced a weak smile. She wanted to say she didn’t need an apology. This was between her and Adrienne. Her in-laws had always treated her kindly, so there was no need to vent her frustration on them. “Thanks, Mom, but you don’t need to worry. I’ll be okay. I just… I’m not sure I can face the reporters right now.”

“No, no, no, you don’t have to. We’ll take care of them. You just rest for the night, alright?” Yolanda assured her.

Not long after Yolanda hung up, Adrienne’s call came through. Lizzie answered, putting him on speaker. Shortly after Yolanda’s call ended, Adrienne finally called. Lizzie answered, putting him on speakerphone. His voice was cold, as if she were some stranger intruding on his life. “It’s late. What’s with all the calls?”

“Nothing important.”

A brief silence followed before a voice came through the phone, “Mr. Lennox, Miss Bullock is awake and asking for you.”

“In a minute,” he replied, hanging up without another word.

The dial tone echoed in Lizzie’s ears. Adrienne and Ophelia had dated off and on throughout college. Lizzie had liked Adrienne since she was a teenager and he knew it. Watching him with Ophelia had been painful, but she’d kept her feelings hidden.

Then, at a friend’s wedding, Adrienne caught the bride’s bouquet and turned straight to her with a proposal. Not wanting to embarrass him, Lizzie said yes.

That night, she tried explaining her feelings, but Adrienne just started pursuing her. It seemed like a dream—just like everyone expected, they got married.

She walked down the aisle full of hope, only to be met with a husband who remained emotionally distant. Life with him had become monotonous. But now, thinking back, she realized Adrienne had never truly let go of Ophelia.

So, what was she to him? A convenient stand-in? A painful ache settled in her chest as her vision blurred. She curled up on the couch, trembling. Finally, she took a steadying breath and picked up the phone, calling her brother. “Darius, I’m coming back to London in a few days.”

“Will Adrienne be with you?”

“No, just me.”

He hesitated, concern lacing his voice, “Did you two have a fight?”

Lizzie stood by the window, letting the cold air sting her face. Her throat tightened. “No… remember I’d talked about going back to grad school? It’s about time I actually did it. Adrienne’s busy; maybe he’ll come around the holidays.”

Relieved, Darius let out a breath. “Alright. Just let me know when and I’ll pick you up from the airport.”



After a few more exchanges, the siblings ended their call. Lizzie carefully folded the medical report on the coffee table and tucked it away, choosing to retreat into the silence around her.

Adrienne returned a week later, but not alone—he brought Ophelia back from Eastport and settled her in the house next door. That property had originally been a wedding gift from Darius to Lizzie. Even though it had been hers for years, she’d never lived there, only sending a housekeeper occasionally to clean it. But now, Ophelia was moving in.

In her relationship with Adrienne, Lizzie had always been submissive, so much so that she’d rarely voiced her needs. Even when conflicts arose, she would swallow her pride, choosing peace over arguments. This time, though, she wanted to ask Adrienne if he thought it was really appropriate.

But as the words reached her lips, she swallowed them back. She’d already decided to leave; why bother now?

After a moment, she looked away from him and went back to packing up her books from the bookshelf.

Adrienne noticed her distant, empty gaze and, feeling a need to explain, said, “It’s only temporary. It’s more convenient for her medical team to have her nearby.”

Facing away from him, Lizzie smirked but chose not to argue. “She can stay, but you’ll need to let Miss Bullock know. Real estate agents might be coming by soon to show the place to potential buyers, so it may get a bit disruptive.”

Adrienne’s brow furrowed. “Why do you want to sell it? Are you short on money?”

Lizzie slipped another book into the box and looked up at Adrienne. “Not at all. It was a wedding gift from my brother and it’s just sitting there gathering dust. I thought it might be better to sell it.”

Adrienne watched her, puzzled. With the Bradford and Lennox Family fortunes, there were plenty of things that sat unused. But he knew she was making up an excuse. He wanted to press her further, but Lizzie was focused on her task, clearly not interested in talking.

As he prepared to leave, Adrienne noticed her packing up the books in boxes. Initially, he’d thought she was just tidying up. “Why are you packing up these books?”

“Just organizing a bit. Thought I’d put these out in the sun for a while.”

Adrienne nodded and paused as he remembered Lizzie’s recent call. “By the way, how’s with your medical check-up? Is everything’s fine? It was all so rushed that day; I didn’t get a chance to call you back.” Lizzie paused, reminded of the tumor in her head that could burst at any moment. She gave a slight shake of her head, downplaying it.

“Nothing serious.”

Adrienne responded with a slight hum. “Well, Ophelia’s injuries are quite severe and her mood’s been all over the place. I’ll be staying over there more often.”

“Sure, take care of her,” Lizzie replied with calm indifference, showing no sign of any reaction. Adrienne didn’t press further and left for the other house.

Watching him go, Lizzie stood by the window, a small, bitter smile forming as her eyes grew misty. This house—the living room couch, the bed in the bedroom, the entryway painting, the curtains on the windows, even the spare slippers—she’d chosen each item, carefully decorating every corner with hopes for their future together. But now, every detail seemed like a cruel joke.

After finishing with the books, she picked up her phone to call Mara for dinner. But just as she was about to dial, a call from her came in.

“Lizzie, check the news.”

Lizzie opened it to find a trending post about Adrienne and Ophelia rekindling their relationship.



She clicked into the post to find a message from Ophelia: “No matter how far I wander, my heart always returns to you.” The image showed Adrienne’s silhouette, standing over a simmering pot of soup.

The comments were a mix of delighted fans celebrating their favorite couple’s reunion and people slamming Lizzie, claiming she’d driven Ophelia away so she could marry Adrienne. Some even suggested that her abandonment was karmic justice. To them, she was the one who had separated their beloved Ophelia from Adrienne and now that he had seemingly left her, it was no more than what she deserved.

As Lizzie scrolled through in silence, Mara’s voice came through on the line. “You want to tell me what’s going on? Did you and Adrienne split up?”

After a brief pause, Lizzie replied, “Not yet.”

“Then what the hell is he doing with that woman?” Mara burst out with frustration.

Lizzie gave a small, weary laugh. “Calm down. I was about to ask you to dinner when you called.”

“You at home? I’ll come pick you up.”

Smiling, Lizzie agreed. “Sounds good. I wasn’t in the mood to drive anyway.”

Mara arrived quickly. Lizzie took a quick shower, changed her clothes, applied some light makeup and was ready just as he arrived. They went to a cozy restaurant they’d frequented over the years.

Once they were seated and had placed their orders, Lizzie looked at Mara and said, “Help me find a good lawyer. I’m ready to end things with Adrienne.”

Mara’s concern was apparent, but Lizzie brushed it off with a small smile. “I’ve got a tumor in my brain and I’ll need surgery. I’ve already applied for my visa and will head to London as soon as it’s approved.”

At her words, Mara’s eyes filled with tears. “Since when? What did the doctors say? Have you told your parents yet?” She fired off questions, her voice laced with worry.

“The same day when Ophelia had her accident. The doctors wanted Adrienne there to sign, but he was rushing off to find her. The surgery’s risky, so I need family by my side. I’ll head home to have it done.”

Tears started streaming down Mara’s face. “Forget about him. No one is worth going through this alone. I’ll going with you.”

Lizzie gently wiped her tears, offering a comforting smile. “I’m okay, really. Don’t worry about me.”

When Lizzie returned home after dinner, Adrienne was sitting in the living room.

“Where were you?” he asked.

“Out for dinner with Mara,” Lizzie replied, setting down her coat, bag and shoes before taking a seat across from him.

“Adrienne, we’ve talked for years about making a wish trip together. Think you could go this year?” Lizzie asked, referencing the trip to Lhasa.

She’d once heard that couples facing tough times needed to go on such a journey to pray with sincerity and resolve the hurdles in their relationship. Adrienne had always dismissed it as nonsense, never taking her seriously. Now, with Lizzie bringing it up again, Adrienne sighed. “How many times did I tell you that kind of things aren’t real? Besides, with Ophelia in this state, there’s no way I can go. Not until after the New Year.”

His response didn’t surprise her, but he’d never even offered to go “after the New Year” before. In the past, she’d probably be thrilled, planning the tickets and itinerary. But now, she only responded with a quiet “Alright” and nothing more.

Adrienne was growing increasingly uneasy with Lizzie’s silence; she seemed like a stranger these days. His gaze swept over the room, feeling as though something was missing. “Did you take down our wedding photo?”

“Yeah, just giving the frame a clean. It looks a bit dusty.”



Adrienne was scrolling through her phone, both of them sitting in silence. Lizzie stood up, heading upstairs to freshen up.

After showering and drying her hair, she came out to find Adrienne sitting at the edge of the bed, holding her phone.

“Mara called. She said she got the lawyer. She’ll send you the details soon.”

Lizzie's expression faltered slightly. She wasn’t sure if Mara had said anything else. She gave a soft hum in response and noticed Adrienne was staring at her, as though trying to read her every thought.

“What do you need the lawyer for?”

Lizzie sighed, instinctively lowering her gaze. She calmly applied some essential oil to her hair.

“Helping out a friend.”

“You could've use Hodge. Why bothering Mara to get you one?”

Adrienne’s voice was cold. Lizzie responded, “I’m not really close to him. Besides I didn’t want to involve anyone from the company.”

The excuse felt surprisingly convincing and Lizzie almost surprised herself with how smoothly the words came out.

By the time Lizzie returned downstairs, Adrienne had already showered. She lay down and he followed soon after, but the moment they settled into bed, Lizzie didn’t even bother with her phone. She turned her back to him and lay still, silent.

Things felt different now. It wasn’t the same between them. Ever since he returned from Eastport, Lizzie had seemed distant. There was an awkwardness between them that hadn’t been there before. He turned to face her, reaching for her waist, pulling her gently toward him.

“Hey, what’s wrong?” he asked softly.

Lizzie stiffened slightly and Adrienne felt it. His mind raced as he realized they hadn’t been intimate in a long time. He moved closer, but Lizzie turned toward him and gently pushed him away.

“I’m tired. Let’s just sleep,"" she said, her voice quiet.

Adrienne lay back down, but a question lingered. “Are you mad about Ophelia?”

Lizzie pulled the corner of her lips into a tight smile. “Why should she be mad? Was she supposed to get angry at a tool being used?

“No.” She paused, adding, “Why would I be mad?”

The words hit Adrienne harder than he expected. Of course, she had every right to be upset—he had been spending so much time with Ophelia, even having her stay next door. Lizzie should be angry.

But she wasn’t.

Adrienne felt a knot tighten in his chest, his confusion growing. He didn’t understand Lizzie anymore.

“She’s an actress. This kind of scandal could destroy her career. There’s nothing between us. Don't believe what those people are saying.”

Lizzie recalled the post Ophelia had made and Adrienne’s words confirmed he’d seen it. But the fact that he didn’t stop her, making it like he was allowing it. When the media went crazy over the rumor that Lizzie had stolen Adrienne from Ophelia, Adrienne didn’t say a word. Now, what did the post mean?

“What did they say?” Lizzie asked, her tone flat. “I’ve been too busy, I hadn’t had time to check on the news.”

Adrienne let out a small sigh of relief.

“Well…it’s nothing. Just go to sleep.”

Lizzie closed her eyes, but Adrienne lay awake, restless. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. After a while, he slipped out of bed and headed downstairs. Passing the study, he pushed the door open, only to stop short when he saw the box in the corner had been sealed shut.

He froze when he saw the books Lizzie had organized were in a cardboard box in the corner, tightly sealed with tape. Then he noticed the photo frame from their wedding, lying at the bottom, but the photo was missing. He stood there stunned, processing everything that had been saw, before finally reaching for his phone. Ignoring the fact that it was midnight, Adrienne immediately called his assistant.

“Do you have Lizzie’s medical report?”



Colton Riggs' voice came through the phone, groggy: “Yes, sir, I have it.”

“Send me a copy,” Adrienne replied.

Once the call ended, Adrianne’s phone buzzed with a new message. It was Lizzie’s physical exam report. Everything seemed normal—aside from some mild anemia and a vitamin D deficiency. Adrianne knew Lizzie didn’t spend much time in the sun, so that wasn’t a big surprise. He felt a wave of relief that there was nothing seriously wrong with her health.

The next morning, Lizzie woke up to find Adrianne still at the house. Adrianne had always been a workaholic, even with Ophelia around, so seeing him here now, especially in the morning, was hard to believe.

When she came down the stairs, Adrianne quickly ended the call he was on and stood up from the couch.

“I’ve booked us a flight to Lhasa this afternoon. Pack your things. We’re leaving for the airport soon.”

Lizzie raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised by the sudden announcement.

Seeing her reaction, Adrianne added, “I just realized our wedding anniversary is coming up, so I thought we could take a short trip there to celebrate. We’ll be back before the New Year.”

Lizzie didn’t want to ruin the mood by asking about Ophelia—about what would happen to her if they leave her. Over the years, Lizzie had always been the one to plan everything—birthdays, anniversaries, even casual dates on weekdays. Whenever Adrianne had time, he’d spend it with her, but when he didn’t, Lizzie was left to figure things out on her own.

So hearing this sudden plan was like being hit by a thunderbolt—it was so out of the blue that it left her confused.

Was this guilt talking? Was this related to what happened last night? Lizzie couldn’t help but wonder. She took a deep breath and decided to go along with it, taking as the farewell trip.

After breakfast, Lizzie went back to the room to pack. The weather was cold, so she packed warm clothes and a few things she might need in case of altitude sickness. She packed quickly and before long, the driver was there to take them to the airport. Lizzie checked in, handed over her boarding pass and they moved through security without any problems. With time to kill before boarding, she decided to grab a coffee.

When she came back, however, Adrianne was nowhere to be found in the waiting area. At first, Lizzie thought maybe he had stepped away to use the restroom, so she waited calmly. But as boarding time drew nearer and Adrianne still hadn’t returned, Lizzie decided to call him.

When the phone picked up, Adrianne sounded out of breath. “Lizzie, I can’t make it. Just go without me. I’ll pick you up in two days.”

Lizzie froze, her hand shaking around her coffee cup.

“Why?” her voice barely above whisper.

“It’s Ophelia... she… she tried to kill herself.”

Lizzie’s mouth went open and she couldn’t find the words. She hung up the phone and boarded the plane to Lhasa alone.

While she was there, Lizzie visited the prayer wheel and made a wish—but it wasn’t the wish she had always hoped for, the one where she and Adrianne would grow old together. Instead, she found herself wishing for her own safety and health.

She didn’t contact Adrianne again while in Lhasa and he didn’t reach out to her either. He had promised to pick her up, but days passed with no word.

By Christmas night, their fifth wedding anniversary had come and gone and still, no calls, no texts—nothing. The trip had ended and their anniversary had passed. Lizzie wasn’t surprised. She didn’t hold much hope in the first place, but after five years together, her heart felt like it had been stabbed with a thousand needles—the pain was sharp and overwhelming, making her hard to breathe.

After returning from Lhasa, Lizzie went to see a lawyer Mara had recommended.

Since Lizzie wanted the divorce to happen as soon as possible, the lawyer suggested she talk to Adrianne first, have him sign the divorce agreement and then they could proceed with the paperwork. The division of property could be handled later.



Lizzie hesitated, the weight of her decision pressing down on her. Was now really the right time to bring up the divorce? The idea of facing the entire Lennox Family felt overwhelming—especially her in-laws. Mr. and Mrs. Lennox had always been kind to her, almost like second parents. She couldn’t help but wonder how they would react if they tried to persuade her to stay. She wasn’t sure how she would handle that kind of confrontation. She felt emotionally drained, every fiber of her being stretched thin from everything that had happened. The idea of hearing them out, of having to explain herself, was more than she could bear.

Finally, her voice broke through the silence. “What if I give you full authority? You talk to Adrienne to get his sign about the the divorce and I’ll come back to complete the paperwork. Does that work for you?”

Belinda, the attorney, didn’t answer immediately. She simply studied Lizzie for a long moment, her gaze calm and focused. Then, she nodded.

“Yes, we can do that. But I’ll need you to sign a power of attorney form and the contract,” she said, her voice as steady as her gaze.

Lizzie signed the papers, her hand shaking slightly, but she didn’t let it show. Once it was done, Belinda led her out of the office. They barely made it past the front door when the mob descended.

Milk tea, coffee and bottles came flying out of nowhere, splashing onto Lizzie’s head and shoulders. She froze in shock, her heart racing. She stood there, stunned, unable to process the sudden assault.

“You shameless homewrecker!” one of the girls screamed, her face twisted in anger.

“Rot in hell!” another shouted.

“Stay away from our idol’s man, you awful witch!” someone else yelled, her voice thick with hatred.

The insults rained down from every direction, sharp and unforgiving. Then, without warning, one of the women shoved Lizzie. She stumbled back, losing her balance and fell to the ground, the impact jarring her body and sending a shock of pain through her side.

“Hey! Stop it! What the are you doing?” Belinda’s voice cut through the chaos. She had turned back just in time to see Lizzie fall and without a second thought, she rushed toward the scene, pushing her way through the crowd of angry women.

“Security! Call the police!” Belinda shouted as she reached Lizzie’s side. One of the guards quickly pulled out his phone to call for help, while another rushed to assist.

Lizzie sat there, drenched in spilled drinks, her hair matted and tangled, her face pale and defeated. She felt humiliated, small, the weight of the world pressing down on her shoulders. Belinda helped her up, her voice sharp with authority as she confronted the women.

“What is wrong with you people? Do you realize that public assault is a crime?” she demanded, her tone cold and commanding.

The leader of the group sneered, her expression full of righteous anger. “A crime? We’re just giving her what she deserves for everything she’s done to our idol.”

“Your idol?” Belinda scoffed. “There are hundreds of idols in this country, girls! Is it Ophelia Bullock?”

“Who else?!” the girl retorted, her arms crossed defiantly.

Belinda raised an eyebrow, a knowing look crossing her face. “Did Ophelia send you?”

The girl stood even taller, her posture full of self-righteous indignation. “She’s too kind-hearted to stand up for herself. That’s why she’s miserable. This bitch has been tormenting her for years, but we won’t let her get away with it anymore.”

“Our Ophelia has suffered enough because of this witch!” another girl chimed in, her voice full of venom.

Belinda smirked, unimpressed. “Well, let’s see if Ophelia shows up to bail you out at the police station.”

At that moment, the police arrived and the crowd began to scatter, their rage fading in the face of authority. Belinda quickly took Lizzie back to the office, helping her clean up as best as she could. Lizzie’s body felt like it was made of lead, every movement exhausting. They made their way to the station and on the way, Belinda checked her phone. The video of Lizzie being attacked had already gone viral, flooding her social media feeds with hate-filled comments.

Lizzie’s eyes narrowed as she scrolled through the posts, her heart hardening with each hateful word she read.

“Ms. Sawyer,” Lizzie’s voice was icy, the resolve in her words as sharp as a blade. “I’m authorizing you to handle this as well. I want to file a defamation suit against everyone with more than five hundred shares or likes on those posts. And as for the ones who attacked me today? No settlements. I’m pressing charges against each and every one of them.”

Belinda nodded without hesitation. “Don’t worry, Miss Bradford. I’ll take care of everything.”

At the police station, Lizzie was barely holding herself together. The exhaustion was overwhelming and she could feel every ounce of energy being drained from her. After giving her statement, she slumped back in the chair, completely drained.

“Are you okay, Miss Bradford?” Belinda asked, her voice gentle, yet laced with concern. “Do you want me to drive you home?”

Lizzie shook her head, her voice distant. “Thanks, Ms. Sawyer, but I’ll walk. I just... need some time to clear my head.”

Belinda gave a quick nod. “I understand. Just take care of yourself.”

After watching Lizzie leave, Belinda sent a quick text to Mara:

“Lizzie Bradford is at my place. She doesn’t look well. I offered her a ride, but she wouldn’t take it. Do something about it.”

Mara, who had been in a meeting, read the message and replied almost immediately:

“Got it. I’ll check on her in a minute.”



As soon as Mara ended the chat with Belinda, she left the meeting room and dialed Lizzie’s number.

When she picked up, Lizzie’s voice sounded light, almost playful. “I’m fine. Don’t worry about me, just get back to work. We’ll grab dinner when you’re done.”

Mara couldn’t help but smile at the sound of her voice. “Lizzie, let’s ring in the New Year together this year,” she said, her tone sincere, yet full of a quiet anticipation.

Without skipping a beat, Lizzie’s reply was warm, unhesitating. “Alright, but you better not be working overtime.”

Mara chuckled. “I won’t. I’ll just bring my work home with me.”

Lizzie snorted, a soft, affectionate sound that made his chest tighten with something he couldn’t quite name. “Alright, get back to your desk then. I’m fine, really,” Lizzie added, as if to reassure her once again.

Back at the office, things were beginning to unravel for Ophelia. The video of Lizzie being attacked by fans had gone viral and now she was the top trending topic. Elaine Coleman, Ophelia’s manager, had come to meet with her to discuss the fallout and Adrienne, who’d been quietly sitting by, looked far from calm.

Elaine, trying to stay composed, addressed the situation first. “I’m so sorry, Ophelia...and Lizzie, for what happened. This isn’t your fault.”

Adrienne’s eyes were glued to his phone, the image of Lizzie—covered in spilled drinks, surrounded by chaos—on his screen. His face went pale as he pressed his lips together, his expression hardening.

“When did this happen?” he asked, his voice tight.

Elaine hesitated, glancing at him nervously before answering, “About an hour ago. Those girls are still at the police station right now.”

Adrienne didn’t waste another second. He immediately dialed Lizzie’s number, but it went straight to voicemail. His jaw clenched and without saying a word, he stood up, grabbed his jacket and stormed out of the office, heading straight for his car.

Ophelia, who’d been sitting silently, watched him leave with a mixture of concern and something darker. She turned to Elaine, her voice low and cautious. “Elaine, this is too risky.”

Elaine sighed deeply, her shoulders slumping under the weight of the situation. “This is the quickest way to get Mr. Lennox to choose between you two. You know, even though he’s with you, he hasn’t divorced Lizzie yet. If this gets out, what do you think will happen? How are you going to clean up this mess?”

Adrienne’s mind was racing as he drove toward the police station. The images of Lizzie, bruised and exhausted, wouldn’t leave his head. She’d come back from Lhasa without a word to him. She hadn’t asked him to pick her up, hadn’t called him, hadn’t said anything. And now, she was avoiding him entirely. Something had shifted and it was eating him up inside.

Before he could even make it to the station, he spotted her walking down the sidewalk, dragging a suitcase behind her. Adrienne’s heart skipped a beat as he quickly turned his car around, pulling up next to her.

“Lizzie,” he called out, his voice soft yet urgent.

Lizzie stopped in her tracks, her gaze flicking over to him. But it was like she didn’t even recognize him anymore. Her eyes were distant, unfocused—empty.

Adrienne felt his heart sink. This wasn’t the woman he knew. Without thinking, he threw the car into park, jumped out and rushed to her side. He grabbed the suitcase from her hand and placed it in the trunk of the car.

“Why didn’t you call me when you got back? I would’ve come to pick you up.” His voice was tight with worry.

But Lizzie didn’t answer. She opened the back door of the car and climbed in without so much as a glance at him, as if he hadn’t even spoken.

Adrienne stood frozen for a moment, then hurried around to the driver’s side. He started the car, glancing at her in the rearview mirror. She stared out the window, her face expressionless, her lips pale and drawn. She looked... empty. Tired. Like she’d been drained of everything.

Something was off. She’d lost weight. Her jawline was sharper than he remembered.

“Lizzie, are you hungry? Let’s grab something to eat,” he suggested, his voice gentle.

But Lizzie didn’t respond. Her voice was flat, barely audible. “Not hungry.” Then she closed her eyes.

Adrienne took a deep breath before asking, “Are you hurt?”

Lizzie slowly opened her eyes, looking sharp into the rearview mirror. He must have had seen the video. That’s why he was here, rushing to to her and acting all concern.



She was wondering if it was for her sake. Impossible. Surely, it was because the fans’ actions would reflect poorly on Ophelia, that he wanted her to drop the charges.

“If you’re here to speak on Ophelia’s behalf, save it. Those girls are going too far, they should be held accountable for what they’ve done,” Her voice was calm and unemotional and Adrienne felt a sense of strangeness.

“I’m not here to defend Ophelia,” Adrienne said after a short pause.

She replied with hum, as if she had nothing more to say to him.

They had barely arrived home, suitcases still untouched, when Ophelia appeared. Her hair was cut short, her cheek bandaged from what looked like a burn and she wore a patient’s gown, looking fragile and weak as she entered.

Elaine helped her inside with some difficulty and Adrienne rushed over—ignoring Lizzie’s presence to assist.

“Why did you come here dressed like this?”

Ophelia clasped Adrienne’s hand tightly, her voice faint. Ophelia clasped Adrienne’s hand tightly, her voice faint. “I want to apologize to your wife. I feel responsible for what they did. I should’ve managed my fans better. I can’t believe they were capable of this kind of violence.”

Ophelia turned to Lizzie with watery eyes. “Mrs. Lennox, I’m really sorry. I want to apologize on their behalf.”

Before Lizzie could respond, Adrienne interjected. “This isn’t your fault. There’s no need for you to apologize. Lizzie won’t hold this against you.”

Ophelia shook her head slightly. “Whether Mrs. Lennox forgives them or not is up to her. But I still have to apologize.”

Lizzie’s gaze shifted coldly from Ophelia to Adrienne, finally settling on their interlocked hands. Adrienne, noticing Lizzie’s stare, felt a rush of discomfort. His hand felt hot and he was torn between letting it go and holding it on.

“Miss Bullock, you are you and your fans are your fans. I don’t need an apology from you, but I won’t drop the charges. They acted recklessly and they will face the consequences.”

“Mrs. Lennox, they’re just kids. Kids make mistakes. Please, cut them some slack.”

“Why are you so insistent on letting them off the hook? Are you their parent?” Lizzie narrowed her eyes, taking a deep breath before speaking firmly. “Or… is it because you sent them?”

Her words left Ophelia pale and trembling and Elaine quickly jumped to Ophelia’s defense.

“Mrs. Lennox, you’re right. Miss Bullock is Miss Bullock and her fans are her fans. But we really just want to apologize. Please don’t throw baseless accusations at my client.”

Adrienne frowned, stepping to Ophelia’s side. “Lizzie, Ophelia would never do that.”

Without another word, Lizzie turned and headed upstairs, ignoring them entirely. Adrienne personally escorted Ophelia back next door.

Feeling hunger creeping into her stomach, Lizzie asked the housekeeper to prepare a bowl of beef stew. Though she was hungry, her appetite felt muted. After finishing her meal, Adrienne was still nowhere to be found.

Lizzie made her way to Adrienne’s study to retrieve the house deeds. As she moved past his bookshelf, she accidentally knocked over a small bear figurine. It hit the floor, the head popping off and scattering a pile of heart-shaped notes.

Curiosity got the best of her and she picked one up, reading it.

“Day 101 since the breakup and my wedding partner isn’t Ophelia. It could be anyone and it wouldn’t make a difference.”

She opened another note.

“At Mark’s wedding, I caught the bouquet and turned to see Lizzie’s bright eyes. On impulse, I confessed, knowing she’d say yes. Even when she later pretended to be indifferent, I could tell she loved me. I played along, indulging her pride.”



“After all, she is the person my parents wanted me to marry, so I should at least put on a show.”

Lizzie’s hands shook as tears streamed down her face unexpectedly. She reached for another piece of torn-up paper. It read, “We got married just as my parents wanted and while Lizzie is thrilled, I lie next to her feeling nothing but resentment. If only it were Ophelia instead. Maybe if she hadn’t existed, my parents wouldn’t have disliked Ophelia so much.”

The note went on: “I kept my distance from her and she acted indifferently. What’s wrong with her? She is so weird.”

Lizzie quietly gathered the papers, stacked them neatly and returned them to the display piece she’d found them in, securing the head back onto the figurine as if nothing had happened. She locked her bedroom door and broke down, realizing that her years of love for him had been a joke.

Adrienne disappeared for two days. When he returned, Lizzie was unboxing a package that contained her visa. She calmly tucked it away, noticing that Adrienne barely paid attention to what she was doing.

As Lizzie was heading out with her bag in hand, Adrienne called out, “Lizzie, can we talk for a second?”

She turned, her expression cool. “What is it?”

“It’s Ophelia... she took some pills. Tried to... well, they just managed to save her.” Adrienne looked torn. “I need your help.”

Lizzie paused, then walked over and sat down, saying nothing.

“I think we should get a temporary divorce,” Adrienne finally blurted. “Ophelia needs me right now.”

Lizzie’s gaze was steady as she nodded slowly. “Alright.”

“Do we need a certificate to prove it?” she asked.

“Yes,” he muttered.

“Well, let’s go get it then.”

As they drove to the courthouse, Adrienne felt an unsettling emptiness creeping in. He glanced at Lizzie, wondering why she’d agreed so easily—why hadn’t she even asked when they would remarry. Did she trust him that much?

“It’ll just be for a while,” he reassured her. “Once she’s better, we’ll undo it.”

Lizzie just nodded, focused on her phone, booking her flight. She noticed there was a flight that afternoon at three p.m. and if they could get the divorce certificate, she could fly right away—it happened to be a non-stop flight.

The divorce certificate was processed quickly. When they walked out of city hall, Adrienne turned to her, looking slightly ashamed. “Lizzie, I’ll also need you to make a public statement saying we’ve been separated for a while. To let everyone know that Ophelia had nothing to do with our split.”

Lizzie held the divorce papers in her hand, looking at Adrienne with a soft smile that soon made her eyes sting with tears. “Okay,” she murmured.

After dropping her off, Adrienne left to visit Ophelia at the hospital, likely to tell her the good news about his now-official divorce. Lizzie had already packed her things, so she quickly loaded them into a suitcase, double-checked that all her documents were accounted for and scheduled a pickup to ship everything out.

Her friend Mara took the day off to drop her off at the airport, giving her a final hug as she headed toward security. Once on board, Lizzie opened her phone and posted on social media, tagging both Adrienne and Ophelia: “Adrienne and I have been divorced for a while. Wishing him and Miss Bullock all the best.”

The flight attendant announced they were about to take off and as Lizzie switched her phone to airplane mode, she typed a final message for the world to see: “Goodbye.”

I'm finally upgrading my phone, and I'm honestly so tempted by the new TechWoven case. 
I really like the texture and the idea of moving away from silicone, but the whole FineWoven Saga has left me with some serious trust issues when it comes to Apple and fabric cases.

My biggest fear is water—or anything remotely liquid.
I'm not talking about dropping it in a puddle, but the everyday things:
1. Wet/Damp Hands: Does constantly grabbing the phone right after washing your hands (or when it’s humid/sweaty) eventually leave a dark, permanent stain/discoloration on the edges?
2. Beverage Drips: If I get a small drop of coffee, soda, or a bit of cooking oil on the back, will it come out completely? I'm looking at the [Sienna / Green / Blue] color, which feels high-risk for showing stains.

I know Apple has those cleaning instructions (soap, water, gentle rub), but for those of you who have owned the TechWoven case for more than a couple of weeks, what is the real, long-term truth?
Please share your experience! I'd love to hear specifically from anyone who has the lighter colors, or who has actually had to clean a legitimate spill.

Here’s what I’m looking for in a partner:
	•	Someone genuine and kind who values honesty and warmth

	•	Ideally someone with a sense of humor, because life is better when we laugh together
	•	A practicing Muslim who shares similar values and commitment
      •     Ideally, someone who lives in Amman so we can build life together easily.
	•     Open to adventure and exploring life together, building a partnership based on trust and loyalty
      •     Age ideally 23 to 27, the perfect match for a meaningful connection
	•	I’d love for her to be working, someone with her own drive and goals, so we can grow together and keep life exciting

1nrs913,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1nrs913/your_smile/,Your smile,"If things one day work, and move well, Id be thrilled to let you know how much I love your smile. It's so genuine. So pure. Your laughter, how much warmth you show after you drop your guard.

I hate to admit it, but in those moments when you smile or laugh, it's so hard not to look away but I have to. I'd probably be on Jupiter, staring in your eyes, and it would draw _way_ too much attention with our friends. I don't need that right now, and maybe you don't either. 

Like that one time at the food court where I made you laugh and I wasn't even trying. It took the strength of Sparta not to lock eyes with you. You looked like a masterpiece of His work, and just that one glimpse of your joy is etched into my mind, knowing He's always in control. I pull out that image when I'm feeling weak these days. 

The truth is, I am confident in you even though I'm uncertain of the future. I feel God's fingerprints in our interactions in the silence, in the laughter, in our brief moments of eye contact, and even in the awkwardness.

My friends think I'm absolutely nuts that I'm this patient. That I have options that I can pursue... and yet I don't. I'm adamant to keep my eyes set on you.

He is refining me in ways I never thought possible, and that for me is more than enough regardless of the outcome.

I will ask you for coffee when I feel His green light.. and maybe we can plan a bank robbery or something heh

1nrs8ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1nrs8ag/looking_for_advice_what_to_improve/,"Looking for advice, what to improve.","I was a frail sickly child. The most distinct memory from all those ceaseless doctor visits was that wretched antiseptic smell; a smell that reminded me of scalpels, sterile cleanness and what my childish mind deemed death intermingled with bleach. I used to imagine a great cauldron, seething and bubbling and at its edge a shadowy figure with dubious gestures sprinkling his nasty brew into it. That vile smell was nauseating, and each time I tried to resist, it overwhelmed me with its elusive metallic tang which lingered long after. I loathed doctors, and hospitals in particular; even with their starched spotless whites, they could not mask that horrendous stench which made every encounter an appalling task.  
  
Spirituality, fates, souls and the like held no sway over me. I attempted praying several times; once, I tried praying every day for a year in the hopes that some gears in my skeptical mind would finally click, in the hopes that some call from the heavens would descend upon me restoring my long-lost faith. Yet, the heavens remained mute. In the cold late nights, in the darkness of my room I felt nothing. Fate was something I could never persuade myself to revere. I did not believe that the order of events was in the hands of Gods, nor in some teleological nature of the cosmos, where things happened no matter what we did.   
O, I am fortune’s fool! For I have become a physician. Now, I stroll the very same corridors I once despised. The scent of hospitals no longer repels me as it did; perhaps repetition dulls the senses after all those laborious years in medical school.   
This surge of vivid imagery kept capsizing me into a daydream like state as I sat to my desk pen in hand, over a patient's chart. The ward was hazy and still tonight, save for the faint insectile droning of lamps and some feeble coughs of a half-sleeping sufferer. After I finished jotting down the last of details, I set the pen down and smoothed my coat and started for the night rounds. The corridor stretched before me gleaming under the artificial light. I walked, as I usually did, holding tightly the hopes of the sick and my own unanswered questions.  
What madness compelled me to choose this vocation ?   
The smell, the lights and the endless charts have become my cauldron now; and I was the one mixing brew in this cathedral of healing--a fortune's fool indeed.  
  
The night shift exacted its toll on me which called for a cup of coffee. I wandered the ward checking in with the junior physicians and nurses before finally heading downwards in search of that bitter rejuvenating drink. With a weary clank the elevator yawned open and I stepped inside, its descent hummed the usual mechanical hymn. As I stood there leaning on the frigid walls, I felt stifled, the air thickened and turned sultry and I sensed the cabin closing up on me. The lift halted with a shudder nearly throwing me off my feet and then it shot back at a vertiginous speed. Overhead the lurid glow blinked in a frenzy and I felt my entrails clawing to escape through out my throat. I clutched the side railings but the speed was far greater and tore my clammy hands free.Weightless, I was hurled at the ceiling pain flaring at the base of my skull. The lift grew dimmer, limbs numb, I slipped into unconsciousness.

1nrrtb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Tall-Particular196/comments/1nrrtb2/from_madurai_to_the_nation_how_madurai_famous/,From Madurai to the Nation: How Madurai Famous Jigarthanda LLP is Expanding Jigarthanda Across India,"Few culinary delights carry the same nostalgic charm and cultural pride as **Jigarthanda**, the refreshing drink born in the heart of Madurai. Today, what started as a humble street-side offering has grown into a nationally recognized brand **Madurai Famous Jigarthanda LLP**. With a vision to introduce authentic Jigarthanda to every corner of India, the company is scripting a remarkable story of tradition, expansion and entrepreneurial success.

 

**Humble Beginnings in Madurai**

Every great brand has a story, and for Madurai Famous Jigarthanda, it begins in the temple city itself. Decades ago, Jigarthanda became a local favourite thanks to its unique blend of milk, almond gum (badam Pisin), sarsaparilla syrup (nannari), ice cream, and a secret mix of Flavors. When compared to other drinks, Jigarthanda was meant to calm the soul as well as the body, particularly in Madurai's hot climate.

While trends in beverages change rapidly, people will always crave genuine taste and cultural connection. By sticking to the traditional recipe and refusing to dilute authenticity, they carved out a niche that would soon grow beyond Madurai’s borders.

 

**State-by-State Expansion**

The turning point for the brand came when Jigarthanda’s popularity began spilling over beyond Tamil Nadu. With increasing interest from neighbouring states, Madurai Famous Jigarthanda LLP designed a roadmap to take this regional specialty across India.

**Tamil Nadu to Karnataka**: Expansion first began in nearby states like Karnataka, with outlets in Bengaluru where people already had an appetite for South Indian delicacies. Jigarthanda became a natural complement to dosa and idli, quickly winning hearts.

 **Andhra Pradesh & Telangana**: Known for their spicy cuisine, these states embraced Jigarthanda as the perfect cooling drink. Hyderabad, Vijayawada, and Visakhapatnam soon became hubs where customers lined up to taste the “Madurai original.”

 **Kerala & Pondicherry**: With cultural similarities and shared culinary roots, these regions readily welcomed Jigarthanda into their food culture.

 **Future Vision**: The company’s goal is clear  **to establish Jigarthanda as a household name nationwide**, just like chai, coffee, or lassi. With steady growth in franchise outlets, that vision is becoming reality.

**Franchise Model Success**

One of the driving forces behind this expansion is the carefully structured **franchise model**. Madurai Famous Jigarthanda LLP realized that while brand identity and authenticity must be centrally maintained, local entrepreneurs play a vital role in spreading the product.

The franchise model ensures:

·         **Low-Cost Entry**: Entrepreneurs can join the network without heavy financial burdens, making it attractive for small and mid-level investors.

·         **Training & Support**: Every franchise owner is trained in preparation methods, storage, and customer service, ensuring the same taste and quality across outlets.

·         **Supply Chain Efficiency**: Key ingredients are centrally sourced and supplied to outlets. This maintains consistency while also giving franchise owners peace of mind about inventory quality.

·         **Marketing & Branding**: The company supports franchise partners with branding material, digital marketing campaigns, and promotions, helping them succeed in competitive markets.

This collaborative approach has not only grown the business but also empowered countless small entrepreneurs across states. By combining tradition with a modern business model, Madurai Famous Jigarthanda LLP has created a **scalable success story**.

**Quality and Authenticity Across Borders**

The biggest challenge for any regional specialty going national is **maintaining authenticity** Madurai Famous Jigarthanda LLP overcome this challenge by strictly following its original recipe while also introducing innovative presentation that appeals to modern consumers.

**Secret Recipe Integrity**: The brand ensures that its hallmark Flavors – from the richness of thick milk to the cooling effect of badam Pisin – remain unchanged. No matter where you sip Jigarthanda, the taste transports you back to Madurai.

·         **Centralized Quality Control**: Ingredients are procured and distributed under strict supervision, avoiding shortcuts that could compromise the product.

·         **Cultural Branding**: The name “Madurai Famous Jigarthanda” itself is a constant reminder of its roots. Even as it expands across states, the brand proudly carries Madurai’s heritage in its identity.

·         **Customer Connection**: Beyond taste, customers experience a slice of Tamil Nadu’s food culture. This emotional connection is what sets Jigarthanda apart from generic cold beverages.

The company has also started experimenting with **new formats** to cater to modern lifestyle demands while keeping the soul of the drink intact.

From a single shop in Madurai to a pan-India presence, **Madurai Famous Jigarthanda LLP** is a shining example of how regional food can achieve national recognition without losing authenticity.    By staying true to its roots, embracing a structured franchise model, and focusing on consistent quality, the brand is not just selling a drink it is exporting a piece of Madurai’s culture across India.

As more outlets open nationwide, Jigarthanda is poised to join the ranks of India’s most loved beverages. And every time someone sips that cool, creamy delight, they taste not just a drink, but a tradition that started in Madurai and is now uniting people across the country.

I’m worried that one bad jump or a toy thrown a little too hard might shatter the whole thing.

Has anyone here actually had one of these tempered glass tables for a while? How much abuse can they realistically take before something happens? I don’t mind being careful, but I don’t want to spend a couple hundred dollars just to constantly live in fear of it breaking or replacing it after a month.
