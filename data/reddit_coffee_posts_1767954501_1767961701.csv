A few days ago I came across an Instagram reel by Oh No Vinay, where he talks about whether certain brands are underrated or overrated. In one of his reels, he mentioned a coffee subscription platform called Aramse Coffee.

From what I understood, they ask you questions about your coffee palate and then send freshly roasted coffee based on your preferences. The idea sounded interesting, especially for someone like me who’s still exploring coffee and doesn’t want to blindly buy beans.

I received my first batch today — Barbara Estate, roasted by Corridor Seven (Nagpur) — and honestly, it’s soooo good. This is easily the best brew I’ve made so far.

I’m very much a beginner, currently brewing using a French press, and this experience has made me want to properly explore the coffee world through this subscription.",2,1767961195.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

1q86t3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1q86t3q/house_of_horrors/,House of Horrors,"I am not sure exactly why I am posting. I think maybe just to rant. I purchased a Home exactly a month ago. At my first several walk-throughs, and when I made my offer, the home appeared in decent condition and did pass inspection very well. As time went on the people living here allowed their seven dogs to come into the house and I don’t think they went back outside ever. This completely ruined the flooring. Because of this, the seller ended up having to pay me cash money to replace the flooring. We immediately ripped up all existing flooring and began replacing it. We deep cleaned and began painting every room. We had not yet moved anything into the house, as we began painting, we noticed a huge pest problem. Lots of mice for starters. We think no big deal trapped them and move on. We began moving in living room and bedroom furniture and renovated the bathroom to where it was very nice and usable. Then we noticed the cockroaches in the kitchen. Immediately, I freaked out and contacted the pest control company. They couldn’t get me in right away as it was right over the holidays. Then we found a mouse living in the stove. Completely eating all of the insulation out. And I pinpointed the cockroach problem to the dishwasher. Needless to say, I am getting all new appliances and have ripped out those while awaiting the new appliance arrival. The bug people have finally been here. A couple days ago we saw and killed six rats in the backyard. And this morning while I am having coffee, I have had three fleas jumping on me. We have no pet pets. I just need someone to tell me that with pest control and diligence, this will eventually be okay. I am so disgusted with the people that lived here previously. Buying a home is supposed to be a fun and nice experience. I feel like I purchased a house of horrors. ",1,1767961133.0,pestcontrol,1,1.0,False

So, unfortunately today due to the snow, the person who would have been around for my children whilst I was in London was unable to be around. Kids first always with me so without question I was not going to London or to see the show.

I was actually going solo BUT, seeing as everyone has been so gorgeous I am currently chatting to a very gorgeous human being, kind of get girly when he messages 🤣😊🦋, and maybe I hope, we will meet up. I have also made plans for coffee with new friends I have made, all because of my original posts.

The reason I called it a journey is because when I originally posted I never for a second thought it would blow up the way it did. How such amazing people would comment wishing me well. How many people wanted to know the outcome simply because they wanted something beautiful to happen to a stranger. This has made my life honestly. Then, there’s the connections I’ve made I have made a couple of friends and am meeting them for coffee in the coming weeks. And then there is a gentleman who I am very much enjoying getting to know 🥰. It’s authentic and genuine and just lovely.

Lastly, even today so I couldn’t go. I managed to get a refund for my train tickets which was great. However I couldn’t do anything about my tickets (totally understandable and they really did try bless them. I didn’t expect anything but thought it was worth the call)

So less than 2 hours before the show started I popped on Reddit here and in London sub reddits the info. The loveliest person messaged and is currently on their way to see the show! And providing me updates bless them not that they needed to 😊. Honestly the happiness it bought them to be able to go has given me more happiness than actually seeing the show myself it I think!

So anyway, thank you all so very much. For just being so beautiful. I’m sure no one wants more updates so I’ll end with this. You guys are just incredible. I am chatting to someone that I am attracted to 😍 I am meeting two new female friends for coffee. And I connected with another gorgeous human today who is off to see the show and hearing how happy they were is just the best!

Sending so so much love to all of you. Even the couple of haters I picked up! There’s enough for even you right now. I’m genuinely floating on happy 💖😊🥰💖",5,1767961071.0,derby,1,1.0,False

This one is gonna be long.

  
I (23F) brok up with my boyfriend (26M) last Wednesday morning of almost 4 months. I know, it's a short relationship compared to the other stuff here on Reddit, but I just wanted to hear some advice.

First some background information. I was kinda late with exploring love, sex and relationships. I had my first kiss when I was 18, all due to a guy my then best friend set me up with. We dated for 3-4 months I think, before he broke it off. He isn't important, he was a loser. 

When I was almost 19, I matched with a guy on Tinder. He raped me on the third date. It wasn't this big violent thing, I just froze and didn't give consent. It was my first time sex as well. After that, I was pretty sure I was asexual. I hated everything that was connected with private parts. I still kissed some guys when I was out with friends, but my dating life came close to nothing since then. I just didn't want to have sex ever again.

I got my bachelor's degree when I was 20 and started my pre-master when I was 22. During my pre-master, I wanted to work on the rape incident and went into therapy. I got emdr-treatment for I think almost 8 months. During late spring of my pre-master year, one of my classmates came with the idea to sign us up for a blind date event. Three of us went, I expected nothing out of it, but one of my dates was my (ex-)boyfriend. During those first 15-20 minutes we talked really open about everything. It was really odd, but we both felt like we were talking to someone that we knew for much longer. I told that I was in therapy, he told that he also had therapy a couple years ago due to depression. He was just a really nice, lovely guy. After that event, a couple days later, the person who organized it contacted me with saying that he (my (ex-)boyfriend) contacted her and asked for my number. I said she could give it to him and that is where we started to go on dates. I got to know, this really sweet, sensitive guy who wasn't afraid at all to talk about his past, his struggles with depression and his experiences in past relationships. He was more out-going and extroverted than I was, but I didn't mind. I tend to be a magnet for more energetic people, maybe because I am a little more on the introverted side. In the beginning I had my doubts if I was really attracted to him, I had this feeling I could maybe like him only as a friend. But during a summer festival evening (a big 7-days festival where my whole city turns into a festival) we were both kinda tipsy, not drunk, just enough to get the pressure off, we first kissed and that's when I was sold. I was over the moon during this stage. I told him everything, about my rape, about my therapy (which I wrapped up shortly after meeting him) and how I thought I was asexual. He was really understanding about everything and he told me about his past. He told how he had started at university when he was 18/19 but dropped out due to covid, something he hid for a lot of people for a long time. Around this time, he also had a relationship with his now ex-girlfriend. They dated for 3 years before he broke it off. He explained she was really toxic, she was really insecure and needed a lot of attention and would gaslight him when he didn't give her enough. The break-up was really messy. She didn't want to really accept it because she was still in love with him and during the period after (they still saw each other because they were in the same friendgroup) she was really horrible to him, trying to gaslight him and guiltripping him (she said she didn't eat due to the break-up). He also has this habit of putting his own feelings aside in favour of the other. He does this with family, friendships and relationships. I noticed this a little. He never really made a decision, he always asked me what I wanted. He did have all these ideas for us so I could meet his friends, family and where to go to on dates. But since he knew my social battery was a little smaller than his, he was always checking in when I started to get tired and wanted to leave. I found this sweet, but a little concerning because when I asked what wanted, leave or stay, he refused to answer. He always did what I wanted. 

In september, when I started my master, he officially asked me to be his girlfriend. During the first 1/2 months of the relationship, his behavior was really sweet and adorable. He wanted to see me a lot, even when I had tests and needed to study, he was always looking at little open spots in my agenda where he could hang-out with me. He was really good with words, he always told me when he thought I looked good, he was really fast with expressing when he noticed he started falling in love with me (this was only a couple weeks after our first kiss). And, one of the greenest flags I ever saw in a man, he really wanted to experiment in the bedroom with me. Because of him and my therapist I found out I maybe wasn't asexual after all and it was just one big trauma messing everything up. I wanted to explore what I liked in the bedroom and didn't like, and he was more than happy to do that with me. He expressed his libido was kinda high, he and his ex (they lived in the same dorm) had sex almost every day. But he never rushed me, he never forced me to do anything, even when he asked if I wanted to do something and I asked what he wanted, he didn't express it, sometimes he said yeah I want to do something but when I didn't than that was that, we didn't do anything. But when he did, he was amazing. 

During the third month (I think) I noticed little shifts in his behavior. It was like he wasn't in the honeymoon fase anymore. I found that a little fast, since we were only seeing each other for a couple of months, but I didn't think much of it. We did have our little disagreements. They weren't big, but they were there. When I said or did something he didn't like, he could get really quiet and distant. Something I really hated, it made me really insecure. When I expressed this, he was kinda taken by surprise and said there wasn't anything wrong. This only happend a few times, but they were there. 

After New Year's, he became more distant. He didn't text that much so after a couple days, I texted him, telling him I missed him. He came to me on Tuesday night, greeted me with a kiss as usual but after sitting on the coach and telling each other about the last couple of days, he dropped the bomb. He told me he noticed his feelings for me weren't as strong as in the beginning. He couldn't really explain what was the main cause, but there were some little things. He mentioned our social batteries and that I was faster tired than he was in social gatherings. He said he didn't mind, but it was something he found a shame. He also said he admired me that I was really good in setting bounderies, but that some things that he wanted to share with me, I just wasn't open to, which he found a shame as well. Then he came with the thing that broke me the most, he doesn't really see a future with me. He didn't really give words to it, but I could kinda guess why. I am in university, doing my master's, creating all these plans for a post-master, the job I want later, etc. He doesn't know what he wants yet. After he dropped out, he never started a new study and just took a job to make an income. He knows that he doesn't want to hold this job forever, but he doesn't know what else he wants. 

That one stung like a bitch, because we both agreed in the beginning that this relationship was for the long run. He said he didn't want to break up (yet). He wanted to take stuff a little slower, so he had time to work out his feelings. I mentioned, that with our different social batteries, when the time came to leave, he never expressed what he wanted, he always asked me. He said that's true and that was kinda a toxic trade he always had, something his ex really took advantage off. I said I was more than open to find a compromise in situations like that, but when he didn't express what he wanted I was powerless. He understood, and said if I could ask him more, he wanted to answer more honestly. 

I also have to mention that I have a slight burn-out due to my master. I dropped some classes to retake them next year, so that might be a big case why I was getting tired faster. But due to the dropped classes, I also noticed my energy getting back. 

When he told me all this, I have to admit, I cried. We hugged a lot and talked about how we saw our relationship for in the future. We came to the conclusion that all the things that needed to change, were mostly on him. He needed to express his feelings and desires more, which he agreed. I was worried, because I didn't know if he was capable of doing that. 

He did stay the night. We didn't have sex or anything, we just cuddled a lot in bed. I barely slept. During that night, I thought, I don't want this, I don't want to be put on hold, for him to figure out his feelings. How long do I have to wait? We did agree we would check in with each other every week or so to explore where we stood in the relationship, but what if he came to the conclusion that his feelings weren't there anymore? And what if they were? How long can the relationship stand from there, a month? A year? How long untill that 'future' is there and we still have to break it off?

At like 3 in the morning, I kinda concluded I wanted to break up. I didn't want this, it felt like I was just pushing something forward that was kinda inevitable. I deleted his picture from my phone background, I removed the heart next to his name, I removed his status in my contacts as my boyfriend and as my SOS-contact person. I was making plans in my had to give him his book back that I borrowed and to put in one of the pictures that we made in a photo booth during fall. 

When it was like 8:30/9, I stood up to get dressed. He stood up like 30 minutes later and asked how I slept. I said not good and broke down crying. He hugged me tight and softly joked about the (figural) mess we made. In that hug I said that it might be for the best if we broke up. We sat on the couch and I expressed I didn't want to wait, it was like pushing forward an execution. I mentioned that he needed to sort out for himself what he wanted in a relationship and how he should act in one, because now he had this behavior he had learned that his ex took advantage of and he still did it, distroying himself and me in the process. That was the first time I saw him cry. I said he was a good guy, really sweet with a heart of gold, and that no one should every convince him otherwise. That is when he broke down completely and was crying in my arms. I said that when he already has doubts, than I didn't think it would work out in the future, something he agreed on. I let him stay to eat some breakfast. After that we exchanged the things we borrowed from another. He gave me my key back and I wanted to give him his book, something he at first wanted to refuse, said I should finish reading it first and could always give it back later. I said I didn't want that, because than it would just be staring at me. I asked if he wanted on of the 2 photo booth strips that was hanging on my closet. He said he did. I went to pull of both, something he said he didn't expect that. He wanted to really stay in contact, but I said I first wanted no contact, so no texting, nothing. He respected that, he said it would be hard for him to not text me, but he would wait when I would text him. He really wanted me to do that, to catch up with each other in a month or so. He also said he didn't want me out of his life completely, he wanted to talk to me every now and then, something I didnt really have the answer to. 

Him leaving was really hard. I expressed I would always care about him and that I had a wonderful time with him and that I would really miss him. He broke down again and said he was really gonna miss me too. 

After he left I broke down completely. I first called my dad about it and one of the first things I said was that I regretted it, that I felt this really big emptiness. My parents are divorced so my dad could understand what I was going through. After my dad I called a close friend, she was really sweet. Later that day, I took a walk with two of my housemates through the snow and told them as well. They were really, really supportive. In the evening I told the other two (the two guys in our house) as well. In the evening, I called a classmate who also became a friend of mine. She was supprtive, but also a little though on his reasoning on why his feelings why less and he wanted to take the relationship a little slower. She called it bullshit reasons.

Right now I feel like I made the decision too fast. The ironic thing is, when I found out (due to a study coach) I had a minor burn-out, one of the things was that I saw my (ex-)boyfriend too much and that I didn't have time for myself anymore. I expressed this to him in november already, that I needed more time for myself so that might mean I could see him a little less. He didn't like it, but he understood. The doubts about the future, I actually had those as well. But I was also telling myself, fuck the future, I want to enjoy the here and now. I like the position we're in now, the future is something for, well, the future.

The things he expressed and wanted to change, were things I actually wanted to change as well. Right now I just feel like, I walked away too fast. He had doubts and I took the decision out of his hands with breaking it off completely. Meanwhile, now I had a couple of days to think about it, taking it a little more low-key, talking more about our feelings and what we want, was secretly something I was longing for as well. The first friend I called (she is a little older than me with more dating-experience) said there is nothing weird about that. My two (female) housemates that I told first, also expressed that could be a really normal and healthy way to explore each other some more.

Right now I just feel like I want to hear it more from him. Does he think splitting up and staying split up is the best? Does he want to give it another shot with the terms we talked about in the beginning? Does he maybe want to explore again, go on dates again, getting to know each other all over again? Does he maybe want to have some time to sort out his feelings and get back to me later?

The thing is, he doesn't know himself what he wants. He expressed his feelings were less, but when I broke up with him he was an absolute emotional mess. My dad said it too, he is giving mixed signals.

I texted him this morning, asking him how he was doing and if he was open to talk one of these days over a coffee or something. This was something he mentioned himself as well, that when we were both a little better, we could talk on a neutral ground or something.

Alright, that was a bloody essay. I just don't really know what to do. I feel like I let this wonderful, sweet person go too fast, I just made a decision because I didn't want to be put on wait. But right now, I notice I am open to trying again if he is up for it. I am more than okay with him working his feelings out and maybe coming back to me. But when he says it is for the better to stay apart, I am kinda okay with that as well? Than I just have an answer and I can heal from this. ",1,1767960946.0,u_Stunning_Heart5969,0,1.0,False

What are your tips for dealing with this issue?  

I've been on Zep for three months and that is my only side effect. I'm doing prunes, prune juice, Miralax in my coffee (tried Benefiber but that did not seem to do anything). I'm struggling to take daily Metamucil (as recommended by both my dietician and my doctor), it kind of makes me gag but that's probably mind over matter. I'm going to try and drink it through a straw and see if that helps. Also trying to eat more fiber-filled foods. I do occasionally take a laxative chew but I know that's not a great solution. 

About me, I'm F and 68. Feeling great for the first time in a lot of years on this medication, it's helping so much with inflammation and just overall - everything! I want to find a way to make this work for me. 

Any tips or encouragement that this will eventually resolve? Thanks and sorry!

1q86ny0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Umrah/comments/1q86ny0/worst_experience_flying_on_gulf_air_for_umrah/,Worst experience flying on Gulf Air - For Umrah,"I just flew for Umrah through Gulf Air with family and had the worst of travel experiences. To be noted that I have travelled in the past with Emirates, Etihad, British Airways, Saudi, Qatar and all are better than Gulf. We had our flight on 29th December from LHR to Bahrain and then Bahrain to Jeddah and return on 7th Jan through the same route so just a 7-8 days trip.

Our departure flight was okayish. I had 2 kids travelling (a 6 year old and 2 year old) but don't expect any goody bags for the kids. Called the air hostess since the person sitting in front of me had their seat all leaned back close to my face and hurting my knees, the air hostess said I can't do anything, I was all spiritual so just let all this go and was excited for my Umrah with family.

The worst part came when we were travelling back from Jeddah. My wife was 23 weeks pregnant but we weren't asked for anything when coming from London, but when returning, the staff said you need a fit to travel certificate. We told them that we had our ultrasound before coming from London and our midwife in the UK allowed us, but they said they need a note saying ""fit to travel"" otherwise they won't let us board. Please note we were there for 8 days only and somehow became unfit to travel. I requested them to assist us, none of the other airlines have this policy. The person said to me, pointing me to the right, there is saudia, etihad airline travel with that. We cannot do anything.

After requesting them multiple times, the girl on the counter told me that the supervisor is checking. I told her the supervisor is just sipping a cup of coffee and standing there, and she started laughing in my face. **Zero customer service**. She kept on joking about us something in arabic with her colleague and kept on giggling not seeing how visibly stressed we were. I asked them can we go to the airport doctor to get this. The supervisor told me that the airport doctor wouldn't give you this and you need to go the nearest hospital. I asked do you know which hospital should we go to, they said, any hospital. I asked them if you can keep our luggage we'll just come back from the hospital. They refused straight away.

We rushed on the taxi to the nearby hospital ""Jeddah National Hospital"" and the hospital said that they can't give us this certificate since they don't have the staff and told us to go to ""Saudi German Hospital - Jeddah"". We rushed there, the hospital was very helpful and did everything for us on priority, did ultrasound and checks and took around 30 mins to get the certificate. The hospital doctors were also saying to us that this is unexpected and they don't know why the airline is asking for this since the pregnancy is early mid term.

We reached back at the airport with the certificate at 04:20AM and our flight departure was at 5:10AM and then they said checkin is closed, we wouldn't let you board. I kept on pleading to them but they kept on saying no, this is your fault. You should have come sooner, I told them I was just here 1 hour back and you guys sent us to get this certificate. The woman said why you didn't go to the airport doctor, I said you guys said to me yourself not to go there, the woman brushed me off saying i cannot do anything.

This is how they refused us boarding the flight and we had to book another flight for later in the day through Etihad and Etihad didn't even check our certificate and let us board. We had to stay on the airport for 12 hours for the next flight with 2 kids. Etihad experience was wonderful, goody bags for the kids, checking up on us. All stars to the Etihad staff who helped us through all this.

My recommendation to anyone reading this, **never ever fly with gulf air**. This was the worst experience of our lives.

1q86nmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1q86nmk/i_confessed_feelings_to_a_coworker_months_ago_now/,"I confessed feelings to a coworker months ago, now I’m stuck between letting go and holding quiet hope","I’m a guy in my late 30s. I developed feelings for a coworker (27F) over time not through flirting or drama, but through shared interactions, late nights talking, coffee shops, board games, comfortable silence. It felt soft, familiar, and emotionally safe.

Because I didn’t want to slowly slide into a friend zone while pretending I was okay, I told her how I felt back in November. She didn’t reject me outright, but she didn’t feel the same way either. It was gentle, honest, and left the door unclear.
Since then, nothing has fully ended.

We still talk occasionally. When we see each other in person, there’s warmth, lingering hugs, inside jokes, ease. She’s never cold, never dismissive. At the same time, she rarely initiates, and when I’ve invited her out 1 on 1, she’s declined due to being busy, though always kindly.
That’s where I’m stuck.

Part of me knows that if someone wants to be with you, they make space. Another part of me feels that what we have isn’t nothing, it’s just fragile, cautious, maybe scared. I’ve stopped pushing. I don’t chase, but I don’t disappear either. I stay kind, present, and let things breathe.
I’m not heartbroken, but I do feel a low-level sadness, the kind that comes from caring without clarity. I’m trying to respect both her boundaries and my own dignity.

What I’m struggling with is this:
How do you tell the difference between patience and self-delusion?

Is it healthy to let something stay unresolved if it isn’t actively hurting?

At what point does “giving space” turn into quietly hoping for something that may never come?

I don’t regret being honest with her. I just don’t know how long to hold this middle ground before I step away for good.

TL;DR:
Confessed feelings to a coworker. No clear rejection, no forward movement. Ongoing warmth but no initiative from her. I’ve stopped pursuing and am sitting with the uncertainty, trying to figure out whether that’s emotional maturity or fear of letting go.",2,1767960653.0,bodylanguage,1,1.0,False

figured i'd share some ways my partner and i manage to afford living year-round in a high-tourist area. the cost is insane here, so you have to be creative and think seasonally. it's totally possible though.  
  
the biggest one is leveraging space. if you have a spare bedroom or an in-law unit, short-term rentals are the clear winner during peak season, like may through september. we list a small cottage on airbnb and vrbo and literally make enough to cover our mortgage for the whole year in about four months. key thing is to offer amenities people really want, like high-speed wifi for digital nomads during the off-season and some nice beach gear (chairs, umbrella, boogie boards) which lets you charge a higher nightly rate. when the tourists slow down in the fall, pivot to mid-term rentals for snowbirds or traveling professionals who need a quiet place for 1-3 months.  
  
but if you're not trying to rent out your house, look at the small stuff. parking is a total nightmare, especially on weekends and for local events. if you have a driveway, a dedicated garage spot, or even some unused space on your lot, you can make easy passive income. look into an app like prked to list it. people are desperate for a safe, convenient place to park that's usually way cheaper than a lot. hosts can set their own price and schedule, and it's super easy to list. for people coming down, they feel safer knowing their car is on someone's property, they skip the parking lot chaos, and they get closer to the beach, so everyone wins. it's a solid little earner.  
  
for active income, focus on services the tourists need.  
  
\- rentals: you can start small with bikes, scooters, or paddleboards from your backyard. people don't want to pack all that gear.  
\- tours/lessons: if you know the area, guided fishing tours, sunset cruises, or even just surf/swimming lessons are really popular and can be niche services that stand out.  
\- services: boat cleaning, photography for weddings and beach portraits, or even a mobile food kiosk or coffee cart get you right in front of the high foot traffic.  
  
also, look into tax stuff. with short-term rentals, you can often deduct a lot of expenses like maintenance, utilities, and even depreciation, which can seriously reduce your taxable income. consult an accountant for the specifics, but it's a big deal.  
  
hope this helps you keep your toes in the sand for cheap.",1,1767960512.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1q86krz,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1q86krz/a_sticky_note_in_my_apartment_made_living_alone/,A sticky note in my apartment made living alone feel less lonely,"When I moved into my apartment, I told everyone I was “fine.”  
Which was technically true. I had internet. I had unpacked a few boxes. I owned exactly one plate.

Most nights I ate something random, stood in the kitchen, and kept videos playing just so the place didn’t feel so quiet.

One night the elevator broke again. Management put up a sign apologizing. I don’t know why, but I added a sticky note underneath saying I could help if anyone needed it.

I immediately regretted it. I figured no one would actually respond.

The next day someone knocked. Then someone else the day after. Groceries, strollers, heavy boxes. Nothing dramatic, just people helping each other up the stairs.

After that, the elevator wall turned into a message board. Jokes. Complaints. Little notes between neighbors who had clearly been living side by side without really seeing each other.

One evening I ended up sitting on the stairs with an older neighbor. We talked, not deeply, not perfectly, just honestly. About quiet apartments. About keeping the TV on. About getting used to being alone.

Slowly, things changed. People started recognizing each other. Small favors turned into familiar faces.

Last week, the elevator finally got fixed. The notes disappeared. For a moment, the hallway felt empty again.

Then I found a note on my door inviting me to coffee with the neighbors.

I’m not great at small talk, and part of me still wants to eat cereal alone and scroll my phone.

But I think I’ll go.

Living alone didn’t change. I just realized I wasn’t the only one doing it.",1,1767960408.0,story,0,1.0,False
1q86kid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1q86kid/worst_experience_flying_on_gulf_air/,Worst experience flying on Gulf Air,"I just flew for Umrah through Gulf Air with family and had the worst of travel experiences. To be noted that I have travelled in the past with Emirates, Etihad, British Airways, Saudi, Qatar and all are better than Gulf. We had our flight on 29th December from LHR to Bahrain and then Bahrain to Jeddah and return on 7th Jan through the same route so just a 7-8 days trip.

Our departure flight was okayish. I had 2 kids travelling (a 6 year old and 2 year old) but don't expect any goody bags for the kids. Called the air hostess since the person sitting in front of me had their seat all leaned back close to my face and hurting my knees, the air hostess said I can't do anything, I was all spiritual so just let all this go and was excited for my Umrah with family.

The worst part came when we were travelling back from Jeddah. My wife was 23 weeks pregnant but we weren't asked for anything when coming from London, but when returning, the staff said you need a fit to travel certificate. We told them that we had our ultrasound before coming from London and our midwife in the UK allowed us, but they said they need a note saying ""fit to travel"" otherwise they won't let us board. Please note we were there for 8 days only and somehow became unfit to travel. I requested them to assist us, none of the other airlines have this policy. The person said to me, pointing me to the right, there is saudia, etihad airline travel with that. We cannot do anything.

After requesting them multiple times, the girl on the counter told me that the supervisor is checking. I told her the supervisor is just sipping a cup of coffee and standing there, and she started laughing in my face. **Zero customer service**. She kept on joking about us something in arabic with her colleague and kept on giggling not seeing how visibly stressed we were. I asked them can we go to the airport doctor to get this. The supervisor told me that the airport doctor wouldn't give you this and you need to go the nearest hospital. I asked do you know which hospital should we go to, they said, any hospital. I asked them if you can keep our luggage we'll just come back from the hospital. They refused straight away.

We rushed on the taxi to the nearby hospital ""Jeddah National Hospital"" and the hospital said that they can't give us this certificate since they don't have the staff and told us to go to ""Saudi German Hospital - Jeddah"". We rushed there, the hospital was very helpful and did everything for us on priority, did ultrasound and checks and took around 30 mins to get the certificate. The hospital doctors were also saying to us that this is unexpected and they don't know why the airline is asking for this since the pregnancy is early mid term.

We reached back at the airport with the certificate at 04:20AM and our flight departure was at 5:10AM and then they said checkin is closed, we wouldn't let you board. I kept on pleading to them but they kept on saying no, this is your fault. You should have come sooner, I told them I was just here 1 hour back and you guys sent us to get this certificate. The woman said why you didn't go to the airport doctor, I said you guys said to me yourself not to go there, the woman brushed me off saying i cannot do anything.

1q86fhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivingUncertainty/comments/1q86fhz/food_recalls_for_jan_9_2026/,"Food Recalls for Jan. 9, 2026","As of January 9, 2026, several high-priority food recalls have been issued or expanded, ranging from international baby food concerns to local warehouse contaminations. Federal health agencies, including the FDA and USDA, are urging consumers to check their pantries and freezers immediately.

Here is a summary of the major food safety alerts for January 9, 2026.

# 1. Major Global Recall: Nestlé Baby Food

In what is being described as one of the largest recall campaigns in the company's history, Nestlé has recalled over **800 baby food products across 60 countries**.

* **The Risk:** Potential contamination with **cereulide** (a bacterial toxin produced by *Bacillus cereus*), which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in infants.
* **Affected Brands:** Include Beba, Guigoz, Lactogen Harmony, and Alfamino.
* **Consumer Action:** Parents are advised to stop using these products immediately. While the contamination was reportedly identified in late 2025, public warnings in many regions were only fully realized this week.

# 2. Lead Contamination: Klong Kone Shrimp Paste

On January 8 and 9, the FDA flagged a significant health risk involving imported shrimp paste due to elevated lead levels.

* **Product:** Klong Kone Shrimp Paste (sold in 454g and 910g white plastic jars with red caps).
* **The Risk:** **Lead poisoning**.9To date, four children have been reported ill with symptoms including diarrhea and elevated blood lead levels.
* **Distribution:** Directly sold to retailers in **Iowa and New Jersey**, though consumers may have transported the product across state lines.

# 3. Unsanitary Warehouse Conditions: Gold Star Distribution

A sweeping ""catch-all"" recall continues to expand this week following an FDA inspection of a Minneapolis storage facility.

* **The Issue:** Investigators found widespread **rodent and bird infestation**, including droppings and urine, in areas where food was stored.
* **Affected Items:** A 44-page list of products including brand-name snacks (Dole, Pringles, Quaker, Kellogg's), canned goods, and ramen.
* **Location:** Affects approximately 50 retail stores across **Minnesota, North Dakota, and Indiana**.
* **Note:** This recall does *not* apply to frozen or refrigerated items.

# 4. Pathogen Alerts: Beef and Tamales

Two major recalls involving *E. coli* and *Listeria* remain active with ""best by"" dates currently or recently passed.

|**Product**|**Reason**|**Regions Affected**|**Key Details**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Forward Farms Ground Beef**|*E. coli* O26|CA, CO, ID, MT, PA, WA|1-lb vacuum packages; Use-by dates: Jan 7 & Jan 13, 2026.|
|**Primavera Nueva Tamales**|*Listeria*|CA, NV|Specific lots produced between Oct 2024–Oct 2025; check for date codes 10/22.|

# Summary of Action for Consumers

  


* **Check the Label:** Look for ""Establishment Numbers"" (e.g., **EST 2083** for the beef recall) and specific UPC codes on the FDA website.
* **Do Not Taste:** Never ""taste-test"" food to see if it is contaminated; many pathogens like *Listeria* and *E. coli* are invisible and odorless.
* **Clean Your Fridge:** If you had a recalled product in your refrigerator, wash the shelves with hot, soapy water to prevent cross-contamination.



# Categories & Major Brands Affected

If you purchased any of the following brands from small markets or gas stations in **Minnesota, North Dakota, or Indiana** between late 2025 and now, they are likely on the list.

|**Category**|**Major Brands Included**|
|:-|:-|
|**Snacks & Candy**|Pringles, Hershey's, Reese's, Twix, M&M's, Snickers, Skittles, Sour Patch Kids, Haribo (Gummy Bears, Alphabet Letters), Starburst, Airheads, Werther's Original, Takis.|
|**Pantry Staples**|Jif Peanut Butter, Nutella, Dole (Canned Pineapple/Fruit), Ragu, Chef Boyardee, Heinz, Kraft, Domino Sugar, Gold Medal Flour, Morton Salt, Maruchan Ramen (Cup & Packets).|
|**Cereals**|Kellogg's (Cocoa Krispies, etc.), General Mills (Cheerios, Chex), Post, Quaker Oats products.|
|**Beverages**|Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Dr Pepper, Sprite, 7Up, Gatorade, Snapple, Arizona Tea, Welch's Grape Juice, Coffee Mate.|
|**Medicine (OTC)**|Tylenol (500mg, PM, Cold & Flu), Advil (Tablets, PM), Motrin IB, Aleve, DayQuil/NyQuil (Liquid & Caplets), Alka-Seltzer, Benadryl, Bayer, Excedrin.|
|**Pet Food**|Purina (Dog Chow, Puppy Chow, Cat Chow), Fancy Feast, Friskies (Pate, Shreds), 9Lives, Meow Mix.|

# How to Identify Recalled Items

The recall specifically applies to products that passed through the **Gold Star warehouse**.

* **Excluded Items:** This recall **does not** include frozen or refrigerated items. It also does not include products shipped directly from a manufacturer to a major big-box retailer (like Target or Walmart).
* **Affected Locations:** The 50+ stores are mostly independent ""Halal Markets,"" ""Discount Stores,"" and ""Food Marts"" in the Twin Cities, Rochester, St. Cloud, Fargo, and Indianapolis.

>**Official List:**You can download the full, itemized 44-page PDF with UPC codes and lot numbers directly from the [**FDA’s Recalls & Safety Alerts page**](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts). Search for ""Gold Star Distribution.""

# Immediate Action Required

1. **Do Not Consume/Use:** Even if the packaging looks clean, the risk of *Salmonella* or *Leptospira* (from rodent waste) is high.
2. **Destroy the Product:** The FDA explicitly states: **""Products should not be shipped back to Gold Star.""** Dispose of them in a sealed bag.
3. **Sanitize:** Wash your hands and any surfaces the packaging touched.",1,1767959983.0,SurvivingUncertainty,0,1.0,False

1q86dax,https://www.reddit.com/r/CookbookLovers/comments/1q86dax/cookbook_recommendations_for_somebody_who_likes/,Cookbook recommendations for somebody who likes mild food?,"Are there any cookbook authors or regional cuisines focusing on foods that can be described as “mild”? I know this is a very niche preference, but maybe such cookbooks exist?

Here’s a list of things I really do not want in my food: capsaicin, piperine, onions, scallions, garlic, mustard, horseradish, ethanol, coffee beans, turmeric, cilantro, parsley, olives and olive oil… Basically, most of the popular spices and aromatics are firmly on my “nope list.” If something tastes sharp, pungent, or causes me to feel pain akin to burning in my mouth and throat, I really do not want to consume it.

I do like some of the spices and aromatics (dill, bay leaves, mint, cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa powder), and I do not think of myself as a picky eater. From broccoli to stinging nettle, pine cone syrup, or organ meats, I can happily cook a lot of rarely liked ingredients. For me, sour foods are nice. I love sauerkraut and sorrel leaf soup, I can happily bite into a whole lemon or eat sea buckthorn berries. Bitter is ok in moderation. I am yet to figure out how to make dandelion leaves palatable, but I do like some slight bitterness in certain contexts. I quite like lingonberries, green bell peppers, even bitter tea.

Anyway, here’s my problem: when it comes to my family recipes and dishes popular in my country, with trial and error, I have long since figured out how to cook those according to my preferences. But when I want to try new recipes from cookbooks, I can only make educated guesses about how any given recipe might taste and how to alter it to suit my preferences. When I look for new recipes, they almost always have some ingredient from my “nope list,” and I tend to just yoink said item from the ingredient list and otherwise cook the dish as instructed. But the recipe’s author tweaked their recipe with the expectation that these spices will be used, and just yoinking them often results in disappointing dishes.

Many recipes start with some bland main ingredient (white rice, pasta made from refined grain wheat, chicken breast) and add some stuff that is either (a) spices from my nope list or (b) full of saturated fats. Now, I love butter, cream, cheese, and salt as much as any other person. But these ingredients are not healthy (calorie dense and full of saturated fats), so I prefer to use them in moderation. If I can make my oat bran breakfast porridge taste nicer by adding to it various less healthy ingredients, ok, why not. At least the base ingredient is healthy. But cooking white rice or pasta seems sort of… pointless for me. Why bother if the main ingredient is not even healthy? Sure, butter, cheese, tomatoes, and other veggies will make a pasta dish taste nice, but what’s the point? I can just cook carrots or cauliflower instead and those are tasty on their own without requiring lots of calorie dense condiments.

Granted, if I could figure out how to make condiments, sauces, and seasonings that I do like and that are not full of unhealthy nutrients, I would be very interested, though. Are there any cookbooks for such condiments? That would be cool to discover.

More often though, I just start with flavorful ingredients. For example, if I cannot use an off-the-shelf bouillon cube (wrong spices), then I will make my soup from bone broth, smoked meat, and veggies. Instead of white rice, I much rather prefer black rice (lovely texture) or buckwheat (such a nice aroma) or barley. Instead of chicken breasts I prefer chicken thighs or wings. And pasta made from whole grain or legume flour at least tastes like something on its own, and I also do like the taste of most veggies, legumes, and mushrooms. And Maillard reaction always makes everything taste awesome.

There should exist some cookbook authors or regional cuisines that focus on dishes made from veggies, whole grains, legumes, meat and fish and do not rely on the usual popular seasonings to make these dishes taste nice? Maybe? Any suggestions? Advice would be highly appreaciated.

Anyway, I can also read books in German, French, and Italian. I can order cookbooks from any European Union online store; international shipping exists, and I have no problem with getting books published in other continents either. So anything goes in this regard.",0,1767959783.0,CookbookLovers,0,0.17,False

I'm not new to moka pots , I used one daily approx 3-4 years ago but over time I got lazy and switched to fully automatic machines. But after I spend some time on this sub I realized I miss the experience also full auto machines never give the same taste as a moka pot

Now I’m thinking of buying a new moka pot and I’m torn between the Brikka 4 cup and the Moka Express 6 cup

I tend to drink a lot of coffee (almost a full mug) but it doesn't matter, my main concern is the taste. I like my coffee rich bodied and strong.

In my country there is not much of a price difference between Brikka and Express

I want to know what is the real differences between the two in terms of taste and brewing? Thanks very much in advance",3,1767959778.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

1q86cvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1q86cvk/startup_working_group_london_if_any_interest/,Startup 'working group' London - if any interest?,"So, commented on another post that I would be interested in helping other HENRYs who are fed up and want to consider whether starting a business might be for them. I got quite a few messages and so wanted to see if this works - bear with me as I haven't done anything like this before. 

My dad had his own company and so I grew up seeing the highs and lows of that, but went into finance/capital markets, broking credit derivatives interbank and then working at hedge funds, mainly equity long/short as a trader with a small book. It was through the GFC and so very volatile, and while I loved the fast paced nature of the job I kept having to find new places to work as funds were dropping like flies. Eventually I started a small fund with 2 former colleagues from a bigger shop, and we road showed, finally getting someone to put $70m in as a seed investor (the good old days!). I was tasked with everything that wasn't investment related, from plugging in monitors, to signing up lawyers, prime brokerage, and developing our SOPs. I realised that actually what I enjoyed was starting the business, not all the other stuff. Fast forward 2 years and I was elbowed out of the fund, and was pretty tired out, so didn't want to continue working in this field. 

Eventually I started a cleaning company, as it was the simplest way to cashflow positively from day 1. That grew quite well and ended up having 98 employees into covid; before being decimated. Undeterred I pivoted and launched a couple of other property services divisions which are growing fairly well. When I started, running around, chatting up clients, and then rushing home to hire people and create invoices etc, it was honestly like being on drugs - I was so exhilarated and when things started to really grow the building of systems and managers to help was such a rush; I felt like I had completely found my calling.

Although there have been a few hiccups along the way (and I've made lots of mistakes), it's been phenomenal overall and I've never looked back at my old life and wanted to return. Your mistakes are your own problem only, and there are almost no politics which is refreshing too. I was able to spend months away working remotely in Japan, the Deep South, and in Europe surfing and having a great quality of life. Definitely some rough times too, losing big contracts and having to figure out how to manage that. The business even paid for my MBA over 2 years, and the earnings profile (personal allowance salary + dividends + pension + expenses/use of home) is a lot better than earning an equivalent wage on PAYE.

I have to say at this point, I am not a brilliant businessman or super smart, just have had a bit of an unconventional journey with it, and having seen quite a few posts in this group from clearly smart people who want to set up their own thing, I wondered if I could help. One thing I remember distinctly was, coming from a frenetic work environment where you often had to do a week's work in a day (earnings season fml!), I felt like I had a distinct advantage versus traditional owners of rival companies when I was growing, and I am sure other HENRYs would perform brilliantly in that way too. I'm not selling a course or anything like that, but in the last few years I've helped a few friends start companies and I really enjoy helping and advising. Eventually, if I get to a point where I sell my business, I'd like to consult/operating partner/non exec other people's businesses and try to help; this is where my passion lies.

So, I was thinking, maybe a meet-up, somewhere in SW London, where HENRYs could exchange ideas re startups. A coffee place or similar, not sure exactly on the format, but wondered if there would be some interest in trying this out? If so, maybe comment below, with any suggestions also very welcome, and will try to arrange something IRL for the end of January. Apologies for the long post! Ed",4,1767959745.0,HENRYUK,5,0.67,False

we all know exercise is ""good for us"" - that's not news. but what's actually happening inside your body when you don't move? it's not just about gaining weight or losing muscle tone. your body is literally eating itself from the inside out, and most people have no idea.

dr. gabrielle lyon (she's a functional medicine physician who specializes in muscle health) puts it bluntly: skeletal muscle isn't just for looking good or lifting heavy things. it's an endocrine organ. when you don't use it, your entire metabolic system starts to break down. and it happens faster than you'd think.

here's what i learned that made me get off my ass:

**your muscles are your metabolic currency**

most people think fat is the problem. turns out, it's actually muscle loss that fucks everything up. when you're sedentary, you lose muscle mass. and when you lose muscle, you lose your body's ability to process glucose effectively. this leads to insulin resistance, which is basically the gateway to type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cognitive decline, and a bunch of other shit you don't want.

source: ""forever strong"" by dr. gabrielle lyon. she's trained at washington university and the nutritional science initiative. this book completely changed how i think about fitness. it's not about cardio or being skinny. it's about muscle being your longevity organ. insanely good read that will make you question everything you think you know about health and aging.

**your brain literally shrinks**

lack of movement impacts your hippocampus, the part of your brain responsible for memory and learning. exercise triggers the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is basically miracle-gro for your neurons. without it, your cognitive function declines. you become foggier, slower, more anxious.

dr. john ratey talks about this extensively in his research at harvard medical school. movement isn't optional for brain health. it's required. people who exercise regularly have better memory, faster processing speed, and lower rates of depression and anxiety.

check out ""spark: the revolutionary new science of exercise and the brain"" by john ratey. he's an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at harvard. this book breaks down exactly how exercise rewires your brain chemistry. best neuroscience book i've ever read on this topic.

**you're aging faster**

sedentary behavior accelerates cellular aging. there's actual research showing that people who sit for prolonged periods have shorter telomeres (the protective caps on chromosomes that indicate biological age). you could be 30 but have the cells of a 45 year old.

movement triggers autophagy, which is your body's cellular cleanup process. it clears out damaged cells and regenerates new ones. when you don't move, this process slows down. garbage accumulates. inflammation increases. you age faster.

**your mental health tanks**

this one hit me hard. exercise is as effective as SSRIs for treating mild to moderate depression. the research is clear on this. when you move, you increase dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, all the neurotransmitters that antidepressants try to modulate artificially.

but here's the kicker: you don't need to become a gym rat. dr. lyon recommends just 30 minutes of resistance training 3-4 times per week. that's it. you don't need to run marathons or do crossfit. just move heavy things consistently.

**practical starting point**

if you're completely sedentary, start stupidly small. 10 pushups in the morning. a 15 minute walk after dinner. 20 bodyweight squats while your coffee brews. the goal isn't intensity at first. it's consistency.

the ash app is actually solid for building exercise habits if you need accountability. it gives you daily check-ins and helps you track patterns without being annoying about it.

BeFreed is an AI learning app from Columbia grads and former Google engineers that pulls from research papers, expert talks, and books to create personalized audio learning plans. you can ask it to teach you anything, like building better fitness habits or understanding exercise science, and it generates a custom podcast tailored to your goals. the depth control is useful, you can do a quick 10-minute overview or go deep with a 40-minute session full of examples and context. it also has this virtual coach avatar you can chat with about your specific struggles, and it'll adjust your learning plan based on that. turns high-quality knowledge sources into something you can actually absorb during your commute or workout. makes it easier to learn the why behind these habits instead of just going through the motions.

**the system makes it worse**

modern life is designed to keep you sitting. desk jobs, long commutes, streaming services, food delivery. everything is optimized for convenience, which means minimal movement. your body wasn't designed for this. you have the same physiology as humans from 10,000 years ago who walked miles daily and used their muscles to survive.

the mismatch between your biology and your lifestyle is literally killing you. but the good news is you can fix it. your body responds incredibly fast to resistance training. within weeks, you'll see improvements in insulin sensitivity, mood, sleep quality, and energy levels.

listen to the peter attia podcast where he interviews gabrielle lyon. they go deep on muscle-centric medicine and why prioritizing muscle health is the best longevity strategy. completely changed my perspective on what ""fitness"" actually means.

you don't need permission to start. you don't need perfect conditions or expensive equipment. you just need to move your body with intention a few times per week. that's the baseline for being a functional human in 2025.",1,1767959503.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False

Thought I’d share how it went in case it helps someone planning a similar trip.

**Day 1 – Old Town wander + pub food**

Arrived around midday and honestly just let the day unfold. No checklist, no rushing just wandering around the Old Town and seeing where my feet took me. The Royal Mile was definitely busy, but still had a good buzz to it.

Kept food pretty low-key for the first day. Ended up in a cosy old pub near Grassmarket purely because it looked warm and inviting. Ordered haggis, neeps and tatties (figured I’d regret it if I didn’t try it at least once) and yeah, it was actually really good. Not at all what I expected. Rounded the night off with a pint, and there happened to be some live folk music on. Totally unplanned, just one of those happy accidents that made the evening feel special.

**Day 2 – Castle views + comfort food**

Second day was the most packed. Went up to Edinburgh Castle in the morning definitely go early, queues get long The views over the city were worth it even if you’re not super into history.

Lunch was a small café near Princes Street soup and a fresh sandwich, nothing fancy but perfect after walking all morning. later that day walked up Calton Hill around sunset. One of the highlights of the trip.

Dinner was a cosy little spot in New Town. had fish and chips done properly  crispy, not greasy, and a side of mushy peas. simple food, done right.

**Day 3 – Slow morning + sweet ending**

Last day was slower. Walked through Dean Village, which felt like a completely different city quiet, pretty, and great for photos. Grabbed coffee and pastries from a local bakery nearby and just sat by the river for a bit.

1q866ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1q866ze/cost_of_living_question/,Cost of living question,"I am considering moving to Australia, specifically Brisbane, and while researching the cost of living—including rent, food, transportation, and basic necessities—I noticed a clear divide in opinions. Many people describe Australia as an expensive country to live in, particularly in major cities such as Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney, with Sydney often cited as the most expensive.

However, when examining the legally enforced minimum wage and comparing it to real living costs, this narrative does not appear entirely accurate.

Please take this analysis with a grain of salt since it's very hard to find reliable information online. Any guidance or help is more than welcome. 

According to FairWork.gov.au, the current national minimum wage is 24.95 AUD per hour. Assuming a standard full-time schedule of 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, with weekends off, the income calculation is as follows:

8 hours/day × 24.95 AUD = 199.60 AUD per day

199.60 × 5 days = 998 AUD per week

998 × 4 weeks ≈ 3,992 AUD per month

3,992 × 12 months = 47,905 AUD per year


This assumes continuous employment for 12 months in a perfect world where you are allowed to work 12 months.

At first glance, this income appears substantial, which naturally raises the question of taxation. Using the income tax calculator provided by MoneySmart.gov.au, the estimated tax payable on this income is approximately:

5,159 AUD per year, or

429 AUD per month


After tax, the take-home income is therefore:

3,992 − 429 = 3,562 AUD net per month, or

42,746 AUD net per year


This indicates that income tax at this level is not excessively high.

Food 

Using Costco Australia prices only, I calculated the cost of a reasonable and consistent diet.

Additionally, essential hygiene and household products—such as laundry detergent, body soap, toothpaste, and similar items—can be purchased in bulk from Costco. As a result, these products do not need to be bought every month, further reducing regular living expenses.

Vegetables and fruits are generally better purchased fresh and consumed the same day rather than bought in bulk. While bulk purchasing is valid for many items, fresh produce, greens, and vitamins remain essential for a balanced diet. Likewise, items such as desserts, coffee, and tea are part of everyday life—I personally have a sweet tooth. However, for the sake of keeping this example simple and focused on core costs, I will assume a basic, consistent diet.

The daily diet consists of:

Breakfast: 8 eggs, 0.5 litres of milk, bread

Lunch and dinner: chicken breast, pasta, and a simple white sauce


Daily quantities:

Chicken breast: 500 g per day

Pasta: 300 g per day

Eggs: 8 eggs per day

Milk: 0.5 litres per day


Monthly consumption and cost (Costco prices):

Chicken:

0.5 kg/day × 30 days = 15 kg/month

15 kg × 9.99 AUD/kg = 149.85 AUD


Pasta:

0.3 kg/day × 30 days = 9 kg/month

Bulk pasta ≈ 2.35 AUD/kg

9 × 2.35 = 21.15 AUD


Eggs:

8 eggs/day × 30 days = 240 eggs/month

≈ 0.28 AUD per egg

240 × 0.28 = 67.20 AUD


Milk:

0.5 L/day × 30 days = 15 L/month

15 × 1.43 AUD/L = 21.45 AUD


White sauce (bulk estimate): ≈ 30 AUD


Calculated monthly food total:
149.85 + 21.15 + 67.20 + 21.45 + 30 ≈ 290 AUD per month

It is also worth noting that Muval.com.au suggests a general monthly food budget of around 500 AUD per person. Even when using this higher benchmark instead of the calculated Costco-based total, food costs remain reasonable relative to income.

I will be using the recommended 500 aud per month in my final calculations.

---

Rent

A commonly recommended financial guideline is that rent should not exceed 40% of monthly income. With a net monthly income of 3,562 AUD, this allows for a housing budget of up to:

3,562 × 0.40 ≈ 1,425 AUD per month


Assuming rent of 300 AUD per week, the calculation is:

300 × 4 weeks = 1,200 AUD per month


Listings on RealEstate.com.au show well-maintained houses with backyards located 30 minutes to one hour from Brisbane’s city centre within this price range, with additional discounts often available through long-term leases.

I'm aware of the need to have a rent track record to be able to rent such places and most of the adds online are scams. Cheaper options are available through co living as in renting a room.

---

Transportation

Transportation is often assumed to be a major expense, particularly when living outside the city centre. However, according to Muval.com.au, a monthly public transport pass in Brisbane costs approximately 110 AUD.

This provides access to an extensive and reliable public transport network, making daily commuting feasible without the need for a private car. As a result, transportation costs remain low and predictable.


---

Monthly Expense Summary (Conservative Estimates)

Rent: 1,200 AUD

Food (Muval benchmark): 500 AUD

Transportation: 110 AUD


Initial essential expenses:
1,200 + 500 + 110 = 1,810 AUD

Monthly net income:
3,562 AUD

Initial remaining amount:
3,562 − 1,810 = 1,752 AUD

To logically account for expenses not explicitly included—such as utilities, internet, mobile plans, clothing, healthcare, entertainment, and other discretionary costs—I conservatively increase total expenses by 50% of the remaining amount:

1,752 × 0.50 = 876 AUD


Adjusted total monthly expenses:
1,810 + 876 = 2,686 AUD

Final remaining amount after all expenses:
3,562 − 2,686 = 876 AUD per month


---

Conclusion

Even after accounting for rent, food, transportation, and then conservatively increasing total expenses by 50% to cover all additional costs, there is still a meaningful financial buffer remaining each month. This suggests that, under a minimum-wage income and with reasonable financial discipline, living in Brisbane does not appear to be inherently unaffordable.

So, in the end, I suppose what I am really trying to say is: what are you on about? 😅

hey everyone, figured i'd share a few income ideas for anyone living close to a popular beach spot. the tourist season is a goldmine if you get creative and skip the typical summer job stuff.  
  
first, if you live nearby and have any unused space—like a driveway, garage spot, or even a grassy area that fits a car—you should totally look into listing it on an app like prked. honestly, parking at a crowded beach is a nightmare, and people will pay way cheaper than a lot to park on your property. it's super passive income, you just set your own schedule and price, and it makes cash from space you weren't using anyway. for the parker, it's safer, usually closer, and they skip the parking chaos.  
  
beyond that, there are a ton of active side hustles that thrive by the water.  
  
rentals are huge. you can start small with just a few coolers, umbrellas, and chairs, since families often forget the essentials or just don't want to drag them from home. if you have more capital, kayak or paddleboard rentals are really popular, and you can buy decent ones for a couple hundred and rent them out for a good hourly rate. for a more active role, teaching surf lessons or beach yoga classes is another great option if you have the skills or certification.  
  
mobile vending can be a winner, but check local permits first. cold drinks, ice cream, or pre-packaged snacks sell out fast on a hot day. a lot of people make a massive profit on just selling cold water bottles for a buck or two when they bought them cheap. or, you could get really unique and start a pop-up coffee or acai bowl spot for the early morning beachgoers.  
  
if you're into photography, the beach is the perfect backdrop. offer mini-sessions for families or couples at sunset. it's low-cost to start if you already have a decent camera and a good eye.  
  
you can also offer specialized services for tourists or locals. think about being a personalized tour guide, showing visitors the best hidden spots and local history that a big tour wouldn't. a mobile laundry service is also a neglected problem for people staying in facilities without one, which is an easy gap to fill.  
  
and don't forget the online/gig economy stuff that works anywhere but is in high demand in a busy town. delivery driving through uber eats or amazon flex is often busy in resort towns with lots of vacation rentals. freelance writing, especially for local magazines or travel blogs, is always an option if you have a strong writing background.

Can I fit a full bed and a large-ish study desk in here?,"I'd like to make my childhood bedroom feel more comfy so I enjoy spending time here, rather than seeking every opportunity to get out of the house. I'd also like it to look more adult.  

Unfortunately, I think I'm trying to fit too much into too small a room. The room's a mess, so what I have right now isn't shown, and I hope that also provides a clean slate. I'm open to replacing pretty much all my current furniture and belongings. My goals include (if possible) having a place to do schoolwork (need computer and two monitors) as well as a comfy spot to drink coffee/tea and read and write in the morning and evening. Maybe a corner desk would work here, with the monitors against the wall, and the side for reading/writing towards the window.   

I need to get a new mattress, so I thought I might as well upgrade from a twin bed to a full if I can fit it. I also need a computer desk since I'm in college. I almost want to just have a small desk instead for my laptop, but I have a big beefy PC with twin monitors, and I don't want to get rid of that.  
  
First pic shows the room layout without furniture. 2nd pic was me trying to fit a full-sized bed, computer desk, and a comfy chair for reading in IKEA's room designer, but it feels too crowded. 3rd and 4th were from fiddling with chatGPT to get an example of my room with natural wood furniture and foresty colors. I kinda like the 4th pic, but that's a twin mattress again, which feels a little small and also childish. I like the long computer desk it came up with in 4rd pic, but I think the scale's off and the chair doesn't fit.    
  
Of course it'll need some rugs and other small touches, but I think first I need to figure out the furniture layout.     
  
One other note: I have access to a smaller room too, approximately 6x10 feet. Unfortunately it has no windows and is very stuffy. I could put my desk in there, but that seems quite uncomfortable to study and realistically I probably would want my PC to be in my bedroom. I could also put the reading chair in and make it a mini library, but I'm not sure if that would be a nice environment.

Yeah. Hearing parents say they pulled their kids off social media.
That matters.
It means reality finally spoke louder than metrics.

I’m Aylar (32F), and I host Sunday walks for women in Paris. I started these walks as a way to connect in the city, meet new people, get some gentle movement, and have an excuse to cosy up in a coffee shop at the end.



I honestly didn’t know what to expect when I invited strangers to walk with me, but the group has turned out to be really warm and welcoming — and I’m excited to keep it going this year.



January can be a tough month — cold, grey, and not much motivation to get outside. So if you want an excuse to get some fresh air and good company, the first walk of 2026 is next Sunday.



**When:** Sunday 18 January, 11am

**Where:** central Paris - I’ll share the meetup spot a few days before with everyone interested.



If you want to join or just want to hear more, feel free to comment or DM me.



Hope to see some of you there!

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around some tables and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs
[And hopefully Snoo ](https://postimg.cc/B8vN5xJc)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. 
If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.

If I grind coarser, in the initial bloom phase the water go straight into the cup extracting nothing.
If I grind finer, bloom is ok but at three quarter of the recipe (let’s say minute 2 aiming for 3 minutes total) the water starts to go down like droplets.

I took one sip and for some reason my body and mind said "" I dont want this"" So instead, I made a cup of tea.

No waking up groggy, No crashes and biggest of all, i can sleep in Now? I've been and avid 4 am on the dot waking up no alarm clock for 10 years.(31) now I feel like I can sleep till 6 am.

So I could wake up a Lil groggy, have my espresso and I would bang out a 45 min moderately intense workout no problem. But with tea, I just want to relax in the morning or better yet, sleep.

figured i'd share some ideas on how to actually make some cash in those random 1-2 hour gaps you have between lectures. honestly a regular part-time job is impossible with a student schedule, so side hustles that are super flexible are the way to go.  
  
the easiest stuff is often micro-tasks and surveys. there are a bunch of sites and apps for online surveys and for doing little human intelligence tasks. it won't be a ton of money but you can literally do it for 15 minutes while waiting for your next class and the cash adds up quick for groceries or coffee. also look into paid research studies or focus groups, especially on campus, because they usually pay pretty well for just a few hours of your time.  
  
if you have an actual skill, freelancing is way better. if you're good at writing, graphic design, editing, or social media, you can find small gigs on platforms like fiverr or upwork. you can knock out a quick blog post or a small graphic design task in one of your longer breaks. same goes for virtual tutoring if you ace a class like calc or a foreign language. you can set your own schedule and only book sessions that fit perfectly between your classes.  
  
don't forget about campus jobs. see if your library or computer lab is hiring desk staff or cluster technicians. a lot of these jobs are famous for letting you sit and study while you get paid. i knew a person who got paid to take notes for a class they were already taking for free money. ask older students about the chill jobs.  
  
and this is a bit different but if you have extra space where you live like an unused driveway, garage, or even a storage unit, you can make totally passive income with prked. you list the space on the app for people to rent, which is super easy setup in minutes. you set your own price and schedule, and then you just make money from the unused asset without doing any work between classes or ever really.  
  
hope this helps anyone trying to cover textbook costs or just get some extra spending money.",1,1767957412.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1q85mmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GearUpGaming/comments/1q85mmu/the_budget_king_why_the_acer_nitro_v_is_the_best/,The Budget King? Why the Acer Nitro V Is the Best Bang-for-Your-Buck Laptop Right Now,"Remember that feeling? You’re in the final circle of *Warzone*. The gas is closing in. Your squad is screaming comms. You spot the enemy, you aim, and then... *stutter*.

Your screen freezes for a split second. By the time your laptop catches up, you’re already in the Gulag. Tragic, right? We call that **""hardware heartbreak.""**

It’s not your skill; it’s your rig. But usually, fixing that problem means eating instant noodles for six months to afford a $3,000 beast.

But what if you didn’t have to?

Enter the **Acer Nitro V (Model ANV15-52-586Z)**. Think of this laptop as the scrappy, younger sibling of those massive predator machines. It’s surprisingly powerful, it’s sleek, and best of all, it won’t bankrupt you. Whether you’re a student tired of writing essays on a potato or a console gamer finally ready to join the PC ranks, this might be your golden ticket.

Let's rip the box open and see why this specific **Acer Nitro V review** proves it's turning heads this year.

# The Guts: i5 Power Meets RTX Magic

Let's talk horsepower. Or, in this case, ""pixel power.""

Under the hood, the Nitro V is rocking an **Intel Core i5-13420H Processor**. If computers were cars, this wouldn't be a Ferrari. It would be a tuned-up hot hatchback that smokes luxury sedans at stoplights. It has 8 cores (4 Performance + 4 Efficient), which handles multitasking like a pro. You can have Discord open, Spotify playing your hype playlist, and your game running, all without the system breaking a sweat.

But the real star? The **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Laptop GPU**.

This isn't just a graphics card; it's practically a cheat code. Thanks to **DLSS 3 (Deep Learning Super Sampling)**, this GPU punches way above its weight class. It uses AI to generate extra frames in your games, making demanding titles like *Cyberpunk 2077* buttery smooth.

* **Real Talk:** The RTX 4050 is a huge leap over the older RTX 3050 cards found in most budget laptops. It’s the difference between playing on ""Low"" settings and actually enjoying the graphics on ""High.""

# Feast Your Eyes: The 165Hz Advantage

Pop quiz: What is the single most important spec for a competitive shooter? No, it’s not 4K resolution. It’s **Refresh Rate**.

Most standard laptops refresh their screen 60 times a second (60Hz). It’s fine for Excel spreadsheets, but for gaming? It’s like watching a slideshow. The **Acer Nitro V** comes with a blistering **165Hz refresh rate** on a 15.6"" FHD IPS display.

Imagine flipping through a flipbook. At normal speed, it looks okay. Now, imagine flipping through it three times faster. The motion becomes incredibly fluid. When you whip your mouse around to check a corner in *Valorant* or *CS2*, the image doesn't blur. It stays crisp. You see the enemy before they see you.

**Note:** The screen color accuracy (sRGB) isn't professional grade—it's decent for gaming, but maybe don't use it for professional color grading. For headshots, though? It's perfection.

# Design & The ""Vibe Check""

A gaming laptop can have the best specs in the world, but if it feels like a cheap plastic brick, you won’t want to use it. The Nitro V passes the vibe check.

* **The Look:** It has a futuristic ""cyber"" pattern on the lid. It’s distinct enough to say ""I'm a gamer,"" but sleek enough that you won't feel embarrassed pulling it out in a lecture hall or coffee shop.
* **The Keyboard:** The backlit keyboard isn't just for show. It’s crucial for those late-night gaming sessions when you don't want to turn on the big light. The keys have a nice bounce—tactile enough for gaming, but quiet enough for typing up reports.
* **Portability:** At around 4.6 lbs (2.1 kg), it’s not a featherweight, but it fits comfortably in most backpacks.

# Storage, Speed, and Upgradeability

Here is where we need to have a little honest conversation about the **8GB DDR5 RAM**.

Is 8GB enough? For now, yes. For the future? You might want to upgrade. The good news is that the Nitro V is user-friendly when it comes to upgrades. It uses **DDR5 memory**, which is the super-fast modern standard.

However, the storage is a total win straight out of the box. You get a **512GB Gen 4 SSD**. Gen 4 is *fast*. We are talking ""blink and you missed the loading screen"" fast. Plus, there is an extra M.2 slot inside, so when your game library grows, you can easily pop in another drive without deleting *Call of Duty*.

# FAQ: Your Burning Questions Answered

**Q: Can the Acer Nitro V run games like GTA V and Cyberpunk?** **A:** Absolutely. *GTA V* will run flawlessly on high settings. *Cyberpunk 2077* is demanding, but thanks to the RTX 4050's DLSS 3 technology, you can get very playable frame rates on medium-to-high settings.

**Q: Is the fan noise loud?** **A:** When you are just browsing the web, it's whisper quiet. When you are gaming? Yes, the fans kick in to keep that i5 and RTX 4050 cool. We recommend wearing a headset for the best immersion (and to save your roommates' sanity).

**Q: Can I upgrade the RAM later?** **A:** Yes! This is one of the best features of the Nitro V. It’s relatively easy to open up and add more RAM (up to 32GB usually) or add a second SSD for more storage.

**Q: How is the battery life?** **A:** It’s a gaming laptop, so don't expect all-day battery life. You’ll get a few hours for schoolwork, but for gaming, you **must** be plugged in to get full performance.

# The Verdict

So, is the **Acer Nitro V (ANV15-52-586Z)** the laptop for you?

If you are looking for a machine that costs as much as a used car, this isn't it. But if you are looking for the absolute **best value** on the market right now, the answer is a resounding ""Yes.""

It balances price and performance beautifully. It cuts corners only where it makes sense (like the starting RAM) and splurges on the stuff that actually matters—that gorgeous 165Hz screen and the RTX 4050 GPU. It’s a machine that respects your wallet but doesn't disrespect your gaming time.

**Ready to drop in?** Don't let ""hardware heartbreak"" ruin another match. Upgrade your setup and start climbing the leaderboards today.

I make an entry in it every time I get a cool gift idea. On a separate tab I have listed all gifts I've ever given and I rate em based on the receiver's response. I know this sounds really obsessive but i just love gifts so much cant do anything lol. 

Anyways, my mothers birthday is in a month so ive already set out on mission perfect gift (haven't finalized yet) but assuming people come here looking for ideas, I'm hoping this helps. Keeping this mom and grandma coded. 

(will make one for dads too next dw, just keep on a lookout)



**1. Nixplay digital picture frame (10.1”) 9/10**  
If your mom’s the sentimental type. Preload it with old family photos, little videos or a couple of notes. She won't even have to set it up, just plug it in and it starts playing.

\* Touchscreen, rotates automatically, and you can upload pics via app/email

\* You can keep adding stuff remotely, which is a low effort way to keep the gift alive throughout the year

\* She'll like it enough to just casually ask “have you sent anything new?”, trust me

\* Tip: take just candids and upload, moms love that

**2. Foot Massager bob and brads good 8.5/10**

For moms who work a lot or have got orthopedic issues. No mom is gonna ask for this directly but will love it if gifted. Also lowkey everyone in the family gets to use it then, good investment imo. 

\* feels like a real massage, like the vibrations go tissue deep, not just the buzz-y kind

\* Comes with heat settings and a remote

\* Not that expensive compared to others with similar specs

**3. Personalized bamboo tea box 7.5/10**

If you've got an almond mom lol or if she's just green tea obsessed. Honestly you could replace this with whatever she likes in specific(coffee etc), this one just looked cute to me.

\* You can customize the front with her name or a little message

\* Looks super cute on the kitchen counter

\* It’s out of stock sometimes, but worth checking around mother’s day or holidays

Pretty much the main summarized lineup, if you've got specific reqs tho ask away in the comments, I'd love to open my spreadsheet and help out. I’ve linked the products too so you don’t have to look for them yourself.

Like, I used to spend so much time on the boring parts of work—formatting docs, rewriting emails three times, debugging the same stupid errors. Now I just... don't do that anymore? AI handles it, and I get to focus on the stuff that actually matters.

My mornings in 2025 basically started with skimming AI news over coffee, then testing random tools—some everyone was talking about, some I found through obscure Reddit threads. Some were duds. But the ones that stuck genuinely changed how I work. I'm talking actual skill-building, not just ""it autocompletes faster.""

Honestly, the weirdest part is how normal it feels now. I don't think about it the same way I did in early 2024 when everything felt experimental. It's just integrated. And I realize I'm not even using the same tools my friends are—everyone seems to have their own little stack of AI stuff that works for them.

So I'm curious: what's one AI tool that genuinely changed your life in 2025? Not the obvious ones everyone already knows about, but something you discovered that actually solved a real problem for you.

###Internal Economic Memorandum — Coffee Production Expansion and Structural Stabilization

******
******

The continued performance of the external accounts during the first quarter of 1958 confirms that coffee remains, by necessity rather than preference, the central stabilizing commodity of the Brazilian economy. While recent diversification efforts in industry and transport are beginning to absorb labor and capital at the margin, foreign exchange inflows remain structurally dependent on coffee exports, both in absolute volume and in their capacity to smooth short-term balance-of-payments pressures. Under present global conditions—marked by persistent dollar scarcity, uneven European recovery, and volatile commodity markets—the option of allowing coffee production to stagnate is not economically viable.

The current expansion of planted area in the southern and central regions proceeds unevenly. Larger estates continue to reinvest mechanically, while medium and small producers face rising costs, credit constraints, and exposure to price volatility. Without intervention, this divergence risks reducing aggregate output growth while increasing political pressure from rural constituencies already sensitive to urban-biased industrial policy. The present approach therefore shifts from passive reliance on favorable prices toward active stabilization and productivity management within the coffee sector itself.

The principal objective is not indiscriminate volume maximization, which historically has contributed to price collapses, but controlled expansion combined with yield improvement and stock management. Credit policy is being recalibrated accordingly. Banco do Brasil’s agricultural credit lines are expanded in nominal terms but increasingly conditioned on productivity-enhancing investments—replanting with higher-yield varieties, soil correction, pest control, and transport access—rather than acreage expansion alone. This reorientation reflects both fiscal limits and the necessity of preserving long-term price stability in export markets.

Simultaneously, the state strengthens its role in coordinating production cycles. Through the existing coffee institutes and export boards, purchase guarantees and minimum price mechanisms are adjusted to discourage speculative planting during short-term price spikes while maintaining income stability for producers during downturns. Stockpiling capacity is expanded incrementally, not as a tool of market domination, but as a buffer against abrupt revenue shocks that propagate inflationary pressure through the broader economy. These mechanisms remain deliberately conservative in scale, reflecting both storage constraints and international sensitivities regarding market manipulation.

Infrastructure constraints increasingly emerge as the binding limitation on further gains. Internal reviews highlight that transport bottlenecks—particularly feeder roads and rail access from producing regions to ports—now impose higher marginal costs than labor or land. Accordingly, coordination between the coffee sector and the national transport modernization program is intensified. Priority allocation of rolling stock and port handling capacity is granted during peak export seasons, recognizing that foreign exchange timing is as critical as total annual volume under current debt and import commitments.

Labor dynamics require parallel attention. Seasonal labor shortages coexist with rural underemployment due to geographic mismatch and declining real incomes. The policy response remains cautious: wage floors are not administratively imposed, but credit and extension programs incentivize mechanization where feasible and labor retention where not. This approach aims to contain rural unrest without triggering cost-push inflation that would ultimately erode export competitiveness.

Externally, diplomatic and commercial efforts focus on stabilizing demand rather than aggressive market capture. Engagement with traditional consuming markets emphasizes reliability of supply and quality consistency, while exploratory discussions continue regarding managed agreements to reduce destructive competition among producers. These efforts proceed discreetly, acknowledging both geopolitical constraints and the limits of Brazil’s unilateral leverage.

Risks remain substantial. Overexpansion could still depress prices; underinvestment would expose the balance of payments; excessive intervention risks fiscal leakage and administrative overload. Bureaucratic coordination between agricultural, transport, and financial authorities remains uneven, and implementation capacity varies sharply by region. For these reasons, all measures are structured as adjustable instruments rather than fixed commitments.

A comprehensive review of coffee sector performance is scheduled for the final quarter of 1958, synchronized with the broader assessment of export earnings and import requirements for the coming year. Until then, policy proceeds on the assumption that coffee must continue to carry the external accounts—while being gradually reshaped from a source of volatility into a managed, if still imperfect, anchor of economic stability.

I would be really grateful if you could please take a look at my general itinerary plan below and let me know if there's anything I should add, take away or re-plan. I know some of this might seem a bit over-planned, but we'll obviously play it by ear and can move things around depending on what we feel like.

* Hoan Kiem Lake
* St Joseph Cathedral
* Temple of Literature

1q85g6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q85g6f/need_help/,Need help,"Having a terrible time

I've been up all night recently and have preoccupied my mind with drawing. But I don't get much done because I go into daydreams and while I'm in those daydreams I worry if I've done something to myself within that time period where I know I was just sitting on my chair. I fell asleep at 5 or 6pm and woke up at 11pm and started drawing and listening to Audible. I've had tea, water, biscuits, a scone, coffee, sausage all within a 5 hour period. 

 2 hours later I took my antidepressant but before then while I was waiting for a device to charge I looked for a post I found because I thought it was funny but it disappeared from my timeline and I freaked because I couldn't perform a mental ritual by seeing it jog my memory. I had been doing small mental rituals all night to the point my head hurts. I don't know how long I scrolled for maybe 15 minutes or at least a chapter of my audio book and I fear that if I forget to do a mental ritual or don't remember exactly the tangent I was thinking about, my brain will trick me into thinking I've done something I shouldn't. 

Now I'm trying to get back to sleep because I've suddenly become tired and my head hurts. I have a huge fear of dying in my sleep due to accidentally ingesting something I shouldn't have, underlying medical issues doctors might have missed or a messed up body clock that's given me a tumour because now my head hurts. Having OCD is horrible. I have these thoughts at least 5x a day. Sometimes more. I'm a healthy 26 year old woman and I constantly worry of dropping down dead. I am so unproductive with these thoughts. I stare at my drawing and prefer to drift to my phone or think of a million things at once until I feel like I've travelled through time because I've lost so much of it. I think I just need a kind word.

i figured i'd share some ideas since a lot of people move to the coast for the lifestyle but the costs can be rough. there are a ton of ways to turn your location into an income stream beyond just airbnb.  
  
the obvious one is short-term rentals. if you own a home, even renting it out for peak weeks when you'd normally be there can cover a huge chunk of your annual expenses. you have to be super focused on occupancy and setting the right price, not too high but not too low to leave money on the table. self-managing your property instead of paying a company a massive commission (sometimes up to 30 percent) is a way easier way to cash flow. look into tax write-offs too, a financial advisor can help with that since you can sometimes deduct mortgage interest and repairs.  
  
but here's a less obvious one if you have extra space like a driveway, garage, or even just an unused parking spot near a crowded beach or popular pier area. tourists and beachgoers are always looking for a quick, convenient spot and dealing with parking chaos is the worst. you can list that extra space on an app like prked. it's pure passive income and you set your own schedule and price. it's super easy to list and lets you make money from space you aren't using anyway.  
  
for other services, think about what tourists need right now.  
  
\- water sports rentals: jet skis, paddleboards, surfboards, umbrellas, and chairs are always in demand.  
\- mobile food/coffee: a small cart or truck with easy-to-grab snacks or coffee is a winner, especially if you can get a good location near the boardwalk or a busy entrance.  
\- tours and experiences: guided fishing tours, eco-tourism clean-up tours, or offering surf lessons are great ways to make money off local knowledge.  
\- photography: sunsets and the beach are a perfect backdrop. family portraits and engagement shoots are big business. get a nice portfolio and use social media to promote.  
  
you can also offer services to other property owners, like house sitting for luxury homes when owners are away, or even boat cleaning services. basically, anything that makes a tourist's trip easier or a homeowner's life simpler is a solid business idea. just check local regulations before you start anything.

1q85e4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1q85e4l/spent_4_months_building_a_free_ai_assistant_for/,"Spent 4 months building a free AI assistant for Mac → 7,000 users in 3 weeks"," **The Journey:**  

I started this in September as a weekend project to solve my own issue. Every time I needed AI assistance, I would switch to ChatGPT, which made me lose my context and flow. I thought, what if AI could just be right where I'm working?  

Four months and many late nights later, Ahsk is live.  



**What It Does:**  

Ahsk is an AI assistant that works in every Mac app. The main idea is really simple:  

\- Select any text anywhere  

\- The AI appears instantly  

\- You can ask questions, translate, rewrite, or whatever you need  

But it turned into something much bigger:  

\- PDF context loading (upload documents, and the AI references them)  

\- Screenshot analysis (press ⌥⇧S to capture and ask)  

\- Voice input (press ⌥⇧V for hands-free)  

\- Video downloader (supports YouTube, TikTok, Instagram)  

\- Lecture transcription  

\- Translation into over 50 languages  

\- Work sessions (maintains conversation context)  



**The Numbers:**  

\- Launched on December 19, 2025  

\- Reached 1,000 users in just 5 days, which was mind-blowing  

\- Surpassed 7,000 users by January 8, 2026  

\- Free tier offers 100 credits per month per user  

\- Currently, there are 226 paying users, giving a 3.2% conversion rate  

\- Revenue is around $3,000, which covers costs and provides coffee money  



**What Worked:**  

1. A genuinely free tier with 100 credits a month that is actually useful. People spread the word.  

2. Shipping features quickly, with a new one every week. Consistency builds trust.  

3. Using Reddit and Twitter as the best user acquisition channels, unfortunately, Meta ads did not work for me.  

4. Listening to users, as every major feature came from their requests.  

5. Building in public and sharing both successes and failures. People root for you.  



**What Didn't Work:**  

1. Paid ads, I spent $150 and saw no results.  

2. Cold emailing had a 0.3% response rate, which was disappointing.  

3. Trying to launch perfectly wasted three weeks on polishing instead of shipping.  



The Tech:  

\- React and TypeScript for the website  

\- Electron and Swift for the Mac app  

\- Firebase for authentication and database  

\- Stripe for payments  

\- Vercel for hosting  

The total cost to build was $0 since I used free tiers everywhere.  



**Best Moments:**  

\- The first user testimonial: ""This saved me a lot of hours this week.""  

\- Reaching $1,100 in revenue in the second week.  



Worst Moments:  

\- A crash in the first week that affected 400 users, which was tough.  

\- Realizing that macOS permissions are a real challenge.  

\- Late-night debugging sessions, which I can't even count.  

\- Feeling imposter syndrome every single day.  



Lessons:  

1. Ship before you feel ready.  

2. Free users can become your best marketers.  

3. Consistency is more important than intensity; weekly updates are better than waiting for big monthly releases.  

4. Actually talk to your users.  

5. Don’t give up in the first week when growth is slow.  



What's Next:  

\- A relaunch on Product Hunt this week, wish me luck.  

\- A referral program that gives 25 credits for each friend you refer.   (already there now)

\- Possibly a Windows version, as I’ve received many requests.  



The Honest Part:  

This is still a side project for me. I have a full-time job, and some weeks I feel exhausted and question why I’m doing this. But then I receive a message from someone saying it helped them, and that reminds me why I’m here.  

I’m not trying to build a unicorn; I just want to create something useful that helps people stay in their flow.  

Try it out at [ahsk.app](http://ahsk.app), which is free for macOS.  

I’m happy to answer questions about:  

\- Mac app development  

\- Using AI APIs  

\- Monetization strategies  

\- Growing without a budget  

\- Coping with late-night existential crises

I was half‑asleep when I shuffled to the front door to grab the newspaper, but instead of the usual stack of flyers, there was a **plain white envelope** taped to the wood.

There was **no return address** and no name in the corner. Just my street name scribbled in what looked like faded ink.

Curious, I flipped it over, half expecting it to be a note from a neighbor or some dumb prank. When I lifted the flap, a folded piece of slightly yellowed paper fell out.

That was it, no signature, no explanation. My heart kicked into overdrive. I stood frozen, coffee forgotten on the counter inside. A sudden flash of memories, arguments, and old friendships gone sour, as well as times I lied to myself that everything was alright, started rushing back.

1q85asa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoHelp/comments/1q85asa/as_a_beginner_trader_i_kept_missing_obvious/,"As a beginner trader, I kept missing obvious patterns while learning TA. Here's what finally clicked (and the tool that helped)","Hey everyone! I wanted to share something that genuinely helped me move past a frustrating phase when I was starting to learn technical analysis.

**The Beginner Problem I Had**

When I first started learning about patterns head & shoulders, ascending triangles, bullish flags, etc. I'd spend hours on TradingView studying historical charts. I could recognize the patterns after they formed. But when I tried to catch them *live* on multiple coins? Forget it.

Here's what would happen:

1. I'd wake up, check my watched coins
2. A perfect ascending triangle would have already broken out 2 hours earlier
3. By the time I noticed, the initial momentum was gone
4. I'd either FOMO in at the top or miss it entirely

The problem wasn't my knowledge it was **opportunity cost**. I couldn't monitor 20+ coins simultaneously while also working, sleeping, or doing literally anything else. So I missed patterns constantly, and it felt like I was always learning from missed opportunities rather than actual trades.

**What Beginners Need to Understand**

The pattern recognition itself isn't hard. Your brain can learn to spot an ascending triangle or a double bottom pretty quickly. The hard part is **timing** being in the right place at the right moment when the pattern forms.

Here's what the data actually shows:

* **Ascending triangles** in crypto have roughly 70-80% accuracy (depending on volume confirmation)
* **Bullish pennants** similar win rate
* **Double bottoms** around 75%+

But those stats are useless if you're checking charts every 2 hours and missing the breakout at hour 1.5.

**How I Fixed This**

I started using **ChartScout** to automate the pattern spotting. Here's the honest breakdown:

**What changed for me:**

* I set it to watch 50 coins across multiple timeframes
* Real time alerts hit my Discord when patterns form
* I get alerts in <20 seconds usually
* Costs less than a coffee per month on the paid plan (free tier available)
* No API keys = my funds stay completely separate

**What I actually do with the alerts:**

1. Get notification about a pattern (e.g., ""ascending triangle forming on SOL 4H"")
2. I look at the chart myself don't blindly trade it
3. I check: volume confirmation? Support/resistance levels? Broader trend?
4. If it checks out, I enter. If not, I skip it
5. If I miss an alert? No sweat, another one will form

**The most important part:** The tool doesn't make the decision. *I do*. It just stops me from missing patterns while I'm eating breakfast or at work.

**Real Talk About** r/CryptoHelp

This sub is about helping beginners learn correctly not hype. And that's exactly why I'm sharing this. You're in the right place if you want to learn fundamentals and technical analysis properly.

The problem you solve by having automated pattern detection is **psychological**: You can focus on *learning* patterns and your decision-making, instead of stressing about whether you missed one while sleeping.

When I started out, I'd see posts like I would have made $500 if I'd been awake when BTC hit that breakout and I'd feel terrible. Now? Those opportunities get caught by the tool, and I decide whether to act on them. Zero FOMO.

**For Beginners Specifically:**

* If you're learning TA from scratch, this frees up mental energy to focus on *why* patterns work, not on *missing* them
* If you're doing swing trading, the time-saving is huge
* If you're pure buy-and-hold, you probably don't need it
* If you have account restrictions that prevent active trading, no point

**The Catch:**

* It's not magic. Patterns fail. Markets surprise you.
* You still need to understand why a pattern works
* Volume context is everything the tool shows the pattern, you interpret the volume
* You can absolutely lose money using this. No tool prevents that.

**Bottom Line:**

As a beginner in r/CryptoHelp, you're already ahead because you're asking questions and trying to learn properly. If you find yourself doing technical analysis but constantly missing the live formations, it might be worth trying. They have a free tier with 5 pattern watchers—just test it out.

The real value isn't the tool itself it's the **clarity**. When you're not worried about missing patterns, you can focus on the actual skill: making good decisions when you *see* a pattern.

Would love to hear if any other beginners here have had the same experience—feeling like patterns are forming everywhere but only catching them after they've already moved. How do you stay on top of multiple charts?",1,1767956178.0,CryptoHelp,1,1.0,False

I want to meet a girl to go to museums with, to have coffee and talk deep topics on the balcony at 10 pm with, to go on weekend trips to Italy and see Roman statues and have authentic pizza with, but most of all, someone who simply enjoys my company as much I enjoy theirs.

1q85ae3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LahoreSocial/comments/1q85ae3/story_time/,Story Time,"I met this guy on Muzz. I joined the app with the intention of getting married. I liked his profile, he liked mine back and we matched. We talked on the app for two days, then we had a call. The dynamics aligned, everything aligned as in family backgrounds and other important things for marriage. We thought we should meet. I was insecure about my body. Not because I’m unfit…I’m actually quite fit but I still have personal insecurities. I told him he could meet me once and then decide. But he was like “nhi main woh nhi hoo who cares abiut physical appearance it’s all about hearts, tum ek ideal partner ho, ab jo bhi hojaye tum hi ho”.

Within three days of talking, he started saying things like “I miss you,” even though we hadn’t met yet. Initially, we planned to meet five days after we started talking, but he wanted to meet on fourth day so I was like ok. We met at a coffee shop, it was a nice meeting, He was like YOU ARE THE ONE! 
And tbvh he was literally what I wanted my partner to be so I said YES. We went and got permanent bracelets, it was his idea, “oh this this a promise bracelet, I will never leave you no matter what”. He dropped me back to university. 

Things were going great, week later he wanted me to meet his close friends group, according to him he never introduced any of his exes to his friend groups, said I was the one because he was clear that “ You are the one for me”. Met his group, they were super nice people, and are super nice till date, pure souls tbh. He met my friends, one of my friend warned me to take it slow and obviously I was taking it slow and seeing things. 
The friend groups aligned, we used to hangout alot. It was only the first month of our relationship. 

Between the first month, I posted a story of our friend group combined, to which one of my school fellow replied, “I want to talk to you about someone”. I was sitting with that man when i got this message, i was surprised because she was just an aquantaince nothing else. But he got panicked after hearing her name. 
She called me and it was on speaker, he was sitting next to me the whole time. She said “everyone in your story, I know them but this one guy Mr.X he is not a good guy, How do you know him? I went on a trip with all of these random people and this Mr.X accused me of false things and tried ruining my reputation in front of my guy and other people, He was high and all” 
I didn’t believe my class fellow because I blindly trusted Mr.X . I dropped him home i was calm , i reached home and he lashed out “you dont trust me why were you listening to her and all”  it felt weird to me, literally chorr ki daari main tinka, He was like you can ask any of people who were on that trip that she is making up stuff, And why do you care about past in first place. I asked his friends and they said yes she is lying. I remained calm, He made me block my own class fellow, He made a fuss that you aren’t trusting me even though i showed no reaction to any of it because i actually trusted him. 

Days later, I used to get him stuff, give him gifts, send him food made by me, send him flowers randomly. He never thanked or appreciated me the way he should’ve. I used to pay for every date, even once we had to gift something to one of his friends i payed for the whole basket, I didn’t see us as individuals in relationship so i kept on doing stuff out of love. 

1.5 month later, he told his mom about me. She was like “ she’s pretty and all”, i told my mom about him, day later his mom called my mom, you know how rishta thingys go. They decided when Mr.X will get job they will come officially to our place. But Mr.X was too busy, gaming at nights and not being serious about anything, as in his job. 
I just let things be, left it in God and used to pray deeply for his rizq and good job. 
2 days later, his mom added me on insta and my mom added him. That’s where in my opinion things took turn. One day, out of nowhere he started body shaming me and he kept on doing it for good 10 days, I used to cry infront of him and he didn’t care. Till i decided to face it and asked “ who said this to you?” and the answer was, “ dont hold grudges but my mama said this she is concerned about health so yeah” I responded “ didnt you say her anything i mean you love me the way i am” 
he said “ i did” which was clear bullshit agr usne kaha hota tou iss baat ki or bodyshame krne ki naubat hee na aati. 
I gave him a good shutup call that no one is allowed to talk like this about me, either take it or leave. He apologised. 

Things were getting normal, we were on call and having a deep convo, this man called me “toxic” I was like repeat it, he repeatedly said it for 4 times. I was in shock, because honestly everyone knows I can literally be anything but toxic. I had a whole breakdown and he didn’t care. 
He was stubborn, I had to make him realise that what he said was wrong, he gave a vague apology to it.
Things were going fine, but i started noticing that I’m the one always calling cheking up on him, treating him nice , showing gestures and nothing such is coming from his side, not even emotional support. He just used to ask me to sleep early so he could do gaming, and his own stuff I assume. He literally used to say “leave your phone, you should rest, sleep” It felt weird to me. He used to sleep poora poora din. He had random girls added in his account, he once asked me if it bothers me, I said yes, to which he said “ insaan ka loyalty test yahi hai k woh sb main ho k bhi loyal hai, main inko nikaal nhi skta phir tou bus ye account spam account lgge ga” What are youuu sirrr?? A divaa? Celebrity?
He admitted himself that there are random girls added in his instagram and snapchat, some are random and some he knows from discord.  He also admitted that he watched p^rn while being in relationship with me, Asked me once to change infront of him on video call, I refused and he said “oh its just me come on” 
I refused, I wasn’t comfortable, He claimed that he will watch stuff after shaadi too. 

One day, I was walking in park and a random guy, pulled off his pants and started doing bad stuff infront of me, I panicked and called Mr.X, hé consoled me first later said, “ kya hogyya hai shaadi k baad bhi tou main hrr waqt sath nhi reh skta, loug tou yay krrain gay hee” MTLB THE AUDACITY…… 
I ignored cause i was traumatised… 

Later, I used to send her mom flowers, home made cakes but never received a “thankyou” from her despite being added in her instagram,  it got cleared that she didn’t like me or she was just taking her son light because ye uska roz ka hoga, lrkiyaan and all. 
If he actually loved me , him being the only child and his mom being ethical enough would’ve show. some gesture or maybe a thankyou note at least.

I met him on his khala’s death anniversary and was there with him the whole day, he was close to her. I paid for everything made him feel comfortable. 
Few days later it was my dads death anniversary and he was tooo busy in his friends wedding, too busy that he could share pictures videos of the wedding, receive compliments from me but could not ask me if im doing okay. 
We used to talk daily, I used to call him he never made a call. I used to ask him to meet because we hadn’t met in past 28 days, we literally lived 10 mins away from eachother, he was just too busy making excuses. 
He had excuse for everytime i asked him to meet me. 

Oh and one day he said he is going to XYZ coffee shop with his uncle, I texted him that i might come to the same shop because my friends made a sudden plan, He responded quickly that he just reached home, they grabbed coffee and went home, but sir literally posted a story of the 1st floor of that coffee shop🤡.
He had time to do his own stuff but not see me, which clearly states he was upto something. 

One day on call, He was just talking about how his friend adored the permanent bracelet and he was like “ I asked her man to surprise her with it” I funnily said “when are you surprising me?” knowing the fact it had been over a month we did not meet. He lashed out on me “oh you compared me blah blah….” I apologised because i didnt want a fight tbh but he maded this a HUGE issue just because he wanted a point to leave me. 
He made a fuss out of it and kept on putting it on me that “tum soch lou” 
I was firm because till then I knew his games and what he is upto, He wanted to feed his fragile ego by this k ye mujhe chorr k gayi maine tou nhi chora, jbke itna mjboor krdiya k ye 3 months meri zindagi k sbse bure months thay tbh. 
I stood firm and said “ something like leaving wont come from me, I want to stay and this is my decision baaki aap dekhlo” to which he said yes he will let me know. 
Main mohabbat main andhi usko new year night pe lmba sa note or flowers bhej diye, he responded cold to it, I went cold after that too one day he messages me, and says goodluck I see no point in this, he called me , i said i really thought sb sahi hojaye ga i sent flowers isliye he replied “ woh apni mrzi se bheje tumne maine nhi kaha tha” call bnd hui and this was the end guys. 
but this man is still following me on insta, his mom is too, be upset i guess isne abhi apni mama ko btaya nhi k what he did and he wants to make me the bad person,
Posting sad stories to provoke me so that i remiove him and his mom and he can tell ber opposite story. 
But who cares. 

I feel like he was cheating on me, because no one becomes avoidant like this and not meet for a month despite things being really good inbetween. 
I really wanna know what he was upto but I have no idea how.

 To explain, I live in my friend's house—not my partner, just a friend. And there's really a lot that's possible with this house and property. My friend has given up on sharing her plans with me because she says I'm too unreliable.

 A brief example: she wanted to turn the garden into a kind of relaxation spot with a café, and I had all sorts of wild ideas. I'm aware that it doesn't always work out that way, but she seemed so overwhelmed by the idea that she and her uncle would prefer to do it themselves, but then asked if she could count on my help. I declined because I felt somewhat insulted, and I really didn't want to be standing behind the counter making coffee or talking to people.
In short, I was made unreliable, and she never actually went through with it. 

The second thing is, she asked me how I would feel more integrated here in the house and with them. I said it would be great if we could declutter the whole house and that I would gladly take care of the organization. There's still old stuff lying around from 1900, which is very antique and could be easily sold, appraised, etc. She was completely overwhelmed again and thought I might only want a piece of the garden and that would be it. In short, she said no, she would do it with her father, who then once again left her hanging and told her to do it alone. 

 What led me to have almost no contact with her anymore is that I see how stressed she is, how everything goes to her head, she lies to me, says everything is fine, then I hear her yelling upstairs that she has to do everything alone, even though I've offered my help so many times, but she still doesn't ask because she has high expectations of one person, etc. She projects her anxieties onto me, says my life is on the brink because I withdraw too much, and wants to tell me how I should raise my child. At the same time, she also asks me if I can look after her dogs, which I'm happy to do because the dogs aren't to blame, but I find that very questionable too, simply being away for at least three weeks during the holidays and handing over the responsibility to others, just because it's always worked before.

 I know I have to move out of here, but I'd just like to know what you all think and say about it. I look forward to a friendly exchange.",1,1767956119.0,hsp,2,1.0,False
1q85a51,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1q85a51/a_realistic_guide_to_approach_your_cat_preparation/,A realistic guide to approach your CAT preparation,"I am sharing my learnings and observations about CAT preparation. This post will be more useful for those that did attempt CAT this year and feel they can do better next year.

Please apply them in your case according to your strengths and weaknesses. 

Most examples given are my own performance parameters from last/this year.  



\> First step - Performance Analysis 

First part, look at your performance objectively as if it is a strangers score card. 

1. Do you have a clear strong and weak section in your result? Determine this by your sectional percentiles. Example - I had 95 in VARC and LRDI and 49 in QA 
2. Did you perform better or worse than your usual mock appearance? This is to determine if you underperform or overperform on D day. This can be sectional as well.
3. Do any sections need urgent care? These are those where you don't even cross the sectional cut offs(or hover just near it), in my case it was QA (49). 

Second is an introspective and somewhat subjective analysis.

1. Did you feel something distinctively lacking when you were doing the paper? In my case, QA - was slow and didn't know the tricks. In LRDI - wasted a lot of time representing data in wrong formats and everything looked cluttered.
2. Did you feel you had a clear advantage in some aspects? In my case, VARC - I could read and answer the whole paper. QA and LRDI - no concept seemed alien.



\> Step two - make your plan and start

Start with the urgent case section as soon as possible focusing on what you lacked. 

My case - I watched over 200+ R0dha videos on YT to get a grasp of all the concepts and tricks that I might be missing in QA. In LRDI, I focused on Cr@cku's content that discussed question types and ways to represent data. In VARC I saw let's solve together videos to try to figure out how I can increase my accuracy using usual option elimination techniques etc.

It's important you do these diligently with the intent to improve. Highly suggest making notes. Passively watching videos will not help. If you don't understand something, sit with it especially if you have more than 2 months till the exam. 

Next focus on application of what you learnt and practice to improve speed. Do untimed practice of sets/mocks trying to solve every question on your own. Can even use the marathon sessions of yt, pausing to solve and then seeing the teacher solve it - sometimes you may discover new/faster methods.

This is very boring, but essential to see if you've actually understood the concepts you've  studied. If something feels off, go back to your notes to look it up, watch some more content on it. The end goal here is to get comfortable, not confident, just comfortable with most concepts. 

The next step is to do timed mocks to check how you perform under time pressure and how your pace is. I advise avoiding actual previous year papers here. 

Keep applying quality mocks seriously, the time at which you take your test right now can be anything that is convenient for you - I used to do my mocks from 1 am to 3 am. 

By the time you're here you should already feel like a rough gem-stone. Now all you need is polish. 



\--> Step 3 - Polishing loop

After a while you'd notice you've settled into a groove (in terms of  marks/ percentile/ sectionals), if it's in the range you want to be then keep at it, if not then it's time to adapt. 

Take your first true test, attempt a previous year paper as seriously as possible. I went as far as sitting on the chair for half an hour staring at the screen to simulate how the actual exam starts. Have the nervous pee brakes and everything. 

Compare the score with that year's marks vs percentile. Ideally it should be better than your actual performance. My case - actual performance  92-93, first serious previous year attempt 96-97. 

Now it's time to focus on the micro thing - the paper attempting strategy, whether to use the calculator or do quick math, even things such as should I have coffee before the exam or not. I know these things sound stupid, but they help. 

The idea is to figure out how you can put your best way forward on D day. 

Examples from my case - 

1. Breathing exercise during the wait period helped me relax 
2. Coffee if had 2 hours before the exam made me feel quick in the first two sections, however I slumped in QA + it made my stomach upset, so I decided to skip it.
3. I was overthinking in VARC, so when I stopped over analysing the options my accuracy improved. 
4. In LRDI if in 5 mins I didn't have a clue, and in 10 minutes if I didn't see a way to solve it, then I should leave the set for later. 
5. In QA the advice of going for round 1, round 2, round 3 etc made me more anxious so I decided not to use it.
6. I started my QA from the middle of the paper, so that when I looked up with 10 minutes left to check at what all I've visited I saw that the “last” questions were done - very stupid ik, but helped me in remaining calm. 
7. The calculator was faster for me with fewer silly mistakes. 
8. I made a lot of silly mistakes in questions involving counting aka how many solutions etc - as I would get the correct range and then forget to count the first or last one. So I kept these questions for later. 
9. In LRDI, drawing huge tables helped me. I used to use the different corners of each box to represent a particular case - for example all top right values are for one case, top left for another etc. 
10. In VARC active reading helped me retain information from the RCs better. Sayali ma’am method of active reading for 5 minutes and then answering in 3 minutes helped me greatly.
11. In QA if I solved a question and my answer did not match any option then it was better to move on rather than find your mistake - I usually found it impossible to find. 
12. In LRDI if I was clueless on a set that seems doable it meant that I must've missed/misread something. So I would put it on pause and revisit it later. 
13. I tried to number the QA questions in the rough sheet so that when I revisit them I don't need to recalculate things. 

As you can see, most of these are very personal and minute - but helped me be sure that I was putting my best foot forward on D day. Nothing in your control should ruin your chances. 

Now for the loop part, of course all these observations were not made by a single test. I took a test and if I felt I needed to change something then I researched/brainstormed alternatives. Then I used them in some mocks/actual papers to see if they actually helped - if not I scrapped them and went back or again started looking for alternatives. 

You ideally want to keep tweaking things until you can. Ideally your last tweak should be a few days to a few before the actual exam. You wanna be confident and comfortable in your strategy.



\--> Step 4 - Being Realistic 

This has to go in sync with the previous step. As you perfect your approach you will again notice certain clear strengths emerging, and even a percentile emerging. You need to maintain them while trying to improve them. 

Your goal is to have a hard floor below which your percentile will not drop, and to raise this floor to a level where even on a bad day you'd convert something you'd wanna join. 

For instance, from my performances I knew that even if I screwed up the paper very badly, I would still be above 95+, if I did okay I'd be in the 97+, if I did reasonably well I'd be 99+, if I did very well I'd be in 99.5+, and if I had god on my side then I can even get 99.8+. Even a 95 should be enough to fetch a new iim, thus my performance floor was set. This gives you an air of confidence that is very much needed.

I’ll add another point here that there is no strategy that guarantees 100 or 99 or 95 or 90 percentile - if you aim for that you’ll end up feeling pressured to guess during the papers, this is usually counter productive as you’re removing the skill factor, and CAT rewards accuracy. Rather focus on giving your best, and you notice that you’re having more “good” days which each day getting better.

So each week/month compare to see if you’re better. It’s fine if you’re at the same level, that means you need to experiment more - it just should not come down.

Resource Suggestions -

1. Free content and coaching- there is a lot of quality free content present in the market, pick any teacher whose style suits you and who has good content. This is a good first step if you already have a base like I did. 
2. Coachings - If free material doesn’t suffice, then join any coaching that fits your budget - I do not have any recommendation here, most coachings have the same content with the only difference being how personalized the teaching will be. The old ones have more focus on basics with professional conduct, while many new ones focus on community learning and gamification. Both have their merits and choose which suits you.
3. Mocks- these are essential in my opinion, if not for the papers themselves then definitely for the user interface. Please do not go about solving previous year papers from a PDF, it will not be as effective as it can be. Mocks that also give your percentiles are useful as well, but not essential. I would advice taking that gives ample mocks + py papers + solutions (preferrably video - as i found many tricks through these)
4. Notes - there are plenty of “cheat cheats” and class notes/presentations, but I feel they don't compare to notes you make yourself. Don’t be a lazy pdf hoarder.

Additional points that you should know by now - 

1. Analyse your papers and your mistakes after giving a mock - this is more than half the battle. There is no prize for solving the most number of mocks.
2. How long you will take to achieve your goal percentile is dependent on you and your lifestyle - if you’re working and feel ill-equipped then a year long online course may be for you, making slow but continuous progress. I am sure you can figure out the other cases.
3. The free vs paid debate is also dependent on your lifestyle. Finding and utilizing free content usually takes more effort and time, so if you have time (are student/full time prep) then free is a good start, if you have some cash but no time then paid is the better option.

I have most of my  stuff on Proton but there are places like my local utilities that utilize email address as a user ID and thus dont allow me to change this. I can (and do) petition them from time to time to change this but yeah not on their priority list. Any ideas how can I make myself even more useless to Google ? 

* Socials: I have Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn because I need it for work. I removed all my private stuff and all of the apps from my phone. When I use them, its on Firefox. Do you know of any Firefox plugins that can limit those 3 somehow as to what info is collected by those platforms ?

* Phone: I use a Samsung phone with the Samsung Android flavour obviously. Im not going to throw it away and plan to move to something different when the device is obsolete but if you have any ideas how to make myself less attractive to Google please let me know

* Windows: I dont use it for ages as Im a IT professional thats working mainly on Linux (Fedora). However I do have a Win10 old laptop in the closet because I sometimes run the software to read off data for cars (Audi / VW) . Does anyone know if there is a Linux equivalent or somehow I can run it in a container / VDI on Fedora (I will take also Ubuntu if needed). Also if you can petition someone to make the software for Linux ;) 

* Amazon: Im fairly certain they are loosing money on me. I live in Poland and they are in a price war with the local online retailer so I pay like €9 per year only to basically watch Clarksons Farm and I use it on Twitch Prime every month. I also have a Kindle which I wont throw away because it works perfectly for me and I dont like generating ewaste. If you have any advice how to make myself less useful here let me know.

* TV: I do have a Samsung TV (Frame) bought recently. IIRC it runs Android and collects most likely way too much data on me. Any ideas how to improve my privacy? I did not allow most of the stuff when configuring it but for sure there can be more. Remove most of the apps? Is it possible to block some network traffic for the TV so it doesnt spy on me? 

Other than that, moving to EU made stuff this year was easier for me than expected. Clothes and food was easy to change habits. One thing where I faltered was with Ubiquity and I will need to buy some more of their stuff but as mentioned earlier Im not going to throw away working stuff just out of principle.

I struggled with my Magnifica S Smart (model [`FEB2533.SB`](http://FEB2533.SB) with the Long Coffee button) for a year, never quite getting café-quality espresso. I kind of gave up and settled with decent coffee. See my [older post](https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1h43g0u/i_think_there_is_something_wrong_with_my_delonghi/) for reference.

Then I stayed at an Airbnb with a Sage Barista Impress. After some grinder adjustments and proper tamping, I pulled amazing shots with my same beans. That experience made me realize I couldn't give up on my machine. I went home determined to dial it in properly, and here's what finally worked.

# Prerequisites

Read [How to Pull a Shot of Espresso](https://espressosetupbuilder.com/learn/how-to-pull-a-shot-of-espresso) for fundamentals.

# Steps

1. Set water hardness according to manual instructions and your region.
2. Use the integrated water filter and/or pre-filtered water.
3. Set temperature to maximum (should be close to 90°C on that machine).
4. Turn intensity dial to maximum for maximum ground coffee quantity.
5. **Adjust** **double espresso** **water volume to 35-40g** (see Critical Step below\*)
6. Gradually increase grind fineness from the factory 5 setting to lower settings (only adjust while grinding to avoid damage as specified in manual).
7. Wait 3 shots between grind adjustments for proper recalibration of coffee quantity by the machine (this is really important so that the machine knows finer grind means needing to grind longer to maintain the same coffee puck quantity).
8. Continue until you achieve proper extraction.
9. Fine-tune volume to taste. Grind settings should remain stable with the same beans.

Proper extraction can be evaluated by observing the following:

* Grinding the coffee for approximately 8 seconds.
* Extracting the coffee for about 30 seconds after the pump is activated, which should occur more than 20 seconds following pre-infusion.
* Allowing the coffee to drip slowly at first, producing the characteristic mouse-tail flow.

Taking personal taste preferences into account: if you enjoy it and think it’s good, then you’ve done it right! It’s not about the quality of the coffee drip or the firmness of the puck; it’s about getting coffee that you like.

# *Critical Step: Water Volume Adjustment

This is what made the difference after a year of ""failed"" attempts. I discovered it in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFWt_vcK6EM).

**The problem:** Default settings give 40ml (single) or 80ml (double) espresso. With maximum intensity, you get 8-9g (single) or 12-13g (double) of grounds. This ratio is too high for proper extraction.

**The solution:** Aim for 1:3 coffee-to-water ratio (12-13g grounds to 35-40g extracted coffee).

**How to do it:**

* Use a kitchen scale under your cup
* Select double espresso
* Adjust the water volume setting until output measures 35-40g

Once volume is set, keep up wth step 6 and up and dial grind fineness down gradually. I achieved proper extraction at grind setting 1.5, with the tell-tale mouse-tail drip and complete flavor extraction in about 30 seconds total.

# Extra tips

* When turning on your machine, put your cup bellow the dispensers. It will get hot water, and having an already hot glass is good for coffee taste.
* Use quality beans. But well, on my end I achieved better results with supermarket beans and I can keep my settings this way, so your mileage will vary.",1,1767955653.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False
1q855bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q855bz/how_to_profit_from_the_beach_economy_this_summer/,how to profit from the beach economy this summer,"  
  
hey all, figured i'd share some ideas on how to actually make some extra cash or even start a full-on seasonal business around the beach boom. the tourism market is huge right now, so there's a real opportunity to get in on it.  
  
first and honestly the easiest way if you live nearby is leveraging your unused space. beach parking is a nightmare, right? people will pay a lot to skip the public lot chaos and the hosts get to take care of the car while they're on the beach. you can list your driveway, garage, or even an empty spot on your lawn on an app like prked. it's super easy to set your own price and schedule, and it's totally passive income for space you aren't using anyway. it feels safer for the parker too since it's someone's property.  
  
for starting a real gig, rentals are always the go-to.  
\- beach chairs and umbrellas: this is low startup cost with fast returns. a decent chair is about $75 and a quality umbrella is $100. a set of two chairs and an umbrella rents for around $40 a day, so you pay off your investment pretty quick, like after 6 or 7 rentals. you'll need storage and to check local permits for operating on public beaches, though.  
\- water sports: think kayaks, paddleboards, and maybe jet skis if you're serious. this takes more capital and insurance, but the hourly rates are much higher. you could also offer surfing or swimming lessons.  
  
mobile food and services.  
\- food trucks or carts: this is big money maker. for a simple hot dog or frozen treat cart you’ll need county health approvals and a fire inspection, plus property owner permission to set up where you want. check your local city rules; some places have specific 'beach vending' permits. keep the menu simple to start, like shaved ice, specialized coffee, or easy beach snacks.  
\- photography services: a super low-cost option. offer family portraits or couple photoshoots at sunset. you just need a good camera and some editing skills.

hey everyone, figured i'd share some ideas since i live right by a huge theme park and have figured out a few ways to make that location work for me instead of against me (all that traffic tho, ugh). it's honestly not that hard to get some good passive income if you have a little extra space or time.  
  
first things first, the obvious one is short-term rentals. if you have an extra room, a guest house, or even an entire vacation home you don't use year-round, listing it on airbnb or vrbo is the biggest money-maker. but make sure you check your local rules, as a lot of places are cracking down on short-term rentals. to stand out, add little things like a nice coffee setup, fast wifi, or a unique theme. you can easily make $11,000 to $33,000 a year or more depending on where you are.  
  
but if you don't want strangers in your house, think about the space \*outside\* your house. this is where it gets really passive. if you have an unused driveway, a garage, or even just extra space on your lawn, you can rent it out. tourists and event attendees are always desperate for parking close to the attractions, and public parking is a nightmare. list that extra space on an app like prked. you just list your driveway or garage space, set your own price and schedule, and collect the passive income. it's super easy to set up and you can charge way more during peak season or big events like a concert or a holiday weekend. people who use it like that it feels safer than a random street spot and it's usually closer to where they want to go for way cheaper than a parking garage. you can also rent out a shed or a corner of your garage for storage, which is a steady monthly thing.  
  
another cool way is using your local knowledge. are you good at something? offer a service. you could do guided tours of lesser-known spots, like a ""best kept secret coffee shop"" tour or a nature hike. you could also teach a local skill, like a quick cooking class for a regional dish or a photography lesson. car rentals are huge too, you can rent out your spare car when you're not using it through a peer-to-peer app. or, if you're a good photographer, sell stock photos or videos of the local scenery online.  
  
the key is to think about what the tourists need right now. they need a place to park, a unique experience, or a place to sleep. if you can provide any of those, you're set.

1q8521a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgencyGrowthHacks/comments/1q8521a/building_an_outbound_agency_at_16_current_mrr_15k/,"Building an outbound agency at 16 (current MRR: $1.5K, goal: $10K by EOY 2026)","I started 7 months ago, and my agency model has evolved a lot since then. Total profit made is close to $10K.

**The model now:**

* Front-end: Book qualified meetings via cold outbound (email + LinkedIn)
* Back-end: Upsell to RevOps/GTM systems work

  
**My ICPs (so far):**

1. B2B SaaS companies (sales-assisted, not self-serve)
2. E-commerce performance marketing agencies / SEO agencies / content marketing agencies (has to be productized, boutique agencies don't need that much pipeline) 

  
**What I've learned building this:**

**1. Cold email still works (if you do it right)**

For an e-comm agency client, started working together in September, so 3 months ago :

* 2,500 emails/day across multiple domains
* 1-2% reply rate
* 22-28 meetings/month consistently

The key for this type of client: Category-matched copy (coffee brand gets coffee case studies, not generic ""I can help you grow"")

**2. Infrastructure matters more than copy**

Most people fail because they send from one domain and wonder why they hit spam.

Reality if you go with Google Workspace:

* 1 domain = 3 inboxes max
* 25-30 emails/day per inbox
* Need 14 domains for 1,000 emails/day
* 2-week warm-up minimum

I really do recommend doing more than 1,000 emails/day, because once you're still learning, you're going to book only 1 meeting every 5 days or so. That means only 4 meetings / month. Good agency has 20% close rate, meaning there is a chance you'll close 0 of them. You won't have any ROI and will say that cold email doesn't work.

  
**3. The upsell is where the real money is**

Once you're booking meetings, clients realize: ""Our ops are a mess.""

That's when you sell:

* CRM workflow builds
* Lead routing systems
* Pipeline reporting
* RevOps retainers

**Current challenges:**

1. Balancing school (A-levels) + 30h/week business work (acquisition + fulfilment)
2. Haven't hit $10K MRR yet (working on scaling outbound volume)
3. Hit 600 followers on Linkedin even thought it was created in July, but there are constatnt restrictions and support battles because I am under 18. Want to pivot to Youtube, already started filming content there.

**What's working:**

* Scalable Outbound, easier productization 
* Platform-agnostic positioning (works with HubSpot, Pipedrive, Attio, whatever they use)
* Vanguard 5 model (max 5 clients for quality, can elaborate on my plan if useful)

**Questions for this sub:**

1. Other agency owners doing outbound - what's your booking rate per 10K emails?
2. Anyone successfully upsold RevOps after starting with lead gen?
3. How do you balance quality vs. volume when scaling?

We started around 11:30 ish after namon order foods for our lunch. While waiting for our lunch, we obviously have the time to discuss. Nearly 1 pm when the food arrived and we resumed around 1:30. By 2pm, we started to order coffee while naga discuss kmi. Natapos ang amon order quarter to 4pm na sguro kay halos maka tatlo kapa ka follow up antis mag abot ang imo order - gina amat amat pa.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1q84yh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fisher_Factor/comments/1q84yh4/the_shit_sniper/,The Shit Sniper,"We play a game at the beach. You hold your shit until it hurts. Let the pressure build until your asshole is practically exploding. You climb, circle, wait for the perfect target. Then you let fly.

We keep score. Five points for a clean headshot. Ten if it lands straight in the gob while they’re eating chips. Twenty-five if you slip it unnoticed into a drink. Fifty if they swallow it. That’s legend stuff. The stuff of dreams.

I’ve led the ranking for two summers straight. I know the winds above Bondi like the top of my beak. The boys — Bazza, Kenny, and Skinny Wing — call me The Craptain when they’re sober off bin-juice. They call me worse when I lap them. But I give as good as I get.

Cheating’s allowed, because that’s half the fun. We tune the ammo. Chips make a nice spread but the shit goes too soft in the scorching heat. Meat pies are heavy in your guts, great for thump shots. Soft-serve gives you ribbon. Pretty, but useless for scoring.

The real magic comes from bad food, the stuff that makes human hatchlings cry. Grease and sugar. Hold it long enough, the pressure builds. You feel it chamber.

Bazza swears he once landed a turd in a bloke’s Dare iced coffee. “Didn’t even notice till the end,” he cackled, scratching the cigarette scar under his eye. “Gave it a little swirl. Classy.” 

“A two-for-one would beat it,” I said.

They went quiet, because we all know the myth: one shit, two hits. No one’s done it. Not here. Not anywhere. You need pressure, control, timing, and a lot of skill. It’s not something you can just fluke.

On the day I discovered fingers made the best ammo, Bondi was packed. Heat waves swirling above the sand. Tourists turning beetroot. Lifeguards in red and yellow blowing whistles.

A bloke with thongs and a trucker hat lifted a chip. It was the opportunity I’d been waiting for. Not the chip — the soft, fat meaty sausages attached to it.

I dove towards him. Beak open and ready. Feathers rustling. Wind at my back.

He never saw me coming. My beak snapped down. With a twist of my head, his ring finger was mine. He didn't even have a chance to scream. He stared, confused, as blood painted the sand red.

When his brain caught up, he screeched for an ambulance. The other humans yelled for help. The flock froze for half a breath while his chip bag fluttered down like a sign of surrender.

The beach erupted when I gulped the finger down whole. Bazza whooped. Kenny did a loop to loop while squawking “Legendary!” The humans ran. Sheltered in cars and shops.

A few hours passed. They slowly ventured back to the shore as the finger worked it's way through me.

I did a little test behind the surf club. A steep dive. A grunt. Muscles clenching. Pressure building.

Pop!

A pellet shot out of me like a bullet.

Crack.

Straight through the windscreen of a nearby Corolla. The alarm shrieked. So did I. My wings shook with pride.

Bazza flared beside me, eyes wide. “You forged that?”

“New ammo,” I said. “Call it giving ’em the finger.”

He looked at the car. Then back at me, laughing so hard he nearly fell from the sky. “Craptain, you really are a mad bastard.”

By afternoon, whispers had spread through the flock. The humans tried fish-and-chips diplomacy, scattering peace-offerings in greasy arcs. We took them. Food is fuel after all.

But our game wasn’t over. We went back to work.

“Keep it in, boys,” I called, looping above the flags. “Pick your angles. Check the flags. There’s a bit of cross-shore wind. Small amount of lift, make sure to adjust your aim.”

A backpacker lifted her phone for a selfie. Skinny Wing dived, twisted, shot one off. A perfect arc. It splattered across the screen. He landed on the rail, puffed, and posed like a pelican.

As a lifeguard blasted his whistle, Kenny coated it white. It dropped straight into his mouth. Ten points; the guard coughed until he collapsed. The flock howled like wolves.

Then the fun really began. A teenager with a hot chip in one hand and bubble tea in the other screamed. Bazza spied his gaping mouth, went vertical, stalled, and dropped a neat white present down the kid’s throat. The kid turned green, staggered to the bins, and power-spewed.

The crew shook the air with their beaks. “Leaderboard!” they screamed. “Leaderboard!”

I waited until all eyes turned to me. A champion at his peak.

From up high the blood on the sand looked like freckled skin. Tourists ran to their cars under a hail of crap.

The flock exploded as one, chanting like gods.

I felt the weight building in me again. Heavier. Thicker. Stronger. The wind settled. The flags made a V. Everything arranged itself like a divine gift.

Target one: a loud man by the guard tower, arguing into a phone. Mouth wide. Sunburnt. Tongue swinging like it was trying to get my attention. Target two: an influencer in a tight black bikini. Boost Juice balanced on her knee. Snapping selfies. Battering her eyes. Taking tiny sips.

The distance. The angle. The way the breeze folded at the edge of the walkway. It was perfect.

Bazza coasted on the air currents beside me. “You thinking what I’m thinking?”

“I’ve been thinking it since the day I hatched,” I said.

I climbed until the waves looked flat and cries disappeared. The world sharpened to one mouth, one juice, and the invisible line between them. I tipped my wings and dropped.

Wind forced my head back. Railings rushed closer. Fillings glinted from the man’s teeth.

I waited until the last moment. Took a deep breath. Pushed with everything I had. Whimpered as my sphincter tightened. Just as I thought I was about to explode the finger frag shot out of me, heading straight towards him. The pellet ricocheted off his teeth and kept going. The angle and the breeze did the rest. It zipped low like a skipped stone, plunging into the influencer’s juice with barely a ripple.

There was a single, beautiful moment where time seemed to slow. The flock stopped and fell silent. Even the wind took a breath. The man gagged and bent double. Spat out the bloody remnants of his teeth. The woman sipped, frowned at the new taste, swallowed, and shuddered. Two screams followed soon after. Not the same note, but harmonised.

“The Two-for-one,” Bazza whispered, eyes wide.

The boys erupted, slamming wings and stamping railings. “One Hundred Points!” Kenny screamed, voice cracking. “One bloody Hundred!”

I banked hard and climbed straight through their noise. Past the smell of chips and sunscreen. High up into clean air, where no sound lives. Below me Bondi churned. Lifeguards ran. Tourists hid under towels. Shit shrapnel turned the sand white.

Bondi was ours now. The humans wouldn’t forget what happened. But they would come back. They always do. But after today, they’ll watch the sky. Think twice when they see a seagull, and that’s all because of me.

1q84xhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1q84xhe/what_is_this_behavior/,What is this behavior?,"Looking for some perspective and advice from  waywards. Betrayed perspectives are welcome too.

  
Short backstory, I found out my WH was having an EA with a coworker about a month ago. We have both been in IC and MC since then. 

  
At this point my WH is still very noncommittal about wanting R. 

  
He is able to hug me and be supportive if I’m simply crying or expressing pain physically. However things break down anytime I express something verbally.

  
Example is last night he shared that part of his IC was to spend some time reflecting on what it would mean to not have me in his life anymore. A little while later I asked him how he wanted me to act right now. Should I continue to reach out, show physical affection, try and connect. He said he would take anything I’m willing to give, and asked why I asked.

  
I said it’s difficult to reach out to someone who continues to show me rejection, both from the EA and the fact that he is at the point he has to analyze his reasons for being with me.

  
He got angry and defensive, saying he can’t do anything right. That his honesty is just making everything worse and he is being punished for it.

  
He brought up that he shared AP had reached out to him over last weekend. I told him I appreciated him letting me know. But a few days later I asked him to talk to his IC about setting a boundary with AP to not contact him about anything non work related. He brought up the ‘Im punishing him’ for the truth point again. He didn’t talk about it with his IC much, so I still have no answer.

  
After our discussion last night I broke down again. Told him at this point I don’t think it’s wise for me to continue to share my emotions verbally because he can’t handle it. He started to argue but stopped. I’m not proud of myself that I keep getting triggered but I’m so confused.

  
Later on he went and took a shower. Then came to me and said he wanted to take a break from talking about the hard stuff this weekend. That we should just go get coffee and spend time together because we are disconnected. 

He has been making gestures like talking about things when I ask, getting my gifts. But I told him that all feels hollow when we are in this limbo state.

  
At this point I feel like I’m in some alternate reality. Am I seeing this wrong and I’m somehow overreacting to his behavior? Is he just so deep in his shame or some kind of identity crisis he isn’t clearly seeing how all this is affecting me? Is he just a cake eater?

  
I have been with someone with narcissistic personality disorder, and his behavior doesn’t match that. He isn’t being malicious or overtly abusive.

But this is crazy making, right? How am I supposed to ‘connect’ with someone who won’t cut off AP, won’t let me talk about my feelings without taking things personally, won’t make a decision about what he wants?

  
I feel like I need to start retreating pretty significantly at this point, for my own protection and sanity. Why am I continuing to invest in something that is hurting me so badly? Or am I just too fresh into this and I have to give things more time to settle?

hey everyone, figured i'd share a few ideas for coastal property owners who want to make some extra cash beyond just short-term renting. the location advantage is huge and a lot of people overlook the easy stuff.  
  
first, if you have extra space, you should check out prked. if you have an unused driveway, garage, or even just a spare parking spot, you can list it on there for passive income. a lot of beach towns have terrible parking and people will gladly pay for a private, guaranteed spot that's way cheaper than a public lot. people use it for cars, rvs, or even boat trailer storage, which is perfect for the coast. as a host, you set your own rates and schedule, and the setup is super easy to get some effortless earnings.  
  
for your actual house and land, there are a bunch of other options.  
  
event rentals: if you have a great view or a nice backyard space, you can rent it out for small events. think photoshoots, micro-weddings, or corporate retreats. photographers are always looking for a unique coastal backdrop and you can charge by the hour for their use.  
  
offer experiences: you don't have to run a full business. you can partner with a local tour guide or instructor and just use your property as the meeting point or staging area. think kayak rentals, stand-up paddleboard lessons, or even beach yoga classes. you take a small cut for providing the prime location.  
  
storage and rentals: coastal towns mean water sports. people need a place to rent surfboards, paddleboards, or snorkeling gear. if you have a shed or a small garage that's close to the water, you could rent that out to a local business for equipment storage, or even manage a small rental operation yourself. this ties back to the prked idea too, because you can rent out any unused storage space like a garage for people's own boats or jet skis in the off-season.  
  
mobile food or drink vending: if your property is right on a busy strip and zoning allows for it, you could rent out a portion of your driveway or lawn to a mobile food vendor, like a gourmet coffee cart or a seasonal beach bar. high foot traffic is an instant business booster.  
  
hope this helps anyone looking to get more from their beach dream house.",1,1767954644.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1q84ue0,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2026/01/09/thomas-franks-authority-at-spurs-is-being-eroded/,Thomas Frank’s authority at Spurs is being eroded before our very eyes," • It may have been a storm in a coffee cup on the south coast for Thomas Frank, but there is a very real threat to his authority brewing at Tottenham Hotspur.

• Less than 24 hours after being caught sipping from an Arsenal-branded cup during Tottenham’s stoppage-time defeat at Bournemouth, Frank had to sit in front of a red and white Emirates-branded background to answer questions about his captain Cristian Romero.

• The FA Cup backdrop provided Arsenal fans, who have flooded social media with a host of Frank-inspired jokes in response to the coffee cup storm, with another chance to poke fun at him. But there is not much for Tottenham’s head coach to smile about, as he attempts to retain some sense of control.

• That has not been helped by the decision to let off Romero without a fine after he posted a message on social media in the hours after the defeat by Bournemouth that read: “At times like this, it should be other people coming out to speak, but they don’t – as has been happening for several years now. They only show up when things are going well, to tell a few lies.”

• It was later edited to delete the accusation of “lies” and that seemed to be enough to somehow allow Romero to escape with just a chat with Frank and co-sporting director Johan Lange.

• Asked if Romero would still be captain and whether he had been fined, Frank said: “He is our captain, he’s not been fined.” Pushed on why Romero had not been punished, the Dane added: “I think there’s a lot of ways to deal with different situations. We’ve chosen to have a good conversation with him, understand where he stands, handle it internally and that’s everything I have to say.”

• The club remained silent on Romero and his outburst, leaving the door ajar to the theory that Spurs and Frank are simply too scared of the potential consequences to properly punish the fiery Argentine.

• Frank insisted he had shown he is able to draw the line with his players by dropping Yves Bissouma from his Super Cup squad for persistent lateness. But some may reach the same conclusion as one source, who spoke to Telegraph Sport, and said: “It’s double standards.”

• There have already been claims that Romero is granted more freedom around the training ground than the rest of the squad and he was made the club’s highest-paid player when he signed a new contract last summer. Vinai Venkatesham, the Tottenham chief executive, told a fans forum it was “the best deal in world football this summer” when he addressed them in October.

• Defending Romero’s ability to lead the team, Frank pointed to the fact the captain was one of the players to speak up at half-time at Bournemouth after Spurs had let an early lead slip to trail at the break.

• Telegraph Sport has been told that Tottenham’s angry players took it upon themselves to hold a half-time inquest at the Vitality Stadium. But by the time the players returned to the dressing room, having confronted fans after the final whistle, there was little said with the mood described as quiet and brooding.

• A source said: “Things were said between the players at half-time in the dressing room, but at the end it was just quiet. The message to the players was just ‘well done’, which seems a bit strange given what had happened.”

• Tottenham’s defeat at Bournemouth was greeted by loud booing from the visiting supporters. Micky van de Ven was seen gesturing to fans in a tense stand-off before being dragged away, while Pedro Porro, who was also helped out of the firing line, and João Palhinha went to speak to supporters face to face.

• Porro, along with Richarlison, posted messages of support below Romero’s social media post, and Frank revealed that he had spoken with his entire squad, as well as Romero personally, on Thursday morning to try to clear the air.

• “We spoke this morning in the meeting we had,” Frank said. “It’s a very emotional situation to be in after a late defeat. They’re human beings. They get questioned every single time. They’re footballers, that’s part of it, but that’s not the same [as saying it is] easy. I’d like to see some of the guys on social media or you guys experience that pressure out there. I don’t think it’s that easy.”

**Van de Ven ‘frustrated’**

• Tottenham have been keen to offer Van de Ven a new contract, with his current deal running to 2029. But some sources believe the defender is frustrated with the current situation at the club.

• Earlier this season, Telegraph Sportrevealed that Tottenham players discussed in detail their disconnect with the club’s fans in a team meeting and the issue is now viewed within the squad as critical.

• The subject of Spurs supporters was the key theme in a players’ meeting following the defeat by Chelsea on November 1. At the end of the game, Van de Ven and Djed Spence could not hide their displeasure with some fans and walked straight off the pitch.

• Porro also hit out at “disrespectful” fans on social media following the defeat by Fulham, in which goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario was booed by some Tottenham supporters.

• Asked why there have been so many behavioural issues, Frank said: “That’s the beauty of things happening once and then you can always go back to it. Then there are a lot of emotions in football, when it’s not going in the direction you want and you get emotional after a game or whatever. 

• Everyone reacts differently. We’re working very hard on being cool and calm, but still a passionate unit that can compete every game. And that will go a little bit up and a little bit down.”

• Tottenham are still to confirm whether co-sporting director Fabio Paratici, who has been heavily linked with Fiorentina, will stay at the club and the Italian was left off Frank’s list of staff who he stressed are working together at Spurs.

• “I think it’s very important to stress that even though there’s noise, the club is very aligned,” Frank said. “Johan, Vinai and I are very aligned. Ownership is very aligned. We know it’s a tough spell that we need to get through.”

• Frank may remain in charge of the team as head coach, but whether he is in control of his players is not quite so clear.",62,1767954554.0,coys,47,0.84,False
