1iy7dhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1iy7dhn/consistent_failure_and_lack_of_direction/,Consistent Failure and Lack of Direction,"Hi Community,

 

Throw away account for obvious reasons. I’m a 24 year old law student at a pretty prestigious law school, who has average grades (around 50^(th) percentile in my class). Unfortunately, the nature of being at a school like mine is that all of my peers are incredibly smart/successful/confident, and great at most of what they do.

 

Going through the job hunting process has been absolute hell. I went from interviewing at some of the top law firms in NY (and one of them telling me I would be getting an offer), to interviewing at top firms in my city, to interviewing at top consulting firms, to nw having pretty poor odds of getting a job for this summer, which severely limits my opportunities for getting a job when I graduate (I have 1 more year left in my program after this one). I have spent hundreds of hours networking, coffee chatting, doing mock interviews, and it has all led to me being in a position where my career now has a pretty poor outlook. I have asked all of my interviewers and peers that I work with for feedback so that I can work to improve, but on all fronts the response has been that I’m a great candidate, I just need to keep doing what I’m doing, and that there just isn’t enough jobs for all of the great applicants.

 

I’ve also never been in a relationship or had any success romantically. I continue to try to ask people out, but at every turn get rejected. Everyone I’ve asked out has told me that I’m great, but that they aren’t romantically interested in me.  I’ve tried taking periods where I do not focus on this, hoping that self-improvement and focusing on myself will lead to me being more confident. My entire life I have been hopeful that in the future things will get better, and have tried to remain optimistic, but it has become difficult recently.

 

 I am big on personal responsibility, and doing what I can to change the things within my control, but the problem is that on both fronts, I have no idea what I’m doing wrong which makes it difficult to improve. Things have not gotten better, and persistence, resilience, and perseverance (on the romantic front I’ve been trying since I was about 18, and on the job front I’ve been looking for over a year) do not seem to be paying off. Talking to my friends about this is not really helpful, because they do not have any of these problems. They all have awesome jobs, great relationships, and the only advise they are able to give me is that eventually something will work out, likely because they rarely have to deal with adversity. When I was younger I was sometimes jealous of those around me, but as I’ve grown up I no longer feel this way. I’m genuinely happy that the people around me are successful, and I want my friends to be their best selves.

 

I used to struggle a lot with my self-worth, and for a time I was able to overcome that. Recently though, with consistent rejection on both fronts, it has been difficult not to feel like there is something wrong with me. I want to fix myself, but I don’t  really know how to I’ve been in therapy for years, have tried medications (I’ve been taking ADHD meds for about a year or so, and recently started taking anti-depressants as well). My life doesn’t seem to be getting better. I feel like I keep trying the same things over and over again but for whatever reason am unable to figure out how to succeed in the things that are important to me (mainly relationships and my career).

 

I would really appreciate advice if anyone has any that they think may be helpful. Thank you so much.

Im not on the apps and prefer to cold approach but even thats sketchy. I’ve noticed a recent trend in where Im meeting potential matches. Since i dont drink, I usually dont go to many bars except once in awhile to eat alone. Most of the single women I meet I meet through work. Problem is, I work with adults and seniors with disabilities and am in a caregiver type dynamic. Obviously dating the family members of clients is prohibited, same as coworkers, vendors, associates or really anyone connected to our agency in any way.  
I have a side hustle in the summer teaching powered paragliding. I get referrals from other instructors and stuff so trying to date in that dynamic seems unprofessional as well. 
I actually sat and thought about it and Id say 80 % of the single women I meet I can’t ask out for a coffee without risk. Does anyone else work so much that it seems thats where all your prospects are?

The thing is I had the money and I wanted the cheapest option and kind of regret it. Now I changed my mind and I’ll go for the “buy one cry once”. I’ll sell the Go and get the “end game” machine.

Now I’m considering 3 options:

1.	⁠LM mini - outrageous price in my country, but a kind of dream machine. Consistent, easy to fix and has a local assistance for technical repair where I live.  220V.

2.	⁠Mozzafiato - Beautiful as hell. New model has fast heating. 110V, which is great for me but also E61 (although heats faster).

3.	⁠Bianca - Great features, beautiful. Buuut. 220V, E61, no local support, a lot of time to heat (yeah I know I can use a smart plug).

So strap yourselves in, it's going to be a long one.

In 2022, I (26 F) attended a double birthday dinner for two of my close friends. They were on the verge of dating, so they wanted to begin to integrate their friend groups, so more events of this nature could happen. It was at this party, I met the subject of my post (let's call her Judy). Upon our first meeting, I found her to be *very* attractive. Luckily for me, it was clear she felt the same, as she spent the evening asking me questions about my interests, even getting to the point of holding my hand from across the table. As we left the restaurant, she drunkenly kissed me, which I did not reciprocate because, well, she was drunk. She said that she appreciated me for not taking advantage of her, and we all headed in our respective directions. When I arrived at my destination, I was pleased to see she made it home safely as well, and she had followed me on Instagram.

I made an effort to talk to her as often as I could, and she did the same. Then about a month after our first meeting, I gathered up the courage to ask her on a date, to which she enthusiastically said yes. It was quite lovely, we spent the whole night cuddled up next to each other, talking about our lives, work drama, how we had met the two birthday boys, and the things we enjoyed doing in our spare time. I found that we had a lot in common, which meant the conversation never got old. A few days after our date, she messaged me and informed me that while she did love spending time with me, and getting to know me, she was not in the mental space for a relationship. I know a lot of people say ""oh yeah, that's fine"" and secretly not mean it, but it was *genuinely* fine with me. We agreed that we would remain friends, and that is how it was until the summer of 2023.

Judy and I had become quite close; frequently messaging each other, going on coffee dates and taking walks around the city. While a small part of me still harboured slightly romantic feelings towards her, they were so minuscule, I barely even noticed them. It was around this time, Judy had begun to get more flirty with me; being overly complimentary, talking about how we would make the ""hottest couple,"" and comparing our dynamic to Morticia and Gomez Addams. Of course, I was mildly weary, but I was quite enjoying being talked to in this manner, and egged it on with comments of my own. It all came to a head at the end of summer bonfire she was holding at her house. I arrived a bit earlier than the majority of the party, so I could assist in setting up and take some of the stress off her shoulders. Upon my arrival, Judy was *instantly* all over me; holding my hand, complimenting my outfit, carrying my bags, and more. I will spare you all the details, but this ended with her and I kissing multiple times, even at one point kissing beneath the moonlight in the lake near her house (It sounds fake, I know, for a moment I thought I was in a romance novel). Needless to say, after that night, my feelings intensified. Despite never admitting our feelings to each other, it was obvious that we both felt similarly.

This game of ""I like you, but I won't tell you, but we will flirt endlessly, and kiss whenever we're alone, and I will stare at you from across the room every single time we both inhabit the same place"" continued on, and in hindsight, while I should have been concerned, I was far too happy to care.

Before I knew it, 8 months had passed and my birthday rolled around again. I booked a hotel room for her and I after she had suggested it, smack dab in the middle of the city, ensuring the room had two beds as I didn't want to be presumptuous. Once more, I arrived early, beginning the process of doing my makeup and preparing for the night ahead. Judy arrived shortly after she finished work, informing me that she would need a shower when she got up to the room. Upon letting her in, she dropped all her bags, gave me a quick kiss on the cheek, and instantly began to strip down to nothing, while telling me about her day. I was doing my best to not look at her, as I didn't want to be disrespectful and stare, but she then asked if I ""cared to join her in the shower for a couple minutes."" In an attempt to be coy, I told her she should have let me know this was happening before I started my makeup. In response, she chuckled, winked and said ""next time, then?"" It took me a few minutes to slow my heart rate back down again, but I eventually did, and continued getting ready. It was at this point I was absolutely certain she and I were going to become something. What that would be? I wasn't sure. But I was excited to find out.

The rest of the night went off without a hitch; dinner was great, Judy met all my very close friends, and we danced the night away. I was grateful I got us two beds, as we ended up bringing one of our friends with us to the hotel, so they could sleep off the alcohol. Judy slept in the bed with them, just incase of anything, and I slept on my own (and was grateful to do so, I think I would've woken her up too many times with how much I had to get up for the bathroom and whatnot).

After the party, Judy went mildly dark on me; barely responding to messages, and when she did, they were dry. I began spiralling, wondering if I had said or done something I couldn't remember. After consulting a few of my friends, they had all agreed that I should send her one large message about how sorry I was, even if I didn't do anything wrong, and then confess my true feelings about her, to her. So, I crafted a message, and sent it.

Her response?

""You did nothing wrong honey. And thank you for telling me how you feel, but I'm sorry, I only really like you as a friend.""

A flurry of emotions came over me, with the main one being confusion: how could she have acted like this for so long, then tell me she had absolutely ZERO romantic feelings for me? It just didn't make sense. But I accepted it, told her it was okay, and that if she wanted, we would remain friends, but we would have to lay down some boundaries: no kissing, no overtly flirty compliments, and if one of us was making the other uncomfortable, we discuss it. She expressed her gratitude for my understanding, and promised to uphold all the boundaries I had laid down for us.  
But, of course, she didn't, as the next time we hung out in person, it went right back to the old dynamic: she would tell me how lucky the next person I am with is going to be, because of how much love I had to offer, then brought up how beautiful our wedding would be, and asked me what song we would have our first dance to, if given the chance. Despite feeling utterly disrespected, I felt the best way to get through this would be to simply ignore these comments, and push on with life.

It eventually worked, as the dust began to settle between Judy and I. Our conversations were shorter, but they were filled with jokes and memes we thought the other would enjoy, along with deep discussions about emotions. I confided in her that while I was very into her, I had written her a few songs and poems, as I that was the best vehicle for me to deal with my own feelings. She said she felt flattered, and was glad I had writing as an outlet, instead of keeping everything bottled up. I swore these were poems and songs I would never publish, as I believed that would be an awkward conversation for our future partners, and she agreed. Everything was peaceful, and platonic, allowing us both the space to move forward from whatever mess we had gotten ourselves into. I thought it was over.

I could not have been more wrong.

A couple weeks ago, I met up with one of our mutual friends (let's call them Daphne) for an event. Prior to our arrival at said event, we had gotten on the topic of Judy and her new partner (let's call him Isaac). We both remarked that we thought they were moving a bit too fast for 3 months, but ultimately, it was Judy's prerogative, and we would just be there for her in any way we could. I made a joke at my own expense, bringing up my past feelings for Judy, which started a new conversation, one that illuminated and confounded both Daphne and I.

As it turns out, Daphne, like the vast majority of our friend group, was unaware of the extent of mine and Judy's relationship, as Judy had neglected to mention all the overly romantic gestures she exhibited towards me, as well as stating my romantic feelings for her had ""no real basis."" To add insult to injury, and avoid any culpability, she had been telling people, including her new partner, that I was attempting to befriend for her sake, that I was ""obsessed with her,"" and used personal things I told her as the butt of many jokes. *Gut punch.* I had initially doubted this, not because I believed Daphne would lie, but more so because I needed to see the proof before I jumped to this conclusion. Thankfully, Daphne had their previous messages about me saved, so she pulled out her phone and showed me the messages they shared. A majority of them were Judy acknowledging my feelings, when I did have feelings for her, and stating that she was only still speaking to me ""because she felt bad,"" and saying she would never be interested in me in a romantic sense, but I gave her ""so much romantic attention,"" that she ""couldn't help but play into it."" *Double gut punch.* That was the final straw for me. I couldn't believe I trusted someone so deeply, telling them very personal details about my life, all the while, they felt they could use me for their own ego boost, and make me the butt of their jokes.

I took a few days to gather my thoughts, and composed a very long, very detailed message, stating what I had heard from ""unnamed sources"" and gave Judy the opportunity to explain herself. Her response? She elected to pin a majority of our issues on her new partner, stating that he was ""very insecure"" about her and I remaining friends, because *HE* thought that I was ""obsessed"" with him, and in some sort of ""competition"" with him, and continued by stating she had ""no idea"" what I was talking about, and that she has only ever spoken of me in ""positive regards."" I told her that he would not have these ideas in his head if she hadn't put them there, and that there was no ""competition"", as it is not in my character to pine after someone if they have a partner, as I know that is unrealistic, which she knew. I also confronted her on the ways she had made me feel, and how finding out this information really broke my heart and caused me to feel like I needed to keep my guard up. She apologized, which I appreciated, but simultaneously avoided any form of accountability by doing every possible thing she could to place majority of the blame on her partner. 

After a few paragraphs back and forth, I decided it was best that we keep our interactions to a minimum. Considering we are in the same friend group, and I want to keep the peace for their benefit, I stated that in social settings, we could make polite conversation, but outside of that, we would not have contact until I felt ready. I warned her, even if that day came, and I was more than ready to speak to her again, I probably would still keep it to a minimum, as I no longer trusted her. She didn't fight me on it, nor did she attempt to make it right in any way, instead, just stating that ""it was clear I had made up my mind"" and told me how much she loved me, and how much she would miss me. It hurt, it still hurts. 

Most of my friends have told me I did the right thing, but I feel those answers might be biased, considering they are *my friends,* and while I believe my friends, and feel within myself this was the best choice, I still have my doubts. So I figured I would bring it here, and ask the collective: Did I make the right choice here? Would you have done something different? Any and all answers would be welcome.

1iy77jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Immediate-Curve-5089/comments/1iy77jl/7_secrets_to_successful_offmarket_real_estate/,7 Secrets to Successful Off-Market Real Estate Deals,"Here’s a closer look at the key strategies for finding off-market real estate deals that can really make a difference in your investment journey.

**Number 1,** build strong networks. You gotta get out there and connect with real estate agents, fellow investors, and local contractors. For instance, if you grab coffee with a real estate agent you trust, they might share a lead on a property that hasn't even hit the market yet. Just remember, the more people you know, the more opportunities you’ll discover.

**Number 2,** leverage direct marketing. This means reaching out to potential sellers directly through personalized letters or postcards. Picture this: you send a heartfelt letter to a homeowner expressing your interest in their property, and they decide to sell just because they liked your approach. It sounds simple, but many homeowners appreciate the personal touch and are more likely to consider your offer.

**Number 3,** utilize online resources. Websites like [GrowthCents.com](http://GrowthCents.com) focus on off-market listings that you won’t find on traditional platforms. Plus, social media sites like Facebook Marketplace can be goldmines for hidden deals. Set alerts for keywords like ""fixer-upper"" or ""distressed property"" to catch those gems before anyone else does.

**Number 4,** dive into public records. Don’t underestimate the power of public records; they can lead you to potential deals. ##  if you check tax assessment records, you might find properties that are behind on taxes and could be motivated to sell quickly. It’s kinda like playing detective—just keep an eye out for the clues!

**Number 5,** attend real estate auctions. These events can be competitive but are fantastic for snagging properties below market value. Imagine walking into an auction knowing exactly what you're after and being fully prepared with financing; it gives you a real advantage when bidding starts.

**Number 6,** be diligent in negotiations. When talking with sellers, show some empathy—many might be dealing with personal or financial issues. For instance, if a seller is facing foreclosure, offering them a quicker closing time can ease their stress and make your offer more appealing.

**Number 7,** seek professional guidance. Align yourself with investor-friendly real estate agents who can help navigate the complexities of off-market deals. Having an experienced agent by your side can save you time and help avoid costly mistakes, especially if they know the ins and outs of local markets.

I’m in my mid twenties at this point and have never had any kind of juice, coffee, tea, soda, alcohol, etc. I can’t even drink a glass of water if there’s a lemon wedge on the rim, and I often can’t drink water if it came out of the same tap as another drink (like at a soda fountain). If I try to drink something other than water (which I have seldom tried), it can’t make it past my gag reflex.

Of course, unlike ARFID with food, my flavored drink aversion isn’t usually a problem. In fact, some people assume it’s a weird health choice. It does make social situations awkward at times and prevents me from doing things like going to bars (because I can’t trust that the water there didn’t come out of the same tap as the beer or another drink). And it sometimes raises questions on religious holidays (I’m Jewish and wine occurs in many of our rituals and people find it weird when I refuse both wine and all the non-alcoholic alternatives). I’ve also on a couple of occasions declined medical treatments or tests that involved flavored liquids. But other than that, I rarely have a problem just drinking water. 

I’m autistic and have other sensory issues and I generally attribute my flavored drink aversion to that. Still, while I’ve met plenty of other autistic people, I’ve literally never met another person with a drink aversion as extreme as mine.

**Together.ai: Democratizing AI Access**

Not to be overshadowed, Together.ai collected $305 million to fuel its mission to democratize AI. Their focus? Making open-source AI tools as common as cat memes on the internet. Backed by everyone from Salesforce Ventures to former Cisco CEO John Chambers, Together.ai’s approach looks to blend commerce and community seamlessly.

While Palmer Luckey’s AI startup dreams were still just a sparkling notion, former DeepMind scientist Simon Kohl had already founded Latent Labs with $50 million in funding, all to turn biology into a programmable wonderland using generative AI. Imagine designing proteins like you’re customizing your morning coffee—extra shot of taurine, please.

Clearly, AI is tossing around cash as if it's creating a new season of ""Startups Gone Wild."" Yet, with such hefty investments comes high expectations. The question remains: will these startups deliver on their sky-high promises, or will we see another crash and burn on Silicon Valley's infamous startup freeway? 🤔

\- It's a lot of money up front. Do you take it in full, or do they have the option of a payment plan/automatic billing each month with a credit card/bank account on file? Especially for someone new signing up with you, how can they trust you enough to go through with it initially? What do you have in place as a backup in terms of refunds, contracts, legally enforceable things?

\- What are your ""credentials"" that convince them go through with it and trust to sign up for a semester at a time with you?

\- I've had trouble with people even committing to just a few months at time. I recently tried to put 9 months minimum in my policies if you sign up to take lessons with me but the main issue is the first person to see that said they don't want to commit if they have never had one lesson from you before, or know how your teaching is / if you're a good fit for them. That's the main concern for me. Do you give a free trial lesson if you charge for a semester at a time? How do you personally get around that?

\- How do you legitimize the cost and structure of a semester at a time to potential students/parents, when they could easily go to a teacher that would charge less/only charge by the month? What do you have, or what do you do to convert them/ win them over?

A Day of Dates,"My best friend just got engaged and I wanted to give her something to celebrate, this is what I came up with! I went out of budget... but it's my BEST friend, how could I hold back on celebrating this milestone for her!?

The idea behind it is that the gift provides a day's worth of quality time with your new fiance, covering breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert.

For breakfast: a local bag of freshly roasted coffee beans with a label personalized to the couple, so they can enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning together. Tiny Arms is a small business and the beans are AMAZING, so I ordered from there.

For lunch: a picnic basket with a pink and red floral bandana, as well as a champagne dog toy and a carrot rabbit toy (get it... like carats in a diamond?), for a family picnic in the yard with the pets (they've got a dog and rabbit).

For dinner: the Table for Two cookbook, some red taper candles, and two custom embroidered cloth napkins with an excerpt of a poem by my best friend's favorite poet in her fiance's handwriting. the poem excerpt is about having a strong foundation in your marriage and being able to stand the test of time.

For dessert: an intimate gift... a bar of edible (marijuana) chocolate, a scentless massage oil candle (she has sensitive skin), Le Papier d'Armenie incense papers to bring fragrance back into play, lubricant, and a white lingerie teddy.

And then a few extra's to celebrate the big news! I tried to avoid typical bridal gifts as she is not a fan of those. For small things: a bouquet sticker, a patch of the flag of the country they got engaged in, a locket sticker with their initials, cupid stickers, matching otter pins (they mate for life), red heart-shaped carabiner clips (they're very outdoorsy). For more useful gifts: a red velvet travel jewelry case and jewelry cleaner.

She lives far away, so I will be mailing this as a package and I want to make it a luxurious experience to open it (VERY open to suggestions on additional ways to do so)! I plan to put the small items and the intimate items in white mesh drawstring gift bags, and I bought cute pink wrapping paper with sweet red illustrations for the rest of the items. Everything will be placed inside the picnic basket, and then I will wrap a bow around the basket with crocheted white ribbon. The picnic basket will be placed inside a box, surrounded by red crinkle paper to keep it secure. The box will be taped up with this tape to add a fun visual element. When you open the picnic basket, on the top will be two personal cards (one for best friend and one for fiance) as well as a third card explaining the day of dates via a short poem. There will also be a card including the full poem referenced on the embroidered dinner napkins.

That's all she wrote!! Let me know what you think and if you have any more suggestions! Thank you for reading and indulging me, I was so excited I had to share!",1,1740520483.0,Gifts,0,1.0,False
1iy6yxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PunkCapitalist/comments/1iy6yxq/hot_take_every_dollar_you_earn_is_lifechanging/,"Hot take: Every dollar you earn is ""life-changing money""","So I was listening to some podcast where this startup wonderkid (to be) was talking about how his goal was to make ""life-changing money"" – by which he meant a $20 million exit. His actual answer to an open ended question.

I couldn't help but think...what a load of crap! Like who thinks this is the most likely expected outcome? I get setting aspirational goals, but there's a spectrum along the way. There's a reason for the term ""ramen profitable.""

Every single dollar is life-changing by definition. That's literally what money does – it changes your ability to navigate life.

One dollar might not seem like much, but it's leverage. It's a tool. It's potential energy.

$1 = a hot cup of coffee that keeps you going when you're exhausted

$10 = a meal when you're hungry

$100 = groceries for the week

$1,000 = rent or car repairs that keep you mobile

$10,000 = freedom from immediate financial stress for a few months

$100,000 = maybe a house down payment or debt elimination

See what I mean? Each level changes your life in meaningful ways. The difference between $0 and $1,000 in your bank account is MASSIVE. The difference between $1 million and $20 million? Much less significant in terms of actual life quality.

I've been building small businesses for years now, and I've noticed something: the entrepreneurs who focus on making their first $500/month consistently are WAY more likely to succeed than those chasing millions from the start.

Why? I believe it's because they're solving real problems for real people who are willing to pay real money RIGHT NOW. Not some theoretical future customer base that might exist after you burn through investor cash.

Look, I'm not saying don't dream big. I'm saying we should nornalize that every dollar is already a win, already meaningful, already life-changing.

The first dollar you earn from a customer is the hardest and most significant. I've never framed a dollar physically, but I've always had them framed in my memories.

It means:
- Someone values what you do
- You're solving a real problem
- You have a business, not just an idea

I built my first profitable business aiming for $100/day. (Didn't make it, but still kept it reasonable.) Not $100k/day. Just enough to pay rent and eat without having a boss. And it changed my life more profoundly than any amount of money has since. (It was an ebay business selling copies of Oracle Database 10g on CDs I'd burned because a lot of people didn't have the bandwidth to pull down the file over the internet back then. Simple enough.)

So my advice is if you're just starting out – celebrate every dollar. It's already life-changing money. The rest is just a matter of scale. (And there's a lot more to love about business than just the dollar, so factor that in, too.)

1iy6yxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nychousinglottery/comments/1iy6yxh/studio_vs_1_bedroom/,Studio vs 1 Bedroom,"Hi there!

Recently lucked out by snagging a studio apartment through the housing lottery at a gorgeous luxury complex in DTBK.

Applied over 2 years ago, and have since moved to a 1 bedroom in South Slope/Windsor Terrace area. My current apt is a great price, rent stabilized, and very large (true 1 bedroom, with separate kitchen, living space, and office space). It is on the top floor of a 4th floor walk-up, but I haven't really minded that! My only gripe about my current place is that I get lots of leaks being on the top floor of a flat roof building, and my landlord is pretty unresponsive/useless.

So, totally forgot about this lottery entry and was surprised when I got an offer. The only catch is that this place is a studio (525 sq ft to be exact). Significantly smaller from my current place, only $50 cheaper, but it's a luxury complex (doorman, maintenance onsite, central A/C, washer/dryer in unit, coworking spaces/library, bar/coffee shop, rooftop, and gym/pool for an additional price).

I know I'm so lucky to win a unit through the housing lottery, but I just can't decide if it's worth downgrading space. I've lived in tiny NYC apartments (that were NOT luxury buildings) with roommates, so I know I can do it. I'm also 29 y.o. and there's not much going on in South Slope. It's quiet & residential, but a little far from friends. The trains aren't convenient, and my commute to work is 45mins-hour one way. In this new place, I would be next to Dekalb Market, Trader Joes, great shopping/movie theater. And not to mention steps from any train line in the city. My commute to work would only be 20 mins (granted I only go in 2 days a week... for now).

I scheduled a tour on Friday, so I'm sure that seeing the place in person will be the decision maker. But would love some advice - esp. from folks who live in Studios (or anyone who has downgraded from a 1 bed to a studio)",1,1740520375.0,nychousinglottery,1,1.0,False

So the other day I was in my room that I share with my 4 year old sister but she was at the park in are apartment complex with my 12 and 10 year older brother about 30 feet from are apt, so I have a cd player in my room but I dont use it before 8 and after 8pm to not bother are neighbors so during early or late hours I use my head phones and listen to music so that what I was doing this day even though it was 2pm with my door closed and you could not hear my music unless you came in my room.

Well about 2-3 days ago I was doing this playing or nah with the weekend in it and cleaning my vanty when my mom's bf Henry walked in hw asked me to show him where the coffee mugs wjere because he could not find in I showed him where they would be and said there probably in the dish washer than went back to my room 

Well about 20-30 miuntes later my mom texts me saying could I keep my music down because Henry said he could hear it from the balcony on the other side of the apt and that he said whatever I was listening to was inappropriate and she asked what I was listening to and i telling her to she said okay and asked next time if I can use my headphones I tell her I was and they where on full volume and she said okay. 

So I get over it well yesterday I was listening to music without my headphones this time while putting my clothes away this time my mom was home and in her room Henry comes in to ask me smth and my music is playing he asked why can't I put headphones in and I told him they where charging he told me to turn it off than and I refused and he got mad over it.

- Shiseido Urban Environment sunscreen: loved it, prefer my La Roche Posay Anthelios for the price though. WRP
- NYX Proof It waterproof eye primer: It definitely locked things down, but even with double cleansing it was hard to remove and emphasized eye lines. Discontinued anyway but WNRP.
- NYX No Filter blurring primer: I really enjoyed this but it had definitely gone off and had that oxidized oil smell. I like that it had a slight tint so I could wear it alone on no-to-low makeup days. WRP a similar product.
- Charlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin foundation in No. 2 Warm: This didn’t cause any eczema flares for me which is great! Even though I am neutral to cool, this shade worked well to give me the *slightest* bit of tan/warmth while still matching my face because it is on the sheer side unless you overdo it. This did tend to emphasize dryness, so I had to make sure my skin was exfoliated and well moisturized before use. It also didn’t last for ~12 hours; I’d say wear started to be noticeable around 6-7 hours and it was pretty much gone entirely by 12. 

Accidental Pans:
- Origins Ginzing brightening serum: this smelled good but it irritated my skin and made it photosensitive even with sunscreen on top. I also didn’t notice any brightening effect. WNRP
- Up & Up makeup remover towelettes: These are fine in a pinch but they don’t remove heavy eye makeup and they can dry my skin out and the texture is a little rough and irritating. WNRP
- Paula’s Choice Enriched Calming Toner: I already have a new bottle of this. I don’t find that it calms existing redness, but it does prevent *new* redness at the end of the day. 
- Urban Decay All Nighter setting spray: I used this for wetting my brush to do more intense eye looks. I already RP a new bottle of the vitamin C version. I found this one drying.
- 2 glosses, 1 Buxom in Mudslide and 1 Flormar in ??? (sticker is gone). 

Made Progress:
- Tower 28 BeachPlease blush in Office Hour: I finally learned how to use this on fair skin but I still don’t like it. It’s too stiff and pigmented and doesn’t blend well for me unless I use my fingers and I don’t like to do that. I made a dent in it though and used it nearly every day, so it’s resting for now!
- Elizabeth & James Nirvana Amethyst: I fell back into love with this fragrance and used up around 15-20% of the bottle total. It’s now getting too warm out to enjoy this wintry/fall fragrance so it’s taking a break next month!
- I vastly enlarged the pan on my Colourpop Hear Me Out and Glass Bull and Makeup Geek Buffed single shadows. Hear Me Out ended up being a perfect powder to touch up any redness if I didn’t want to wear full makeup! 
- I made a small dent on my Dust & Cream bronzer I use as a highlighter. I love this product and won’t mind if it takes a year to use up! 
- Kosas brown gel now has a lot less product in the tube. Still another 1-2 months to go.
- NYX brow pencil: I used up maybe 20-25% looking at the old photo. Considering going brunette so I want to use up auburn brow products soon. 

Moved out/Decluttered:
- Fresh lip balm in Sunset Rose: I just wasn’t feeling this warm brick color right now, and I really like the product so I don’t want to use it just to use it. 
- Vitamin C eye cream: This might’ve caused some eye irritation as it was the only thing I used on that area. It was nearly done by that time so I just cleaned out the jar to recycle.
- Urban Decay eyeliner in Alkaline: This shit is just too soft to sharpen without clogging my sharpener or losing tons of product. I switched to a twist up liner from Colourpop for now. 

March Basket: I got some new items with gift cards from my husband for VDay, so I’ve included those with some old things :)
- Natasha Denona Love Glow cheek palette (new)

My last 2 reviews have said I'm not easy to work with , which to me means I'm difficult.  Last time my mentor said he didn't experience it but it was because I couldn't do what some mates asked me to. I was on transitional duty and on weight restrictions.  


This time my new mentor said the same thing.  I asked why and she said because I didn't include someone in a conversation.  She said she'd get back to me with more examples later. She said she disagreed during the meeting but was overruled. 

I didn't get my raise regardless. Which I expected,  my dad had a heart attack and lives 200 miles away and I had bronchitis 2 different occasions. So my attendance was an issue. I'll admit that.  

I greet my coworkers.  I talk to them. I don't hang out with people outside of work, but I'm professional.  I don't have personal conversations with people I don't like,  but I talk about work related topics and answer questions.  I have maybe 4 actual friends at work but I'm nice to people 


I'm just confused.  



The ONLY thing I can think of,  is I like to bake but when I bring stuff in it's pre bagged and I only share  with people I like.  But people buy each other coffee so what's the difference? ",3,1740519864.0,tjcrew,1,1.0,False

I (26 f) recently matched with R (30 m) on Facebook dating. We seemed to hit it off at first, having similar interests. But as we arranged to meet in person for the first time is when I started to get a bad vibe from him. He was insistent on meeting at a coffee shop that was across the street from his apartment, despite my offering suggestions that were an equal distance between both of our locations. I had made it perfectly clear at the beginning that I was not wanting to rush into anything and wanted to take this first meeting as an opportunity to get to know each other better. 

A couple of days before we were supposed to meet up I had face timed him, we had talked on the phone a few times before and everything seemed fine. This call was going alright, until he kept asking me to come to his place after work that night which raised a red flag for me. I again stressed my boundaries about not wanting to rush into anything and he said that he understood. 

The day I was supposed to meet up with him, I woke up with a stomach bug and ended up canceling. I am the kind of person who believes in signs and omens. So, I took this as my bodies way of telling me to not meet up with this man and I have ceased all communication.

1iy6qi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Patagonia/comments/1iy6qi3/a_medium_budget_carretera_australroute_40_option/,"A ""Medium Budget"" Carretera Austral/Route 40 Option","**Summary**

I just wrapped up 6 weeks of travel throughout Patagonia with a car. We struggled a bit to plan this trip on a budget but I think we found a sweet spot in value/experience/cost. So much so that I wanted to write it up in case others liked a similar idea. My wife and I are traveling through South America with a minimal trekking setup (sleeping bag/pad and tent) however we were interested in doing the Ruta 40 -> Carretera Austral as a road trip and were exploring camper vans to rent. Unfortunately, even the cheapest campers available were $150-$200 per day and would really be stretching our budget. We considered getting a standard car rental and tent camping each night but the idea of pitching a tent every night with a lot of rainy nights did not sound super appealing. 

The compromise; we ended up renting a mid-sized SUV and outfitting it with a mattress, food storage containers, and car camping gear all obtained from the Easy/Jumbo stores in Puerto Montt. For us, it was way more comfortable than camping in a tent each night, the fuel mileage was fantastic, and we were able to cook with two burners comfortably. Here's how to do it:

 **Car Rental**

We rented a two wheel drive mid-sized diesel SUV from Econorent using a travel credit card with insurance coverage. With Econorent, we ended up getting a $55/day rate which was stellar. We had read some complaints about the daily rate going up substantially after including the extra insurance coverage through Econorent but with our credit card we just waived it. Not a necessity (but a huge plus for us) is that we actually got to rent the car using credit card points through Chase. It seems like they are a large enough business that other credit card companies might also use them for award travel. Either way, try to get a diesel car, the mileage is way better, the gas is generally cheaper than petrol along the road trip, and the range is great, allowing you to pick and choose a bit where to fill up. We got a Peugeot 3008 and I thought it was perfect for our use.The only hiccup for us was that Econorent offices have strict hours (closed on Sundays). Our bus was late and we lost two days waiting for the office to reopen to pick up the car. For us, it was totally worth the inconvenience but I would recommend planning closely around the Econorent office hours! Finally, if you are going to Argentina you will need to tell them 7 days before so they can arrange the permit.

**Outfit the Car**

Now you have the car, ideally you should pick it up first thing in the morning so you have all day to outfit it. Drive to the Easy in Puerto Montt: https://maps.app.goo.gl/4wAsm6EDdPkC4ZPp8. Note, you will have to pay for parking but its really cheap, like $2 for multiple hours. Easy feels like a cross between the US Target and Home Depot stores. Here, you can buy the following

**Easy**

4 plastic containers designed to slide under beds

1 small plastic container for kitchen utensils

1 1.5pax mattress (it fit perfectly into the back of the Peugeot 3008 and only cost $80)

1 bedsheet set2 shower curtains1-2 camp stoves (\~$25 each)

camping fuel (1 can per week per stove)

2 camping chairs

2 pillows

Bring these to the car and place two containers pointing out of the trunk and one container on each side pointing out of the passenger doors. Fill in the gaps with the stoves, any random gear you have. Then put the mattress on top. Finally, use the two shower curtains to protect the mattress. Then store all your clothes and backpack on top of the mattress. Now, its time to stock up on food and kitchen supplies. Here was our jumbo shopping list

**Jumbo**

2x travel mugs

2x knivescutting board set

French press (for coffee drinkers)

Car chargerSponges

Dish soap

Dish towel

Beach towel

Can opener

Tuperware style containers 

As much food as we could stock up on and gross the border with (its was cheaper than groceries in Argentina)

Bring these back and fill all those plastic bins with supplies and food. 

**Cost To Stock Up**

The total price at Easy/Jumbo for us ended up being $435 including a bunch of food for the first few days of our trip. We were traveling for 6 weeks so it was entirely worth it. Shorter trips will need to do some cost comparison. One other note, if we stocked up in Argentina, the price would have been 2-3x for the exact same equipment. 

**Conclusion**

Obviously this is not as convenient as renting a built out van. We still had to cook in the rain although we could generally find shelter to cook under in those situations. We also needed to spend about 5 minutes transforming the car into ""sleep mode"" each night and undoing it in the morning. This involves moving the seats forward and transferring your backpack from the back mattress to the front seat. Then folding up the shower curtains. Also, the mattress was pretty small (although larger than a backpacking tent setup) and getting in and out of the car was a bit awkward (although getting out of a backpacking tent isn't particularly easy either). Overall, it was extremely nice to sleep in the car when it rained, avoid daily tent pitching, and enjoy some soundproofing when we had to camp near a road with higher noise. Also, we got to drive a high clearance car with great fuel economy for a way cheaper daily rate. Finally, we felt that this option was better than staying at hotels and hostels each night not only for the cost savings but also because of the truly incredible wilderness camping we got to enjoy with this setup.

1iy6p4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iy6p4v/do_they_ever_change/,Do they ever change ?,"I 27F have been dating my BF 26M for almost 5 years. I have another post that talks about the dynamic of the relationship.

However over the course of the 5 years when ever he is upset, or feels I am disrespecting him, or even when I to communicate calmly it always explodes to violence on his part.

We recently broken up for a month, he left when I wasn’t home, anyways after couple weeks he came back. He spoke to me cried told me he didn’t know how much he loved me until he left, he knows there’s things he done to hurt me physically and mentally he promised he would “love me properly” this time. More is explained in above said post.

Anyways months or so has past, he was super loving at first, but then I felt he went back to his old ways.

At first it was shouting and billeting me to which I was stunned inside but didn’t let him see me cry.

He hit me in the face the other day my lip buss open.

Anyways yesterday(explained more in said post) he got upset when we was out playing Ludo with friends because I questioned where he was on the board.

Anyways he never showed me this “upset” until we got home, where he said he’s leaving me I just keep disrespecting him?

I kept saying sorry I was just playing a game, I didn’t mean anything by it. Anyways he got violent again, hitting slapping, (trying to punch me, I always protect my head) pulling my hair dragging me around the floor, continuing to express how it not a game what I done was disrespectful and I’ll never learn so he’s done, once he was finally done he told me he’s going back on his game party chat and if I make a single sound I won’t be sleeping here tonight. 

I didn’t speak to him again the whole night and eventually went to bed.

I woke up for work today (I WFH) and he didn’t have work today, he woke about 4 pm, got up went to the kitchen made himself cereal and coffee and ate in the room I was in, he never said a single thing to me. 

I finished at 5 pm and went into the bedroom, I’ve been in here ever since and he hasn’t come or said a word to me at all.

I’m more mad at myself tbh for believing he would change, the sincerity I saw from him it was hard not to believe him.

He hasn’t stuck to his promises and I am feeling so fucking lonely. My friends and family live over 1 hour away, is it just too far gone at this point. Is it just me or is he always going to be like this with any woman?

P.S. Do not use castor oil patches during your period as it will make you bleed more. However, you can drink matcha during your period and it will make it less painful as matcha somehow relaxes muscles in the uterus.

Try your best to switch to vegan food, avoid food with hormones for at least 6 months, eat lots of veggies and fruits, and walk for at least 30 minutes daily (the more you can exercise the better).

I tried to charge it but it went up to 15% before it switched off. The apple logo kept coming on, then dark, then the battery logo then dark and on a loop for about 1h before going dark completely.

I am not gonna lie, I had a bit of a struggle going to sleep and did not fall asleep until around 3am as I usually scroll on TikTok until I pretty much fall asleep.

I ended up waking up around 9:30am (I have a wrist watch) I couldn't go back to sleep so I ended up going to my little town that I live in, to a phone repair shop. After a few hours I got an update that it should be ready to be picked up tomorrow and they were able to change the battery and waiting for my screen to be changed which they ordered.

I spent the day walking around, bought a new book, read the book for a bit, got a coffee, cycled around, and when I was home, cleaned, applied to the most jobs in a day that I have in the last month (I am in between jobs but working part time at a bar and had day off) speaking off, had to go to my bar to check my shift tomorrow, as I was given an extra shift, I did not remember the time I start and cant check without my phone so I just walked over to check with the manager.

It is weird, I dont really miss my phone at the moment, and have been using my laptop a little more to put on a video on while I am getting ready, but apart from that, I feel weirdly energetic despite not having much sleep, and feel like Ive done so much today, even did most of my self care and am even thinking of taking a shower this evening, as I feel like I have free time.. and will help when I wake up tomorrow, hopefully will not oversleep haha

I am usually scrolling on my phone for hours on end and maybe this whole thing happening is a good thing. Despite none of my friends know that I dont have a phone, it is really chill.

As I am getting my phone back tomorrow (if I get up that is and can go before I start my shift) I will try and be more mindful with how much time I spend on it in the future and try and do 'no phone time'.

I know this is more of me getting this day off my chest, but I do think we as humanity have been brainwashed into being glued to our phones thinking we are being productive or living through the screen. We are not.

1iy6jkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1iy6jkf/the_silent_fleet/,The Silent Fleet,"Chapter 1: The Signal

Something was wrong with the shadows.

Aiko Nakamura stared at the darkened corners of the bridge, eyes narrowed against the pulsing crimson of the emergency lights. She could have sworn the darkness moved, breathing like a living thing. She rubbed her eyes, blaming exhaustion and too many consecutive shifts.

""Captain?""

Riley's voice snapped her back to reality. The young communications officer was leaning forward in his chair, headset pressed tight against one ear.

""I'm picking up something strange,"" he said, fingers dancing across his console. ""It's... faint. But it's definitely there.""

Aiko abandoned her post and moved to stand behind him. The Vanguard had been drifting through this sector for three weeks, scanning for salvage opportunities. Three weeks of empty space and mounting tension as their fuel reserves dwindled.

""What kind of signal?"" she asked, resting a hand on the back of Riley's chair.

""Distress beacon. Old format, but I recognize the pattern."" He swiveled to face her, eyes wide with excitement. ""It's colonial fleet standard. Pre-Expansion Era.""

That got her attention. ""How old are we talking?""

""At least a decade."" Riley turned back to his console, adjusting parameters. ""Maybe older.""

A decade. Aiko felt her pulse quicken. Pre-Expansion salvage was rare, valuable. The kind of score that could set them up for years. The kind that made legends in the salvage community.

""Can you clean it up? Give me something to work with?""

Riley nodded, already attacking his keyboard with renewed energy. The bridge fell silent except for the clicking of keys and the low hum of the ship's systems. Aiko glanced around at the rest of the crew, seeing the same cautious hope reflected in their tired faces.

Dom, her first officer and oldest friend, caught her eye from the navigation console. His expression was skeptical. He'd been in the salvage game long enough to know that the best finds usually came with the worst complications.

""Got it,"" Riley announced. ""Patching it through.""

The bridge speakers crackled to life, filling the space with static and distortion. Then, beneath the noise, a voice emerged—fractured and distant, like someone calling from the bottom of a well.

""—*require immediate assistance. All systems failing. Unknown contagion spreading through—*"" The voice dissolved into unintelligible static before returning. ""*—Eidolon's Mercy to any receiving vessels. Mandatory quarantine protocols—*""

The message cycled back to the beginning, repeating the same fragmented pleas.

""Eidolon's Mercy,"" Dom said, his deep voice cutting through the static. ""Why do I know that name?""

Eliza, their resident historian and data analyst, was already pulling up records on her screen. Her fingers left smudges on the display as she scrolled through file after file.

""Here,"" she said finally. ""Colony ship. Part of the Frontier Initiative. Disappeared without a trace about twelve years ago. Along with its entire escort fleet.""

""An entire fleet?"" Aiko moved to Eliza's station, studying the images on screen. The Eidolon's Mercy was massive, a floating city designed to transport thousands of colonists to the outer systems. ""What happened to them?""

Eliza shrugged. ""No one knows. They were headed for the Cygnus Reach, planning to establish a mining colony. Official records say they likely suffered catastrophic engine failure and drifted off course.""

""And now we're picking up their distress call. Twelve years later."" Dom's skepticism was evident in every syllable.

Aiko traced the outline of the colony ship on Eliza's screen. ""Can we pinpoint the signal's origin?""

Riley was already working on it. ""It's coming from somewhere inside the Vermillion Nebula. Maybe three days' burn at half-power.""

The Vermillion Nebula. A vast cloud of crimson gas and cosmic dust that had remained largely unexplored due to severe navigational hazards. The perfect place for a missing fleet to stay hidden for over a decade.

""Plot a course,"" Aiko said after a moment's consideration.

Dom raised an eyebrow. ""Just like that? We're heading toward an ancient distress call from a ship that vanished with its entire fleet?""

""You got something better to do?"" she countered. ""Our supplies are running low, and we haven't found decent salvage in months. A colonial fleet? That's the kind of score we've been waiting for.""

""If they're even there,"" Dom muttered. ""And if they are, what do you think we're going to find after twelve years? Ghost ships. Empty hulks.""

""Even better."" Aiko grinned. ""No survivors means no one to argue about salvage rights.""

Riley cleared his throat. ""Uh, about that message... The part about a contagion? And quarantine protocols? Doesn't that seem, I don't know, worth discussing?""

Aiko waved a dismissive hand. ""After twelve years? Whatever was on those ships is long dead."" She turned to address the entire bridge crew. ""This could be the payday we've been dreaming about. Colonial tech. Military-grade systems. Maybe even preserved cargo.""

She could see the calculations running behind their eyes, the mental tallying of potential profit. Even Dom couldn't argue with the numbers.

""Three days,"" she continued. ""We check it out. If it looks too dangerous, we back off. Simple recon mission.""

Dom sighed, recognizing defeat. ""I'll plot the course. But I want it on record that I think this is a terrible idea.""

""Noted,"" Aiko said, returning to her captain's chair. ""Riley, keep monitoring that signal. I want to know if anything changes. Eliza, dig up everything you can on the Eidolon's Mercy and its escort fleet. Dom, I want a full systems check before we hit the nebula. If there are navigational hazards, I want to know about them.""

As the crew dispersed to their tasks, Aiko leaned back in her chair, eyes drifting to the main viewport. Stars stretched out before them, cold and distant. Somewhere among them waited the answer to a twelve-year-old mystery.

And hopefully, a fortune in salvage.

In the ship's mess hall, the mood was electric. Word of the distress signal had spread quickly through the Vanguard's small crew, and now ten of them crowded around the largest table, debating possibilities and potential payouts.

Aiko nursed a cup of synthetic coffee, the bitter liquid long since gone cold. She watched her crew argue, letting the conversation flow without her input. They needed this—the release of tension, the spark of hope after weeks of disappointment.

""Colonial tech still fetches premium rates on the frontier markets,"" Maddox, their chief engineer, was saying. His dark hair was streaked with engine grease, hands permanently stained with mechanical fluids. ""Especially medical equipment. That stuff's worth its weight in platinum.""

""Forget the equipment,"" countered Javier, one of the younger salvage specialists. ""It's the data cores we should be after. Proprietary colonial algorithms, exploration records, resource surveys—the Frontier Initiative had the best of everything.""

""None of that matters if the ships are wrecked,"" Dom pointed out, ever the voice of caution. ""Twelve years is a long time for systems to degrade, especially if they've been floating unattended in a nebula.""

Maddox scoffed. ""You underestimate those old colony ships. They were built to last centuries, not decades. Triple redundancies on all critical systems. Self-sustaining power cores that could run for fifty years without maintenance.""

""And what about the 'unknown contagion' mentioned in the distress call?"" This came from Wei, their medical officer. Unlike the others, he seemed more concerned than excited. ""We should consider quarantine procedures of our own before boarding any of those vessels.""

An uncomfortable silence fell over the table. No one wanted to think about the potential risks when the potential rewards were so tantalizing.

Aiko set down her cup. ""Wei's right. We do this by the book. Full hazard protocols. No exceptions.""

""So we are definitely going, then?"" Riley asked, looking around the table.

""We're definitely going,"" Aiko confirmed. ""But Dom's also right—we need to be prepared for anything. Those ships could be intact, or they could be scattered debris. Either way, I want us ready.""

""What about the escort vessels?"" Eliza asked. She had her tablet open, displaying schematics of various military ships from the era. ""Standard colonial fleet formation would have included at least three destroyer-class ships, maybe more.""

Javier whistled. ""Military vessels? Now we're talking. Weapons systems alone would set us up for life.""

""If they're intact,"" Dom reminded him.

""And if no one else has found them first,"" added Maddox.

Aiko watched the conversation devolve into speculation and wishful thinking. She caught Dom's eye across the table and recognized the concern there. He'd been with her longer than anyone else on the crew, had seen more close calls and disasters than the rest combined.

Later, when the others had dispersed, he lingered in the mess hall with her.

""You really think this is worth the risk?"" he asked quietly.

Aiko stared into her empty cup. ""I think we're running out of options. Fuel reserves are at thirty percent, credit account is nearly empty, and we haven't found decent salvage in almost six months."" She looked up at him. ""We need this, Dom.""

He sighed, running a hand over his closely cropped hair. ""I know. I just... I can't shake this feeling. Something about this doesn't add up. An entire fleet disappears without a trace, and twelve years later, we just happen to pick up their distress call?""

""Space is big. Signals get lost, bounced around. Maybe it's been broadcasting all this time, and we're the first to pass close enough to hear it."" She shrugged. ""Or maybe we're just lucky.""

""When have we ever been lucky?"" Dom asked with a wry smile.

Aiko chuckled. ""There's a first time for everything.""

The ship's intercom crackled to life. ""*Captain to the bridge,*"" came Riley's voice, tight with excitement. ""*I've got something you need to see.*""

Exchanging glances, Aiko and Dom made their way back to the bridge. They found Riley hunched over his console, Eliza peering over his shoulder.

""What have you got?"" Aiko asked.

Riley looked up, eyes bright. ""I've been analyzing the signal pattern, trying to clean up more of the message. But then I noticed something strange."" He tapped a few keys, bringing up a visual representation of the signal on the main screen. ""See this modulation here? It's not random interference. It's a data packet embedded in the distress beacon.""

""What kind of data?"" Dom asked, leaning in for a closer look.

""Coordinates,"" Riley said. ""Precise coordinates. And..."" He hesitated.

""And what?"" Aiko prompted.

""And a manifest. A full accounting of every ship in the fleet, their cargo, and their last known status before communications went dark."" Riley swallowed hard. ""Captain, according to this, the Eidolon's Mercy was carrying experimental terraforming equipment. Stuff that would be worth—""

""A fortune,"" Aiko finished for him. ""Even after twelve years.""

The bridge fell silent as the implications sank in. Experimental tech from the Pre-Expansion Era was more than just valuable—it was priceless. The kind of find that changed lives.

""There's more,"" Eliza said quietly. ""I've been cross-referencing the manifest with historical records. The Eidolon's Mercy wasn't just any colony ship. It was funded directly by the Hegemony's Advanced Sciences Division.""

""Military research,"" Dom translated, expression darkening.

""Not necessarily,"" Eliza countered. ""The ASD funded civilian projects too, especially in the early days of the Expansion. But their involvement meant unlimited resources, cutting-edge technology.""

""And complete secrecy,"" Dom added. ""Which might explain why the official records about the fleet's disappearance are so sparse.""

Aiko studied the data streaming across the main screen. The coordinates placed the fleet deep within the Vermillion Nebula, in a region particularly dense with cosmic dust and ionized gas. Perfect for hiding something you didn't want found.

""How reliable are these coordinates?"" she asked.

Riley shrugged. ""They're embedded in the original signal. If the distress beacon is legitimate, then so are they.""

""That's a big 'if,'"" Dom muttered.

Aiko straightened, decision made. ""Adjust our course to the exact coordinates. Maximum safe speed.""

""Captain,"" Dom began, a warning in his voice.

""I know the risks,"" she cut him off. ""But this isn't just salvage anymore. This is history. Mystery. If the Hegemony lost a fleet of experimental ships and then covered it up, there's more going on here than a simple navigational accident.""

""All the more reason to stay away,"" Dom argued.

""Or all the more reason to be the ones who find the truth,"" Aiko countered. ""Along with the biggest salvage score of our careers.""

Dom recognized the look in her eyes—the same determination that had pulled them through countless tight spots over the years. He sighed in resignation.

""I'll update the course,"" he said. ""But we're going in weapons hot. Whatever's waiting for us in that nebula, I want us ready for it.""

Aiko nodded. ""Agreed. Full battle stations once we reach the coordinates."" She turned to Riley. ""Keep working on that signal. I want to know everything it can tell us.""

As the crew returned to their stations, Aiko remained standing, gaze fixed on the swirling crimson nebula now visible in the distance. Something had happened to the Eidolon's Mercy and its escort fleet. Something the Hegemony had tried to erase from history.

In three days, they'd find out what.

The Vermillion Nebula loomed before them, a vast cloud of crimson gas and cosmic dust that stretched across the viewport like a bloodstain on the void. The Vanguard approached cautiously, sensors straining to penetrate the dense particulate matter that gave the nebula its name and fearsome reputation.

Aiko stood on the bridge, arms crossed, watching as the first tendrils of the nebula reached out to envelop her ship. The red glow suffused the bridge, painting everything in shades of rust and crimson.

""Visibility dropping,"" Dom reported from the helm. ""Sensors showing seventy percent degradation. Navigational systems compensating, but it's going to get worse the deeper we go.""

""Maintain course,"" Aiko ordered. ""Riley, any change in the signal?""

The communications officer shook his head. ""Still broadcasting. Signal strength increasing as we get closer."" He paused, adjusting something on his console. ""There's... something strange about the modulation, though. It's fluctuating in a pattern I haven't seen before.""

""Interference from the nebula?"" Aiko suggested.

""Maybe,"" Riley said, not sounding convinced. ""But it's too regular for natural interference. Almost like...""

""Like what?"" Dom prompted when Riley trailed off.

""Like it's responding to our approach,"" Riley finished, looking up with a troubled expression. ""The pattern changed when we entered the nebula's outer boundary.""

A chill ran down Aiko's spine, but she kept her face neutral. ""Could be automated systems on the beacon,"" she suggested. ""Designed to guide rescue vessels.""

""After twelve years?"" Dom raised an eyebrow.

""You're the one who kept talking about how well-built those old ships were,"" she reminded him. ""Maybe the beacon's programmed to adjust its output when it detects an approaching vessel.""

It was a reasonable explanation, but doubt had crept into the atmosphere of the bridge. Aiko could feel it, an almost tangible tension that hadn't been there moments before.

""How long until we reach the coordinates?"" she asked, changing the subject.

""At current speed, eighteen hours,"" Dom answered. ""Assuming we don't run into any surprises.""

Eliza spoke up from her station. ""Captain, I've been analyzing the nebula's composition. There are unusual energy readings coming from the direction of the coordinates.""

""Define 'unusual,'"" Aiko said, moving to look over Eliza's shoulder.

""Radiation signatures that don't match the surrounding nebula. Concentrated pockets of ionized gas. And something else..."" She manipulated the display, highlighting a series of fluctuating energy patterns. ""These readings suggest active power sources. Multiple of them.""

""Active?"" Dom turned in his chair. ""After twelve years?""

""Like Maddox said, those colony ships had self-sustaining power cores,"" Aiko reminded him. ""If they're still operating on emergency systems...""

""Even emergency systems would have failed after a decade,"" Dom argued. ""Unless...""

""Unless what?"" Aiko prompted.

Dom's expression was grim. ""Unless someone's still alive out there.""

The possibility hung in the air, both enticing and terrifying. Survivors meant complications—legal issues with salvage rights, potential rescue operations, witnesses to whatever they might find.

""If there are survivors,"" Wei spoke up from the back of the bridge, where he'd been quietly observing, ""after all this time, isolated in a nebula with a reported contagion aboard... they may not be in the best mental state.""

""Or physical state,"" Eliza added softly.

Aiko considered this. ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves. All we know for certain is that we're picking up a distress signal and energy readings that suggest functioning systems. Everything else is speculation."" She straightened, addressing the bridge crew. ""I want a full defensive preparation. Shield generators to maximum. Weapons systems on standby.""

""We're a salvage vessel, not a warship,"" Dom reminded her.

""That doesn't mean we can't defend ourselves,"" she countered. ""Better safe than sorry.""

Dom nodded reluctantly. ""Fair enough. I'll run diagnostics on the defense grid.""

""Maddox,"" Aiko called over the intercom. ""How are the engines holding up?""

The engineer's voice crackled through the speakers. ""*Managing, Captain. The nebula's playing hell with our intake filters. I'm running purge cycles every thirty minutes, but we're losing efficiency. I'd recommend against any sudden acceleration or deceleration maneuvers.*""

""Noted. Keep them running as smoothly as you can. We may need to make a quick exit.""

""*That's reassuring,*"" came Maddox's dry response.

Aiko smiled despite herself. ""Just being cautious. Bridge out."" She turned back to the main viewport, watching as the nebula grew thicker around them, visibility decreasing by the minute. ""Riley, keep broadcasting on all standard frequencies. If there is anyone alive out there, I want them to know we're coming.""

""Yes, Captain.""

As the hours passed, the Vanguard pushed deeper into the Vermillion Nebula. The ship's external lights cut through the swirling crimson clouds, creating eerie patterns of light and shadow that danced across the hull. Inside, the crew went about their duties with quiet efficiency, but Aiko could sense the growing unease.

In the mess hall, during a brief break, she found most of the crew gathered, speaking in hushed tones. They fell silent when she entered, a sure sign they'd been discussing their concerns.

""Alright,"" she said, pouring herself a cup of coffee. ""Out with it. What's everyone worried about?""

There was a moment of awkward silence before Javier spoke up. ""The signal, Captain. Riley's not the only one who noticed it changing. Some of us were monitoring it from our stations. It's... reacting to us. To our presence.""

""And?"" Aiko prompted, taking a seat at the table.

""And that's not how distress beacons work,"" Maddox said bluntly. ""They broadcast. They don't interact.""

Wei leaned forward. ""There's also the matter of the contagion mentioned in the message. We're equipped for standard quarantine procedures, but without knowing what we're dealing with...""

""We're taking every precaution,"" Aiko assured them. ""No one boards any vessel until we've done complete external scans. Full hazard protocols for any boarding parties.""

""And if we do find survivors?"" This came from Eliza. ""What then?""

A good question. Aiko had been wrestling with it herself. ""Then we assess their condition and determine the best course of action. If they need immediate medical attention, we provide it. If they're stable, we contact the nearest Hegemony outpost and arrange transport.""

""And the salvage?"" Javier asked, voicing what everyone was thinking.

""Survivors or not, those ships have been derelict for twelve years,"" Aiko said. ""Under maritime salvage law, we have the right to claim abandoned vessels and cargo, provided we make reasonable efforts to assist any survivors.""

This seemed to satisfy most of the crew, though doubt still lingered in some faces.

""Look,"" Aiko continued, ""I understand the concerns. This situation is unusual, to say the least. But that's also what makes it potentially valuable. We go in carefully, we assess the situation, and we make decisions based on what we find. No unnecessary risks.""

Maddox snorted. ""Since when has that been our policy?""

A ripple of tense laughter broke the mood, and Aiko smiled. ""Fair point. But this time, we play it safe. I promise.""

As the crew returned to their stations, Dom lingered behind with Aiko.

""You've got them believing everything will be fine,"" he said quietly.

""Everything will be fine,"" she insisted.

Dom shook his head. ""You feel it too. Something's off about all of this. The signal, the energy readings, the way the nebula seems to be... watching us.""

Aiko started to dismiss his concerns, then stopped herself. Dom wasn't given to flights of fancy. If he felt something was wrong, it was worth considering.

""What do you suggest?"" she asked instead.

""Turn around,"" he said simply. ""Find another salvage opportunity. One that doesn't come with a twelve-year-old mystery and warnings about contagions.""

For a brief moment, Aiko was tempted. The unease she'd been suppressing since they entered the nebula surged forward. But then she thought of their dwindling supplies, their empty credit accounts, the years of barely scraping by.

""We need this score, Dom. You know that as well as I do.""

He sighed. ""I know. Just... promise me you'll listen if I tell you we need to abort. No arguments, no hesitation. If things go sideways, we leave. Immediately.""

""Agreed,"" she said, holding his gaze to show her sincerity. ""First sign of real danger, we're gone.""

Dom nodded, seemingly satisfied. ""I'll hold you to that.""

Six hours later, as the Vanguard pushed through an especially dense pocket of the nebula, Riley's voice cut through the hushed atmosphere of the bridge.

""Contact!"" he called out, straightening in his chair. ""Multiple large objects at coordinates zero-three-five mark seven-eight.""

Aiko moved to his station, heart racing. ""On screen.""

The main viewport flickered, then resolved into a magnified view of what lay ahead. At first, it was difficult to make out details through the swirling crimson haze. Then, as the ship's sensors compensated, dark shapes emerged from the mist.

Ships. Dozens of them, floating in a loose formation. At the center, dwarfing the others, was the unmistakable silhouette of a colony vessel—the Eidolon's Mercy.

""My God,"" Eliza whispered. ""They're all intact.""

Indeed, from what they could see, the fleet appeared largely undamaged. The ships drifted silently, external lights dark, but their hulls showed no signs of catastrophic failure or combat damage.

""Distance?"" Aiko asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

""Three hundred thousand kilometers and closing,"" Dom replied. ""We'll reach minimum safe distance in approximately two hours.""

""Any signs of life?"" she directed this to Riley, who was frantically working his console.

""No active communications beyond the distress beacon. No movement detected. But..."" He hesitated, adjusting his instruments. ""There are definitely power signatures. Multiple ships are running on some kind of emergency systems.""

""Scan the Eidolon's Mercy,"" Aiko ordered. ""Focus on life support systems, atmosphere, radiation levels—anything that might tell us if anyone could have survived in there.""

As Riley complied, Aiko moved to stand before the viewport, staring at the ghostly fleet emerging from the nebula's embrace. After twelve years lost in the void, here they were—a flotilla of ghost ships, waiting to be claimed.

""We found them,"" she murmured, more to herself than to anyone else. ""We actually found them.""

Dom joined her, his expression a mixture of awe and apprehension. ""Now we just have to figure out what happened to them.""

As if in answer, the ship's communications system suddenly burst to life, startling everyone on the bridge. The speakers crackled with static, then cleared, revealing a voice—clear, calm, and utterly chilling.

""*Welcome, Vanguard,*"" it said, the voice neither male nor female but something in between. ""*We've been waiting for you.*""

The bridge crew froze, all eyes turning to Aiko. She stood rigid, staring at the fleet of ships that now seemed less like potential salvage and more like a carefully laid trap.

""Who is this?"" she demanded. ""How do you know our ship's name?""

There was a pause, filled only by the soft hiss of static. Then the voice returned, carrying a hint of something that might have been amusement.

""*We know many things. We have had time to learn. So much time.*""

Aiko glanced at Riley, who was frantically trying to trace the transmission. He shook his head—he couldn't pinpoint its origin. It seemed to be coming from everywhere and nowhere within the fleet.

""Identify yourself,"" Aiko insisted, fighting to keep her voice steady. ""Are you a survivor from the Eidolon's Mercy?""

Another pause, longer this time. When the voice spoke again, it had changed—subtly at first, then dramatically, splitting into multiple overlapping voices, as if a chorus was speaking in imperfect unison.

""*We are the Mercy. We are the Fleet. We are waiting. Always waiting. Come to us. Join us.*""

The transmission cut off abruptly, leaving the bridge in stunned silence.

""What the hell was that?"" Javier whispered from his station.

No one had an answer. Aiko turned to Dom, seeing her own fear reflected in his eyes.

""Reverse course,"" she said quietly. ""Get us out of here.""

Dom was already moving to the helm. ""I told you this was a bad idea,"" he muttered, fingers flying over the controls.

Before he could complete the sequence, every screen on the bridge suddenly flashed with the same image: a bizarre, twisted symbol that resembled a fusion of organic and mechanical elements, pulsing with an inner light.

Then the Vanguard's engines shut down, leaving them drifting in the crimson mist, with the silent fleet growing ever closer on the viewport.

1iy6irk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PunkCapitalist/comments/1iy6irk/anyone_else_tired_of_startup_billions_or_bust/,Anyone else tired of startup billions or bust hype BS? Here are 10 books that helped me on my journey.,"I've spent the last 20 years building small businesses that never made headlines but kept me fed, housed and happily productive. E-commerce stuff, software, a couple of Etsy shops, even small manufacturing. Nothing fancy.

But man, is it just me or has startup culture gone completely off the rails? The whole ""hustle until you collapse"" thing, the VC worship, the idea that if you're not building a billion-dollar company, you're somehow a loser?

I started calling my approach ""punk capitalist"" recently. Just build something real, serve actual customers, make actual money. Three chords, three customers, and you're in business.

Anyway, thought I'd share some books that really helped me. Not the usual ""crush it"" garbage – actual helpful stuff for people who want to build something sustainable:

**Company of One (Paul Jarvis)** - Finally, someone saying it's OK to stay small on purpose. Read this after walking away from a group of investors who wanted me to 10x when I was already happy. I felt like I was failing and this was where I finally decided there's a spectrum in business and it's ok to exist in this part. In fact, it's pretty great!

**The $100 Startup** - Got this when I was struggling to get going after a couple of small ebay businesses had some decent success but I was lookng for something else. Helped me launch the next one with basically pocket change. No BS, pretty practical stuff.

**Rework** - The guys from Basecamp basically saying ""everything you've been taught about business is wrong."" Short chapters you can read over a cup of coffee. This confirmed my whole mindset. There's a free pdf out there. Worth grabbing.

**Small Giants** - Stories about companies that told investors to go pound sand so they could just be excellent instead of enormous. Really inspiring.

**E-Myth Revisited** - Old school but saved my ass when I was working 80-hour weeks. Taught me systems thinking without all the scaling hype.

**Profit First** - Completely changed how I handle business money. Been profitable from day one on my last few projects because of this approach.

**Anything You Want (Derek Sivers)** - The CD Baby guy. Short book about accidental success by just being human instead of ""strategic."" Feels like having a beer with a smart friend.

**Soul of an Entrepreneur** - Someone finally calling BS on how Silicon Valley has twisted entrepreneurship. Read this when you're feeling like a failure for not raising a Series A.

**This Is Marketing (Seth Godin)** - Find people you actually care about serving and focus on them. None of that growth-hacking garbage.

**Art of Non-Conformity** - Not strictly business but good for your head when everyone's telling you to follow the ""proven path"" (which is mostly proven to make you miserable).

**Dishwasher Pete** - I've probably given this book to more people that any other one. It's not really a business book in a traditional sense, but it always helped me to remember the bottom isn't as far as you think, it's ok to fail and there are nets to catch you if you are willing to put your pride aside.

Anyone else building businesses that prioritize freedom and sustainability over scale? What books have helped you? 

I'm always looking for more and I'm putting together resources for other folks who want to build businesses to serve their lives rather than consuming them. If you're into that kind of thing, let me know what's worked for you.",1,1740519260.0,PunkCapitalist,0,1.0,False

-I would like to pose a question to those of you who believe that Human Beings are creatures of free will; what if you saw a disturbing glimpse of your future in a dream, and no matter how hard you tried to avoid it, you ended up causing it to happen?

When I was just a 16 year old kid, before the advent of cell phones, streaming media, or even the internet for that matter, I didn’t know much about the ‘paranormal’ and things of that nature. No, my biggest pursuits were comic books, collecting Hot Wheels cars, and supporting my video game addiction over at the local arcade.
  
The year was 1978.
  
Anyway, so I got this little weekend job down at the swap meet (about two blocks from my house) helping out this old Chinese vendor named Chung. The job was simple; meet Chung at the Drive-in theater early Saturday morning to help set up his vendor stall with merchandise consisting of knock-off Gucci bags, pocketbooks, and assorted women’s shoes, then assisting him throughout the day. At the end of the day Chung would hand me a nice crispy $10.00 bill. 
  
I was making 20 bucks a week, which in 1978 afforded me the latest issues of Mad Magazine and collectible Hot Wheels, as well as a shot at that new video game over at the arcade called ‘Space Invaders’.
  
On one Friday night I sat on the edge of my bed, reached over to my nightstand and picked up my little alarm clock to set it for work the next morning. Swap meet vendors had to be there early so that they could set up and be ready to meet the throngs of shoppers coming in at 7:00 when the ticket gates opened.
  
My alarm clock was an old vintage wind-up handed down to me from my grandmother. It had a round face and two little bells on top that would ring when the hour hand reached the third hand, (also known as the ‘alarm hand’). I set the alarm hand for 5:30, wound the clock spring, and placed it back on my nightstand. I prided myself on being on time…a characteristic that was instilled in me from the time I learned to work for my own money.
  
I was an industrious young man of morals and integrity. I had the world by the horns… or so I thought.
  
I put my pajamas on and laid my work clothes out on a chair, then tucked myself in for the night. I must have slept extremely well that night. We’re talking deep R.E.M. sleep. The kind where time seems to no longer exist. Then I had a lucid dream. A very unsettling lucid dream. It went something like this:
  
I’m walking through a door, and there, about 30 to 35 feet in front of me was my boss, Chung, squatting down in front of his vendor stall that was completely set up, with purses and handbags hanging from hooks on the shade structure. His display tables were adorned with colorful tablecloths, loaded with pocketbooks, coin purses and other accessories. 
  
He was straightening a pair of red shoes he had arranged on the tarmac up front. I had missed setup. I was suddenly flushed with the realization that I was late for work. That feeling of pure anxiety washed over me like a bucket of ice cold water.
  
I stood shocked and dumbfounded as Chung looked over his shoulder and spotted me. He nodded his head with a grin and started to speak. But the sound that came out was not that of his voice, but a loud, steady ringing sound. The sound of a bell.
  
Suddenly I was ripped from my dream, and I bolted upright in bed to the sound of my alarm clock going off. It was 5:30 and time to get ready for work. I reached over and turned it off, then rubbed my eyes, anxious with that feeling of being late that lingered with repeating visions from that stupid dream. 
  
I felt like I had just closed my eyes only to be rudely awakened again. I shrugged it off and went to the bathroom to begin my morning ritual for work. 
  
But the dream kept replaying itself over and over in my head like a 10-second video clip stuck on a loop. The finished displays. The red shoes. The grin on Chung’s face. The feeling of being late. And what the hell was he about to say just before my alarm clock jolted me out of it? I just couldn’t shake it despite the fact that I had gotten up on time and there was nothing keeping me from getting to work on time that morning. 
  
Nonetheless, I picked up my pace a little bit just to make sure that dream playing out over and over again, and that feeling of dread that comes with showing up late for work, would just go away.
  
I felt a bit silly as I donned my clothes a little quicker, and tied my old suede wallabies a little faster than I normally would. I slipped my wrist watch on and checked the time against my alarm clock for a match. “This is ludicrous”, I thought to myself. “There’s no way I can be late. If anything I’ll be super early.”
  
I cut the time I would normally spend getting ready to go to work in half by skipping breakfast, and set out on foot at 10 minutes to 6 in the chilly morning darkness toward the Drive-in theater that waited for me about a block and a half away from my house. 
  
The light of dawn wouldn’t break for another half-hour or so. And, as it has been all season, my job was to show up around 6:30 a.m., meet Chung at our usual spot, and we would knock out the setup by 7:00…just in time for the shoppers to be allowed in. 
  
But this time it would be “a little bit different” I thought to myself as I shuffled down my empty street toward the quiet four lane thoroughfare.  Ignoring the crosswalk, I jogged across the thoroughfare toward the main gate of the Drive-in theater with its landmark forty-foot screen looming in the distance. 
  
The dream quickened my pace. I scoffed, and fought the urge to break into a run. 
  
It was unusually foggy that morning too. As I made my way through the shadows I couldn’t help but notice the ominous looking halos of swirling mist surrounding each street lamp. The theme song from ‘The Twilight Zone’ kept trying to seep into the cracks in my overactive imagination. 
  
And that damn dream. That dream was still fresh on my mind as I entered the gate and waved at the security guard leaning in the door frame of his guard shack. He recognized me with a nod of his head, his face half-lit by one single incandescent light bulb from within. He pulled the cigarette from his lips with thumb and forefinger and let out a puff of thick, gray smoke. “Here a little early, arencha?” 
  
I shook my head and shoved my hands in my pockets as I thought about how ridiculous it was for me to be here at this hour. There was literally no one there except for the snack bar/café crew in the center of the Drive-in  lot. I headed straight for it. I needed to get my head on straight. I needed a cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed donut. 
  
I walked into the café and up to the service counter. The place was completely empty  except for those bleary-eyed workers who were busy doing their morning prep for the coming rush of customers. “their day starts a lot earlier than mine”, I reckoned as I took in the aroma of fresh coffee and baked goods. 
  
I ordered my cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed with a $2 bill, and got two quarters change. I grabbed an Auto Trader magazine from a rack by the entrance and scanned the area for a good place to sit.
  
Through large windows I could see a panoramic view of the outside area. I spotted a booth and sat down from where I had an unobstructed view of our spot. I wanted to see Chung the moment he arrived so I could go out to greet him early. 
  
I felt so foolish as I stirred the sugar and powdered creamer into my cup, and chuckled to myself as the dream faded for now, my mind preoccupied by the taste of fresh coffee and the flavor of that old fashioned glazed delicacy. 
  
About halfway through my cup of coffee I glanced at my watch. It was 6:35 (about the time I would normally show up). By now the light of dawn was just beginning to illuminate the cloudless sky, and the fog that had invaded the early morning was gone. 
  
Vendors were rapidly arriving en masse, claiming their spots. The clinking and clanking of their shade structure poles reverberated throughout the Drive-in as the they got busy unloading their vehicles and setting up their vending stalls. 
  
Vendors began filing into the café to get their morning caffeine and sugar fix. I stared blankly at our spot. Empty. Was Chung running late? I knew that his commute was considerably longer. His old cargo van had seen better days. 
  
Something was not right. The spaces on either side of ours were already busy with vendors and their helpers skillfully fastening leg poles to corner pieces, and stretching canvas tarps with bungee cords for shade.
  
I stepped outside to use the payphone that was mounted on the wall next to the restrooms. I figured I’d call Chung at home to see if he was there. But the pay phone had an ‘Out of Order’ sign written in black marker taped across the coin slots. Go figure.
  
Back inside, I bought another cup of coffee with my last 50 cents. “Why not?” If Chung didn’t show up by the time I finished the second cup, I reasoned, then I guess he’d be considered a no-show. 
  
Heck, I could just go home and crawl back into bed for a couple more hours before the rest of my family started to rouse. Godzilla and Kung Fu reruns on Saturday morning. Yes, just what the doctor ordered. 
  
I looked over to our spot again. It was completely vacant, surrounded by a sea of shade structures, tarps, goods, with cargo vans, box trucks, and just about anything you could haul stuff in that had materialized across the tarmac of the Drive-in theater as far as the eye could see. 
  
If you’ve ever been to a swap meet you know what I’m talking about. It was now 7:00. It’s Showtime!
  
“Well, I guess that’s it”, I thought to myself as I stood up and drank the last sip from my coffee cup. Chung is a no-show. That whole dream was such a… well, it was just that…a dream. I was now free to go home and catch some shut eye, and to decompress from an otherwise stressful episode.
  
I headed for the exit on the other side of the now crowded café. Beyond it was my home less than 10 minutes away. 
  
Through the windows on that side I could see the shoppers starting to flow in from the ticket line and fan out through the isles of waiting vendors. 
  
I grabbed the doorknob and pushed it outward, and then I felt a strange rush kind of like Déjà vu come over me. 
  
“This can’t be…”, I struggled to reason, as I walked out the door and saw…him. It was the dream. Only this time, for real.
  
I gazed in existential horror at Chung who squatted about 35 feet right in front of me. He was straightening a pair of brightly polished red pumps on display on the tarmac…and I was late.
  
My jaw went slack as my coffee cup fell from numb fingers. “Chung?”
  
Chung looked over his shoulder in my direction. He had just finished setting up his stall. Every detail was there from the hanging handbags to the accessory tables and, well…you know the rest.
  
Chung’s gaze met mine; “Oh there you are!” He said with a sheepish grin, “Sorry, I forgot to tell you…I switched spots!”

In preparation for this day, we should probably start naming the smaller decimals of bitcoin.

I believe we should call these cutbits 

so .00000001 BC would be equal to 1 cubit

Thus would mean

.1 BC would be 10 million cubits  
.01 BC would be 100,000 cubits  
.001 BC would be 10,000 cubits  
.0001 BC would be 1,000 cubits

She has told me work for word “I know you’re greeting, and that you’re not very open and talkative but try to greet the customers” like good freaking lord it’s every five minutes. If they don’t hear “hi welcome in” every 5 seconds, they coach us. If they don’t hear us call out names over each other they coach us. If they dont see us write on ONE cup, they coach us. There is no room for mistake. We have to sew our mouths into a smile and blabber on and on and on like a robot. 

And get this. They want us to connect with tourists. Majority non-English speaking tourists. Tourists who only speak enough English to order a coffee and food. A few of us have Spanish as our native language but other than that, we don’t speak any other languages. No Russian, no French, no Chinese, no Korean, so how do they expect us to connect to them when they can barely order at the register? 

I get it, they’re probably getting a lot of push from higher ups and stuff. But at the same time, they gotta remember that they started off as baristas as well. They experienced peaks, they’ve experienced Karen’s and the stress of getting drinks out. They have the ability to essentially opt out of interactions with customers. We don’t. We have to put up with their constant “espresso you’re at 4 with a wait time of two minutes” “cold bar you’re at 2 with a wait time of one minute” LET US BREATHE FOR THIRTY SECONDS. THEY CAN WAIT. THEY CAN WAIT AN EXTRA 10 SECONDS.

I need out. I’m looking for new jobs ASAP because as much as I love my coworkers and the work itself, I hate this new push. I feel bad for all the new hires because they’re experiencing this push in their first week to two. Imagine that. You get hired and immediately they start hounding you to talk to customers. Let them get comfortable with their coworkers first! Let them get confident! Not everyone can immediately start conversations with random strangers. God. 

If corporate people see this, your approach is not working. I’ve gotten so many people who can automatically see that we’re exhausted and tired. If you truly want to get that cafe vibe that you claim to want to recapture with all these new initiatives, let us baristas foster genuine connections. Don’t pull our mouths in a smile and grab our hands to wave at customers. Let our personalities shine through because otherwise, we’re talking robots who make coffee. Humans don’t like robots.

I have been battling some hemorrhoidal symptoms for about 5-6 years now. It started with sensitivity in the perianal area.

Now, it also includes pressure and pain in the anal area that usually resolves with a bowel movement. Sometimes it does not resolve, but most of the time it does.

I had a colonoscopy 3 years ago and they banded one internal and it hurt so much. I was bedridden for 2 days. But, I had a good year afterwards where I could tolerate things like coffee and caffeine again. But then I started declining again and haven't been able to tolerate sugar, caffeine, or coffee.

Now my symptoms are pressure (pain 2-3), irritation around the entire anal area, rectal dampness (but no visual discharge). I had a new proctologist look at me, and they said they are too small to band.

I'm so confused and frustrated. Prep H will help but symptoms come back a week or two later. The banding I received during the colonoscopy helped immensely, but symptoms returned. 

How can such small hemorrhoids cause so many symptoms? The proctologist recommended pelvic floor PT but I feel at a loss. ",2,1740518695.0,hemorrhoid,2,1.0,False

""[https://www.amazon.com/DeLonghi-Espresso-Cappuccino-Stainless-EC260BK/dp/B08C96BG9H?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref\_=fplfs&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/DeLonghi-Espresso-Cappuccino-Stainless-EC260BK/dp/B08C96BG9H?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&th=1)""

I was wondering if this would be enough or if there is another low end model I can start with. I also have no idea what else I'd need for this coffee cart. Shakers? Press things? Espresso cups mugs etc.

Would anyone be interested in helping me identify some budget essential items I could get her. Trying to keep the total under $300 for everything (If that's even possible).

Appreciate any responses in advance, and sorry for my ignorance on the topic!",0,1740518665.0,espresso,3,0.5,False

Me ‘26/F’ boyfriend ‘M/29’ we have been dating for 5 months 
I know it’s a long time since valentine’s day but it stuck with me…
So my boyfriend lives an hour away from me 
I’ve told him that it’s my first valentine day not single and I would like to celebrate it and do something together!
I thought he will at least make a reservation and buy me flowers and a small gift! 
He did buy me a small gift ( a cat stress ball) 
But didn’t make reservation and we had to ask from everywhere decent if they had any room but nowhere after an hour we found a place that wanted us to eat and leave in half an hour, he didn’t pay for my food and after we want for coffee also didn’t pay for it but asked me all the time if I was okay 
When we talked about it, he said he didn’t know what I expected from him which is weird ( because we are in a whatsapp group with another couple and the girl sent a photo of her boyfriend playing her a song and giving her flowers) so he knew and I gave him an information that i wanted something special on this day and he did not do anything to it and saying that I said of course it’s nice to spent time together, what do you think of the situation?

(Asking for a friend),"I swear I’ve turned procrastination into an art form. Instead of diving into take-offs, material cost breakdowns, and labor hours, I seem to spend my time doing everything else—like re-organizing my desktop for the fifth time this week, checking the drywall prices (again), or convincing myself that now’s the perfect time to finally learn how to make an origami crane out of construction paper. 

I tell myself, Okay, I’m starting the estimate right after I grab lunch. And before I know it, I’ve spent 45 minutes analyzing why my coffee tastes different today and if my coffee machine is on the fritz. (Nah t’s fine. I’m just avoiding my spreadsheets.) Then I think, Okay, just a quick glance at last year's project bids, and 3 hours later, I'm comparing bid prices for project from two years ago and wondering how I ended up in this deep, dark hole of research.

I know I should be running quantities and calculating overhead rates, but instead, I’ve spent the last hour tweaking my Excel formulas—because it might make my life easier next time... you know... whenever I actually finish this estimate. But right now, that’s clearly not happening. Also, how did I end up watching a 10-minute video on how to calibrate a laser level?

Honestly, every time I sit down to do the estimate, I get distracted by some random part of the process, and before I know it, I’m checking unit rates, analyzing previous bids, or even reorganizing my folders—again.

I know the deadline is looming, and I know that I’ll probably pull an all-nighter the day before it’s due (again), but does anyone have any real, actual advice on how to stop procrastinating? Like, do you set alarms every 15 minutes to remind yourself to stop reading post on reddit? How do you guys manage to just sit down, focus, and plow through the hours of take-offs without feeling like you need a 3-hour break after every condition?

At this point, I'm done drawing a realistic picture of a raccoon with a pencil at the edge of the project drawings (because that's obviously more important than getting this estimate done). My procrastination is at peak levels

I am hoping to make a wholesome connection or two! I enjoy chatting, getting to know people, whether it's about something they are looking forward to, their hobbies, things they are dreading, etc. I think everyone has a nice story to share, so, what's yours?

In terms of my interests, in case that helps you figure out whether we would jive or not:

I enjoy baking (donuts and danishes are my fav things to bake lol), trying out new bakeries, coffee shops, traveling/checking out new cities, going to live events/concerts, reading a book (any recommendations?!), sports, feeding my friends (I love cooking as well), and just spending some quality times with friends!

[Michigan veterinarian faces theft charge after refusing to return homeless man's dog](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/michigan-veterinarian-faces-theft-charge-after-refusing-return-119174979)   



If the woman veterinarian thought the dog was being abused,  why didn't she call the police or animal control?   This shows a huge lack of respect for homeless folks just because they don't have a roof over their head.  And get this, she is refusing to give the dog back.  The homeless guy owned the dog for 15 years and she won't give it back.



Pasting full story here:

*GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- A Michigan veterinarian who said she rescued a distressed dog that was tied to a truck is facing a theft charge after failing to return him to a homeless man.*

*Amanda Hergenreder took the dog on a two-hour drive to her clinic, where she performed procedures to relieve a severe urinary tract infection and remove a rotten tooth. She named him Biggby and says the 16-year-old pit bull mix is thriving nearly four months later.*

*But the Kent County prosecutor said Biggby belongs to Chris Hamilton, who lately lacks a permanent home in the Grand Rapids area and claims ownership of a dog known to him as his beloved Vinny.*

*“I just want my dog back,” Hamilton, 57,* [*told WOOD-TV*](https://www.woodtv.com/news/target-8/veterinarian-charged-with-stealing-dog-of-homeless-grand-rapids-man/)*. “I had my dog 15 years. Never neglected him and, you know, we loved each other. I mean, I felt like I lost part of my body after that. Never felt the same after losing him.”*

*Prosecutor Chris Becker said it is a simple case of larceny, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum sentence of 93 days in jail. Jury selection for a future trial is scheduled for March 6.*

*“You don’t have a right to just take something because you feel something’s wrong. ... People have a very big attachment to their animals,” Becker told the TV station. “No matter where you are in life, what your stature is in life, be it rich, poor, whatever it is, this is something that’s important to an individual.”*

*Hergenreder said she was in Grand Rapids in November for a professional conference when she saw the dog tied to a truck near a Biggby coffee shop. There is no dispute that she called the police department and animal shelter and also talked to a shop employee.*

*“No energy, very lethargic,"" Hergenreder said of the dog. ""We carried him to our vehicle. It was just very sad.”*

*Hergenreder said she performed medical procedures at her clinic worth $3,000. She said he runs and plays at her home, adding that she is ""starting to slowly see the light come back in his eyes.”*

*Hamilton acknowledged that he tied the dog to the truck while he walked to a gas station. He said when he returned, about 45 minutes later, coffee shop employees told him ""some lady in a van came and took my dog, snipped the rope.”*

*Hergenreder's attorney, Miles Greengard, is offering a vigorous defense of the veterinarian. He said she fears the dog won't get the attention he needs in old age if she gives him up.*

*“Mr. Hamilton didn’t even take such basic steps as licensing the dog,” Greengard told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “Now he expects a benevolent doctor to give Biggby the medical treatment he’s been denied and needs moving forward, and then give the dog back?*

*“I think it’s an unfortunate situation all the way around,” Greengard said. ""But I’m glad Biggby is living his best life.”*

##​ Understanding the Need for ‍a High-Power portable Power Bank

Before diving into‍ the‌ specifics of the Targus **140W ⁣power ‍bank**, let's understand why‌ a high-power **USB-C⁢ power bank** is becoming increasingly essential. Modern laptops, notably⁢ those⁣ used for ‍demanding tasks like video ⁢editing​ or​ software development, ⁣require critically important power. Traditional **USB power bank** options with lower wattage often struggle to charge ‍these devices effectively,⁢ or‍ take an unreasonably long​ time. That's ⁤where a **power delivery power bank**, or **PD power bank**, ‍with a higher wattage output like 140W comes ‌into play.

For **business travelers**,⁣ the ⁣ability to quickly⁤ charge a laptop during a flight or in between meetings is invaluable. Imagine landing in a new city ‍and needing to respond‍ to urgent emails, only to find your laptop battery is critically low. A reliable **travel⁢ power bank** can⁣ be a lifesaver.

**Remote ⁢workers**⁣ frequently find‍ themselves‌ in⁤ situations where access to power outlets is ⁣limited. Whether working from a co-working space,⁣ a⁣ coffee shop, or​ even outdoors, a **high capacity power bank** ​ensures uninterrupted ​productivity. the Targus ​140W aims to be​ a suitable **work ​from anywhere power** solution.

**Students** also benefit from **laptop power bank** solutions. Carrying a heavy laptop and textbooks is already a⁣ burden; adding a ⁣bulky charger can be ‌cumbersome. A **portable charger** like the Targus 140W offers a lighter ⁢and more convenient option for​ keeping devices powered​ throughout the ⁣school day.

**Photographers/videographers** working in the field require a​ **fast charging power bank** to keep their cameras, monitors, and other equipment ⁤operational. ⁢Dead batteries can mean missed opportunities, making a **reliable power bank** a crucial‍ part of their toolkit.

**IT professionals** often need to power ​laptops and other devices⁣ while performing installations, ⁢upgrades, ‌or troubleshooting in⁤ various⁣ locations. A **power bank⁤ for‌ mobile ⁤workstation** ‍use ensures they can complete their ​tasks efficiently, irrespective of power availability.[[Explore Top rated targus 140w usb-c portable power bank on Amazon.]](https://wabashop.com/portable-power-bank/?kw=targus 140w usb-c portable power bank)

## Performance and real-World Usage

While the specifications sound‍ extraordinary, let's consider the real-world performance of the Targus 140W USB-C Portable Power Bank.

*   **Laptop Charging:** ​A ⁣140W output is sufficient to ⁤charge even demanding laptops ⁣like **power bank for MacBook** models and mobile workstations. ‌Expect to get at least one full charge for​ a typical ‌laptop, and potentially more for smaller devices.
*  ​ **Charging​ Speed:** The USB-C Power Delivery (PD)​ technology allows for significantly faster charging compared to standard⁤ USB ports.You ‌can expect ⁣to see your laptop battery reach a significant ⁤charge in a relatively short amount of⁣ time.
*   **Simultaneous Charging:** The multiple ports allow you to charge your laptop,smartphone,and other accessories simultaneously. However, keep in mind that charging speeds ‍may be reduced ⁤when charging multiple devices at once.

## Potential Drawbacks ⁤and Considerations

Despite⁢ its strengths, it's essential to acknowledge some potential drawbacks of the Targus 140W USB-C Portable Power Bank.* ​  **price:** High-capacity, high-wattage power banks tend to be more expensive than standard models.The Targus 140W **usb-c power bank** is positioned as a premium⁤ product,‍ so‍ be ‍prepared to pay a higher price.
*   **Weight:**​ A 24,000 mAh battery⁣ packs a significant amount of power, which also ‍translates to a certain amount of weight.While designed for‌ portability,it may still be heavier than some users prefer,therefore it may⁤ not be ⁣the **best power bank for travel** for​ all.
*   **Charging Time of the Power Bank ‌Itself:** Recharging a ‍power bank with such a large capacity can take a while. ⁤Be sure to factor in the charging time when planning your usage.*   **Compatibility:** While USB-C Power Delivery ⁣is becoming increasingly‍ common, some older devices may not be compatible with fast charging. Ensure your devices support USB-C PD​ for optimal performance.

## Alternatives: Exploring Other Power Bank Options

While ‍the⁣ Targus 140W **USB-C power bank** is ⁢a strong contender, it's always wise​ to explore alternative options before making a purchase. Here are ⁢some potential alternatives to consider:

*   **Anker PowerCore III Elite 25600 87W:** Anker is a well-known ⁢brand in the ​power bank ⁢market, offering a range of high-quality products. This‍ model provides⁢ a similar capacity and​ wattage output, with excellent reliability.
*   **Goal Zero Sherpa 100PD:** If you need something truly rugged, consider the Goal‍ Zero Sherpa 100PD.Designed for outdoor adventures, it ​offers durable construction and reliable power for your devices.
*   **Mophie Powerstation USB-C PD⁣ XL:** Mophie is another reputable brand known for its stylish and ⁤well-designed power banks. Their USB-C⁤ PD XL model offers a balance of power, portability, and aesthetics.

When ⁤comparing ‌alternatives, consider⁤ the following factors:

*   **Capacity:** Choose ⁤a capacity that meets your charging needs.

With some issues I still have this machine. Through about 1,5 year I've got DeLonghi ecp which was bought to modify but never make it that way. Lately I've got cafelat robot. With neo flex what I usually did was preheating on steam (till 85-90C on temp strip), dosing 13g and pulling around 33g, so ratio around 1:2,75. With the flair I've got so different mouthfeel, even with smaller, standard ratio like 1:2. I pull quite long shots 40-60s and it has usually fair amount of crema but the espresso doesn't feel oily. After breaking down crema it feels in mouthfeel more like moka. I tried to replicate this mouthfeel, body on other machines but no matter what, the espresso usually feels oily?, maybe more thick. Did you notice that difference? Is it due to neo flex basket (I use black basket, not pressurized), is it common among all flair models or is seen in different machines? The taste usually is more rounded with flair with less separation than robot but I'm assuming that it is due to the basket size and with 58 would be similar case. Also I like this coffee in the way it works for me as caffeine drink. It gives me plenty of energy without over energising, still without feeling like I would get adhd. I can drink it everyday without feeling like I build up caffeine tolerance. With other machines I usually get like peaks of energy and after some time there is crash. With flair I can also feel that ""kick"" of coffee while with robot or DeLonghi there is lack of it, it feels different.",2,1740517523.0,FlairEspresso,0,1.0,False

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

So I met this girl, the signs of attraction were there, not extremelly obvious or strong. It was on a week of sport course. We had fun there at evening and I really liked her. She asked some questions, but not too much. She did not hesitate when I took her to another room from everyone else. Sometimes she did open up to me, but she mostly was not very talkative with me. She might just be a not talkative tipe. I immediatelly recognised that as a possible problem, since I am also not too much of a yapper and very much adore the idea of just hanging back, asking questions and throwing in some Charlie Harper tease once in a while. 

Week after this sport activity I called her on the phone, was kind of short with her and maybe a bit freaked out. I was direct and did I think textbook call. Told her: Hey Name! How are you?
Her: Good and you?
Me: good.
Her: I am suprised you called ( I accidentally talked over her few times starting from here)
Me: I want to see you, when are you free to get together? 

She gave me the time without hesitation, I picket the date time and place and she agreed without hesitation. Maybe the phone call was a bit hectic but I was happy did it, I shot my shot. I sent her the location as she asked since she didn't know the place. 

Three days later the date came(could not stretch it further. I am busy as hell.) It was tuesday(today).

I showed up first, i figured out the coffe shop is full, so i waited for her, and told her we are going somewhere else since it is full. She said: ""and you have an idea where? Because I don't know this town"" I said: ""we are going to a different caffe"" I picked another nearby coffee from google maps.

We walked and I could already tell it is hard to get her to talking. Noticed awkwardness in her face for a moment. I also stupidly walked her the wrong way for a bit, but laughed it off and stayed calm. 

Anyways, we sat at the caffee, ordered drinks and it was a struggle to keep the converstion going. I thought about asking her the date questions from the article, but it did not feel right. Too much silence. Stupidly lookimg at each other and into phones. 

At some point she started speaking in womanese, but the meaning was clear: Bro, this is not goimg well, lets end it. 

She started asking me questions at some point and it seemed she is also trying hard to meke it work, but it was not working. At the very end when I agreed to her womaneese to end this, she started  talkimg about random inocuous subject. Possibly realising I am unfazed by ending it short.

Also when I understood she had enough, I must have gotten red like traffic light in the face, since my face burned from blushing.

So we finished our drings and I went along with her excuses. At least I got a hug goodbye.

The way I see it she lost her chance, I will not go out with her unless she suggests it. 

I am looking forward to talking to her girl classmates.

I think she just was not feeling it, but is it possible she is also bit of a dummy with boys as boys are with girls, but she does like me? 

Is it possible she will be comming back since nobody else will be like this with her? 

Should I consider giving her another chance? 

I did not kiss her obviously. Corey says you should go for it at the end of a date. It does not apply for this situation, right? 

I dont feel bad or too bummed about this. I am practising. I am happy I did it.

The lack of decent respect really flies out the window for some of you when you make too much money and have little to no understanding of real struggles.

Today, a marketting lady thinks i’m “garbage” so she drops off her trash coffee cup on my table and walks away. I’m clocked out and studying in the lounge downstairs but I decide not to take off my uniform because it’s cold. Is it difficult for you to take responsibility for yourself and throw out your own trash? I am not your maid. It’s crazy to me how you can go through 4+ years of school, earn a business degree and land a job, and still not have the social intelligence of basic human decency.

Few days ago, some “company” with a group of like 30+ came to harrass me on a weekend about partnering with another company upstairs and started getting upset at ME for explaining that it’s a WEEKEND and there is nobody else in the building. Refused to leave until she got a word from my boss so I had to bother him on his day off. Her sorry excuse for being here was “The CEO didn’t respond to my email that we were coming so we came anyway.” So you decide to burden 30+ people by bringing them all here and don’t have the courage to admit that you messed up the timing and had to cancel your nonexistent meeting? You’re teling me that you spent 4+ years in business school, came all this way, and still don’t understand basic organization and email communication? What in your bright mind thought this was a good idea? Let alone be horrendously sick and coughing in my face the entire conversation on top of your refusal to leave the building. Wear a damn mask, i’m honestly sick of this country’s lack of common decency.

Many other times, I get corporate people asking me to throw away and remake their drinks or food because it’s “not quite right”. People around the world are starving or dying in war are you’re too spoiled to realize how much waste you produce. I don’t care how much money you make or how much you can afford, waste is waste period. Be more mindful. Too much ice in your drink is not the end of the world. A croissant not looking “picturebook perfect” is not the end of the world.

So if you work a corporate job and making more than the average American,  you need to start being more aware of the way you treat other people outside of your social circle. For the most part, your spoiled brat behavior is ridiculous. I smile at you regardless because its my job to. Many are honestly kind and self-aware, but a lot of you seriously need to rework yourselves. People around the world are starving.

We were there recently and found some gems that I thought I’d share in case helpful for anyone.

1) *Lucinda Casa de Campo*
The owner, a gentleman called Miguel, cooks up a wonderful asado in his backyard most evenings. You’ll get a welcome vermouth, lamb empanadas baked in the stone oven, choripan, a nice cut of steak (we got vacio when we were there), dessert, and unlimited Patagonian wine. There will be a group of 15-20 people there and the goal is for people to mingle during arrival drinks and at the communal tables. We met some pretty cool people, and Miguel’s hospitality was very good (constantly offering more food, a wine top up, etc). It was USD 70 cash only per person, but he also accepted EUR. It felt like being invited by a friend to their house for a barbecue.

2) *Caminatas del Glaciar*
One of those excursions you won’t see advertised in town: you deal directly with the owner of the estancia (Luciano). They pick you up from your hotel in a small car (i.e., no tour van) and drive you to a very rustic estancia where you are welcomed with coffee/tea, you saddle up, and you embark on the most beautiful horseriding excursion with stunning views of the landcape and of the Perito Moreno in the background. It’s basically a two hour ride (with a panoramic stop halfway through), and then you stop for an ‘asado de disco’ sandwich lunch (i.e., a steak sandwich with wine) at a campsite by the river (you can freshen up in the river while the food is being prepared). You can repeat as many steak sandwiches as you want. You then ride back for an hour and they drop you off at your hotel. The groups are very small (max. 8 people I think) and the views are stunning. It is fairly pricey (around USD 200 per person), but I thought it was so worth it - my favourite day in Patagonia (and still cheaper than mini-trekking the glacier). It was cash only, but they also offered some flexibility to pay by card via a friend’s MercadoPago link (similar to Paypal). 

3) *Mayo Spirit Trek*
We looked at quite a few Perito Moreno excursions, and we thought this was the best value (around USD 150 including transfer from El Calafate). It’s a full day where you spend at least 4-5hrs on the (small) boat with the top deck open for taking photos and enjoying the view (i.e., way longer than the USD 60 one hour cruises would take you). They take you to two ‘virgin’ beaches/stops (no human infrastructure there, the boat lands directly on the beach) where you do forest treks (one goes to a waterfall). Our guide was so knowledgeable about the flora and fauna and the Patagonian forest was beautiful. You also get to see two other pretty impressive glaciers on top of the mountains surrounding the fjord. In the afternoon, you sail to the Perito Moreno, and you do a nice and slow sail all alongside the northern flank (which is more photogenic because the water is very blue, as opposed to the grey of the southern flank). You then disembark at the walkways/pasarelas for two hours (which we found to be enough) and then you sail back. This was just a little pricier than the bulk of the excursions that just drive you to the pasarelas and give you one hour on the boat, but you spend way longer on the boat, you see more branches of the lake and more glaciers, and you get two forest walks. I think it’s worth the slight top up. It seems to be the ‘new kid on the block’ of the glacier expeditions, so take advantage before prices go up. 

For those tempted to only spend a half day in Calafate, we really enjoyed our two full days on these excursions and our dinner at Miguel’s. We also recommend the Buenos Cruces Pasta Bar: some pretty original ravioli/sorrentinos dishes for very fair prices (including in terms of wine bottle prices) and lovely service. There is also a cat, if anyone else is drawn by that.

When I was hired on, they asked about planning employee outings, birthdays, parties, holiday catering, etc- typical office manager stuff. And I am all for it as I whole heartedly feel employees need to be SHOWN appreciation, not told. 

My 1st year here I did it all: you got a promotion, had a birthday, work anniversary, anything worth celebrating- I was ON IT. Ballons, card signed by the entire office, your favorite pastry, SOMETHING to make you feel special. I did this from May 2023 to April 2024- until one fatal day. 

My birthday is April 2nd and after celebrating everybody’s birthday all year, I was hoping I would be celebrated with a card or something as well on my birthday. Birthday came and NOBODY said a word to me- I was so upset I actually left work early. The funny twist: my boss’s birthday is about 2 weeks later. I debated it but wanted to be the bigger person so I still went out of my way to go all out for him: got him 3 balloons, a card, coffee cause he loves it, and a pastry of some sort. 

Here’s the kicker: On that exact day, he walks up to my desk and immediately goes “hey we can’t do this anymore. We’re not gonna have a budget by the end of the year so we gotta stop this” No Thank You, no appreciation or anything.
I was SEETHING- I probably spend MAYBE $30 a person and he never gave me a budget or told me to be mindful of money. 
He then proposes to celebrate birthdays TOGETHER if there’s 2 in a month, which sounds like a load of shit to me and I haven’t done it.

In fact, I stopped celebrating birthdays at all, barely did any holiday catering and essentially backed off due to feeling severely unappreciated. 

Here’s the kicker: 
The executives in the office birthdays are coming up (March 12th and March 30th- literally DAYS before my own birthday). 
I’ve already asked for my birthday off because I already know they dgaf but i’m really feeling the pressure to do something since it IS my job yet I STILL don’t feel appreciated or valued. 

Am I Overreacting or should I just do my job and act like celebrating everybody else’s birthday but my own being ignored doesn’t hurt the way it does? Fake it till I make it, type of thing.


TLDR: My boss is an asshole who doesn’t like to show employee appreciation and I’m wondering if I should still treat him and his team like I use to despite his attitude. ",1,1740515666.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

Travel is a huge part of who I am—I’ve been to Canada, the USA, Colombia, the Bahamas, and Mexico, and I’m far from done. Bonus: I speak Spanish, so we can plan trips to some incredible places!

When I’m not traveling, you’ll find me immersed in art, music, and film. I love discovering new songs, checking out art exhibits, and getting into philosophical debates over coffee. If you appreciate a mix of thoughtful conversation and playful energy, we’ll get along great.

For context, my fiancee (28F) and I (30M) love the idea of a Palm Springs wedding. We both live in LA and are planning a \~70 person wedding (mostly friends) with a total weekend budget of $120-125K. We went to a bunch of PS venues with a focus on smaller boutique buyouts as we initially fell in love witih the idea of having our entire party on-site with us for the entire weekend (i.e., hanging by the pool all day Saturday, getting breakfast / coffee in the am's, etc.). We almost signed a contract at Casa Cody as we absolutely loved the venue (and stayed for a night) - it had everything we were looking for between type of property, buyout terms, aesthetic. They came back just recently, however, and told us that due to new policy changes, 2026+ weddings would no longer be able to use the entire property and so at a $25-30K venue fee which was unchanged from prior years and already on the expensive side, we ruled it out.

We've been working with our planners on other potential options in the area. We didn't love any of the other small boutique buyout options in terms of feel / aesthetic (Ingleside, Avalon, etc), but one venue that did stand out to us is The Bougainvillea Estate which fits the look we are going for and also sleeps up to 28 - it's obviously not our entire wedding guest list, but we thought about it and ultimately so long as our most important friends and family can stay on-site, then that's okay with us and we like that the rest of our party can still come by to hang during the day.

We did have a few questions though for the group since we haven't found much info online (and we're too excited / anxious to wait to hear from our planners as if this doesn't work, we may need to fully start from scratch with locations):

\- It looks like it's in Indio versus Palm Springs. Are there any good nearby hotels that we could do a block at for the guests who would not be able to stay on-site? We really want to avoid people staying 30-40 minutes away downtown

\- The estate site suggests a 4-5 night minimum for peak. That feels like a lot so was curious if others felt that way, if this was negotiable, etc.?

\- Is the weather out in Indio / at the estate in particular any different than Palm Springs downtown? In particular, we are worried about high winds as we did go to a different estate venue that was \~40 min away from town and there were strong winds all night

Anyone whose considered or actually done a wedding party or weekend there - would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks so much in advance!!",1,1740515497.0,BigBudgetBrides,0,1.0,False

I was struggling to find a hospital or surgeon who could remove the small hump I had on my nose naturally (many rhinoplasties on Caucasian people in Korea look unnatural and creepy tbh...) 

I went to many different hospitals, some Doctors rushed me, some wanted to straighten my hump through strange methods or tried to rip me off but I'm so happy with my results now :) I'm roughly 3 months post surgery and I'm so happy with my nose at Eight Plastic surgery in Apgujeong area in Seoul. My surgeon was Doctor Joo Oh-Young (he speaks fluent English, did not rush me and was very honest about everything). 

  
On top of that, the English translator and all the staff are SO kind because I was TERRIFIED before surgery but they truly understood and helped BEFORE and after surgery. Yeah, I can't say a bad word against this place, it's also very clean and modern with free coffee and tea.

I went from using cascara sagrada nightly (which helps peristalsis) as well as LARGE amounts of magnesium and 10g psyllium husk daily (yuck) to have bowel movements (not to mention tons of coffee enemas and colon cleanses to have to feel 'cleared out'),.... to NONE of that (other than Vimergy magnesium at a *normal* dose) and successfully go potty now at least 2x a day.

Digestion is not \*perfect\* yet but what seems like my lifelong battle with desperately wanting to go #2 everyday and it being a gamble if it'd happen (unless I hyper dosed on the supplements mentioned above)... fast forward two months of healing... to going effortlessly in the morning 2-3 times a day....... Life changing!

**Here's what I implemented that I'd guess contributed per MM suggestions:**

* Vimergy magnesium
   * 2 capsules AM, 2 capsules PM
* Lemon water
   * 3 quarts generally, sometimes 4 per day - one with **ginger** in it
* CJ daily
* 2-4 inches aloe
   * 10 min prior to HMDS, 30 min after CJ
* 1 lb leafy greens
   * I think this really, really helped
   * Started at 1/2 lb, worked up to 1 lb (in smoothies or salads)
* Daily apples possibly
   * Not sure, but shouting them out just in case

They’ve brought this up in meetings as well, pointedly looking at me or jokingly saying my name like it’s directed at me.

So a bit ago me and my boyfriend took a break from our relationship as my bpd was creating mass tension. In my mind I assumed he no longer wanted anything to do with me and within 3 months of breaking up I began to pursue other people but never making anything serious. In November of 2023 I get a message from a number I wasn’t familiar with, it was him. 

He explains that ever since the breakup he never felt like himself, and fell into a deep depression. After a long discussion throughout the next couple days we agreed that we could maybe try to make the relationship work again, with me moving back in with him in March of 2024. Prior to me moving in I did ask if he had pursued anyone else during our break, with me being entirely open and honest with what I did with the people I met up with. His response being that he never tried pursuing anyone else as I was apparently all he could think about. 

A few months go by and everything is perfect.. 

Until I find a diamond earring on the floor. 

I have stretched earlobes. 

I immediately confronted him asking if there was someone else and that I didn’t care if there was because at that point I was emotionally exhausted, spiraling, and would rather just leave instead of fighting over the thought of a potential third person. 

He opens up and admits to sleeping with two other people during our break, hesitant to tell me in the beginning because he knew that I would act the way I was acting in that moment, which made me spiral even further. I felt lied to, and just sick to my stomach at the thought of him being with other people and not telling me about it. I explain to him that I didn’t care that he slept around, but more so upset that he hid it from me until I found literal evidence of it. He kept trying to do damage control saying that he just kept thinking of me the entire time (I don’t know why but hearing that part made me slightly uncomfortable) And that he never planned on dating them. 

He states that one girl was just there to keep him company for the night because he felt lonely, and the second starting out as “strictly friends” but turned into fwb. I come to find out later the second girl was around frequently (I found an entire pack of contact cases under the sink) which began my insane spiral of stalking this persons social media for any more potential clues. I come to find a picture of them at a club, her sitting in his car eating, and even discovered that they still followed each other Instagram, demanding that he unfollow her immediately which he does. In less than 30 minutes the picture of the two of them are removed from her profile, making me tweak the hell out further. Why take it down if you’re over him, have a boyfriend, and you’re “just hanging out with friends” like her post had said. Only when he unfollowed she removed the picture. Why not take it down beforehand? Or when her new boyfriend came into the picture? 

More recently she began posting cryptic stuff on her twitter (yes I know I’m insane for stalking hardcore) that I know references to my boyfriend. She posted a selfie with a McDonald’s coffee that my boyfriend would always get, with the caption “it’s crazy when you think about people that probably don’t think of you anymore.” There was no way it couldn’t have been about him considering the earlier picture I found of her in his car was of her eating McDonald’s and then proceeds to post that EXACT picture he took of her a year back on her twitter like right before the coffee post. 

She will also retweet posts of “missing exes and wanting to tell them she misses them.” This could all just be me overthinking and crashing out hardcore, but there’s just too many things that line up and feel like a direct reference towards him. I am in no way intimidated by this person, but am more so afraid of the idea of her reaching out to him. 

There are moments where me and my boyfriend have arguments and will cry after telling me that he loves me so much it hurts him, and that he wishes that I could just believe him and keep stuff in the past as he’s discussed the idea of getting married after completing school. He tells me he loves me every day at least a dozen times and I believe him, but being a stalker and fucking myself over with what I’ve found is really messing with me.

Occasionally I get the sensation that I’ve scalded my upper lip. It’ll feel like when you drink coffee that’s too hot and it burns your tongue/mouth roof and stop burning when I apply aloe or Vaseline to it.

The lip texture will be more pronounced in the area I’ve outlined. It’ll last 2-3 days then it’ll peel and go back to normal. 

I’ve just been assuming I’m not noticing my food or coffee is too hot and trying to make sure I let things cool down but this time I don’t think I ate anything too hot and it’s happened again I was just wondering if there was anything else it could be or if I am in fact just absentmindedly burning it.

Hopefully the link here works to show what I mean

This is a throwaway account and I did use the help of chat gpt for wording. I struggle with grammar and wording but I did re read it plenty to make sure it makes sense to the story. 

. A little under a year ago, I made the biggest mistake of my life—I cheated on my girlfriend with my ex. It wasn’t physical, but emotionally, I know that doesn’t make it any better. It was someone I had history with, and in a moment of selfishness, I crossed a line I never should have. She found out, and it broke her. I hate that I was the one to do that to her.

Despite the pain I caused, she chose to stay. We moved in together last September, and at first, it felt like we were moving forward. But even now, almost a year later, things still don’t feel right. She goes through my phone in my sleep all the time. I get why—I gave her a reason not to trust me. But it feels like we’re stuck in this cycle where she can’t move past it, and I don’t know if she ever will.

It’s confusing because we still have moments where we just laugh and joke like nothing ever happened. Some nights, we stay up late talking about the most random things, and in those moments, I feel like we’re still the same couple we used to be. But lately, those moments are fading. More often than not, she’s short with me, snappy, cold—like I annoy her just by existing. I don’t know if that’s the resentment creeping in or if she’s just over this relationship but doesn’t want to say it out loud.

And the thing is—I love this girl more than life itself. I do everything I can to make her life easier. I make her coffee every morning when she asks. I float some of her bills when money is tight, just to ease her stress. I’ve even sold some of my favorite cars (I’m a huge car enthusiast) just to make sure she could experience more in life. I never want her to feel like I’m holding money over her head, but sometimes I worry that she resents me for being financially ahead and that it’s driving a wedge between us.

For context, I made about $150K last year and am pacing for $250K this year. She made $34K last year and might hit $50K this year. I don’t care about the difference—I just want to build a life with her. But sometimes I wonder if she’s staying because it’s comfortable, not because she really wants to.

Last night, things came to a head. We went to the gym together (we both gained some weight after moving in, so we thought working out together would be good for us). My ex was there, and the whole thing turned into an uncomfortable mess. It made her mad all over again, even though I didn’t do anything. I didn’t even look at my ex. But just her presence alone sent us spiraling into another argument.

And now, another fight is brewing. I’m buying my grandfather’s house, and we’re moving out of the apartment. She’s upset because her name won’t be on it, which I get, but at the same time—it’s my family’s home, not just an investment. She says she doesn’t feel like it’ll ever be “hers” because she won’t have equity in it. I don’t know how to handle that. I’ve told her that we can still build a life there together, but I don’t think that’s enough for her.

Then there’s the fact that we come from two very different worlds. My family is close-knit, financially stable, and thinking about long-term plans. Her family has struggled with addiction and poverty, and I feel like that difference has been making things harder lately. She’s made comments about how she doesn’t really feel like she “fits” into my life, and I don’t know if that’s something we can work through or if it’s just too big of a gap to bridge.

I love her. I really do. But between the trust issues, financial imbalance, her changing demeanor, and now this house situation, I’m struggling to see if we’re building something healthy or just holding onto something broken.

So here’s where I need advice: How do I figure out if this relationship is salvageable? Is the resentment, the trust issues, the financial strain something we can actually work through, or are we just delaying the inevitable?

Any advice would mean a lot.",0,1740514804.0,relationship_advice,22,0.33,False
1iy4pwv,https://i.redd.it/2l1kiej3gcle1.jpeg,Damage Control: Beautiful Love?,"👋 I hope you've had a chance to watch Sasha's u/De-Influenced video on Birdie Mae.  IMO, this post was a mixture of doubling down & damage control. 

My dogs get excited if I say certain words or go to touch their leashes/harnesses.  Now that Birdie has gone on a few walks, the sound of keys could excite her for that potential opportunity. 

I think we can all agree that Birdie is forced to deal with Kylea's emotional lability (rapid mood swings).  I doubt she loves sitting in Kylea's Bronco in random parking lots.  She wants to be a dog.  She doesn't want to be held like the image above.

Do I think Kylea's watched Sasha's video?  Yes.  If Kylea loves Birdie, she will prioritize her needs.  Birdie deserves to act and behave like a dog and receive proper vet care.

☎️ Please call your veterinarian about any questions or concerns you have about your pet(s).

1iy4poy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1iy4poy/older_brother_loses_it_on_me_for_not_magically/,Older brother loses it on me for not magically erasing my father's child support debt,"Some background on my brother and our relationship is needed so let's get that out of the way. Hes my half-brother but that was never important to our relationship, his mom and my mom were friends for years, well until they weren't obviously. A mix of our moms new hate for each other and his behavioral issues as a young teenager we hadn't spoken for six years as of 2021 before I lived with him and my grandparents for a short time before having to leave due to his frankly insane and manipulative behavior. 

During the six years he was away.He lived with my father in colorado, this year my father moved back to our state with a new girl who quickly left him and I haven't heard from him since (his girlfriend wanted to ""repair"" us so badly it drove me nuts so im glad). 

Weeks later on the 12th, I spent the night with him his wife and infant son (as i sometimes do) where he lied so hard he couldn't keep a story straight and both me, his wife AND my grandma (the homeowner) made sure they spent time laying out the facts over coffee when we all woke up the next morning. To give y'all a taste

 He claimed he made over 100k in the last four months, he made 14k and pissed it away. 

He he raved about how he was such a good parent, he sleeps till 2pm and leaves the room when his child cries.

Even though he came up with all this and more he never mentioned our dad.

I left with a bad taste in my mouth, sick of his  stupid lies, and went home to prepare for the next day when my mom and baby brother were coming to town. 

A few days later (the 15th) i get this string of texts barely 4 minutes before I walk in the door

""Yo go to the court house and
tell them to tell your mom no
more child support

Dude dads in a fuckex up
hole cuz of [moms name]

Yea l just opened dad's back
tracked child support from
your mom!
TOTALLY not cool by any
means bro like what the
actual fuck

And your mom is living off of
enough of the governments
dime she doesn't need to be
fucking over dad THIS bad!""*

And yes he actually types that poorly. And on that last point, I get texts every month that tell me exactly how much money is in the child support card, and i'm also notified of every transaction, my mom is broke as a joke and he hasn't seen her in years. I really don't know where he gets his confidence.

We go back and forth for a while where he just acts like he knows how the court works

He sends a picture of half of an envelope with my father's name on it from the cp office and says he'll show me the numbers (spolier: he never does) 

He then spends the next forty minutes of my time  berating my side of the family and arguing that the reason that my father was in debt was because my mom was stealing from me, he then proceeded to threatened to, in his own words ""beat her ass if i ever see her again"" several times. 

He kept explaining how he wanted me to just walk in fill out ""15 minutes"" worth of papers and get all his debt absolved.

He somehow doesn't understand that its debt he owes because he didn't pay not because my mom ""stole"" from him. Everything i've read and everyone i've spoken to, even if I go in and ask it's out of my hands.

I really love his wife and my little nephew, and he lives in my grandparents house, and I don't know how long my grandpa has left.

Normally I would have tried harder to resolve things but my last great aunt has died the night before, I was a wreck and had to block him after he just kept crashing tf out.

 I feel so bad i probably won't be able to see my grandparents, or nephew for a while. The last time my brother went nuclear like this, we didn't speak for over a year. Any advice on what I should do? I know the trend right now is to ""keep your peace"" but I really don't wanna lose that part of my family. If anyone has any ideas i'd be glad to hear them.

The whole response to the baby loss was so bizarre with the performative IG videos when she still had her hospital band on?!?!?!?! The random men speaking over her womb?? I thought only God had any powers?! Also i really worry for their children, being homeschooled and indoctrinated by this almost crazed cult is worrying. Since when can children not enjoy innocent tv shows every now and again? Also the coffee thing? Saying that moms only need jesus they don't need coffee? WHAT?! It is so bizarre!

Some days are somewhat tolerable, and other days I genuinely wish to die. Just being honest.

Things that definitely help short term:

Dry needling - essentially western acupuncture, that helps sometimes for a few days and if I'm lucky a week.

Saunas/heat - doesn't need much explanation this is pretty ubiquitous for us all.

Occipital pressure devices like this one my Finance surprised me with (screenshot attached)

And the newest and most unconventional thing on the list: C4 energy drinks.
I know it sounds weird, and I did not drink it expecting it to do anything regarding my ON, but nevertheless, it really really does.

Specifically the black cans (ultimate energy) or whatever, but now after trying all the different lines from C4 I can say they all contribute to nerve pain/pressure relief.
I drank my first one early last week and immediately noticed something was different/better. Checked the can and realized there are CNS stimulants in the drink that are essentially extracts of compounds found in coffee/tea, but isolated and paired with things that aid in efficacy.

I do not claim to know why this helps. I'm surprised that a CNS (central nervous system stimulant) helps at all. I would've guessed it would irritate it. But nope. Been drinking one every day for over a week now and no tapering off of the relief or provides.

While I would love to understand the mechanisms at play here, I am perfectly content drinking my drink and having my relief. 

Curious to know if anyone else found something similar or if you try it what the results are.

The only really good location we've been to so far was Exclusive Coffee Bismarckstraße, it's the easiest for me to reach and I don't wanna risk going somewhere else and then nobody even shows up, so the format will be like this:  
I'll be at ECB every other sunday at 12, ready to do the meetup. If nobody shows up, I'll treat it as a very long coffee break.  
About the rhythm: There is a coffee meetup every two weeks organized by the people of the discord server with the same name as this subreddit and it's the same sunday I've designated for this meetup, so Imma swtich sundays yet again. The next one will be THIS SUNDAY (02.03.)!
