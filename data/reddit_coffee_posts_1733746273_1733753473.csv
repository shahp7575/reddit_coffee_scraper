1haah9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/EquivalentReturn4886/comments/1haah9w/start_your_day_right_with_breakfast/,Start Your Day Right with Breakfast,"https://preview.redd.it/o5ct34x8yt5e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=c76aaede10b08e908268411272b0f70b2dfe64c3

Breakfast isn't just the first meal of the day; it's a golden opportunity to fuel your body and mind for success. Whether you're rushing out the door, savoring coffee at your kitchen table, or juggling the demands of remote work, breakfast sets the tone for how you feel and function throughout the day.

# What Makes Breakfast so Important?

https://preview.redd.it/rws89az9yt5e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b5069591158e436eee9f92d34e18380d521327e

You’ve probably heard the saying, “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.” But why is this meal so critical? It all boils down to how our bodies work after a night of rest.

When you sleep, your body is in recovery mode—repairing cells, balancing hormone production, and metabolizing nutrients. But this also means you're running on reserves by the time you wake up. Breakfast jumpstarts your metabolism, replenishes glucose levels, and provides the energy your body and brain need to perform optimally.

Skipping breakfast leaves you running on empty, which can lead to fatigue, poor focus, and an increased likelihood of making unhealthy food choices later in the day.

# Key Benefits of Starting with Breakfast

1. **Boosts Energy**

Carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats from a balanced breakfast offer immediate and sustained energy. Foods like oatmeal, eggs, and whole-grain toast can help you power through your busy morning without hitting a mid-morning slump.

1. **Improves Mental Focus**

Research consistently shows that people who eat breakfast perform better on tasks requiring concentration and memory. A well-fueled brain is crucial, whether you’re working, studying, or managing a full household.

1. **Supports a Healthy Metabolism**

Breakfast helps regulate your metabolism. By eating early in the day, you signal to your body that it's time to burn calories, keeping your metabolic processes active.

1. **Helps with Weight Management**

Skipping meals often causes overeating later in the day. Breakfast eaters tend to consume fewer calories overall and maintain better portion control during lunch and dinner.

1. **Balances Blood Sugar Levels**

Healthy options like fruits, nuts, and whole grains prevent abrupt spikes and dips in blood sugar levels, giving you steady energy throughout the day. This is especially important for individuals managing diabetes or those prone to energy crashes.

# Common Myths about Breakfast

https://preview.redd.it/m8j8jklbyt5e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=c59b6420e2c03d5e5b351f8f9420dfe1c173dfcf

Some people avoid breakfast due to popular misconceptions. Let's clear those up.

**""Skipping breakfast helps with weight loss""**

This couldn't be further from the truth. Skipping breakfast often leads to overindulging during later meals, as hunger overrides better judgment. It might also slow down your metabolism, making it harder to burn calories efficiently.

**""I'm not hungry in the morning, so I don't need breakfast""**

It’s okay to eat light if you don’t have a big appetite early in the day. But skipping altogether might affect your energy. Try small portions like Greek yogurt, a banana, or a handful of nuts to ease into the habit of eating breakfast.

**""All I need is coffee""**

While coffee can boost alertness, it doesn’t provide the nutrients your body needs to function well. Pair coffee with a balanced meal to maximize its benefits without the caffeine jitters.

# Easy Ways to Make Breakfast Work for You

If breakfast seems like a chore or you feel crunched for time, here are some simple solutions to fit it into your routine.

**1. Plan Ahead**

Prepping breakfast the night before can save precious minutes during busy mornings. Try making overnight oats or chopping fruits you can grab and layer over yogurt.

**2. Keep It Simple**

https://preview.redd.it/vjql3nydyt5e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=c70e543d06c82b5733c15b4ea1ddcf7a1525e1a2

Breakfast doesn’t need to be fancy. A boiled egg, avocado toast, or a smoothie can take less than five minutes but is packed with nutrition.

**3. Incorporate a Variety of Foods**

A balanced breakfast consists of three main components:

* **Carbohydrates** for energy (e.g., whole-grain bread, oatmeal, fruit)
* **Proteins** for sustained fullness (e.g., eggs, yogurt, nuts)
* **Healthy Fats** for brain function (e.g., avocado, seeds, peanut butter)

**4. Stay Consistent**

A habit of eating breakfast trains your body to expect nutrients early, making hunger cues more predictable and meals more balanced throughout the day.

1haadz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OOALMarketing/comments/1haadz3/sponsored_discover_michael_jacksons_incredible/,Sponsored *Discover Michael Jackson’s Incredible Secrets to Business! Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1733752966.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

1haabif,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1haabif/i_have_no_idea_why_it_ended/,I have no idea why it ended,"I’m hurt and I don’t know why and I really need some answers because im going crazy

This is my first time posting so bear with me the story is in two parts. First part is 4 years ago, and the second part is a month ago until now for the sake of the story she will be Ava, my ex Eve. I started seeing this girl a month ago and she ended things last week. 
First part:
So I met Ava 4 years ago through a friend of mine, he was seeing her at that time and I was in a pretty committed but toxic AF relationship. Ever since we met (Ava and I) we would always talk the most, like I would see her once in 4-5 months but we had that flow in our conversation and we always understood each other but it was just that at least I thought so. I just wasn’t mature enough to notice the feelings developing between us. So my friend ended things with Ava and I was out of my committed relationship with Eve. I invited Ava out and things happened but we didn’t go all the way. Even though both of us were technically single we both felt horrible about what happened and we started drifting apart. Unfortunately I got back with my ex and she got back with my friend so things got out of control. I lost that friend but somehow Eve didn’t break up with me and that was the end of that.

Second part:
It’s September at this point. It’s been 4 years since the first thing happened and 2 years since my final break up with my ex(Eve). Ava and my friend somehow continued going out and things got serious between them in the 4 years that have passed. So I’m going to the store to get food even though I always order, that day I went. I walk in the store and turns out she works there. So we act like we don’t know each other and nothing happens. Keep in mind I’m 2 years single now, I was seeing other people but it wasn’t anything serious and I honestly never really connected with any of them. So I’m sitting on tinder, and I see her on there so I follow her on instagram and we just started talking again. It just came so natural it’s insane when I think about it. We were talking 24/7, like you could feel how much we wanted to talk to each other and be around each other. But she was fresh out of that relationship with my former friend and she would vent to me which I didn’t mind. I was alone when I was going through my breakup so I understand how it feels when you have no one to talk to. When Ava was venting she would also say things about me like “I don’t want to hurt you”, “ I’m not in the correct headspace right now” but at the same time she would say “Im becoming happy because of you”, “you give me purpose”, she would get out of work to bring me hot food on my door in the morning and she would leave it on the handle so she wouldn’t wake me up. It just felt like the right thing and the right person. So I go out of town and we get in a little argument over text. The argument was about our communication and how her saying certain things are affecting me and I wanted clarity and she got really defensive and she told me don’t call me again. So we didn’t talk for a few days, I message her the day I come back and we started talking again. I come back, she was sick but she still came over. We talked and we were able to come to common ground and resolve the situation. So we dont see each other the next day and everything is normal. We go out the day after for coffee and a walk and we start talking. Ava brings up her friends new boyfriend and how he makes her happy, how he has 4 cars, he has a car for every mood. So I ask her is that what you value in people and she started getting defensive and telling me how she meant that he was just very successful, how he created something from nothing. After we finish our coffee we head to my place and we started talking again. She was again saying how she isnt in the correct headspace how she wants to see me happy with friends or a girl but never with her. So I message Ava that night and I told her that our recent conversations aren’t sitting well with me and we need to change something because this path won’t take us to our wanted destination. At which point she tells me she’s not sure about herself or anything, not to call her or message her again and she blocked me from everywhere. She blocked my number and every social media. 

I don’t know why I am this hurt by this whole thing. I haven’t been myself for a week. I can’t focus on anything and it feels like my soul hurts. Like I have this constant emptiness and I can’t stop thinking about her. It’s not like there wasn’t anyone before her. I was seeing people for way longer and it wouldn’t even get to me.

1haab7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1haab7l/are_basking_ridge_or_bernardsville_a_good_fit_for/,Are Basking Ridge or Bernardsville a good fit for our family?,"We are considering relocation to Basking Ridge or Bernardsville because we have a lot of family there (my parents, sibling, their kids who are young like my kid) and could use the extra family support. A few noteworthy points:

1. I have a daughter with anxiety, level one autism, and ADHD. We currently live in North Carolina and have heard that the resources for children with these diagnoses are better in New Jersey than where we are now. I looked at the school reviews and it looks like the local public middle and high schools are great for high achieving children, but wasn’t sure about the above. My daughter is intellectually gifted but has a 504 for emotional/behavioral. Does anyone have any experience or know of whether these school districts would serve a child like this well? I went to elementary and middle schools in Bernardsville but did not have the same issues and thrived there but that was decades ago. Not sure if/how things have changed. 

2. We are remote workers and our home budget is not in excess of one mil. Obviously, this is a very high cost of living area, and I wondered about nearby towns where cost of living was lower; however, as we get further from Basking Ridge, our families are less available to help provide transportation and support which we need. We also want to stay very connected to family. It seems we are still able to get into the housing market at that price but what we get for our money is nowhere near what we get for our money and other places such as where we live now.

3. Sense of community: when I was growing up in Bernardsville, I felt like there was a sense of community. People hung out at the Bernards pool and other places. I’m not as familiar with basking Ridge, but just from what I’ve seen things seem a little bit less that way as far as people coming together. Any comments on that would be welcome. Not looking for malls, but I enjoy talking with people in parks or at bagel places or coffee shops. Community events for the kids are nice. Not sure how the library system is there but in Bernardsville, the library system was pretty awesome when I grew up. I practically lived there and the pool.  How is sense of community in Bernardsville and basking ridge these days?

1haa3e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1haa3e7/first_mechanical_keyboard_mystical_revelation/,"First mechanical keyboard, mystical revelation","For context, I have never had a mechanical keyboard in my life before. The only mechanical keyboard experiences I've had were with some of those old greige keyboards that came bundled with your pc, and that was also a rare experience, because I've never owned a pc before (that's right, laptops only for my whole life).

So recently I've finally landed in a good enough spot to allow myself a full custom-built pc, and for the first time in my life I bought a keyboard. It's the Royal Kludge RK61, chosen because it had four and a half stars out of two reviews on [pcpartpicker.com](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com). It even sat on my coffee table for a week as I was waiting for the other parts to arrive.

But, today, I saw a video on custom keyboards on youtube and decided to see how removed my blind purchase actually was from that thing I could hear -but not feel- on my display.

Boy.

I was not expecting the heavenly sensation that I got. It was like each keystroke massaged the soul of my hands, my arms were tingling from the sheer satisfaction that I was feeling. I am *not* exaggerating, they were actually tingling.  
The sound was not the deep thoc that you hear in mechanical keyboard asmr videos, but it was still a nice, not-too-loud and not-too-quiet dull clack that sounded like I could listen to it for hours. I've never loved clicking a spacebar so much.  
And, I've done *nothing* to this keyboard, no lubrication, no selected switches, no nothing else.

Maybe I was just lucky that this random thing I bought uncannily aligned, magically and mysteriously, with my previously undiscovered preferences, but if messing around with switches and lubrication and keycaps and activation pressure and backplates gives you back as much of a difference in experience as I've had from this keyboard when compared to a run-of-the mill one, I can totally see why people would spend hundreds on them.

My eyes have been opened.

1haa2tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1haa2tv/temporary_feeling_last_4_days/,Temporary feeling last 4 days,"Greetings,
I will try to be brief. I've done a temporary filling which only lasted 4 days. I've read it lasts weeks, or even months on average, so I find it odd, also because it's my understanding that even in people who barely brush their teeth...the filling last a couple of weeks (i might be wrong).
I am trying to understand if this happened because the dentist got it wrong somehow, or if it is possible that's more of a ""me"" problem, before starting to put this idea out there to anyone. 

The ""dentist taste"" took a long time to disappear, and then when it almost did, but part of the temporary filling fell off, and the taste came back again, and much stronger, during 2 hours. Now is weaker again. 

So, here's what I find relevant about me:
- I drink way more coffee that I should
- I wash my teeth everyday, around twice a day, and with a oral mouthwash at least once, but sometimes twice
- I have a slight vitamin D defficiency, and suffer from gastric reflux - A/B on a severity scale from A to D. I am tooking my meds everyday.
- I didn't eat anything too hard. I ate meat, but it wasn't even hard meat. I also don't drink any alcohol, or smoke. I almost only drink water besides the coffee part, and water with high pH. I don't eat many cookies, and I very very rarely eat any sweet. I ate yoghurts, some cereal bars (not great ik),some fruit, chicken, bread, maybe pork but nothing hard.

Breakfast isn't just the first meal of the day; it's a golden opportunity to fuel your body and mind for success. Whether you're rushing out the door, savoring coffee at your kitchen table, or juggling the demands of remote work, breakfast sets the tone for how you feel and function throughout the day.

# What Makes Breakfast so Important?

https://preview.redd.it/536j26oost5e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f2f2cce0da88eab4b0f45a30948f2ddb188e5be

You’ve probably heard the saying, “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.” But why is this meal so critical? It all boils down to how our bodies work after a night of rest.

When you sleep, your body is in recovery mode—repairing cells, balancing hormone production, and metabolizing nutrients. But this also means you're running on reserves by the time you wake up. Breakfast jumpstarts your metabolism, replenishes glucose levels, and provides the energy your body and brain need to perform optimally.

Skipping breakfast leaves you running on empty, which can lead to fatigue, poor focus, and an increased likelihood of making unhealthy food choices later in the day.

# Key Benefits of Starting with Breakfast

1. **Boosts Energy**

Carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats from a balanced breakfast offer immediate and sustained energy. Foods like oatmeal, eggs, and whole-grain toast can help you power through your busy morning without hitting a mid-morning slump.

1. **Improves Mental Focus**

Research consistently shows that people who eat breakfast perform better on tasks requiring concentration and memory. A well-fueled brain is crucial, whether you’re working, studying, or managing a full household.

1. **Supports a Healthy Metabolism**

Breakfast helps regulate your metabolism. By eating early in the day, you signal to your body that it's time to burn calories, keeping your metabolic processes active.

1. **Helps with Weight Management**

Skipping meals often causes overeating later in the day. Breakfast eaters tend to consume fewer calories overall and maintain better portion control during lunch and dinner.

1. **Balances Blood Sugar Levels**

Healthy options like fruits, nuts, and whole grains prevent abrupt spikes and dips in blood sugar levels, giving you steady energy throughout the day. This is especially important for individuals managing diabetes or those prone to energy crashes.

# Common Myths about Breakfast

https://preview.redd.it/xuacuvbqst5e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d7ef42702b9584928e123c601582f35355d35ed

Some people avoid breakfast due to popular misconceptions. Let's clear those up.

**""Skipping breakfast helps with weight loss""**

This couldn't be further from the truth. Skipping breakfast often leads to overindulging during later meals, as hunger overrides better judgment. It might also slow down your metabolism, making it harder to burn calories efficiently.

**""I'm not hungry in the morning, so I don't need breakfast""**

It’s okay to eat light if you don’t have a big appetite early in the day. But skipping altogether might affect your energy. Try small portions like Greek yogurt, a banana, or a handful of nuts to ease into the habit of eating breakfast.

**""All I need is coffee""**

While coffee can boost alertness, it doesn’t provide the nutrients your body needs to function well. Pair coffee with a balanced meal to maximize its benefits without the caffeine jitters.

# Easy Ways to Make Breakfast Work for You

If breakfast seems like a chore or you feel crunched for time, here are some simple solutions to fit it into your routine.

**1. Plan Ahead**

Prepping breakfast the night before can save precious minutes during busy mornings. Try making overnight oats or chopping fruits you can grab and layer over yogurt.

**2. Keep It Simple**

Breakfast doesn’t need to be fancy. A boiled egg, avocado toast, or a smoothie can take less than five minutes but is packed with nutrition.

**3. Incorporate a Variety of Foods**

A balanced breakfast consists of three main components:

* **Carbohydrates** for energy (e.g., whole-grain bread, oatmeal, fruit)
* **Proteins** for sustained fullness (e.g., eggs, yogurt, nuts)
* **Healthy Fats** for brain function (e.g., avocado, seeds, peanut butter)

**4. Stay Consistent**

A habit of eating breakfast trains your body to expect nutrients early, making hunger cues more predictable and meals more balanced throughout the day.

1ha9ris,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1ha9ris/the_final_discard/,The final discard,"I had limerence since 2021. I was abused by my ex, and as a coping mechanism, I developed limerence for a public figure after I sent them an email, never expecting a response. The harder the person was to obtain, the more I sought after them. I wanted them because I was emotionally unavailable myself after my ex's abuse. Mind you, I didn't realize this until way later, so the process was confusing and hurtful.

Surprisingly, this public figure has entertained me since 2021. Maybe they felt bad rejecting me, or they liked the adoration. I got them to meet my best friend in person in 2021 since they worried I was a spy set out to destroy them. They got along well, and my LO wanted to see me. I tried to make plans, but they’d ghost me, which strengthened the limerence.

They blocked me this summer on Instagram when I pushed my annoyance too far. My mental health had been awful that summer, and I was hopeful when they blocked me because I desperately wanted to move on.

This fall, we reconnected over iMessage, which they didn’t block me on. We even made plans to meet two times (I lied, saying I would be in their city, but I didn’t fly out due to weather or changing my mind, realizing how psycho I was being). I was so close to finally meeting them.

Then I noticed their boat was docked in my city on the West Coast, which was rare for them. As a last hurrah, I wanted to see the boat. Last week, I sent them a video of the boat. They said I was a stalker but added a laughing emoji. They told me they were not on the boat and that we can’t meet because they have a significant other now.

I’m not sure I believe them, but it doesn’t matter because they still rejected me. They could see my friend platonically, but not me? I was honest with them, saying the reason this situation affected me so much is because they met my friend in person platonically yet couldn’t do that for me, which was hurtful. My LO didn’t respond. However, I was glad I was forthcoming and honest with my feelings. Doing that and not getting a simple response spoke volumes. They knew they were hurting me yet didn’t care. I even sent another text saying it would have been nice to meet, but I see they’re back to their old elusive habits—and still no response. I deleted their contact information and won't bother reaching out again since I know I tried every angle. 

Ok, so now I have been rejected for 3.5 years. Now my brain understands there is no future. For God’s sake, they are in my city and won’t even see me for coffee. That stings.

On the bright side, I am over the abuse from my ex, probably in conjunction with limerence distracting my brain long enough, so I understood what my brain was trying to do. For that reason, the limerence was a blessing and a curse.",1,1733751088.0,limerence,0,1.0,False

1ha9mtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1ha9mtj/help_im_going_insane/,Help I'm going insane ,"
Hi guys, girls, gays, and they's!

I think I'm going crazy, and I need a different perspective on this whole situation. I'm overthinking and overanalyzing nearly every moment I share with her since the very beginning. She's my coworker, I think she gives me mixed signals, and as if that isn't bad enough, she has a boyfriend, and I don't even know if she's into girls. On some days, I think there's a special connection or at least some sort of unspoken tension between us. The other day, I think she doesn't even like me because she behaves distantly, and her body language is off. I need someone to humble me and get me out of my delusion!

For more context: We both started working at the same company on the same day, more than a year ago. We're the only women working there, in a male-dominated field. So we've kind of had each other's backs since day one, sharing our experiences and complaining about mansplaining or sexist comments.



I think the best way to explain this is to list the things that have happened since we've known each other:

- On our first day, I was so nervous and focused on myself and everything I was being taught that I didn't really notice anything about her. On the second day, she came in fully dressed in work clothes, and my gaydar went crazy.

- We were sent to a workshop together three days after starting the job. She's super extroverted and open, and I'm the complete opposite. She talked the whole time, and I listened carefully. To my surprise, she started telling me a lot of private and intimate things about herself, and it wasn't just small talk or getting-to-know-each-other stuff. I'm used to people trusting me with things quickly, but not in a collegial relationship and certainly not after three days.
She also told me that she has a boyfriend that day, and I was like, ""What? No?"" because my gaydar had never failed before.

- After a while, I noticed that I was getting nervous whenever she was near me. I couldn't really get my tasks done because I even forgot basic stuff when she was around. I know, it's so embarrassing, right? I'm still quite nervous when she's super close, but I’ve gotten more relaxed the more I got to know her.

- Somewhere around that time, we started having eye contact. By eye contact, I don’t mean quick, shy glances—I mean soul-staring. And while we're staring, we're both not saying a single word until the other looks away. The thing is, it's not awkward at all, and we still do it to this day. This is where I started to slowly fall for her. Her ice-blue eyes stand out and tell so much.

- An older female coworker in our company's office, who doesn't have much to do with us, told us that she knew we would get along from seeing us on our first day. She thinks we have a deep connection. She observed that we could have whole conversations without ever speaking a word. (Like, how does she know, and why does she know?)

- When talking to each other, we also have strong eye contact, and we're both smiling like weirdos.

- At our Christmas company party last year, I might have been a little drunk. As a goodbye, I opened my arms for a hug while she was still standing a few steps away. She said, ""Awww,"" and came into my arms without hesitation. After a little while, I let go, and she was happily smiling at me with that special spark in her eyes.

- She normally initiates physical contact, and that confuses me the most. Sometimes she touches or rubs my shoulder for no reason. From time to time, she puts her arm around me, either to show me something or just because. Sometimes, when we sit next to each other, our knees touch, and neither of us moves away. But she has never hugged me; it’s always me hugging her. When we hug, it’s not an awkward, normal three-second hug—it’s always longer and tighter than that. It feels like the best thing in the world.

- When there's something in my hair or on my clothes, she removes it. All in all, she's really attentive, and that makes me melt. I started to do the same in reverse at some point. She just looks at what I’m doing, smiles when she realizes, and then carries on with what she was doing.

- I complimented her new hairstyle; she blushed and smiled from ear to ear the whole day. She must’ve remembered it because when I cut my hair a little shorter, she gave me the same compliment, and it made my day.

- She mentions her boyfriend and her relationship at every chance there is—both the good and the bad parts. Adding to that, she also talks a lot about her ex-partners.

- One of our coworkers asked me if we’d known each other before. We seemed so close to him, like we’d known each other for years. When I told her about this, she got awkward and stopped talking to me for four days. Like, why? What's the reason?

- She read dating profiles of contestants on a dating show we’re both obsessed with watching to me. When she mentioned a woman’s profile, I was like, ""Nah, that’s a no-go for me; I wouldn’t date her."" She looked over at me, went all quiet, and ignored me for the rest of the day. It was the first time I hinted that I’m not straight to her.

- Shortly after that, she showed me a new mug she bought, and I had to look twice because it was basically the bi-pride flag, just in neon colors. I didn’t know if I should take that as a sign or not back then, but writing this down seems like a pretty obvious sign to me, idk.

- Out of work, we hung out together about three times. The last time we had coffee, she mentioned that her boyfriend doesn’t like it when she’s with me, so we stopped.

- She texts with others but not really with me. When I write to her, she answers immediately, but she only texts me if she really needs something. Somehow, she’s more of a talker than a texter when it comes to me.

- There are days when she can’t even look at me or completely ignores me for no apparent reason, and then suddenly, she’s all bubbly and talkative again.

- She recently told me she was at a festival, at a concert with a ""bi-singer,"" and asked if I knew her. I told her that I know her name but don’t listen to her music.
1. Why did she mention the artist’s sexuality before mentioning her name?
2. I looked up the festival, and the singer was never at that festival or gave a concert there this year. However, I know she was at that festival—she showed me pictures and videos, and she even wears merch. So why lie about being at a concert by an artist who wasn’t there? Seems odd, right?


- Whenever one of us enters the room, the other always notices. I mostly try my best to look disinterested or not seem obvious while staring at her. I know damn well she’s in a relationship, so I try my best not to get my hopes up. Most of the time, I can’t take my eyes off her and have to remind myself of that.
She, on the other hand, is super aware of me. She actively searches for my eyes, no matter how far or close we are from each other. Sometimes I catch her staring at me, but she doesn’t look away. She either keeps looking until I look away or starts talking. She doesn’t even hide… whatever this is.

- I also searched for body language cues in my frustration, but I started overanalyzing her behavior even more. Here are some examples:
a. She often raises her eyebrows when she sees me for the first time in a day.
b. Sometimes I catch her looking at me with a special spark or some kind of admiration in her eyes.
c. When someone tells a joke, I sometimes catch her looking at me to see if I’m laughing too.
d. Lately, she’s started pressing her lips together whenever she sees me, but I don’t know why. My first thought was, ""She hates me,"" but that doesn’t match the other things that have happened.

1ha9m7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ha9m7b/next_endgame_grinder_2000/,Next EndGame Grinder? [$2000],"Hey everyone,

I’m currently a proud owner of an EG1 and a Linea Micra. I use the EG1 from Weber Workshops with the Ultra burrs exclusively for filter coffee. Espresso with the Core burrs also tastes great to me. However, I’m looking for a good second grinder dedicated to daily espresso, as I don’t want to switch out the burrs in the EG1 every day. Besides, I’m not particularly a fan of the taste profile with the Ultra burrs for espresso.

Now, the question is: in your opinion, what would be the perfect end-game grinder to complement this setup?

I’ve been considering a conical grinder, such as The Key. I mainly drink medium to sometimes darker roasts, with light roasts being quite rare. That’s why I’ve been leaning towards a conical burr grinder. What’s your take on this?

An alternative could be the Niche, but it’s not particularly appealing to me visually. What other options would you recommend?

Thanks in advance for your tips!

1ha9kkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Songstuff/comments/1ha9kkl/inside_the_beautiful_chaos_what_it_truly_means_to/,"**""Inside the Beautiful Chaos: What It Truly Means to Be an Independent Artist 🌟""**","**The Beautiful Chaos of Being an Independent Artist 🌟**

Alright, let’s talk about something close to our hearts—being an independent artist. The grind, the passion, the freedom, and the NEVER-ENDING CHAOS. Whether you're a bedroom producer creating beats until 3 a.m. or a vocalist recording takes in someone’s basement, you’re in the trenches of creativity. But let’s be real—it’s equal parts exhilarating and exhausting.

Here’s the thing about being independent: **you’re ALL the departments.** You’re the artist, the marketer, the manager, the accountant, the promoter, and the coffee runner all in one. Actually, scratch that. You don’t even have time for coffee runs—just chug that cold brew you forgot in the fridge last night and hope for the best.  

But in the midst of all this madness, there’s something magical about the journey. Let’s break it down.  

---

## 🎤 The Challenges We Know Too Well
- **Money, money, money (or lack of it).** Studio time? Expensive. Gear? EXPENSIVE. Marketing? What’s a budget again? You’re basically trying to pull off industry-level work with whatever rolls in from Bandcamp sales and maybe a part-time job. (Shout-out to everyone who’s learned to DIY their merch.)  
- **Visibility struggle is real.** You're out here pouring your soul into your art, but somehow that TikTok remix of a guy gargling toothpaste is pulling in millions of views. There’s no playbook, no big budget campaign giving you a boost. If people stumble across you, it’s probably down to a mix of your persistence and cosmic luck.  
- **Time is a scam?!** Between creating, networking, uploading, and generally hustling, when does one sleep? (Hint: they don’t.) It can feel like you’re always spinning plates, and one drop might cost you everything.

---

## 🌟 Why We Stick It Out Anyway
But let’s be honest—there’s *something* that keeps us all coming back. It's more than just wanting to blow up on Spotify.  

- **Authenticity is EVERYTHING.** You call the shots, always. Wanna drop an album of lo-fi synths mixed with penguin sounds? Go for it. Independent artists don’t play by the rules, and the creative control is something labels can’t buy.  
- **Every win feels like a revolution.** Got a DM from someone halfway across the world saying your lyrics helped them through a tough time? Sold 5 t-shirts? Finished a song after battling your inner perfectionist? Every little victory hits hard—because you worked for it, and it’s 100% yours.  
- **The freedom to experiment.** You’re not checking with A&Rs or executives—your song, your vibe, your call. Want to mix drum & bass with folk vocals? Hey, maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t, but at least *you* got to try.  

---

## 🤝 Supporting Each Other Is EVERYTHING
Here’s a reminder: Just because you're independent doesn’t mean you’re alone. Community changes the game.  

- Let’s uplift each other on platforms like Reddit, local music scenes, and socials. Share your work, connect with producers, collaborate with writers. Teamwork makes the dream work, even when you're indie.  
- Celebrate your wins AND others’. Someone else’s success doesn’t take away from yours. Honestly? It might even expand your circle.  

---

## ✨ A Final Word to the Dreamers  
Being an independent artist is like wandering through a forest without a map—but you’ve got a compass in the form of your creativity and determination. There are thorns, rough terrain, and probably a lot of mosquitoes. But somewhere, on a quiet little hillside, there’s the view you’re chasing.  

Keep creating. Keep pushing. Keep celebrating the art that lights you up and refusing to compromise the heart of who you are. You’re building something—whether it’s playlists with 50 listeners, a gig with 20 people, or a song you literally just made to distract yourself from life for a bit. And that? It matters more than you know.

And they're 40p more than caffeinated ones! Bit of triv for you: to make decaf, you need to get regular tea and remove the caffeine; I always assumed it was a different plant strain or something (but looked it up when I noticed they're more, so I don't mind as much). 

Anyway, it gets to about 8pm and I'm straight in making one with a mince pie as a little treat to myself and the sandman doesn't care! 

Do you know what else? On Saturday I was having a quiet night in, did this routine, but then had ANOTHER at 10pm with a wagon wheel too! Absolute madness on the edge. I can drink as many as I like, I've gone drunk on tea power! 

May your evening brew be merry!

1ha9gss,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ha9gss/i_am_struggling_with_emotional_unavailability_in/,I am struggling with emotional unavailability in dating,"TLDR; I have a pattern of emotionally unavailable behaviour in dating and thought I was past it. I am not, but now someone who is emotionally available to me is involved and I don’t want to hurt him. How do I bring this up to him without hurting him? Should I ask him to just be friends while I work to figure things out?

I’ve always struggled with dating. Never did it in high school, when I got to college I tried a couple apps here and there, but nothing more than a date with someone before I pretty much blew them off. During the pandemic, my mental health took a huge hit but I got therapy and bounced back from it. In the last couple of years, I can honestly say that I’ve grown to be more loving and caring towards myself, and this is probably the best my mental health has ever been. I thought maybe I was possibly ready to try dating again. 

Any time I tried before, it would usually go something like this. Start by talking with them over text a lot, trying to get to know each other a bit more on a surface level. Plan a date for coffee (low-stakes, easy to actually talk). Go to the date being nervous as all hell. Not vibe very well with things. Get home being extremely drained. Move on and not talk to them anymore (sometimes I get to a second or third date, but very rarely). I’ve become more aware of this pattern, and I don’t want to follow it again. It’s emotionally exhausting since I struggle with divulging personal things to anyone and I’m aware that keeping things bottled up is also not healthy. 

A couple months ago, I met Jamie. It started off the same way, texting a bunch. We planned a date but it kept getting postponed (I got really sick, he went on a trip for work, I got sick again). We went out a couple of weeks ago, and it was good. For the most part, conversation was light and was more getting-to-know-you stuff. Close to the end, he started to open up emotionally in terms of where he possibly saw things going for us. I honestly felt extremely anxious, had to force any words to come out of myself. I did say I needed things to be taken slow on all fronts, which he said was fine by him. 

On my way home, my feelings were honestly all over the place; on one hand, I did want to see where things went with him as he expressed, but on the other hand, this familiar pit in my stomach wouldn’t go away. I know that pit all too well, and I told myself that it was just anxiety and that this would blow over and it’d be fine. I mean, this is low-stakes since we are still getting to know each other, right? 

We have gone out a couple more times since. Jamie has been really patient with me so far, checking in with where I’m at in terms of comfort and any issues I might have. For the most part, I’ve found myself just smiling and nodding. I like spending time with him, but the pit just keeps growing. I know that at this rate it might swallow me whole. But Jamie has been so sweet, and he’s been hurt in relationships before, I don’t want him to get swallowed up either. I want to break this cycle, but I don’t know how to do it. 

All of the online resources I find do recommend therapy, which I’ll see if I can access it, though it might not be feasible financially so it’s not even guaranteed I’ll be able to do it. But in the meantime, what do I say to Jamie? Should I tell him I need to take a step back from our relationship as a romantic one, instead having us just be friends? What would be the best course of action here?

I don't confidently remember the outcome of any battles before Ward and J2. There were some undercard battles and then coffee vs. Bailey. I'm not sure about the outcome of those, so forgive me.


Award 30'd J2. You can maybe debate the 2nd. Yall know I don't like Award, so it pains me to say this. He was dope this battle, though. 


Will 2-0. Very disappointing battle. Both of them choked in the first, hence why I only scored 2 rounds. Bill was okay in his 2nd and very shakey in the 3rd. Will was bombing in his 2nd, though great round.


Roc 2-1 edge. Marv got the first kinda comfortable. Round 2 I gave Roc. 3rd I edged roc but this battle was debatable lowkey. You could say Marv 1st and 3rd. Roc is not COTY, btw.


Rex 30. Qleen should've just no showed. He choked/stumbled every round. Don't let that take away from this being a great Rex performance, especially the first 2 rounds. It's not quite chilla level, but def up there. 


Cal and Swamp was a pretty good back and forth. They were gassing cal, but that's expected. I need to watch this battle again, but I think I scored it 2-1 Swamp. Don't hold me to this one. I'm pretty sure Swamp got the 1st and 3rd, though. Had cal pretty comfy in the 2nd. 


Mook 2-1 Clear debatable Gents 30. Ars might've taken the first, but the other 2 rounds are clear for Mook. Ars 3rd was cringe. This was maybe the best Mook I've seen. It feels like Mook is getting better low-key. Sober Mook is a different animal. Hitman doesn't want any parts fr. Tbh, the way Mook was rapping reminded me of Daylyt in the Roc battle. Every word mattered.

How do you know you're done?,"I have not written anything to completion in over ten years, and those were short, one-off creative writing assignments with no planning or outlining involved.

I recently started trying to write again because I have a few concepts that mean a hell of a lot to me personally, and even if it's never published, I want to finish them for myself and maybe bind them to have them on my coffee table (of course who wouldn't want to get published if people enjoy it, but I want to do this either way).

The number one piece of advice here seems to be: **just write**.  Do it.  Get words down.

But in my case, I don't feel like I'm ready.  I don't have a finished outline.  I have my message, I have my main character, I know what sorts of conflicts I want him to have, and I have an idea of where I want him to end up.  But the story is evolving every time I sit down and manage to get my thoughts out.  I use Scrivener and have pages and pages of planning about themes and subtext and how this story will connect to others (it's an anthology series, sort of).  So I've written a lot and most of it is relevant to what I will be writing, but it feels like the skeleton isn't there. 

Do you ever get to a finished outline without starting to draft?  I forced myself to ""pants"" a few weeka ago and I guess I enjoyed what I wrote, but it went off the rails into something I can't use for my story.  I felt like I had no compass at all.

I see this in my head but it's scattered and I don't know how to make it more concise.

To be clear, I am aware I have no idea what I'm doing but I am trying to learn.  I've been watching a lot of storytelling and novel writing channels including Sanderson's videos.  I have stockpiled a whole hoard of books and got myself some fancy note cards, high lighters, and pens so I can practice some information retention and note-taking methods to help me learn and absorb.  I know this is going to take a beginner a long time.   But I feel aimless a lot of the time and was wondering how other people deal with planning.  Maybe someone else's approach might help me approach my own.

1ha97og,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ha97og/nerve_pain_and_muscle_spasm_severity/,Nerve pain and muscle spasm severity.,"Hi everyone, I'm about a month in to a cold turkey quit, 10 years heavy coffee drinker. I am starting to become concerned I'm not just experiencing coffee withdrawl. The nerve pain and muscle spasms have gotten pretty bad. I felt pretty good for a week until last Monday when another round of symptoms showed up through the entire week. Last night was almost unbearable. I had aches and pains all over my body, tingling and burning sensations. It always starts to get bad around 5-6pm and lets up in the morning or at least lessens.

Is this a normal experience? Is there somewhere else I can go to see other people's experiences with withdrawl? I don't want to panic and start throwing money at ghosts if this is just from coffee. Thanks.",2,1733749326.0,decaf,5,1.0,False

1ha96xh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1ha96xh/adhd_chronic_dehydration/,ADHD / chronic dehydration,"Hi, for as long as I can remember I have had all the symptoms of ADHD. Also, for as long as I can remember I have never felt thirsty, drinking 2-3 cups of coffee a day, maybe a cup of tea and a glass of wine in the evening purely for enjoyment, not because my body was telling me it needed liquid. I would go out running with friends and force half a glass of water down me afterwards, purely because I knew I should, not because my body was telling me I had just ran 5 miles and now i required water. The other half of the glass of water would get discarded. 

About 2 years ago I researched into ADHD and ticked off the list of symptoms, forgetful, daydreaming, difficulty paying attention, avoidance of tasks requiring attention, excessive talking, disorganization, unable to follow instructions... the list goes on. I felt for sure, this is me, this explains the years of me not being able to achieve what I want to achieve, being disorganized despite my best efforts, having no energy but then sudden bursts of energy that end in a half completed project. Along with all of these symptoms came crippling migraines. I put these down to hormones mixed with lack of sleep. Some nights I would really struggle to sleep, this would inevitably lead to a migraine, as would the week following my period.

After a week of the flu (possibly covid) which triggered a 5 day migraine, a weeks rest and then another 3 day migraine I tasked myself with drinking more fluids. As I only really enjoy coffee and wine, water I will easily put down and never pick back up again, I purchased fruity herbal tea. Replacing the routine of going to the kettle to make a coffee with going to the kettle and making a herbal tea was an easier adjustment. Plus drinking something warm tricked my brain into thinking ""hot fluid, must consume all of it"".

Now my brain feels super powered. I have just completed a practice exam question that I was stuck on for 2 days prior to the increased fluid intake. I have completed jobs around the house that I would previously got half way through and inevitably got distracted and left. 

This has me pondering the ADHD question. Increasingly more and more people are self diagnosing with ADHD, myself included. I have read on a number of forums that not being thirsty or forgetting to drink is a symptom of ADHD... maybe not being thirsty is a symptom of something entirely different. Maybe some people just don't have that link in their brain that says ""you are thirsty, drink something"". Maybe some people do and they choose coffee or tea or alcohol which essentially also leads to dehydration. Dehydration then leads to ADHD type symptoms. Then instead of tackling the route issue (dehydration) people are saying well I must have ADHD and then living with the repercussions of being chronically dehydrated because they believe it is a ND disorder. 

Im not saying that ADHD is not real. What I'm saying is that maybe the massive increase in ADHD self and maybe even clinically diagnosed people is the fact that some of these people are chronically dehydrated which in itself may cause symptoms similar to actual ADHD. And that if anyone that believes they do have it, if they also have the lack of ability to feel thirsty or regularly just consume dehydrating fluids such as coffee... maybe ... just maybe tackle the dehydration to see if your symptoms improve. 



If you have read this far, thank you. This may just be rambling. But I for one have undiagnosed myself with ADHD. And I am going to try to focus on remaining hydrated, even though I don't ever feel thirsty. I will keep reminding myself of how much better I feel when I have increased my fluid intake. Maybe in a few months I will take it all back and say no, Im still as disorganised as ever and have no ability to focus... but Ive just typed this solidly for half an hour so fingers crossed.

Thanks

One of our favorites is using copper antennas for electroculture. By harnessing natural energy, these antennas help plants grow healthier and faster without needing chemicals or fertilizers.



Another simple but effective hack is DIY drip irrigation. Using old water bottles with small holes poked in them near your plant roots can keep your garden hydrated without wasting water.



We also reuse kitchen scraps like eggshells and coffee grounds, which add valuable nutrients to the soil. And don’t forget the power of mulch! A good layer can help control weeds and keep moisture in the soil, saving time and effort in your garden.



Lastly, companion planting is a great way to protect your plants naturally. Pairing things like tomatoes and basil can help with pest control and even boost the flavor of your crops.



These are just a few of the tricks we’ve learned along the way. What are some of your favorite gardening hacks? Let’s share and learn together!",1,1733749135.0,EcoGardeningHub,0,1.0,False
1ha952n,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1ha952n/he_didnt_want_anything_serious_but_was_still/,He didn’t want anything serious but was still interested in getting to know me… I am so confused ,"Hey everyone. I am having boy troubles that I need help working through. I have been crushing on this guy for about a month and a half and finally decided to shoot my shot this past weekend. I asked him out for coffee and got his number and we texted for the better part of Saturday. During that texting session, though, he told me that he wasn’t looking for anything serious, which, if I may be honest, was completely gut wrenching. I told him that I wasn’t exactly interested in starting a relationship quickly, but I am trying to make deeper connections with intention to have a more serious relationship. He said he would need time for someone more serious, which is absolutely understandable. But he did mention that he would still like to take me out and that he was interested in getting to know me more, so we continued talking until Saturday night. Mind you, we haven’t made any plans to meet yet, and I’m not sure if I should initiate that or if I should wait for him to…

On Sunday, there was no communication, which makes sense, I mean, he could have been busy, though, it did make me quite anxious (I have had past experiences where men seemed to be interested, then ghosted me not long after the first date… and it created a bit of sensitivity for me) 

I didn’t reach out to him because I feel like I have been making all of the first moves, approaching him, asking for his number, texting first… I wanted to see if maybe he might initiate something, but it’s been complete radio silence (it’s currently Monday morning, still early and under the 48 hour mark) 

I am just feeling confused, anxious, and a bit sensitive about the whole situation because I don’t want to come off as desperate or DTF, but I also don’t want him to think I’ve lost interest, but also, I don’t actually know if he has lost interest or not. To be honest, I wish I could just shut off my emotions like the vampires do in TVD, because I feel really lost and it’s starting to affect my mental state. Am I overreacting? Or is there some legitimacy to my anxieties? Please be kind, but also let me know your thoughts.

TLDR: shot my shot, we texted, he said he wasn’t looking for anything serious, I told him I am dating with intention and he wanted to still take me out and get to know me (no plans made yet) no communication since Saturday night (it’s Monday morning) am I overreacting or not?

1ha93uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/piscesastrology/comments/1ha93uq/pisces_09031992_lostwhat_my_chart_is_about/,Pisces 09-03-1992 lost/what my chart is about?,"Hi all,

I’m 32 and feeling pretty lost in life. I’ve always been a never-ending dreamer, constantly seeking perfection.  
As a child, I had immense anxiety around people. I would hide because I couldn’t handle the emotions and energy inside me. But, as a true Pisces, no one could really see my anxiety. Maybe when I was a kid, because I was super quiet. I just knew something wasn’t right, and even back then, I understood I had to fight through it.  
Because of this, even my parents and those closest to me never realized how scared I felt inside. Instead, I always received feedback that I seemed super confident. I would fight against 5 men even if I would be dead, I hate to be scared of something. Strangely, I’ve always attracted people to me, but I kept my distance from everyone.

Another thing I’ve found odd is how people I’ve met randomly, in one-on-one situations, would tell me their deepest life stories and secrets. Afterward, they would often grow attached to me, but I would always run away. I liked analyzing their lives—not judging them—but learning from their experiences to try and understand what life is about and give them advice.

When I turned 27, I took a job working with people—about 200 of them at a hotel. I wanted to challenge myself, to confront my fears head-on. Unfortunately, it became overwhelming, and I turned to alcohol. I drank for a year, all day, every day. I remember having about eight liters of empty vodka bottles after just one week.  
Eventually, I replaced alcohol with weed, but for the past four years, I’ve spent €800-€1,200 monthly on it.

Now, I’m on my third day without weed. I’ve tried to stop many times before, but I feel like this is it—I just can’t carry this burden anymore. I’m exhausted from life.

Growing up, I never had a girlfriend until I was 26. I only had sex with prostitutes, even though my female classmates would ask me out at night or drop hints like, *“I’m waiting for you to invite me for coffee.”* I was too scared to open up. I even got asked if I was gay  few times because of how distant I was! Eventually, I slept with a few hundred prostitutes before finally having my first honest relationship. It helped me realize I’m “normal” and capable of being accepted by someone.

Between 27 and 31, I had my first two loves. One even lived with me, but I was never satisfied. I was constantly seeking perfection.

My last girlfriend, a Capricorn born on January 10, 1996, was an intense and beautiful experience. We had eight amazing months full of love. But then, I started having those same crazy thoughts—that I could find someone better, or that I wanted to enjoy life and travel. After some verbal fights, I shut myself off, smoked even more, and slowly pushed her away.  
A year later, this past Friday, we met again, just for sex. We ended up spending three days together, talking until 4 a.m. I’m slowly realizing that my unhappiness comes from within, and I’ve been projecting it outward, constantly chasing perfection. This girl is 150% behind me, helping me quit my addiction. She has a strong character, which I deeply admire, and it hurts to think about what I’ve done to someone who would do anything for me.

At this moment, I’m €12,000 in debt, having lost €100,000 in investments. I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom and have no strength left to live like this anymore.

I’ve gone through so much pain in my life. I lost my health at 18 due to an autoimmune disease and had to endure 10 surgeries. It’s been years and years of pain and discomfort. I spent those years studying nutrition, the body, and exercise. I experimented on myself to regain my health, and after 12 years, I finally got my sense of smell back. Somehow, I’m still here, and my immune system is better than it was 15 years ago.

Through all this pain, dreaming, and analyzing, I’ve gone from being an atheist to fully believing in God and Jesus in recent months. Too many coincidences have happened, and now I don’t just believe—I *know.* It’s hard to explain, but it feels undeniable.

I never believed in astrology or the people who tried to tell me about myself through it. But this year, when I read about Pisces, I saw myself more clearly than ever before. For the first time, I understood that I’m not crazy—just a Pisces and crying.

We're entering day 4 from coming home from the hospital. We've had guests all day and LO is awake during the night and asleep during the day. I don't want to upset my wife as she's having a rough go of recovery so I volunteer every night to stay up with him. I haven't slept more than 8 hours since we got home. Last night I feel asleep holding him in the chair for an hour and a half. My wife then said she was worried about safety and that I might hurt myself or LO. I handle everything house and do LOs diapers and burping to lessen the strain on my wife. I'm now drinking pots of coffee at a time and taking caffeine pills. Tonight in the chair I had a cup of coffee in hand and while half falling asleep my hand gave out and the coffee went in the LOs lap. Her seems fine. The swaddle caught most of it and I had him undressed before anything bad happened. But it's just another strike while at bat. Diapers are terrible, he hoses me down almost every change.I try a cold wipe to get him started which works, but the change turns into a screaming kick boxing match.

1ha8x8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ha8x8r/help_reconnecting_with_my_brother_now_that_hes/,Help reconnecting with my brother now that he’s out from under nMom (maybe),"I’ll eventually try and unpack specific instances of abuse here, but for the sake of this post, just take it as given I grew up with a stereotypical nMom… pick 5 nMom posts from this sub and you basically know me.  The issue…

My bio parents divorced when I (44m) was 14 (nMom cheated) and when I was 16 she had my half-brother with her second husband.  We weren’t really in a financial position to make it easy, so my younger full-brother (m41 now) had to share a room and we both got deputized voluntold caregivers.  Needless to say this put a strain on the relationships with both brothers.  New brother got all the attention and consideration… example: my mother got rid of my cat one day while I was at school (which I loved, it was my only safe space) … saying it wasn’t healthy to have a cat in the house while she was as pregnant.  And so on and so on… it’s fair to say 16 year old me resented hi a LOT.  And my relationship with my full-brother suffered because of being forced into proximity.  Plus she’d play us off each other… getting my brother to snoop through my stuff so she could say “well it’s HIS room too.. I didn’t snoop”.  

Anyways… I left for Uni far away as soon as I could.  I’d come back to visit on holidays and in the summer for the first year or so… but soon I was using study or work to skip family stuff.  I’d never have enough time to visit everyone when I came back, and if I spent more than one day visiting my Dads side my mom would throw tantrums… it just became an obligation, there was no joy and it and it strained my already tight budget to travel.  Once I was out of Uni I went back even less.  So needless to say I never really had a relationship with my half-brother when he was young… he got engaged right before the pandemic and put their wedding on indefinite hold.    He was in my wedding party 10 years ago… mostly out of obligation, both me and my wife had our siblings as our party.  I don’t hate him, in fact I wish him all the best, but we just don’t have any kind of relationship.  

This summer shit apparently hit the fan in a MASSIVE way… he got married… I wasn’t invited and no one told me about it.  I also found out through the grape vine that a week before his wedding my nMom announced that she was leaving her third husband (brother was with husband 2) and was moving back to the butt-fuck nowhere town she grew up in (and hates more than anything this world) to be with a highschool crush she’d been in contact with for a year.  This has been her MO her whole life… I think she’s been single for MAYBE a month total since she was 18… she goes from husband to boyfriend to husband to another husband… always lining the next one up weeks or months ahead of time and literally moving out from one and into another.  She’s now mid sixties btw.  But for some reason insisted on bring her now latest ex-husband to the wedding anyways… his own kids didn’t even know and found out at the wedding.

My initial reaction was to be hurt about not being invited…  I know we’re not close, but he was at my wedding and nothing good or bad has happened between us since.  But I took a second and realized it was his wedding, his choice… and I remember hating how much of my own wedding was obligation and not choice.  Weddings are expensive so at the end of the day if me not going meant he could invite someone he actually wanted there… great.  I also realized that with my mother kinda out of the picture (she moved across the province, 18 hours away I might actually be able to have a relationship with my brother.  My mom basically used everyone as spies whether they realized or not and bad mouthed me constantly to everyone.  So I find it extremely hard to trust ANYONE In my mom’s orbit.  

I sent him a congratulations message about a week after the wedding as soon as I found out and he responded saying thanks and that he hoped I understood as I haven’t really been a part of his life and that it hurt that his oldest brother basically abandoned him.  I told him I completely understand, no hard feelings and I don’t blame him one bit for not inviting me and for how he feels toward me.  We chatted a bit and ended up making very tentative plans to grab a coffee next time I’m in town… maybe at Xmas.

So here’s the rub… I have no idea how deep my mother’s claws are sunk into him and how much of her alternate facts he believes.  It SEEMS that they have a pretty decent relationship… his partner seems to get along with her…. And if we do talk I want to make it about US not her… but how do I explain my side of things without that context?  If they do have a relationship he’s happy with I don’t want to get in the way of that… but if that’s the case it makes it that much harder to trust him… I also don’t want this to become further ammo against me “why are you filling your brothers head with lies… why are you trying to turn him against me”.  I’ve basically become isolated from her entire side of the family… they’re all very don’t rock the boat… don’t make a fuss, can’t we all just turn a blind eye and be nice.  Not kind… nice.  So in the decades of issues with my mom they’ve never once reached out to me… to get my side of the story or even just see if I was OK.  I have to assume they either believe my mother’s reality or they just don’t care enough to intervene.. family matters are family matters, it’s none of our business and/or I’m not putting myself in the line of fire.

I know I’m partially to blame for basically tapping out not building a relationship with him… he was an innocent casualty of my relationship with my mom… I feel terribly guilty about it all the time, but I just don’t know how to go about fixing things without jeopardizing the peace I’ve built being almost no-contact with my mother.  Bring him into my life opens doors for my mom to weasel her way back in.  Help?

1ha8wtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teethgumhealth/comments/1ha8wtf/teeth_whitening_before_and_after/,Teeth Whitening Before And After,"The Impact of Teeth Whitening Before and After: Real Results and Expectations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many people dream of a brighter, whiter smile. Teeth whitening has become a popular cosmetic procedure that promises to enhance your appearance and boost your confidence. But what can you realistically expect when it comes to teeth whitening before and after treatments? Let's explore the impact of teeth whitening, the results you can achieve, and how to manage your expectations.

### Understanding Teeth Whitening

Teeth whitening is a cosmetic process that removes stains and discoloration from your teeth. It can be done at home with kits or in professional dental offices. The most common whitening agents are hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. These agents work by breaking down the stains on the teeth, resulting in a whiter appearance.

### Teeth Whitening Before: What to Expect

Before undergoing whitening treatments, it's essential to have a clear understanding of your dental health. Here are a few points to consider:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Dentist Consultation:** Schedule an appointment with your dentist to evaluate your teeth and gums. This helps determine if you’re a good candidate for whitening.
- **Type of Stains:** Identify the type of stains you have. Yellow stains tend to respond better to whitening than brown or gray hues.
- **Expectations:** Discuss your goals with your dentist. Having realistic expectations will help you feel satisfied with the results.
- **Before Photos:** Take photos of your teeth before the treatment for comparison later. This can help visualize the improvements.

### Teeth Whitening After: The Results

The results of teeth whitening can be quite impressive. After completing the treatment, many individuals see noticeable improvements in the shade of their teeth. This can lead to greater self-confidence and motivation to maintain oral hygiene. Here are some of the key outcomes to expect:

- **Whiter Smile:** Most people achieve a brighter smile, often several shades lighter than before.
- **Improved Oral Health:** Many find themselves more inclined to care for their teeth post-treatment, as they want to maintain their new smile.
- **Lasting Results:** With proper care, including regular dental cleanings and good oral hygiene, your results can last for a year or more.

### Things to Keep in Mind

While the benefits of teeth whitening are undeniable, it’s also crucial to be aware of some common side effects and limitations:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Sensitivity:** Some individuals experience tooth sensitivity after whitening. This discomfort is usually temporary.
- **Not for Everyone:** If you have dental work like crowns or fillings, whitening may not affect these restorations.
- **Overuse:** Excessive whitening can damage your enamel, leading to more severe issues. Stick to recommended usage.

### Aftercare for Teeth Whitening

To ensure the longevity of your results, consider these aftercare tips:

- **Avoid Stain-Causing Foods:** Limit beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine for at least 48 hours post-treatment.
- **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush and floss regularly to keep your smile bright and healthy.
- **Use Touch-Up Kits:** Many find it helpful to use touch-up whitening products every few months to maintain their brightness.

### Teeth Whitening Options

When considering your options for teeth whitening, be aware that there are different methods available:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Whitening:** Fast and effective, done by a professional. Results can be seen in a single visit.
- **At-Home Kits:** Convenient but may take longer to show results. They are generally less potent than professional treatments.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Good for maintenance but may not be effective for significant stains.

Ultimately, the journey of teeth whitening before and after can be transformative. By setting proper expectations and understanding both the risks and results, you can enjoy a brighter smile with confidence. Always consult with your dentist to find the best solution for you, ensuring your whitening experience is both effective and safe.

Different Teeth Whitening Methods: Which One Gives the Best Results?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic procedure that people pursue for various reasons, including enhancing their smile and boosting their confidence. With numerous options available, it's essential to understand the different teeth whitening methods, their effectiveness, and the results they can produce. Let’s explore these methods to help you decide which one might be the best fit for your needs.

### In-Office Whitening Treatments

Professional treatments at a dentist's office are one of the fastest methods for achieving a brighter smile. These procedures usually include the application of a high-concentration bleaching agent along with a special light or laser that enhances the whitening process. Many patients notice significant results in just one session.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Speed:** Results are often seen immediately after just one appointment.
- **Effectiveness:** Typically provides the most dramatic results, especially for deep stains.
- **Customizable:** Dentists can tailor the treatment according to specific dental needs.

### At-Home Whitening Kits

For those who prefer to whiten their teeth in the comfort of their home, at-home whitening kits are a popular choice. Many of these kits include whitening trays and gels that you wear for a specified period, usually over several days or weeks.

- **Convenience:** Flexible application times fit into your schedule.
- **Affordability:** Generally, these kits are less expensive than in-office treatments.
- **Variety:** Various products are available, including strips, trays, and brush-on gels.

### Whitening Toothpaste

Whitening toothpaste is an easy way to maintain or slightly improve your tooth color as part of your daily oral hygiene. While it can help remove surface stains, it's important to note that it usually doesn't affect the intrinsic color of your teeth.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Accessibility:** Easy to find in any grocery or pharmacy.
- **Low Risk:** It's a safe option that can be used daily without significant side effects.
- **Maintenance:** Best for sustaining results after a more intensive whitening treatment.

### Natural Remedies

Some individuals prefer to explore natural teeth whitening methods, such as baking soda, activated charcoal, or oil pulling. While these methods may show some whitening effects, results can vary widely, and they are often less effective than commercial products.

- **Cost-Effective:** Many natural ingredients are readily available in your kitchen.
- **Fewer Chemicals:** Beneficial for those looking to avoid synthetic whitening agents.
- **Gentle Approach:** While generally safe, these methods often require persistence for noticeable changes.

### Comparison of Methods

When considering teeth whitening, it’s essential to evaluate not just the results but also the process and maintenance required. Here’s a comparison of the major methods:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Whitening** - Quick and effective but more expensive.
- **At-Home Kits** - Affordable with variable results; requires effort and time.
- **Whitening Toothpaste** - Subtle results and great for maintenance but not significant for whitening alone.
- **Natural Remedies** - Safe and economical but usually less effective.

### Choosing the Right Method

Choosing the best teeth whitening method depends on several factors:

- **Your Budget:** In-office treatments can be pricey, while at-home kits and toothpaste are more budget-friendly.
- **Your Time Frame:** If you need results quickly, professional treatments might be your best bet.
- **Your Preferences:** Some might prefer natural options, while others seek immediate and dramatic changes.

Ultimately, understanding the variety of teeth whitening methods can empower you to make an informed choice that aligns with your goals for a brighter smile. It's essential to consult with your dentist to determine the best path for your dental health and aesthetic aspirations. With the right approach, you can achieve that dazzling smile you’ve always wanted!

### Conclusion

Achieving a brighter smile through teeth whitening can significantly boost your confidence and enhance your overall appearance. As we've explored, the impact of teeth whitening before and after can be quite remarkable, allowing individuals to see a noticeable difference that aligns with their expectations. However, it’s crucial to approach this journey with realistic goals, understanding that individual results may vary based on factors like tooth sensitivity and the original shade of your teeth.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
When considering different teeth whitening methods, it’s clear there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. From professional in-office treatments to at-home kits and natural remedies, each option has its own set of advantages and challenges. Professional whitening often offers the most dramatic results, but some may find over-the-counter solutions or natural methods more accessible and effective over time.

Ultimately, the best results come from a thoughtful choice of method, tailored to your specific needs. Remember to follow all instructions carefully, and consult with a dental professional if you have any concerns. With the right approach to teeth whitening, you can achieve a dazzling smile that not only meets your expectations but leaves you feeling proud and self-assured every time you show those pearly whites. Brightening your smile is a fulfilling journey, one that celebrates your uniqueness and enhances your self-image in ways that go beyond appearances.

**FNBS**

Raven Maddox: I think what’s intriguing is that a look into Jane Allgood’s proposed security plan for America, should she win the presidency this coming Tuesday, presents us with a shroud of secrecy and unanswered questions. First and foremost, what does the implementation of the Third Eye surveillance system mean for our lives? And should we be concerned that Nosticorp, the corporation behind Third Eye, will effectively become another department in the executive branch of the government? Is it Constitutional?

Joining me today from MIT is a young man who wears many hats: child prodigy, professor of Artificial Intelligence, high-tech guru, and now an activist and vocal critic of what the Third Eye bill is proposing. I’m happy to bring you Peter Kim. Peter, welcome. Thank you for coming.

Peter Kim: My pleasure. It’s good to see you again, Raven.

Raven Maddox: Professor Kim, I’m not anywhere near an expert on computers. I can barely get my car to sync with the automated driving networks. How do you explain to me, and people like me, what this bill means and why you’re concerned about it?

Peter Kim: Well, Raven, the easy part is the artificial intelligence. The world has been using AI for roughly a hundred years now, and more recently in the sense of true Artificial Super Intelligence. AI is an ingrained facet of society, most notably in self-driving cars and other automated applications and industries. We’ve had some road bumps along the way, but since the grid was installed, deaths by automobile accidents have pretty much been eliminated. But what this SP legislation wants to do is introduce Third Eye into the arteries of the internet. This will mostly be felt as an effect called “integration.”

Raven Maddox: Integration. Yes, this buzzword has been trending. What exactly is *integration* in this context?

Peter Kim: Since Third Eye is true ASI, let’s think of it as a living thing, like a virus. At some point it will be initiated from a source server inside the Nosticorp complex and start infecting technology from there.

Raven Maddox: Do we have a choice whether or not to download this… thing?

Peter Kim: No, we will not have that choice. Third Eye will start to explore places to inhabit, starting with your phone, your car, even your refrigerator. The things those computer scientists are doing over there is game changing. Yes, I can see the positive implications for national security, but the negative side effects are all too real.

The technology-atrocity hypothesis argues that major advancements in technology are often accompanied by an increase in the scale or severity of human atrocities. For example, the Holocaust. The systematic genocide of six million Jews by the Nazis could not have been carried out without the advancements in transportation, telecommunications, and data processing brought about by the industrial revolution.

Raven Maddox: Or weapons of mass destruction.

Peter Kim: Yes. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the Second World War. Or, thirteen years ago, the bomb dropped during the Battle of Tbilisi.

Raven Maddox: On the other hand, presidential candidate Jane Allgood says America needs to catch up with technology, that Third Eye is what we need in our society to defeat terror and get us back on the cutting edge so that we can survive as a nation.

Peter Kim: I think we should be suspicious of this kind of rhetoric, and we need to require transparency. Nobody really knows what will happen once the integration begins. Nosticorp is a very secretive company, and they do not allow anyone to study the code or the alignment philosophy with which Third Eye was created. If this is going to be imposed on the American people, we need to demand transparency.

Raven Maddox: Peter Kim, I’m not sure, but I think I understand better now. Thank you for your time. I believe we’ll need your expertise as things move forward. You’re always welcome back.

Stay tuned, because coming up next, we have a guest who says the mega hit series *Eternal Love* is actually indoctrinating children into the occult. That should be interesting. Stay tuned.

Clear Hope Mental Wellness Clinic

*Everyone Deserves Peace of Mind*

The sign hung large and gaudy off the stone façade of Paul Murphy’s labor of love. Alan got out of his car and set the warm McDonald’s sack on the hood. He had five minutes, so he lit a cigarette. The snow hadn’t stuck in the humid environment of the lakeside town, but the cement was wet, and there was a chill in the air that smelled fresh off the water.

The clinic occupied prime real estate above Riverside Park. It was Murphy’s philosophy that the mentally ill should be able to take a short walk and settle their troubled minds on the natural beauty offered by Montana.

Like one of the patients, Flathead River seemed sad and deflated in the cockcrow of morning. The stony beach ran out farther than the dock, and the waters were melancholic, somewhere between daphne and gravestone gray. A man in a black jacket loitered down by the swings; a junkie, no doubt a spinner, a drifter, a refugee, a shadow.

He flicked his cigarette into the street, grabbed the cooling bag, and punched his access code into the front door. The lobby was empty and silent. He went to a large set of double doors, entered his access code again, and walked down the echoing linoleum to the high-security area in the back that housed D-Pad.

Clear Hope was a joint operation between the benevolence of Dr. Paul Murphy and the State of Montana’s Health and Human Services Department, providing mental health services to residents of Lake County who could not afford them otherwise. Part of that service was to work with juvenile offenders when the need arose, which was why Francis Builds A Fire was here.

“Hi, Sam.”

“Morning, Dr. Smith.” The large Black bodybuilder had his feet up on the reception desk. He was deeply engrossed in something happening in the reality of his glasses.

“How’s our guest?”

“Quiet as a church mouse on Sunday. But I don’t think he slept at all. He’s been sitting in the middle of the floor like that most of the night.” Sam pointed to the computer monitor on the desk. It showed a video feed of D-Pad and a hoodie-clad figure sitting cross-legged on the floor with his back to the soft wall. “Around 3 AM, he started talking to himself. I couldn’t make out what he was saying. That lasted an hour. He’s been quiet ever since, just sitting there like that.”

“Why’s he in D-Pad and not a normal room?” Alan asked.

“It was Dr. Murphy’s orders. He told me to keep a close eye on him.”

“Any suicidal ideation?”

“None,” said Sam.

“Okay. I’m going to go in and see if he wants to talk.”

“Yes, sir. I’ll monitor from here in case you need anything. Cameras and microphones are recording.”

Alan approached the heavy, glass door to see the boy exactly as he had been on the monitor. *Bzzt*. The door automatically unlocked. He slid it to the side and stepped into the room. A faint odor of unwashed teenager hung in the warm air.

“Good morning. I’m Dr. Smith.”

The boy looked up at him, his left eye so swollen it was almost shut. He briefly focused on Alan and then glanced behind him from wall to wall to ceiling like a scared animal. The movement reminded him of the rabbits his sister used to raise for 4H—creatures destined for the chopping block. His bottom lip was cut and swollen, and the right side of his face was a massive bruise of purple and yellow. Mac Winesworth had really done a number on him.

For thirteen, the boy was small. He had a shag of black hair that protruded from his dark green hood and fell across his face past his shoulders. He wore a pair of baggy, gray sweatpants, the clothes he had been wearing when Deputy Wolf picked him up. It didn’t matter. They’d make him change when they arrested him in a few hours. No socks or shoes—D-Pad rules. His feet were small and scuffed with dirt.

“Are you okay?”

“Hello, s-sir,” he said, almost whispering, slouching his shoulders forward in a protective posture. “C-can I g-go h-home now?”

“Hey, buddy. I really want to help get you home, and we’re working on that, but I don’t know what the timeline is.” The boy just stared. Fuck, he knew he sounded fake because that was the way the system wanted him to sound. “My name is Alan Smith. You can call me Alan. What can I call you?”

“F-Francis,” the boy said.

“Okay, Francis. Hey, look here, I got you an Egg McMuffin and some orange juice.” Alan sat down cross-legged and put the bag with the food between them. “I got one too, but the coffee’s for me. Do you drink coffee?”

The boy pushed off his hood and brushed his hair out of his face, causing it to flutter like the mane of a shaggy pony. He fished out a packet of hash browns and took a crunchy bite, chewing carefully.

“There’s ketchup if you want.”

“Thanks. They gave me food last night, but I didn’t eat it.”

“I understand. This place can serve some real crap. There’s no kitchen, so they just do microwave meals. I’ll make sure you get something good for lunch.” Francis nodded and chowed down on his McMuffin. McDonald’s was junk food, but it was delicious and familiar. One of the best ways to strengthen a bruised psyche was with a little culinary comfort. They ate quietly. Francis sipped his OJ, Alan his coffee.

“Francis, we need to talk. The county has asked me to evaluate you to see if you are a threat to yourself. Do you know what that means?” It was a cold question right off the bat but necessary to gauge the boy’s level of maturity.

Francis nodded. “You want to know if I’m gonna kill myself or something.”

“Yeah, basically. And just see how you’re doing. I’m sure this is a frightening experience for you.”

Francis shrugged.

“Before I start asking a bunch of questions, I want you to understand I’m not a police officer, and I’m not a lawyer. I’m just a⁠—”

“A shrink,” Francis said.

Alan laughed. “Yeah. I guess that’s what we’re called. You know why we’re called that?”

The boy shook his head.

“Well, there used to be a tribe of headhunters in the Amazon, the Jivaro. When they killed their enemies, they would cut off their heads and... well, actually, the process is pretty disgusting.”

“Sounds like it,” said Francis. Was that a smile at the corner of a swollen lip?

“The point being, the process of shrinking the head is quite difficult. There’s a relationship there between what the Jivaro did and what psychiatrists do. Anyway, it got popular in the 1950s in Hollywood. Back in the day, going to a shrink was kind of trendy with the movie stars who were known to have huge egos. So they’d go to the headshrinker to get their feelings of self-importance deflated.”

“Interesting. You kind of suck at telling stories, though.” Francis took the last bite of food and gulp of orange juice.

Alan chuckled. He was terrible at telling stories.

“Are you here to see if I have an inflated ego?” Francis asked.

“No. Not really. Being arrested is a traumatic experience for anyone. I want to help you if I can. Maybe all I can do is be someone you can talk to, someone who’s on your side.”

“I don’t think you can help me, Dr. Smith.”

“It’s just Alan.”

“Alan,” said the boy softly.

“Why do you say that?”

“Cause I’m really fucked up.”

“Do you want to talk to me about it? Maybe we can figure things out together.”

Francis pulled his knees up to his chest and hid his face between them.

“Listen, Francis. At some point today, the police are going to come in here and officially arrest you. They will start asking you questions. Tough questions. Whatever you say to them, they are going to use it as evidence against you in court. The county is going to give you a lawyer, and I’m authorized to advise your lawyer based on what we talk about together. So, if there are things you need to say about how you’re feeling and what you’re thinking, you can tell them to me. Maybe I can help your lawyer understand your situation better.”

“I’m scared.”

“I know you are. You know, as a doctor, I have some privileges. Whatever you tell me, I’ll keep it a secret. It’s protected by law, something called doctor-patient confidentiality. That means no one can make me reveal anything you say to me as long as I live.”

“So, I tell you all my secrets, and you won’t say anything?”

“That’s right.”

“What if they set your car on fire?”

“My lips are sealed.”

“What if they take all your money.”

“I don’t have much money. But, still, mum’s the word.”

“What if they arrest you, lock you up, and don’t let you sleep for forty-eight hours?”

“They can’t arrest me. And… torture is illegal. But I wouldn’t say anything just to piss them off at that point. If I counsel you, I swear on my honor, I will not break my oath as a medical professional.”

“And what if I’m crazy?” said the boy. He sucked on his fat lower lip.

“Crazy isn’t a term I like to use. It’s slang. It’s a non-clinical word, like shrink. If you think you can, try to put a little trust in me.”

“Okay, but you’re gonna think I’m fucking crazy.”

“No. No, I won’t.” He wanted to put a reassuring hand on the boy’s shoulder and comfort him, but the rules of medical professionalism prohibited even that small gesture.

Francis looked like he was sizing him up for a foot race. He smiled and winced at the pain. “I’ll trust you, Alan. You can be my shrink.”

“Deal.” Alan held out his fist, and Francis gave him a bump. “I’m going to ask you some questions. All I need you to do is tell me the truth. Can you do that?”

The boy nodded.

“Promise?”

“Promise.” Francis held up his little finger, and Alan hooked it with his own.

“Okay. Where are your parents?”

He shrugged.

“You don’t know where your parents are?”

“Dead, maybe,” he said.

“Why do you say that?”

“White Owl said they were on the spin pretty bad.”

“Is White Owl a relative?”

“No. I live with her… sometimes. She’s a witch.”

“You mean like a medicine woman or a shaman?”

Francis shrugged. “More like a witch.”

“That’s cool. I’m culturally sensitive.”

Francis smiled.

“Is she your guardian then?”

“No, she’s just the only one who would take me… on account of my… issues.” That last word came out with a breath of shame.

“Listen, Francis. I don’t think it’s productive to talk about yourself like that.”

“I’m crazy.” The boy raised his voice. “I say it because it is what it is.”

“Okay, tell me. What makes you so sure you’re crazy?”

Francis buried his head in his legs. Minutes passed until he finally looked at Alan. His lips tried to form a word, but he was mute.

Alan had seen similar behavior before in people who had suffered abuse, usually long, traumatic ordeals at the hands of a family member or caretaker. To speak would be to make real the suffering they had experienced for so long. It meant they would betray their abuser, maybe someone they loved who had hurt them profoundly. Their world would crumble, and they would not know how to pick up the pieces.

“Hey now, Francis.” Alan used a tone of voice he’d learned working with veterans from the eastern front who had experienced the horrors of war; a kind voice but strong, a voice that promised refuge, release, and protection.

The kid peeked from between his arms, shielding his face.

“Francis. I’m here for you. You’re okay. Everything is going to be alright.”

“It will not be alright.” Barely a whisper from deep within a well.

“It will. It will. Tell me who hurt you. I’ll make sure they won’t hurt you anymore.”

“You won’t believe me. You’ll call me crazy.” The boy was on the precipice of panic.

“Whatever happened is in the past.”

Alan was lost there with him. All the frustration. The weight of the world was crushing him down.

“Not just the past,” said Francis. He looked around the room as if a monster was going to jump out of the shadows and eat him. “Past. Present. And Future. And maybe… maybe beyond… cause no one knows what happens after…”

The boy stared at him, then stood and turned away. At first he didn’t move, then, in a moment of courage, he grabbed the hem of his hoodie and t-shirt and lifted them so they bunched around his neck.

“Oh my God,” whispered Alan, his mouth gone suddenly dry.

A long, angry scar, darker than the rest of his skin and jagged like a lightning bolt, ran from between his delicate shoulder blades, across the bony ridges of his spine, down to his narrow waist. Francis pulled his sweatpants down a little to show it continued across his right buttock. He lifted his arms and turned. Small, round scars dotted his rib cage, some old and dark, others scabbed over, others pale where the scabs had peeled away. Cigarette burns. He faced Alan and revealed another gash across his chest that looked fresh and weepy in the early stages of healing.

He allowed him to look, to inspect, then he hooked his thumbs into the waistband of his sweats, bit on his swollen lip, glanced up at the security camera, and lowered the front of his sweatpants. Alan’s stomach churned. He felt a pounding between his eyes.

“My God.”

Above a light dusting of pubic hair… a brand… He had been branded. Some sick fucker had etched a word into the boy’s tender flesh—MAJI.

“Francis…” was all Alan could say.

Francis lowered his shirt, pulled up his sweats, and slumped onto the padded floor, pulling his legs to his chest. A tear trickled down his cheek. His hands trembled as if freezing, but the room was warm. It was too warm for Alan. He was sweating.

“Was it White Owl, Francis?” Alan asked as softly as he could.

“No!” the boy shouted. “No! She’s the only one who helped. They all left me, and she’s the only one!” He sobbed.

“Tell me, Francis. Let me help. Who did this?” A rage was growing in the pit of Alan’s stomach; it wanted to leap out and attack someone.

“The hunters.”

“Hunters?”

Francis nodded. “They’re angry because I helped Amy. They’re coming for me.”

“Francis, no one can hurt you. Let me⁠—”

“What the fuck can you do?” he cried. “You’re blind. You don’t know anything. You’re just like them!” He pointed behind him.

Alan turned. Two police officers in full gear were walking toward the D-Pad door. A tall, muscle-bound brute with a bald head and sharp-trimmed facial hair, and the other a petite woman with fiery red hair.

“I’m going to talk to these officers,” said Alan.

Fear of the unknown shone in Francis’s eyes. He went to the padded bed that stuck out of the far wall, curled into a ball, and pulled his hoodie protectively over him, motionless.

Alan approached the door, wary of their intentions. He needed more time with Francis. More time to connect with him, to figure out how broken he was, who had hurt him, and what it would take to help him.

“Hello, are you Dr. Smith?” asked the female officer.

“That’s right. This is my client. We’re in a session if you don’t mind.”

“I’m Deputy Wolf from the Lake County Sheriff’s Department. This is Acting Sheriff Comstock.” She gestured with her chin to the large cop who rested his hand on his holstered sidearm.

“Mr. Smith, we’re here to transport the prisoner downtown for questioning,” Comstock said.

“It’s Doctor Smith, and he’s my patient, not a prisoner. I’m evaluating his mental condition, and I’d appreciate it if I could finish my session with him.”

Comstock stepped forward until his face was only inches from the glass. “We’re taking him now. You can file the paperwork to meet with him after he’s been processed.”

“Come on. He’s just a boy. He’s scared to death.”

“Doctor? What kind of doctor are you?”

“I’m a psychologist.”

The burly cop laughed. “Right, okay, *Doctor*, that girl he tried to rape is just a girl, and she’s sitting in a hospital room right now, afraid to speak.”

“I read the police report,” said Alan. “Deputy Wolf, your report. It states there were no signs of assault, sexual or otherwise.”

“I’m sorry, Dr. Smith. It’s just the way the system works,” said Deputy Wolf. Her voice was kind and familiar.

“As far as I can tell, this boy doesn’t have a recognized guardian. As his mental health professional, I’m exercising my right to act as guardian pro tempore.”

“Pro tem por ray?” Comstock shook his head with an ironic leer.

“Yes, it’s Latin for temporary. I want to be there for questioning.”

“Mental health practitioner? You liberal fucking snowflakes. Fine!” He shouted back to Sam, “Open!”

Sam’s voice came on over the intercom. “Sorry, Dr. Smith, they have a warrant.”

Alan nodded to the camera in the corner of the room. “Francis, you’re going to be okay. I’ll see you soon.”

The boy didn’t move.

*Bzzt* went the door, and Comstock shoved past Alan. He grabbed Francis by the scruff of his hoodie, ripping him out of his protective fetal position, slammed him against the wall with a thud, and twisted the boy’s skinny arm behind his back.

“Ow!” cried Francis.

The acting sheriff pulled his wrists together and cinched them with a pair of heavy handcuffs.

Francis sucked air through his teeth at the pain.

“What the fuck?” Alan shouted. “You got a goddamn misconduct complaint, you sonuvabitch.” Now Alan was in the cop’s face.

“Make my day,” said Comstock, dragging the boy through the clinic. “Francis Builds A Fire, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you do or say can and will be used against you in a court of law…”

Sam rose from his desk, but Comstock pointed a gloved hand at him. “Back off, boy.”

Sam did not flinch.

They burst out the front door into the dim morning.

“Dr. Smith,” said Wolf under her breath, “don’t fight him. It’ll just make everything harder along the way. Follow the process.” She tried to put a reassuring hand on his arm, but he pulled past her, jogging after Comstock as he dragged Francis to an SUV with flashing lights.

An elderly couple in pastel jogging suits, each walking a poodle, stopped on the sidewalk to gawk.

“Francis! Francis! Listen, you don’t need to talk to them. Wait for your lawyer. Do not talk to them.”

The boy turned his swollen face on Alan with a look of defeat, as if to say, *See, I told you. There’s nothing you can do to help me.*

“Francis,” Alan said, panic in his throat, throwing out professional decorum for something more primal. “I won’t lose you, boy. I won’t lose you again.” Francis had heard him. He looked up at Alan and said something. Something about a hunter, just as the heavy door of the police vehicle was slammed in his face.

“Listen, you shrink fuck,” snarled Comstock. “That little girl, you know who her father is? Look it up, you fucking shrink piece of shit! Don’t you ever get in my fucking way again, or I’ll teach you the meaning of pain.”

The doors slammed, and the next thing Alan knew, the SUV was spinning its tires and whipping out onto the deserted street.

“Fuck!” he shouted.

The elderly couple were still staring.

“What the fuck are you looking at?”

Sensibilities reasonably offended, the pair pulled their poodles close and continued on their way, casting skeptical looks over their shoulders.",2,1733748148.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

""Okay, your place is out, Nick's place is out."" Eastern looked up in the sky as the Hoppers soared overhead. ""My place is probably out by now. What do we do?""

Selkirk's eyes flicked to the crowd. She crossed her arms and looked up at them. ""Come on, we'll figure something out. Let's start walking.”

They walked towards Tulip square with Selkirk in the lead. After a moment she ducked down an alley. Nick and Eastern followed. She walked a bit more, then cut across again to another alley. Turning again, she walked back onto the main street. As she walked, she slowed just a bit until she was between Nick and Eastern. Without turning her head she used her tail, and pointed over her shoulder ahead of them. ""See that guy ahead of us in the blue shirt? He's been following us since we left my place."" Her voice was barely heard over the crowd.

As Nick and Eastern watched, the man in blue walked down the sidewalk with the crowd, seemingly in his own world. As they continued to watch him though, he moved to the side of the flow of traffic and stopped at a coffee counter. Before they got to the counter, Selkirk quickly crossed over to the other side of the street behind a noisy and dusty street sweeper. Glancing over, Nick saw that their potential tail was ostensibly looking at his phone, but his eyes kept flicking up to the crowd. He was searching for something.

Selkirk led them to an Omnibus stop just as the bus rattled to a stop. As they climbed aboard Nick risked another glance. Just as the doors closed, they locked eyes. 

""Shit. He's clocked me."" Nick looks at Eastern and Sel. ""He saw me on the omnibus.""

Over the noise of the bus Eastern sighed. “Ancestors damn you, Nick. I knew you were looking too much.""

Nick was defensive. ""We're already on the omnibus though, what can he do?""

As they approached the next stop, the omnibus pulled to the side early and rattled to a stop. The driver came over an PA. ""Sorry folks, I just got an alert from dispatch. We're going to have to wait here a moment while something processes. I'm sure we'll be on our way in a milisec."" The crowd on the omnibus groaned.

Eastern and Selkirk glare at Nick. ""It could be a coincidence!"" he wailed.

As he said that, the front doors opened and two burly looking people in Houndstooth uniforms climbed aboard, and started looking at everyone.

As the Houndstooth goons walked down the aisle looking at everyone, Nick and Selkirk fret about what to do. There wasn't a rear door to jump out of, and the windows didn't open. Eastern didn't look worried like Nick and Selkirk, she just leaned back in her seat with her eyes closed.

As the goons approached them, one of them locked eyes with Nick and he nudged the other. ""Nicholas North? Selkirk Nemari? Eastern Standard? Please come with us.”

Before they could say anything else, there was a loud hum coming from a pack around both of their belts. They reached down instinctively to the packs and they both tipped their heads back and screamed. Smoke was pouring out from under their hats. Eastern shot up and smacked Nick and Selkirk on the backs of their heads. ""Run!""

Both of them bounded over the seats of the other passengers as they yelled and complained, and the three of them practically fell out of the door of the omnibus.

Eastern took off down the street with Nick and Selkirk following close behind. 

""What was that Eastern? Did you do something?"" Nick struggled to catch up to Eastern and Selkirk as they ran.

“I guess? Sort of? I didn’t really think about what to do, I felt more what I wanted to happen, and it did.” Nick wasn’t quite sure what that meant. He’s used implants before and they didn’t work that way. Eastern looked back at the two of them. ""Course, now that we attacked Houndstooth, I'm not sure what we can do.""

As they rounded a corner, as if to drive the point home, there was a group of 10 Houndstooth guards standing armed with submachine guns. In front of them was a woman in a brown pantsuit standing with arms akimbo. As they skidded to a stop, more Houndstooth goons rushed behind them. They were boxed in.  ""You really shouldn't have done that."" And all three of them had bags placed over their head and the icy pinch of a needle in their respective shoulders.

\*\*\*\*

Once again, Nick came back to the world slowly, painfully. He squinted his face against the pain.

""I am getting sick of waking up this way. I'd like at least a couple of weeks where I'm not drugged and restrained please.""

Nick heard Selkirk groan next to him. ""I'll take the restrained, but not the drugged if we're placing orders."" Nick couldn't turn his head, but he heard the squeak and rumble of restraints as Sel moved around.

Hey, Eastern? He thought.

When he did that, he got a feeling of coffee being made, the smell of Luna, and a burst of music. It felt decidedly odd. Maybe Eastern was still unconscious. Nick opened his eyes, and found he was staring at a white ceiling with lights in regular locations. 

""Sel, have you been awake longer than me?""

""A bit yeah. I think they were worried about overdosing a K'laxi and they did a light dose."" Nick could hear Selkirk move against her restraints again. ""Sure weren't gentle on the straps though. I'm really stuck.""

""Selkirk, I happen to know that you're the one most likely to wiggle out of the straps, that's why I made sure you were strapped in tight.""

Nick heard a new voice. One he didn't recognize. 

""My goodness you three. Not even one day out from your meeting with Jameson Winters and you're already on my radar?"" Nick felt the bed he was strapped to start to tilt up, and the same woman from the street came into view. She was tall, with long red hair in bouncy curls flowing over her shoulders, very leonid looking. Her skin was pale and covered in freckles and she stared at Nick with piercing emerald-green eyes. She still wore the well tailored brown pantsuit from earlier. ""All you had to do was go with the Houndstooth goons. They weren't even going to restrain you. But no, you had to go nuke their comms. How did you do that, anyway? They’re on an encrypted channel.”

Nick was still running through excuses about why or how they nuked encrypted comms and before he could through out an excuse, he heard Eastern rustle. ""Ancestors, Siobhan. You didn't have to fucking drug us."" Her voice sounded thick. She was even more groggy than Nick was.

""I apologize Eastern, it's not my preference. We were in a rush thanks to you playing hard to get with the goons on the omnibus. Not that you care, but they're fine by the way; minor burns where the bone conductive pads stick behind their ears and where the cornet scorched their skin. We gave them some cream and sent them home for the day.""

Nick looked over at Siobhan and then tried to turn his head to see Eastern. He has a strap across his forehead so he couldn’t really move, and Nick could barely see her in his peripheral vision. Siobhan saw Nick trying to move and tisked. ""Nicholas North, always checking on his friends."" She walks over to him. As she fussed with the strap on his forehead he smells her perfume. It's floral and woodsy and... familiar.

As she removed his head strap Nick could look around. They're in a windowless room... somewhere. Eastern and Selkirk were strapped into beds tipped upright like he is. The only other person in the room was Siobhan, but there was a camera in one corner of the room. The only way in or out was a door behind Siobhan.

""I seem to be at a disadvantage... Siobhan. You know who we are, but I don't know you.""

Siobhan started slowly pacing as she talked. ""That's my job Nick. You think you're all sneaky on the edges, doing petty crimes under the nose of Houndstooth. We own Hyacinth Nick, *literally*. If you get away with **anything** it's because we can't be bothered to turn our eye onto you.""

Eastern watched Siobhan pace. She's more with it now than before, she seems to be able to come back from this kind of thing faster than Nick. Another mystery. ""Siobhan, what the hell? What's this all about?""

Siobhan stopped pacing and strode over to Eastern's bed. ""You know what this is about Eastern. Jameson has asked you to find someone. We know Nick boosted the crystal lattice memory from the Houndstooth R&D office outside of Laurel square. Where's the AI. What did you do with her?""

Nick blinks. Before he can open his mouth, Selkirk interrupts. “The cube was empty. We hit a dead end.""

Siobhan's head slowly pivoted over to Selkirk. ""You're lying."" 

Selkirk's ears flick. “Believe us or not, we’re the ones tied up. Jameson took the cube. You want it, go ring him.”

Eastern nods. ""Assuming you didn't get it from him already.”

Siobhan stared hard at Eastern. Without another word, she pivots on her heels and walks out. As she approaches the door it hisses open and then slams shut behind her.

Nick turns his head and looks at Eastern. “She programed the door to slam shut? Talk about being dramatic. Friend of yours?""

Eastern glared and opens her mouth and then stopped. She sighed. ""Former friend, actually. I knew Siobhan when I first got to Hyacinth."" Eastern looked at the door. ""She got picked up after a job went sideways a couple of years back. When she got nabbed, I... ran. I had no idea what happened to her. I figured she did a stint and left or something."" She looked at Nick. ""I had no idea she worked for them now.""

Selkirk turned her head and looked at both of them. ""So, Eastern hon, is this good for us, or bad?""

""We're tied up to beds in a windowless room somewhere in Houndstooth."" Eastern looked at Selkirk with a wry expression. ""It's probably not great for us right now.""

After a moment, Siobhan came in with two other goons. They started immediately unstrapping us from the beds. ""You're lucky Jameson seemed to have taken a shining to you three idiots. I called him, and he said it was empty and never occupied."" Siobhan looks worried.

Nick looked up sharply. ""It ways always empty?""

Siobhan nodded ""Yes, we all appear to have been duped. Come with me."" and without stopping to check and see if anyone is following, she left the room.

Nick looked at Eastern and Selkirk who shrugged and stared back at Nick. Sighing, Nick walked toward the door and out of the room. Everyone followed.

After a moment following Siobhan they come to an office. It's much nicer than the interrogation room they were just in, but still just as windowless. Siobhan sits at a utilitarian desk in the center of the room and gestured to three chairs in front. ""Sit."" She looks up at them. ""Do you want anything to drink? Coffee, Tea, Water?""

""Uh none for me thanks."" Nick sat down in the center chair with Eastern and Selkirk flanking him. 

Siobhan nodded and opened a drawer in her desk. She took out a small silver flask and poured a  generous splash of something into her coffee mug. She took a large sip and winced. ""Okay. Jameson asked you to find this AI right?""

Nick looked at Selkirk who looked at Eastern. She threw up her hands. ""There's no point in hiding anything *now*. We are who knows how deep inside Houndstooth. We could just *not come back out* and nobody would notice.""

Nick shrugged. ""Her name is - was? - is Yon. She's Jameson's daughter."" 

Siobhan laughed. ""That old warhorse has a daughter? When did he manage that?""

Selkirk's ears flicked. ""We don't know. We were just told to find her and bring her home.""

Siobhan leaned forward on her desk and tented her fingers. ""Thanks for being straight with me."" She leaned back and took another gulp of whatever was in her mug. Nick caught a whiff of something acrid, not exactly alcoholic. ""In thanks, I'll be straight with *you*. Since the whole Empress Melody *thing*, AIs willing to work with us have been thin on the ground. Most of the AIs that are still in Sol are quietly living in bodies, desperately trying to not cause trouble.""

Siobhan got up and started pacing again. ""We reached out to the colonies. Asked around. Quietly, you know? Seeing if any AIs were looking to make a little extra money working for us. Nothing official, no big announcements, nothing to make their friends upset.""

She continued on, ""We had received word through an intermediary that someone was interested. An AI with experience and history with folks on Hyacinth so they at least knew who we were. We arranged for the shipping of them to us - at great expense - and *supposedly* they arrived with that crystal memory cube you boosted.""

Siobhan sat back down. “They never arrived.”

Eastern started giggling. Nick and Selkirk looked over, horrified. ""You got taken by some Colonial AIs? Like a bunch of country *rubes*?"" She takes a deep breath and tries to stop laughing. She holds up a hand. ""Gimmie a minute.""

Selkirk looked at Siobhan. ""So you got scammed.""

""Bwa ha ha ha! You got so scammed! Like a kid fresh off a planet!"" Eastern is trying to stop laughing and it is only making it worse.

Siobhan's face was stony. ""Are you done?""

Eastern took another breath and held it. She let it out slowly. ""Okay. *Okay*. Yes, I'm done.""

""Find her. Bring her back to us. *Make* her keep up her end of the deal.""

""Uh"" Selkirk's tail flicks and she looks at Nick and Eastern, then back at Siobhan. ""That's what Jameson hired us to do.""

She shrugged. ""I'll pay double what he's offering.""

Nick raised his eyebrows. ""Can't spend the money if we're dead, Siobhan. If we double cross Jameson, our lifespans will be measured in milliseconds.""

Siobhan leans back into her chair, it squeaking slightly. She tipped the mug back and finished it off. ""Fine. Let's do it this way. Get her back, but *convince* her to work for us. Have her tell her Dad and make it *her* choice. You'll have done what he asked you - you will find his daughter - but you'll also do what we ask - get her to work for us.""

Eastern's shoulders fell. ""Fuck me, Siobhan, do we get a choice?""

She grinned wickedly. ""No, of course not."" She stopped and her expression lightens. ""Well, no, I'm lying. You can chose to say no and we'll kill you. Right here, right now. So, which will it be?""

About 10 minutes later, an anonymous door in a back alley opens, and the three of them are shoved out, wearing blindfolds. ""Go on, dust off."" a goon ripped the blindfolds off. ""And remember, we're *everywhere*, do don't even think about fucking us over."" The door slamed shut.

Nick, Eastern and Selkirk stumble out into the street and find a bench. The three of them fall into the bench and Eastern and Selkirk lean against Nick.

Nick puts his arms around the both of them. ""Well, fuck us then.""",7,1733748087.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1ha8slp,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1ha8slp/milestone_4_months_down_50_lbs/,Milestone: 4 Months - down 50 lbs,"This weekend I hit a major milestone in my carnivore diet process.  I started (lazily) the 1st week of September and then got serious the 2nd week.  I say ""lazily"" the 1st week because I was still drinking alcohol daily and that slowed my start, but the 2nd week I decided to cut out drinking during the week as well.  That's when it REALLY started to make a difference.

It has now been 4 months and this weekend I hit the 50 lbs mark.  I started at 235-240 lbs, which was just plain FAT for a man my size (5'6"") and now I am 185 lbs.  Just wanted to post a little brag because I am digging how effective this diet/lifestyle is.  After the holidays I'm going to start working on strength training and take it to the next level.  

My daily food intake is pretty simple/basic.  2-3 boiled eggs in the morning with coffee/water.  Lunch is usually some beef: crockpot roast, steak, or taco meat with cheese (no tortilla) and then I rarely eat dinner.  I might have a pickle (I know, not carnivore) or some pork rinds just so I'm not hungry, but I find that really don't ""need"" to eat dinner everyday anymore.  The biggest changes happened (IMO) because of cutting out ALL sodas/sugary drinks, cutting back to alcohol only on weekends (with low/no carb mixers), cutting out all pastas/breads/tortillas.  Add in a 2-3 mile walk after work and the weight has just been falling off at a steady 3 lbs per week.  

Anyone considering this diet, I'd highly recommend it.  Very easy to be successful if you just make some simple changes and plan your meals for the week.  If I can do it at 47 yrs old...so can YOU!!",12,1733747947.0,carnivorediet,4,0.93,False

Recently, I met this guy I was really into—he was cute and fun to be with. At first, everything was going well, but the mood shifted when he called one of the service crew members “tanga” because his order came out as a brownie affogato instead of a caramel drink.

As if that wasn’t enough, he made a comment about meeting me in person because I was “the only person on the app who doesn’t look like a tambay, mabaho, or dirty.” That completely turned me off. The night ended with us waving goodbye after coffee, and I went home feeling unsettled.

When I got home, I decided to chat with him about it. I told him I didn’t like how he treated people, especially service workers, and that calling them names like “tanga” was uncalled for. I explained that he could’ve given constructive criticism instead of being rude, and that service crew members deserve respect—they’re not his maids.

His response? He accused me of being self-righteous.

Now I’m left wondering: did I do something wrong? Should I have just let it slide? I really hate it when people call others names and treat them poorly.

1ha8quj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HydrogenWaterFast/comments/1ha8quj/water_fast_and_insulin/,Water Fast And Insulin,"The Impact of Water Fast on Insulin Sensitivity
-----------------------------------------------

Water fasting, which involves abstaining from food while consuming only water for a certain duration, has gained popularity for its potential health benefits. One key area of interest is how water fasting influences insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity refers to how effectively the body's cells respond to insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. Understanding the relationship between water fasting and insulin sensitivity can provide insights into metabolic health and weight management.

When you consume food, your body breaks it down into glucose, which enters the bloodstream. The pancreas releases insulin to facilitate the uptake of glucose by cells for energy. However, with excessive food intake and low physical activity, the body can become less responsive to insulin, resulting in decreased insulin sensitivity. This can contribute to health issues such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Water fasting may present a unique approach to improving insulin sensitivity. During a fast, your body uses stored glycogen for energy. Once glycogen stores are depleted, it starts to burn fat, leading to a reduction in body fat over time. This switch from glucose to fat as a fuel source helps stabilize blood sugar levels and may enhance insulin sensitivity.

Several studies have explored the effects of fasting on insulin sensitivity. Here are some significant findings:

- **Decrease in Insulin Levels:** Fasting can lower circulating insulin levels. Lower insulin levels can enhance insulin sensitivity, allowing cells to respond better to the hormone.
- **Improved Glucose Tolerance:** Research indicates that fasting can improve how well the body handles glucose. Improved glucose tolerance means your body can manage blood sugar levels more effectively, reducing the risk of insulin resistance.
- **Hormonal Changes:** Fasting triggers the release of hormones such as glucagon and norepinephrine, which promote fat burning and may improve insulin sensitivity.

Another aspect to consider is the duration of water fasting. Short-term fasting (24 to 72 hours) generally leads to beneficial metabolic adaptations, while longer fasting periods (beyond 72 hours) might have varying effects. Extended fasting may initially increase insulin sensitivity, but the body's response can differ based on individual health status, activity levels, and existing metabolic conditions.

It's important to highlight that while water fasting could improve insulin sensitivity, it may not be suitable for everyone. Individuals with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, should approach fasting with caution. If you’re considering water fasting as a method to enhance insulin sensitivity, consult a healthcare professional before initiating any fasting regimen.

In addition to the fasting itself, a balanced diet post-fast can further support improvements in insulin sensitivity. Here are some dietary tips:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Focus on whole foods:** Incorporate fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
- **Minimize processed foods:** Reduce intake of sugary snacks and refined carbohydrates that can spike insulin levels.
- **Stay hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water throughout the day helps maintain overall health and supports metabolic processes.

Moreover, combining water fasting with regular physical activity can amplify the benefits. Exercise itself enhances insulin sensitivity. Pairing the two may lead to even greater health improvements. Aerobic activities, resistance training, and lifestyle changes that incorporate movement can complement fasting efforts.

Water fasting can positively impact insulin sensitivity, aiding in the prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the effects can vary based on duration and individual health factors. Always prioritize safety and seek professional guidance to ensure that water fasting is appropriate for your specific health needs. Making dietary adjustments and integrating exercise into your routine can further assist in enhancing insulin sensitivity, paving the way for a healthier and more balanced life.

Benefits of Intermittent Fasting in Managing Insulin Levels
-----------------------------------------------------------

Managing insulin levels is essential for maintaining overall health, especially for people with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. One effective strategy that has gained attention is intermittent fasting. This eating pattern involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting, which can positively influence insulin levels. Here are some key benefits of intermittent fasting in managing insulin levels.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Improved Insulin Sensitivity

One of the primary benefits of intermittent fasting is its ability to enhance insulin sensitivity. When you fast, your body begins to use stored fat for energy rather than relying on glucose from food. This process can lead to a reduced level of insulin in the blood, allowing your cells to become more responsive to insulin when it is present. Improved insulin sensitivity means your body requires less insulin to lower blood sugar levels, benefitting those who struggle with insulin resistance.

### Reduced Blood Sugar Levels

Intermittent fasting can help lower blood sugar levels. During fasting periods, you are not consuming food, which decreases your blood sugar levels naturally. Research has shown that people who engage in intermittent fasting often see a notable dip in their blood glucose levels. Lower blood sugar levels can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and help those already diagnosed better manage their condition.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Weight Management

Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for controlling insulin levels. Intermittent fasting can promote weight loss by limiting your eating window. With fewer hours to eat, you may naturally consume fewer calories without actively counting them. As you shed excess weight, your body becomes more efficient in using insulin, leading to improved glucose metabolism.

### Hormonal Balance

Intermittent fasting helps regulate various hormones, including insulin. When you fast, your body lowers insulin levels, which can lead to better overall hormonal balance. Lower insulin levels allow other hormones, such as human growth hormone (HGH), to rise. This shift supports weight loss and muscle maintenance while also promoting better insulin function.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Enhanced Metabolic Health

This eating pattern may also contribute to better metabolic health. Intermittent fasting encourages cellular repair processes and enhances the body’s ability to metabolize fats and sugars. These metabolic adaptations promote stable energy levels and improve overall health, further easing the strain on insulin regulation. By focusing on meals in a limited timeframe, you may find it easier to keep track of what you eat, leading to healthier food choices.

### Potential Heart Health Benefits

- Intermittent fasting has been linked to improved cholesterol levels.
- It may decrease inflammation, which is often a contributor to heart disease.
- Lower insulin levels can reduce the risk of developing heart-related issues.

### Convenience and Simplicity

Many people find intermittent fasting to be simple and straightforward. Instead of preparing multiple meals throughout the day, you focus on fewer meals, which can save time and effort. This approach makes it easier to stick to healthier eating habits. By eliminating snacks and focusing on more substantial meals, you may inadvertently reduce your overall carbohydrate intake, contributing to better insulin management.

Like, real ones, not the ‘I’ll smile to your face and talk behind your back’ kind. Girls, why the drama? Why the betrayal arcs? Is it too much to ask for friendships without the side of pettiness?

Seriously though, how do you find your people? The ones who are loyal, honest, and don’t turn every little thing into a reality show plot twist?

1ha8o4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1ha8o4z/increasingly_difficult_relationship_with_my_sister/,Increasingly difficult relationship with my sister ,"I f(38) am finding it increasingly difficult to maintain a relationship with my sister f(45).

I am currently pregnant with my first baby. I am in a same sex relationship and have used a donor to start our family. Since we announced that we are expecting a child together my sister has been saying and doing increasingly problematic things.

She keeps emphasising that the child is not genetically my partners and how she will be a closer relative to the baby than my partner. Telling me that I don’t understand how it’s going to be when I have the baby because in heterosexual relationships men know their role but my partner won’t. 

She has always been rude to my partner generally but it has really ramped up lately. We were supposed to meet for an event this weekend and she left us both waiting for over 2 hours outdoors in the freezing cold for her, her husband and children to arrive. We missed most of the event and when she arrived she behaved like it was our fault she couldn’t find her way there and had also stopped to get herself food and coffee before meeting us knowing how late she was, and there was food being served at the event. I would have just left when it hit the 2 hour mark but I stayed for my nephews I didn’t want to disappoint them. 

We got through what was left of the event but it was quite uncomfortable overall. As we went to go our separate ways home, she added that she is hosting dinner over Xmas at her house and asked if we could make it, and would invite my brother too. When asked about dates my partner mentioned she would need to work a couple of days over Xmas and my sister responded oh that’s fine then you can come alone. I just said I’d see, but honestly I’ve no interest in spending time at her house, particularly given her attitude to my partner. 

Additionally given I am managing diabetes with this pregnancy I don’t want to have a day where I leave when I eat up to her given she was fine to leave me waiting so long today. I also don’t drive so would be relying on her picking me up and dropping me home as public transport is limited between where we live on the Xmas dates. 

Tl;dr my sister is rude to my partner, and has an attitude that is borderline or possibly out front homophobic and I don’t really know what to do. ",3,1733747527.0,BabyBumps,9,0.67,False

Well I’ve been waking up every hour, shaky and jittery and nervous. I was cold in my room, which I never am, so I freaked out that I could possibly be sick. I called my fiancé and he calmed me down a bit. I had nausea from getting worked up but it went away and I laid back down for another hour, then had to get up again. Each time I’ve gotten up I’ve been shaky and had to go to the bathroom. 

I did not eat very healthy today, and I had two cups of coffee since the Christmas parade was tonight and I didn’t want to miss out on something to drink. Now I’m regretting it a lot. Does this sound like I have anxiety? I can’t really control my shaking. I wake up each hour to use the restroom. I made myself feel nauseous with worry.

I can help with tasks like jhadu, pocha, bartan,  cleaning washrooms—whatever might make your day a little easier. Bonus: I also make a great cup of tea or coffee! I’m happy to offer this support without any expectation of payment, except for metro fare on a visit basis.

I’m available 2-3 times a week, depending on my work schedule and your convenience. I want to emphasize that this is simply a way for me to stay grounded, meet new people, and contribute to someone’s life in a meaningful way.

Let’s rewind a bit. Picture my apartment: as cozy as a bear den in summer until that bear forgot to pay the heating bill. This little heater promised to transform my icy habitat into a Cancun-esque oasis. Also promised were fancy perks like safety switches and a compact design—perfect for someone with an affinity for tripping over cords (guilty as charged).

Now, fast forward to the unboxing: a cute, unassuming widget that could barely scare a mouse. But like the underdog in every feel-good movie, this little heater packed a punch. I set it up, immediately cranked it to full blast, and waited for tropical winds to blow through my living room. Spoiler: It did get warm. Impressive for something I once mistook for a lunchbox.

However, every lovable character has quirks, and the QQT is no different. It hums like it's practicing for a karaoke night, a detail that Mr. Whiskers (my ever-skeptical cat) finds utterly suspicious. He has started watching it like a hawk, which makes for some unintentional comedic moments.

And boy, oh boy, talk about quirky shutdowns. I was testing its trip protection when, during one lazy, nap-induced stupor, it clicked off automatically. Golden star for safety! Though I wonder if my cousin might attempt to tip it over again, this time deliberately—his contribution to our family gatherings being questionable at best.

Here's the buzzkill – while I've so far escaped a monstrous electric bill, my ears haven't escaped this device's constant whir. It’s like having a tiny airplane taking off repeatedly beside your ear, which I find endearing but might remind others of a busy coffee shop or busy thoughts.

Before you dash to rearrange your living spaces for its arrival, here are a few need-to-knows. It's not the best for large rooms, so don't expect it to be the North Star of your entire home. And you’ll need to personally cater to it, given the glaring absence of a remote control. Hello, step count.

Despite fielding several challenges like the cord being shorter than an impulsive haircut and covering limited ground, this heater has snuggled its way into my heart. It’s been my winter’s door to warmth, adding that perfect blanket level of comfort to my oft-neglected study nook.

So there it is, my QQT tale. We’ve been through pet dramas, cousin antics, and staying warm despite hellacious drafts. It might not have bells, whistles, or remote control symphonies, but it's caught a spot in my small-space living world. It's like an old sweater—you know there are newer, fancier things out there, but you wouldn’t trade it for them.

In the end, though the cheese grater hum of my QQT won’t score any awards for the best white noise, it scores all the possible warmth points for chilly souls like mine and patient cats like Mr. Whiskers everywhere.",1,1733746675.0,SpaceHeaters101,0,1.0,False
