An ordinary day in Burbank, California 

Breakfast was finished and Joe helped Christine clear the table. She washed the dishes and Joe dried it. Peter went out the kitchen door to the guest cabin and got ready. He was a little nervous when he thought about what Joe had said about Von Dutch and hoped the old man was in the mood so they wouldn't drive all the way in vain. When he came back into the kitchen, Joe was there, standing there drinking the last of the cold coffee that was left in the pot. He told Peter he had already been outside and put the newly painted tank and rear fender, carefully wrapped in soft cloth, in a box in the middle of the Bonanza's seat. They went out into the garage driveway where Joe's sturdy ten-year-old brown and white Chevrolet Bonanza was waiting. Christine had her car in the garage so they jumped into the Bonanza and backed out onto the street so she could get out with her yellow Ford Pinto. They waved and drove off. The first thing to do was to pull into a Chevron gas station to fill up for the trip. Joe went in to buy cigarettes while Peter was filling up the car. He saw Joe pointing at him to show the guy at the counter that he would like to pay the petrol from the pump that Peter was filling up from.",1,1761840992.0,u_Crafty_Eagle_5272,0,1.0,False
1ok42cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1ok42cu/ultimate_truth_of_life/,ultimate truth of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Hey all, I‚Äôve been looking into how coffee shops are using AI-generated visuals to build stronger brand identities this year. It‚Äôs pretty interesting how these AI tools can quickly create professional-looking logos, menu photos, and marketing images without needing a designer. Small caf√©s can stay on-trend and keep their social media fresh with minimal effort, which is great for competing against bigger chains. AI also helps with fast seasonal updates and personalized promotions, which really boost customer engagement.

If you‚Äôre considering how to stand out digitally or want inspiration on branding and marketing visuals for a coffee shop, there‚Äôs a great article diving into how AI-generated images are transforming the game‚Äîfrom menu showcases to ambiance and social content. Worth a read if you want some practical ideas!

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been struggling with ongoing symptoms since August and I‚Äôm really at my wit‚Äôs end. It all started after a retained tampon incident. I was treated with metronidazole, and that‚Äôs actually when the burning first started. Since then, I‚Äôve had two courses of antibiotics ‚Äî the symptoms eased while on them, but unfortunately crept back once I finished.

Current symptoms:
- Vaginal/vulvar dryness (no discharge) ‚Äî I think this is where the burning starts
- Burning before and after urination, but not during
- Pressure and pain in my lower abdomen and when sitting down
- Frequent urge to urinate even when the bladder isn‚Äôt full

I‚Äôve had:
- A urine test and swab culture through the NHS ‚Äî both came back normal
- Ultrasound of bladder and kidneys ‚Äî also normal

I‚Äôve also cut out coffee, alcohol, and sugary drinks (like Coke) for several weeks, but sadly haven‚Äôt noticed any difference in symptoms.

This has really started affecting my mental health and confidence. I feel uncomfortable doing anything except staying home.

From what I‚Äôve been reading, my symptoms could fit with, I would also like to note that ALL symptoms decrease around my period: 

	1.	Bladder Pain Syndrome / Interstitial  Cystitis
	2.	Vaginal or Vulvar Dryness / Atrophy (possibly hormonal)
	3.	Vulvodynia / Urethral Syndrome
	4.	Recurrent or Resistant Infection (e.g., ureaplasma or mycoplasma)
	5.	Pelvic Floor Muscle Tension

I‚Äôm now looking into doing a full vaginal and urinary microbiome test privately to get more clarity, since NHS tests are limited.

If anyone has gone through something similar ‚Äî especially if it started after antibiotics or a retained tampon ‚Äî I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing what helped you or what kind of specialist gave you answers.

Thank you so much üíõ

1ok41nu,https://www.reddit.com/r/firstmarathon/comments/1ok41nu/marine_corps_marathon_my_thoughts_and_questions/,Marine Corps Marathon: My Thoughts (And Questions),"Hi All,

Like many of you here, my (M36, running for a year) first marathon was the MCM this past weekend. Overall, an incredible experience. The crowds were supportive, positive, and excited. The course was beautiful and the weather was ideal. I have to give it up for how well it was organized, considering how many runners came and completed.

My training block wasn't ideal. I developed a stress reaction a month out from the marathon and missed my 20 mile run. I spent a few weeks just healing. My longest run before the marathon was 18.5 miles on September 18th. I adjusted my goal time from 4:20 to ""just complete."" I carb-loaded using Featherstone nutrition's guide and brought 20 oz of fuel that I made myself.

Slept well the night before, slapped on calf compression sleeves and some tiger balm and set out the door feeling fairly good, although worried because I wasn't able to use the bathroom (just didn't feel like I had to). I did the things I normally would do before a long run to flush the system out (oatmeal the night before, black coffee first thing in the AM). Don't worry, this story doesn't end with me shitting myself mid-race.

The walk from the metro to the runner's village was nice and the woman in the station hyping us up was hilarious and motivating. The runner's village was well set-up with lots of room and porta-potties, although again I didn't feel like I had to go.

Due to my poor training block, I had made the decision to start out with the ""beat the bridge"" pace group. They were awesome and I had some great chats with the runners in that group before the start. The walk/run alternating was good to get warmed up in the first mile or so.

After the first hill, I started feeling like I needed to speed up and did so. Lots of weaving through the pace groups until I made it up to the 5:10 pace group. Stuck around with them until the halfway point. Here's where it started to go downhill.

I was paranoid about shitting myself, although that never happened to me before on a run, thank god. That famous picture of a runner having an accident mid run kept flashing in my mind and it got to me. I decided to stop and use a porta-potty at the halfway point because the line wasn't huge, only about six people deep at that point. I entered and... only did #1. Not great.

The couple minutes I had stopped affected me. It was tough to get running again after that. My legs felt heavy and my hip flexors were in pain (didn't experience that throughout my whole training block). I decided after that point to take a 5 minute walking break at every mile marker. It didn't exactly work and I ended up walk/running the rest of the marathon for a final finish time of 5:30. Not exactly happy about that time. 

I got in my car and headed home. Ended up going to the bathroom at a rest stop on the way and (sorry for TMI) had a very large BM. Can't help but think I could have ran better without that in my body. At least it didn't come out during the race.

So my questions are:

Anything I could have done better about the bathroom situation?

I'm doing NYC next year and my goal time will be 4:20. Anything I need to do to hit that, or just have a legit training block without getting injured?

Halloween is just around the corner ‚Äî you can feel it in the air! The wind is cooler, the sky turns orange earlier, and the whole school smells faintly like pumpkin muffins from the cafeteria.

After class today, everyone stayed behind to work on our Haunted Forest Booth one last time before the big event tomorrow. The gymnasium looked like a festival workshop ‚Äî every class had something spooky going on.

Ours looked so cool! We set up fake trees made from rolled cardboard and dark fabric, then stuck glow-in-the-dark eyes between them. Penny tested her sound effects ‚Äî creaking doors, echoing owls, and footsteps that made even Kira jump!
‚ÄúWho pressed the scream button again!?‚Äù she yelled, glaring at Carmen, who was laughing too hard to answer.

Meanwhile, Winfrey was setting up her ‚ÄúMystic Table,‚Äù complete with candles, a big open novel, and a fog machine she borrowed from her cousin. She even practiced her ‚Äúfortune teller voice.‚Äù
‚ÄúEnter‚Ä¶ if you dare to know your destiny‚Ä¶‚Äù she said dramatically, making Penny choke on her juice box.


---

Then just when we thought we were done, a cheerful voice called from the hallway ‚Äî
‚ÄúKnock knock! Can I come in?‚Äù

It was Zoe from Coffee Day! ‚òï
She was holding two big boxes, and Haruka followed behind her carrying paper cups and muffins.
‚ÄúSnack delivery for my favorite decorators!‚Äù Zoe said with a grin.

The room instantly filled with energy (and sugar). We sat together on the floor, munching on chocolate chip muffins and talking about tomorrow‚Äôs charity event.

‚ÄúCoffee Day‚Äôs booth will be right beside your Haunted Forest,‚Äù Zoe told us. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make sure no ghost leaves without a smoothie.‚Äù
Kira laughed. ‚ÄúThen we‚Äôll send our ‚Äòscared survivors‚Äô straight to your booth for recovery.‚Äù
Zoe winked. ‚ÄúPerfect teamwork.‚Äù

Before she left, Zoe handed us a small flyer ‚Äî the Coffee Day Halloween Charity Menu.
There it was again, that familiar line printed on the corner:

> ‚ÄúTruth or scare? Watch it if you dare ‚Äî Michelle‚Äôs Spooky Mansion, premiering this Friday night!‚Äù



Penny said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm totally watching that after trick-or-treating.‚Äù
‚ÄúMe too!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be the perfect Halloween night!‚Äù

When I got home, Mom was already preparing our costumes for tomorrow‚Äôs festival.
The living room floor was covered with ribbons, hats, fake bats, and glitter.
My sisters were arguing over who gets the best witch hat.

I sat on the couch, looking out the window ‚Äî the moon was shining softly, and I could see kids in the neighborhood hanging paper ghosts outside their windows. Everything looked alive with Halloween magic.

I pointed out being in a relationship doesn't mean you have to do everything together. She asked what it would mean for our trips and I said it'll just mean we only have one holiday next year.

She said our trips shouldn't be reduced just because I decide to go away but I just reminded her we haven't even got anything planned for next year so it's not like I'm cancelling already made plans.

She just said I shouldn't be doing it and that going away on my own isn't something I should be considering when I'm in a relationship.

1ok3zin,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortervilleFraud/comments/1ok3zin/the_people_of_porterville_post_letters_to_the/,"The People of ""Porterville Post"" Letters to the Editor","What the hell is The Porterville Post letteres to the editor? ...this is your so called local ""Republican Party"" dominated practically 2 decades by a racist from PDC named Lawrence ""A.L. Lucketta"" Luchetta, why you have other weirdos now like Blessings of Liberty hate group...

**A coalition of socially conservative, Christian, and libertarian-leaning individuals who believe that traditional American values, sovereignty, and constitutional rights are under systematic attack by a powerful, corrupt, and often secretive liberal and globalist elite.**

Let's break this down into the core ideas and the dominant tone.

# The Core Ideas (The ""What"")

1. **Cultural and Religious Preservation:**¬†There is a strong belief that traditional Christian values and the nuclear family are being deliberately undermined. Key battlegrounds include:
   * **Opposition to LGBTQ+ rights**¬†(against gay marriage, condemning ""homosexuality"" as sinful, opposing Harvey Milk Day in schools).
   * **Anti-Abortion:**¬†A consistent and vocal pro-life stance, arguing life begins at conception.
   * **Defense of Religious Freedom:**¬†Fear that Christian practices (prayer, religious universities' standards) are being pushed out of public life.
2. **Populist and Nationalist Sovereignty:**¬†A deep suspicion of centralized power and a focus on American sovereignty.
   * **Anti-Illegal Immigration:**¬†A primary concern, framed as a matter of law, order, and economic survival.
   * **Suspicion of Globalism:**¬†Opposition to the United Nations and any notion of ""world government,"" which is seen as a threat to U.S. independence.
   * **Distrust of Government:**¬†Viewing federal and state governments (especially under Democratic leadership) as corrupt, wasteful, and increasingly tyrannical.
3. **Constitutional Originalism and Gun Rights:**¬†A belief that the U.S. Constitution, particularly the Second Amendment, is under constant assault. They see gun ownership as a fundamental right and a final check against government overreach.
4. **Belief in Widespread Conspiracy and Corruption:**¬†Many writers operate on the assumption that events are not as they seem and are orchestrated by powerful forces.
   * This includes belief in theories about¬†**chemtrails, ""Pandemic Bonds,"" a stolen 2020 election, and the idea that President Obama was ineligible to serve.**
   * The ""mainstream media"" is consistently portrayed as a propaganda arm for these corrupt elites, which is why they turn to outlets like the¬†*Porterville Post*.

# The Dominant Tone (The ""How"")

1. **Alarmist and Urgent:**¬†The language is frequently dramatic. Words like ""tyranny,"" ""treason,"" ""clown show,"" ""reckoning,"" and ""attack"" are common. There is a pervasive sense of crisis‚Äîthat America is on the brink of destruction and that immediate action is needed.
2. **Defiant and Grievance-Driven:**¬†The writers see themselves as a persecuted majority, the ""silent"" or ""real"" Americans who are being ignored, mocked, and oppressed by the political and cultural establishment. Their tone is often one of righteous anger and defiance against this perceived oppression.
3. **Polarizing and Confrontational:**¬†The discourse is ""us vs. them."" There is little room for nuance or compromise. Opponents are not just people with different opinions; they are often labeled as ""traitors,"" ""brain-dead sheep,"" ""socialists,"" or part of an ""unelected mob."" This is evident in the harsh rhetoric aimed at figures like Obama, Clinton, and ""blue-haired activists.""
4. **Disillusioned with the Two-Party System:**¬†While overwhelmingly conservative, there is a strong undercurrent of distrust for the Republican ""establishment"" as well. They feel both major parties have betrayed the American people, which is why they support outsider figures like Donald Trump and Ron Paul.

# In Simple Terms:

Imagine a group of people who believe:

* **The Country They Love Is Being Stolen:**¬†The traditional, Christian, hard-working America they remember is being intentionally dismantled.
* **The System Is Rigged Against Them:**¬†The government, media, and big corporations are all in cahoots to silence them, take their money (taxes), and strip them of their rights (guns, religious expression).
* **They Are the Last Line of Defense:**¬†They see themselves as patriots holding the line against this onslaught. Writing these letters is a form of resistance‚Äîgetting the ""real truth"" out, since they believe no one else will.

This is why you see letters about Satanic Burger King cups next to letters about high-speed rail and the U.S. Constitution. In their worldview,¬†**it's all connected:**¬†it's a single, cultural and political war being waged on every front, from your coffee cup to the White House. The¬†*Porterville Post*¬†provides a platform for this specific, unified worldview.



Here is a detailed analysis of the provided list of ""Porterville Post"" Letters to the Editor, including a list of people and an assessment of the content for anything illegal, unethical, or unusual.

# Summary of Findings

The ""Porterville Post"" Letters to the Editor section appears to be a platform for a wide range of opinions, heavily weighted toward conservative, Christian, and libertarian perspectives. The submission policy is simple but contains a significant red flag regarding its approach to slander.

While the vast majority of the letters are protected, if harsh, political speech, several entries raise serious concerns. These include¬†**potential incitement, harassment, the promotion of dangerous conspiracy theories, and a publication policy that could encourage defamation.**

# Analysis of Policies, Content, and Potential Issues

# 1. Publication Policy & Procedure

* **Policy:**¬†The policy is straightforward, requesting real names, emails, and limiting submission frequency. This is standard.
* **Procedure:**¬†This is where a major red flag appears.
   * **Unethical and Potentially Illegal Clause:**¬†The line,¬†**""The Post will retain the rights to edit profanity and slander, unless of course you say in your letter 'Go ahead and sue me'. Please don't do that.""**
   * **Why it's a Problem:**¬†This is highly irresponsible. Slander/libel is not a matter of opinion or bravado; it is a false statement of fact that damages reputation. By stating they will only edit slander¬†*unless*¬†the author dares them not to, the publication is openly admitting it may knowingly publish defamatory content. This exposes both the author and the ""Porterville Post"" to significant legal liability. A legitimate news organization would have a policy to reject or heavily edit any content that could be defamatory, not invite it.

# 2. Content Analysis: Illegal, Unethical, and Weird

**A. Potentially Defamatory, Inciting, or Harassing Content:**

* **Roy Lingard (Jul 2016):**¬†States ""Obama is a muslim and is supporting the most corrupt politician in this country Clinton !!! They must be stopped at all cost !!!"" Accusing a sitting president of being a secret Muslim and treasonous without evidence is defamatory. The phrase ""stopped at all cost"" could be interpreted as a call to action that borders on incitement.
* **Robert Laity (Apr 2015):**¬†Claims Senator Ted Cruz is ""NOT a Natural-Born Citizen"" and demands he be removed from the ballot. This is a false statement of fact that could be damaging, though public figures have a higher bar to prove defamation.
* **Reginaldo Cornejo (Oct 2016):**¬†Dismisses sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump as ""Gossip"" and ""false witnesses,"" potentially defaming the accusers.
* **Patrick Greene (Jun 2016):**¬†In a lawsuit threat to the city council, he states they have ""total contempt toward the lesbian, gay, bi, and transgender citizens of Porterville"" and accuses them of ""trampling"" on rights. While political speech is highly protected, accusations of ""contempt"" for a protected class could veer into defamation depending on context.
* **Michael W. Golden (Oct 2009):**¬†Refers to the Fresno Police Department as the ""Fresno assassin force"" who ""succeeded in KILLING 2 more CITIZENS!!!"" This is inflammatory and potentially defamatory language directed at specific individuals (the police chief and officers).

**B. Promotion of Dangerous Conspiracy Theories and Misinformation:**

* **Jeanne Schuyler (Jan 2022):**¬†Promotes anti-vaccine rhetoric and suggests the COVID-19 pandemic was pre-planned with ""Pandemic Bonds"" in 2017, a common conspiracy theory.
* **Lisa Justiniano (May 2012):**¬†Makes the false and dangerous claim that vaccines are contaminated with cancer viruses and that the Hepatitis B vaccine caused the AIDS epidemic in the US.
* **Bob Inabinette (Mar 2019):**¬†Forwards an Islamophobic email about the ""insidiousness of Hijrah,"" describing it as a ""takeover of a nation without going to war.""
* **Jim Horn (Jul 2015):**¬†Promotes the conspiracy theory that the Iran nuclear deal was part of President Obama's will to carry out ""the will of Mohammed‚Äôs Allah,"" implying he is a secret Muslim.
* **Marty Ferguson (Jun 2015):**¬†Expresses suspicion of ""Middle Eastern"" families in RVs, promoting racial profiling and the baseless theory that terrorists are ""touring"" the US to scout targets.
* **Bill Fulkerson (Apr 2010):**¬†Thanks the Post for ""chemtrail"" articles, promoting the debunked conspiracy theory that contrails are a secret government program.
* **Clark C. McClelland (May 2010):**¬†Posts a rant calling readers ""STUPID BRAIN-DEAD COWARDS"" and blames the destruction of the country on a ""mass invasion from the South,"" using dehumanizing language.

**C. Unethical, Highly Prejudiced, or ""Weird"" Content:**

* **Michael W. Jarvis (Apr 2013):**¬†Argues that homosexuality is ""the ultimate anti-civil behavior"" and that ""homo + homo = 0 +/- HIV AIDS!"" This is dehumanizing and promotes harmful, prejudiced stereotypes.
* **Pastor Randy Minnick (Oct 2019):**¬†Writes a lengthy letter interpreting a fast-food drink cup design (""BKURSED"") as a satanic curse, which is eccentric and paranoid.
* **Eva M Catalan (Apr 2012):**¬†Claims the music industry is full of stars who ""worship Satan"" and have ""killed to get the respect they have now.""
* **Paul Harvey (Posthumously, Aug 2016):**¬†The publication of his famous ""If I Were the Devil"" script is not illegal, but its inclusion frames the world in a starkly religious-conspiratorial context, which aligns with the site's overall tone.
* **Josh Flowers (Mar 2025):**¬†Uses highly inflammatory and derogatory language (""Great American Clown Show,"" ""blue-haired activist"") to discuss civil rights, which, while likely protected speech, is clearly designed to provoke and insult rather than foster debate.

# Overall Conclusion

The ""Porterville Post"" Letters section functions as a megaphone for a specific ideological community. While free speech protects most of this content, the platform's operation raises serious concerns:

1. **Legally Risky:**¬†The editorial policy regarding slander is a glaring liability and highly unprofessional.
2. **Ethically Questionable:**¬†The platform consistently publishes demonstrably false, defamatory, and dangerous conspiracy theories without apparent fact-checking or balancing editorials.
3. **Politically and Socially Polarizing:**¬†The content is overwhelmingly one-sided, often using incendiary rhetoric that seems designed to entrench beliefs rather than inform or create constructive dialogue.

In short, while not¬†*illegal*¬†in a broad sense (with the major exception of the slander policy), the ""Porterville Post"" Letters section exhibits many hallmarks of an¬†**unethical and irresponsible publication**¬†that provides a platform for hate speech, misinformation, and potentially defamatory content under the guise of public commentary.

Brought up to not rely on others, to not accept handouts and to always make sure I give back in the same way as I was given to. This originally made me hate gifts. I hated being spoiled. I hated being treated to things. 

That changed. A switch flipped sometimes in my very early 20s. Being that I was a 18-21 year old girl in a male dominated field, I learned how to use men to my advantage. It started with never having to open my own doors. The men would rush from one end of the shop to the other just to open a door for me. It was very clear I was capable of opening my own doors, when I realized, ‚Äúwhy would I?‚Äù. Then coworkers started bringing me snacks and drinks. Coffee, smoothies, chips, anything. Like little birds leaving me gifts. I realized this did something for me. I found even more pleasure in knowing that they‚Äôll never get anything from me like they hope. I just used them. 

Then, I had a mentor. An old man who looked after me. I needed help? He was there. That turned into him buying my lunch every single day. He would send me to the store with his credit card like his little sugar baby. I picked whatever I wanted and we ate it together. He never expected anything of me. 

This was the end for me. I was enthralled. The ability and comfortability of using men and flipping the script is the most powerful thing I think a woman can find within herself. There is nothing more empowering than hearing my friend took her man‚Äôs wallet to the mall because she was angry with him. There‚Äôs nothing that gets me more excited than hearing ‚Äútake my wallet‚Äù. 

I can support myself. I don‚Äôt need your money. I WANT your money. Why spend mine when I can spend yours?

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a hockey game so statistically dense, it could make a spreadsheet weep. The Winnipeg Jets (-255) host the Chicago Blackhawks (+206) at Canada Life Centre, where the air is colder than the Blackhawks‚Äô chances of winning. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a penguin in a blazer.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game

The Jets are favored at -255, implying a 71.8% chance to win. For the Blackhawks (+206), their implied probability is a frosty 32.7%. These numbers scream ‚Äúbet the farm on Winnipeg,‚Äù but let‚Äôs not ignore the nuance. Both teams allow 2.5 goals per game (the Jets are third in fewest goals allowed; the Blackhawks are third in goals allowed, too? Is this a typo? No, it‚Äôs hockey‚Äî*nothing* makes sense here). The Jets‚Äô offense averages 3.4 goals (12th), while the Blackhawks‚Äô 3.3 goals (13th) are just‚Ä¶ *meh*. The over/under is 6 goals, but the teams average 6.7 goals per game. Yet, the prediction? *The under*. Because injuries make everyone conservative, apparently.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Injuries, Injuries

The Jets are missing **Dylan Samberg** (wrist) and **Cole Perfetti** (ankle)‚Äîboth forwards. Samberg‚Äôs absence is like losing your favorite coffee‚Äôs foam; it‚Äôs not *gone*, but the experience is diminished. Perfetti‚Äôs ankle injury? A tragedy for his plantar fascia, a relief for defenders.

1ok3xgb,https://i.redd.it/9k5xoo3ww9yf1.jpeg,India's Avocado imports have increased 50x in the past 5 years and it is expected to double this year ü•ë,"#India is seeing a Avocado Boom, from Fancy Guacamole to Daily Toast

Most of us probably tried avocados for the first time as guacamole at a Mexican fast food chain. But post-COVID things have changed.   Indians started eating avocados on toast in salads, smoothies, or just plain.


#INDIA spent  just minimcal ‚Çπ250cr to Import about 12000 tonnes of avocadoes in FY 25. ‚è´

Other key datas - 

1. üáÆüá≥ Is 80%+ on  Import Dependent ‚Äì Most of our avocados come from Tanzania, Peru, and New Zealand. Imports really took off only after 2017.


2. Domestic Cultivation is New ‚Äì Avocados have been around since the 1900s in India, but commercial farming started only about 5 years ago, mainly in Coorg and even parts of Punjab (still testing crops).


3. Varieties ‚Äì Globally, types like Hass, Fuerte Pinkerton etc, people prefer. India mostly grows Pinkerton or local ones like Arka Coorg Ravi.


4. Global Partnerships ‚Äì Companies like Westfalia Fruits South Africa üáøüá¶ are entering joint ventures with Indian growers, especially around the Western Ghats.


5. Big Indian Players Interested ‚Äì Even Tata Coffee is testing avocado cultivation in its coffee estates!



There is barely any detailed data online ‚Äî it‚Äôs still a very young industry. But early reports say Indian grown avocados are as good as imported ones in size and nutrition.

What‚Äôs fascinating is how fast demand took off after COVID. No one knows the exact reason,  maybe a mix of health consciousness, influencer culture, and global food trends  but the shift looks permanent.

#We'll still import some premium avocados like California Hass, but with all this activity and local experimentation, India could replace a big chunk of imports within the next decade.

We have two high school kids that help out for a couple hours on the weekends but that‚Äôs it. My coworker and I were both hired as bakers, and have been fighting since hired to be given tips since we are expected to not only run the whole kitchen but also work up front making coffees and helping customers. After finding out I was looking for other jobs my boss suddenly remembered she wanted to give us tips. But the way she disburses the tips is really odd. She pools all the tips for the week and gives everyone a small percentage and takes the rest. For example, this became a noticeable problem because the other baker and myself were the only ones working on a Sunday for the whole day. Square told us on the app that combined we made $140 in tips that day, cut to the following day it now says we each got $10 in tips. I asked the boss about this and she said that we only are allowed to get a certain percentage of that total tips that week and she goes in and has to manually change it every day. So from what she said, we get a percentage, and then she and the two high school kids also get a percentage of it even though they weren‚Äôt working that day. Boss says that we‚Äôre lucky to be getting tips and that they are a bonus and we aren‚Äôt entitled to the tips we made that day, followed by basically saying if I bring it up again she‚Äôll take tips away completely.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

As annoying as Brenay is, her content was a lot more engaging when she was with Devon! What happened to the dancing videos, nail tutorials, mukbangs, iced coffee videos, and so on? I personally think she was able to be herself more around Devon. Even though he seemed depressed & wasn't perfect, I think he actually loved her, which made her feel comfortable to just do whatever she wanted. 

With Tim, I think he would be embarrassed to see Brenay doing those dances where her chest was all up in the camera. Back then, we would see her burp like a truck driver and act a bit sloppy at times‚Äîwearing no wig, having a bonnet on, and no makeup with her eyes looking bulged. Now, she rarely shows that side of herself because Tim runs a tight ship and she knows he would be on her ass if she did! Remember when she was smacking her food and Tim told her to cut that out? 

Whenever she posts a video of them and there's any talking involved, he's always telling her to stop being disrespectful or not to call him ""bro"" and things like that! Tim seems to be the one controlling the relationship, even though he doesn't have the money. It's insane that Brenay is allegedly in jail this week but Tim was just asking about going on trips a few days before! Tim is very, very smart.

1ok3jp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ok3jp9/i_41m_am_torn_between_compassion_and/,I [41M] am torn between compassion and self-preservation after an emergency protective order against my partner [39F],"Hi everyone. I was going to post this in relationship\_advice but I needed to be able to explain a bit more, so I‚Äôm posting here.

I‚Äôm 41M, my partner‚Äôs 39F. We‚Äôve been back together for a few years, but we actually dated when we were 17 and 18. It always felt like unfinished business, and we would randomly reach out over the years. After both of our divorces, we found each other again, and it honestly felt like fate gave us another chance. When things were good, they were really good. We could talk for hours, laugh over the dumbest things, and we‚Äôre aligned on a lot of the important stuff. I also know we truly care for each other.

But over time her triggers have gotten worse. I journal a lot and have written about many of our hard moments, and lately those moments have been happening more often. About six months ago she was arrested after an argument, and her ex used that situation to take her kids away. She hasn‚Äôt seen them since, and that loss has crushed her while likely fueling the intensity of things between us too.

Then in September there was an incident while my own kids were at the house. Chairs and plates were thrown, and after that I made sure my boys weren‚Äôt around when things felt unstable. When I have them, I would stay at my parents instead. That was when I drew a line and told her that for us to keep trying, she needed to be in consistent therapy. She did start an intensive program and was diagnosed with complex PTSD from her previous abusive marriage of 17 years.

Even with that, it‚Äôs been hard. I‚Äôve got two little boys from my first marriage, and it‚Äôs started feeling like I‚Äôm always trying to keep peace in two places at once. This week, things escalated again when I was leaving to see my kids. She panicked, begged me not to go, and her abandonment trigger took over. It got bad enough that I called 911. An emergency protective order was filed and she was arrested. Since then, I haven‚Äôt seen or spoken to her. Up until that night, we were still living together and I truly thought we were trying to make it work. It‚Äôs been a shock.

Even though I know it‚Äôs taking a toll on me emotionally, I‚Äôve always tried to stand by her and help her through the hardest moments because I know what‚Äôs underneath all that fear. This wasn‚Äôt the first time things went too far. Arguments can turn destructive, and then later when we would discuss it, the situations would get minimized and lowered from what actually took place, that for me, It makes it hard to heal. Sometimes she‚Äôll say something different later that doesn‚Äôt match what‚Äôs on our cameras or recordings, and it leaves me confused, wondering if I‚Äôm being too sensitive, which I think about most nights.

She‚Äôs never really been alone. She married young, went straight from that into our relationship, and since her ex restricted her time with her kids, she‚Äôs lost almost everything that gave her stability. I helped her get legal help, stood by her after her earlier arrest, and did everything I could to be in her corner. Now I‚Äôm sitting in peace at home and she‚Äôs alone in a hotel, and I feel guilty about it.

During the last incident this week after I had already called 911, she was so terrified of getting in trouble again that she said something about telling the police a version of events that wasn‚Äôt true which would have made me the aggressor. When I reminded her about the cameras and audio, she broke down and apologized, saying she was just desperate in the moment. That scared me because it showed how far her fear can push her.

My lawyer wants to move forward, serve the divorce at her work, and try to extend the order past the 91 days. I keep hesitating because my heart hasn‚Äôt caught up to all of this. Part of me believes that if we both do the work, maybe one day we could try again. But I‚Äôm scared that if I take that space, I‚Äôll lose her completely. I‚Äôm also scared that if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll keep putting her healing above mine and my kids‚Äô. I know the depth and complexity of who she is at her core, and I believe the chaos comes from the damage left behind by her past. But trying to help her remove all that pain has made me completely lose myself.

I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist for a few months now, and she believes I‚Äôm trauma bonded after years of these emotional highs and lows. I can see the pattern and I‚Äôm trying to be honest about it, but it doesn‚Äôt make the feelings stop. I miss her even through all the pain, and then I get these waves of calm at home that feel like peace, and I don‚Äôt know what to do with that.

One of the hardest parts of this is the protective order and knowing that the legal side could affect her job and her ability to see her kids. I don‚Äôt want that for her. In a perfect world, I wish I could just tell her we both need a year apart, I‚Äôd focus on therapy and my boys, she could keep healing and rebuilding, and maybe we could meet again one day for coffee, healthier versions of ourselves. But I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs realistic.¬† If I don‚Äôt drop the charges against her though, she will lose her job, likely lose her kids even more and truly have nothing.¬† I can‚Äôt be the one to do that to her when I see past the outside destruction.

My questions:

1. How do I let go of someone I still care about when the relationship has gotten this unstable?
2. How do I handle the guilt of knowing she‚Äôs alone and struggling when I‚Äôm the one in our home and she‚Äôs in a hotel?
3. Is it realistic to hold on to the idea of maybe trying again later if we both actually heal, or am I just keeping myself stuck?

TL;DR: 41M, partner 39F. Long history and strong bond, but her triggers and escalations led to an incident where I called 911 and an emergency protective order was filed. My lawyer wants to finalize and extend the order. I still love and worry about her but I also want peace and to protect my kids. How do I move forward without feeling like I‚Äôm abandoning her, and is it realistic to hope for a later reconnection?",0,1761839852.0,relationships,3,0.5,False

How do I let go?,"I (32F) got involved with a somewhat older and very successful man (43M) who works in the same industry as me. He‚Äôs well known and respected, which made the connection feel exciting and validating at first. I met him at a professional event and asked for advice about my career. He was friendly and generous, said we should grab coffee, and asked for my number so his assistant could set it up. At that time, my ask was strictly professional. I didn't have any romantic or physical attraction to him.

Over the next month, he kept rescheduling our Zoom calls, then started texting me directly. At first, the messages were light and friendly. Then it became every day, small check-ins. Like asking about my day. How my workout was. How my evening was going. Was I looking forward to my next gig in NYC. It all seemed very innocent on the surface, but I felt there was more going on. However, I didn't want to assume.

When I came back to NYC for work, he insisted we have dinner. It was storming that night, so he invited me to his place to order in. I was nervous but agreed. The night started off light, but there was tension building between us. He‚Äôd touch my leg when making a point or hold eye contact a little too long. I finally asked if there was something happening between us, and he acted confused. He said he was just a friendly person, and it was common for him to ""touch"" his friends. I remember feeling embarrassed and said maybe I should just go. That‚Äôs when he suddenly asked if I wanted to have sex with him. I hesitated and said ‚Äúmaybe.‚Äù He asked again, and when I said ‚Äúyes,‚Äù he kissed me. Things escalated quickly. He became very passionate, almost like he had been holding back for weeks. It felt intense and disorienting.

After that, we started seeing each other, and it got confusing fast. He introduced a ‚ÄúDaddy/baby‚Äù dynamic that I didn‚Äôt ask for but went along with. He could be warm and affectionate, then distant or cruel. He would encourage me in my career and offer really great advice. He'd check-in on me, congratulate me, express how proud he was of me. How beautiful he thought I was and how intelligent I was. But he also yelled at me, accused me of ‚Äúvictimizing‚Äù myself when I cried, and made degrading jokes about things we had done. He also crossed physical boundaries in ways that scared me, like grabbing my face when I spoke during an argument. He told me I made him act the way he did. That I was pulling it out of him, making him act ""not like himself"", and that his ego was too big to deal with me. It was emotionally exhausting and ruined some of my confidence.

I finally blocked him a few weeks ago after he told me he was ‚Äúdone with me‚Äù during an argument, then started texting me again like nothing happened. Going no contact has helped a bit, but I still feel hooked emotionally and physically. Everyone else sees him as this brilliant, admired person, and I feel like I met someone completely different.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Especially when the person had power or influence? How do I let go and stop questioning myself?

The lich, Archmagus Velorin the Undying, looked particularly miserable for someone who no longer had facial muscles. ‚ÄúMy entire crypt fund was transferred to something called ‚ÄòCryptoCryptCoin.‚Äô I thought it was necromancy-related. It is not.‚Äù

The dragon groaned. ‚ÄúThey tricked you again?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey said it was endorsed by the Reaper himself!‚Äù

‚ÄúVelorin, you are the Reaper on weekends.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but I thought it was a sponsorship deal!‚Äù

Before Toothgnasher could reply, the call finally connected. ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù chirped a chipper voice. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve reached DragonBank‚Äôs magical support department! My name is Trevor. Can I start by verifying your hoard name and secret phrase?‚Äù

‚ÄúEternal Flamebringer. Secret phrase: May the skies burn forever,‚Äù Toothgnasher growled.

‚ÄúPerfect! And, uh, can I confirm your date of hatching?‚Äù

‚ÄúSix thousand years before your species crawled from the mud.‚Äù

Trevor hesitated. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt have that on the calendar drop-down. Could you narrow it down to a fiscal quarter?‚Äù

There was a long, dangerous silence. Smoke trickled from the dragon‚Äôs nostrils. ‚ÄúPut your manager on the line.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Velorin scrolled through his phone with bony fingers. ‚ÄúLook here, they‚Äôve set up a support group for beings like us. ‚ÄòAncients Anonymous.‚Äô Weekly meetings, free coffee, Wi-Fi password included.‚Äù

Toothgnasher raised a brow ridge. ‚ÄúWi-Fi? You think I can trust magic I can‚Äôt even see?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour entire hoard is digital now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich is why I‚Äôm being robbed digitally!‚Äù

Still, curiosity ‚Äî and boredom ‚Äî got the better of him. That evening, they both attended the meeting.

It was held in the basement of a converted church, now called the ‚ÄúSanctuary of Adaptation.‚Äù Folding chairs formed a circle. A sign near the refreshments table read Please refrain from consuming the volunteers.

‚ÄúWelcome, everyone!‚Äù said a fairy no taller than a teacup, hovering above a tablet that displayed her notes. ‚ÄúTonight‚Äôs topic is: recognizing phishing scams.‚Äù

A minotaur in a suit raised his hand. ‚ÄúIs it phishing if the message comes from Poseidon?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the fairy. ‚ÄúEspecially if he asks for your mother‚Äôs maiden name.‚Äù

The group murmured in sympathy. Toothgnasher shifted uncomfortably in his chair, which creaked in mortal terror. Beside him, Velorin attempted to download the meeting‚Äôs PowerPoint on his phone. ‚ÄúIt says I need to update my OS,‚Äù he muttered.

‚ÄúOperating spell?‚Äù asked Toothgnasher.

‚ÄúOperating system.‚Äù

‚ÄúSame thing.‚Äù

When it was Toothgnasher‚Äôs turn to speak, he stood up ‚Äî towering over everyone ‚Äî and cleared his throat. ‚ÄúGreetings. I am Toothgnasher the Eternal Flamebringer. I was once feared across ten kingdoms. Now I have been tricked by a ‚ÄòPrince of Nigeria.‚Äô‚Äù

A sympathetic gasp rippled through the group.

‚ÄúHe promised me access to a hidden vault if I transferred a small fee,‚Äù Toothgnasher continued, scales glinting with shame. ‚ÄúI thought it was tribute. It was not.‚Äù

A troll across the circle nodded. ‚ÄúHappened to me last week. Lost an entire bridge to ransomware.‚Äù

Velorin raised his hand. ‚ÄúAt least they contacted you by email. I was hacked through a summoning circle. Do you know how humiliating it is to appear in someone‚Äôs living room against your will?‚Äù

The fairy facilitator smiled patiently. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, everyone. The first step is admitting we‚Äôve been targeted. The second step is learning to protect ourselves. Remember: never click mysterious links, never give away true names, and‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄîNever trust anything that starts with ‚ÄòDear Esteemed Overlord,‚Äô‚Äù Toothgnasher finished bitterly.

They all nodded in solemn agreement.

By the end of the meeting, the dragon and lich felt‚Ä¶ oddly lighter. The fairy handed out pamphlets titled Digital Literacy for the Undying. Toothgnasher tucked his copy carefully under a claw.

As they left, Velorin looked thoughtful. ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúperhaps we could start our own hotline ‚Äî for ancients, by ancients. Help others avoid the same mistakes.‚Äù

The dragon rumbled with interest. ‚ÄúA scam-protection business?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. We could call it WyrmShield Tech Support.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm.‚Äù Toothgnasher grinned, sharp teeth gleaming in the moonlight. ‚ÄúFinally, a hoard worth guarding.‚Äù

A week later, their new enterprise was booming. Beings from all over ‚Äî vampires who couldn‚Äôt navigate two-factor authentication, sphinxes locked out of their riddling apps, even a kraken who‚Äôd accidentally bought a cruise ship ‚Äî called for help.

Toothgnasher sat proudly at his custom-made desk, headset perched on one horn. ‚ÄúYes, madam hydra, I see the problem,‚Äù he said into the mic. ‚ÄúNo, you shouldn‚Äôt give your credit-card number to anyone promising head-regrowth cream.‚Äù

Across the room, Velorin‚Äôs skeletal fingers flew across the keyboard. ‚ÄúAnother breach attempt!‚Äù he called. ‚ÄúSomeone posing as us!‚Äù

‚ÄúAlready?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! They‚Äôre calling themselves True WyrmShield Tech Support and demanding tribute payments.‚Äù

Toothgnasher sighed, rubbing his temples. ‚ÄúThe mortals are quick learners.‚Äù

He leaned back, eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúPerhaps it‚Äôs time we return to the old ways.‚Äù

Velorin grinned, the sockets of his skull glowing faintly. ‚ÄúFire and brimstone?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù

And somewhere in a sleek office tower miles away, a scammer‚Äôs laptop began to smoke.",1,1761839205.0,JuliaWestAuthor,0,1.0,False

**Me:** foodie, big on neighborhoods and wandering, not trying to see every temple.

I keep seeing every itinerary critiqued as too busy so I'm trying to keep it a bit sparse.

# Plan at a glance

**Apr 25‚Äì29 ‚Äì Okinawa (Rosewood)**  
Mostly chill. Open to off-resort half-day ideas near the hotel (great beaches, scenic drives, easy food stops, low-effort snorkeling, local markets, live music bars).

**Apr 29 ‚Äì Kyoto (arrive \~5pm, Mitsui)**

* Check-in, stroll, **shopping + dinner** nearby.

**Apr 30 ‚Äì Kyoto**

* **Early**: Fushimi Inari (hike partway up before crowds)
* **Afternoon**: Nishiki Market 
* **Evening**: dinner + a walk (Pontocho/Gion area?)

**May 1 ‚Äì Kyoto ‚Üí Arashiyama ‚Üí depart for Tokyo**

* Morning: **Arashiyama** (bamboo grove early, river area)
* Afternoon/Evening: Shinkansen to Tokyo

**May 2 ‚Äì Tokyo (Prince Gallery Kioicho)**

* Explore **Akasaka/Kioicho** area and dinner

**May 3 ‚Äì Tokyo**

* **Shibuya/Harajuku** day
* **teamLab** (Borderless @ Azabudai Hills or Planets @ Toyosu) in the evening

**May 4 ‚Äì Tokyo**

* **Shinjuku** \+ **baseball game** (open which day/night works best)

**May 5 ‚Äì Tokyo**

* **Ginza / Marunouchi** (shopping, caf√©s, dinner)

**May 6 ‚Äì Tokyo**

* **Asakusa / Ueno** (old-Tokyo vibe + museums/park)

**May 7 ‚Äì Depart**

  
How's this all look? We love fine dining and shopping so any recommendations would be lovely!

  


# Food & shopping vibe

* I‚Äôm into **neighborhood gems** over Michelin checklists. Love coffee, pastries, yakitori/izakaya, and fun shopping streets (boutiques, vintage, outdoors/techwear, home goods).
* If you have **can‚Äôt-miss streets/arcades** in each area (Kyoto + Tokyo neighborhoods above), drop them.

  


**Thanks in advance.** Biggest things I want sanity-checked are: Golden Week crowd traps, order of Kyoto days, whether my Tokyo groupings make sense from **Kioicho**, and easy off-resort wins in **Okinawa**.

1ok38tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/visitingnyc/comments/1ok38tb/one_week_trip_report/,One week Trip Report,"Hi guys, so I just finished my one week trip in NYC and wanted to share how it went. I posted here before my trip saying how anxious I was getting and worried that I will get overwhelmed. I travelled quite a lot but it was my first time in the US and I was travelling as a solo female too. I want to thank everyone who gave me advice and support on how to navigate the city and not get too overwhelmed üôè‚ù§Ô∏è

First of all, I want to say how nice and helpful everyone were to me, be it cafe or station staff, people on the streets when I asked for directions (some were rude and dismissive but the majority were really nice and helpful). My American friends warned me that people in New York are really rude and to not bother anyone on the streets so I was glad I was proven wrong. 
There were times when some people couldn't understand me well because I speak British English so after a couple days I tried using more American English. Like when I asked for a room with a bath at the hotel the reception guy said 'bed?'? I said no, a bath, then he said 'tub'? And I was like yes, that's what a bath is üòÖ

I wanted to see and visit many places but ended up not being able to see as much as I wanted which made me feel disappointed in myself, but I didn't want to tire myself out too much and on some days I chose to sleep in for longer to properly recharge. Also the city is huge and the weather was lovely so I chose to walk to many places which obviously tired me out even more üòÖ 

Some notable places I went to were:
- Museum of New York City History, which was so great! Really recommend it to anyone who is interested in history. I spent three hours there and it was all worth it.
- MoMa, a place which was my number one museum I wanted to go to and it didn't disappoint. They had art ranging from the 19th century till now. Also spent about three hours here.
- Central Park. I think I walked through most of the park and my feet were killing me afterwards, but it was worth seeing the beginning of the autumn leaves change and be in nature when the weather was so nice and warm.
- 9/11 Memorial place. A peaceful and beautiful place. Was one of the first places I went to on my first couple days which was a great option as it was calm and not as packed with people.
- Central Station. Absolutely gorgeous. I saw this place in so many of my favourite films and shows and to see it in real life with my own eyes was deeply inspiring. 

I also walked around Times Square, saw the Empire State building, Rockefeller Center and the Art Deco buildings around the area, took the Staten Island Ferry. Had delicious New York pizza slices, rainbow bagel, great coffee.
Took the hop and off bus and for me it was a great option to see the bigger part of the city and also from higher above. It helped me decide where I want to go and walk around again.

I also wanted to do some shopping but I actually was overwhelmed by the stores and their sizes (like Macy's was too much for me), and I'm not familiar with the local brands as much so wasn't sure where is a good place to go for affordable shopping. So instead I went to Target and bought snacks and sweets for myself and family, and went to CVS to get some supplements. 

So I wish I could've done more but I hope that for a first timer this is acceptable üòÖ

Just want to share my experience, just in case anyone needs that push to go for it.

In high school, there was this cute guy who was new to our school, and every girl found him attractive. So did I, so what I did was write my phone number on a piece of paper and say, ‚ÄúText me.‚Äù He ended up texting me, and we dated for a few months.

During my freshman year of college, I saw this cute guy in my Speech 101 class, and I decided to email him through Blackboard and told him we should ‚Äúpractice‚Äù our presentations together. We met up and went on dates, but it didn‚Äôt go anywhere because he moved to a different state after the semester ended.

After that, I saw another cute guy on campus, built up the courage, and told him I thought he was cute and that we should go out sometime. He rejected me and told me that he had just recently broken up with his ex. A year later, he saw me while I was out getting some coffee, and we ended up dating for 2 years.

My point is that I have no regrets. I saw someone that I liked, and I made it known. I was hoping I would hear back from this old coworker, but I didn‚Äôt at least now I get to move on and continue living my life with no regrets.

So this whole mess started six months ago. I work in marketing and my boss was always really charming, funny, made me feel special. We started staying late together, grabbing drinks after work, texting constantly. I told myself it was just friendship but deep down I knew what I was doing. I knew.

My husband works construction, comes home exhausted every day, and honestly we'd gotten into a rut. Same dinner conversations, same routines. When my boss started giving me attention it felt exciting again. Like I mattered.

One night I told my husband I had to work late on a big presentation. He just nodded, didn't question it. I met my boss at a bar instead. We were drinking, laughing, and I forgot I'd left my location sharing on. My husband called around 9pm.

I stepped outside to answer. He said, ""Hey, just checking in. You still at the office?""

I said yes. He went quiet for a second.

Then he said, ""Funny, because your location shows you at a bar downtown. And I can hear you laughing in the background on your Instagram story.""

My stomach dropped. I stammered something about the team going out after finishing the project. He didn't raise his voice. He just said, ""Keep her. She's your problem now,"" and hung up.

I called back immediately. He didn't answer. I drove home in a panic and when I got there at 11pm, half his stuff was already packed. He was throwing clothes into garbage bags.

I started crying, begging him to let me explain. He looked at me like I was a stranger. He said, ""There's nothing to explain. You lied to my face and I heard you having the time of your life with him. That's all I need to know.""

I grabbed his arm and he pulled away. He said, ""Don't touch me. I'm done.""

He slept at his brother's that night. I kept texting, calling, apologizing. He responded once: ""My lawyer will contact you.""

I legitimately thought he was being dramatic. That he'd cool off in a few days and we'd talk it through. We'd been together for eight years, married for five. People don't just throw that away.

But he filed for divorce that week. And then his family got involved.

His mother called me and tore me apart. She said I was trash, that her son deserved better, that she always knew I wasn't good enough for him. His sister posted on social media, didn't name me directly but everyone knew. She wrote about women who betray good men and how they always play victim when consequences come.

Then his brother sent screenshots of my texts with my boss to my entire family group chat. I don't know how he got them, maybe my husband had logged into my laptop before. But suddenly my parents, my siblings, my aunts and uncles, everyone saw the flirty messages, the plans to meet up, everything.

My dad called me and said he was ashamed. My mom cried on the phone asking where they went wrong raising me. My brother told me not to contact him until I sorted my life out.

My boss backed off immediately when things got messy. Turns out he has a wife and kids. He told me we needed to keep things professional and stopped responding to my messages.

The divorce was final last month. My husband got the house because I couldn't afford the mortgage alone and he had proof of my affair which made me look terrible in court. I'm renting a studio apartment now. My friends stopped inviting me places because most of them were our mutual friends and they sided with him.

I saw him last week at a coffee shop with someone new. She was laughing at something he said. He looked happy. He saw me, gave a polite nod, and turned back to her like I didn't exist.

I've been sitting here replaying everything in my head. I genuinely believed he'd forgive me eventually, that his family would calm down, that we'd find our way back. But I torched everything and there's no coming back from it.

Am I wrong for thinking his family took it too far by exposing me to everyone I know?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1ok32hx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ok32hx/aita_for_confronting_my_husband_about_possibly/,AITA for confronting my husband about possibly being addicted to porn because he won‚Äôt have sex with me?,"

I (32F) have been married to my husband (34M) for 7 years. There‚Äôs a lot of love and friendship in my relationship, he‚Äôs my best friend and I am his.

There is love and pleasantness between us (he makes me coffee every morning) but he just doesn‚Äôt seem to want me sexually. I feel like I have become invisible to him in that way.

I asked him if something was wrong and after some hesitation he said:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just hard to be in a sexual mood with someone who doesn‚Äôt take care of themselves.‚Äù

I have gained about 35 lbs since we got married. And I‚Äôve been buried in my research thesis this past year so no I haven‚Äôt been as consistent about waxing, shaving, or doing my nails. But I still shower, wear clean clothes, do my hair most days, and try to look somewhat put-together. I‚Äôm not depressed or neglecting myself but I guess that‚Äôs not ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù for him anymore or is it?

Anyway I made a post a few weeks ago (not on this account) about the situation asking for advice about feeling unwanted. A lot of women commented that their husbands acted the same way when they were secretly addicted to porn. They said it drains sexual energy and rewires attraction.

So I confronted him about it last night. I said, ‚ÄúAre you sure this isn‚Äôt about porn? Maybe that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre not interested in me anymore.‚Äù

He laughed at me. My question to him looked like it amused him. He said ‚ÄúOh, is that the story you‚Äôre trying to tell yourself?‚Äù

I felt burned in that moment. I stood there feeling small and stupid. He didn‚Äôt shout or insult me but I felt humiliated. I felt ashamed for even asking something like that to him. I started crying and said, ‚ÄúThat was really hurtful,‚Äù and he just said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way but I don‚Äôt watch porn and never wanted to ever since we got together‚Äù 

However despite him being truthful it didn‚Äôt help me feel okay. 
Was I completely out of line for confronting him like that?
Did I deserve that kind of response?
Or was it just unnecessarily cruel to laugh and dismiss me like that when he knows how insecure I‚Äôve been feeling?

I want him to apologise to me but don‚Äôt want to force it. However it hurts me to know that he doesn‚Äôt think this is something he needs to apologise for.

I just came home from a big family get‚Äëtogether at my aunt‚Äôs house in a rich suburb. We all love the big house, the turkey and the football games in the backyard.

The problem is my cousin G. He‚Äôs in his late twenties, autistic, childfree and he never wants to do anything. He just sits on the couch, eats snacks, watches TV and makes rude comments about everyone. He never helps with the dishes, he never brings his own food, he even steals food off other people‚Äôs plates.

Everyone in the family makes excuses for him. Aunt Pearl tried to give him a plate of food and said he should ‚Äújoin the others.‚Äù He just said he was ‚Äújust existing.‚Äù She laughed and walked away.

My sister Em brought G another plate and said he needed help because he‚Äôs autistic. I told Em that he‚Äôs not a dog and can get his own food. Em rolled her eyes and said he needs help.

Then Uncle R walked in and asked what was happening. I pointed at G on the couch and said he was acting like a spoiled brat and that everyone keeps enabling him. Uncle R said G can‚Äôt help it because he‚Äôs autistic. I said he is an adult and can help himself. I told him that using autism as an excuse is easier than holding him accountable.

Aunt C tried to defend G. She said we have to support him because he has challenges. I told her that G is a grown man and that we should not let him act like a child. Aunt C sighed and said we need to support him. I left the kitchen muttering that ‚Äúsupporting‚Äù him means letting him be a lazy brat.

Later I saw G steal a piece of pie from Uncle R‚Äôs plate. Mom gave him a fresh plate of food. I thought about how the whole family was just making excuses.

Finally I walked up to G, who had his feet up on the coffee table, and told him he needed to act like a grown man. He looked at me and said he was acting like a grown man but not the way I wanted. I told him he was acting like a spoiled brat and that it was time to change. I walked away feeling a little proud.

After I left, I realized the rest of the family was still making excuses for G. I decided I would not enable him any more. I promised myself I would call him out even if the rest of the family stays silent.",0,1761838723.0,AITAH,15,0.38,False

Why Human-Centric Social Marketing Works


People Follow People, Not Logos
Ever notice how some random personal account gets more engagement than a big brand? That‚Äôs because people trust people. Show the faces behind the brand, share stories, and be relatable.
Example: A local coffee shop owner I follow posts daily ‚Äúcoffee chats‚Äù with customers. His engagement is through the roof‚Äînot because of ads, but because he‚Äôs present.



Engagement > Reach
100 loyal followers who comment and share are worth more than 10K silent ones. Ask questions, run polls, and actually respond to replies. It‚Äôs a conversation, not a broadcast.



Authenticity Beats Perfection
You don‚Äôt need a fancy studio or professional edits. A shaky behind-the-scenes video often performs better than a polished ad because it feels real.



It‚Äôs a Feedback Loop
Social media isn‚Äôt just for posting‚Äîit‚Äôs for listening. What are people complaining about? What do they love? Use that intel to improve.



Community Over Customers
The goal isn‚Äôt just to sell‚Äîit‚Äôs to create a tribe. When people feel like they belong, they stick around (and bring friends).



How to Shift Your Mindset
Stop chasing virality. Chase meaningful interactions instead.
Be helpful, not salesy. Share tips, answer questions, and solve problems.
Show up consistently. Not just when you have something to promote.

## The Good ‚òïÔ∏è
- **Return to Growth:** Starbucks posted its first quarter of global comparable sales growth (1%) in 7 quarters, signaling the turnaround is taking hold.
- **Global Revenue Up:** Q4 consolidated revenue rose 5% year-over-year to $9.6 billion.

- **Partner Engagement:** Employee (partner) turnover at record lows, engagement up, and customer service scores improving.

---

## The Bad üò¨

- **Operating Margin Pressure:** Q4 consolidated operating margin dropped 500bps to 9.4%, driven by inflation, tariffs, and labor investments.
- **EPS Down:** Q4 EPS of $0.52, down 34% versus prior year, reflecting higher costs and investments in turnaround efforts.

- **Ongoing Commodity Headwinds:** Coffee prices remain elevated, continuing to pressure margins.
- **Restructuring and Impairment Charges:** GAAP results include restructuring and impairment charges, litigation settlements, and transaction costs.
- **Slower Turnaround in U.S.:** The turnaround in the U.S. is slow, especially in the afternoon and midday segments, though morning is stabilizing.

---

## The Ugly üò¨‚òïÔ∏è
- **Seven Quarters of Negative Comps:** This was the first positive comps quarter after 6 consecutive negative ones‚Äîhighlighting how deep the hole was.
- **Significant Margin Dilution:** The 500bps margin contraction is notable, and recovery will take time even as comps improve.
- **Unprofitable Stores:** Store closures were driven by locations unable to meet customer experience or profitability standards‚Äîindicative of missteps in site selection or management.
- **Turnaround Not Linear:** Management cautioned that recovery ‚Äúis not always linear,‚Äù and that earnings will lag top line for the foreseeable future.
- **Ongoing Cost Uncertainty:** Coffee and labor costs remain unpredictable; margin recovery is not guaranteed in the short term.
- **Guidance Deferred:** No specific fiscal 2026 guidance given‚Äîdetails pushed to January‚Äôs Investor Day, creating near-term uncertainty for investors.

We were good friends before we started dating and have talked about moving in together, we've met each other's families, and have discussed being together long term. Things between us have been great. I have been going through lots of personal/family matters, and he's aware of it.

Now for what's been happening: My partner was hooking up with this girl ~2.5-3 years ago. He really, really liked her and wanted to date her. She ended the fling. I knew about this because we were friends before we began dating, so he'd been open with me about their relationship.

A month ago, we found out she is moved to the same city as us. He has ALWAYS given me the impression that he wants nothing to do with her and that their relationship ended somewhat poorly. It was my surprise then, when he asked me if he should text her, congratulate her on her new job, and get ""closure."" He said it wasn't romantic closure, but rather to ensure that things between them were good and it wouldn't be awkward if they ran into each other. He said he had no intention of maintaining a relationship/friendship with her after. I was on board with congratulating her and honestly thought that would imply everything years ago was water under the bridge. The additional conversation about friendship closure seemed unnecessary to me, but I reluctantly said that would be okay too. Then, he said he might also grab a coffee with her. At this point, I didn't feel good about it and felt coffee would be disrespectful to me. I wanted to be honest about how I felt so I very clearly communicated that this would cross a boundary worse than anything else with a previous romantic partner ever would (except literal cheating) and he said he would respect my boundaries and wouldn't push them.
The next day, we had an additional conversation about it. My therapist told me I should be honest to him about how I feel, but not TELL him what to do, so I didn't. I was emotional and crying, explaining him that I was uncomfortable with it, etc.

The day after that was my family member's funeral. I was out of the state, obviously having a very difficult day. The funeral was long and grueling and emotionally draining. During lunch break, he tells me he texted her and they made plans to get coffee. I literally felt my heart shatter. On top of my boundaries being crossed, I was at a funeral and needed his support that day more than anything. I told him that night that I was seriously betrayed and that this was enough to make me want to end the relationship. He was shocked and dumbfounded that this would jeopardize us, and I was dumbfounded that he thought it wouldn't. He explained that he didn't know this was a ""hard"" boundary and thought I would be uncomfortable, but that things would be okay. I told him that they can still get coffee (what's done is done), but if he wanted to have a relationship with her I would be done. He said that he understood.

(EDIT: I‚Äôm back in town at this point)
Cut to the end of the week and they actually end up getting coffee. He tells me it was ""pleasant"" and ""nice"" and that she is a really nice and friendly person and it was nice to talk about their similar fields of work. He also gave her a ride to her next destination (but didn't tell me until 2 days later, because he knew it would upset me...yet did it anyway?). I was honestly so heartbroken and needed to be away from him for some time. As I'm having some time away from him, he says he wants to text her to say they can't be friends because it would make me uncomfortable. I acknowledge I should have been happy about this, but in the moment heard that he was admitting he wanted a friendship with her. I asked him, and he said that coffee was so nice and she was so friendly that he realized a friendship with her would be nice. So I stuck by my word and broke up with him.

Not going to get into details but basically we were both pretty miserable and have been talking and trying to make things work. It's been a few weeks and I'm going to therapy and trying to get over it, but I have so much anger and hurt built up? I don't know how to move on and to a degree feel like I was emotionally cheated on. I feel like I was a second choice throughout all of this and that he chose her comfort (being in the same city and it not being awkward) over mine. The funeral aspect is also not negligible to me and I think crossing boundaries on a day of a fucking funeral is nuts tbh.

He has been very apologetic and remorseful. He regrets texting her. He tells me he does not need to see her ever again and will prioritize my comfort in the future. But all that already happened! The worst part is over! So I'm struggling. I love him a lot and want to make things work, but it's been a few weeks at this point and I'm still so hurt and angry about it. I don't know how I could have been clearer about my boundaries. How am I supposed to move on or forgive him?",1,1761838512.0,relationship_advice,6,0.67,False

Conventional medicine focuses mostly on managing symptoms with antiviral drugs, but few talk about restoring the body‚Äôs natural ability to heal. This is where the late Dr. Sebi‚Äôs approach stands out. His teachings were rooted in the belief that the human body can heal itself when it‚Äôs in an alkaline state‚Äîfree from excess mucus and toxins.

The question many ask is: **Can Dr. Sebi‚Äôs methods really help cure herpes?** Let‚Äôs explore what his approach involves, why it has gained so much attention, and how people today are using it to find relief naturally.

# Understanding Dr. Sebi‚Äôs Philosophy and the Herpes Connection

Dr. Sebi believed that all diseases, including herpes, thrive in an acidic environment. His concept was simple: when the body becomes too acidic due to processed foods, animal products, and stress, it creates the perfect breeding ground for viruses and inflammation.

His **alkaline diet** focuses on removing mucus-causing foods and replacing them with nutrient-rich natural plants, herbs, and alkaline water. According to Sebi‚Äôs philosophy:

* Disease cannot survive in an alkaline body.
* Mucus buildup is the root cause of most illnesses.
* The body heals itself when it is clean and mineral-rich.

This holistic idea may not align with traditional Western medicine, but many people who follow the Dr. Sebi herpes cure approach claim improved energy, clearer skin, and fewer outbreaks.

# Step-by-Step Daily Routine for Dr. Sebi‚Äôs Herpes Healing Plan

If you‚Äôre curious about trying Dr. Sebi‚Äôs method, it‚Äôs important to follow a consistent daily structure. Here‚Äôs a simplified version inspired by his teachings:

1. **Morning Cleansing (6‚Äì8 AM):**
   * Start your day with a glass of warm alkaline water and a few drops of key herbs like burdock root or elderberry.
   * Avoid coffee or processed juice; instead, try fresh fruit like melon or papaya.
2. **Mid-Morning Nourishment (9‚Äì11 AM):**
   * Have a green smoothie with kale, cucumber, and Irish sea moss.
   * Add key alkaline herbs known for detoxification.
3. **Lunch (12‚Äì2 PM):**
   * Eat plant-based meals such as quinoa, mushrooms, and leafy greens.
   * Avoid salt, sugar, and hybrid foods (foods that have been genetically altered).
4. **Evening Detox (6‚Äì8 PM):**
   * Drink herbal teas like chaparral or red clover.
   * End the day with deep breathing or light meditation to lower stress, which can trigger herpes flare-ups.

Additionally, if you are suffering with herpes, I will recommend you to visit **HerpesCureForever. Org**, so far it‚Äôs the best cure available for herpes and follows many of Dr. Sebi‚Äôs holistic principles.

# Expert Recommendations and Modern Insights

While Dr. Sebi‚Äôs approach is rooted in natural wellness, even modern holistic practitioners agree that nutrition, stress management, and detoxification play a key role in managing herpes symptoms. Experts suggest combining traditional wisdom with modern science:

* **Hydration:** Drink at least 2‚Äì3 liters of alkaline or spring water daily.
* **Herbal Support:** Herbs like sarsaparilla, dandelion root, and elderberry support immune health and detoxification.
* **Mind-Body Connection:** Meditation and yoga help reduce stress, which can lower the frequency of outbreaks.

Many integrative doctors today emphasize that when you support your immune system, you create an environment where viruses can‚Äôt thrive‚Äîaligning closely with what Dr. Sebi taught decades ago.

# Nutrition and Lifestyle Factors That Influence Healing

Diet is at the core of the Dr. Sebi herpes cure philosophy. To restore the body‚Äôs balance, focus on **alkaline-rich foods** and eliminate acidic triggers.

**Recommended Alkaline Foods:**

* Avocados, kale, dandelion greens, watercress
* Wild rice, quinoa, amaranth
* Figs, dates, mangoes, and berries
* Herbs like burdock root, bladderwrack, and sea moss

**Foods to Avoid:**

* Meat, dairy, eggs
* White flour, sugar, alcohol
* Processed or canned foods

Small lifestyle changes, like proper sleep, consistent hydration, and moderate sunlight exposure, also help the body regenerate faster.

# Additional Tips and Do‚Äôs & Don‚Äôts

**Do‚Äôs:**

* Keep your immune system strong with consistent nutrition.
* Cleanse your body regularly using natural herbs.
* Stay positive and stress-free‚Äîmental health affects your immune strength.

**Don‚Äôts:**

* Don‚Äôt consume processed or hybrid foods.
* Avoid chemical-based skincare products on outbreaks.
* Don‚Äôt skip rest or ignore emotional stress, as it can trigger flare-ups.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

* **Expecting Overnight Results:** Natural healing takes time. It‚Äôs a journey, not a quick fix.
* **Not Following the Alkaline List:** Eating even small amounts of acidic food can slow your progress.
* **Neglecting Stress Management:** Stress is one of the most overlooked triggers for herpes outbreaks.

A lot of people stop midway because they don‚Äôt see instant changes, but consistency is what transforms your health over time.

# Conclusion: Healing Starts from Within

Dr. Sebi‚Äôs herpes cure philosophy reminds us that true healing begins by restoring the body‚Äôs natural balance. By cleansing, nourishing, and maintaining an alkaline environment, the body can regain its strength to fight off viruses naturally.

\--------------------

I stared at rabbits. Walking upright. Holding weapons. Dressed in colourful togas. They all reminded me of Rabbit from Winnie the Pooh. Except these were taller and more muscular. A couple wore black togas and had a look about them that was not friendly or cute.

\[YOU ARE NOT SEEING RABBITS\]

Eternity‚Äôs deadpan reply ripped a nervous chuckle out of me, especially as three of the things turned my way and brandished long spears. The points looked quite sharp, and the spears were probably several fingers thick. They held the weapons in four-fingered hands that looked straight out of a cartoon.

\[WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ARE CALLED IEPURRANS\]

\[THEY ARE A BIPEDAL SAPIENT SPECIES COMMON TO THIS WORLD\]

\[NORMALLY, THEY FORM PEACEFUL COMMUNITIES\]

\[THEY ARE NOT KNOWN AS AN AGGRESSIVE SPECIES\]

\[HUMANS, HOWEVER, ARE NOT COMMON ON ORESSTRIA #2111\]

\[AND THEY ARE OFTEN AGGRESSIVE\]

A blob of bright light popped into existence by my head, bobbing in the air.

‚ÄúI will communicate for you,‚Äù it said in a low, neutral voice.

I swear to God I nearly crapped myself with the sudden appearance and noise. The only sounds I‚Äôd heard for the past two hours had been my voice, the wind, and the various buzzing insects trying to lay eggs in my ears. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for another voice joining in.

The blob bobbed in the air twice, as if laughing at my sudden shock, then drifted away towards the three guards.

‚ÄúPlease wait here,‚Äù it said as I started following. ‚ÄúYou do not yet possess any insight or community standing. Your appearance can be unnerving to the locals.‚Äù

So, I was indeed a very ugly Alice, and this was a very fucked up version of Wonderland. Or maybe not. I remembered the book and the author must‚Äôve been on hard drugs while writing it, and I doubted my imagination could conjure up anything as weird.

The guards stopped advancing on me and, instead, spoke rapidly with the Eternity blob, their spears still trained my way. Was that actually Eternity, I wondered? It could take a physical form? I hadn‚Äôt asked and it hadn‚Äôt said, true, but it could‚Äôve volunteered the information. Reading messages floating in the air had me almost tripping over my feet more than once on the way down.

The‚Ä¶ iepurrans‚Äô voices sounded a lot like those of angry chinchillas, a series of near barks and squeaks that made absolutely no sense to me. Eternity answered in kind and this exchange went on for some time before the spears were lowered and the three guards stepped aside to let me pass. They looked at me with bright green eyes and pointed me towards the village gate, not making another sound.

The light blob dissipated.

\[YOU MAY PASS\]

\[IF YOU WISH\]

‚ÄúYou can talk?‚Äù I asked, still unsure of what was happening.

\[EVIDENTLY\]

I‚Äôd walked myself into that one. I coughed and tried again, ‚ÄúNot like that. You can have a presence? That light was you?‚Äù

\[AN AUDIO-VISUAL AVATAR, YES\]

‚ÄúCan you, please, use sounds instead of text? It would be more comfortable for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is acceptable,‚Äù the voice spoke in my ear, startling me again. To my credit, I only jumped sideways. A little. And didn‚Äôt trip.

The blob reformed in the air and bobbed around my head.

‚ÄúIs this more comfortable to you?‚Äù it asked in the same neutral tone as before.

‚ÄúMuch. Thank you,‚Äù I said, meaning it.

In my line of work I‚Äôd spent a lot of time with my laptop, arguing loudly with robot arms, electric cabinets, electrovalves, and many other kinds of various wilful automation components. If it didn‚Äôt function as intended, I would spend long periods of time talking to the fucking things until the right approach hit me. I had gathered plenty of odd looks from clients for this habit, and it was one I‚Äôd been trying to break for the past couple of months.

A big automotive client had asked for my psych evaluation after their on-site engineer found me having a full-blown tirade at an ABB robot arm that simply refused to obey my commands. I was on five coffees, two hours of sleep, and three different kinds of cold medication. I hadn‚Äôt checked the wiring to the automation cabinet before getting to work, so I was mostly raging at the proverbial unplugged computer. I came off as deranged.

Having to argue with Eternity‚Äôs texts wasn‚Äôt doing much to help me feel less deranged, so its compliance was comforting.

‚ÄúI just go into the village?‚Äù I asked, still standing there like a complete dunce.

Several other iepurrans passed by, all of them staring at me. Two dragged a flatbed cart filled with vegetables and fruit. Others carried all manners of tools, and I realised they were heading to reap the fields outside the village, going by the scythes, pitchforks, and other farm implements. The road was soon bustling with activity and I had to step out of the way.

‚ÄúYou can go, if you want,‚Äù Eternity answered.

‚ÄúOr I can fuck off back into the hills?‚Äù I asked, my temper rising a bit at its answer.

‚ÄúIf that is what you want, yes.‚Äù

I let out a slow breath and tried again. ‚ÄúWill I get any answers if I go into the village?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is possible, yes,‚Äù came the reply, the voice a patient monotone.

The traffic stared at me. I couldn‚Äôt understand a word they were saying in that odd language of theirs, but I was certain at least a few of the rabb‚Ä¶ iepurrans were amused by the strange creature talking to a glorified light bulb.

‚ÄúYou are not very helpful,‚Äù I said finally as I started towards the gates. The guards watched me pass by, still pointing the way.

‚ÄúI apologise for my limitation.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt hard to note that it didn‚Äôt offer a solution to this, nor an explanation.

Several other guards, similarly armed with spears, caught sight of me and took up the same kind of pointing as the first group. I was barely past the gates, wandering about, when a spear blocked my way. I had meant to head down one of the side streets‚Äîthere was a pleasant smell coming from that direction‚Äîbut one of the guards barred the way. Not roughly, mind you, just very firmly. It pointed down the main thoroughfare, insisting I go that way.

‚ÄúFine, fine, little guy,‚Äù I said, backing up and joining the traffic.

*Little guy* but the iepurran was about as tall as I was. It had shoulders like a bodybuilder and muscles that rippled beneath its fur. Being stared down by something like that was intimidating, so I hurried to obey.

This wasn‚Äôt so much a village as a kind of small, spread out town. Once past the gates, the roads were built of cubic stone, and kept well maintained. Each home had a garden in front of it, with plenty of iepurrans of all sizes and colouring tending to the various patches of vegetables. The buildings were grouped together in clusters, all of them wide but low. If I were to go into any of them, I expected I‚Äôd have to squat to properly fit. There were few windows, and all that I could see were shuttered tight.

An open-air market showed off a lot of produce and trade was happening. Nothing like money was changing hands. Or paws? Instead, I noticed a lot of the vendors jutting down various transactions on *paper*, using pieces of charcoal to write.

Earthen and clay jugs of various sizes were traded for brightly-coloured vegetables and fruit. In some places I saw sacks of grain being exchanged. The noise was louder than I‚Äôd expected, but in an adorable way.

And the whole place smelled of flowers. Those were everywhere. Sweet scents tickled my nose as I passed patch after patch of bright flowers. The whole town looked like something dragged out of a storybook and just dropped into the middle of my imagination. I couldn‚Äôt remember other rabbit-themed books or movies, which was odd.

‚ÄúOkay, so there aren‚Äôt any elves,‚Äù I said, more to myself.

‚ÄúElves exist. They do not exist on Oresstria,‚Äù Eternity said.

I almost believed it and stifled another Middle Earth reference.

More guards. More pointing. More getting stared at as I slowly made my way deeper into the town, following the wide, twisting road. I expected I would get somewhere at some point. My heart beat harder in my chest, even if I still wasn‚Äôt tired after hours of hiking through the hills. The destination would probably be the end of the road, some fucked up metaphor for passing through life as I did, never stopping to take in what was around me.

I fucking hate metaphors‚Ä¶

Still, I went on, admiring the sights and wishing I still had my mobile phone with me. Would‚Äôve loved to take some photos of that quaint little town and its rabbit-like iepurrans. Just‚Ä¶ for the folder. I turned away from that thought.

As I turned away from the market, and walked for a couple more minutes through what was a patch of empty farm land, I was hit by a different smell.

The first whiff of rot almost turned my stomach inside out. I hadn‚Äôt eaten or drank anything, but the stench still made me gag and dry heave. It came like a punch beneath the ribs, more vile than some of the worst stinks I‚Äôd ever experienced before. And I‚Äôd once installed a garbage sorting robot for the city‚Äôs recycling facility. Even the literal garbage dump of Bucharest hadn‚Äôt reeked as foul as what hit me then.

A whole section of the town was isolated from the rest, with guards posted around it. In the middle of it was an oddly-grown tree, black as tar, with branches heading off in awkward directions. The iepurrans had built a fence around it and posted guards with spears and swords. They all wore masks with pouches dangling beneath the nose.

Black fruit grew on the branches in various shapes. As I approached‚Äîand I was the only one getting near, all the iepurrans gave the place a wide berth‚Äîone of the fruits detached from its branch and splashed on the ground with a sickening squelch. The stench increased and I had to lift my shirt to cover my face. My eyes watered and my ears rang as a headache formed in the back of my head.

I hurried past. One of the guards had caught sight of me and pointed me along. Its hand shook, a sign I wasn‚Äôt the only one affected by the smell.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù I asked when the stench had died down and I could breathe again. ‚ÄúWhat stank?‚Äù

Eternity did not reply, thought the light still bobbed around my head, dimming and growing in intensity, like a heartbeat. Somehow, I felt an odd mix of worry and anger coming from it, though it was barely there. It came and went in a flash, and I wasn‚Äôt certain I hadn‚Äôt just imagined it.

‚ÄúYou can leave,‚Äù Eternity finally said as another guard showed the way. ‚ÄúNothing is expected or demanded of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not passing that place again,‚Äù I said, and meant it. I would‚Äôve done absolutely anything else rather than go past that stinking tree ever again.

‚ÄúAs you wish.‚Äù

The road took a last bend and I found myself in a wide open plaza, with a well in the centre. It was one of those really-old style wells, with a shadoof, while its wall was just a circle of rocks piled together to about hip-height. An iepurran waited next to it.

It wore a red toga‚Äîmost of the others were white linen, while the guards wore black‚Äîand in one hand it held a tall staff almost my height. I couldn‚Äôt really distinguish one iepurran from another, aside from the obvious colour of their fur, but this one had a wizened look and was shorter than most of the others. Its whiskers drooped.

‚ÄúIs this their leader?‚Äù I asked, tilting my head toward Eternity. A *‚ÄúTake me to your leader‚Äù* joke felt too childish at the moment.

The light blob drifted away from me and stopped a palm‚Äôs width from the iepurran‚Äôs nose. They spoke in that rapid language, the iepurran gesturing with its cane at the well.

As I approached, I noticed how wide the well‚Äôs opening actually was‚ÄîI could fit through it if I felt like taking a cool dip.

‚ÄúThe wise Eklil welcomes you to his humble town. Your arrival has been keenly anticipated,‚Äù Eternity said, returning to my shoulder.

‚ÄúWhat for?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúTo fix what is broken,‚Äù it replied. ‚ÄúIf you choose.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh. Any other details?‚Äù

‚ÄúI cannot say.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt they do it?‚Äù I asked, looking at the crowd that was gathering around me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt they know how to go into a well?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey cannot go where you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúMeaning?‚Äù

‚ÄúI cannot say.‚Äù

Well, that was wonderfully unhelpful. But this wasn‚Äôt my first time being told ‚Äúsomething is broken‚Äîplease fix it.‚Äù I‚Äôve driven all over Romania with only that to go on. Broken reducer? Altered code? A button *nobody ever* pressed? Nothing new under the sun, apparently. It could happen in a galaxy far, far away the same as in the next town over.

I sighed. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ lead on,‚Äù I said, barely suppressing a laugh.

This was Hell. Any notion of Heaven fled my mind. I‚Äôve spent my whole adult life dealing with vague instructions, crawling into narrow spaces, and tackling unreasonable demands. Now I got to do it again while waiting to die. And as Eternity floated toward the well, I confirmed the universe truly hated me.

Narrow, dark spaces‚Äîstory of my life. And this one would probably be wet, just for the extra crunch.

You can‚Äôt outrun the things you most want to avoid. Except I never ran; I just coped, being a coward who feared confrontation and stayed happily stuck in my own rut. I got to do it again! Yay!

I took a deep, calming breath and stepped up to the well.

‚ÄúMight as well get this over with,‚Äù I grumbled, inclining my head to the iepurran in what I hoped was a friendly gesture.

The iepurran halted me with a raised paw, then touched a pattern in the well‚Äôs stone base. It glowed under his fingers, and the well‚Äôs mouth flared bright‚Äîbright, as in \*fucking blinding!‚Äî\*yellow. Moments later‚Äîonce the spots cleared from my vision‚Äîa portal covered the well‚Äôs mouth.

How did I know it was a portal? Simple: until moments before, the well‚Äôs mouth had been dark and ominous, but now was turned into a swirling blue mass of‚Ä¶ something. It was still ominous, and staring too hard into it hurt my head. In a world of AI guides and sentient rabbits, a portal barely moved the needle of the weirdness scale.

‚ÄúFeet first is the recommended approach,‚Äù Eternity said. ‚ÄúOtherwise you might land on your head. I am aware that it hurts for your species.‚Äù

I imagined myself diving in like in a pool and stifled the laugh. Eternity had a sense of humour. *That* did move the weirdness needle.

‚ÄúAnd what exactly am I supposed to do once I‚Äôm through?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI cannot say,‚Äù Eternity said, not missing a single beat.

*Well, fuck you too.* And I hoped it heard that thought.

I swung one foot over the edge of the portal, and I managed to tumble through, never one to miss an opportunity for a painful spill.

I landed rough, on my side, with a grunt. I'd fallen on the fucking sword and felt the scabbard bruise my ribs. After some cursing, I got back to my feet and peered up at the hole I had fallen out of. Or into. Or through? I dunno, portals are weird.

A bunch of iepurrans were now gathered around the well, watching me, ears twitching, whiskers trembling, apparently talking to each other‚Äîthough I couldn‚Äôt hear a thing. Most interestingly, the Eternity light blob had remained behind.

‚ÄúEternity?‚Äù I called.

\[INTERFACE TO ETERNITY UNAVAILABLE WHILE WITHIN *DUNGEON*\]

\[FUNCTIONALITY RUNNING ON LOCAL INSTANCE\]

\[YOU RETAIN FULL ACCESS TO STATS AND SKILLS\]

‚ÄúDungeon? What the fuck?‚Äù

There was little to see around me‚Äîjust a dark room, lit only by the glow from the portal overhead. A moment later, something clattered at my feet: a torch and what looked like a matchbox. One of the iepurrans above gestured frantically, demonstrating how to strike the match against the box. I followed their instructions and lit the torch.

The flame cast a shimmering blue light, and it wasn‚Äôt as hot as expected. Okay, I had light now. That was an improvement.

Next, to find that which was broken, whatever that meant.

The room remained featureless even in the blue light. One wall had a door about twice my height, with a handle that suggested I might open it.

With no further instructions, I did the only thing available to me: I headed to the door and whatever awaited beyond. I was in Hell, so demons were a good bet, even if sentient bunnies were also an option.

Demon bunnies, maybe?

While the door was imposing in size, the handle turned easily and the whole thing swung open without so much as a whisper. From the grey, featureless room, I entered a larger one‚Äîalso featureless‚Äîwith an identical door on the far wall. The only light source remained my torch, though I could make out faint tendrils of color on the circular wall.

Rather than cut straight across, I followed the wall, holding the torch near the colours. Everything was tinted blue from the flame but the tendrils were distinct. If I were to guess, I would‚Äôve imagined that was water damage, as though moisture had seeped in and stained the stone. Strangely, it originated from the door, not from above, where one would expect a leak.

By some ancient instinct, I drew the sword--which needed a little dance of holding the scabbard between my knees so I wouldn't drop the torch. It took me a moment to realise that was an instinct I‚Äôd never had before. ‚ÄúDraw weapon‚Äù was not part of my normal life choices, but here something warned me of danger. Up until this moment, I‚Äôd almost forgotten I carried the thing.

Nothing jumped out at me but the oppressive silence was unsettling. Worse, the torch burned noiselessly, and my footsteps made no sound, as though I walked on thick carpet.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called, wondering if there was some anti-sound effect at play.

Nope!

The opposite happened: my voice rebounded a million times, echo shrieking and amplifying for what felt like an hour, before disappearing with a sudden pop.

Okay, no more talking until I finished whatever it was I had to do. I regretted not taking Eternity‚Äôs suggestion earlier to fuck off back into the hills. It would‚Äôve made a whole lot more sense than to drop through a portal into a well. Again, story of my life: unprepared and uninformed, charging ahead because changing direction is *hard.*

I felt a spiral of self-pity coming on, so I cut it short. I could just go back‚Äîthe door behind me was still open. I could signal them to pull me out.

For no other reason than absurd optimism, I expected they wouldn‚Äôt just leave me down here.

Would they?

*What if ‚ÄúLife must continue‚Äù actually meant ‚ÄúFeed the cosmic horror on the other side of the well, so it won‚Äôt starve‚Äù?*

There was no handle on the other door. In the torchlight, the discoloration around it glistened wetly and I had to resist the urge to touch it. A thick, gelatinous sludge oozed past the door‚Äôs frame.

Pressing on the door did nothing.

Pushing sideways with my shoulder didn‚Äôt budge it.

Kicking it didn‚Äôt even make a sound.

How was I supposed to open the stupid thing?

I wandered about for a time. No writing on the walls, no buttons‚Äîjust blank stone all around, featureless and blue. To be thorough, I headed to the centre of the space, checking for trapdoors or pressure plates.

As I moved from the open door to the locked one, right in the middle, my foot hit a hidden plate. Of course it was smack down in the centre‚Äîwhere else would it be?

The floor sunk about a centimetre under my weight and the door behind me slammed shut with a thunderous boom echoing through the newly sealed chamber. I clamped my hands over my ears, clenched my eyes shut, and waited for the thunder to die away. It went on for an unreasonably long time, rattling even my teeth in my gums.

When I opened my eyes after the echo had gone, I wished I were somewhere different.

In the split second it took me to realize how utterly fucked I was, I really, really regretted jumping down there without a second thought.

1ok2utd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ok2utd,Nekajui- review!,"It doesn‚Äôt look like anyone has reviewed this property in TCT so I thought I‚Äôd throw this out there! 

Just got back from 4 nights at the newish Ritz Carlton Reserve in Costa Rica and absolutely loved it so I thought I‚Äôd drop some notes about why.

Property: 
Absolutely a feat of design- they really thought of everything and the entire property feels very luxe. We were hesitant when booking because the pools didn‚Äôt seem that amazing but they truly were AND we loved that there were multiple vibes and temps. The spa pool is heated, the main pools are more shallow and also have an amazing hot tub on the adult level which juts out over a cliff. The room was phenomenal- very comfortable and well appointed. We had an ocean view king suite. The only note is that there is A LOT of walking on this property but we loved that. While we thought the hanging bridge was going to be a novelty, it actually was how we had to go to and fro our room haha. It‚Äôs amazing and really feels dramatic with the surroundings every time you walk around and the funicular is also super cool. They have gold carts and will take you everywhere but we opted to walk 95% of the time. We were in building 5 which maybe has some of the best views but word of warning that it also likely has the most stairs. 

Service:
Absolutely perfect- we‚Äôve stayed at Zadun and Dorado as well as many other tropical resorts with butler service and while Zadun really has gone above and beyond for us, we found every single person that we encountered here to be so lovely and generous. Everyone remembered us and we really felt also cared for in an unobtrusive way. 

Food:
Way more delicious than we thought. Honestly the menus all sounded a bit boring and we thought that we‚Äôd not have any noteworthy meals but we were totally wrong. Honestly Cafe Rincon was a highlight - absolutely mind blowing coffee, legendary pastries and truly gracious staff.  The pool food was better than we thought too- the tuna poke bowl and fish tacos were real stars and way more interesting and flavorful than the descriptions lead on.  We waited until the last night to eat at Niri which is a Spanish inspired restaurant down by the beach- so sad that it took us so long to go down there because it was BY FAR the best meal that we had. We had a grilled scallop dish that might be my favorite thing I‚Äôve eaten all year.  The setting was also absolutely magical- down near the beach but in complete darkness where you can hear the ocean but not see it- which is part of the magic of how undisturbed this part of Costa Rica is and how well the ritz did in minimizing their footprint (I mean relative to resorts we‚Äôve been to in other countries). 

Additional notes:
- the spa services are amazing but the facilities are absolutely unreal. My husband was obsessed with the extremely well equipped gym and I loved using the spa pool which was warm and was super fun to use when we had occasional rain showers. The view is amazing. 
- we had really hoped to see some amazing wildlife and this delivered on an epic scale. We saw two types of monkeys including a total monkey take over of the spa pool (like 20 white face monkeys at once haha). 
- INFLUENCERS- this is a note to anyone here who might be doing it for the ‚Äògram. Please be considerate of others. The influencing was nearly constant- one couple set up a tripod pointed at the pool every time they went somewhere and it would just constantly record for HOURS in some instances making it uncomfortable for us to want to swim since we don‚Äôt really want to end up as someone‚Äôs content haha. Just a note that nobody thinks it‚Äôs cute to stage a full photo shoot in a common area. 


Feel free to ask any questions! It‚Äôs our favorite resort that we‚Äôve ever been to.

1ok2upw,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1ok2upw/the_ramsey_deer/,The Ramsey Deer,"*I've had the idea for these creatures for a while, but I was never sure how to integrate them into a story. I feel like it may be missing something...Thoughts?*

*The story:*

  
	It must first be said that the deer in Ramsey Township are not of high moral standing. Residents of the township have learned the hard way that trash bins must be locked in at night and toys cannot be left out in the yard. The city has even had to fortify the telephone poles, lest a rutting stage get any ideas. The deer are, by all means, nuisances, but you aren‚Äôt allowed to hunt them. Instead, a select few are chosen to feed them intentionally.

	My neighbor, Mrs. Chapman, was one of the deer feeders. I used to think she was intimidating. There was no fence between her yard and ours, so after we‚Äôd moved in, my mother would chat with her while sipping her morning coffee. Mrs. Chapman spoke in a flat, humorless tone. Her eyes did not convey any particular feeling, unless my mother laughed, then a fleeting smile would cross her face. Her nails were short and chipped, her hands had thick calluses and thin, white scars. They talked about the weather, the mole hills in the lawn, the beautiful flowers around town. If you asked Mrs. Chapman, she could find a way for just about anything to be the deers‚Äô fault.

	‚ÄúThey took down the soccer goals at the park. Damn deer must be getting tangled in the nets again.‚Äù

	‚ÄúIt's rutting season. That‚Äôs why your tires are flat.‚Äù

	‚ÄúThe window at the butcher‚Äôs shop is broken. Those damn deer.‚Äù

	‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they get rid of them?‚Äù My mother once asked. ‚ÄúSurely they‚Äôre not worth the trouble?‚Äù

	‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt hurt Ramsey deer,‚Äù said Mrs. Chapman. That was the answer anyone gave when it came to the deer. Like a bad football team, people would openly hate the deer until confronted about them. Our neighbors would shake their fists at toppled recycling bins and downed power lines, but at town hall meetings, they‚Äôd espouse the environmental benefits of the deer and the ethics of hunting. No, you don‚Äôt hurt Ramsey deer. Those are *our* deer.¬†

	The first time I saw a Ramsey deer up close was in the fall of 2010. I‚Äôd crashed into my yard and flopped into a freshly raked pile of leaves, certain that nothing was more difficult than middle school pre-algebra. The sky was streaked with orange and pink. The days were getting shorter, and I hadn‚Äôt gotten used to the early arrival of night yet.

	The first signal was the sniffing. Something huffed and puffed nearby, a sound deeper than what I‚Äôd heard my dog do. Then came the pawing and stomping. The deer had seen me and were curious. Two does filed out of the woods politely, and I sat in awe of their red pelts. I‚Äôd never seen deer with coats like this before; faint black streaks stretched over their haunches just like the stripes on a tiger. A stag came out next, velvet fur still covering his magnificent antlers. It was early in the season yet; their antlers would eventually shed that fur and be smooth.

	The deer looked directly at me. Their eyes were remarkably feline: forward-facing and round. The male stalked closer, faint scars criss-crossed his snout. I backed away slowly as he drew nearer. His yellow eyes reflected the street lights and seemed to glow menacingly. His lips curled‚ÄîI hadn‚Äôt known they could do that‚Äîand revealed rows and rows of hooked teeth with deep orange enamel.

	‚ÄúAlice.‚Äù

	The deer dropped its predatory stance. The does pricked their ears towards someone behind me. I scooted all the way backwards until my back hit Mrs. Chapman‚Äôs legs.

	‚ÄúThe deer! They‚Äôre‚Äî‚Äú

	Mrs. Chapman tutted at me and pulled me up by my backpack. ‚ÄúStand tall, it‚Äôs alright.‚Äù

	I would‚Äôve begged to differ, but Mrs. Chapman had already dropped a large, slightly damp cube into my hands. It was larger than my entire fist, and it dripped red juice down my wrists. Large flakes of salt coated it like breading on chicken. ‚ÄúYou ever fed a horse before? Hold your hand out flat.‚Äù

	‚ÄúAre you crazy?‚Äù I squealed. The deer all bared their teeth at the sound. I tried to hide behind Mrs. Chapman, but she held me firmly in front of her.

	‚ÄúIf you give them food, they‚Äôll associate you with something good. Hold out your hand.‚Äù

	I watched one of the does prowl closer, sniffing the air curiously. I looked back at Mrs. Chapman, expecting her face to be inscrutable. Instead, she had the same smile she wore when joking with my mother. Subtle, but confident and kind.¬†

	The doe came closer. I shut my eyes and slowly extended my hand, expecting the scrape of teeth. A long, course tongue lapped at my fingers. Mrs. Chapman tutted at me for not holding my hand flat enough. I stiffened my elbow and held the cube up higher. Soon, all three creatures were lapping at my offering. I opened my eyes just in time for one of the does to delicately pluck the cube from my hand. She pranced away and shook her head, more deer-like than predatory. Mrs. Chapman tossed more cubes indelicately towards the other two, and the stag stupidly rammed his antlers into the dirt in his hurry to get one.

	I lowered my arm as Mrs. Chapman pointed to the ground. ‚ÄúLook.‚Äù

	The first doe had lain down, her yawn revealing many rows of teeth with a few missing canines. She lowered her head, and beneath her nose sprouted fresh, green grass. Beneath the other doe‚Äôs hooves, batches of verdant moss erupted from deadened grass. The stag, having finally retrieved his food, pulled his antlers out of the dirt, and in their place was a spray of delicate bean sprouts.

	Over time, I noticed more of what other people had to say about the deer. ‚ÄúI hate having them in my yard,‚Äù said the old man at the bakery. ‚ÄúBut my garden‚Äôs never looked greener.‚Äù One of my classmates, a puny little girl, wrote a paper about her hero, Mrs. Chapman, who wrestled a soccerball from a deer‚Äôs mouth and returned it to her with a bouquet coming out of its seams. My own mother told me never to go outside while the deer were out, yet she cooed at a striped and spotted doe from the porch one evening.

	Today, there is a very tentative peace between the deer and the people. More people have signed up to feed the deer, but the complaints against them grow harsher and harsher each year. New construction has had to be cancelled due to ruminant interference. People have moved away. Parks are empty long before sunset. But as I sit on the porch watching a snaggle-toothed fawn wobble through its parents' trail of sprouts and buds, I can‚Äôt help but extend a cut of meat, and hope for beautiful blooms to follow.",0,1761838280.0,writers,1,0.5,False

After getting married and juggling busy careers, we decided to go down the IVF route so we could freeze embryos for later, as his company covered it. When starting the process and doing genetic carrier testing last year, we learned that I was a carrier for an X-linked dominant condition that caused severe male intellectual and physical disability (I'm a female carrier, so 50% of having a son with the condition), and realised that we would have to use IVF to conceive in future anyway, so we can avoid passing on this gene.

In the last 6 months, I have been through 3 cycles of IVF, and it's been pretty hard physically and mentally, but I've tried to stay strong and be brave. It's made me reflect a lot on his behaviour:

* He has an intense job (as do I), so I do everything at home and cook for him, plan all of our holidays and social life, organise presents for his family and friends, and basically anything domestic. His job always comes first, and I'm very supportive of that. He says he doesn't ask for any of it and doesn't really appreciate it, but I want to make his life as easy as possible, and ultimately, someone has to do these things, and we can't eat takeaway every day.
* He has very little respect for cleaning up after himself, e.g. leaves underwear and socks on the floor constantly, doesn't clean up coffee stains on the counter, doesn't put his clothes away, and only does very small chores when specifically asked. 
* We have to spend every Christmas with his family (we live in the UK, he is German, I am from another country) and he is adamant this has to happen, and he has pushed back on this, despite me wanting to do other things like take a holiday during this time.
* His parents always let him do whatever he wanted and spoiled him a lot, so I don't think he knows how to manage stress, anger or emotions and can be quite grumpy and moody and negative, despite me nicely asking him to consider how that makes me feel and being upset/crying. 
* He is obsessed with the gym, and goes multiple hours a day, and gets angry when we travel and there isn't a ""good"" gym there. He sleeps very little and hardly ever takes rest days, despite me pleading with him to have more downtime and take care of his health. He also eats a lot of processed protein bars, shakes, etc., despite suggesting I can make him healthier options or to get a coach who can guide him through healthy habits. He doesn't want any advice and thinks he knows best.
* He can be really mean and cruel, e.g. told me he wouldn't celebrate me for Mother's Day if I was pregnant, as I technically wouldn't be a mother yet, and wouldn't budge and said we'd have to implant after Mother's Day if this was the case.
* He gets really angry and yells at me when I try and set normal boundaries, and says that I'm trying to change/control him. He often yells at me even when I start to cry.

The big thing is that in the last couple of years, this childhood friend reappeared in his life who is quite troubled and who I think has been a negative influence on his life. He's regularly flying home to go partying with him, staying out on Friday and Saturday until 8am at these raves, and despite me thinking it's really unhealthy I try and be supportive and I've never stopped him, despite me showing disapproval and saying I don't feel super comfortable with it, especially as they are in their late 30's and usually there are really young people at parties. I don't know if he's doing drugs or why he's so obsessed with it, and I've tried to be open when they have organised boys trips to Vegas, etc. but I am really uncomfortable with it as I think this friend isn't a great influence.

I don't love the friend as he has had trouble (crashed his car and escaped the US because he wasn't insured), but mostly because at 37 years old, he sleeps with really young girls and I think he's a bit of a predator and creep. He doesn't have a serious job, savings, and is one of those typical guys who never want to grow up. 

Everything blew up a couple of weeks ago because he said he was getting a tattoo with said friend of some swords, reference to the three musketeers, and that he'd always wanted one and ""I said yes"". Over a month ago, on a walk in the park, he hypothetically told me he wanted a tattoo with this friend of a small triangle, and I sort of dismissed it as he didn't really mention a set design or a time, and I didn't really think it was going to be in the near future. A week after my 3rd retrieval, he mentions that it's booked in and that they decided on swords. I got really upset as I was still recovering from the surgery and thought it was terrible timing, and a grown man in his late 30's doesn't rush into getting a tattoo and decide on the design spontaneously without thought.

I have never stopped him from partying, but he has been horrible to me for putting my foot down due to the spontaneous tattoo, and he humiliated me in front of my friend over the weekend when I reminded him we had ballet tickets a few days later (which he agreed to and has been in his calendar for months). My friend spoke to me after and said he was concerned about how he was treating me and that it's not ok to snap at me like this. I've always put it down to him being grumpy and German, but I'm starting to think that he's actually a bit abusive and spoilt.

Maybe this whole fertility journey is affecting him more than I realised, but I'm so resentful that I'm the one having to go through the whole process, injections, hormones, skin rashes and reactions, etc. and he's acting like a teenager, and it's really making me question everything. I have a session booked with the clinic counsellor on Monday, but would appreciate any advice from this community. I know he's not ready to have a child right now or potentially ever, and I know that things will continue to get worse unless he really reflects and changes.

**Part 1: The Vaccine**

The world wasn‚Äôt what it used to be. It was a shell: empty, brittle, and scarred by something that couldn‚Äôt be seen anymore but still lingered everywhere. The virus had torn through everything; cities, families, nations, leaving behind silence where there used to be commotion and clatter. Streets once alive with chatter were now hollow canyons of concrete and fading memory. It wasn‚Äôt that there was no longer anyone around. In fact, it was the people who made it worse. They moved like ghosts, all of them with faces hidden, eyes down, every gesture cautious. Everyone spoke in muffled tones, careful not to breathe too close, nor to touch too long. The sickness was gone, sure, but the fear, that had stayed. It seeped into the air like smoke from a fire that never really went out.

Mark had recently turned thirty, though lately he had felt a lot older. Just another man in another apartment, doing the same things on the same screens, day after day. Once, not so long ago, he‚Äôd had a life: a commute, coffee breaks, laughter in bars, the buzz of being around people. Now it was just muted voices over video calls and the hollow sound of his own footsteps echoing through empty streets. His world had shrunk to four walls and a dim laptop glow.

When the vaccine had come, it hit the world like a thunderclap. Salvation in a syringe, they promised. The media called it a modern-day miracle, a victory for humankind. The news channels ran stories of doctors smiling, families hugging, the word ‚Äúhope‚Äù flashing across screens like a brand logo. But Mark didn‚Äôt buy it‚Ä¶ at least not completely. It was all too fast, too polished. Science didn‚Äôt work miracles overnight, not without a price. People called the doubters crazy, conspiracists, paranoid. But deep down, Mark knew there was something off, something rotten humming just beneath all the headlines and hashtags.

Still, the pressure to get the jab built. Everyone was doing it: posting selfies with their little vaccine cards, their captions all the same: *We did it. We‚Äôre safe now.* His parents called him every night, voices cracked with worry, telling him just to be responsible and do what needed to be done. Even Lily, his best friend since forever, sent him a message that felt more like an order than advice: *Come on, Mark. Just get it done.*

So, he caved. He booked the appointment. Told himself it was logic, not fear, that made him do it. But that night, as he sat in the dark, the flicker of the TV painted shadows across his face. The anchorwoman smiled a little too widely, her words a little too clean as she rattled off success rates and safety claims. Behind that plastic grin, though, Mark saw something else, something forced. Like everyone had decided to keep pretending things were fine until they finally believed it.

But Mark didn‚Äôt believe it. He knew that he never really had. The world had already cracked, the veneer had gone, and no shot could fix that. Lying awake, the city dead quiet outside, he felt it: that gnawing truth in his gut. This virus was not like the one that had come before, that one that had been a test run for how humanity would react to lockdowns and enforced vaccinations. No, this one really had changed everything, and maybe the cure would change it even more. Maybe this wasn‚Äôt the end of the nightmare. Maybe it was just the start.

¬†

**Part 2: Lily**

Mark got the shot on a dead gray Tuesday afternoon, the kind of day that felt like it had been drained of all color. The clinic was packed tight with bodies, yet no one made a sound. Just rows of masked faces staring ahead, eyes empty, like cattle waiting for slaughter. The air smelled of antiseptic and it felt like you could cut the fear with a knife. A nurse, plastic visor, latex gloves, her voice stripped of even the slightest hint of warmth, called his name. He followed her into a narrow room that felt even colder than the hallway.

The shot itself was nothing. A prick, a flash of sting, and it was done. ‚ÄúYou might feel tired,‚Äù the nurse said, her voice flat, already looking past him to the next in line. ‚ÄúMaybe a little headache. Drink water.‚Äù It was odd: her words sounded rehearsed, like she‚Äôd said them a thousand times and stopped meaning them after the first hundred. To be fair, though, she had probably said them thousands of times, so it was understandable for her to be going through the motions. Mark nodded, rolled down his sleeve, and walked out with a small square of gauze taped to his arm and an ache deep in his gut that had nothing to do with the needle.

That night, the fever well and truly hit: a low, humming heat that crawled up his arm and settled behind his eyes. He lay in bed, sweating, drifting in and out of half-dreams where faces melted and reformed, always watching him. By morning, the fever had broken, but the world didn‚Äôt feel right. The city looked the same, but it wasn‚Äôt. People‚Äôs faces seemed‚Ä¶ unstable. Not enough to notice if you weren‚Äôt looking, but enough to make his skin crawl. Little things, easy to not notice, or ignore even if you did. Eyes that didn‚Äôt quite match the mouth beneath them. Jawlines that seemed to flicker, like reflections on disturbed water.

Within a week, everything had changed again. The streets filled back up, the noise returned, and the news couldn‚Äôt stop calling the vaccine a miracle. Infection rates nosedived, smiles spread, real or otherwise, and people started seeing each other in person again. Hope was well and truly back on the menu. But the fringes of the internet whispered a significantly different story for those who cared to look. Short posts. Deleted videos. Seemingly outrageous claims that people were ‚Äúglitching‚Äù mid-conversation: faces rippling, skin reforming into someone else‚Äôs. The experts we were presented with merely referred to it as trauma, mass hysteria, brain fatigue. Everyone nodded along because, well‚Ä¶ that explanation was easier to swallow.

Mark didn‚Äôt believe any of it‚Ä¶ until Lily.

They met one late afternoon, a pot of coffee steaming between them, the blinds slicing the sunlight into stripes across her living room. For the first time in months, he almost felt human again. Lily was talking about work, about some poor bastard who‚Äôd fainted in a meeting. She laughed, then abruptly stopped. Her eyes locked on his, her face frozen mid-expression.

Then her skin began to crawl.

Not in a metaphorical way‚Ä¶ literally. Her features shifted, her bones seemingly rearranging in tiny, horrifying spasms. Her eyes turned into his eyes. Her lips pressed into his exact shape. His expression, the tight, thoughtful frown he made without realizing, now appeared on her face like a reflection in wet glass.

And when she spoke, it was his voice, or at least a very close approximation of it, that came out.

‚ÄúMark,‚Äù she said, or maybe *he* did‚Ä¶ ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù

His hand trembled. Coffee sloshed against the rim of the cup. The air between them buzzed, like static before lightning. Then, just like that, it was gone. Her face snapped back. Her eyes softened. She blinked, smiled, and kept talking. As if nothing had happened.

Mark forced a nod, but his heart was pounding hard enough to hurt. He pretended to listen, pretended to laugh, but his mind was spiraling.

That night, he didn‚Äôt sleep. He just lay there, watching the shadows crawl across his ceiling, replaying the moment again and again. By sunrise, he was telling himself it was probably just fatigue. A trick of the light. The brain playing games after months of isolation.

But it kept happening. Everywhere. Subtle, quiet, but increasingly constant. A coworker‚Äôs eyes flashing green for a second before returning to brown. A stranger on the subway smiling in sync with another‚Äôs grin like a reflection caught in motion. The patterns multiplied. Faces blurred, overlapped, melted into one another until he couldn‚Äôt tell where one person ended and another began.

And through it all, Mark stayed the same. His reflection never rippled. His features never changed. Whatever the vaccine had done to everyone else, it had skipped him.

He was the last original face in a world full of copies.

**Part 3: The Mimic Phenomenon**

Within a month, the world came apart at the seams. It didn‚Äôt happen all at once: it crept in, like mold spreading under paint, slow and silent until you realized everything was already rotting. What began as small glitches, faces flickering at the edge of your vision, reflections that didn‚Äôt quite line up, turned into something monstrous. Now, people‚Äôs faces didn‚Äôt stay still. They pulsed, morphed, flowed like wet clay trying to remember a shape. Eyes shifted color, mouths warped mid-sentence, and every street looked like a fever dream of half-familiar strangers.

The media tried to make sense of it. They called it *The Mimic Phenomenon.* Experts paraded across TV screens, although their expressions were a little too composed, their words too smooth to trust. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs temporary,‚Äù one said. ‚ÄúA benign neurological response. A kind of visual empathy.‚Äù The phrase spread like disinfectant: clean, sterile, and just plain wrong. Nobody believed it. On the streets, people stopped looking at one another. Conversations died. Windows were covered, mirrors smashed, gatherings outlawed. Cities went quiet again‚Ä¶ only this time, even the silence felt infected.

The government‚Äôs response was one of ¬†panic. Curfews. Mandates. Emergency broadcasts. Masks came back, thicker than before. Posters screamed from every corner: **PROTECT YOUR IDENTITY. STAY SAFE. STAY YOURSELF.** Eye contact was labeled a public health hazard. Even reflections were censored: mirrors were wrapped in black plastic like corpses. It wasn‚Äôt about protecting people anymore. It was about containing the panic.

For Mark, the world had turned into a nightmare with no waking up. He watched people he loved disintegrate behind their faces. His parents, once so different, started to blend into one another until they shared the same mouth, the same dull eyes. They moved in sync, speaking in unison without realizing it. His office turned into a factory of copies: rows of identical grins and mirrored gestures, voices merging into a single drone. And Lily‚Ä¶ she was disappearing piece by piece. Each time he saw her, she looked less like herself. Sometimes she had *his* eyes. Sometimes her voice cracked into *his* tone. Once, she caught her reflection in a window and laughed with a sound that wasn‚Äôt her own.

Mark tried to fight it. He filmed people morphing in public, even recorded Lily mid-shift, but the footage never came out right. Faces smeared, data corrupted, static tearing through every frame. Online, he tried to post about it everywhere he could, to warn others, but the messages always vanished within minutes. Auto-deletions, apparently. ‚ÄúSpreading misinformation,‚Äù the replies said. The internet had turned into another control tool. The truth wasn‚Äôt just being hidden: it was being erased.

So, he went underground. Nights blurred into each other as he dug ever deeper, ¬†tearing through data leaks, encrypted files, government archives, anything that might explain what was happening. What he found froze him to the core. A classified document buried deep in a medical archive: **VIRAL ADAPTATION HYPOTHESIS: HUMAN SUBJECT TRIALS, PHASE 4.** It described something prehistoric: a survival reflex buried in human DNA. Early humans had survived by becoming one another, by mimicking the pack to confuse predators. The vaccine, meant to boost immunity through genetic rewriting, had accidentally flipped that switch back on.

It wasn‚Äôt evolution. It was regression.

Humanity was dissolving into itself.

Mark sat in the dark, the screen‚Äôs blue light flickering over his face. Outside his window, the city moved like a single, breathing organism. He could see them walking under the lamps: figures with faces that bled into one another, melding and separating like smoke. No individuality. No difference. Just a gray tide of flesh and movement.

He touched the window, the chill biting into his hand. For a long time, he just stood there, watching. That‚Äôs when it hit him.

He wasn‚Äôt immune. He was incompatible.

Whatever the vaccine had done to everyone else, it hadn‚Äôt worked on him. He was the flaw in the pattern, the anomaly that couldn‚Äôt blend.

And in a world that worshiped sameness‚Ä¶ that made him dangerous.

¬†

**Part 4: Identity differentiation**

It was well past midnight when Mark finally found it: the truth he‚Äôd been clawing toward for weeks. By this point his apartment was a wreck of stale air and cold caffeine, coffee cups crowding the desk beside a laptop that hummed like a dying engine. Outside, the city murmured: a low, restless noise that never really slept.

Lines of code scrolled across the cracked screen, reflected in Mark‚Äôs tired eyes. He‚Äôd broken through a wall of encryption‚Äîgovernment firewalls, proxy servers, and dead-end IPs‚Äîuntil he reached the digital underbelly of the Department of Global Health. A vault of sealed files, never meant to see daylight.

The documents were corrupted, redacted beyond reason, but one phrase kept surfacing like a ghost from the code: **‚ÄúGenetic Cohesion Initiative.‚Äù**

At first, he‚Äôd thought it was just another bureaucratic buzzword, something about herd immunity or vaccine outreach. But the deeper he dug, the colder it got. But this wasn‚Äôt a medical project: it was a controlled experiment‚Ä¶ on humanity itself.

Buried under miles of data, medical reports, and genetic schematics, the truth took shape. The mutation wasn‚Äôt an accident; it had been predicted. Planned, even. The so-called vaccine hadn‚Äôt been built to stop a virus. It had been designed to reshape people. To ‚Äústabilize social structures through biological alignment.‚Äù

They‚Äôd found a gene tied to individuality, identity differentiation, they called it and flipped it. Their logic was equal parts elegant and monstrous: if people were too different, they fought; if they were the same, they‚Äôd obey. By rewriting one strand of DNA, they could dissolve conflict, emotion, and ego; force the species into perfect, docile harmony.

One report stopped his breath cold.

‚ÄúTransformation is likely to become permanent within 3 to 6 weeks of exposure. Subjects exhibit mimicry behavior, loss of self-identity, and eventual cognitive synchronization with surrounding individuals. In high-density areas, full homogenization is expected.‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs chair creaked as he leaned back, staring at the words until they blurred. *Permanent.* *Loss of self.* *Synchronization.* They‚Äôd known. The politicians, the anchors, the doctors‚Ä¶ they‚Äôd all smiled for the cameras while the world quietly rewrote itself from the inside out.

He opened another file, one marked **CLASSIFIED: LEVEL 6 CLEARANCE.** The memo was brief, sterile, signed by someone high enough to stay untouchable.

‚ÄúThe side effects are acceptable. The survival of humanity requires unity over individuality. A world without identity is a world without conflict.‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs stomach twisted. They hadn‚Äôt cured anything. They‚Äôd committed the cleanest genocide in history‚Äîone gene at a time.

A sound snapped through the silence.

*Knock. Knock.*

He froze. Nobody was supposed to be out. The building had been on lockdown for weeks. The knock came again, softer but insistent.

He edged toward the door, heart hammering. Through the peephole, he saw her: Lily. She looked pale under the flickering hallway light, her mask pulled tight, her eyes glassy but aware.

‚ÄúMark?‚Äù she called, voice small, trembling. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre in there. Please‚Ä¶ we need to talk.‚Äù

He hesitated at first and then unlocked the door. She slipped inside like a shadow. Immediately he could tell that her movements were off: everything was too smooth, too deliberate, almost as if she was being remote-controlled.

When she pulled off her mask, Mark‚Äôs breath caught. Her face‚Ä¶ was changing. Not like an illusion, real flesh bending and twitching, her jawline rippling through shapes that weren‚Äôt hers. For a moment, it was his.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm losing myself,‚Äù she whispered. Her voice cracked and warped, sometimes hers, sometimes more like his. ‚ÄúI look at people, and I can‚Äôt tell who I am anymore.‚Äù

He wanted to hold her, to tell her it would be all right. But it wouldn‚Äôt. He knew now; this wasn‚Äôt a sickness. It was the new design.

Tears rolled down her flickering face. Then she smiled. Not her smile‚Ä¶ his.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Mark,‚Äù she said in his voice. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll all be one soon. That‚Äôs what they wanted.‚Äù

Something inside him broke at this. He stumbled backward, shaking, and the world seemed to tilt.

By dawn, he was gone. He packed what little he had and slipped into the streets, where the air itself felt heavy, synchronized, humming with static life.

The city loomed around him like a reflection of itself; faces blurring in the windows, voices blending into one endless echo. And everywhere he looked, the message burned bright across every billboard, every holo-screen, every government feed:

**‚ÄúTogether, we are stronger. Together, we are one.‚Äù**

For the first time, Mark understood.

They hadn‚Äôt united the world.

They‚Äôd erased it.

¬†

**Part 5: The Global Health Directorate**

Mark had followed the trail as far as it would go. Through derelict data vaults, quarantined research wings, and half-rotted files buried under bureaucratic lies, he followed the trail like a ghost tracking the scent of its own death. Every lead drew him deeper into the rot until it ended where it all began: the Global Health Directorate. The building loomed above the dead city like a monument to humanity‚Äôs arrogance: black glass, steel veins, and the faint hum of power still pulsing through its hollow heart.

The streets leading to it were a virtual graveyard. A cold rain fell, slicking the pavement, dripping off the still forms that lined the sidewalks. The mimics stood in perfect silence, heads tilted toward the sky, rainwater pooling in their open palms. Their eyes were empty, their skin wax-pale, their clothes soaked through but untouched by decay. They didn‚Äôt move. They didn‚Äôt breathe. They were waiting ‚Äî like statues waiting for orders from a god that no longer existed.

Inside, the air was cleaner than it had any right to be. The lights burned steady, the elevators still hummed, and the walls gleamed like they were polished yesterday. The building wasn‚Äôt abandoned. It was preserved, maintained by something that no longer needed hands. The digital billboards lining the corridors pulsed with white letters that bled into his vision:

**TOGETHER, WE ARE ONE.**

The phrase echoed down every corridor, mechanical and soft, like a prayer recited by the dead.

At the end of a long marble hallway, he found them, the architects of extinction. Three figures waited in a glass boardroom surrounded by walls of screens. Each display showed shifting faces, human features dissolving into one another until all that remained was a blurred, composite mask. The three stood perfectly still, their features unnaturally symmetrical. They didn‚Äôt look alive. They looked *designed.*

‚ÄúMr. Sinnott,‚Äù said the woman in the center, her voice calm and surgical. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been expecting you.‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs fists clenched at his sides. ‚ÄúYou knew. You *knew* what the vaccine would do.‚Äù

She smiled, or at least something close to a smile. ‚ÄúOf course we did. It was necessary. Humanity has been tearing itself apart for centuries. We removed the disease.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean people,‚Äù he said through his teeth. ‚ÄúYou erased them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said the man to her left, voice low, precise, almost gentle. ‚ÄúWe liberated them. The human condition was flawed‚Ä¶ violent, selfish, fractured. Now, there‚Äôs no more conflict. No more division. One mind. One body. Harmony.‚Äù

Mark shook his head, backing away. ‚ÄúYou turned them into reflections. Empty, thoughtless copies.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmpty?‚Äù The woman stepped closer, her form flickering as if reality couldn‚Äôt decide what shape she should wear. For a second, she looked just like him. Then she wasn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúThey are *complete*, Mark. There is peace now‚Ä¶ real peace. You could join them. It isn‚Äôt too late.‚Äù

For a heartbeat, he almost believed her. There was something intoxicating in the stillness of their voices: a promise of silence, of rest. The endless screaming of the old world had stopped. Maybe this was what humanity had always wanted: quiet. Unity.

But then he saw Lily in his mind‚Ä¶ her face collapsing, her eyes begging him to remember her before she disappeared into the swarm.

He steadied himself. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù he said, his voice hoarse. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt cure us. You killed everything that made us *human*.‚Äù

The lights shifted red. Alarms blared. The figures‚Äô faces twisted, their perfect symmetry was collapsing into chaos. Their skin rippled like liquid, their bodies merging, reforming. Then the three had become one, a mass of flesh and light and flickering human echoes, its voice now a chorus of thousands.

**‚ÄúJOIN US, MARK. YOU WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE ALONE.‚Äù**

And with that, he ran.

Down endless halls of mirrored glass where faceless reflections stared at him. The building shook under the sound of pursuit, hundreds if not thousands of synchronized footsteps pounding like war drums. He burst into what appeared to be some kind of control room. The cacophony of noise caused by his presence told him that this place was of vital importance to this whole situation. Could this be the central hub, the pulse of the network connecting every mimic on Earth, controlling their thoughts?

He didn‚Äôt get the chance to confirm his theory, as the creature behind him twitched. Fractured light crawled across its surface as the voices began to rethread themselves. It wasn‚Äôt gone. Not yet, at least.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt stop evolution,‚Äù it whispered, a thousand voices murmuring in one breath. ‚ÄúYou can only slow it down‚Ä¶ but you will ultimately fail.‚Äù

Mark turned and fled the building. Could the last man with his own face could still save what was left of mankind?

¬†

**Part 6: Harmony achieved**

Mark didn‚Äôt know how long he‚Äôd been running‚Ä¶ hours, days, maybe more. Time had stopped meaning anything. The world above had gone still, eerily still, like someone had hit pause on reality. Cities that once screamed with life now sat hushed, filled with people who moved like ghosts, smiling, synchronized, and soulless.

Everywhere, the same voice echoed, flat and artificial, pumped through the skeleton of civilization:

**‚ÄúHarmony achieved. Conflict resolved. Remain connected.‚Äù**

He lived on instinct now, scavenging from abandoned stores, drinking rainwater off rusted gutters, sleeping wherever the shadows stayed deepest. The trick was to avoid the crowds. Once you looked too long into their eyes, it was over.

Now and then, through the static of an old military radio he‚Äôd acquired, he‚Äôd catch fragments of something human:

‚ÄúIf you can hear this‚Ä¶ come south. We‚Äôre still ourselves. Follow these coordinates‚Äù

That whisper of hope pulled him through wastelands of glass and dust until he found them: the survivors.

They lived beneath the husk of an old power station, buried deep in concrete and shrouded in darkness. Maybe forty of them, tops. All were hollow-eyed, trembling, clinging to what was left of their humanity.

Among them was Dr. Ren, a small woman with dark circles under her eyes and a mind sharp enough to cut glass. Turned out she‚Äôd worked on the original vaccine before realizing what it truly was. When she saw what the Directorate had done, she herself had fled.

Ren told them about one last chance: not a cure, but a counterstrike. There was a frequency that could break the signal binding everyone together: a sonic disruption that might scramble the neural code controlling the mimicry. If they could piggyback it onto the global satellite grid, it might jolt some minds free‚Ä¶ or at least stop the infection from spreading further.

‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a coin toss,‚Äù she warned, voice steady but eyes full of dread. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôll do to those already changed.‚Äù

Mark looked around at the others; faces still unique, still alive, still theirs. ‚ÄúListen, I was there, at the central hub. There‚Äôs no way I could make it back without succumbing to the effects of the vaccine. If we don‚Äôt try this,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthen it‚Äôs already over.‚Äù

They worked like ghosts for days. Nobody spoke much. Cables were spliced, transmitters rewired, power rerouted from the city‚Äôs dying veins. The air down there was hot, thick with sweat. And at night, they‚Äôd hear them, the mimics, roaming above the tunnels in perfect rhythm, hundreds of feet dragging in unison.

When it was ready, they gathered in the control room. The satellite dish above the ruins was aligned, its gears creaking like old bones. Ren‚Äôs fingers shook as she entered the last sequence.

‚ÄúOnce this starts,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthey‚Äôll come for us.‚Äù

Mark chambered a round into the rifle he‚Äôd been supplied with. ‚ÄúThen we make it quick.‚Äù

The countdown began. The screens flared to life, static crawling like lightning across their surfaces. The pulse of the signal built in the wires, a low-frequency growl that made the walls vibrate.

Then came the sound from above.

Footsteps. Thousands of them.

The first impact made the ceiling dust rain down. Then the next. Then a roar of pounding, scraping, breaking. The swarm had found them.

The reinforced doors buckled under the pressure. Pale faces pressed against the glass, identical and empty, eyes wide and glowing with calm devotion.

‚ÄúJoin us,‚Äù they whispered, a perfect choir.

Gunfire tore through the air. The survivors held the line as best they could, brass casings clattering on the concrete floor. People screamed, then vanished into the mass. Mark saw bodies pulled apart, swallowed by the human tide.

Ren shouted over the noise, ‚ÄúThe signal‚Äôs live!‚Äù

Then the door gave way. She was dragged into the flood of bodies, her scream dissolving into the echo of their chant. Mark threw himself at the console, and slammed the override.

The world exploded in white.

The frequency wasn‚Äôt sound anymore, it was inside him. A vibration that ripped through his bones, his blood, his mind. It felt like being erased one atom at a time.

Then‚Ä¶ silence.

When Mark opened his eyes, everything was still. The mimics stood frozen mid-step, faces blank but solid, no longer shifting, no longer changing.

He stumbled through the wreckage. The survivors lay scattered, eyes open, yet unseeing. Even Ren was the same, caught mid-motion, her hand reaching for the console, expression locked in eternal terror.

He called out to her. Nothing. He called again. The echoes came back hollow, fading into the tunnels.

That‚Äôs when it hit him.

The signal had worked. but not the way they‚Äôd hoped. The transformation was over, but so was everything else. The infection was gone, yes, but so were their minds. Humanity hadn‚Äôt been saved. It had been paused.

He sank to his knees, light from the dying monitors painting his shadow across the wall. Above him, the world would be the same, frozen people standing in the streets, locked in the last thought they‚Äôd ever had.

Mark was alone again. But this time, the quiet wasn‚Äôt mercy.

¬†

**Part 7: The new world**

The world above was dead quiet.

When Mark climbed out of the tunnel, he expected panic: sirens, screaming, the echo of some last stand. Instead, there was nothing. Just still air and the heavy silence of a world that had stopped breathing. The streets stretched out in perfect order, cars parked in straight, obedient lines, doors hanging open like gaping mouths. Engines had long gone cold.

And the people, if you could still call them that, filled the sidewalks. Dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands. Frozen mid-step, mid-scream, mid-thought. Their faces locked between terror and peace, as if caught halfway through surrender.

The signal had done its job.

Mark moved carefully among them, afraid to touch. Their eyes were open but empty, glossy mirrors reflecting the pale red sun bleeding out behind the clouds. Each one unique, yet eerily the same, as though individuality had been sculpted into a single, perfect lie. The city had become a museum of humanity at the moment of its extinction.

‚ÄúTogether,‚Äù he muttered, voice cracking in the cold air. ‚ÄúExactly what they wanted.‚Äù

He wandered for hours. Or maybe days: time meant nothing now. His footsteps echoed off concrete and glass, the only sound left. Stores were stocked, homes untouched, offices frozen in mid-routine, the coffee cups were still steaming faintly in his imagination. Radios hissed with static. Screens stared back blank and blind. Even the sky seemed muted, the birds gone, the wind refusing to move.

It was a dead world pretending to still exist.

Mark stopped outside a shattered storefront. Behind the cracked glass, a dusty mirror leaned crookedly against the wall. He saw himself reflected in it: gaunt, hollow-eyed, but still breathing. The only thing that still moved.

He stepped closer, drawn to the one thing that proved he was still real. ‚ÄúAt least I‚Äôm still me,‚Äù he whispered.

But then his reflection blinked.

Not with him‚Ä¶ after him.

He froze. His heartbeat kicked hard against his ribs. The reflection‚Äôs lips began to twitch upward into a grin, slow and deliberate, until it was smiling at him. Not a kind smile; something colder, knowing, wrong. The eyes weren‚Äôt his anymore. They looked like someone else‚Äôs, like something else had taken root behind them.

Mark stumbled back, but the reflection stayed where it was, watching him. Its features rippled, as if testing shapes, trying on new faces beneath his skin.

Then, faintly, impossibly‚Ä¶ a whisper slid out from the glass, a sound more like breath than speech.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù it said in a voice almost identical to his own. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll join us soon.‚Äù

Mark turned and ran.

And as he did, the silence broke. Not with sound, but with movement.

The statues, all those still, frozen bodies, had turned. Every face in the city, every empty stare, was now pointed at him.",2,1761838144.0,ChillingApp,0,1.0,False

It was quite helpful in terms of my energy levels and focus for a while but I feel as though something is .. off now?

I wake up, take my Vyvanse at around 6/6:30am and by 10am I am so fatigued I have to nap. I‚Äôve been troubleshooting all of it - eating before meds, eating after meds, waiting 45 mins after meds to have any caffeine, protein shake with meds - and nothing seems to make a difference. At best I can push through until 2/3pm and nap then but my brain and my eyes still get SO TIRED so early in the day. The same thing happens when I take 40 or 50mg.

This happened for long enough in the spring that I went to the doctor - I had a full bloodwork panel and hormone testing and everything came back totally normally. Eventually, it went away but has started to happen again. Today I took my (now name brand because I thought that could make a difference) Vyvanse 40mg at 5:45am and drank a bunch of water. Did a 6am hot yoga class and came home had coffee and a high protein breakfast. And then come 9:50ish I had to lay down and slept for 30 mins. 

My sleep is good - and I know this because I track it with my Oura ring. I know it‚Äôs not an exact way to track but I trust that based on the metrics it obtains that it at least knows how long I‚Äôm sleeping at night - typically between 7.5-8.5 hours. 

I‚Äôm very active - I strength train twice a week, walk, and do hot yoga and Pilates. 

When my Vyvanse was working it was VERY apparent. My concentration and energy levels were excellent - a 40mg would last me all day. And I FELT GOOD!!!

I‚Äôm at a total loss. I feel like I‚Äôm doing everything right but this medication is just failing me. Any one else with a similar experience?

ETA - the only other med I take is fluoxetine (40mg). I also take fish oil, vitamin D, vitamin b12, l-theanine. And the. Magnesium at night. I also switched to take my Prozac at night as I thought maybe that was impacting my vyvanse. ",2,1761838128.0,VyvanseADHD,3,1.0,False

As of yesterday I was told San Francisco is no longer possible but was offered Chicago, Seattle or Austin. 

I've never been to these cities but also never had been to London before moving here and I'm willing to take a risk. Which city would match up with my life style best? I feel its best to tell you what I know and like about each place as information.

  
**About Me**  
M29, single, working in Tech Marketing. From ireland. I enjoy going to the gym, swimming, dogs, live music (indie/alternative or anything else), nights out and love good thai and mexican food. At weekends I usually go to random hobby meet ups, D&D or to the pub with friends. I tend to walk and cycle as much as possible for my commute. Salary would adjust for cost of living and will get some relocation support while I hunt for apartments 

**Why San Francisco**  
I felt i came alive in this city 

* Great weather
* Incredible food scene 
* The view and the mountains / hiking / outdoor fun 
* Friendly people (compared to London for sure) 
* Pretty walkable and the bart was handy 
* Farmers markets and incredible food scene 
* Always make friends on nights out 
* Yes its expensive and there was a homeless problem but never had any safety issues the 6 times I've been there

**Why leave London?**

* Not sure why I ever moved here
* winters are hard for low sunshine 
* Rain sure but no different to Ireland 
* people are COLD - it's been exhausting dating or trying to make friends over the last year 
* Feel like you get short changed on so many things - dodgy rent, low quality of service / food for what you pay etc 
* London just feels so rushed trying to organise time with people
* I do however like the coffee shops, variety of food, bike paths and parks 

  
**Chicago?**

* Maybe my top choice? 
* Understand you can live without a car thanks to the metro and walkabillity 
* overall seems cheaper than London from my research
* mixed reviews on friendliness - some say very friendly, others say too direct, others say mid-western niceness but rude behind your back 
* The lake access and summers for restaurants are good
* fun city for nightlife
* Very high crime rate? 
* Limited access to nature
* Brutal winters but some say maybe just 3-6 days of wind chill a year 

  
**Seattle?** 

* Best time zone regarding my job 
* Good opportunities for other jobs in tech 
* No state income tax but higher sales tax 
* mixed reviews on cycling 
* poor public transport to Bellevue, would probably need a car
* Some say its cheap some say rent is crazy high 
* Amazing access to nature
* I've heard about the seattle freeze and people can be flakey 
* Rains more than London but more drizzle, slightly more grey days but generally mild 
* Good food scene
* Maybe hard to meet people? 

  
**Austin?**

* Don't know much 
* Guaranteed to need a car? 
* Not sure about living in the Bible belt but here it's pretty progressive
* Obviously the best weather sunshine wise
* Up and coming tech scene 

  
Would love to hear people's takes on where might be the closest fit based on what I like about SF and hate about London. Especially if there are any Europeans, Irish or ex-londoners who made the leap to one of these cities

Thanks for listening to my TedTalk

**Part 1: The Vaccine**

The world wasn‚Äôt what it used to be. It was a shell: empty, brittle, and scarred by something that couldn‚Äôt be seen anymore but still lingered everywhere. The virus had torn through everything; cities, families, nations, leaving behind silence where there used to be commotion and clatter. Streets once alive with chatter were now hollow canyons of concrete and fading memory. It wasn‚Äôt that there was no longer anyone around. In fact, it was the people who made it worse. They moved like ghosts, all of them with faces hidden, eyes down, every gesture cautious. Everyone spoke in muffled tones, careful not to breathe too close, nor to touch too long. The sickness was gone, sure, but the fear, that had stayed. It seeped into the air like smoke from a fire that never really went out.

Mark had recently turned thirty, though lately he had felt a lot older. Just another man in another apartment, doing the same things on the same screens, day after day. Once, not so long ago, he‚Äôd had a life: a commute, coffee breaks, laughter in bars, the buzz of being around people. Now it was just muted voices over video calls and the hollow sound of his own footsteps echoing through empty streets. His world had shrunk to four walls and a dim laptop glow.

When the vaccine had come, it hit the world like a thunderclap. Salvation in a syringe, they promised. The media called it a modern-day miracle, a victory for humankind. The news channels ran stories of doctors smiling, families hugging, the word ‚Äúhope‚Äù flashing across screens like a brand logo. But Mark didn‚Äôt buy it‚Ä¶ at least not completely. It was all too fast, too polished. Science didn‚Äôt work miracles overnight, not without a price. People called the doubters crazy, conspiracists, paranoid. But deep down, Mark knew there was something off, something rotten humming just beneath all the headlines and hashtags.

Still, the pressure to get the jab built. Everyone was doing it: posting selfies with their little vaccine cards, their captions all the same: *We did it. We‚Äôre safe now.* His parents called him every night, voices cracked with worry, telling him just to be responsible and do what needed to be done. Even Lily, his best friend since forever, sent him a message that felt more like an order than advice: *Come on, Mark. Just get it done.*

So, he caved. He booked the appointment. Told himself it was logic, not fear, that made him do it. But that night, as he sat in the dark, the flicker of the TV painted shadows across his face. The anchorwoman smiled a little too widely, her words a little too clean as she rattled off success rates and safety claims. Behind that plastic grin, though, Mark saw something else, something forced. Like everyone had decided to keep pretending things were fine until they finally believed it.

But Mark didn‚Äôt believe it. He knew that he never really had. The world had already cracked, the veneer had gone, and no shot could fix that. Lying awake, the city dead quiet outside, he felt it: that gnawing truth in his gut. This virus was not like the one that had come before, that one that had been a test run for how humanity would react to lockdowns and enforced vaccinations. No, this one really had changed everything, and maybe the cure would change it even more. Maybe this wasn‚Äôt the end of the nightmare. Maybe it was just the start.

¬†

**Part 2: Lily**

Mark got the shot on a dead gray Tuesday afternoon, the kind of day that felt like it had been drained of all color. The clinic was packed tight with bodies, yet no one made a sound. Just rows of masked faces staring ahead, eyes empty, like cattle waiting for slaughter. The air smelled of antiseptic and it felt like you could cut the fear with a knife. A nurse, plastic visor, latex gloves, her voice stripped of even the slightest hint of warmth, called his name. He followed her into a narrow room that felt even colder than the hallway.

The shot itself was nothing. A prick, a flash of sting, and it was done. ‚ÄúYou might feel tired,‚Äù the nurse said, her voice flat, already looking past him to the next in line. ‚ÄúMaybe a little headache. Drink water.‚Äù It was odd: her words sounded rehearsed, like she‚Äôd said them a thousand times and stopped meaning them after the first hundred. To be fair, though, she had probably said them thousands of times, so it was understandable for her to be going through the motions. Mark nodded, rolled down his sleeve, and walked out with a small square of gauze taped to his arm and an ache deep in his gut that had nothing to do with the needle.

That night, the fever well and truly hit: a low, humming heat that crawled up his arm and settled behind his eyes. He lay in bed, sweating, drifting in and out of half-dreams where faces melted and reformed, always watching him. By morning, the fever had broken, but the world didn‚Äôt feel right. The city looked the same, but it wasn‚Äôt. People‚Äôs faces seemed‚Ä¶ unstable. Not enough to notice if you weren‚Äôt looking, but enough to make his skin crawl. Little things, easy to not notice, or ignore even if you did. Eyes that didn‚Äôt quite match the mouth beneath them. Jawlines that seemed to flicker, like reflections on disturbed water.

Within a week, everything had changed again. The streets filled back up, the noise returned, and the news couldn‚Äôt stop calling the vaccine a miracle. Infection rates nosedived, smiles spread, real or otherwise, and people started seeing each other in person again. Hope was well and truly back on the menu. But the fringes of the internet whispered a significantly different story for those who cared to look. Short posts. Deleted videos. Seemingly outrageous claims that people were ‚Äúglitching‚Äù mid-conversation: faces rippling, skin reforming into someone else‚Äôs. The experts we were presented with merely referred to it as trauma, mass hysteria, brain fatigue. Everyone nodded along because, well‚Ä¶ that explanation was easier to swallow.

Mark didn‚Äôt believe any of it‚Ä¶ until Lily.

They met one late afternoon, a pot of coffee steaming between them, the blinds slicing the sunlight into stripes across her living room. For the first time in months, he almost felt human again. Lily was talking about work, about some poor bastard who‚Äôd fainted in a meeting. She laughed, then abruptly stopped. Her eyes locked on his, her face frozen mid-expression.

Then her skin began to crawl.

Not in a metaphorical way‚Ä¶ literally. Her features shifted, her bones seemingly rearranging in tiny, horrifying spasms. Her eyes turned into his eyes. Her lips pressed into his exact shape. His expression, the tight, thoughtful frown he made without realizing, now appeared on her face like a reflection in wet glass.

And when she spoke, it was his voice, or at least a very close approximation of it, that came out.

‚ÄúMark,‚Äù she said, or maybe *he* did‚Ä¶ ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù

His hand trembled. Coffee sloshed against the rim of the cup. The air between them buzzed, like static before lightning. Then, just like that, it was gone. Her face snapped back. Her eyes softened. She blinked, smiled, and kept talking. As if nothing had happened.

Mark forced a nod, but his heart was pounding hard enough to hurt. He pretended to listen, pretended to laugh, but his mind was spiraling.

That night, he didn‚Äôt sleep. He just lay there, watching the shadows crawl across his ceiling, replaying the moment again and again. By sunrise, he was telling himself it was probably just fatigue. A trick of the light. The brain playing games after months of isolation.

But it kept happening. Everywhere. Subtle, quiet, but increasingly constant. A coworker‚Äôs eyes flashing green for a second before returning to brown. A stranger on the subway smiling in sync with another‚Äôs grin like a reflection caught in motion. The patterns multiplied. Faces blurred, overlapped, melted into one another until he couldn‚Äôt tell where one person ended and another began.

And through it all, Mark stayed the same. His reflection never rippled. His features never changed. Whatever the vaccine had done to everyone else, it had skipped him.

He was the last original face in a world full of copies.

**Part 3: The Mimic Phenomenon**

Within a month, the world came apart at the seams. It didn‚Äôt happen all at once: it crept in, like mold spreading under paint, slow and silent until you realized everything was already rotting. What began as small glitches, faces flickering at the edge of your vision, reflections that didn‚Äôt quite line up, turned into something monstrous. Now, people‚Äôs faces didn‚Äôt stay still. They pulsed, morphed, flowed like wet clay trying to remember a shape. Eyes shifted color, mouths warped mid-sentence, and every street looked like a fever dream of half-familiar strangers.

The media tried to make sense of it. They called it *The Mimic Phenomenon.* Experts paraded across TV screens, although their expressions were a little too composed, their words too smooth to trust. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs temporary,‚Äù one said. ‚ÄúA benign neurological response. A kind of visual empathy.‚Äù The phrase spread like disinfectant: clean, sterile, and just plain wrong. Nobody believed it. On the streets, people stopped looking at one another. Conversations died. Windows were covered, mirrors smashed, gatherings outlawed. Cities went quiet again‚Ä¶ only this time, even the silence felt infected.

The government‚Äôs response was one of ¬†panic. Curfews. Mandates. Emergency broadcasts. Masks came back, thicker than before. Posters screamed from every corner: **PROTECT YOUR IDENTITY. STAY SAFE. STAY YOURSELF.** Eye contact was labeled a public health hazard. Even reflections were censored: mirrors were wrapped in black plastic like corpses. It wasn‚Äôt about protecting people anymore. It was about containing the panic.

For Mark, the world had turned into a nightmare with no waking up. He watched people he loved disintegrate behind their faces. His parents, once so different, started to blend into one another until they shared the same mouth, the same dull eyes. They moved in sync, speaking in unison without realizing it. His office turned into a factory of copies: rows of identical grins and mirrored gestures, voices merging into a single drone. And Lily‚Ä¶ she was disappearing piece by piece. Each time he saw her, she looked less like herself. Sometimes she had *his* eyes. Sometimes her voice cracked into *his* tone. Once, she caught her reflection in a window and laughed with a sound that wasn‚Äôt her own.

Mark tried to fight it. He filmed people morphing in public, even recorded Lily mid-shift, but the footage never came out right. Faces smeared, data corrupted, static tearing through every frame. Online, he tried to post about it everywhere he could, to warn others, but the messages always vanished within minutes. Auto-deletions, apparently. ‚ÄúSpreading misinformation,‚Äù the replies said. The internet had turned into another control tool. The truth wasn‚Äôt just being hidden: it was being erased.

So, he went underground. Nights blurred into each other as he dug ever deeper, ¬†tearing through data leaks, encrypted files, government archives, anything that might explain what was happening. What he found froze him to the core. A classified document buried deep in a medical archive: **VIRAL ADAPTATION HYPOTHESIS: HUMAN SUBJECT TRIALS, PHASE 4.** It described something prehistoric: a survival reflex buried in human DNA. Early humans had survived by becoming one another, by mimicking the pack to confuse predators. The vaccine, meant to boost immunity through genetic rewriting, had accidentally flipped that switch back on.

It wasn‚Äôt evolution. It was regression.

Humanity was dissolving into itself.

Mark sat in the dark, the screen‚Äôs blue light flickering over his face. Outside his window, the city moved like a single, breathing organism. He could see them walking under the lamps: figures with faces that bled into one another, melding and separating like smoke. No individuality. No difference. Just a gray tide of flesh and movement.

He touched the window, the chill biting into his hand. For a long time, he just stood there, watching. That‚Äôs when it hit him.

He wasn‚Äôt immune. He was incompatible.

Whatever the vaccine had done to everyone else, it hadn‚Äôt worked on him. He was the flaw in the pattern, the anomaly that couldn‚Äôt blend.

And in a world that worshiped sameness‚Ä¶ that made him dangerous.

**Part 4: Identity differentiation**

It was well past midnight when Mark finally found it: the truth he‚Äôd been clawing toward for weeks. By this point his apartment was a wreck of stale air and cold caffeine, coffee cups crowding the desk beside a laptop that hummed like a dying engine. Outside, the city murmured: a low, restless noise that never really slept.

Lines of code scrolled across the cracked screen, reflected in Mark‚Äôs tired eyes. He‚Äôd broken through a wall of encryption‚Äîgovernment firewalls, proxy servers, and dead-end IPs‚Äîuntil he reached the digital underbelly of the Department of Global Health. A vault of sealed files, never meant to see daylight.

The documents were corrupted, redacted beyond reason, but one phrase kept surfacing like a ghost from the code: **‚ÄúGenetic Cohesion Initiative.‚Äù**

At first, he‚Äôd thought it was just another bureaucratic buzzword, something about herd immunity or vaccine outreach. But the deeper he dug, the colder it got. But this wasn‚Äôt a medical project: it was a controlled experiment‚Ä¶ on humanity itself.

Buried under miles of data, medical reports, and genetic schematics, the truth took shape. The mutation wasn‚Äôt an accident; it had been predicted. Planned, even. The so-called vaccine hadn‚Äôt been built to stop a virus. It had been designed to reshape people. To ‚Äústabilize social structures through biological alignment.‚Äù

They‚Äôd found a gene tied to individuality, identity differentiation, they called it and flipped it. Their logic was equal parts elegant and monstrous: if people were too different, they fought; if they were the same, they‚Äôd obey. By rewriting one strand of DNA, they could dissolve conflict, emotion, and ego; force the species into perfect, docile harmony.

One report stopped his breath cold.

‚ÄúTransformation is likely to become permanent within 3 to 6 weeks of exposure. Subjects exhibit mimicry behavior, loss of self-identity, and eventual cognitive synchronization with surrounding individuals. In high-density areas, full homogenization is expected.‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs chair creaked as he leaned back, staring at the words until they blurred. *Permanent.* *Loss of self.* *Synchronization.* They‚Äôd known. The politicians, the anchors, the doctors‚Ä¶ they‚Äôd all smiled for the cameras while the world quietly rewrote itself from the inside out.

He opened another file, one marked **CLASSIFIED: LEVEL 6 CLEARANCE.** The memo was brief, sterile, signed by someone high enough to stay untouchable.

‚ÄúThe side effects are acceptable. The survival of humanity requires unity over individuality. A world without identity is a world without conflict.‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs stomach twisted. They hadn‚Äôt cured anything. They‚Äôd committed the cleanest genocide in history‚Äîone gene at a time.

A sound snapped through the silence.

*Knock. Knock.*

He froze. Nobody was supposed to be out. The building had been on lockdown for weeks. The knock came again, softer but insistent.

He edged toward the door, heart hammering. Through the peephole, he saw her: Lily. She looked pale under the flickering hallway light, her mask pulled tight, her eyes glassy but aware.

‚ÄúMark?‚Äù she called, voice small, trembling. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre in there. Please‚Ä¶ we need to talk.‚Äù

He hesitated at first and then unlocked the door. She slipped inside like a shadow. Immediately he could tell that her movements were off: everything was too smooth, too deliberate, almost as if she was being remote-controlled.

When she pulled off her mask, Mark‚Äôs breath caught. Her face‚Ä¶ was changing. Not like an illusion, real flesh bending and twitching, her jawline rippling through shapes that weren‚Äôt hers. For a moment, it was his.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm losing myself,‚Äù she whispered. Her voice cracked and warped, sometimes hers, sometimes more like his. ‚ÄúI look at people, and I can‚Äôt tell who I am anymore.‚Äù

He wanted to hold her, to tell her it would be all right. But it wouldn‚Äôt. He knew now; this wasn‚Äôt a sickness. It was the new design.

Tears rolled down her flickering face. Then she smiled. Not her smile‚Ä¶ his.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Mark,‚Äù she said in his voice. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll all be one soon. That‚Äôs what they wanted.‚Äù

Something inside him broke at this. He stumbled backward, shaking, and the world seemed to tilt.

By dawn, he was gone. He packed what little he had and slipped into the streets, where the air itself felt heavy, synchronized, humming with static life.

The city loomed around him like a reflection of itself; faces blurring in the windows, voices blending into one endless echo. And everywhere he looked, the message burned bright across every billboard, every holo-screen, every government feed:

**‚ÄúTogether, we are stronger. Together, we are one.‚Äù**

For the first time, Mark understood.

They hadn‚Äôt united the world.

They‚Äôd erased it.

¬†

**Part 5: The Global Health Directorate**

Mark had followed the trail as far as it would go. Through derelict data vaults, quarantined research wings, and half-rotted files buried under bureaucratic lies, he followed the trail like a ghost tracking the scent of its own death. Every lead drew him deeper into the rot until it ended where it all began: the Global Health Directorate. The building loomed above the dead city like a monument to humanity‚Äôs arrogance: black glass, steel veins, and the faint hum of power still pulsing through its hollow heart.

The streets leading to it were a virtual graveyard. A cold rain fell, slicking the pavement, dripping off the still forms that lined the sidewalks. The mimics stood in perfect silence, heads tilted toward the sky, rainwater pooling in their open palms. Their eyes were empty, their skin wax-pale, their clothes soaked through but untouched by decay. They didn‚Äôt move. They didn‚Äôt breathe. They were waiting ‚Äî like statues waiting for orders from a god that no longer existed.

Inside, the air was cleaner than it had any right to be. The lights burned steady, the elevators still hummed, and the walls gleamed like they were polished yesterday. The building wasn‚Äôt abandoned. It was preserved, maintained by something that no longer needed hands. The digital billboards lining the corridors pulsed with white letters that bled into his vision:

**TOGETHER, WE ARE ONE.**

The phrase echoed down every corridor, mechanical and soft, like a prayer recited by the dead.

At the end of a long marble hallway, he found them, the architects of extinction. Three figures waited in a glass boardroom surrounded by walls of screens. Each display showed shifting faces, human features dissolving into one another until all that remained was a blurred, composite mask. The three stood perfectly still, their features unnaturally symmetrical. They didn‚Äôt look alive. They looked *designed.*

‚ÄúMr. Sinnott,‚Äù said the woman in the center, her voice calm and surgical. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been expecting you.‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs fists clenched at his sides. ‚ÄúYou knew. You *knew* what the vaccine would do.‚Äù

She smiled, or at least something close to a smile. ‚ÄúOf course we did. It was necessary. Humanity has been tearing itself apart for centuries. We removed the disease.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean people,‚Äù he said through his teeth. ‚ÄúYou erased them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said the man to her left, voice low, precise, almost gentle. ‚ÄúWe liberated them. The human condition was flawed‚Ä¶ violent, selfish, fractured. Now, there‚Äôs no more conflict. No more division. One mind. One body. Harmony.‚Äù

Mark shook his head, backing away. ‚ÄúYou turned them into reflections. Empty, thoughtless copies.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmpty?‚Äù The woman stepped closer, her form flickering as if reality couldn‚Äôt decide what shape she should wear. For a second, she looked just like him. Then she wasn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúThey are *complete*, Mark. There is peace now‚Ä¶ real peace. You could join them. It isn‚Äôt too late.‚Äù

For a heartbeat, he almost believed her. There was something intoxicating in the stillness of their voices: a promise of silence, of rest. The endless screaming of the old world had stopped. Maybe this was what humanity had always wanted: quiet. Unity.

But then he saw Lily in his mind‚Ä¶ her face collapsing, her eyes begging him to remember her before she disappeared into the swarm.

He steadied himself. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù he said, his voice hoarse. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt cure us. You killed everything that made us *human*.‚Äù

The lights shifted red. Alarms blared. The figures‚Äô faces twisted, their perfect symmetry was collapsing into chaos. Their skin rippled like liquid, their bodies merging, reforming. Then the three had become one, a mass of flesh and light and flickering human echoes, its voice now a chorus of thousands.

**‚ÄúJOIN US, MARK. YOU WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE ALONE.‚Äù**

And with that, he ran.

Down endless halls of mirrored glass where faceless reflections stared at him. The building shook under the sound of pursuit, hundreds if not thousands of synchronized footsteps pounding like war drums. He burst into what appeared to be some kind of control room. The cacophony of noise caused by his presence told him that this place was of vital importance to this whole situation. Could this be the central hub, the pulse of the network connecting every mimic on Earth, controlling their thoughts?

He didn‚Äôt get the chance to confirm his theory, as the creature behind him twitched. Fractured light crawled across its surface as the voices began to rethread themselves. It wasn‚Äôt gone. Not yet, at least.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt stop evolution,‚Äù it whispered, a thousand voices murmuring in one breath. ‚ÄúYou can only slow it down‚Ä¶ but you will ultimately fail.‚Äù

Mark turned and fled the building. Could the last man with his own face could still save what was left of mankind?

¬†

**Part 6: Harmony achieved**

Mark didn‚Äôt know how long he‚Äôd been running‚Ä¶ hours, days, maybe more. Time had stopped meaning anything. The world above had gone still, eerily still, like someone had hit pause on reality. Cities that once screamed with life now sat hushed, filled with people who moved like ghosts, smiling, synchronized, and soulless.

Everywhere, the same voice echoed, flat and artificial, pumped through the skeleton of civilization:

**‚ÄúHarmony achieved. Conflict resolved. Remain connected.‚Äù**

He lived on instinct now, scavenging from abandoned stores, drinking rainwater off rusted gutters, sleeping wherever the shadows stayed deepest. The trick was to avoid the crowds. Once you looked too long into their eyes, it was over.

Now and then, through the static of an old military radio he‚Äôd acquired, he‚Äôd catch fragments of something human:

‚ÄúIf you can hear this‚Ä¶ come south. We‚Äôre still ourselves. Follow these coordinates‚Äù

That whisper of hope pulled him through wastelands of glass and dust until he found them: the survivors.

They lived beneath the husk of an old power station, buried deep in concrete and shrouded in darkness. Maybe forty of them, tops. All were hollow-eyed, trembling, clinging to what was left of their humanity.

Among them was Dr. Ren, a small woman with dark circles under her eyes and a mind sharp enough to cut glass. Turned out she‚Äôd worked on the original vaccine before realizing what it truly was. When she saw what the Directorate had done, she herself had fled.

Ren told them about one last chance: not a cure, but a counterstrike. There was a frequency that could break the signal binding everyone together: a sonic disruption that might scramble the neural code controlling the mimicry. If they could piggyback it onto the global satellite grid, it might jolt some minds free‚Ä¶ or at least stop the infection from spreading further.

‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a coin toss,‚Äù she warned, voice steady but eyes full of dread. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôll do to those already changed.‚Äù

Mark looked around at the others; faces still unique, still alive, still theirs. ‚ÄúListen, I was there, at the central hub. There‚Äôs no way I could make it back without succumbing to the effects of the vaccine. If we don‚Äôt try this,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthen it‚Äôs already over.‚Äù

They worked like ghosts for days. Nobody spoke much. Cables were spliced, transmitters rewired, power rerouted from the city‚Äôs dying veins. The air down there was hot, thick with sweat. And at night, they‚Äôd hear them, the mimics, roaming above the tunnels in perfect rhythm, hundreds of feet dragging in unison.

When it was ready, they gathered in the control room. The satellite dish above the ruins was aligned, its gears creaking like old bones. Ren‚Äôs fingers shook as she entered the last sequence.

‚ÄúOnce this starts,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthey‚Äôll come for us.‚Äù

Mark chambered a round into the rifle he‚Äôd been supplied with. ‚ÄúThen we make it quick.‚Äù

The countdown began. The screens flared to life, static crawling like lightning across their surfaces. The pulse of the signal built in the wires, a low-frequency growl that made the walls vibrate.

Then came the sound from above.

Footsteps. Thousands of them.

The first impact made the ceiling dust rain down. Then the next. Then a roar of pounding, scraping, breaking. The swarm had found them.

The reinforced doors buckled under the pressure. Pale faces pressed against the glass, identical and empty, eyes wide and glowing with calm devotion.

‚ÄúJoin us,‚Äù they whispered, a perfect choir.

Gunfire tore through the air. The survivors held the line as best they could, brass casings clattering on the concrete floor. People screamed, then vanished into the mass. Mark saw bodies pulled apart, swallowed by the human tide.

Ren shouted over the noise, ‚ÄúThe signal‚Äôs live!‚Äù

Then the door gave way. She was dragged into the flood of bodies, her scream dissolving into the echo of their chant. Mark threw himself at the console, and slammed the override.

The world exploded in white.

The frequency wasn‚Äôt sound anymore, it was inside him. A vibration that ripped through his bones, his blood, his mind. It felt like being erased one atom at a time.

Then‚Ä¶ silence.

When Mark opened his eyes, everything was still. The mimics stood frozen mid-step, faces blank but solid, no longer shifting, no longer changing.

He stumbled through the wreckage. The survivors lay scattered, eyes open, yet unseeing. Even Ren was the same, caught mid-motion, her hand reaching for the console, expression locked in eternal terror.

He called out to her. Nothing. He called again. The echoes came back hollow, fading into the tunnels.

That‚Äôs when it hit him.

The signal had worked. but not the way they‚Äôd hoped. The transformation was over, but so was everything else. The infection was gone, yes, but so were their minds. Humanity hadn‚Äôt been saved. It had been paused.

He sank to his knees, light from the dying monitors painting his shadow across the wall. Above him, the world would be the same, frozen people standing in the streets, locked in the last thought they‚Äôd ever had.

Mark was alone again. But this time, the quiet wasn‚Äôt mercy.

¬†

**Part 7: The new world**

The world above was dead quiet.

When Mark climbed out of the tunnel, he expected panic: sirens, screaming, the echo of some last stand. Instead, there was nothing. Just still air and the heavy silence of a world that had stopped breathing. The streets stretched out in perfect order, cars parked in straight, obedient lines, doors hanging open like gaping mouths. Engines had long gone cold.

And the people, if you could still call them that, filled the sidewalks. Dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands. Frozen mid-step, mid-scream, mid-thought. Their faces locked between terror and peace, as if caught halfway through surrender.

The signal had done its job.

Mark moved carefully among them, afraid to touch. Their eyes were open but empty, glossy mirrors reflecting the pale red sun bleeding out behind the clouds. Each one unique, yet eerily the same, as though individuality had been sculpted into a single, perfect lie. The city had become a museum of humanity at the moment of its extinction.

‚ÄúTogether,‚Äù he muttered, voice cracking in the cold air. ‚ÄúExactly what they wanted.‚Äù

He wandered for hours. Or maybe days: time meant nothing now. His footsteps echoed off concrete and glass, the only sound left. Stores were stocked, homes untouched, offices frozen in mid-routine, the coffee cups were still steaming faintly in his imagination. Radios hissed with static. Screens stared back blank and blind. Even the sky seemed muted, the birds gone, the wind refusing to move.

It was a dead world pretending to still exist.

Mark stopped outside a shattered storefront. Behind the cracked glass, a dusty mirror leaned crookedly against the wall. He saw himself reflected in it: gaunt, hollow-eyed, but still breathing. The only thing that still moved.

He stepped closer, drawn to the one thing that proved he was still real. ‚ÄúAt least I‚Äôm still me,‚Äù he whispered.

But then his reflection blinked.

Not with him‚Ä¶ after him.

He froze. His heartbeat kicked hard against his ribs. The reflection‚Äôs lips began to twitch upward into a grin, slow and deliberate, until it was smiling at him. Not a kind smile; something colder, knowing, wrong. The eyes weren‚Äôt his anymore. They looked like someone else‚Äôs, like something else had taken root behind them.

Mark stumbled back, but the reflection stayed where it was, watching him. Its features rippled, as if testing shapes, trying on new faces beneath his skin.

Then, faintly, impossibly‚Ä¶ a whisper slid out from the glass, a sound more like breath than speech.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù it said in a voice almost identical to his own. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll join us soon.‚Äù

Mark turned and ran.

And as he did, the silence broke. Not with sound, but with movement.

The statues, all those still, frozen bodies, had turned. Every face in the city, every empty stare, was now pointed at him.",3,1761838078.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

**Part 1: The Vaccine**

The world wasn‚Äôt what it used to be. It was a shell: empty, brittle, and scarred by something that couldn‚Äôt be seen anymore but still lingered everywhere. The virus had torn through everything; cities, families, nations, leaving behind silence where there used to be commotion and clatter. Streets once alive with chatter were now hollow canyons of concrete and fading memory. It wasn‚Äôt that there was no longer anyone around. In fact, it was the people who made it worse. They moved like ghosts, all of them with faces hidden, eyes down, every gesture cautious. Everyone spoke in muffled tones, careful not to breathe too close, nor to touch too long. The sickness was gone, sure, but the fear, that had stayed. It seeped into the air like smoke from a fire that never really went out.

Mark had recently turned thirty, though lately he had felt a lot older. Just another man in another apartment, doing the same things on the same screens, day after day. Once, not so long ago, he‚Äôd had a life: a commute, coffee breaks, laughter in bars, the buzz of being around people. Now it was just muted voices over video calls and the hollow sound of his own footsteps echoing through empty streets. His world had shrunk to four walls and a dim laptop glow.

When the vaccine had come, it hit the world like a thunderclap. Salvation in a syringe, they promised. The media called it a modern-day miracle, a victory for humankind. The news channels ran stories of doctors smiling, families hugging, the word ‚Äúhope‚Äù flashing across screens like a brand logo. But Mark didn‚Äôt buy it‚Ä¶ at least not completely. It was all too fast, too polished. Science didn‚Äôt work miracles overnight, not without a price. People called the doubters crazy, conspiracists, paranoid. But deep down, Mark knew there was something off, something rotten humming just beneath all the headlines and hashtags.

Still, the pressure to get the jab built. Everyone was doing it: posting selfies with their little vaccine cards, their captions all the same: *We did it. We‚Äôre safe now.* His parents called him every night, voices cracked with worry, telling him just to be responsible and do what needed to be done. Even Lily, his best friend since forever, sent him a message that felt more like an order than advice: *Come on, Mark. Just get it done.*

So, he caved. He booked the appointment. Told himself it was logic, not fear, that made him do it. But that night, as he sat in the dark, the flicker of the TV painted shadows across his face. The anchorwoman smiled a little too widely, her words a little too clean as she rattled off success rates and safety claims. Behind that plastic grin, though, Mark saw something else, something forced. Like everyone had decided to keep pretending things were fine until they finally believed it.

But Mark didn‚Äôt believe it. He knew that he never really had. The world had already cracked, the veneer had gone, and no shot could fix that. Lying awake, the city dead quiet outside, he felt it: that gnawing truth in his gut. This virus was not like the one that had come before, that one that had been a test run for how humanity would react to lockdowns and enforced vaccinations. No, this one really had changed everything, and maybe the cure would change it even more. Maybe this wasn‚Äôt the end of the nightmare. Maybe it was just the start.

¬†

**Part 2: Lily**

Mark got the shot on a dead gray Tuesday afternoon, the kind of day that felt like it had been drained of all color. The clinic was packed tight with bodies, yet no one made a sound. Just rows of masked faces staring ahead, eyes empty, like cattle waiting for slaughter. The air smelled of antiseptic and it felt like you could cut the fear with a knife. A nurse, plastic visor, latex gloves, her voice stripped of even the slightest hint of warmth, called his name. He followed her into a narrow room that felt even colder than the hallway.

The shot itself was nothing. A prick, a flash of sting, and it was done. ‚ÄúYou might feel tired,‚Äù the nurse said, her voice flat, already looking past him to the next in line. ‚ÄúMaybe a little headache. Drink water.‚Äù It was odd: her words sounded rehearsed, like she‚Äôd said them a thousand times and stopped meaning them after the first hundred. To be fair, though, she had probably said them thousands of times, so it was understandable for her to be going through the motions. Mark nodded, rolled down his sleeve, and walked out with a small square of gauze taped to his arm and an ache deep in his gut that had nothing to do with the needle.

That night, the fever well and truly hit: a low, humming heat that crawled up his arm and settled behind his eyes. He lay in bed, sweating, drifting in and out of half-dreams where faces melted and reformed, always watching him. By morning, the fever had broken, but the world didn‚Äôt feel right. The city looked the same, but it wasn‚Äôt. People‚Äôs faces seemed‚Ä¶ unstable. Not enough to notice if you weren‚Äôt looking, but enough to make his skin crawl. Little things, easy to not notice, or ignore even if you did. Eyes that didn‚Äôt quite match the mouth beneath them. Jawlines that seemed to flicker, like reflections on disturbed water.

Within a week, everything had changed again. The streets filled back up, the noise returned, and the news couldn‚Äôt stop calling the vaccine a miracle. Infection rates nosedived, smiles spread, real or otherwise, and people started seeing each other in person again. Hope was well and truly back on the menu. But the fringes of the internet whispered a significantly different story for those who cared to look. Short posts. Deleted videos. Seemingly outrageous claims that people were ‚Äúglitching‚Äù mid-conversation: faces rippling, skin reforming into someone else‚Äôs. The experts we were presented with merely referred to it as trauma, mass hysteria, brain fatigue. Everyone nodded along because, well‚Ä¶ that explanation was easier to swallow.

Mark didn‚Äôt believe any of it‚Ä¶ until Lily.

They met one late afternoon, a pot of coffee steaming between them, the blinds slicing the sunlight into stripes across her living room. For the first time in months, he almost felt human again. Lily was talking about work, about some poor bastard who‚Äôd fainted in a meeting. She laughed, then abruptly stopped. Her eyes locked on his, her face frozen mid-expression.

Then her skin began to crawl.

Not in a metaphorical way‚Ä¶ literally. Her features shifted, her bones seemingly rearranging in tiny, horrifying spasms. Her eyes turned into his eyes. Her lips pressed into his exact shape. His expression, the tight, thoughtful frown he made without realizing, now appeared on her face like a reflection in wet glass.

And when she spoke, it was his voice, or at least a very close approximation of it, that came out.

‚ÄúMark,‚Äù she said, or maybe *he* did‚Ä¶ ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù

His hand trembled. Coffee sloshed against the rim of the cup. The air between them buzzed, like static before lightning. Then, just like that, it was gone. Her face snapped back. Her eyes softened. She blinked, smiled, and kept talking. As if nothing had happened.

Mark forced a nod, but his heart was pounding hard enough to hurt. He pretended to listen, pretended to laugh, but his mind was spiraling.

That night, he didn‚Äôt sleep. He just lay there, watching the shadows crawl across his ceiling, replaying the moment again and again. By sunrise, he was telling himself it was probably just fatigue. A trick of the light. The brain playing games after months of isolation.

But it kept happening. Everywhere. Subtle, quiet, but increasingly constant. A coworker‚Äôs eyes flashing green for a second before returning to brown. A stranger on the subway smiling in sync with another‚Äôs grin like a reflection caught in motion. The patterns multiplied. Faces blurred, overlapped, melted into one another until he couldn‚Äôt tell where one person ended and another began.

And through it all, Mark stayed the same. His reflection never rippled. His features never changed. Whatever the vaccine had done to everyone else, it had skipped him.

He was the last original face in a world full of copies.

**Part 3: The Mimic Phenomenon**

Within a month, the world came apart at the seams. It didn‚Äôt happen all at once: it crept in, like mold spreading under paint, slow and silent until you realized everything was already rotting. What began as small glitches, faces flickering at the edge of your vision, reflections that didn‚Äôt quite line up, turned into something monstrous. Now, people‚Äôs faces didn‚Äôt stay still. They pulsed, morphed, flowed like wet clay trying to remember a shape. Eyes shifted color, mouths warped mid-sentence, and every street looked like a fever dream of half-familiar strangers.

The media tried to make sense of it. They called it *The Mimic Phenomenon.* Experts paraded across TV screens, although their expressions were a little too composed, their words too smooth to trust. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs temporary,‚Äù one said. ‚ÄúA benign neurological response. A kind of visual empathy.‚Äù The phrase spread like disinfectant: clean, sterile, and just plain wrong. Nobody believed it. On the streets, people stopped looking at one another. Conversations died. Windows were covered, mirrors smashed, gatherings outlawed. Cities went quiet again‚Ä¶ only this time, even the silence felt infected.

The government‚Äôs response was one of ¬†panic. Curfews. Mandates. Emergency broadcasts. Masks came back, thicker than before. Posters screamed from every corner: **PROTECT YOUR IDENTITY. STAY SAFE. STAY YOURSELF.** Eye contact was labeled a public health hazard. Even reflections were censored: mirrors were wrapped in black plastic like corpses. It wasn‚Äôt about protecting people anymore. It was about containing the panic.

For Mark, the world had turned into a nightmare with no waking up. He watched people he loved disintegrate behind their faces. His parents, once so different, started to blend into one another until they shared the same mouth, the same dull eyes. They moved in sync, speaking in unison without realizing it. His office turned into a factory of copies: rows of identical grins and mirrored gestures, voices merging into a single drone. And Lily‚Ä¶ she was disappearing piece by piece. Each time he saw her, she looked less like herself. Sometimes she had *his* eyes. Sometimes her voice cracked into *his* tone. Once, she caught her reflection in a window and laughed with a sound that wasn‚Äôt her own.

Mark tried to fight it. He filmed people morphing in public, even recorded Lily mid-shift, but the footage never came out right. Faces smeared, data corrupted, static tearing through every frame. Online, he tried to post about it everywhere he could, to warn others, but the messages always vanished within minutes. Auto-deletions, apparently. ‚ÄúSpreading misinformation,‚Äù the replies said. The internet had turned into another control tool. The truth wasn‚Äôt just being hidden: it was being erased.

So, he went underground. Nights blurred into each other as he dug ever deeper, ¬†tearing through data leaks, encrypted files, government archives, anything that might explain what was happening. What he found froze him to the core. A classified document buried deep in a medical archive: **VIRAL ADAPTATION HYPOTHESIS: HUMAN SUBJECT TRIALS, PHASE 4.** It described something prehistoric: a survival reflex buried in human DNA. Early humans had survived by becoming one another, by mimicking the pack to confuse predators. The vaccine, meant to boost immunity through genetic rewriting, had accidentally flipped that switch back on.

It wasn‚Äôt evolution. It was regression.

Humanity was dissolving into itself.

Mark sat in the dark, the screen‚Äôs blue light flickering over his face. Outside his window, the city moved like a single, breathing organism. He could see them walking under the lamps: figures with faces that bled into one another, melding and separating like smoke. No individuality. No difference. Just a gray tide of flesh and movement.

He touched the window, the chill biting into his hand. For a long time, he just stood there, watching. That‚Äôs when it hit him.

He wasn‚Äôt immune. He was incompatible.

Whatever the vaccine had done to everyone else, it hadn‚Äôt worked on him. He was the flaw in the pattern, the anomaly that couldn‚Äôt blend.

And in a world that worshiped sameness‚Ä¶ that made him dangerous.

¬†

**Part 4: Identity differentiation**

It was well past midnight when Mark finally found it: the truth he‚Äôd been clawing toward for weeks. By this point his apartment was a wreck of stale air and cold caffeine, coffee cups crowding the desk beside a laptop that hummed like a dying engine. Outside, the city murmured: a low, restless noise that never really slept.

Lines of code scrolled across the cracked screen, reflected in Mark‚Äôs tired eyes. He‚Äôd broken through a wall of encryption‚Äîgovernment firewalls, proxy servers, and dead-end IPs‚Äîuntil he reached the digital underbelly of the Department of Global Health. A vault of sealed files, never meant to see daylight.

The documents were corrupted, redacted beyond reason, but one phrase kept surfacing like a ghost from the code: **‚ÄúGenetic Cohesion Initiative.‚Äù**

At first, he‚Äôd thought it was just another bureaucratic buzzword, something about herd immunity or vaccine outreach. But the deeper he dug, the colder it got. But this wasn‚Äôt a medical project: it was a controlled experiment‚Ä¶ on humanity itself.

Buried under miles of data, medical reports, and genetic schematics, the truth took shape. The mutation wasn‚Äôt an accident; it had been predicted. Planned, even. The so-called vaccine hadn‚Äôt been built to stop a virus. It had been designed to reshape people. To ‚Äústabilize social structures through biological alignment.‚Äù

They‚Äôd found a gene tied to individuality, identity differentiation, they called it and flipped it. Their logic was equal parts elegant and monstrous: if people were too different, they fought; if they were the same, they‚Äôd obey. By rewriting one strand of DNA, they could dissolve conflict, emotion, and ego; force the species into perfect, docile harmony.

One report stopped his breath cold.

‚ÄúTransformation is likely to become permanent within 3 to 6 weeks of exposure. Subjects exhibit mimicry behavior, loss of self-identity, and eventual cognitive synchronization with surrounding individuals. In high-density areas, full homogenization is expected.‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs chair creaked as he leaned back, staring at the words until they blurred. *Permanent.* *Loss of self.* *Synchronization.* They‚Äôd known. The politicians, the anchors, the doctors‚Ä¶ they‚Äôd all smiled for the cameras while the world quietly rewrote itself from the inside out.

He opened another file, one marked **CLASSIFIED: LEVEL 6 CLEARANCE.** The memo was brief, sterile, signed by someone high enough to stay untouchable.

‚ÄúThe side effects are acceptable. The survival of humanity requires unity over individuality. A world without identity is a world without conflict.‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs stomach twisted. They hadn‚Äôt cured anything. They‚Äôd committed the cleanest genocide in history‚Äîone gene at a time.

A sound snapped through the silence.

*Knock. Knock.*

He froze. Nobody was supposed to be out. The building had been on lockdown for weeks. The knock came again, softer but insistent.

He edged toward the door, heart hammering. Through the peephole, he saw her: Lily. She looked pale under the flickering hallway light, her mask pulled tight, her eyes glassy but aware.

‚ÄúMark?‚Äù she called, voice small, trembling. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre in there. Please‚Ä¶ we need to talk.‚Äù

He hesitated at first and then unlocked the door. She slipped inside like a shadow. Immediately he could tell that her movements were off: everything was too smooth, too deliberate, almost as if she was being remote-controlled.

When she pulled off her mask, Mark‚Äôs breath caught. Her face‚Ä¶ was changing. Not like an illusion, real flesh bending and twitching, her jawline rippling through shapes that weren‚Äôt hers. For a moment, it was his.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm losing myself,‚Äù she whispered. Her voice cracked and warped, sometimes hers, sometimes more like his. ‚ÄúI look at people, and I can‚Äôt tell who I am anymore.‚Äù

He wanted to hold her, to tell her it would be all right. But it wouldn‚Äôt. He knew now; this wasn‚Äôt a sickness. It was the new design.

Tears rolled down her flickering face. Then she smiled. Not her smile‚Ä¶ his.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Mark,‚Äù she said in his voice. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll all be one soon. That‚Äôs what they wanted.‚Äù

Something inside him broke at this. He stumbled backward, shaking, and the world seemed to tilt.

By dawn, he was gone. He packed what little he had and slipped into the streets, where the air itself felt heavy, synchronized, humming with static life.

The city loomed around him like a reflection of itself; faces blurring in the windows, voices blending into one endless echo. And everywhere he looked, the message burned bright across every billboard, every holo-screen, every government feed:

**‚ÄúTogether, we are stronger. Together, we are one.‚Äù**

For the first time, Mark understood.

They hadn‚Äôt united the world.

They‚Äôd erased it.

¬†

**Part 5: The Global Health Directorate**

Mark had followed the trail as far as it would go. Through derelict data vaults, quarantined research wings, and half-rotted files buried under bureaucratic lies, he followed the trail like a ghost tracking the scent of its own death. Every lead drew him deeper into the rot until it ended where it all began: the Global Health Directorate. The building loomed above the dead city like a monument to humanity‚Äôs arrogance: black glass, steel veins, and the faint hum of power still pulsing through its hollow heart.

The streets leading to it were a virtual graveyard. A cold rain fell, slicking the pavement, dripping off the still forms that lined the sidewalks. The mimics stood in perfect silence, heads tilted toward the sky, rainwater pooling in their open palms. Their eyes were empty, their skin wax-pale, their clothes soaked through but untouched by decay. They didn‚Äôt move. They didn‚Äôt breathe. They were waiting ‚Äî like statues waiting for orders from a god that no longer existed.

Inside, the air was cleaner than it had any right to be. The lights burned steady, the elevators still hummed, and the walls gleamed like they were polished yesterday. The building wasn‚Äôt abandoned. It was preserved, maintained by something that no longer needed hands. The digital billboards lining the corridors pulsed with white letters that bled into his vision:

**TOGETHER, WE ARE ONE.**

The phrase echoed down every corridor, mechanical and soft, like a prayer recited by the dead.

At the end of a long marble hallway, he found them, the architects of extinction. Three figures waited in a glass boardroom surrounded by walls of screens. Each display showed shifting faces, human features dissolving into one another until all that remained was a blurred, composite mask. The three stood perfectly still, their features unnaturally symmetrical. They didn‚Äôt look alive. They looked *designed.*

‚ÄúMr. Sinnott,‚Äù said the woman in the center, her voice calm and surgical. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been expecting you.‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs fists clenched at his sides. ‚ÄúYou knew. You *knew* what the vaccine would do.‚Äù

She smiled, or at least something close to a smile. ‚ÄúOf course we did. It was necessary. Humanity has been tearing itself apart for centuries. We removed the disease.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean people,‚Äù he said through his teeth. ‚ÄúYou erased them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said the man to her left, voice low, precise, almost gentle. ‚ÄúWe liberated them. The human condition was flawed‚Ä¶ violent, selfish, fractured. Now, there‚Äôs no more conflict. No more division. One mind. One body. Harmony.‚Äù

Mark shook his head, backing away. ‚ÄúYou turned them into reflections. Empty, thoughtless copies.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmpty?‚Äù The woman stepped closer, her form flickering as if reality couldn‚Äôt decide what shape she should wear. For a second, she looked just like him. Then she wasn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúThey are *complete*, Mark. There is peace now‚Ä¶ real peace. You could join them. It isn‚Äôt too late.‚Äù

For a heartbeat, he almost believed her. There was something intoxicating in the stillness of their voices: a promise of silence, of rest. The endless screaming of the old world had stopped. Maybe this was what humanity had always wanted: quiet. Unity.

But then he saw Lily in his mind‚Ä¶ her face collapsing, her eyes begging him to remember her before she disappeared into the swarm.

He steadied himself. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù he said, his voice hoarse. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt cure us. You killed everything that made us *human*.‚Äù

The lights shifted red. Alarms blared. The figures‚Äô faces twisted, their perfect symmetry was collapsing into chaos. Their skin rippled like liquid, their bodies merging, reforming. Then the three had become one, a mass of flesh and light and flickering human echoes, its voice now a chorus of thousands.

**‚ÄúJOIN US, MARK. YOU WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE ALONE.‚Äù**

And with that, he ran.

Down endless halls of mirrored glass where faceless reflections stared at him. The building shook under the sound of pursuit, hundreds if not thousands of synchronized footsteps pounding like war drums. He burst into what appeared to be some kind of control room. The cacophony of noise caused by his presence told him that this place was of vital importance to this whole situation. Could this be the central hub, the pulse of the network connecting every mimic on Earth, controlling their thoughts?

He didn‚Äôt get the chance to confirm his theory, as the creature behind him twitched. Fractured light crawled across its surface as the voices began to rethread themselves. It wasn‚Äôt gone. Not yet, at least.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt stop evolution,‚Äù it whispered, a thousand voices murmuring in one breath. ‚ÄúYou can only slow it down‚Ä¶ but you will ultimately fail.‚Äù

Mark turned and fled the building. Could the last man with his own face could still save what was left of mankind?

¬†

**Part 6: Harmony achieved**

Mark didn‚Äôt know how long he‚Äôd been running‚Ä¶ hours, days, maybe more. Time had stopped meaning anything. The world above had gone still, eerily still, like someone had hit pause on reality. Cities that once screamed with life now sat hushed, filled with people who moved like ghosts, smiling, synchronized, and soulless.

Everywhere, the same voice echoed, flat and artificial, pumped through the skeleton of civilization:

**‚ÄúHarmony achieved. Conflict resolved. Remain connected.‚Äù**

He lived on instinct now, scavenging from abandoned stores, drinking rainwater off rusted gutters, sleeping wherever the shadows stayed deepest. The trick was to avoid the crowds. Once you looked too long into their eyes, it was over.

Now and then, through the static of an old military radio he‚Äôd acquired, he‚Äôd catch fragments of something human:

‚ÄúIf you can hear this‚Ä¶ come south. We‚Äôre still ourselves. Follow these coordinates‚Äù

That whisper of hope pulled him through wastelands of glass and dust until he found them: the survivors.

They lived beneath the husk of an old power station, buried deep in concrete and shrouded in darkness. Maybe forty of them, tops. All were hollow-eyed, trembling, clinging to what was left of their humanity.

Among them was Dr. Ren, a small woman with dark circles under her eyes and a mind sharp enough to cut glass. Turned out she‚Äôd worked on the original vaccine before realizing what it truly was. When she saw what the Directorate had done, she herself had fled.

Ren told them about one last chance: not a cure, but a counterstrike. There was a frequency that could break the signal binding everyone together: a sonic disruption that might scramble the neural code controlling the mimicry. If they could piggyback it onto the global satellite grid, it might jolt some minds free‚Ä¶ or at least stop the infection from spreading further.

‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a coin toss,‚Äù she warned, voice steady but eyes full of dread. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôll do to those already changed.‚Äù

Mark looked around at the others; faces still unique, still alive, still theirs. ‚ÄúListen, I was there, at the central hub. There‚Äôs no way I could make it back without succumbing to the effects of the vaccine. If we don‚Äôt try this,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthen it‚Äôs already over.‚Äù

They worked like ghosts for days. Nobody spoke much. Cables were spliced, transmitters rewired, power rerouted from the city‚Äôs dying veins. The air down there was hot, thick with sweat. And at night, they‚Äôd hear them, the mimics, roaming above the tunnels in perfect rhythm, hundreds of feet dragging in unison.

When it was ready, they gathered in the control room. The satellite dish above the ruins was aligned, its gears creaking like old bones. Ren‚Äôs fingers shook as she entered the last sequence.

‚ÄúOnce this starts,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthey‚Äôll come for us.‚Äù

Mark chambered a round into the rifle he‚Äôd been supplied with. ‚ÄúThen we make it quick.‚Äù

The countdown began. The screens flared to life, static crawling like lightning across their surfaces. The pulse of the signal built in the wires, a low-frequency growl that made the walls vibrate.

Then came the sound from above.

Footsteps. Thousands of them.

The first impact made the ceiling dust rain down. Then the next. Then a roar of pounding, scraping, breaking. The swarm had found them.

The reinforced doors buckled under the pressure. Pale faces pressed against the glass, identical and empty, eyes wide and glowing with calm devotion.

‚ÄúJoin us,‚Äù they whispered, a perfect choir.

Gunfire tore through the air. The survivors held the line as best they could, brass casings clattering on the concrete floor. People screamed, then vanished into the mass. Mark saw bodies pulled apart, swallowed by the human tide.

Ren shouted over the noise, ‚ÄúThe signal‚Äôs live!‚Äù

Then the door gave way. She was dragged into the flood of bodies, her scream dissolving into the echo of their chant. Mark threw himself at the console, and slammed the override.

The world exploded in white.

The frequency wasn‚Äôt sound anymore, it was inside him. A vibration that ripped through his bones, his blood, his mind. It felt like being erased one atom at a time.

Then‚Ä¶ silence.

When Mark opened his eyes, everything was still. The mimics stood frozen mid-step, faces blank but solid, no longer shifting, no longer changing.

He stumbled through the wreckage. The survivors lay scattered, eyes open, yet unseeing. Even Ren was the same, caught mid-motion, her hand reaching for the console, expression locked in eternal terror.

He called out to her. Nothing. He called again. The echoes came back hollow, fading into the tunnels.

That‚Äôs when it hit him.

The signal had worked. but not the way they‚Äôd hoped. The transformation was over, but so was everything else. The infection was gone, yes, but so were their minds. Humanity hadn‚Äôt been saved. It had been paused.

He sank to his knees, light from the dying monitors painting his shadow across the wall. Above him, the world would be the same, frozen people standing in the streets, locked in the last thought they‚Äôd ever had.

Mark was alone again. But this time, the quiet wasn‚Äôt mercy.

¬†

**Part 7: The new world**

The world above was dead quiet.

When Mark climbed out of the tunnel, he expected panic: sirens, screaming, the echo of some last stand. Instead, there was nothing. Just still air and the heavy silence of a world that had stopped breathing. The streets stretched out in perfect order, cars parked in straight, obedient lines, doors hanging open like gaping mouths. Engines had long gone cold.

And the people, if you could still call them that, filled the sidewalks. Dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands. Frozen mid-step, mid-scream, mid-thought. Their faces locked between terror and peace, as if caught halfway through surrender.

The signal had done its job.

Mark moved carefully among them, afraid to touch. Their eyes were open but empty, glossy mirrors reflecting the pale red sun bleeding out behind the clouds. Each one unique, yet eerily the same, as though individuality had been sculpted into a single, perfect lie. The city had become a museum of humanity at the moment of its extinction.

‚ÄúTogether,‚Äù he muttered, voice cracking in the cold air. ‚ÄúExactly what they wanted.‚Äù

He wandered for hours. Or maybe days: time meant nothing now. His footsteps echoed off concrete and glass, the only sound left. Stores were stocked, homes untouched, offices frozen in mid-routine, the coffee cups were still steaming faintly in his imagination. Radios hissed with static. Screens stared back blank and blind. Even the sky seemed muted, the birds gone, the wind refusing to move.

It was a dead world pretending to still exist.

Mark stopped outside a shattered storefront. Behind the cracked glass, a dusty mirror leaned crookedly against the wall. He saw himself reflected in it: gaunt, hollow-eyed, but still breathing. The only thing that still moved.

He stepped closer, drawn to the one thing that proved he was still real. ‚ÄúAt least I‚Äôm still me,‚Äù he whispered.

But then his reflection blinked.

Not with him‚Ä¶ after him.

He froze. His heartbeat kicked hard against his ribs. The reflection‚Äôs lips began to twitch upward into a grin, slow and deliberate, until it was smiling at him. Not a kind smile; something colder, knowing, wrong. The eyes weren‚Äôt his anymore. They looked like someone else‚Äôs, like something else had taken root behind them.

Mark stumbled back, but the reflection stayed where it was, watching him. Its features rippled, as if testing shapes, trying on new faces beneath his skin.

Then, faintly, impossibly‚Ä¶ a whisper slid out from the glass, a sound more like breath than speech.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù it said in a voice almost identical to his own. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll join us soon.‚Äù

Mark turned and ran.

And as he did, the silence broke. Not with sound, but with movement.

The statues, all those still, frozen bodies, had turned. Every face in the city, every empty stare, was now pointed at him.",2,1761837965.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Went back to basics. Picked 7 simple daily habits and tracked them for 3 weeks to see which ones actually matter.

**The 7 habits:**
- Same wake time every day
- Coffee + breakfast
- One productive task (doesn't matter how small)
- Movement (even 10 minutes)
- Eat lunch (yes, this counts)
- 10-min evening walk or stretch
- Phone away 30min before bed

**Results after 3 weeks:**

Days I hit 5-6 of these: Felt good, clear-headed, low anxiety
Days I hit <3 of these: Felt like garbage

**Biggest insights:**

1. **Small consistent beats big inconsistent** - The ""productive task"" could be answering one email. Didn't matter. The consistency mattered.

2. **Missing 1-2 is fine. Missing 3+ = spiral starts** - This was the key finding. One bad day is recoverable. Three becomes a pattern.

3. **Movement had biggest impact** - Even 10 minutes. This one activity correlated most with good days.

4. **Weekends need structure too** - Learned this the hard way. ""Rest day"" became ""chaos day"" real quick.

**What I'm doing differently now:**

- Focus on 5-6 daily, not perfection
- Track it (I forget otherwise)
- If I miss 2 days, I reset hard on day 3

If you're overwhelmed by complex productivity systems, try this. Pick 5-7 stupidly simple daily things. Track them for 2 weeks. See what actually correlates with good days.

1ok2g6y,https://i.redd.it/3e625wqzm9yf1.jpeg,Moe Rant,"Welcome to my rant sponsored by my coffee deprived brain.

For starters it was triggered by this mention in the discord server and it got me thinking about how you really define a moe's purity based solely on their service life. 
Maus is one of many unused tanks who is probably most pure because she's had a total of 0 official crews assigned to her. Meanwhile many tanks have multiple crews assigned to them.
The only other somewhat pure tank I can think of is Tiger 131, since I don't really know how many crews she's had in her life I assume it's a small number, which is better than the number of crews Shermans may have had.
 But number of crews a tank has had isn't the sole justification for purity so I have to add another factor which is the question of
Do Moe's even form attachments to a specific crew and that when they receive a new one it makes them feel as if they're cheating?
The same applies to when a crew member dies inside them
One example I could give is the Sherman ""In the Mood"" famously commanded by Lafayette Greenpool or known by his moniker ""War Daddy"" would be hella traumatized especially when he dumped the old Sherman in the river because he wanted the newer Shermans (yeah, he liked the newer 76mm Shermans when he got a taste of ""In the Mood II"" and when he was told to use ""in the mood I"" he dumped the tank in a river and subsequently received ""In The Mood 3"")
So further more I believe that Shermans and Panzer IV's would be the most traumatized and impure moe's(impure in the fact they've gone through more crews than they wanted in the span of the war, poor things)
The Tigers and Panthers aren't so lucky either, because even though I believe they had less crew changes they still didn't get off lucky since most were abandoned and destroyed to prevent capture, which undoubtedly gives them abandonment anxiety.

Whether you want to admit it or not, every moe will have some sort of trauma or impurity, but should by no means be called vulgar or degrading language.

The vibe was dark billionaire erotica bordering on ‚Äúthis man needs therapy, not a girlfriend.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs what I remember (in between blushing):

MMC = rich, hot, mean as hell. Full alpha, emotionally unavailable, and definitely had a private library she shouldn‚Äôt have survived.

FMC = sweet and sheltered rich girl who rebels hard.

He was engaged to her older sister at first (yep, messy), but ends up having a wild affair with the younger sister.

She eventually runs away from her family, lives in a small flat, and works at events serving drinks when she bumps into him again.

They start an affair that‚Äôs kinky (he slaps her lightly during sex; she‚Äôs into it).

There‚Äôs a scene where she‚Äôs hanging out at his house, in his library, wearing nothing but a T-shirt and socks.

By book 5, something explodes (emotionally, not literally, though maybe both), she runs away again, and he chases her down.

The covers were abstract‚Äîlike swirly, artsy patterns in deep reds and oranges, not people or faces.

The titles were all one word (I think).

It‚Äôs not Fifty Shades, not Hacker by Meredith Wild, not Filthy Rich Americans by Nikki Sloane, and not Sinners of Saint by L.J. Shen.

I‚Äôve been recently diagnosed with type two (like, seven days ago today) and I‚Äôve been monitoring my glucose via machine, and I‚Äôve seen some kinda scary numbers. For context, I woke up today and my fasting was 197. I am seeing so much different information about what I can and can‚Äôt eat, what will kill me what won‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs all super confusing. 

I found out my A1C is currently 11, which I understand is high (I think) but I don‚Äôt feel any symptoms of highs or lows. When I got diagnosed I was admitted to the er for a kidney infection (which they said might also have brought up my sugar level and or been caused by the high sugar) (I was at 400 something) 

Because I‚Äôm on metformin, I don‚Äôt have a way to like, bolster if my blood sugar is high. What should I do when I see a high number before eating/after fast in the morning? Do I skip the meal? Go for a walk? 

For example, rn I just had a coffee which shouldn‚Äôt spike anything, but apparently they put the wrong sweetener, because I‚Äôm at 250. I was in class so I left and walked around a bit, but I haven‚Äôt eaten yet (was going to after class) do I skip the meal because it‚Äôs high?? 

I‚Äôve seen a pcp, and they said I don‚Äôt need an endo (because they‚Äôre apparently certified but idk) and I‚Äôm waiting for a specialist referral or for nutrionalist. 

Also, what‚Äôs the deal with protein/carbs? If I have a kinda carb-y food with an equal amount of grams of protein, is that ‚Äúsafe?‚Äù Or will I just be eating salad and turkey slices the rest of my life? (Im terrified of spiking)

1ok2dis,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ok2dis/i_found_a_stack_of_polaroid_pictures_hidden_in_my/,I found a stack of Polaroid pictures hidden in my son‚Äôs Halloween candy. Someone‚Äôs been stalking us.,"Neither of us knew what was waiting for us inside Max's candy bucket.

We'd just brought it back home from trick-or-treating and unlocked the front door. The second I turned the knob, Max shot into the living room, holding his pumpkin-shaped candy bucket in both hands. He flipped it over, gave it a shake, and all his candy poured out onto the carpet. Then he tossed the bucket aside.

""Mommy, mommy!"" he screamed. ""Can I eat my candy now?""

I came in behind him, laughing, because only a five-year-old could get that pumped about eating candy. ""Thank you for asking-go ahead."" I sat beside him, criss-cross-applesauce, and watched.

Max worked through the pile by opening a piece, tasting it, then either scrunching up his face or giggling in approval, before moving on to the next. It was adorable. Seeing him like that made me smile. But as I kept watching, the moment began to sour.

See, I was a single mother. We lived off my income alone. And because I was just a waitress in a small cafe, money was tight. There were some days when I could only afford to feed Max, and not myself. Whenever he asked why I wasn't eating, I'd say I already ate at the restaurant, which was a lie, because even with my employee discount, those meals still cost money. My manager had even fired employees before for sneaking food without paying.

I lied because I didn't want Max to worry. I think kids shouldn't have to worry about those kinds of things. They should be having fun, like Max was doing now. But while I watched him eat his candy, and I saw the happiness he got from what only strangers could give him, something twisted up inside me. I felt like a failure as a mother.

Max noticed I wasn't eating any candy and piled several pieces in front of me. ""No, honey,"" I said, putting them back on his pile. ""These are all yours. Mommy doesn't want any.""

""Why not?""

""Because I‚Ä¶ don't want to take any from you.""

Once I said that, a flicker of sadness moved in his eyes. He looked up at me, almost like he was beginning to understand something about me. Like he'd had a realization, wise beyond his years. It broke my heart. ""Okay,"" I said. ""Just one. You choose.""

Max smiled. He hovered his little fingers over the pile, carefully weighing his options, and stalled over a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. He squeezed down and lifted. Underneath, the corner of something jabbed out.

It looked like a small stack of paper. It looked glossy, and even gleamed in the overhead light. Whatever it was, I could tell it wasn't candy. Did one of the neighbors put something in there by accident?

I reached down and pulled at the corner, and out slid a stack of Polaroid pictures. There were three of them, stuck together with a rubber band.

""What's this, Max?""

Max didn't say anything. He watched curiously as I snapped off the rubber band and flipped the stack over.

The first picture framed a residential home at night. An adult woman stood on the sidewalk with a hand on her hip, watching a much smaller person-most likely a child-approach the front door. The lighting was so dark, I couldn't tell who they were. But in the child's hand, I could see them gripping onto something. Like a pail, or a bucket. Right then, I got it. This was a parent watching her child go trick-or-treating. Yup, one of the neighbors must've put this in here by mistake. I wondered who it was.

I flipped to the next picture.

I actually recognized the subject in this one. It was my neighbor, Terry, standing at his opened front door. Someone who was hidden just beneath the frame held up a bucket, and Terry, smiling warmly like always, dropped a few pieces of candy in. Something about that bucket caught my eye. I studied it, noticing its circular shape, and realized it was designed to look like a pumpkin. My eyes drifted over to Max's pumpkin-shaped bucket on the carpet. My heart skipped a beat. But I didn't want to jump to any conclusions.

I flipped to the final picture.

It was a shot of an open window, taken from behind a bush. A few out-of-focus leaves dangled in the foreground. But in sharp focus, right in the center of the picture, was my son's smiling face. I was behind him, zipping up his costume, just before we went trick-or-treating. We were standing inside this very room.

""Max?"" I said, keeping my voice as calm as possible. ""Which house gave you these?""

Max scrunched up his forehead while he thought. He shrugged. Then he reached for another piece of candy.

I blocked his hand. ""Stop. Don't eat any more of that."" I stood. Glanced around. I was beginning to panic.

""How come?""

""Because I said so. Don't ask questions right now.""

Max began to cry. I ran to the front door to check the lock. It was already set.

Okay. I'd just taken my son trick-or-treating. Someone was following us. They took pictures of us, and then dropped those pictures inside his bucket. We only went around our neighborhood, so it had to be one of our neighbors who did it. Was this someone kind of sick joke? Or was one of them really stalking us? What do I do?

I looked past the living room, into the kitchen. My phone was on the island counter. I raced over to it and dialed 911.

It rang twice. Then the operator answered.

""911, what's your emergency?""

""Yes, yes, I-""

Max interrupted, tugging on my leg, crying for me to let him eat more candy. ""Honey. I will buy you more candy. But mommy is on the phone right-""

""911,"" the operator repeated. ""Please state your emergency.""

""Yes. We need help, please. I think someone is stalking me.""

The operator took down my name, address, and details about what happened. Ten minutes later, two officers were at my house. One shone a flashlight around my property while the other one, a young, tall officer, came to the door. He introduced himself as Officer Dan and asked for the photos.

""I'm Jenny. And this is all of them,"" I said, handing them over.

He took them with a gloved hand and scanned over the first one. While I waited, I felt Max stir behind me-he was hiding behind my legs, peeking up at the officer.

Officer Dan flipped to the second one, looked at it, then cleared his throat. ""Who's the man here?""

""That's my neighbor, Terry. But it couldn't be him. He's a good man.""

""I'm sure he is,"" he said.

He flipped to the final picture. He studied it, and as he drank in the details, the faint lines around his eyes sharpened. He looked down at Max, then up to me.

""So, what's going to happen now?"" I said. My voice sounded more desperate than I had intended.

""We're going to sweep the neighborhood. Even if we don't find anything, there'll be an officer nearby to patrol every hour. Also, we'll speak with Mr. Terry-not because he's a suspect, but just in case he's seen any suspicious activity. Also, I see that he has a Ring camera. We'll check the footage on that as well. Now, ma'am?""

He took a glance behind me. ""Is it just‚Ä¶you two in the house?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""Just us.""

""Is there somewhere else you can stay tonight? Maybe with friends or family?""

There wasn't. All my friends were my husband's, and once he left me, so did they. I started to answer, but was caught by surprise when tears welled in my eyes. Whether it was the stress of our situation, or just me being scared, I didn't know. I blinked them away before they could fall and shook my head.

""No. It's just us.""

He nodded. ""Well, there's a DoubleTree down the road. Wouldn't be a bad idea for you guys to book a room tonight.""

*Book a room? I don't even know how I'm going to feed Max tomorrow.*¬†""Officer, that's not really an option for us.""

Officer Dan gave me this look then. Honestly, it wasn't so different from the one Max sometimes gave me. With Max, I always thought it was a normal sadness that kids feel when they don't get their way. But with the officer, there was something deeper. I think he actually felt sorry for me. And I never wanted that. I never wanted that from anybody. I felt embarrassed.

""Look,"" he said, pulling a pencil and notepad from his shirt pocket. ""This is my personal number. Doesn't matter what time-if you need anything at all, give me a call. I'll be close.""

""Thank you, officer.""

""Just Dan,"" he said, placing a hand on my shoulder. Then he turned and left.

I closed the door and rested my forehead on it.

""Mommy?"" Max said. ""What's happening?""

I shut my eyes. ""It's alright, sweetie. Mommy's just trying to fix a problem. That's all.""

We both got quiet. A few seconds passed. ""Will we be okay?""

""I think so. Come on, let's go get ready for bed. Sleep in mommy's room tonight. I'll come tuck you in.""

""Okay,"" Max said. He ran up the stairs without a care in the world.

I put Officer Dan's number on speed dial. Then I checked every door and every window to make sure the house was totally locked down.

Half an hour later, I tucked Max into my bed, kissed him goodnight, and closed the door behind me. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Officer Dan.

He told me the neighborhood was ""clear,"" but they'd keep a ""close watch."" My heart sank. I had hoped they would've caught the bastard, and we could put this whole mess behind us. All the same, I thanked the officer and told him goodnight.

Sleep was out of the question. Instead, I'd fix a cup of coffee and sit up all night. And if I heard so much as a twig snap outside, I was calling the cops. I headed downstairs to start on the coffee. My chest tightened with anxiety.

He was still out there. I just knew it. Probably even close by. What if he was standing outside the house at that very moment? I caught myself biting on a fingernail and stopped. That was a bad habit I'd developed when I was a kid, but nowadays, it only flared up during moments of high stress.

I passed through the kitchen and opened the cabinet, fishing out both my¬†*Maxwell House*¬†coffee grounds and a filter. I loaded the filter, dumped in a few scoops, and hit brew. Then I stood there a moment, feeling myself wanting to cry again.¬†*Damn it, Jenny. Now is not the time to get emotional.*¬†*You're the adult, here. Hold it together-*

Something on the island countertop beside me shined in my periphery. I glanced over. Then I stared for a long time, in disbelief, trying to make absolutely certain that my eyes weren't deceiving me.

Sitting right there, on the countertop, was a fresh set of Polaroid pictures.

That was impossible. I'd given the officer everything I had. Was I losing my mind?

I reached out, almost scared to touch them, and gently picked them up. In the first picture, Max was hiding behind my legs while I spoke with Officer Dan. Only this shot wasn't taken through an open window, from outside the house. It was taken from behind us. From inside the house.

My mind struggled to process what I was seeing. There was no way an intruder could have entered the house and taken a picture with an officer standing right there.

I flipped to the next one.

This one was of me in my bedroom, tucking my son into bed. And the way it was shot looked like something only possible in a dream. It was captured from a bird's-eye view, directly above our heads. A blade from the ceiling fan even cut into the edge of the frame. Because it was taken so close to the light, the shot was overexposed, which put a hazy kind of filter over it. This defied all logic.

To get that picture, whoever or¬†*what*ever took it would have to have been suspended from the ceiling. They would have to have manipulated themselves into an impossible angle. All without me or Max knowing.

My hands were trembling now. The room was beginning to spin. Terrified now, I flipped to the final picture.

It was of me, my back facing the camera, standing in my kitchen. I was looking down. Studying something in my hands. Just like I was now, at this very moment. The shot was taken so close behind me, whatever had taken it could have reached out and touched me.

I needed to get Max out of the house. Right now.

*Click.*

Something snapped, directly behind my head. Then the room was quiet again. My mind took a moment to register what it even was. But slowly, a sick realization slithered up from the pit of my stomach.

What I had just heard was the shutter of a Polaroid camera.

The camera's inner mechanisms hummed as it worked to print out the picture. I froze. I stopped breathing. In a desperate attempt, I tried reasoning with the intruder.

""What do you want from me?"" I cried. I listened for a response, still holding the pictures in my trembling fingers. There was no reply.

The picture finished printing, and whatever was behind me stood perfectly still. Several seconds ticked by. Was it waiting for¬†*me*¬†to turn around?

Across the counter, against the back wall was a block of kitchen knives. I wished they were closer. But they were way out of reach. Depending on what happened next, maybe I could get to them. But for now, I would have to turn and face whatever was behind me, head on.

One slow inch at a time, I turned my head, my heart pounding inside my chest. I expected to be stabbed or choked or grabbed at any second. I turned a little bit further, then shot a glance back.

The kitchen was empty.

I exhaled-but a new fear, much greater than before, exploded inside me.¬†*It's going to get Max.*

I dropped the pictures and shot around the counter and ripped out the biggest knife from the block. Then I dug out my phone and hit ""call"" on Officer Dan's contact.

*Call failed.*

I tapped the screen several more times.

*Call failed. Call failed. Call failed.*¬†I slammed it on the counter in a fit of anger. Of all the times for my phone to not work, of course it would be now. I had no other option. I'd have to run upstairs and get Max by myself.

I moved through the downstairs with the knife aimed in front of me. I checked around every corner and every piece of furniture I passed. I sprinted up the stairs, then through the upstairs hallway, toward my bedroom.

I pushed the bedroom door open slowly, horrified that it had already beaten me there. Thankfully, Max was still under the covers, safe and sound. I peeled the blanket off him and scooped him up in my arms.

""Mommy?"" he said, rubbing his eyes.

""Shhh. We have to go. Stay quiet."" He wrapped his arms around me and put his head on my shoulder.

I crept over to the door and peeked into the hallway. Empty.

I carried Max down the hall, toward the stairs. If we could just make it out the front door, I'd run straight to the neighbors and call the cops from there. Just a short trip down the stairs and through the living room. We could do it.

When we neared the steps, I heard the worst noise imaginable. Footsteps pounding up the stairs.

My mind entered into fight or flight mode. Should I attack? Give Max a chance to run? No-I can't leave him. He'd never get away.

I backed up. To my right was my son's bedroom. I ducked inside and rushed to the closet. I inched open the door as quietly as I could, but still, it squealed on its hinges. We slid inside. There was barely enough space for both of us. I clicked the door shut and stood in front of Max, using my body as a shield.

""Mommy, what are we doing?""

I turned and cupped a hand over his mouth. ""Not. Another. Word.""

We listened. With each passing second, the footsteps grew closer, until they arrived at the bedroom door. Then they slowed to a nice and easy stroll and entered the room. Floorboards creaked under a shifting weight. Something paced across the room, from left to right, like it was searching for us. Once it reached the right wall, it stopped. Then turned. And moved toward the closet.

I tightened my grip on the knife. A stream of adrenaline coursed through my veins, making my skin tingle. I fought hard to keep my mind clear and focused. If the door opened, I would take them by surprise. Hammer the blade down in one, quick motion. It was all I had.

It came right up to the door. And stopped. The sound of our own breathing filled the closet. A floorboard creaked.

Every nerve inside my body screamed.¬†*What is it doing? Why is it just standing there?*¬†Then, a camera clicked. Through the gap under the door, a light flashed. Against all logic, all reason, it had taken a picture of the closet door.

A deep, yet childlike laughter vibrated into the closet. The camera clicked again. It knew exactly where we were, and it was playing games. It was toying with us. Max's body trembled behind me, and a soft whimper escaped from his lips.

I prepared myself. The door would open any moment. And it was up to me to save our lives.

I raised the knife so I could swing it down right as the door opened. I held my breath. I listened as the handle jiggled and began to turn. The door swung open.

I hacked the knife blindly in front of me. Officer Dan staggered backwards just in time.

""Whoa! Whoa!""

I darted my eyes around the room. Looking for it. Looking for blood. I was frantic.

""It's just me! It's just me. No one is here. I've got you. You're safe.""

""No we're not. It was just here. I heard-""

""We have multiple officers searching your home. No one is here.""

I scanned the room again. There was no camera. No creature. No obvious threat. The stress of what had just occurred began weighing down on me. I lost my sense of balance and stumbled. Officer Dan caught me by the arm. He guided me toward Max's bed. As I sat down, Max darted out from the closet and jumped onto the bed and clung onto me.

""You called me. Remember?"" Officer Dan said. ""But you didn't say anything, so we were afraid something had happened. We forced open the front door, then I heard you guys in here. Did you think he broke in?""

""I know he did. There were footsteps. And there's more pictures. Just look on the counter-""

""There are no signs of forced entry, Jenny."" Officer Dan paused and glanced over at the closet door. He ran his palms together, then approached the bed. He took a seat beside us. ""You know, sometimes, in high stress situations, our minds produce things-sounds, images, things like that-that aren't really there. It's¬†*perfectly*¬†normal. Given your‚Ä¶situation, it's possible that that's all that happened.""

""Don't talk to me like that, Dan. Don't talk to me like I'm crazy. I know what I saw, I know what I heard. You're a cop, not a therapist. Get off the bed.""

Once I'd snapped on him, Officer Dan had no more psychotherapeutic explanations for me. He stood and left us alone in the room. He left the house, in fact, but some of the other officers were kind enough to stay with us until morning. For the rest of the night, there were no more signs of the intruder.

\*\*\*

The next day, I applied for a credit card and checked us into a hotel. I also put that house on the market. A week later, someone bought it. I took the money and bought a new house in a completely different state. Even though the old one sold well under its value, I didn't care. As long as we left behind whatever was in there, we had all we needed.

At Max's new school, I met a group of moms that I became friends with, and that made a huge improvement on my quality of life. For the first time in a long time, I had people who cared about me. These ladies checked up on me. Came over for wine night. Got me out of my house. They even introduced me to a great guy who I'm still dating.

Max made some new friends of his own, and he seemed happy at his new school. For a while, things were pretty great.

This morning, I put a note in Max's lunch box, telling him how much I loved him. I know that is incredibly lame, but I couldn't help myself. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I always want him to know that.

When he got home from school, he threw his lunchbox on the counter, ran up to me, and kissed me on the cheek. ""I love you too, mommy,"" he said. Then he went into his room to do his homework.

My heart filled with joy. I was floating as I started to clean out his lunch box. Then, for the first time in a long time, I actually cried. I cried because, at that moment, I loved my life. I wished things would stay like that forever.

I took the icepack out of the lunchbox, then turned it upside down over the trashcan. A few plastic baggies dropped into the trash, and then a piece of paper fluttered out-paper made of a different material than the one I'd written the note on. This one was glossy, small, and square.

It was a Polaroid.

Violent images flooded my mind. The flash under the door. The camera click. Demonic laughter. I leaned against the wall. I was having trouble breathing.

*Calm down,*¬†I told myself.¬†*Calm down, breathe. That's it.*¬†*Maybe it was just something Max was working on in class.*

I fished the picture out of the trash.

It was taken inside a classroom. Kids sat at their desks, talking amongst themselves. It was all normal enough, but then I noticed the angle at which the photo was taken. It was taken from the back of the classroom, shooting down at the kids' heads. Almost like it was taken from the ceiling. Centered in the picture, held in sharp focus, was Max's smiling face. He was captured, mid-laugh.

I screamed and dropped the picture. It spiraled to the ground and landed face down. There was a note scribbled on the back.

Now, I don't know what to do. I thought it was the house. I thought that if we moved, we would leave that thing behind. But now I know it was all in vain. Because it followed us.

On the back, written in dark red ink, were the words, ""I love you too, Jenny.""",12,1761837180.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1ok2be3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ok2be3/advice_for_anyone_that_smoked_weed_and_spiraled/,Advice for anyone that smoked weed and spiraled out of control,"Very long post

Hey all, so by nature I suffer from anxiety and unhealthy amounts of intrusive thoughts (so bad that I can NOT watch gore movies because it makes me think what if that happens to my loved ones and my mind begins to visualize it happening and it upsets me so so bad). I know weed and anxiety aren‚Äôt the ideal combination but I could do it without losing control. 

ANYWAY Ive smoked weed for a couple of years, all day everyday that my tolerance skyrocketed. I recently stopped smoking for a long time due to personal life reasons and last night I decided to give it a go again. I smoked a blunt that was equal parts THC and CBD and because I had such a high tolerance before, I figured half a gram would be good. It wasn‚Äôt. It was WAY too much after being off of it for a year. 
Within 10 minutes I realized this was an amount that was gonna green me out and it did. 

EXPERIENCE:

I took off my Apple Watch because I knew my heart was absolutely racing and I didn‚Äôt wanna get an alert that could spiral me even more. 

I had allllll the horrible symptoms. Uncontrollable shivers, multiple layers of consciousness that felt like I was going in and out from, thoughts like I fucked up, what if I go into psychosis? what if this is permanent? What if I ruined my life? And I was laying in bed thinking do I need to go to the hospital? Am I gonna pass out? Closing my eyes but feeling like they‚Äôre still open..etc

But I‚Äôve been there before so I knew what I had to do. If you‚Äôve never greened out or if it‚Äôs your first time doing weed, I know how this can easily make someone absolutely lose their shit. 

SO IM HERE TO TELL YOU, IT DOES GET BETTER. This is not permanent.  

  I KNEW from experience that my highs use to last from 1-2 hours before I felt completely sober and I knew this could last a little longer since I haven‚Äôt smoked in a year. So I focused on the time. I smoked at 10:30 pm so by 12:30 the high WILL start to lessen and focusing on the time and knowing that helped me keep myself grounded. 
  I KNEW that the extreme shivers and being cold was normal because it used to happen to me every time when I first started out, so I tried my best to keep myself warm because if I was warm I wasn‚Äôt shivering and keeping my shivers in control helped me worry about one less thing. 
  I KNEW from experience that keeping myself moving helped me keep my mind in current reality (like moving my legs)  and even if it lasted for a few seconds before my consciousness shifted again, I would force myself to think ok the more I experience reality, the closer I‚Äôll slowly get to being stable even if it only lasts a few moments at a time. And during the moments my consciousness shifted, I would tell myself to wait for the moment reality comes back and that helped tremendously. 
  DO NOT try to sleep because it will make it worse. I got extremely tired and that didn‚Äôt help because every time I dozed off, my thoughts amplified to the point I couldn‚Äôt tell if my eyes were open or closed and that made the different levels of consciousness even harder to differentiate. So I forced myself to watch videos that were around 20 mins because I knew with each 20 minutes that passed, I would slowly start to sober up. 
  AFTER EVERY VIDEO I would type something on my phone, whether it was on google or note pad and I knew that once I got to the point where I could spell correctly and form a proper sentence, I was starting to sober up and things were getting less intense. Which would make me realize that the moments I was in my current reality were getting longer and more frequent which assured me that this horrible experience was coming to an end and that thought alone gave me huge comfort. 

After the 2 hour mark I no longer felt like I was losing my mind and at 1:30 am I was stable enough to fall asleep without my thoughts being amplified and it was honestly the best sleep I‚Äôve gotten in a long time. I normally have very vivid upsetting dreams and this time it was complete quiet. 
When I got up this morning around 7:30 the high was completely gone, my mind was still intact, and all I felt was a little grogginess that a cup of coffee completely fixed. 

LASTLY, this experience was truly god awful but because I knew what it was gonna be like, I just tried to ride it out and NOT fight against it. The more you fight to get sober, the worse it‚Äôll be. Weed can be a powerful mind altering drug but the human mind is more resilient than we give it credit for. Try your hardest to keep your thoughts to one thing at a time and KNOW that this experience is only temporary because it really is and you can keep your sanity. 

Sorry for the long post, this is just what has worked for me the few times I‚Äôve greened out.

I'm more comfortable in my skin than ever before and i know what i like and what i dont like. I'm straight up honest and will say what's on my mind but at the same time, im empathic (sometimes it's a curse, and yes it's contradictory) and wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm prone to over thinking and sometimes worry about the little things in life, because the little things are actually really important. 

**Things that i like:**  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My strengths, in no particular order..**   
*Non ghoster:*  
I'd much rather talk things through, than to just up and leave.  
*Overthinking:*  
Nobody has managed to steal my kidneys yet.  
*Quietly confident:*  
I'm not the loudest person in the room but i will speak up when need to. 

**My weaknesses..**  
*Take things to heart:*  
Yeah, maybe i can be a little sensitive.  
*Ticklish:*  
Please don't make me squeal like a girl.

**How i live dangerously..**  
*I dont use screen protectors or even a case for my phone.*

1ok26rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/allwearcom/comments/1ok26rv/planning_for_the_holidays_simplify_the_season/,Planning for the Holidays: Simplify the Season with Allwear,"# The Calm Before the Festivities

As the holidays draw near, life tends to speed up ‚Äî work deadlines, travel plans, gatherings, last-minute shopping. Amid all the noise, there‚Äôs something deeply grounding about simplifying the season and focusing on what really matters: being present, comfortable, and at ease.

This year, skip the stress and start with the essentials. At Allwear, we believe that what you wear should support your pace ‚Äî not complicate it. From effortless layering pieces to breathable travel staples, our collections are designed to help you move through the holidays with ease and quiet confidence.

# Step One: Streamline Your Wardrobe

Between holiday dinners and weekend getaways, it‚Äôs easy to overpack or overthink what to wear. The key is to plan with purpose. Choose versatile pieces that mix and match effortlessly ‚Äî fabrics that travel well, colors that pair with everything, and silhouettes that feel right no matter where you are.

Start with the **Allwear Organic Shirt Jacket** ‚Äî the perfect in-between layer for shifting temperatures. It‚Äôs structured enough for dinners and gatherings, yet soft and relaxed for casual days. Paired with the **Allwear Organic Sweat Shorts** for warm-weather escapes or the timeless **Allwear Organic Trouser** for cooler climates, you‚Äôll be covered for both comfort and style.

And if your holiday plans include long flights or road trips, the **Allwear Bamboo 6‚Äù Compression Shorts** offer subtle support and stretch that move with you, keeping you comfortable from boarding to arrival.

# Step Two: Dress with Intention

The holidays often mean shifting from one setting to another ‚Äî a quick coffee run, a long lunch, an evening celebration. Choosing adaptable pieces saves you from outfit changes and wardrobe clutter.

The **Allwear Bamboo Mandarin Polo** offers just that balance ‚Äî refined enough for gatherings yet breathable and soft for relaxed wear. Its minimalist design makes it easy to layer under a jacket or wear on its own, taking you from day to night with quiet sophistication.

For those who prefer sleek simplicity, the **Allwear Bamboo Bodysuit** becomes the perfect foundation. It creates a clean, seamless silhouette whether paired with trousers or a skirt, and layers effortlessly beneath jackets. Add a touch of movement with the **Allwear Organic Hoodie**, and you‚Äôve got a combination that works anywhere ‚Äî cozy without losing its edge.

# Step Three: Embrace Comfort That Lasts

Amid the rush, comfort often takes a back seat ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt have to. Every Allwear piece is designed for longevity, both in feel and form. Our **Allwear Bamboo Leggings**, for example, are crafted for softness that doesn‚Äôt fade, while the **Allwear Organic Joggers** remain a staple for home days and casual outings alike.

Even the small details matter. The **Allwear Bamboo Thong** and **Finishing Touch** **Allwear Organic Socks** are made with sustainable fibers that stay breathable and gentle against the skin ‚Äî perfect for long days spent on your feet or festive nights that run late.

It‚Äôs the kind of comfort that allows you to stay fully present ‚Äî to enjoy, to move, to celebrate.

# Step Four: Pack Light, Live Fully

As you plan your holidays ‚Äî the trips, the reunions, the quiet mornings ‚Äî remember that simplicity leaves space for joy. Fewer, better things. Pieces that can do more with less.

Allwear was built on that idea. Our essentials are made to last beyond seasons and trends, designed for people who move through life with intention. Whether you‚Äôre celebrating at home or exploring somewhere new, these are clothes that adapt ‚Äî not distract.

This holiday season, make comfort your foundation and sustainability your standard. Let your wardrobe work as hard as you do, quietly supporting every moment worth remembering.

Because the best part of the holidays isn‚Äôt what you wear ‚Äî it‚Äôs how free you feel in it.

**Discover the** **Allwear collections** ‚Äî thoughtful essentials for wherever the season takes you.

1ok230t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1ok230t/how_to_speak_like_you_read_500_books_a_year/,How to speak like you read 500 books a year: wildly simple tricks that make you sound SMART,"It‚Äôs wild how many of us feel totally fine texting, writing, even tweeting, but still freeze up or ramble when we actually have to speak out loud. Whether it‚Äôs in meetings, with friends, or just ordering coffee, that feeling of your brain moving faster than your mouth, or worse, your mouth moving faster than your brain, is way more common than people admit. And it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúyou‚Äù problem. It‚Äôs cultural, neurological, and totally fixable.

This post is for anyone who‚Äôs sick of hearing themselves say ‚Äúuhhh‚Ä¶‚Äù every five seconds, or spiral into incoherent tangents when they could‚Äôve just said one clear thing. I‚Äôve pulled the best insights from psychology, neuroscience, coaching, and communication science, stuff you won‚Äôt find in the overstimulated hot takes of ""alpha"" podcasters or LinkedIn hustle bros. Speaking well isn‚Äôt about sounding fancy. It‚Äôs about saying what you mean and meaning what you say.

If you‚Äôve ever walked away from a conversation thinking ‚ÄúWhy did I say THAT?‚Äù read this.

One of the most mind-blowing things I‚Äôve learned from **Dr. Ethan Kross**, a psychologist at the University of Michigan who studies self-talk, is this: people who practice speaking to themselves in the third person, like ‚ÄúWhat should Alex do here?‚Äù, actually speak more clearly and with more calm. His book *Chatter* breaks this down. Using ""psychological distance"" boosts verbal clarity and reduces anxiety. Your thoughts get cleaner. You stop spiraling mid-sentence. Not saying you have to sound like a cartoon villain, but lowkey, talking to yourself like you‚Äôre coaching a friend makes you pause, reflect, and then speak.

Another underrated trick is something from Chris Voss, former FBI negotiator, in his book *Never Split the Difference*. He teaches the ‚Äúmirroring‚Äù technique, which basically means repeating the last few words someone said to you in a curious tone. This buys you time to think, keeps the other person engaged, and makes you sound measured, even when you‚Äôre winging it. It also builds connection. People love feeling heard, and good speakers are just elite listeners who respond slowly.

Verbal fluency isn‚Äôt about having a big vocabulary. It‚Äôs about reducing friction. If you want to be more articulate, the golden rule is **slow down your rate of speech**. Studies from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology show that slower speakers are perceived as more intelligent and trustworthy, even when they say the exact same stuff. The mistake most people make is trying to speak fast to sound smart. But your brain needs time to choose cleaner words. Fast talkers often self-correct mid-sentence, lose their point, or undersell strong ideas.

To make this easier on yourself, reduce the mental clutter. One way to do this is to literally script your thoughts. Not everything, obviously. But scripting 3-4 sentences before a meeting or social moment helps your brain get USED to forming coherent structures. That‚Äôs what good speaking is: clean mental structure. Think in concepts, not sentences. Then let your words follow.

If you want a book that will completely rewire how you think about communication, grab **‚ÄúThank You for Arguing‚Äù by Jay Heinrichs**. It‚Äôs a NYT bestseller and used in Ivy League rhetoric courses. Heinrichs was a speechwriter and persuader for major political campaigns, and this book is hands down *the best book on how to speak persuasively without being manipulative*. It unpacks ancient rhetorical tricks in modern language. After reading it, I stopped overexplaining and started making sharper points with fewer words. Lowkey changed how people respond to me.

Another banger is **‚ÄúThe Art of Thinking Clearly‚Äù by Rolf Dobelli**. This isn‚Äôt a communication book per se, but it helps you strip away thought errors like confirmation bias, sunk cost fallacy, or overconfidence, that make your arguments weird and your conversations messy. Dobelli used to be a Swiss banker turned novelist turned behavioral science nerd. His writing is addictive. Short chapters, clean logic, super snackable. This book will make your thinking sharper which automatically makes your speech cleaner.

To actually practice speaking, you need feedback. Not from your friends, they‚Äôre too nice. Not from your boss, they‚Äôre too busy. From actual tools. One app I‚Äôve been testing lately is **BeFreed**, an AI-powered learning app created by a Columbia University team. It curates personalized learning plans using books, expert talks, and case studies, and turns them into podcast-style learning sessions tailored to your goals. I picked communication and articulation as my focus, and it built me a listening roadmap, 10, 20, or 40 minutes per session, based on how deep I want to go. You can even pick the voice style of your host, which makes it weirdly fun. The best part? It adapts weekly based on what I‚Äôve listened to, and even tracks how much I‚Äôm improving. It also has every book I mentioned above in its library.

For passive immersion, I‚Äôve also been zoning out to the **‚ÄúSpeak Like a CEO‚Äù podcast**, which breaks down how top communicators, from startup founders to diplomats, craft their words. It‚Äôs like free coaching. Episodes are full of verbal exercises, phrasing upgrades, and body language cues. The hosts are chill, not cringey, and the examples are practical.

Another app I‚Äôm obsessed with is **Fable**, especially their book clubs on self-expression and public speaking. Real people discuss ideas. You hear how others phrase their thoughts and how they navigate disagreement. It‚Äôs a great way to normalize thoughtful speech without pressure. Plus, reading with others naturally expands your verbal range. You start noticing tone, rhythm, sentence length, all the things that make someone sound intentional instead of chaotic.

If you‚Äôre into YouTube, check out **Julian Treasure‚Äôs TEDx talks**. Especially ‚ÄúHow to Speak so People Want to Listen‚Äù. His breakdown of vocal tone, register, pace, and intention is basically a masterclass in under 10 minutes. He‚Äôs a sound expert who‚Äôs coached execs and broadcasters, and the tips are simple enough to use immediately. Like: how lowering your voice slightly at the end of your sentence signals confidence, or how silence can be a power move.

Speaking well isn‚Äôt about being born charismatic. It‚Äôs a skill. Like writing. Or lifting. Or drawing. The more you build it, the more it builds YOU. Sounding clear means thinking clearly. And thinking clearly makes you feel in control, even when your voice shakes. Especially when your voice shakes.",1,1761836506.0,BetterAtPeople,0,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

We had this nanny for 2 years and her issues progressed over time to the level where I think we can‚Äôt tolerate it anymore. My family believes we are overreacting 

1) always late by 5 minutes and then it takes an additional 5-10 minutes for her to set up for the day (put her stuff in the fridge, make herself a cup of coffee etc). I have addressed the tardiness twice, she tries for a day or two and then reverts back to her normal self. States the drive is too long (~20 mins)
2)when she is ready to leave, she just puts the kid in a safe place (like her pack and play), dresses up an leaves. To clarify, there has never been an instance where she had to leave late (yup, never even once in the past 2 years, I always make sure to be home so she can leave).
3)she is very resistant to getting out of the house, even to the backyard. States she is afraid of bugs and bug bites. 
4)she is very resistant to any changes including wants to feed my 4 year old literally the same meal every day. To clarify, she does not cook a full meal - it is just cutting up some fruits/veggies/making a toast or boiling an egg.
5)only follows written instructions
6)keeps requesting to leave 30 mins extra for her volunteering activities (to be fair, this happens once every 2-3 months or so)
7)she just wants to sit and let them play. I have written a plan for her to follow (like reading for 15 mins, spelling for 15 mins etc), otherwise she‚Äôd just sit and stare at the wall for hours just making sure they don‚Äôt hurt themselves. I have to be very involved in everything. 

To clarify, we‚Äôre paying her $25 an hour, and her responsibilities are limited to childcare. She doesn‚Äôt assist with washing bottles or laundry. She has all the benefits, including PTO holidays, and sick days.

1ok1x1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1ok1x1w/my_future_mil_temporarily_moved_in_with_my_fianc√©/,"My (future) MIL temporarily moved in with my fianc√©. Fianc√© has now decided that it‚Äôs permanent, and I am seeing escalating signs of possible enmeshment- can I snap her out of it???","My main questions for the below: are these signs of enmeshment, and if so, how the hell can I convince her that she has an unhealthy lack of boundaries with MIL?

My fianc√© (we‚Äôre both aged 34) have been together for almost 4 years. We‚Äôre long distance (2.5 hour drive one way) meaning that the only time I can see her is on the weekends.  And my fianc√© has an unreliable car, so I do all the driving every weekend to come see her. This wasn‚Äôt a problem until nearly 2 years ago when her mother moved in with her because she left her abusive husband (my fianc√©‚Äôs step father.)  To be clear I strongly supported MIL staying with my fianc√© and leaving her ex. She and my fianc√© have definitely been mentally abused by this man for years. And I don‚Äôt think MIL is being *intentionally* manipulative or disruptive in any way, but I do see signs that they have an increasingly unhealthy dynamic. And I‚Äôm noticing that my fianc√©‚Äôs lack of firm boundaries towards MIL has begun to deeply affect fianc√© and I‚Äôs relationship.

MIL moving in with fianc√© was supposed to be a temporary situation, and MIL and I got along really well for about a year or so, but more recently, MIL and my fianc√© have decided that they want to live together permanently. Now this directly goes against what my fianc√© and I had been planning previously for our future. Fianc√© has suddenly started to demand that MIL be included in our future plans to live together,  any questions I had about it have been met with extreme defensiveness from my fianc√©. It‚Äôs totally up ended our previously calm relationship. Up to just a few months ago, my fianc√© and I were able to communicate about all issues in a remarkably healthy way. But now, even asking my fianc√©  about what our future living situation would look like with her mom makes my fianc√© extremely defensive. 

Worse yet, MIL has been continuously invading our/ my personal space, possibly subtly guilt tripping my fianc√©, and refusing to respect boundaries of our relationship. I spoke with my therapist, and she said she was getting a sense that fianc√© and MIL were mildly enmeshed. 

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen:


* MIL consistently invades our/ my privacy when I‚Äôm there and fianc√© did set some basic boundaries for our relationship, but fianc√© makes it seem like these boundaries are hurting MIL and that I should be extremely grateful. 

Examples of these basic boundaries: asking MIL to knock before coming into fianc√©s bedroom when I‚Äôm there, asking MIL to not use my products (labeled with my name) in the bathroom, asking her to park in a way which allows my car to fit too , asking her to avoid coming into my fianc√©‚Äôs room to tidy up while I‚Äôm there so we can have alone time, asking her to ask before throwing away my food that I place in the kitchen, asking her not to wash my laundry. 

*Fianc√© and I haven‚Äôt had sex in the last year due to the lack of privacy and MIL always being home. but if I bring this up, fianc√© gets deeply defensive of MIL. i recently suggested that we pay for MIL to have a nice night out or a massage to help her relax and also give my fianc√© and I much needed alone time for our anniversary and fianc√© was so offended by this suggestion that she hung up the phone. MIL has no friends, no community, no hobbies. She works part time as a grocery store clerk and then comes home to sit at the kitchen table to watch tik tok. meaning that she‚Äôs almost always feet away from my fianc√©s bedroom. 

*She always takes MILs side. 

Example- There‚Äôs been a couple of times when MIL threw away my non refrigerated food that I have placed on the counter. There‚Äôs no other place to put non refrigerated food in her kitchen. My Fianc√© said I should label all food that I don‚Äôt want thrown away with a note and marker stating ‚Äúdo not toss‚Äù. Essentially she blamed me instead of asking MIL to just simply not throw away my stuff or ask first. MIL has thrown out nearly full packs of cookies, chips, beef jerky, several times over the last few months. Also, I took a 30 min work call once in the midst of eating a sandwich and when I came back, MIL had thrown the 3/4 sandwich away. I have asked MIL if she felt like I was cluttering up the counter/ table and if that was the issue, but it was not. I‚Äôm a really tidy person. 

Also, MIL will wear shorts around the house and then constantly turns off the AC even if fianc√© and I are sweating. Instead of asking MIL to put on long pants or a sweater, fianc√© scolds me for saying I‚Äôm uncomfortable. The temp is sometimes 74¬∞F+. And I get that I don‚Äôt live there, but it‚Äôs odd that my girlfriend will be uncomfortable too but will get mad if I suggest asking her mom to stop messing with the AC.  Also, my fianc√© has a Siberian husky who is obviously uncomfortable if the temp is higher than 70¬∞F. Even if my fianc√© does tell her constantly to stop messing with the AC, MIL does constantly. She acts like she forgets day after day. 

*She constantly chooses MIL over me/our relationship. 

Recently fianc√© has decided that MIL will live with her permanently and will move in with us when we live together in the future. As I mentioned, this directly negates our previous future plans of living together. She has never asked me what I thought about it, and when I ask her for clarification about what that living situation would look like she gets extremely defensive. She has stated several times that it‚Äôs not up for discussion. (And no, her mom does not have medical needs that would require care.) We had been planning for most of our relationship to move to a specific city and state, and this now also has to be approved by MIL as well because my fianc√© is absolutely refusing to even think about having MIL live separately. 

*fianc√© has an incredibly strong urge to protect MIL. Anytime I comment about the lack of privacy we have fianc√© gets defensive and blatantly states that I‚Äôm ‚Äúthe problem‚Äù for being uncomfortable. She acts like any conflict or boundary setting at all will shatter her mom.  Any suggestion I have to increase our privacy and to get us to connect more emotionally/physically will result in fianc√© scoffing and rolling her eyes because she takes it as an attack against MIL. I suggested we start going on Saturday morning walks with coffee and she stated that this would take away from the time she spent with her mom on Saturday mornings. Which is essentially just them scrolling their phone side by side. 

*Despite my fianc√© and I having very limited time together, fianc√© often feels the need to include her mom in our plans. Fianc√© also feels anxious/ guilty leaving MIL alone if we were to take a night/ weekend trip, so we can no longer do that. 

*Her mom does ALL of my fianc√©s household chores as if she‚Äôs a child. She regularly comes into my fianc√©s room to collect her dirty laundry and vacuum or otherwise ‚Äúclean up.‚Äù We just FINALLY got her to start knocking after what seemed like months of her barging in. Except now she‚Äôs knocking at least once every couple of hours  to ‚Äútidy up‚Äù or ask us our plans for the evening. Which seems highly inappropriate to me considering that my fianc√© and I have such limited alone time already. 

*Her mom making occasional weird comments: 

- Because my fianc√© and I can‚Äôt really go anywhere, i recently took a week off and stayed with my fianc√©  for our anniversary, and MIL said she would ‚Äúmiss their evenings together‚Äù for that week. Seemed innocent at first but it made my fianc√© feel guilty.  

- When I asked my fianc√© to borrow an oversized flannel, MIL made a comment that she wanted to borrow one of her flannels too. Again, it seemed innocent, but it stuck in my brain as bizarre because they typically don‚Äôt wear each others clothes. It felt like MIL was responding to my request to borrow a flannel in a weirdly jealous way. 

-she‚Äôs made comments about random things, like my clothes. I once excitedly showed her my outfit for a wedding and she said ‚Äúyou like your pants like that huh?‚Äù They were perfectly normal trousers, except they were coral to match the wedding colors. 

- I asked my fianc√© if she wanted to get tickets for a very limited showing of a play that is really important to me and that she has been wanting to see, and she excitedly agreed. Weeks later and days before the play, either MIL or Fianc√© became aware of something MIL wanted to do the day before the play. Fianc√© had limited PTO, and so MIL asked her questions to determine if she *really* wanted to go to the play with me, or if she‚Äôd rather go to the thing MIL was interested in. MIL asked her ‚Äúhow much she really liked the play‚Äù to get her to determine what she wanted to do, despite already committing to plans with me and me being excited about them for weeks. Fianc√© ended up doing both and was exhausted and grumpy at the play from the night before with MIL. This did piss me off at first because it felt like a weird guilt trip thing to get my fianc√© to cancel plans with me so that they could make plans instead. 


So many things that I‚Äôve put off are coming to the light. These are just skimming the surface. The thing is, I deeply love my fianc√©. She‚Äôs typically such a special and uniquely kind and selfless person. We match perfectly on all of the most important values of mine.  But this issue has affected us recently in a way that I could have never predicted. 

Is there any thing I can say to get her to see past her blinders?? She‚Äôs convinced that her mom is a fragile angel who needs parented, and that I‚Äôm the problem for requesting basic personal space. I have told her so many times that I want to help support her mom too, but i can‚Äôt be in the relationship with their current lack of boundaries and personal space.

Officially 7 days smoke free,"I have been vaping for 6 years, and this is my first time quitting. Recently, my brother quit the habit after 10 years of smoking cold turkey. I tried for the first few days to do it, but withdrawal was so bad I was physically ill. Chills, migraines, couldn't even get out of bed, so I hit my vape to get rid of the headaches. Considering I still had to be a functioning adult and go to work, have meetings, and interact with people I couldn't necessarily be angry towards, I decided to start with the patches. 

And to be honest, they have been amazing! The first 3-4 days I had almost NO cravings. Like, I didn't even think about my vape at all. However, as the days have gone and I'm officially at the one week mark, cravings are bad... like really bad.

I find myself so frustrated that I can't just hit my vape. That it's not where I usually leave it at work on my desk. That it's not something I can do while I enjoy my coffee after dinner. I makes me physically emotional. And while the painful withdrawal symptoms aren't there anymore, how do y'all deal with the emotional ones? I am currently living alone for a week while my partner is out of town for work, and so I don't have a person to distract me throughout the day. Any advice for how to get over this extreme frustration and anger would be great. I'm not usually an emotional person, so these feelings are STRONG compared to what I am use to and it's killing me.

1ok1p3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1ok1p3f/i_got_my_telework_back_and_you_can_too/,"I got my telework back, and you can too","There is a way to get your telework (TW) back. I'm here to share how applying for a reasonable accommodation for Religious Purposes got telework back for myself, others in my office, and other FEDs who have reached out to me. Since I got mine approved back in July, I've been sharing my experience to help others in hopes of getting them their telework back. Let me share with you how I went about it and how hopefully you can too. 

***TL;DR:*** OPM‚Äôs July 16 memo and the DOJ‚Äôs Sept 18 memo both support **telework as a religious accommodation.** It‚Äôs legal, low-cost, and hard to deny. Request 1‚Äì3 days as situational TW, cite the memos, and you‚Äôll likely get approved.



Why am I doing this? Two reasons: 

1) to help my fellow FED friends and family

2) if this administration wants to weaponize religion and use it for hate, I say fuck em. 

If they want to offer such a lenient policy as to what constitutes justification for a RA for ‚Äúreligious telework‚Äù then I think everyone should apply for it. Religious or not. 



**Background:** 

On January 20th, the President released his [Return to Office Memo ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/return-to-in-person-work/)which took away remote work and a lot of people's ability to telework. I know some agencies have brought TW back since then,  but a majority have not. According to [OPMs TW ](https://www.opm.gov/telework/)page online, anything inconsistent with that memo or what [their memorandum](https://www.opm.gov/media/q0tbu2eq/guidance-on-presidential-memorandum-return-to-in-person-work.pdf) says is rescinded (granted their link to their own memo is a dead link). 



Then on July 16th, OPM dropped this: [Reasonable Accommodations for Religious Purposes](https://www.opm.gov/chcoc/latest-memos/reasonable-accommodations-for-religious-purposes.pdf). The 3rd page is what caught my attention: 

""agencies are strongly encouraged, where feasible, to consider telework as a reasonable accommodation for **religious practices, such as Sabbath or holiday observance, scheduled prayers, services, meditation, fasting, or other religious obligations.**"" 

It then goes on to list some other examples in greater detail like Sabbath/Holiday Observance and Preparation, Fasting, and Prayer/Religious Observances. 



**Light Bulb Moment**

I thought to myself, ""Surely an administration hell bent on removing telework and remote work wouldn't make it this easy to get TW back, would they?"" But in the next sentence they say: ""**Telework is often a low-cost solution that aligns with the Groff standard, as on a limited basis, it typically does not impose substantial operational burdens.**"" 



Now, before I start I just wanna say that I've seen all the jokes everyone made when this came out in July, and laughed at them. I've seen all the naysayers saying it won't work and it's not possible. I even toyed with some of the ideas and mention them a little further down. So I thought, ""Screw it, what do I have to lose? Worst case I get told no."" So now, time for some malicious compliance, or ethical gray area interpretation of it all. The way I see it, if I skip out on breakfast or giving up coffee for a few weeks, that's technically fasting. If I say a little prayer before my meals, well that's a scheduled prayer. If I'm sitting at my desk, spacing out, lost in my thoughts, some would say that technically meets the definition of meditating. If I'm putting up Christmas Decorations, technically that is Preparation for a Religious Holiday Observance (and I have a lot of decorations). I hope by now, you're picking up what I'm putting down. If not, I'll spell it out for you:

**THERE'S A LOT OF LEEWAY HERE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RELIGIOUS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LENIENCY OF THE MEMO**.

I even thought about what religions have the most religious observance days:

\- Pastafarians: have 1 every day, but unfortunately aren't legally recognized by the US govt \*\*sadly removes collander from head\*\*

\- Mort Orthodox sects

\- Christianity and Catholicism: lent, several weeks of fasting (abstaining from certain foods or drinks)



The memo even says for agencies to engage in good faith and that ""Denials of telework accommodations for religious practices or observances must be justified with evidence of significant operational impact, per Groff"". My biggest takeaway: don't be a POS, don't abuse it, and you have the legal backing to TW. No one is gunna go to your house to see if you are or are not praying, fasting or whatever you claim to be doing. Also, nowhere does it say that I have to explain myself to anyone why I am requesting a reasonable accommodation for religious purposes. 



**What I did and what you should do too**

So, I requested 1-3 days a week as situational TW, dependent on workload, as a reasonable accommodation for religious purposes. I just said ""based on the memo, I am seeking RA for religious purposes. My beliefs and values are a private matter that I wish to keep private, but to shed some light on why I am seeking this RA:...."" Then to ensure things went as smoothly as possible, I included a few Bible verses to really sell it. Speaking of the Bible, I went the Christian route because that's what I am, but also, if things went sideways down the road, i would use their nonsense against them (which I'll explain in the next section)



The verses I included were these:

**Prayer in solitude**: Matthew 6:6 encourages private prayer, stating, ""But when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen.""

**Fasting and spiritual dedication**: Joel 2:12 and Matthew 6:16-18 emphasize the importance of fasting in humility and privacy as an act of personal spiritual discipline.

**Meditation and scriptural reflection**: Joshua 1:8 advises meditating on the Scriptures, while Psalm 1:2 highlights the blessings associated with meditating on God's Word daily. Likewise, 1 Timothy 4:15 urges believers to practice meditation regularly to deepen their faith and understanding.

**Preparation for Sabbath observance**: Exodus 20:8-10 and Luke 23:54 emphasize the importance of setting aside dedicated time to spiritually prepare for observing the Sabbath.

(If you don't use the bible, use your holy book, ask ChatGPT to find you some verses that covers religious practices, such as Sabbath or holiday observance, scheduled prayers, services, meditation, fasting, or other religious obligations.)



I typed up a letter, sent it on it's way, and a few hours later. I got my reasonable accommodation letter signed and approved. Sweet, ""GREAT SUCCESS!"" (Borat voice lol).

I literally did this the week the memo came out and have not had any issues since. Most weeks I do 2 days of TW, occasionally 3 days, rarely 1 (like I said, don't abuse it, but definitely use it). 



**They want to take it away? Use their tools of fear against them.**

Although my process went well, in the back of my mind, I always feared that it would be taken away and I ran through that scenario in my head. If they tried to take it away, I would've asked them if their local TW policy trumps OPM policy. I could've even taken it a step further and said that because of the Executive Order ""[Eradicating Christian Bias](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/eradicating-anti-christian-bias/)"" I strongly believed that they were now infringing on my religious freedom to TW and I will be reporting them to their supervisor, EEO, and the ""anti christian task force"". I think all of this still has grounds and will cause your leadership to think twice if the juice is the worth the squeeze to try and remove your Religious TW. And as¬†others in this subreddit who have applied for it and gotten it approved have said; the fear is real from higher ups in terms of religious discrimination or being reported for violating the eradicating Christian bias executive order for not approving or accepting the request.



Thankfully, to make this endeavor even more air tight, on Sep 18, the DOJ released the memo that I didn't see get a lot of attention: ""Religious Liberty Protections for Federal Employees in Light of Recent Legal Developments."" Its 15 pages long, a good read, but to sum it up for you, the DOJ told EEOC that: 

**""we conclude that the Return to In-Person Work Memorandum does not preclude‚Äîand, in some circumstances, Title VII may require‚Äîthe appropriate use of situational telework as a form of religious accommodation.""**



Look up the memo for yourself, a lot of good references you could use to back up your request are from pages 10-15. To help you out [I've added a link to one with my highlights](https://pdfhost.io/v/qGWQvL7LzQ_EEOC_memo_on_religious_telework__my_highlights_). Yellow is good info, red is REALLY useful info:

\- Pg 10: ""Read in context of both the President‚Äôs commitment to religious freedom and existing federal law, **we do not see the Return to In-Person Work Memorandum as an impediment to using situational telework as an accommodation for federal employees‚Äô religious practices** in appropriate circumstances""

\- 

\- Pg 12: ""Indeed, OPMwhich is tasked by Congress with providing ‚Äúpolicy and policy guidance‚Äù regarding telework, 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 6504(b)(1), has acknowledged that ‚Äú**situational telework‚Äù is permitted under the memorandum so long as it is intermittent** and not authorized as a substitute for routine or recurring telework.‚Äù



\- Pg 13 (**if your leadership are Trump supporters use his actions to bolseter your request**): ""It would make no sense for a President who has publicly (and repeatedly) committed to protecting religious liberty to the maximum extent allowed by law, see, e.g., Exec. Order No. 13798, 82 Fed. Reg. at 21,675, to simultaneously prohibit minor alterations to work schedules and locations to allow for common religious observances.""



\- More Pg 13: ""even if situational telework were generally implicated by the main clauses of the Return to In-Person Work Memorandum, religious accommodations would still be excluded from the memorandum‚Äôs coverage. The memorandum includes two important qualifications: (1) ‚Äú**department and agency heads shall make exemptions they deem necessary**,‚Äù and (2) the ‚Äúmemorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.‚Äù Both qualifications support the use of situational telework as a form of religious accommodation. The former clearly grants agencies ‚Äú**broad leeway**‚Äù in deciding when to permit telework. **In our view, such leeway includes the power to make exemptions for the protection of individual religious liberty**, a paramount governmental interest recognized by both statute and executive order. In the case of jobs for which the agency can make exemptions, **the fact that agency heads may make exemptions very likely means that \*they must\* make religious accommodations** in appropriate circumstances for the memorandum to be ‚Äúimplemented consistent with applicable law.‚Äù



\- Pg 14 (really put me at ease in terms of taking it away): For positions where agency heads have discretion to permit telework situationally for non-religious purposes, **the prohibition is not generally applicable and the agency may deny religious accommodations only if it can satisfy strict scrutiny. The strict scrutiny standard is ‚Äúunforgiving,‚Äù** but we do not prejudge whether any particular agency will meet it



\- Pg 15 (if they say it's not fair to coworkers or if coworkers complain): Relatedly, we also note that **refusing such an accommodation in the name of purported fairness toward employees who have returned to work would be inconsistent with Title VII. In fact, such an approach would likely violate both Title VII and the Free Exercise Clause because it would reflect ‚Äúhostility‚Äù to ‚Äúthe very notion of accommodating religious practice.**‚Äù Groff, 143 S. Ct. at 2296. Refusals to approve situational telework as a religious accommodation must instead be based solely on the genuine needs of the agency and the specific facts at issue.





This was a longer post, and if you read it all, I appreciate it. It's a lot of words and references. But I did the heavy lifting for ya'll. As I said in the intro, this admin is destroying our government, so take small wins where you can. If you're even the tiniest bit of religious, you're missing out on not doing this. And if you're not religious, who cares? Game the system. They‚Äôre breaking all sorts of laws, doing all sorts of illegal shit, who gives a fuck if people embellish a little to get their TW back. Sign up for it. Get all coworkers on board (or just your friends who didn't vote for this hell we're being put through). I wish you the best of luck friends, I hope this helps you out during the shutdown or post shutdown to get some time back to you and not have to commute or go in the office.

1ok1kkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/complaints/comments/1ok1kkf/call_centers/,Call centers!,"I have a non-political complaint.

I cannot stand call centers where it‚Äôs super hard to understand someone due to their accent (yes, it‚Äôs usually East Asian but I‚Äôd have the same issue if it was thick Scottish or French one too). I‚Äôm already frustrated with something. Then I have to wait on hold for an hour or press ten zillion buttons to get a person. And then I have to focus hard to understand through the accent. And the poor person on the other end of the line has to deal with my lack of emotional regulation because I‚Äôm at the end of my rope by then. 

And it can‚Äôt just be me as these reps have gotten pretty salty. One lady told me to go have a cup a coffee and calm down (I actually apologized to her a few times prior for my frustration and said I knew it wasn‚Äôt her fault). Another guy berated me for using a mild curse word. 

And in the end many have eventually discovered they can‚Äôt help me and transferred me back to someone in the US who could.

If you‚Äôre gonna use a foreign call center just send us straight to a person so we aren‚Äôt frustrated after navigating the maze of buttons. And maybe use a linguistic coach so the accents are a bit more clear and I don‚Äôt have to ask 3x for it to be repeated.

Complaint over. I do not blame the people on the other end. They are working hard and trying.

One moment we stepped forward, and the next we were somewhere that wasn‚Äôt anywhere ‚Äî just a sea of black, thick and endless. There was no sound, no up or down, just the faint sense of moving without moving. It felt like we had been walking for years, maybe longer, but at the same time‚Ä¶ it couldn‚Äôt have been more than a second before we found ourselves in a room.

Immediately we were on edge, I mean could you blame us? The things we have seen‚Ä¶ We need to get the hell out of here.
But as I looked around the room I couldn‚Äôt help but feel‚Ä¶ safe? Well maybe safer is the correct term here

We were in a room. Just‚Ä¶ a normal room. Beige walls. Drop ceiling. Fluorescent lights that didn‚Äôt flicker for once. There was a table with half drank coffees and strewn about bagels that seemed to be genuine, real food for once. The smell hit me and I almost cried. Veronica touched the table too, like she needed to make sure it wouldn‚Äôt disappear if she blinked.
‚ÄúHey Matteo, take a look at this.‚Äù Veronica called me over, and as I turned in her direction I saw it.

The wall she was looking at had a bunch of framed pictures on it, with the words ‚ÄúEMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH‚Äù in big bold lettering above it.

Looking at the frames what took me by surprise was the perfectly legible text beneath every picture:

‚ÄúHumans served: 500.‚Äù Underneath the first picture I looked with my eyes widening as I saw the more recent pictures, their misspelled months above their frames.

‚ÄúHumans served: 1,000.‚Äù

‚ÄúHumans served: ‚Äú2,300.‚Äù

‚ÄúHumans served: ‚Äú5,000.‚Äù

All of these paled to the most recent picture, containing something I can‚Äôt even describe‚Ä¶ just an absolute abomination. That sickly shiny skin, the twisted angles, those eyes‚Ä¶ It was all too much. 

‚ÄúHumans served: 10,000.‚Äù Next to the plaque there was a sticker of a golden star with ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a star!‚Äù In the middle. 

I laughed, not because it was funny but because of how absurd this place is. Some bizarre thing out there saw how humans transacted business and recreated it into this twisted monstrosity.

‚ÄúHey, I think I found our way out.‚Äù Veronica said before walking over and handing me a pamphlet. I could've sworn she was right next to me looking at this wall just a second ago, where did she get this?

‚ÄúWhere did this come from?‚Äù I ask immediately, looking over the pamphlet which says ‚ÄúWelcome Valued Employee!‚Äù On its covers.

‚ÄúOn the table over there.‚Äù Veronica replied plainly, but there was something about how she spoke that I couldn't place. Her demeanor and voice seemed different than it was just moments ago.

‚ÄúAre you gonna read it?‚Äù She quipped, annoyed at me just holding it.

""Hello Valued Employee! 

Welcome to the one and only Abaddon Emporium, the one stop shop for customer supplies! Do you need a new skin suit? Or maybe you‚Äôd rather one of our beautiful faced boxes, full of transfigured life within them!

No matter what a customer might need it is YOUR responsibility to make sure that they get it, lest you want to become a part of the supplies we sell here! Now lets go through the basics before we release you:

1. YOU are our direct line to the customer, so remember to SMILE and SERVE! Your face will be what customers remember most of this experience, so make sure it‚Äôs good!

2. ALWAYS wear your uniforms! Yes the skin may be tight around you but what matters is that your uniform is on! Don‚Äôt want any of that fuzz escaping and leaving you deflated now would we?

3. Ignore any signs that are not written in plain English, as those are not there to guide you.

4. Absolutely NO humans are allowed to be roaming the facilities! We are a brand built on product quality, and letting humans get damaged DOES NOT MEAN QUALITY.

5. Any coworkers acting weird? Touch them! If you feel a heart beating then DING DING DING you found a human ready to be added to our inventory! Take great care in transporting them, they can put up quite the fight if they‚Äôre awake!

6. A lot of silly humans end up at the gas station, having taken a wrong turn somewhere along their path that puts them right into ours! They‚Äôll come scooting along in their vehicles ready to be caught! It is your responsibility to NEVER let them reverse their vehicle; always keep it moving forwards. 

Here at the Abaddon Emporium we pride ourselves in our work, and we want to do the same! The better you perform the more perks you will get. Want a more powerful form? Or maybe you want to get some of our products for free? Well serve humans and you sure will be able to have that and more!

Questions? Head on over to our HR Department on floor 1324!

- The Abaddon Team""

What. The. Fuck.
With my hands shaking I let the pamphlet fall onto the floor in front of me. I hadn‚Äôt even fully registered what I said before Veronica spoke up again.

‚ÄúWhy are you acting so scared? This is our way out!!‚Äù She exclaimed way more excitedly than she should, as if the implication of that pamphlet wasn‚Äôt horrifying.

Sensing my judgement and meeting my gaze she adjusted, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying that this is the first time I‚Äôve seen ANY mention on how this place operates. We can use the uniforms to blend in and get out of here!‚Äù

I could not help but frown at the idea of wearing skin over my own, which made me feel sick. 

‚ÄúOkay so we blend in and get out of here. Then what?‚Äù I asked, hoping she was seeing something that I didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúNo idea.‚Äù She said flatly. ‚ÄúBut knowing that there is a chance we can get out of here is enough for me to try.‚Äù

She was right. As things stood now we would eventually be caught and reimprisoned, if not worse. While I was still trying to process what we‚Äôd just read, Veronica wandered off toward a small closet door by the vending machine, ‚ÄúUniforms‚Äù written across it in plain white text. 

As Veronica pulled the door open a wave of cold air poured out. Inside, hung neatly like any other work uniforms, were rows of pale fleshy things. They had zippers running down their backs, and some of the faces stitched into them twitched when the light hit. Veronica just stared for a long time, then turned back to me with this expression I couldn‚Äôt read. ‚ÄúGuess we found our uniforms,‚Äù she said.

As she reached for one of the uniforms I swore the rest leaned toward her. I wanted to stop her, to tell her this was a crazy idea and we could come up with something else ‚Äî something less risky, but the look in her eyes wasn‚Äôt fear anymore, it was acceptance.

And that terrified me more than anything else in this place.

Productive labour is supposed to be labour that creates surplus value for the capitalist, i.e. puts more money into the capitalists hands than they put into paying the labourer. Jobs said to be unproductive in a marxist sense also serve this purpose though.

A maid or personal chef gives the capitalist surplus value if they use the free time they now have from not cooking or cleaning to make more money. You could say the maid only gives the capitalist 'opportunity' to make more money, but that is true for the farmer also. If the capitalist gets crops from the farmer and they don't hire a driver to deliver them or pay a shopkeeper to sell them or waits until they are gone rotten to do any of this, there's no money gained. The farmer only gave the capitalist an opportunity to make money, which is useless unless everyone else also does their jobs. A barista is said to provide unproductive labour, but again this makes no sense. Fill a coffee shop with beans and don't employ any staff to open the doors and sell coffee, see how much money you make (no money). Maintenance is said to be unproductive work, again this makes no sense. If you have a broken house and you fix it up, that is no different to building a house, except in scale. A broke house is not a house. It doesn't serve its function, you can't live in it, it's worth less money. Fix the house and it's worth more money than it was before you fixed it, so value has been added",1,1761835314.0,AskSocialists,7,0.6,False
1ok1kb0,https://i.redd.it/pbupvv5xg9yf1.jpeg,Newbie Setup,"For my birthday in May of this year, I received the Bambino plus and a really cheap grinder. Needless to say I was super thankful for the setup. 

I quickly realized it was impossible to create consistency with the grind size and the coffee tasted terrible. I tried to stick it out but ended up picking up the JX-Pro shortly after. This really helped the quality of my coffee and I started to really enjoy the process. 

Since then, I‚Äôve been researching and I found a good deal on a Eureka Specialita on FB marketplace. The quality of this grinder is insane and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my purchase. 

Looking forward to when my espresso machine needs an upgrade down the road. I think the Profitec GO is where I may land, though I think this upgrade is a year or two away.

Hi!

I currently use the Bialetti Brikka Induction 4tz with pressure valve and I'm happy with the taste, but due to health beliefs I'm looking for a fully stainless steel alternative. Unfortunately Brikka has the upper chamber made of aluminum.

I've tried induction moka pots like New Venus 6tz and Mokka Induction 6tz, but honestly, their coffee comes out too watery and lacking flavor. I think it's the Brikka's pressure valve that does the good job.

I'm looking for recommendations on a stainless steel moka pot that:
- works on an induction cooktop
- volume anywhere between 2-4tz
- sturdy (""buy it for life"")
- can deliver coffee that is at least as good as my Brikka, if not better.

If you've got suggestions or personal favorites that fit these criteria, please share!
Also keen to hear if some of the premium options like Giannini Giannina Restyling live up to the hype.

Thanks in advance!

My use case is essentially that I have gotten tired of baristas variation of what is considered a latte. More often than not, it feels like I am drinking a coffee flavored glass of milk. Or, other times, half of the cup is empty and just foam bubbles. Which you could argue is what a latte is and I should be ordering something stronger or without foam...but I still want a large drink, just more espresso and less milk.

Anyways, I would like to start making this at home. But I do not want to become a tedious espresso master. Ideally, I would like to hit a button and a 20 oz latte would pop out but I understand that isn't realistic. On the other end, I don't want to spend 20 minutes waiting for a machine to fire up, pulling two shots at a time, refilling everything, pulling another two shots, waiting for the milk to steam, refill that, then wait again, and then finally pouring. All requiring my full attention.

Is there anything that more suits this use case within entry budget? Again, it doesn't have to be perfect, as long as you can call it espresso, that is good with me. Do any of the options I mention do that better than others?",1,1761835289.0,espresso,8,1.0,False

I was a server for a summer 3 years ago, but have worked in my field (music therapy) since then. I know people need resumes to be short and snappy nowadays , so should I just put my current MT job at the top and the job from 3 years ago right after? That‚Äôs my first thought but I want to avoid there being a huge gap in my resume. Thanks yall! I‚Äôve always wanted to be a barista and thought I would enjoy it so needing these morning hours may be a blessing in disguise.

Case #004 ""The Man in our Dreams""","Have you ever driven down a long highway late at night in the rain? The sound of water hitting the metallic roof and the silent purr of the engine make it almost impossible not to at least feel tired. I was in the passenger seat of Lily's car; we had just driven out into the rural country to investigate the claims of a ""goat man"". These claims were false, but it wasn't a bad trip at all. Lily had come back from her secret assignment, and I had missed her company.

I sat semi-reclined in the passenger seat, staring out at the trees passing us by and occasionally focusing on a raindrop sliding across the glass window. I had become all too comfortable sleeping in this car. I still felt weird about motels, and after my last case, I hadn't been getting the best quality sleep. Bad things are one thing, but my mind kept going back to that attic, the hole.

""Elijah, do you need a coffee break?"" Lily said as we slowed down to a crawl, she pointed out a diner up ahead, but I just waved her suggestion off. I closed my eyes and let whatever my body was telling me take effect; it was saying the word ""sleep"".

I could feel myself slip away, and for a moment I could almost hear the whispering from the hole. I could make out the details of the attic, and then suddenly it all turned to fog and drifted away, like smoke in the wind. I fell for a moment before hitting something plump and comfortable hard.

  
My head hit something, and I jolted up and looked around. I was in a diner, one that looked like it was from the 1950s. Everyone inside was wearing time-appropriate clothes and drinking milkshakes with cream and cherries layered on top of them. I heard the familiar sound of a bell ringing and a door opening. I shifted my eyes towards the direction of the entrance and saw a man wearing a trenchcoat and a fine suit; he was focused on me with a smile.

‚ÄúElijah, my boy, look at you,‚Äù he said. He lifted his arms in a hugging gesture before doing what I can only describe as a half dance and half skip over to me and giving me a half-sided hug before sitting in the booth across from me. 

‚ÄúIt has been far, far too long since I‚Äôve seen you, and look at how well you‚Äôve done for yourself, field research agent for the [Redacted].‚Äù He clapped his hands together and chuckled. ‚ÄúTruly impressive, my friend,‚Äù he added. 

The man's dark skin shone with what must‚Äôve been rain, although when I looked out the window all I saw was dark, swirling fog.

‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù I asked. I kept looking around at my surroundings; it was difficult not to take in all of the hazy imagery around us. 

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm sorry, Elijah. I thought this would be comforting for you; most people like to dream of places they feel comfortable in,‚Äù he said. He sounded genuinely apologetic, and he waved his hand out, and the people, signs, food and furniture dissipated into fog before reforming into slightly modern variants of what they once were.

‚ÄúIs that better?‚Äù he asked, and I got the sense that it was genuine.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶. Thanks, is this‚Ä¶ you know, real?‚Äù I asked and felt stupid for asking, but he just gave me a smirk and a nod.

‚ÄúDepends on what you mean by ‚Äòreal‚Äô. Are you really experiencing this? Well then yes. Are we in the realm that you consider to be the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô? Well then no,‚Äù he said with a chuckle.¬†

""This is a dream; I'm dreaming, right?"" I said, which made him nod once again.

""There you are, Elijah. See, I knew you were a smart cookie,"" he said before putting his hand into the air. 

""Are you hungry?"" A second later fog crept up from under the table, and I jumped back. The fog swirled in front of me before forming into the shape of eggs on toast with beans?

""You're favourite, right?"" he said with a smile. He was right; it was my favourite, but more than that, it was perfect. The eggs were done how I like them, and they used wholemeal instead of white bread. Even the ratio of the beans was just like I liked them. 

""Who the fuck are you?"" I said whilst staring the man in the eyes. He moved his hands up defensively. An odd gesture, as I was pretty certain he had some level of control over the environment around us. I wasn't sure what he could do, but I knew I couldn't trust him.

""Elijah. I am a friend. Seriously, have a try of the eggs; I've heard they're perfect,"" he said while gesturing to the plate of food that sat in front of me. I had no interest in trying them.

I looked at the man for a long time; something about him was strikingly familiar, but not in the way that you'd recognise an old friend or a lover from years before. It was like recognising your own shadow; he had no recognisable features, and there was no real way for me to know who this was, yet deep down, I recognised this shadow as mine.

""I've seen you before,"" I asked cautiously; the smile on the man's face grew silently, and he nodded.

""A time ago, although from in here I can't really say,"" he chuckled before waving his hand in front of him, and fog rose up and formed into a glass mug. He lifted the mug to his lips and took a drink. 

The man acted like we were old friends reminiscing on the good old days. I was afraid to push further into this conversation, but I didn't see a choice. 

""So then, friend, what should I call you?"" I said as friendly as I could. My hand was shaking as I reached out and grabbed a side of the toast and took a bite, making a show of trust. He smiled at this. 

""I have been called a few things by a few people: The Dreamer, Tutu, Phantasos, but you, my friend, can simply call me Imani,"" he said whilst urging me to continue to eat. ""How are the eggs? Describe them to me."" 

""They're fine, nothing too crazy,"" I answered and was met with a clap from Imani and a ""Goddamn, I'm good."" 

""Do you know how difficult it is to replicate taste in this realm? Of course people dream of taste, but it's been so long since I've been able to experience it that I'm going off of words,"" he said, looking quite pleased with himself. 

""Ahhh, well, I'll tell you what, Elijah, I don't want to hold you for any longer than I have, and you've got me in a good mood. I knew talking with you would go well,"" he said, pointing a finger at me. ""You, my friend, have been marked. Something is after you, and whatever limitations or bindings someone had placed on it are gone. It's coming, Elijah."" 

As he said this, the image of the shadowman appeared in the fog outside the diner for a short second before being engulfed by the tempest of winds, then the hole appeared with Maddison sitting next to it; that too had drifted away. 

""Elijah, look at me, focus on what I say. This realm can be tricky to work in; it's malleable to the human consciousness. This is why I need to say this quick: they may have a foothold in you somewhere, but they aren't the things after you.""

""Okay, what is it?"" I asked.

""Ah ah ah,"" he said whilst wiggling his finger at me. He placed a folded piece of paper onto the table and flashed a smile. ""When you open this, you'll know, but I need to know that when I call on you, you shall answer, for whatever I need,"" he said. His mouth was smiling, but his eyes told a different story.  

""And you just expect me to trust you, some random psychic who jumped into my dream and is holding information over my head,"" I said with a slightly raised voice. Everyone in the diner stopped to stare, and with a squint of Imani's eyebrow, they melted into fog before forming into the furniture around them.

""Elijah, don't be stupid. You're asking the wrong questions to the right person. This realm doesn't have space for people like psychics. Psychics manipulate your realm with their mind. Well, guess what? This realm is constantly manipulated by the collective power of dreams. Your psychics have no power here, nor do your gods, nor do those entities coming for you. Everything dreams, Elijah, everything except for me,"" he said before pushing the paper to me. I held it in my hand and opened it. 


I shot awake in Lily's car, and she swerved slightly in the lane.

""Fucking Christ, Elijah!"" she said whilst correcting the trajectory of the car

I didn't respond; I was too focused on the image in my head. The paper didn't have words written down on it, and yet I took it in all the same. The image was of my childhood backyard. It was night. I stood seemingly alone, but I knew there was another there, a man. no, that isn't an accurate term for whatever it was. That thing stood in my bushes, taller than a man should be and pale enough to glow in the dark. Its smile should've cut its cheeks open, but they stayed sealed. William Grey, my boogeyman, my monster underneath my bed, the entity hunting me, is now free. ",5,1761835174.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

I sat semi-reclined in the passenger seat, staring out at the trees passing us by and occasionally focusing on a raindrop sliding across the glass window. I had become all too comfortable sleeping in this car. I still felt weird about motels, and after my last case, I hadn't been getting the best quality sleep. Bad things are one thing, but my mind kept going back to that attic, the hole.

""Elijah, do you need a coffee break?"" Lily said as we slowed down to a crawl, she pointed out a diner up ahead, but I just waved her suggestion off. I closed my eyes and let whatever my body was telling me take effect; it was saying the word ""sleep"".

I could feel myself slip away, and for a moment I could almost hear the whispering from the hole. I could make out the details of the attic, and then suddenly it all turned to fog and drifted away, like smoke in the wind. I fell for a moment before hitting something plump and comfortable hard.

  
My head hit something, and I jolted up and looked around. I was in a diner, one that looked like it was from the 1950s. Everyone inside was wearing time-appropriate clothes and drinking milkshakes with cream and cherries layered on top of them. I heard the familiar sound of a bell ringing and a door opening. I shifted my eyes towards the direction of the entrance and saw a man wearing a trenchcoat and a fine suit; he was focused on me with a smile.

‚ÄúElijah, my boy, look at you,‚Äù he said. He lifted his arms in a hugging gesture before doing what I can only describe as a half dance and half skip over to me and giving me a half-sided hug before sitting in the booth across from me. 

‚ÄúIt has been far, far too long since I‚Äôve seen you, and look at how well you‚Äôve done for yourself, field research agent for the [Redacted].‚Äù He clapped his hands together and chuckled. ‚ÄúTruly impressive, my friend,‚Äù he added. 

The man's dark skin shone with what must‚Äôve been rain, although when I looked out the window all I saw was dark, swirling fog.

‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù I asked. I kept looking around at my surroundings; it was difficult not to take in all of the hazy imagery around us. 

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm sorry, Elijah. I thought this would be comforting for you; most people like to dream of places they feel comfortable in,‚Äù he said. He sounded genuinely apologetic, and he waved his hand out, and the people, signs, food and furniture dissipated into fog before reforming into slightly modern variants of what they once were.

‚ÄúIs that better?‚Äù he asked, and I got the sense that it was genuine.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶. Thanks, is this‚Ä¶ you know, real?‚Äù I asked and felt stupid for asking, but he just gave me a smirk and a nod.

‚ÄúDepends on what you mean by ‚Äòreal‚Äô. Are you really experiencing this? Well then yes. Are we in the realm that you consider to be the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô? Well then no,‚Äù he said with a chuckle.¬†

""This is a dream; I'm dreaming, right?"" I said, which made him nod once again.

""There you are, Elijah. See, I knew you were a smart cookie,"" he said before putting his hand into the air. 

""Are you hungry?"" A second later fog crept up from under the table, and I jumped back. The fog swirled in front of me before forming into the shape of eggs on toast with beans?

""You're favourite, right?"" he said with a smile. He was right; it was my favourite, but more than that, it was perfect. The eggs were done how I like them, and they used wholemeal instead of white bread. Even the ratio of the beans was just like I liked them. 

""Who the fuck are you?"" I said whilst staring the man in the eyes. He moved his hands up defensively. An odd gesture, as I was pretty certain he had some level of control over the environment around us. I wasn't sure what he could do, but I knew I couldn't trust him.

""Elijah. I am a friend. Seriously, have a try of the eggs; I've heard they're perfect,"" he said while gesturing to the plate of food that sat in front of me. I had no interest in trying them.

I looked at the man for a long time; something about him was strikingly familiar, but not in the way that you'd recognise an old friend or a lover from years before. It was like recognising your own shadow; he had no recognisable features, and there was no real way for me to know who this was, yet deep down, I recognised this shadow as mine.

""I've seen you before,"" I asked cautiously; the smile on the man's face grew silently, and he nodded.

""A time ago, although from in here I can't really say,"" he chuckled before waving his hand in front of him, and fog rose up and formed into a glass mug. He lifted the mug to his lips and took a drink. 

The man acted like we were old friends reminiscing on the good old days. I was afraid to push further into this conversation, but I didn't see a choice. 

""So then, friend, what should I call you?"" I said as friendly as I could. My hand was shaking as I reached out and grabbed a side of the toast and took a bite, making a show of trust. He smiled at this. 

""I have been called a few things by a few people: The Dreamer, Tutu, Phantasos, but you, my friend, can simply call me Imani,"" he said whilst urging me to continue to eat. ""How are the eggs? Describe them to me."" 

""They're fine, nothing too crazy,"" I answered and was met with a clap from Imani and a ""Goddamn, I'm good."" 

""Do you know how difficult it is to replicate taste in this realm? Of course people dream of taste, but it's been so long since I've been able to experience it that I'm going off of words,"" he said, looking quite pleased with himself. 

""Ahhh, well, I'll tell you what, Elijah, I don't want to hold you for any longer than I have, and you've got me in a good mood. I knew talking with you would go well,"" he said, pointing a finger at me. ""You, my friend, have been marked. Something is after you, and whatever limitations or bindings someone had placed on it are gone. It's coming, Elijah."" 

As he said this, the image of the shadowman appeared in the fog outside the diner for a short second before being engulfed by the tempest of winds, then the hole appeared with Maddison sitting next to it; that too had drifted away. 

""Elijah, look at me, focus on what I say. This realm can be tricky to work in; it's malleable to the human consciousness. This is why I need to say this quick: they may have a foothold in you somewhere, but they aren't the things after you.""

""Okay, what is it?"" I asked.

""Ah ah ah,"" he said whilst wiggling his finger at me. He placed a folded piece of paper onto the table and flashed a smile. ""When you open this, you'll know, but I need to know that when I call on you, you shall answer, for whatever I need,"" he said. His mouth was smiling, but his eyes told a different story.  

""And you just expect me to trust you, some random psychic who jumped into my dream and is holding information over my head,"" I said with a slightly raised voice. Everyone in the diner stopped to stare, and with a squint of Imani's eyebrow, they melted into fog before forming into the furniture around them.

""Elijah, don't be stupid. You're asking the wrong questions to the right person. This realm doesn't have space for people like psychics. Psychics manipulate your realm with their mind. Well, guess what? This realm is constantly manipulated by the collective power of dreams. Your psychics have no power here, nor do your gods, nor do those entities coming for you. Everything dreams, Elijah, everything except for me,"" he said before pushing the paper to me. I held it in my hand and opened it. 


I shot awake in Lily's car, and she swerved slightly in the lane.

""Fucking Christ, Elijah!"" she said whilst correcting the trajectory of the car

I didn't respond; I was too focused on the image in my head. The paper didn't have words written down on it, and yet I took it in all the same. The image was of my childhood backyard. It was night. I stood seemingly alone, but I knew there was another there, a man. no, that isn't an accurate term for whatever it was. That thing stood in my bushes, taller than a man should be and pale enough to glow in the dark. Its smile should've cut its cheeks open, but they stayed sealed.

The recipe is Babish's ultimate chocolate chip cookies, my only problem with the recipe is it calls for finely ground Hazelnut Coffee. I love the taste of Hazelnut so i would like to keep that in the recipe but i hate the taste of coffee and none of the people attending the party are particularly in love with coffee either. Ive already confirmed no one at the party has any nut allergens (still going to make a card to sit on the plate warning people bout the ingredients just in case)

  
So my questions are what are some ways i could substitute the Hazelnut coffee but keep the Hazlenut flavor and maybe what are some considerations to keep in mind when doing this substitute?  I thought about just adding ground hazelnut or maybe using hazelnut extract if i can find it?.. do yall think that would work???

It won't be my everyday bag; I really bought it because most of my dresses and skirts don't have pockets (unfortunately...). With this cute bag, I don't have to keep my phone in my hand at work when I walk from my office to a colleague elsewhere in the building. And in the summer I can also easily take my phone and keys with me when I walk the dog. 

I will definitely not put too much in it, because the shoulder strap is so thin, it will definitely cut into my shoulder. So, just for my phone, keys, and lip balm. 



I do wonder how long it will take for the inner lining to break; it's only a thin layer of fabric, and I'm afraid the eyelets will eventually poke through. For this amount of money they could have made it a little better in my opinion.

I actually wanted the coffee-to-go bag as well, but if it's as fragile on the inside as this one, I think I'll stick with the toast bag.

Let‚Äôs be honest, a lot of us are just looking for good friendships or meaningful connections with someone from the opposite gender.

I‚Äôm sure there are girls too who would love to find a good guy friend, but they can‚Äôt post openly because their DMs would get flooded with creeps.

So, with completely genuine intentions, here‚Äôs a simple idea:
All the guys can make the first move by commenting under this post. Just write a small intro with:

‚Ä¢Your Name/Nickname initial
‚Ä¢Age
‚Ä¢Height
‚Ä¢What you‚Äôre studying/working on (optional)
‚Ä¢And one short line that describes you (keep it clean and decent).

Bas itna hi !! 
Then, girls can go through the comments and DM anyone they feel a good vibe with.
We‚Äôre all anonymous here, if the vibe doesn‚Äôt match, you can always block and move on. No pressure, no drama.

I really hope both guys and girls participate actively. I‚Äôm sure this can lead to some amazing friendships ‚Äî and maybe even something beyond that.
If this goes well, I‚Äôll make a post like this every week. Just remember: keep things respectful and genuine.

1ok15vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1ok15vv/devblog_72_plenty_of_qol_changes_and_a_new_office/,DevBlog #72: Plenty of QoL changes and a new office!,"[The next content update has a rather... horrifying new location?](https://preview.redd.it/a9k75ooid9yf1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=3892fc8d9d0900a2f0fe2f2981df3a63b5c8ea06)

Hello and welcome to DevBlog #72!

This time, we'll show a bunch of QoL changes that I added to the game for the next update and we'll be showing off our new office we moved to that is now pretty much finished!

# New office space

[Woah, we have three desks now!](https://preview.redd.it/lbm6lcfpd9yf1.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=0db6fd3352703e91d88710a435b9701e0b081584)

We have moved just recently to a bigger office space (inside the same building). Our goal is to hire one more developer later this year or early next year, and our previous space could only have two desks, so a bigger place was needed.

A bigger office and hiring a new developer does increase our expenses quite a bit. This is why we've been running some ads on Meta's platform like some of you might've noticed so we could increase our Patreon & BMAC income in preparation for the new hire.

We rarely ask people to support us financially in these devblogs. But if you haven't supported WalkScape on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/WalkScape) or [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/walkscape) yet, now that we'll be hiring any bit of support would be really helpful!

[And another pic of our new office!](https://preview.redd.it/rdidgy6rd9yf1.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c2586607f33b5d7f471bcd74f1c81884808cd72)

# Plenty of small QoL changes

[This region here has been evolving even further since the last devblog](https://preview.redd.it/y0umeiisd9yf1.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0074fef334dce12d796b5ca76f5dd35e815b8c)

I did add a bunch of smaller QoL features to the upcoming update as well, and I'll probably keep adding more of these on the side while working on the big stuff! Let's go through some of them.

**Inventory sorting & deposit all button**

[There's now a sort button to quickly organize your items in inventory!](https://preview.redd.it/vcyjbr5ud9yf1.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=00181215ecd64370d733b92202c8dd2d4fd6b7c7)

We've added two new buttons to the inventory - sort & deposit all!

These should help a bit to keep the inventory more tidy, and making banking quicker.

The sorting button sorts the inventory as follows:

1. Crafted/Looted items, sorted by rarity.
2. Consumables, fines first and then normal ones.
3. Materials, fines first and then normal ones.

If there are multiple different items of the same rarity, then it'll use alphabetical sorting.

**Complete for X actions**

[You can now set to complete X amount of actions for an activity - this also works if you queue an activity after traveling!](https://preview.redd.it/ldhi6nivd9yf1.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef3bb5221607d3951d9a343185838df56e26273)

This has been requested quite a lot, and I've added systems to expand the activity ""options"" so that we can add more stuff like this to activities. Likely the next one I'll be adding is complete until X level.

**Work efficiency breakdown**

[You'll be able to see a breakdown of what's giving you work efficiency directly in the activity view - including your bonus from leveling!](https://preview.redd.it/tym608xwd9yf1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e2d8bd972d7cacb172c6a05a1c1998883ae67f7)

Now you can see your WE and the WE cap in the activity view, and when you tap it you can see a breakdown of what is affecting your Work Efficiency!

**Unifying the two separate gear set pages**

[Gear set management has now been combined to a single page](https://preview.redd.it/fj6mw3fyd9yf1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=c72fdfe948c6612a4a6a3dcb9d700d57aee08a72)

We unified the two separate pages for gear set management into one, and now you can edit, equip or withdraw your gearsets all from the same menu.

**Minor changes**

* A setting added to disable Agility XP while traveling. This is aimed for challenge characters.
* You can now also withdraw a gearset from bank without equipping it.
* WalkPedia now remembers which categories you had opened on previous pages.
* WalkPedia is ordered alphabetically.
* You can also use item's abilities from the inventory view.
* Crafting Outcome renamed to Quality Outcome.
* Pressing minus button while at minimum value on shops, crafting view, etc. will put the value to max value.
* Added a button to hide the overlays in world map view, so you can admire maxchill's art in full glory!
* Game Version added to character data exports to help 3rd party tool developers.
* Basic tools have been split from Copper tools by making Copper tools require level 2.

# What's being worked on

[There's also another new location that's being added in the upcoming update...](https://preview.redd.it/79ot1nqzd9yf1.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=5510e8eefdb63947d6e33328374a8fe88f169aaf)

Currently, we have basically three separate things being worked on.

The Content Team (meaning Weasel & maxchill) are working on a large (maybe the biggest so far) content update. And to make it clear - we have devtools and capacity to do new content & try it out without taking any time from me and myzozoz. So working on content doesn't affect the feature development.

Myzozoz is currently working on one of the big three missing features until we can start Open Beta. That requires a lot of work, and is going to need a lot of smaller systems to be implemented & working. These smaller things will be released in their own updates once they're ready, and we expect the feature itself to take a few months to be completed.

I'm currently working on a bunch of gameplay features, so we can also introduce new gameplay features & make more varied content in the future. At some point I'll also need to jump in to help myzozoz with the very big stuff, but that'll likely still take some time until that happens, so I'm doing my best to create features needed for new skills, new types of content, and so on!

# Until next time

That's all for this devblog! I hope you enjoyed reading it. And like said, everyone in the team is currently working on bigger updates, meaning that it'll still take some time until the next update is ready.

Also, when it comes to the hiring, we're looking to hire someone who can primarily be available on-site as a full time developer. And if you happen to be in Helsinki (or nearby, our office is in Arabia) and you're a developer looking for a new job, you can send us an email to [support@walkscape.app](mailto:support@walkscape.app)!

I usually drink around 200+ mg of caffeine a day and take ADHD medication (10-20 mg Ritalin). 

Ever since I found out I was pregnant (I'm 6 weeks now), I've been drinking one cup of coffee in the morning and taking an occasional 5 to 10 mg of Ritalin (not every day). This combination doesn't do much for me, but it's better than nothing.

From what I've seen on Reddit, many people continue to take their ADHD medication throughout pregnancy and their babies end up fine. However, I'm kind of worried about the effects of combining it with caffeine. Have been thinking about 10-20mg of Ritalin as needed and trying to quit caffeine. Has anyone had experience with this?

1ok0zn9,https://i.redd.it/qwkz5c1ec9yf1.png,I built a tool for us and friends to use while building my startup as a side project and it accidentally took off. What I learned from it and what I will incorporate to our real project,"Hi everyone!

¬†We all know that time = money someway or another. While building Evanto and being involved in few associations at the same time, I noticed How much time I spent in meetings that could have been just quick slack/email message chain. I wanted to track in easy way how much money we were using in meetings and was it a waste of time, or should I say money. I also wanted to quickly share the cost to other people. So I built [meetingcost.online](http://meetingcost.online) in couple of days in Lovable. Originally I was just going to keep this private with my friends, but decided to make it public but not advertise or market it anywhere.

But then one of my friends shared a photo from one of his meetings online and suddenly I got some real users outside my own circle. I even saw a post on reddit at r/ITManagers where someone had used my app!!

Here are my key takeaways and learnings that I will use on my primary project:

1. Never underestimate the power of social media, keep your products branding visible and make it easy for users to share it.

2. provide some value, shock factor, fun factor or something else for users, that they can share.

3. Make a tool easy for everyone to use, but keep also features for power users.¬†

4. Keep making simple side-projects while building. For me it helped to realise new approaches, learn customer behaviour and even got ideas for my main project.¬†

as some of you know, I'm working on a 4K remaster of Alive 2007 Chicago since some months. I originally wanted to finish to project in September, but numerous things, including significant problems with hardware and software and private life, hindered me from finishing the whole thing. Problems with my hardware have increased so much that 4 minutes of rendering using the best and latest AI model take up to 22 hours,  
which entails a huge electricity consumption. So far I was only able to render about 30 out of 130 minutes. This is no longer acceptable for me, and it increases the waiting time for you guys as well, so I wanted to ask you how I should proceed:

A: I use a comparatively inferior AI model that has a more artificial, but clean look than the model I've used so far = decreases rendering time by a lot.

B: I use an AI model that simply cleans up artifacts and upscales the video without revealing new details (detail and resolution will look similar to the source)

C: I completely drop the AI workflow and remaster it using Resolve (adding film grain, artifact removal, color grading = DVD/film look, resolution will look the same as the source)

D: Mixing options A B and C, would probably look closest to the previous work.

(E: Render the remaining footage in the Topaz cloud, would cost around 200$ to render, support would be greatly appreciated and needed)

Write me in the comments what you guys want, if the majority wants me to do option E, I'd ask for your support via Buy-Me-A-Coffee since it costs so much, but if you don't want to spend your money for the project, it'd be completely fine for me, however I wouldn't be able and willing to spend 200$ on my own for it and I'd proceed with Option A, B, C or D.

I apologize very much again for the lack of updates and progress on this project, but don't worry, I won't give up on it!
