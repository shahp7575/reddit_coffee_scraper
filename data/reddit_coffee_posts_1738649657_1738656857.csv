1ihcxa5,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ihcxa5/breaking_a_hyperfixation/,Breaking a hyperfixation?,"Well, I have good news and bad news. The good news is I can finally focus on my school work! The bad news is I can only focus on my one math course--I literally just started today and I have already completed both all my work for the week (it's daily. It was supposed to last me five days) plus a bunch of extra practice problems. I was out with a friend and I ended up completely ignoring them while they were talking to me because I pulled out some paper and started doing more practice sets. I skipped lunch to work on this. My wrist and hand are cramping. It's now 3am, I have to get up at 6, and there is no sign of me stopping. I at least stopped for dinner when my stomach started cramping and have since had a coffee, but that has been the entirety of my sustenance for the day. 

Even as I write this, my brain is on math. I can't stop it. I've been looking online for tips on breaking a hyperfixation and none of them seem to apply to me: it's not as simple as setting a timer and cutting myself off, because my brain is on the one track and simply will not focus on anything else. Normally I let my hyperfixations run their course because I can still force myself onto other tracks when needed, but this is my worst one yet; it's completely taking over my life.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to break this before it consumes me and I develop a pressure ulcer from sitting at my desk? (Also- is this a medication thing? I just recently started Foquest--aka Adhansia in the States--and I'd found my hyperfixations had went down. I thought I needed to increase my dose some more, but maybe it's the opposite? Or was this just a normal non-ADHD interest that morphed into an all-consuming hyperfixation when it wore off and I rebounded in the evening? That could make sense because Foquest had a dip in concentration right at lunchtime, but I was able to focus on my other classes in the afternoon). I'm genuinely considering taking the day off tomorrow to do more math. I'm *desperate* here.

My partner (F, early 20s) and I (M, early 20s) have been dating since March 2023. I love her deeply, and she means a lot to me. However, we’ve had a really difficult year, and I’m struggling with how to handle an important conversation we have coming up.

Back in July 2024, she told me something that completely shocked me—over the past few years, she had been secretly taking a significant amount of money from one of her parents. They had just found out, and to make up for it, they told her she had to join the military and use her salary for a couple of years to repay the debt. This also meant putting her university studies on hold.
The months that followed were emotionally intense. She was devastated, leaned on me for constant emotional support, and frequently talked about her declining mental health—but refused to seek professional help, fearing it would prevent her from getting into the military.

Over time, I started to feel overwhelmed. I struggled to balance my own stress with supporting her, and on top of that, my family (who can be difficult to get to know) had a hard time connecting with her. This put me in the middle, adding to the pressure.

At some point, I started to feel uncertain about the relationship, but it didn’t feel like I could bring it up. I told myself I’d wait until she had actually joined the military before considering a breakup—so that she’d have stability—but in hindsight, that wasn’t the healthiest way to approach things.
More than seven months passed, and she still hadn’t gotten in. My friends and family (who initially liked her) were telling me I should leave after hearing about the money situation. I wasn’t sure what to do.

Last Tuesday, we had a conversation about our relationship. She came into it apologizing for being a bad partner and wanting to work on things. I went into it feeling like I might want to break up—but I wasn’t entirely sure. We ended up agreeing to take a one-week break with zero contact to process things.

Over the course of the week, I realized that I do want to be with her. I love her, I want to work on things, and I regret not opening up to her about my own struggles. I reached out three days before the break ended to tell her this and asked when we’d meet up—but she didn’t reply. I messaged again the day before the break ended, and she finally responded after midnight, but her response was cold. It felt like she had already checked out of the relationship, and now I’m afraid that she no longer wants to be with me.

She asked to meet this Thursday at a coffee shop to talk. I’m worried—partly because she didn’t have time to meet sooner (even though I know she doesn’t have much going on) and partly because of her cold response. I feel like she might be planning to break up with me.
I still love her deeply and want to move forward together, but I also recognize that I made mistakes by not being open about my own struggles. At the same time, I’m terrified that I’ve lost her. She is an incredibly funny, beautiful, kind, and artistically talented person, and I feel lucky to have been with her. I just wish I had handled things differently.


I’m preparing myself for a really emotional conversation, and I want to handle it well. I don’t know how to approach it, what to say, or how to express my feelings in the best way. I’ve considered bringing flowers or a small gift, but I don’t know if that’s the right move.
For those who have been through something similar: How do I approach this conversation? What’s the best way to express everything I’m feeling without making things worse?

TL;DR:
Took a one-week break from my girlfriend; realized I want to stay together. She now seems distant and wants to talk Thursday—I’m scared she’ll break up. How do I handle it?",1,1738656301.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Here’s a step-by-step plan that you can follow:

# 1. Set a Clear Goal and Breakdown the Numbers

The first thing you need to do is break down your goal into smaller, actionable steps. $10,000 in 12 months is roughly $833 a month. If that feels too high, break it down further into a weekly savings goal of about $192. This makes the goal feel more achievable and less overwhelming.

# 2. Track Your Spending

Start by tracking every penny you spend. Use apps like Mint or YNAB (You Need A Budget) to categorize your expenses and find where you can cut back. This will give you a clear picture of where your money is going and highlight areas for potential savings.

# 3. Create a Budget

Once you know where your money is going, create a budget. Set limits for essential expenses (rent, utilities, groceries) and try to cut back on non-essentials (dining out, subscriptions, entertainment). Allocate a specific amount for savings each month — and stick to it.

# 4. Find Additional Sources of Income

While cutting expenses is crucial, increasing your income is just as important. Look for side gigs, freelance work, or even sell unused items around your house. Apps like TaskRabbit, Fiverr, or even driving for Uber or DoorDash can be great ways to earn extra cash.

# 5. Automate Your Savings

Set up automatic transfers to a savings account as soon as you get paid. This takes the decision-making out of the equation and helps you stay on track. If you automate $833 each month, you’ll hit your target by the end of the year.

# 6. Cut Back on Luxuries

Do you really need that daily coffee from Starbucks? Could you pack your lunch instead of eating out every day? Small changes like this add up quickly. Try a no-spend challenge for a week or month, and you'll be surprised at how much you can save.

# 7. Sell Unused Items

Go through your closet, garage, and storage. Sell anything you don’t use anymore. Platforms like eBay, Poshmark, or Facebook Marketplace make it easy to sell your unused items and earn some extra cash. You’d be amazed how quickly this can add up.

# 8. Avoid Lifestyle Inflation

As you start saving more money and possibly earning more, it’s tempting to increase your spending. Resist the urge to upgrade your lifestyle, and stay focused on your goal. The more you can avoid lifestyle inflation, the faster you’ll hit your target.

# 9. Take Advantage of Deals and Discounts

Use apps like Honey or Rakuten to find discounts when shopping online. Take advantage of cashback offers, sales, and coupons whenever possible to reduce your overall spending.

# 10. Celebrate Milestones

Hitting smaller savings milestones along the way (e.g., $2,500, $5,000, etc.) will keep you motivated. Treat yourself to a small, affordable reward every time you hit one of these targets to celebrate your progress.

Remember, saving $10,000 in a year is totally doable with a plan. Stay disciplined, track your progress, and focus on your end goal. It might seem challenging, but at the end of the year, you’ll look back and be amazed at what you’ve accomplished.

I 30f have been seeing my bf for 8 months. So far, had 4/5 encounters of dishonesty in the last 4 months. 

First. Let me say that we party. Which hindsight. Is part of this issue. But, I got a bear between us (lol) I will refer it as food so it’s not completely one sided 

First lie was telling me all the ‘coffee’ I bought was gone. I happen to catch a glimpse in the room, asked, straight up caught him, and called him out. He was remorseful and we took a break from the caffeine to bring us back to baseline. 

**Month later. I was out with friends over night. I asked how his night was the next day. He tells me he hung out with a girl I’ve never heard of. Im asking questions due to last month. After, tells me they actually didn’t. It was only said to make me jealous.

Another month later. Lies over coffee yet again. Lies about having a day off to stay up counting on weather. Then ducks himself. Caught him lying to his friend over coffee. Aswell. At this time. I called a small intervention. 

Now. Currently, 2 months from the last. I had gone through medical stuff where I couldn’t have sex for 3 weeks. During this time, he expressed not feeling love without a bj. And I said my love isn’t defined by sex. I then found smut on his phone later that week. That I swear, is his dick. If not- weird to find one very similar. Regardless, something he saved off of Snapchat. 

There’s a lot of stuff missing between. And here’s what I think are notable. I’m older. Patient. Supportive. I recognize his triggers, his bad habits, and his age. Things I’ve gently (not perfectly) left on the table. 

Currently the only rule has been no coffee since lying about work.  Only said yes once for a concert. So he CAN manage without. 

What attracts me to him IS his emotional intelligence. Romantic, kind, very vocal about what bothers him and what he wants. He seems remorseful and cares to change but I’m guarded.

I want to know, how can I forgive and move on? Is this relationship done? Too short to determine if there’s hope? Or a lot in a short period and to run? How much of this is his age? 

Shit. I remember being a jealous, devilish, and rough around then. 25/26/27 being the age where I cut shit out. But did I do that alone or through my partners and support system?

I like to listen to music but in the way where you feel it, you know? I love music that I can feel. I like dogs and cats, any pet really. I’d hug a bear if it didn’t naturally want to maul me. I love meaningful poetry but I also love things that make me laugh. I like to send too many snaps and keep streaks going even though it’s absolutely useless and has no value to it. I like to learn—maybe it’s the pressure? I love the pressure. I like tea just as much as I like coffee. Beaches still amaze me even though I live in California because they are so far from me. 

I like to play games, on my PC and sometimesmy switch. Sometimes I stay up all night talking to my friends around the world on voice chat and that’s perhaps the worst thing I could do as a full-time worker. I do make up as a hobby among many other things. I'm super crafty. I'm currently a Director in marketing.

With every click, every search, every app you use, your data is collected, analyzed, and sold. 😱

But there’s a way to fight back: **VPNs.**

Here’s how a VPN can help:

🔐 **Encrypt Your Data**: With a VPN, your connection is scrambled and encrypted. Anyone trying to spy on you, whether it's hackers or governments, won’t have a chance.

🔍 **Anonymity Online**: Your IP address is hidden, meaning your online activity isn’t tied to you personally. It’s like wearing an invisibility cloak on the internet.

💼 **Protection While Traveling**: If you’ve ever used public Wi-Fi at airports, coffee shops, or hotels, you know how vulnerable your data can be. A VPN makes sure you stay secure no matter where you are.

The question isn’t *if* you should use a VPN, but *when* will you start?

I'm going to New York for the first time in March, and I have an awkward layover time just before I leave the city (international flight)

I come in from Puerto Rico at 6.30am on a Sunday and my next flight is at 1am. I would have already spent 5 days in NYC before this so I don't need to head back to Manhattan. But based on timings (i.e. at airport 3 hours before, 2 hours for security getting out and finding a place to leave luggage), it would give me 12 hours inbetween!

I will most likely chug coffee to keep me awake. My idea was to go into Queens to do some sightseeing... but I've just realised just how HUGE Queens is and that some of the places that seemed cool are closer to Manhattan anyway! 

Basically I am very overwhelmed and don't know much about Queens at all. Would love a suggestion for a place to visit in Queens and maybe good food? (Like the part of Queens closer to JFK, a lot of what I've researched is about Astoria) it'd be great to just walk around a different part of the city,  but i don't even know what a good spot would be to explore especially with relatively limited time. 

Or should I just take the one hour journey each way into Manhattan for one last day in the city? 

Hope this isn't too vague! Budget wise, I'm pretty flexible but after a 2 week vacation and with the weakness of my currency, a cheap eat would not go amiss. Thanks NYC! Super excited to visit it's a dream come true.",3,1738654180.0,AskNYC,4,1.0,False

I'm the middle child and always felt like because my brother and I were close in age and my sister was much younger, I always functioned as an older sister and we were treated more like “twins”. I cooked for my siblings, I was helping both of them with school work because they both had learning disabilities during the time we grow up, and I was extremely happy to take this role because I loved to feel useful and had a good connection with my siblings. Both me and my brother went through a lot of difficulties after graduating high school for different reasons, and we supported each other through them. 3 years ago, my brother met his fiance. We have very different personalities- I am a little absent minded at times and very spontaneous and warm, while she is very organized and a perfectionist to a fault, even if it means she is less nice to other people. I wasn't taking any of our differences personally and I thought of myself as their friend. A year ago, I noticed that her attitude towards me is demeaning- she is acting very often like I'm a child, with a lot of backhanded, implied remarks on the way I dress, the way I choose to get tattoos and sometimes my knowledge about certain subjects or opinions. I love and confident about the way I live my life and I don't feel inferior to her, but the remarks felt very out of place that I decided to not talk to her or share with her anything that is not intended to be civil. A month ago my brother who just moved in with his fiance invited me to his house to hang because we didn't have the chance to talk in a while, and he was at his phone the entire time. I was upset and argued with him after leaving and he explained to me over the phone that he just got a new job and that he will make it up to me. Fast forward today, we met in a coffee shop as a “peace offering” and we had a really good time. I was explaining to him that I was going through a difficult time and I needed his support at the time and he was being supportive. the conversation continued and he asked if I'm in good relationship with his fiance. I was honest with him and told him that like I expressed to him before, I feel like she doesn't respect me and I decided that it's not healthy for me to keep being nice when she is belittling me. 
His reaction to this information was:”have you thought about the fact that you may have given her a reason to act this way? You're acting sometimes really childish next to us…” 
This made me feel completely embarrassed. I told him that I don't think I'm being childish and I just try to light up the mood, and that he does it all the time. I told him that I think that because me and his fiance are the same age, she shouldn't act like I'm a child anyway, even if I have different set of values than her. He then told me: “but you know it's not completely true. We have a relationship for 3 years and we are almost married and we’re at our professional stage of life while your relationship with your partner is very childish and not as serious”. I was extremely flustered by this statement but wasn't thinking too much about it at the time. I got home and was reframing all those events in my head, and I really think that it's not his fiance that is disrespecting me, it's him. And it hurts, especially because I was acting so many times like the oldest sibling when he refused to take responsibility himself, and because I'm extremely accomplished and happy with my achievements. I'm supposed to be a bridesmaid in their wedding, but I honestly don't even wanna communicate with them, I'm disgusted now that I have a reflection of the way they perceive me.

1ihca3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1ihca3h/my_experience_with_3_girls_in_last_12_months/,My experience with 3 girls in last 12 months,"Honey Singh was right: 
Man really predicted the dating scene like a prophet. Let me explain:

So, one day I installed a dating app. Full disclosure—I was looking for a long-term, wholesome relationship. None of that hookup stuff. I matched with a thick curves- pretty girl, Even our names kinda matched and things started off great. We exchanged witty jokes, texted all the time, and one night, we ended up talking till late. The next day, she was a bit tipsy and told me I could ask her anything about her life. Of course, I went for the classic “Tell me about your first time.”

Turns out, she wasn’t a virgin. No biggie. But then she casually mentioned she’d hooked up with two guys before—and oh, also had an ex she was really into. And let me tell you, it wasn’t the ex part that stung. It was the hookup thing. Like, why, Miss ? Anyway, we eventually called it off, because things just weren’t working out (and no, we never even met).

Fast forward, I meet this other girl. Works at an NGO, super smart, beautiful, and hilarious. Our vibe was basically Tom and Jerry—constant banter. One day, she asks if I’ve ever kissed someone. Me? Old-school gentleman here, so nope. Then it’s her turn to share. She starts talking about her recent Goa trip (red flag alert). She installed Bumble while there and matched with a guy. They stayed out late and… yep, they made out. I mean,you just met him! I tried to act unbothered, but it stung, and then she hits me with the cherry on top: “Yeah, the thought of going further did cross my mind.” Ma’am, I didn’t need to know that, this made me feel very crappy, and my heart ached like for a week 💀😂

Anyway, moving on, I started talking to this girl I met through mutual friends in an online game. Things heated up recently,(been talking to each other for a month now)and she asked me to install Snapchat (which I never used, but hey, for her, why not?). We started sharing pictures, had to see how we looked and rated each other so, she sent her picture, turns out she’s a pretty girl with green eyes(Wamiqa Gabbi look alike with green emerald eyes)later she asked me to send her a shirtless pic, as it was night(I sleep shirtless )and had to sent one then, the vibes and mood and (don’t judge—it was accidental. Okay, maybe not,but now I regret for not valuing myself ) and man I’m a bit ripped 🤏 or maybe bit more’, and her reaction? “Are you a virgin?” Bruh. I said yes, and she hits me with, “I don’t believe you—with that face and eyes?”(I have hazel eyes with slight green shade-green part visible rarely )

Now here’s where it gets wild: I ask her if she’s a virgin, and she casually drops this bomb—she hooked up with some guy she barely knew after meeting him once. Not only that, she proudly says she made the first move because, “Guys never say no.” Excuse me, ma’am, what? At this point, I was just sitting there questioning my life decisions.(next day at gym I had to listen to isq-risk and ishq bulaava, to channel all my emotions -energy and range in my workouts while exercising🫡😂)

Finally, let’s talk about my best friend—a woman I consider like a sister. She tells me over coffee one day, “Yeah, casual stuff is pretty common for girls.” And then she drops her life story: After her breakup, she had two “situationships”—one was a hookup, and the other was a trial run for something serious (spoiler: it didn’t work out). She even said she hoped the casual thing would turn into a long-term relationship. Sis, this isn’t Netflix—there’s no “continue watching” button for hookups.

So yeah, moral of the story? It sucks when the girls you’re into don’t value themselves and decide to hook up with strangers. I mean, I get it when it’s an ex—it’s emotional. But a stranger? Feels bad, man, like there’s a knife stabbing me.

Also, shoutout to Honey Singh for seeing the future of dating before anyone else did. “Kuch bhi fresh nahi milega.” Truer words have never been spoken.”

My question is should i give up on my principles of values ,ethics and morality and walk the path of lust as everyone in this generation, Or should I give dating an another shot in this fdup generation?",1,1738653728.0,OffMyChestIndia,6,0.55,False

I used to be a bit overweight (190-200lbs) with total Chol in the 240-280s.

Fast forward to my 40s. I have shed some late baby fat weight and am now 165-170lbs. I exercise 90-150 minutes per week with a combination of weights and cardio. I have to say I am not the most disciplied in the dietary department but I do try to incorporate fiber (oats for breakfast, small salad for lunch, occassional fruit after dinner) into my daily routine.

My blood pressure has been consistently low (110/48), but yet my cholesterol has stubbornly remained high. Some available stats from the last 3 years:

* 2022: total 215, trig 124, HDL 58, LDL 132
* Jan 2024: total 260, trig 102, HDL 62, LDL 178
* Apr 2024: total 230, trig 99, HDL 53, LDL 157
* Oct 2024: total 275, trig 113, HDL 63, LDL 189
* Feb 2025: total 302, trig 115, HDL 68, LDL **210!**

The latest numbers are a record high and have really shocked me because I think since the previous high numbers from Oct'24, I have done a pretty good job of avoiding red meat as much as I can and sticking to chicken and eggs as my main source of protein. Additional info, I drink 3 cups of black coffee and take fish oil (980/1400mg of Omega-3) on a daily basis.

My family has a history of high cholesterol. My mother is skinny but got hers under control through statin. Should I get tested for FH or other familial lipid disorders?

1ihc5ke,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Shreyas_crazy/comments/1ihc5ke/s/,s,"The sound of rhythmic creaking from the upstairs bedroom caught Haruto’s attention. He paused mid-step, the glass of water in his hand forgotten. That’s not the usual noise, he thought, his curiosity piqued. The faint, muffled grunts were unmistakable—his son, Ren, was up to something. Haruto crept up the stairs, his bare feet silent on the carpeted steps, and pressed his ear against Ren’s door. The low, throaty moans confirmed it. He’s jerking off, Haruto realized, a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.



But then he heard it—Ren’s breathless whisper, barely audible through the door. “Fuck, Mom… so fucking hot…”



Haruto’s heart skipped a beat. Mom? He’s fantasizing about his own mother? A strange mix of shock and arousal surged through him. He leaned closer, his cock twitching in his boxers as Ren’s moans grew louder. “Yeah, fuck me, Mom… take me… I need you…”



Haruto’s mind raced. This is wrong. So wrong. But… He couldn’t deny the heat pooling in his groin. He’d always had a thing for voyeurism, but this was something else entirely. The thought of his wife, Aiko, being the object of their son’s lust—it was taboo, forbidden, and yet… His hand instinctively drifted to his hardening shaft. He couldn’t help himself.



The next morning, Haruto sat at the kitchen table, his coffee untouched. Aiko bustled around the kitchen, oblivious to the storm brewing in her husband’s mind. Ren wandered in, still groggy from sleep. “Morning,” he mumbled, grabbing a bowl of cereal.



Haruto cleared his throat. “We need to talk. Both of you.”



Aiko paused, her brow furrowing. “What’s going on, Haruto?”



Ren froze, his spoon hovering mid-air.



Haruto leaned forward, his gaze intense. “I heard something last night. Something… interesting.”



Aiko’s eyes narrowed. “Go on.”



Haruto took a deep breath. “Ren, I know you’ve been fantasizing about your mother.”



Ren’s face turned crimson, his spoon clattering into the bowl. “Dad, I—”



Aiko’s hand flew to her mouth, her eyes wide with horror. “Haruto, what are you saying?!”



Haruto held up a hand, silencing them. “Hear me out. I’m not angry. In fact… I’m intrigued. I want to see it. I want to watch the two of you together.”



Aiko’s jaw dropped. “Haruto! Have you lost your mind?!”



Ren stared at his father in disbelief. “Dad… are you serious?”



Haruto nodded, his expression deadly serious. “Deadly. Aiko, I know this is… unconventional. But we’ve been married for years. We’ve shared everything. Why not this? Why not let Ren explore his desires? Why not let me enjoy the show?”



Aiko’s face was a mask of shock and disgust. “This is wrong, Haruto! He’s our son!”



Haruto’s eyes hardened. “Aiko, don’t make this harder than it needs to be. You’re going to do this. For me. For Ren.”



Aiko shook her head, tears welling up in her eyes. “No! I won’t!”



Haruto’s lips twisted into a cruel smile. “Oh, you will. Ren, go to your room. Aiko, you’re coming with me.”



Aiko tried to resist, but Haruto’s grip on her arm was ironclad. He dragged her to their bedroom, slamming the door behind them. “Haruto, please! Don’t do this!”



Haruto shoved her onto the bed, his eyes blazing with determination. “You’re going to learn to enjoy this, Aiko. Even if I have to train you.”



Aiko’s protests were cut short as Haruto’s lips crashed onto hers, his tongue forcing its way into her mouth. She struggled, but he held her down, his hands roaming over her body. “Haruto! Stop!”



Haruto pulled back, his breathing heavy. “No, Aiko. You’re going to submit. You’re going to do this for Ren.”



Aiko’s tears streamed down her face as Haruto began to undress her, his movements methodical and unyielding. “You’re going to be his. Completely and utterly his.”



As Haruto’s hands explored her body, Aiko’s resistance began to falter. Her protests turned into muffled moans as he expertly manipulated her most sensitive areas. “That’s it, Aiko. Give in to it. Let yourself feel the pleasure.”



Aiko’s body betrayed her, her moans growing louder as Haruto’s fingers worked their magic. “Haruto, please… I can’t…”



Haruto smirked, knowing he was winning. “Yes, you can. And you will. For Ren.”



By the time Haruto was done with her, Aiko was a trembling, aroused mess. Her body was on fire, her mind clouded with desire. “Haruto… what have you done to me?”



Haruto kissed her deeply, his voice filled with dark promise. “I’ve only just begun, Aiko. Ren is next. And you’re going to love every second of it.”



Haruto led Aiko back to Ren’s room, her body still humming with desire. Ren looked up, his eyes wide with a mix of fear and arousal. “Dad… is she…?”



Haruto nodded, a wicked grin spreading across his face. “She’s ready, Ren. It’s time for you to claim her.”



Aiko’s breath hitched as Ren approached, his eyes filled with lust. “Mom… I’ve wanted this for so long…”



Aiko’s heart raced, her body betraying her once again. “Ren… I…”



Haruto pushed her forward, his voice a harsh whisper. “Do it, Aiko. Let him take you.”



Ren’s hands trembled as he reached out, cupping Aiko’s face. “Mom… please…”



Aiko’s eyes closed, a single tear sliding down her cheek as she nodded. “Yes, Ren… take me.”



Aiko’s breath hitched as Ren’s hands slid down her body, his touch both tentative and hungry. She could feel the heat radiating from him, the raw need driving him forward. Her mind screamed that this was wrong, so wrong, but her body was betraying her, every nerve alight with a forbidden desire she couldn’t suppress. Ren’s lips brushed against her neck, sending a shiver down her spine, and she let out a soft, involuntary moan.



“Ren… we shouldn’t…” she whispered, though her voice was weak, trembling with the weight of her own arousal.



“Mom,” Ren murmured, his voice thick with desperation as his hands gripped her hips. “I’ve wanted this for so long. Please… let me have you.”



Aiko’s eyes flicked to Haruto, who was leaning against the wall, watching them with an intensity that made her stomach twist. His gaze was dark, predatory, and it sent a thrill through her that she hated to admit. He nodded, his voice low and commanding. “Give him what he wants, Aiko. Let him take you.”



Her heart pounded as Ren’s hands moved to the hem of her shirt, lifting it slowly over her head. The cool air hit her skin, making her nipples harden instantly. Ren’s breath caught at the sight, his hands trembling as he reached out to touch her. His fingers brushed against her breasts, and Aiko let out a gasp, her head falling back.



“You’re so beautiful, Mom,” Ren whispered, his voice filled with awe and lust. He leaned in, capturing one of her nipples in his mouth, and Aiko moaned, her hands instinctively tangling in his hair. His tongue flicked against her nipple, teasing and sucking, and she felt her knees weaken.



“Oh God… Ren…” she moaned, her body arching into his touch. The guilt was still there, lingering at the edges of her mind, but it was drowned out by the overwhelming pleasure coursing through her.



Ren’s hands moved to her waist, undoing the button of her jeans and sliding them down her legs. Aiko stepped out of them, now completely exposed to her son. His eyes raked over her body, drinking in every curve, every inch of her. He reached out, his fingers brushing against her inner thigh, and Aiko’s breath hitched.



“Please…” she whispered, her voice barely audible.



Ren didn’t need to be told twice. He knelt before her, his hands spreading her legs apart, and Aiko’s heart raced as she realized what he was about to do. His breath was hot against her skin, and then his tongue was on her, licking and teasing her most intimate place. Aiko’s hands flew to his shoulders, her nails digging into his skin as a moan escaped her lips.



“Oh… oh God… Ren…” she cried out, her hips rocking against his face as he worked her with his tongue. The pleasure was overwhelming, her body trembling with every flick of his tongue.



Haruto watched from the corner, his hand moving slowly over his own arousal as he took in the sight before him. His wife and son, entangled in a way that was both forbidden and intoxicating. The sounds of Aiko’s moans filled the room, and Haruto felt a surge of satisfaction. This was what he had wanted, what he had craved—the thrill of watching, of being the one to orchestrate this dangerous game.



Ren’s hands gripped Aiko’s thighs, holding her steady as he devoured her. Aiko’s moans grew louder, her body writhing with pleasure as he brought her closer and closer to the edge. When she finally came, her body convulsing with the force of her orgasm, Ren didn’t stop. He kept going, his tongue relentless, and Aiko cried out, her hands gripping his hair.



“Ren… stop… I can’t… oh God…” she begged, but he didn’t listen, pushing her through another wave of pleasure until she was trembling, her legs barely able to hold her up.



Ren stood, his eyes burning with desire as he looked at her. “I need you, Mom,” he said, his voice rough. “I need to be inside you.”



Aiko’s heart raced as she looked at him, her body still trembling from the aftershocks of her orgasm. She wanted to say no, to push him away, but the words wouldn’t come. Instead, she nodded, her voice barely a whisper. “Yes… take me, Ren…”



Ren didn’t hesitate. He grabbed her, lifting her up and carrying her to the bed. He laid her down gently, his eyes never leaving hers as he positioned himself between her legs. Aiko’s breath hitched as she felt the tip of his arousal pressing against her, and she closed her eyes, bracing herself.



“Ren… wait…” she whispered, but he was already pushing into her, and Aiko let out a gasp as he filled her completely.



“Mom… you feel so good…” Ren groaned, his hands gripping her hips as he started to move.



Aiko’s body responded instantly, her hips rocking against his as he thrust into her. The pleasure was unlike anything she had ever felt, her mind overwhelmed by the sensation of her son inside her. Her moans filled the room, mingling with Ren’s groans as they moved together.



“Oh… Ren… yes…” she cried out, her nails digging into his back as he pounded into her. The bed creaked with their movements, the sound of skin slapping against skin filling the room.



Haruto watched, his hand moving furiously over his own arousal as he took in the sight of his wife and son. The sight of Aiko’s body writhing with pleasure, of Ren’s muscles straining as he thrust into her—it was everything he had ever wanted. He felt a surge of jealousy, of possessiveness, but it was overshadowed by the sheer thrill of watching them.



“Fuck her, Ren,” Haruto said, his voice rough. “Make her yours.”



Ren growled, his thrusts becoming more intense, more primal. Aiko cried out, her body arching as he hit a spot inside her that made her see stars.



“Oh God… Ren… I’m… I’m going to…” she moaned, her body trembling as she felt another orgasm building.



“Come for me, Mom,” Ren whispered, his breath hot against her ear. “Let me feel you.”



Aiko’s orgasm hit her hard, her body convulsing as she screamed out his name. Ren groaned, his own release following as he spilled himself inside her.



Haruto’s hand moved faster, his own orgasm building as he watched them. The sight of his wife and son, lost in their passion, was enough to push him over the edge.



“Fuck… Aiko…” he groaned, his release hitting him as he watched her moan in ecstasy.



Aiko’s body was still trembling as Ren collapsed on top of her, his breath hot against her skin. She could feel him, inside her, and a wave of guilt washed over her, but it was fleeting, drowned out by the afterglow of her pleasure.



“Mom…” Ren whispered, his voice soft. “That was… amazing.”



Aiko’s heart ached as she looked at him, her son, her baby, and she reached up, brushing a strand of hair from his face. “Ren… we can’t… this can’t happen again…”



But even as she said the words, she knew they were a lie. Her body was already craving more, the heat between her legs proof of her insatiable desire.



Ren leaned in, capturing her lips in a kiss that was both tender and possessive. “I love you, Mom,” he murmured. “I’ll always love you.”",1,1738653170.0,u_Shreyas_crazy,1,1.0,False

Hi, late-20’s M here. Reposting this because I’m looking for penpals wishing to communicate through the reddit DM’s for now and eventually through the classic penpaling experience, Snail Mail, if we find our vibes match. 

My time is usually spent as follows: podcasts, history, comedy, movies, music, traveling, coffee, languages, books, current events or just talking about the weather and other topics, so please reach out! 

I also enjoy the world of light-capture (photography) a lot, so you can expect me to talk about and share photography often. Once I get into film-reel-photography, I’d love to include prints in the future snail mail letters, think of them as postcards especially the travel-related content. 

If none of these topics are your thing and your interests are completely different, I’d still love to hear from you. 

Penpaling is a creative exchange, and I enjoy learning about perspectives and pursuits outside my own world.

Look forward to hearing from you. ",1,1738653078.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

Non english speaker here, so expect all kinds of grammatical and spelling mistakes. Also this post is unedited.

I was casually making scenarios my head and then casually made this one and immediately ran here to ask for recs.

We have our MC1 who is a widower, their partner/spouse died and they're trying to live their life.

They're not necessarily against dating cause he's sworn off love, but they don't see a point cause the love of their life is dead.

Through some seres of events, they fall in love with MC2 and they live happily ever after.

MC2 can be a friend who has been yearning for the MC1, he can be a total stranger MC1 meets in a coffee shop or some other place, he can be a friend of a friend, he can be MC1's kid's teacher, they can even be rivals or enemies...

You get the gist...

The widow MC could've been a widow for a while now.

I literally read anything, except Age play.

I know it's kinda a common trope but please indulge me.

Bonus point 1 : Bi Awakening on the widow's journey or him being a Bi man who was married to a woman.

Bonus point 2: not necessary  but i prefer my MCs to be Masc and over 25, i want comolete adults. But i absolutely read young adult  books or college aged characters or flamboyant MCs.


Bonus point 3: net necessary either but i would also prefer a strict Top/Bottom dynamic. With the widow being the top. Vers couples are also absolutely fine.

Bonus point 4: widow being a single dad, again, not necessary, but i would love to read about a single dad finding love again.

These are some of the books I've read with almost all the bonus points.

One stares at the other, the other turns and catches their eye, they quickly look away and pretend they weren’t.

The same seats every day, busy, quiet, always just a few rows apart, always in view of the other, always noticing when routines change.

How do they first meet? Is someone else sat in their regular seat, do they clash on the platform, do they suddenly meet in a work environment?

Maybe they’re both married, maybe it’s an affair, or two younger professionals with their minds set on work, always looking up from their laptops wishing that they had the courage to say “could I buy you a coffee?”

Maybe a cancelled train leads to a shared taxi because one of them “notices you get off at the same stop as me”

To really spice it up, maybe the others partner is on the train one morning alerting the other to the illicit nature of their desire.

Maybe a long absence ensues and it’s only on the return to work, when one thought they’d missed their opportunity forever, that they spark into action.

He's a cis man. We always talk about other hot cis man that we saw at the gym, big muscles, buldge etc. But when it comes to him talking that way about a trans person it feels weird. We also used to sleep together, so it makes me question on how he sees me as well. Overall the conversation makes me feel icky and I'm not sure if I am reading it the wrong way.

So I thought I’d share how I’ve done it in the past—especially when I was running social with zero resources. This approach worked pretty well, helped me stay consistent, and was easy to scale as things grew.

# Keep It Simple: Set Up a Spreadsheet

I use a Google Sheet. **One spreadsheet per quarter, one tab per month.** This will help you from scrambling last minute, but it’s flexible enough to tweak things as you go.

# Start with Key Dates

Before thinking about content, **mark down all important dates**—product launches, industry events, relevant holidays (even the fun ones like *National Coffee Day* ☕). These give you easy content prompts right away.

# Be Realistic About What You Can Post

**Don't overcommit.** Start with a goal of posting thice/week. Scale if you can. Also, if you can’t shoot videos every week, don’t stress about it. **Pick content formats that work for you**—single images, carousels, infographics, testimonials, whatever’s doable.

# Don’t Just Sell—Give People a Reason to Follow You

This is SOO important. MIX UP YOUR CONTENT. For example, I followed this for one of my clients:  
📅 **Tuesdays:** Industry insights  
📅 **Thursdays:** Product-related content  
📅 **Fridays:** Customer stories or behind-the-scenes

The goal is to be valuable, not just visible.

# Create Templates for Repeat Content

If you’re gonna post something regularly (like testimonials or FAQs), **make a simple Canva template** so you’re not reinventing the wheel every time.

Nothing will be perfect right away, and that’s fine. **Post, see what works, adjust.** Pay attention to engagement, and if something flops, move on. The best content strategy is the one you can *actually* stick to.",2,1738652662.0,0to1marketing,0,1.0,False

The problem is - I have tried a bunch and have literally only ever liked Tana French. I stan her but I've read all her books like four times and it's getting a bit embarrassing. Can anyone suggest something similar I might like? 

I'm not very literate in the tropes or styles of the mystery genre, but I think what I like about Tana French's novels is what I would call the police procedural aspect? I like the interrogations that go on for dozens of pages, and the detailed autopsies, and pulling phone records and looking at texts for another dozen pages. When I google ""novels like Dublin Murder Squad"", mostly comparisons come up about, like, atmosphere or themes or writing style - which is all great and which I also like, but what I really want is that plus a riveting three-chapter-long conversation where the crime scene tech is saying exactly which kind of fibre was found on the coffee table or whatever.

I've tried Val McDermid and Dervla McTiernan and a bunch of other random stuff out of my library that didn't really scratch the itch. Can anyone help me? I just started The Secret Place again and I think I'm going to go insane. ",2,1738652599.0,mysterybooks,0,1.0,False

I have been lurking in this sub for quite sometime, and I am ready to buy a new setup (grinder + machine). 

A bit of background: 
I owned a super automatic machine for a few years and I loved it, until I got into better and better beans (traditional and light roast). About a year ago my machine stopped working (it still steams milk but the built in grinder died).

Now, I mainly use a mekineta and a V60, and buy my morning cappuccino out.

I usually drink about large milk drink in the morning (triple shot + 200 ml of milk), and 2 decaf/caffeinated espresso or americano during the day (I might swap one of them with a V60). When I had the machine, I often used to make my partner a cappuccino or a latte alongside my coffee. 

I am looking for a grinder and a machine for about $2,500 (both).

Key features: sturdy and long lasting, not too big, fast-ish (20min +-) heat up time.

What do you suggest and why?

P.S. - I live in the U.S.

But there's still lots of procrastination, there's still things I feel my ADHD prevents me from doing. But I think I did it. I think I cracked the code. 

For example, I wanna go to the gym and I also wanna read. 

It's hard for me to get up, get out and go to the gym. It's just not a fun-promising activity, or at least not enough to get me going. (The kind where you WANT to work out, you just don't want to GO to work out, once I'm at the gym it's all good) 

Reading is also not fun enough to seek the activity out by itself. I just don't have enough focus to sit in my flat, with all the distractions in the world, and actually read for half an hour. 

Here's where it gets interesting, I just combined both. The gym is now a place where I go on the stairmaster for 30-50 minutes and read. Both activities take some concentration and focus, and while I can focus on my book 60% more than while idle, I kind of forget that I'm working out. No more impulsive ""okay, that's enough, I don't wanna work out anymore"". 

Another thing is, that after waking up I really enjoy going for early morning walks. But I also really like having my morning coffee hot. So I waste 20 minutes that I want to walk hurrying down my coffee. 

So that, I also combined. I got myself a reusable takeaway coffee cup and just sip it on my walk. 

I'm writing a novel (by hand) but I always find better things to do that are more stimulating. I also take the bus to uni (45min ride) nearly every day. On the bus I have enough autonomy to write, but not enough to do anything more fun. So every time I take the bus, I dedicate the time working on my novel.

I want to walk more, like just going for walks, but often that in itself gets boring after some time. So now I just arrange calls with friends or family and then, when they call, go for a walk until the call is over.  

This is all I could implement as of now, but I'm very excited about the idea. It's not just that I actually get things done, it's also that I don't have to dedicate extra time. 

Do you have systems like this in place? I'd like to apply this to more things in my life as it just works like a charm for me!! Please let me know.

# Introduction

Feeling sluggish, drained, or like your energy is running on fumes? You're not alone. Many men struggle with **blood circulation issues**, leading to fatigue, lower endurance, and a general lack of oomph. It’s frustrating, especially when even a strong cup of coffee barely makes a dent.

[Tupi Tea](https://theworldhealth.org/tupi-tea-official) claims to offer a **natural remedy for improved blood flow**, using a mix of herbs designed to support stamina and circulation.

But does it actually work, or is it another expensive addition to the kitchen shelf of forgotten supplements? Let’s dig in.

# Product Overview

* **Product Name: Tupi Tea**
* **Category: Men's Health Herbal Supplements**
* **Overall Verdict: 4.7/5**

# How Tupi Tea Works

Unlike many supplements that focus solely on **boosting nitric oxide**, Tupi Tea claims to support **endothelial health**, which plays a key role in **circulatory function**.

If your endothelium isn’t functioning properly, blood flow slows down, which affects **energy levels, stamina, and overall vitality**.

By using **herbal supplements for men's health**, Tupi Tea aims to help **improve blood flow naturally** and ensure that oxygen and nutrients reach where they need to go.

Instead of relying on synthetic ingredients, this formula uses **natural circulation support supplements** that have been trusted for centuries.

# Key Ingredients and Their Benefits

Tupi Tea is packed with **herbal solutions for** [better circulation](https://theworldhealth.org/tupi-tea-official), each chosen for its potential effect on **vascular health**. Here’s a look at the key players:

* **Horny Goat Weed** – Commonly found in **herbal supplements for blood circulation**, this plant is believed to help with stamina and **nitric oxide production**.

🍁

* **Muira Puama** – Used for centuries to support **energy and circulatory function**, it's a well-known part of **herbal remedies for circulation issues**.

🍁

* **Tribulus Terrestris** – Often seen in **herbal teas for blood flow**, this ingredient may help **increase circulation and stamina**.

🍁

* **Ginkgo Biloba** – A widely studied **natural blood flow enhancer**, it’s thought to **improve vascular function** and **reduce oxidative stress**.

🍁

* **Turnera Diffusa (Damiana Leaf)** – Found in **natural supplements for vascular health**, this herb is used for **supporting circulation and overall vitality**.

These ingredients work together to offer **natural ways to boost blood flow**, supporting endurance and circulation without synthetic additives.

# Davide's Personal Experience with Tupi Tea

Davide, the guy who runs my local gym, is one of those people who seems to run on an endless supply of energy.

He’s up before sunrise, coaching clients, lifting weights, and somehow still has enough left in the tank for his own training.

But even he admits that as the years go by, **maintaining stamina and endurance takes a little extra effort**.

He [gave Tupi Tea a shot](https://theworldhealth.org/tupi-tea-official) after hearing some of his gym members talk about **herbal solutions for better circulation**. His first impression? The taste was… well, *earthy*.

But as someone who’s knocked back his fair share of chalky protein shakes and questionable pre-workouts, he wasn’t too fazed.

After two weeks, he started noticing **a steady boost in energy levels**—not the jittery kind, just a feeling of being more *switched on*.

His workouts felt a little smoother, and he wasn’t as wiped out by the end of a long day. The only downside? He did mention that on an empty stomach, the tea made him feel slightly queasy, so he made a habit of drinking it after breakfast.

His verdict? **A solid addition for anyone looking to naturally support stamina and circulation**—but maybe don’t chug it first thing in the morning.

# Tupi Tea Customer Feedback

Looking at **Tupi Tea customer feedback**, the majority of users report **positive effects on energy levels and endurance**. Many say they feel **less fatigued, more active, and generally “lighter”** after using it consistently.

Some users mentioned they needed **at least three weeks to notice a difference**, which makes sense since **natural blood flow enhancers** typically take time to build up in the system.

Negative reviews mostly focus on **taste preferences** and the fact that results aren’t immediate. If you’re after an instant effect, this may not be for you.

# Tupi Tea Side Effects

Like any supplement, **Tupi Tea side effects** can vary by person. Most users don’t report any issues, but some experience **mild stomach discomfort**—especially when taken on an empty stomach.

**Ginkgo Biloba**, one of the ingredients, can occasionally cause **dizziness or headaches** in people sensitive to it. If you’re on blood thinners or have circulatory conditions, it’s best to check with a healthcare provider before using this.

# Comparison with Other Circulation Supplements

Most **supplements to enhance circulation** rely on **arginine-based formulas**, which provide a quick boost but don’t necessarily support **long-term vascular health**.

Tupi Tea, however, is built around **herbal products for** [**improved circulation**](https://theworldhealth.org/tupi-tea-official), focusing on **endothelial function** rather than a temporary increase in nitric oxide. That makes it a **better choice for sustained results**, rather than a short-lived energy spike.

# Pros and Cons

# Pros

✅ **Packed with herbal supplements for blood circulation**, avoiding synthetic ingredients.  
✅ **Long-term vascular support**, rather than just a temporary nitric oxide boost.  
✅ **Backed by Tupi Tea user experiences**, with most reporting **better endurance and stamina**.  
✅ **Natural formulation**, with no caffeine or stimulants.

# Cons

❌ **Taste is earthy**, which may not appeal to everyone.  
❌ **Takes time to work**, requiring consistent use.

# Pricing Options

* **1 Jar** – $79 + shipping
* **3 Jars** – $59 per jar (Free U.S. shipping)
* **6 Jars** – $49 per jar (Free U.S. shipping)

Since **herbal teas for blood flow** often take time to work, the **bulk options** provide **better value per jar**. Plus, there’s a **90-day money-back guarantee**, so there’s little risk in giving it a try.

# Where to Buy Tupi Tea

For those interested, [the official website is the best place to buy](https://theworldhealth.org/tupi-tea-official). Some third-party sellers may offer **cheaper versions**, but these could be **counterfeit or lower-quality formulas**.

Only purchases made through the **official site** come with the **money-back guarantee**, so it’s the safest option. **Scam websites exist**, and with the demand for **natural circulation support supplements**, it’s worth sticking with the trusted source.

# Final Thoughts

Tupi Tea is **a solid pick for men looking to improve endurance and circulation naturally**. The **quality ingredients, positive Tupi Tea benefits, and strong user experiences** make it **a worthwhile option for long-term vascular support**.

That said, **don’t expect overnight results**. This isn’t a stimulant, and it takes time to work. But for those willing to **stick with it**, the benefits seem to be real.

Take my father and I for exemple, how can we be so different ? We share the same illness, been through years in hell but when it comes to drugs, cigarettes and even mundane stuff like coffee he just cannot stop, the apparent damages changes nothing.

On the other hand I always managed to rationalize my use, to keep the doses low even at times where I just couldn’t live without it, drugs, sex I suppose, are fun but using them heavily on a daily basis as a crutch clearly isn’t. There I’m not talking about addiction but the immediate side effects, the routines, which are on their own a massive pain in the butt.

From the outside it look like those guys are filling a bottomless void, doing it over and over to maybe dull a pain that will always be there no matter the level of inebriation while not giving a shit about the things and the people they break in the meantime. They are actively determined to do this choice by their remorses, their traumas, their brain chemistry, personality disorders, existential dread, maybe hedonism and so on…

1ihbt5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1ihbt5e/seeking_guidance/,Seeking Guidance,"I’ve debated making this post for a while because most of this thread terrifies me, but I do feel like I’m at a crossroads…

My profile:
- 24, male
- Active, healthy diet, etc.
- No history of gut or digestive issues 
- Based in the US

During the first week of August in 2024, I started having minor bloating. I found it strange, but assumed it was stress or eating habits. I went to Europe for the rest of the month and experienced major bloating like I never have before…I found that strange because traveling usually has the opposite effect for me. No matter what I ate, be it a banana or a croissant, I would balloon up. It was terrifying, but there were no other symptoms. 

Upon returning to the States in September, my PCP immediately suggested I get tested for H. Pylori. UBT came back positive (sigh) and thus the saga begins…Below is everything from then until now:

1. H. Pylori treatment was fine…great even. Bowel movements continued to remain normal, with the exception of solid, occasionally floating stools due to me increasing my fiber intake. I cut out all coffee, acid, spice, etc., took Culturelle probiotic, and ate low FODMAP for the duration of the treatment. My bloating lessened, and I had no antibiotic side effects. Yay.

2. Treatment concluded, and I was re-tested 3-4 weeks later in October. Negative. Yay. I felt great. My bloating kept lessening to the point that I finally felt normal again. 

3. At the end of October, I get an upper respiratory virus (probably COVID)…I also start going through a very stressful time personally. I’m not eating to sleeping well, and I experience a few days of constipation for the first time coupled with minor bloating. I freak out and see my PCP. He listens to my abdomen and says everything “sounds” normal (I.E. No excess gas) — He diagnoses me with stress (true) and tells me to take a probiotic again. I do, and it helps.

4. It’s November. My bowel movements normalize, but I start having abdominal pain after meals. It’s not severe, and it varies in location. This is an extreme period of personal stress for me. My PCP leaves the country, so I see three new doctors — All of them conclude that it’s excess gas bouncing around my colon. To be safe, they run testing:

*H. Pylori UBT: Negative, again.
*O&P Stool Culture: No red flags, including no signs of inflammation. 

5. December. The pain lessens but continues, so I see 2 GI doctors. The first one runs more testing:

* Celiac: Negative
* Blood: All good except for my iron levels. Via ChatGPT: “Your iron studies indicate low iron stores, as shown by low ferritin (12 ng/mL) and iron saturation (12%), with a normal iron level at the lower end of the range (51 µg/dL). This suggests iron deficiency, despite a total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) at the upper limit, which is consistent with your body attempting to compensate for the deficiency”

The doctor that ran my testing assured me that I do not have SIBO, and that my low iron might be due to H. Pylori / whatever illness I got after. Also, I’ve never had bloodwork done before — I have no benchmark for this result, and could’ve always been iron deficient.

The second GI doctor listened more closely to my concerns, though he also did not push SIBO testing. He found my iron levels curious and offered me the test if I wanted it, but did not adamantly say I needed it.

6. I decide not to test because I was leaving for the month again the next day. I go back to Europe for work and felt great. Normal bowel movements, NO bloating, etc…Yay.

7. It’s January. I return to the US and have a busy and stressful few weeks. I’m eating maybe 1-2 meals a day with an erratic sleep schedule, and drinking often due to social commitments. Minor to mild bloating returns, and my stools range from constipation to solid to watery to loose. The abdominal pain does not return.

8. I get my act together circa last week…Fiber, meal-prepping, etc…My stools return back to normal — They do float sometimes, but they’re not greasy or pale. I remain regular, and the bloating lessens. 

I’m not sure where to go from here. I hope that the answer is as simple as getting my act together and taking care of myself again…I’m deeply terrified of SIBO, and I feel uneasy about testing given what I’ve read about false positives.

Other misc. things:
* No brittle nails, acne, red eyes, etc. 
* I feel like I’ve been experiencing hair loss from December to January, but I also assume that can be attributed to the not taking care of myself piece…
* My weight has remained the exact same since October

1ihbsgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlusSize/comments/1ihbsgr/i_was_shamed_for_not_being_plussized_enough/,I was shamed for not being “plus-sized enough”,"This happened a few years back when I first was getting into fashion. I made a group of online friends that were plus sized and we connected on our love for inclusive fashion. 

After a few years into our online friendship we met up because we loved in the same state. To preface, we followed each other on every social media and knew what we looked like before meeting.

I’m no delicate flower. I’m 5’4 and 260. These girls were almost 100 to 200 pounds heavier than me. Which I didn’t give a fuck about. And they were gorgeous as well. One of them was even a professional model. 

Since I first stepped foot into that coffee shop I knew that something was off. Instead of them greeting me they just stared at me for a solid 20 seconds and greeted me like a complete stranger. And these people even fell asleep on the phone with me and helped me get over a cruel breakup. So this behavior was uncalled for.

I took that first interaction lightly because talking to people online is completely different than in person and some nervousness is natural. But this behavior kept on going, and I’m mad at myself for even having this go on for so long. Back then I was insecure still and needed friends, so I let so much stuff pass by without correction.

Every time we met up it was something! From the way I spoke to the way I dressed. There was a problem and it was always me in the center of it.

I really never would have believed that me being “smaller” than them would make it such a problem. 
These girls literally made me feel like an outsider and got angry when I spoke out about my fatness. Every time I shared a problem I’ve had that has been  because of my weight I got responses like:

“Well you can never put yourself in my shoes.”
“At least you have it easier.”
“You are really exaggerating.”

And the biggest one was when I would have men come up and talk to me at bars. These girls would give me the dirtiest looks, like I was some whore. And I have one of them cry and scream at me in the bathroom because I “stole” the guy she wanted. And mind you I never heard she was looking at any guy that night! She was drinking and dancing with another group of girls when she saw his guy come up to me. 

She never saw him until she looked at the table I was sitting at with the other fat girls. I literally left my favorite jacket and stormed off. I block everything and everyone I knew from that group. They tried contacting me against via other friends and I completely ignored them. And I moved states for a job so I never got to see them again thank God.

It’s always like a form of skinny privilege between fat people. Like smaller fat people are not view as plus sized if they don’t fall into certain categories. And since hanging out with plus sized people I’ve felt this more than ever compared to thin people. I don’t know if it’s internalized hate for thinner people or the envy of being smaller, but this shit truly is fucked up! I’m not better than you for being smaller

First, it was all about the kid, (SD5) I had a lot of therapy work to embrace being a step mom I’ve come a LONG WAY and now he's completely consumed by his work (his new business) It feels like there’s no life outside of his kid and his job/business. When I try to get us some date nights, I have to fight for them, and when he finally agrees, it’s like a token effort. I don’t know what to do anymore.

He said if I want to spend time with him, I need to wake up at 6 AM for coffee from 6 to 7 before he takes his daughter to school and then works all day. But it’s not even a typical work schedule—he works every day, Monday through Sunday, with no breaks. No weekends like normal married couples get.. he spends sat nights traveling 2+ hours taking SD to her moms and Sundays traveling another 2+ hours (bio mom gets her weekends and we have her for school mostly full time) rest of the time he works on his business …It feels like he just wants to work until he burns out and never actually enjoys life. He wasn’t like this before we got married, but now it’s like things have totally shifted, and I’m lost. He TRIES a date night here and there but it’s not enough for me… we just got married…. IS THIS WHAT MARRIED LIFE IS?!!

When I talk about it, he loses it and gets aggressive, and I feel stuck. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m tired of complaining to him about it, doesn’t make me feel attractive anymore and it’s making me hate my new life I LITERALLY just got married a few months ago.

I was sipping my morning coffee, scrolling through Slack messages, when I saw a note from a software engineer friend who read my previous story titled [Asking AI to Find AI Is the Dumbest Thing Humans Have Ever Done](https://medium.com/illumination/asking-ai-to-find-ai-is-the-dumbest-thing-humans-have-ever-done-948ad70ffd1f).

# My cancer story written in 2023 went from 61.6% cancerous to a full-blown 99.8% in 2025 after the metastasis of Copyleaks. Talk about an upgrade — if you can call it that!

A few days ago, CopyLeaks flagged 61.6% of my article as AI-generated, highlighting 29 so-called AI phrases. Annoying, sure, but at least semi-believable in the era of overzealous detection tools.

[My cancer cells story](https://medium.com/health-science/cellular-responses-to-ketosis-can-cancer-cells-listen-and-behave-5ac1370ed82a), clearly and passionately written by my very human elderly hands and polished by younger human editors, and improved by 4 medical doctors, had already been unfairly tainted.

Here is what it said about it before, which I thought caused the rejection of it from the boost nomination in 2023.

Assessment #1 of [**Cellular Responses to Ketosis: Can Cancer Cells Listen and Behave?**](https://medium.com/health-science/cellular-responses-to-ketosis-can-cancer-cells-listen-and-behave-5ac1370ed82a) **by Copyleaks**

But two days ago? The AI decided to rewrite history.

The same article — **unchanged, untouched, exactly as it was** — now had a staggering **90.1%** AI-generated rating with **47 flagged phrases.**

In the span of mere days, CopyLeaks had become more “intelligent,” except its intelligence was as reliable as a magic eight-ball predicting the stock market.

That is not it. It even gets crazier to make me a cyborg now.

Look what happens to the same story written in 2023.

# Copyleaks caught a little cancer of its own… and it’s metastasizing!

So, I logged into Copyleaks, which greeted me with the news of a shiny new version. I thought, ‘Ah, finally! They’ve given it some extra brainpower.’

Fast forward a few hours, and what happens?

The same story — my cancer tale — comes back with a twist.

Copyleaks caught a little *cancer* of its own… and it’s **metastasizing!**

Assessment #3 of [**Cellular Responses to Ketosis: Can Cancer Cells Listen and Behave?**](https://medium.com/health-science/cellular-responses-to-ketosis-can-cancer-cells-listen-and-behave-5ac1370ed82a) **by Copyleaks**

# The Evolution of AI-Detection Stupidity

Let’s pause and consider what just happened.

A tool designed to sniff out AI-generated content took the same human-written text and upgraded its “detection.” The AI got “smarter,” but instead of refining its accuracy, it doubled down on its paranoia. Yesterday’s human was today’s machine.

If this were a sci-fi movie, we’d call it **The Algorithmic** [**Gaslight**](https://medium.com/illumination/why-gaslighting-matters-in-the-healthcare-sector-how-to-deal-with-it-effectively-350fa26307a3). What I mean is a horror flick where humans desperately prove their own existence to a machine that insists they’re synthetic.

Imagine turning in a university paper, only to have your professor run it through CopyLeaks on Monday and tell you, “Looks good, mostly human.” Then, on Friday, without a single edit, the same professor accuses you of plagiarism… from yourself.

It would be hilarious if it weren’t so disturbingly real and painful.

But this is no longer hypothetical.

A a fellow writer, [💙Sana M Khan💙](https://medium.com/u/2a261afe638d)’ sister with a PhD degree wrote a scholarly paper and the detection tool said it was written by AI. She left this concerning message [publicly on my Substack post.](https://illumination.substack.com/p/asking-ai-to-find-ai-is-the-dumbest)

If you wan to learn more about the harmful effects of these tools I recommend you a scholarly post by an Academy award-winning computer science professor from UC Berkeley.

[James F. O'Brien](https://medium.com/u/2358c5815f10) published this exceptional story on Towards Data Science with over 700K followers and only myself and Dr Yildiz left a comment and only 9 people clapped it indicating that it is another flagged story. Ironically I found the story on my Substack by coincidence.

[**Accusatory AI: How a Widespread Misuse of AI Technology Is Harming Students**](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/accusatory-ai-how-misuse-of-technology-is-harming-students-56ec50105fe5)

So I invite Brittany Jezouit who is encouraging [scholarly authors to come to Medium](https://medium.com/@healthierlifestyle/i-greatly-admire-rebeccas-work-and-the-poetic-passion-she-brings-to-the-community-5d82356d44da) to give us insights on how Medium algorithm, distribution system, or human curators treat scholarly writers[ as I exemplified in my previous story.](https://medium.com/illumination/asking-ai-to-find-ai-is-the-dumbest-thing-humans-have-ever-done-948ad70ffd1f)

Here is an external perspective to give you an idea on what happened a year ago. I read many more complaints like that. Their claim is inaccurate based on my experience and findings.

[Source from a deleted Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13r4fmz/is_copyleaks_an_reliable_ai_detector/), who knows the deletion reason but I have some ideas

# The Dangerous Domino Effect for Scientists, Leaders, Journalists, Students, and Authors

As a retired scientist, I no longer see this as an inconvenience. I see it as a ticking time bomb. Why?

Because:

AI detection tools are creeping into schools, publishers, and employers, and they’re turning everyone into suspects. Writers, students, and professionals are now at the mercy of fickle, ever-evolving algorithms.

Imagine this:

An author wrongly branded a plagiarist by AI and booted off a platform — gone in a click.

A university expelling a student because their essay suddenly reads ‘too AI,’ even though it’s all their own work.

A journalist’s reputation shattered because an algorithm decided their words were ‘too robotic’ — never mind the years of experience.

And worst of all, a scientist’s groundbreaking paper is tossed aside by a peer-reviewed journal simply because it ‘sounds too perfect’ — thanks to the mighty algorithm.

This is no longer just a glitch. It’s a ticking time bomb, stalling progress and plunging us into chaos.

Innovation is being suffocated, and in its wake, real human suffering is brewing — suffering inflicted upon the very visionaries who are meant to guide us toward a brighter future.

# So, What’s Really Going On?

Either CopyLeaks is refining its software and casting a more exhaustive, sloppier net, or — more likely — it realizes that its previous detection methods were flawed but doesn’t want to admit it.

So instead, it’s doubling down, ensuring more false positives appear more “accurate.” In reality, it’s just flailing.

At this rate, if I resubmit my article in another week, I half expect a flashing red warning:

**“CONGRATULATIONS, YOU ARE NOW 100% AI. PLEASE REPORT TO YOUR NEAREST SERVER FARM.”**

[Here is an assessment of an author](https://medium.com/@EelKat/the-declaration-of-independence-all-books-by-benjamin-franklin-all-stories-and-poems-by-edgar-5d1401463fb6) [Wendy Christine Allen 🌸🦄 aka EelKat 🧿](https://medium.com/u/aba1933ef221) who wrote 138 novels and 423 novellas. She left this comment o[n the recent blog post of Dr Yildiz.](https://medium.com/illumination/quick-update-on-recent-issues-6d979e5ef06a)

# The Final Twist

So here’s the million-dollar question:

If AI detection tools can’t even remain consistent with their own assessments, why should we trust them at all?

It’s one thing to build a system that flags actual AI-written content. It’s another to turn into a digital witch-hunt, branding authors as frauds based on shifting goalposts.

If this is the future of content verification, we’re in trouble.

Because if a human writer can’t prove they’re human, what hope is there for anyone else?

Here’s where things go from ridiculous to downright **unethical**.

AI detection companies don’t just flag innocent writers — they also conveniently partner with “humanizer” tools.

That’s right, the same people selling the *AI detection solution* are also selling the *AI bypass solution*. It’s like a security company breaking into your house and then charging you for a better lock.

These humanizers don’t actually make writing *more human* — they just reword AI-generated content to trick detection tools. And guess what?

Some of these AI detection companies own or invest in humanizing software. It’s a racket. They create the problem and then profit from the solution. And who suffers? Honest writers.

Here is what one humanizing tool selling like hotcakes on the Internet says:

I didn’t provide link as I don’t want to promote them. If you are curious you can Google it.

They collaborate with other tools like this:

This means that if you use that humanizer, these so-called leading tools like [Originality.ai](http://Originality.ai), Copyleaks, Scribbr, or GTPZero will not detect any AI-generated content.

So what a great thing for thousands of unemployed people just to sit in front of a PC with free ChatGPT, Gemini, or CoPilot, [**produce 15 stories a day and spam Medium**](https://medium.com/illumination/who-the-hell-writes-15-stories-a-day-medium-stop-twisting-the-truth-da6e3dfd62e2). As curators will see 0% AI they might even boost and send to extended distribution.

Yes, [**Asking AI to Find AI Is the Dumbest Thing Humans Have Ever Done**](https://medium.com/illumination/asking-ai-to-find-ai-is-the-dumbest-thing-humans-have-ever-done-948ad70ffd1f)!

# And where does that leave us briefly?

In a world where content is judged by machines, not humans. Where creativity is shackled by algorithms. Where real writers are sidelined because they dared to write well and from the heart.

It’s time to stop worshipping bad tech.

AI detection tools are not the gatekeepers of truth. They’re just clumsy, unreliable guesswork wrapped in fancy branding that uses great communities like **Medium** as their clients or sponsors.

If we don’t push back now, we risk handing over the future of writing to machines that don’t understand it.

Real writers deserve better. They deserve recognition, respect, and a platform that values their craft — not abuse from systems that fail to understand the depth and soul of their work.

When writers feel invisible on a platform they once trusted, it’s not just a minor annoyance; it can trigger genuine distress, affecting motivation and self-worth.

It’s time to stand up for genuine human expression and demand accountability from the tools we rely on. Writers, of all people, should never have to prove their humanity to a machine.

I just move out less than a year ago. As much as it's liberating and agree with the freedom, I can't help but feel a bit sad and struggle mentally. I'm working from home and my everyday struggle is I need to destress outside cause I can't seem to separate home and work.   
  
Sometimes I work outside coffee shop to maintain my focus and just go back home whenever I'm done with my work. It's been a constant struggle lately.

1. How do you maintain your home as a safe space outside work?  
2. After work, what are your activities outside to destress? Challenge is I badly wanna go outside but Idk where to go or what to do. Hahaha. 

Not that I'm not trying or not doing anything, but I think I'm running out of options already. Hahaha.  
Currently I'm enrolled in workshops & classes, riding bicycle sometimes at night, hitting the gym, walking, going to random coffee shops, reading books. I'm running out of options hahahaha. After almost a year, I feel like I'm just running in circles. Ganto ba mag solo living? ",6,1738651102.0,SoloLivingPH,5,1.0,False

I have been fat, fit, fat again, fit again and here we are with adiposity circling around the waist again with aims to get the abs back before the arbitrary calendar date i popped out in the country, frantically compensating with boobies and abs for soul scars, something no amount of attention can heal.

The cosmic irony of having more comfort than a King and option to voluntarily starve yourself via to lose weight while vast majority of humanity struggled for food and still feeling inadequate about triviality not having abs would make Buddha chuckle, if he wasn't too busy being appropriated for overpriced wellness retreats attended exclusively by people who think karma is a LinkedIn strategy.

The existence of sugar free drinks, Low calorie ice cream and Ozempic pills should raise some red flags,

It's almost absurd how much ""looks"" effect your life, by ""looks"", I mean Sexual fitness indicators, Well We are nothing but genes itching to propagate with most stuff on display about us being sexual ornaments anyways, from shape of the nose and hip-shoulder ratio to sense of humor- > though Leaner i get, funnier i get. (is this a strawman?)

I have seen more sexually attractive women just today by 11 AM than cumulatively seen by my ancestors, shit is going haywire, I see cleavage and the reaction is of mild excitement at best and with added thoughts of ""i have better looking boobies"", Self Actualization is the Goal now for pretty much everybody i guess, without actually climbing the lower ladders of Maslow's hierarchies.

As i clutch to my down-going youth, remember when you peaked at 24? Neither do I, because I was too busy planning my life as if deterioration was something that happened to other people, like male-pattern baldness or an unironic fondness for crocs. Now here we are, watching time do its thing with all the subtlety of a baba in a roadside tent who has achieved nirvana but by chance, also happens to sell youth serums for Erectile dysfunctions and false promises.

99.9999% of Humanity before 1900 died before hitting the age of 38, The cosmic joke isn't just that we're aging – it's that we've invented Instagram filters and ""age-defying"" creams while our bodies are running on software that hasn't been updated since the Bronze Age. We're essentially trying to run the latest apps on hardware that was designed to last about 40 years, tops. The developers (evolution) have long since abandoned the project, leaving us with increasingly buggy performance and no customer support.

They say life is an open book test, but nobody mentioned that the pages start yellowing and the print keeps getting smaller. We're living in an era where we've managed to double our life expectancy through modern medicine yet somehow forgot to update the user manual. It's like getting a bonus 40 years of life and spending it watching our joints slowly betray us while trying to remember why we walked into this room.

Here's what they don't tell you in those chipper ""40 is the new 30"" articles: Your body starts its farewell tour sometime in your late 20s, but performs it with such subtle dedication that you don't notice until you can't get up from a crouch without making sound effects. Everything becomes a negotiation – between what you want to do and what your knees will allow, between staying out late and functioning the next day, between that second cup of coffee and actually sleeping tonight.

In the India we inherited with hope for a minimized caste/class/religion difference, most millennials did become their parents after all with same biases and bigotry– just with better phones and more existential dread. We're all either living the ""successful"" script (degrees, jobs, marriages, kids, blood sugar) or we're the cautionary tales at family gatherings. There's no third option where you age Benjamin Button-style while pursuing your media fueled dreams of some random vanity most times.

Modern life's dual curse isn't just living longer and aging faster – it's being constantly reminded of both through LinkedIn updates from people who seem to be aging in reverse. For every ""age is just a number"" inspiration post featuring some 56 year old korean guy doing one-handed pushups, Bryan Johnson drinking his son's blood, SRK playing as a 25 year old at 60, on other side, there are thousands trying to touch their toes without pulling something.

We've created a world where six-pack Santas compete for attention with meditation apps that promise inner peace in 10 minutes or less. We're trying to heal our souls through subscription models while our bodies run their unstoppable program of entropy. It's like trying to fix a hardware problem with a software update – sure, that mindfulness app might help you accept your declining metabolism, but it won't make your knees stop sounding like a bowl of Rice Krispies.

there's no SSRI pill for regrets, no yoga pose or breathing vipassana that reverses time, and no green tea strong enough to wash away the realization that we're not supposed to be alive this long. We're all just beta testing extended human life spans, and the bug reports are piling up.

Maybe your mother will remain a bitch, your father will consider you a disappointment till the end, his end i mean.

So here's to making peace with aging – not because we have a choice, but because the alternative is spending our bonus decades in a state of denial that makes plastic surgeons rich and our faces look increasingly surprised about it. Maybe wisdom isn't about transcending our mortality after all, but about learning to laugh at the absurdity of it all while our backs make mysterious new sounds.

1ihbfqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ihbfqu/why_does_my_bambino_steam_want_not_shut_off/,Why does my Bambino steam want not shut off immediately? [Breville Bambino],"So, I finally upgraded from my Delonghi Dedica Arte E885 to a Breville Bambino, as most people have recommended on this sub and the espresso temperature is so much better.

I love milk-based drinks and usually have my coffee with steamed milk and something I’ve noticed is that while with the Delonghi, there was amazing steam control and instant shut off when you turned the lever. 

This is not the case with the Breville Bambino which is three times the price of the Dedica, but with a steam wand that takes 4-5 seconds after turning off the steam for the steam to stop coming out. I haven’t been able to find any posts talking about this so I’m not sure if I’m the only one experiencing this or if anyone else is?

And if this is a known problem, is there any way to fix it because it’s getting really frustrating and I don’t really want to keep both machines side by side just to use the Dedica steam wand due to lack of counter space. Any help would be appreciated!

I consider myself an anglophile. Many people forget that the Sinhalese themselves were at one point colonisers from India. Of course I don't dispute the fact that there were drawbacks. However, most cultures throughout history have been colonisers! It is not boot licking to admit that certain cultures and societies have civilising effects on others. Take for example the abolishment of the practice of Sati (widows throwing themselves into burning funeral pyres of their husbands) in India by the British.

Here is a list of some of the benefits of British colonialism: 

*Roads
*Railways
*Telecommuncations
*Tea and coffee production
*Education and schools
*English (a global language) 
*Missionary work 
*Hospitals and medicine 
*Churches 
*Laws and courts of law 
*Access to higher education abroad 
*Higher standards of living
