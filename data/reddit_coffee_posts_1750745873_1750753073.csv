There is also crusting on the back of his ears but keeping at bay with the wipes. He's had a couple lesions/cuts on his forehead area that went away quickly with ointment. I took him to the vet two months ago and they checked his ear said just some yeast gave ear drops. Symptoms kept going so took him back a month later they did the ear crytology again and didn't find anything. I see brown specks in his ear canal and inner ear area often, as well as the base. He also has had hair thinning on and around his ears. In the flaps of his ears he had black and brown specks and marks, I know black coffee grounds indicate ear mites but it was only in the flaps of his ears and only several not a bajillion. I had him on a hydrocortisone/microsilver regimen from amazon for a 10 day course, went back on still no success now just using homeopathic ear wipes and today got a bottle of medicated ear flush at a health pet store. I'm considering taking him to a dermatologist since this ear itching has gone on over a couple month now. Regular vet said to do hydrolyzed protein diet to discover food allergies.

1lj5g3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lj5g3s/the_cold_case/,The Cold Case,"
On August 7, 1957, a young boy named Lucas went missing in the small, quiet community of Danby Hollow.

His best friend, Noah, gave a statement to police through tears. He said that Lucas disappeared into a clearing beyond Old Pine Road, stepping into what he described as a “perfect oval hole.” As far as Noah knew, he simply vanished, almost as if he had been erased. Noah insisted the hole made a low humming noise, and that when he came back a few days later, the hole was gone.

No one believed him. The search parties turned up nothing. With no other leads, the police assumed foul play. They put Lucas’s face on posters, questioned his estranged father, a few of his teachers, and even a local offender. But nothing stuck. No charges. No closure. No body.

As Noah grew older, he fell into addiction. Unable to cope with the loss of his best friend, he took his own life when he was just 19.

And over time, Danby Hollow moved on.

I’ve lived in this town for as long as I can remember. On the playground, kids would throw around urban legends of the disappearance, saying that his bones were supposedly buried beneath where the school stood. Ever since hearing about it, that case stuck with me. 

It was an open wound the town learned to ignore. During 2020, I fell deep into the world of true crime documentaries and podcasts, and I started to realize how many cold cases went unsolved simply because the technology didn’t exist at the time.

So, being freshly out of high school, and probably too curious for my own good, I decided to take a shot at digging into it myself.

I started with the usual stuff. Old newspapers, archived police reports, even a couple of fringe podcasts that mentioned the case. Eventually, I began wondering if any of Lucas’s family was still alive.

After a bit of online searching, I found a man named David, about fifty, living a few towns over. He carried the same last name as Lucas, but it was a decently common last name. I had to dig more. 

His Facebook was quiet. Just the usual AI-generated ""Good Morning"" posts and dated memes. But one thing caught my eye: a reposted article from the *Danby Hollow Tribune* recounting the 49-year anniversary of Lucas’s disappearance.

That was my proof. I messaged him that night.

“Hi David, I hope this isn’t too forward. My name is Rowan—I’m an investigative journalist from Danby Hollow. I’ve been looking into your brother’s case recently. Is there any way we can meet up at Julie’s Diner? Sincerely, Rowan.”

That was a lie—I’m not a journalist. But I figured it’d make him more likely to agree.

He didn’t reply for a while. Then, finally:

“Why now?”

I didn’t know how to respond. I froze. But he didn’t ask for proof of my job.

A minute later, he sent another message:

“That day, it ruined our family. I shouldn’t talk about it. But I can’t ignore it either. Have you ever felt it?”

I said yes. I had no idea what he meant, but I went with it.

Another pause.

“I’ve kept something. I was waiting for someone else to hear it too.”

We planned to meet that weekend at Julie's Diner.

The diner hadn’t changed in decades. The same peeling tiles, the old bitter coffee smell. I slid into a booth near the back and waited.

David showed up only minutes later than me, scanning the room like he was expecting someone. He looked older than fifty. Weathered, not aged. He locked eyes with me and began to approach.

“You Rowan?” he asked. No handshake, just sat down across from me.

I nodded.

He ordered coffee, then said nothing for a while. Just stared into the table. Then suddenly:

“It’s driving me insane. The buzzing, the knocking, the not knowing.”

He clenched his fists. “I recorded it. I listen to it over and over.”

He showed me the videos. They had dark grainy footage, barely any sound beyond static and wind. I humored him. We talked for about 15 minutes, when David blurted something out.

“Come to the house. Help me make sense of it. Hell, I’ll pay. Please.”

I hesitated, but something about his voice made it hard to say no. If anything crazy happened, at least I'd have a good story for my friends.

A while later, I was pulling into his driveway. A quiet suburb. Kids’ bikes on a nearby lawn. It eased my nerves, at least for a moment.

The house was a mess. Not hoarder-level, but unkempt. Clothes draped over furniture. Picture frames never hung. The smell of wet dogs and old tobacco hung in the air.

David barely looked at me. Just mumbled, “Be right back, I’ve got something downstairs I want to show you.”

He disappeared through a creaky door leading down into what I assumed was the basement.

I waited.

Five minutes. Then twenty. I checked my phone. No signal.

I walked around the room. Most of the family photos were turned backward. One still had the price tag on the frame.

“David?” I called out. No answer.

I waited longer than I’d like to admit, playing on my phone for nearly two hours. The silence in the house started to feel still, like the air wasn’t circulating.

Eventually, I stood up stretched, locking eyes with the basement door. I began to walk towards it.  It was still cracked open, the steps leading into pure darkness.

I called his name again. Still nothing.

Then, I heard it. Buzzing. It sounded like static, in the back of my head. It was so strange, unlike anything I had ever heard. I shook it off, and my thoughts came back to me.

I called out again, with nothing. Worried he might’ve fallen or gotten hurt, I headed down.

The stairs creaked under my weight. The air smelled like oil and mildew. At the bottom was a dusty old workbench covered in tapes, cassette players, and half-dismantled audio equipment.

No David.

There was another door. It looked almost metallic

I hesitated, then opened it and stepped inside.

It felt wrong immediately. The space beyond was too wide, too empty. The walls looked unfinished. Crates of old decorations and wrinkled clothes were scattered around, as if someone was planning to move out in a hurry.

I called his name again. Nothing.

My phone buzzed, then shut off. Battery had said 54%, now it’s dead.

I cursed quietly and felt around until I found  a hanging string light. As I pulled it, the bulb flared to life, casting long shadows across the room.

That’s when the door slammed behind me.

Floorboards above creaked. Loud. Followed by something dragging across the floor. Heavy. Sharp.

Panic set in fast. My eyes darted for a hiding place. I saw a crate beneath the stairs, half-filled with bundled clothes. I dove in and pulled the clothes over me, heart pounding so loud I thought whatever was upstairs could hear it.

Then came the footsteps. Slow. Thudding. Accompanied by that dragging again.

And a voice. Croaking. Like something trying to form words through waterlogged lungs.

“David…”

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

Eventually, it came into view.

Its head was huge—bulbous and swollen, pale like rotted paper. Two wet black orbs sat where its eyes should’ve been, unblinking. Its limbs were broken, the joints bending strangely, clicking faintly. The arms dragged behind it. They were too long, scraping against the floor with a dry, rasping sound.

It moved like it didn’t understand how to use its body. Like it was learning.

It stopped near the stairs, tilting its head.

Then the light blew out.

Everything went dark.

I heard it knocking things over, scraping across walls, searching.

Then… silence.

It felt like hours passed. The sound grew distant, like it had walked away—but the room wasn’t big enough for that.

I crept toward the stairs. As I reached the top, one of the lower steps creaked under my weight. I froze.

Nothing.

I bolted.

Burst through the door and into the kitchen. The lights were on. I turned back.

And it was there, on the bottom stair.

It tilted its head at me, eyes locked on mine.

Its mouth opened. Too wide. A deep, splitting gape lined with jagged rows of teeth. From that chasm, one word gurgled out:

“Lucas.”

I slammed the door, sprinted for the front, and flew out into the yard.

It was dark.

But it had only been two hours.

I jumped into my car, scrambling for the keys, finally found them in my back pocket, and sped off, tearing down the street like i had never driven before.

When I got home, I collapsed onto the couch, shaking. I didn’t even know what to think. What I’d seen. What that *thing* was. How it knew Lucas. How it knew David.

Then my phone buzzed.

A text.

From David.

“Thank you for listening, Rowan. It was nice to have someone actually interested in my story. I hope you got home safe!”

I stared at the screen, my blood running cold.

We hadn’t talked like that. We barely spoke. He disappeared almost immediately. What the hell was he talking about?

I texted him back, furious, accusing him of messing with me, of setting me up. Then I collapsed onto the couch again, my mind spiraling with questions. Was any of it real? What had I actually seen? Why had the thing said Lucas’s name?

My phone buzzed again.

David replied:

“Rowan, what are you talking about? You were at my place. We talked for over an hour, about the case, about my brother, and the town. You even asked to see the garage, remember? I enjoyed our conversation, Rowan. I really did. But I guess you just wanted to make a mockery of it. You asked thoughtful questions, you seemed genuine, now you’re saying something happened in my basement? Rowan, I don’t even have a basement.

I don’t know what kind of joke you’re trying to pull, but if this is how you treat people who open up to you, don’t bother contacting me again.”

dinner: nothing (idk why but I lose appetite after the gym)

Total All Day: 420 calories

I have an app that shares logs of what I ate with my trainer and ive added random shit to make it about 1200 calories. I'm 26 male 5'6 about 190 lb. My weight is not drastically dropping. Today was a bit absurd even for me but I don't usually get more than around 1000 calories. I'm supposed to be getting around 1900-2000 calories according to the macros my trainer has assigned. 

I don't know why, but I feel full, even now. 

I haven't had issues in the gym even with the cardio. I'm not new to the gym by any means but I've taken many breaks over the years which is why got a trainer to help with the diet aspect. To her, I'm losing weight consistent with how someone normally would if they really did follow the diet. I'm kinda scared to tell her lol. Does anyone know why I might be ""full"" after only 400 calories? Ive read some stuff about how it might be that my body is in ""starvation mode"". If I ate 2000 calories in a day I KNOW I would feel super bloated and the scale would definitely be higher tomorrow. Im not worried about the scale going up or down, it's the body fat percentage I want to lose. Knowing myself and understanding my genetics after years of working out, I pack on fat super easily. I didn't always used to eat this little, in fact if I had no self control I could physically probably eat 5000+ calories 

If it IS ""starvation mode"" how can I revert this? Will there be a period of time where I'm just going to have to accept being constantly bloated to reverse this? I want to fix this so if that's the case I will do it.

I jumped into my car, scrambling for the keys, finally found them in my back pocket, and sped off, tearing down the street like i had never driven before.

When I got home, I collapsed onto the couch, shaking. I didn’t even know what to think. What I’d seen. What that *thing* was. How it knew Lucas. How it knew David.

Then my phone buzzed.

A text.

From David.

“Thank you for listening, Rowan. It was nice to have someone actually interested in my story. I hope you got home safe!”

I stared at the screen, my blood running cold.

We hadn’t talked like that. We barely spoke. He disappeared almost immediately. What the hell was he talking about?

I texted him back, furious, accusing him of messing with me, of setting me up. Then I collapsed onto the couch again, my mind spiraling with questions. Was any of it real? What had I actually seen? Why had the thing said Lucas’s name?

My phone buzzed again.

David replied:

“Rowan, what are you talking about? You were at my place. We talked for over an hour, about the case, about my brother, and the town. You even asked to see the garage, remember? I enjoyed our conversation, Rowan. I really did. But I guess you just wanted to make a mockery of it. You asked thoughtful questions, you seemed genuine, now you’re saying something happened in my basement? Rowan, I don’t even have a basement.

I don’t know what kind of joke you’re trying to pull, but if this is how you treat people who open up to you, don’t bother contacting me again.”

I ask her out for ice cream after some cute back and forth. She mentions she's vegan, I say I know and that I picked a place with that in mind becase I saw it on her profile. She then says, "" what place?"" I give her the name and explain how they have vegan sorbets as well as tea and coffee. 

Eventually she tells me that she has a place in mind in another city (I assume closer to her as I believe shes about 20min out from the location I picked), and ask if I'd be willing to meet her there instead. 

Now I've let the girl dictate where we'd have our first dates before and it has failed me everytime. I'm always put out of my element and she always feels that she needs to steer the night because she picked and it just becomes un fun and feels like a waste of time. 

I want to retort with:

""I definitely want to come out that way sometime, but I’ve actually got a fun night planned with a little surprise in the mix. Trust me it’s gonna be a good time."" 

I feel that she's probably thinking, ""my interest in this guy isn't high enough to drive 20-25 min, I dont want to drive that far for just ice cream, etc.

He brought you along, though he barely looked your way. Meetings, phone calls, late nights at the office—he left you alone more than with him. I noticed the frustration in your eyes… the loneliness.

At first, we barely spoke. Then came the small talk over coffee, shared glances in the elevator, and conversations that went deeper than they should have. You asked me things—not just about the project, but about *me*. You said he doesn’t listen anymore, doesn’t see you.

That night at the hotel bar, he cancelled dinner again. You sat beside me instead. We drank. Talked. Laughed. And when your hand brushed against mine, neither of us pulled away.

Maybe it was wrong. Maybe it was inevitable.

I 28F am married to a man 31M , let's call him David, for 3 years. David and I are very much in love and have a very happy married life. 
Now onto the conflict. I had a friend 28M, we'll call him Chris, since we were 15 years old. Chris was very close friend , second only to my bestie. When we were 18 Chris told me that he liked me and wanted to be in a relationship. I on the other hand never had liked chris romantically. I refused his offer and after not talking to me for days , Chris returned and said that we could stay friends. 
When we were 22 Chris again told me that he loved me still and if I want , we can be together. I again had refused him. Time went by and after a year I met David. We were instantly connected and in love. We decided to get married a year later.
When I told Chris about all this he got very upset, understandably so. He cut off all contact with me on social media and in real life and just disappeared. I didn't try to contact him because I thought seeing me with David will only hurt him.
After 3 years of being gone, Chris came back to the city , contacted me and asked to catch up. I was delighted because he was such a close friend of mine for a decade. I agreed thinking that time would have healed him and he would have moved on. 
I met him for coffee. After initial reminiscing about old times and all the fun stuff, Chris became serious and said "" No but seriously, I am still in love with you and available any moment for anything and everything"". 
Mind you he has a girlfriend, he claims it's just casual. I told him that I never loved him and I am very happily married to David. And I left. 
Afterwards chris texted me that he is sorry for his behaviour and will not do it again. But he'll like to stay in touch. And I accepted it naively. 
Since then Chris has been bombarding me with cute messages or heartbroken reels. When I confronted him, he said "" At least use me if, you can't love me."" It shocked me. I am not talking to him since. 
I  feel that I am responsible for Chris' situation and bad condition because I couldn't return his feelings,and so I should help him get out of it. Even though I didn't do anything to lead him on or gave false hopes, I should be considerate of my friend.
My husband knows nothing of it.  He just knows that Chris is my friend from a long time. I don't want to tell him all this because even though I am faithful to him, I don't want to make him wonder if I am also in love with Chris. David and I were both each other's first relationship so we never had problems regarding to exes. But now if I tell him, he may wonder if something is going on and that doubt may potentially ruin our relationship.  David has never had doubts about my loyalty to him and I do not want to insert unnecessary doubts in his mind about it.

This question was asked by a fan and I wanted to answer it through this fiction
It takes place at the end of the last episode of season 2.
I hope you like it.


Rick had just said goodbye and took his ex-wife by the arm to go to the Hamptons to relive their rekindled love. She had been on the verge of confessing to him what she felt for him and cruel fate had stolen her confessions which she would now have to keep buried inside her.

Behind the window, Montgomery, Esposito, Ryan and Lanie had all watched, stunned, as the fatal blow took place. Lanie immediately joined Kate to try to console her but Kate refused with her hand, grabbed her jacket and left at the speed of light towards her apartment to cry without having to face the gaze of others.



As soon as she entered her house, she grabbed the bottle of whiskey from the minibar and downed a good half of it. She collapsed into the sofa, repeating the word “Why” over and over again.

Why had she waited so long to confess her feelings to him? Why had she upset him by dating Demming? Why did she ultimately need him so much? Why had he gotten back together with Gina? Why, why, why??? She obviously felt responsible for this mess and it made her furious. She knew that she was the one who had the answers to all these questions and by failing to answer them honestly, she had ruined any possibility of a future with him. She finished the bottle of whiskey and collapsed onto the carpet, her couch having gone out of reach.



The next day, she woke up, her head in a fog as she heard her doorbell ring and ring again.

She sat up with difficulty and went to open it, her eyes half open. It was Lanie. Her best friend just had time to take Kate under her shoulder and carry her to the sofa.



(Lanie): Girl, you need some aspirin and a good liter of coffee to get started. Then a good shower and we'll see what we can do with you afterwards.

(Kate): Whatever you want, Lanie.



Lanie took charge and made the coffee while she found two aspirin tablets in the pharmacy which she made Kate swallow with a little water.



(Lanie): You know, I was really worried when Esposito called me to tell me you weren't at work this morning. I left all my dead behind to come see what was going on and I'm very happy to see that you're alive. Thinking back to yesterday's scene, we all understood how devastated you must have been. Even Montgomery was worried. And when I see the state you're in, I tell myself that I did really well to pass.

(Kate): Yes, thank you very much Lanie. I can always count on you, all the time. If only that were the case...

Who are you talking about here? From Castle?

Obviously ! From who else...

My daughter, you are totally delusional. You who usually precede everyone to identify someone, you have lacked and you still lack discernment concerning this man so I will have to, for your own good, that I enlighten you.

You know Lanie, I don't know if I want to talk about this right now.

You won't have to talk, in any case you would say things to sink in even more. But you're going to listen to me really carefully. I'll bring you a double espresso and I'll explain.

Lanie returned to the kitchen and filled a mug with coffee so strong that Kate could only open her eyes and consequently her ears.



(Lanie): First of all, I want to tell you that the shot of Gina coming back into the landscape, no one would have seen it coming. So, on that side, we are all united at the post. Now I can tell you, and of this I am sure too, your story with Castle is not over. It just got a little more complicated but, like him, you only played to make it complicated. Today, you're the one who takes the high price, but don't forget that Castle has already taken the high price in your story. So I will try to make you see and understand things from my point of view and I bet you that in the end, you will know what to do and what meaning to give to your life.

Ok Lanie, I'm listening.

I'm going to start by telling you about Castle. The day he met you, he immediately saw in you an extraordinary person, strong in his convictions, sensitive in his emotions, intelligent and, the icing on the cake for him, quite pretty. Playing with you, making you stand out, making you smile and even laugh, solving difficult cases together has become very important to him. It was his way of showing you that he respected you, that he even worshiped you to the point of wanting to make you his new heroine in a novel. He has done everything to create a bond between you based on good humor but also the seriousness of the work without forgetting the courage and self-sacrifice which are not the lot of just anyone. He wasn't trying to seduce you, which would undoubtedly have been a more feasible path for him, he was trying to gain your trust and your friendship. And then, you opened up to him by showing him your mother's ring and your father's watch and explaining to him what these objects represented to you. What more beautiful sign could he expect from you at that moment? He discovered the real Kate Beckett, sensitive, with buried demons that we don't want to show to anyone. It was no longer Lieutenant Beckett or even Nikki Heat that he had before him but a human person who was trying to tell him: “I'm going to trust you. Don’t betray me.” I'll bet everything I have that that's when Castle started to believe in a serious relationship with you. From that moment on Castle never again tried to make fun of you or look for a way to upset you. On the contrary, he said to himself: she trusts me so I'm going to devote myself to her and help her solve what has been haunting her for so long. It was his first real sign of affection. Certainly, he acted clumsily but he moved the lines of an investigation that you had left at a standstill. Let's be clear, young lady, at that moment, you were very harsh with him, even if we understand why, but it was nevertheless he who found the strength to come and apologize. Again, it was a real sign of affection. Few men are capable of this. Especially since at the same time, you had also awkwardly flirted with Sorenson.

Oh my God, I didn't get my fill last night, I need to get more!

It's for your own good and no, I'm not finished. I am determined to go all the way so that I never again fear finding you in this state or worse. So let's start again. From that moment on, he decides to follow you in the most attentive way possible, he brings you your coffee, he supports you, he brings you ideas that give you a real boost in your investigations, starting with the one where you almost burned and where he went to look for you in the flames. He allowed you to save Agent Shaw and his cohort of FBI warriors and brought you to Coonan. Here again you do not appreciate the immense signs of affection from your sidekick who could easily be described as a damn good teammate. And then there's the Kira Blane episode. Castle relives his youth with a girl he had been deeply in love with. He knows he is in a strong position to collapse Kira's marriage but he doesn't do it. For what ? Because he just realized that the one he loves today is you. But he also knows that you will never be part of the club of girls he got into his bed simply with his handsome, handsome face, so he is waiting to see a sign from you. And even though you sometimes seem to be having fun with him, he's waiting for a real sign. He's not coming. So yes, he falls for the beautiful Elie Monroe who makes him happy. He's just a man in the prime of his life and he needs to clear his head too. And when I say head, you understand me. Then, as if by chance, Demming arrives on the scene. At first, he takes it as a sort of retaliation game and then everything seems to become serious between you so he leaves the dojo and celebrates his departure from the police station with us. He looks good but we all know his heart is sad. And then you finally show up to tell Castle that you too care about him and that you are ready to consider a more intimate relationship with him. You broke up with Demming over this. But Gina didn't wait for you, she pounced on a destroyed Castle who had waited too long for the sign that you finally wanted to give him and found himself once again chained to his exploiter. Now you go take a shower and come back so I can talk to you about yourself!

Wow! Lanie, I'm not sure I want to go for a second round!

Go shower, and come back. You will see that the second round ends better than the first.

Okay.



Kate stayed in the shower for a while and still came out crying.



(Kate): I screwed up, didn't I?

(Lanie): Yes, but I swear I'll still cheer you up. With you, we will start from scratch. First of all, before you even knew him in real life, Castle wasn't a stranger to you. You were a real fan and you were waiting in line for a signing. Admit that you felt close to him and his writings. It made sense to take the opportunity of murder to meet him. Your verbal jousts stimulated and electrified you. At that precise moment, you found your smile again, even if it annoyed you deeply sometimes. It took you, like, five investigations with him to understand that he could be sensitive, caring, and then you also discovered his courage and his deep respect for you. At that precise moment, I don't think you were already in love with him, otherwise there would have been no return Sorenson. But I know that there was already trust and complicit friendship. And then you said you felt betrayed when he reopened your mother's file but inside you were hungry to know what he found. However, you couldn't stand his arrogance and this propensity to not listen to what you said to him so, behind his sincere apologies – and I assure you as moving as improbable in Castle's mouth – you still cowered despite all the moments where he helped you and where he even saved your life. At the same time you saw him be a caring father and a loving son and so you knew he could be capable of true feelings towards someone. And you started to believe in something possible with him and, instead of telling him, you didn't say anything. He then sent you lots of signals that you saw because I know you're not stupid. And you gave nothing in return and yet how many times I pushed you to do so. As a result, Miss Monroe didn't have to do much to make him succumb. So instead of explaining yourself and confessing your feelings, you played with Demming who shouldn't have had to go through that either. And then you woke up when he said he was leaving and Esposito made you understand that that meant the end of your meeting. So you took the bull by the horns and started to open your heart to Castle but fate mocked: to punish you, he sent Gina and, once again, you had to re-close your feelings. If we take stock now: I think Castle understood that he really loved you when he definitively closed the memories attached to Kira Blane and, from there, he waited until you were ready. And you understood that you loved him too when he told you that he was leaving, supposedly to write but quite simply because he was sad to see that his signals weren't working and that waiting for you while looking at you with Demming was breaking his heart. Castle is probably guilty of waiting but he did it because he didn't want to rush you anymore. You, the goddess of truth, spent your time lying to him by never opening up your feelings to him. Who do you think is the most blameworthy?

Me, Lanie.

Okay, we're making progress. Now, what's next? First of all, he told you he'd be back in the fall. So the thread is not broken. Besides, he didn't leave with a new woman, he left with Gina. Gina, from whom he has already divorced and I tell you my note that it won't take long for it to explode again and for the same reasons. So, here's what I think: you're going to take advantage of this break that you didn't want to find your values ​​and ask yourself the right questions that will allow you to have a sincere relationship again with him or even someone else, if you really want to. Your pivot has always been “the truth”. So never lie again, neither to others nor to yourself. He's gone but he's not far away. I feel it, I know it. But if you want to go further with him, change your method, prepare for his return and have the courage of your feelings.

Maybe you're right, Lanie.

Of course I'm right! Come on ! Get dressed and let's go to work. Work is the best thing when nothing else is going well.

Ok Lanie, I follow you and thank you.

1lj51u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1lj51u5/being_comfortable_with_rejection_made_me/,Being comfortable with rejection made me emotionally strong,"I once apologized to a cashier for buying groceries.

Yeah, you read that right. I literally said ""sorry"" for existing as a customer. That's how desperate I was for everyone to like me. I was so used to people pleasing, constantly scanning faces for disapproval, trying to always match my personality to people so they'll like me.

I was living in a prison of my own creation, and the bars were made of other people's opinions.

The wake-up call came during my birthday party. I'd invited 20 people and spent weeks stressing about the guest list, the food, the music and desperate to create the ""perfect"" experience so everyone would have fun and think I was cool. Three people showed up.

I sat in my place surrounded by enough snacks to feed a small people, feeling like the biggest loser on earth. I was sad but after I looked around at those three friends, I realized they were my *real* friends and we were having a great time. They were just happy to be there. Not caring if more people turned up.

That night, I made a decision that changed everything: I was going to stop acting for other people's sake but learn to manage my own.

**Here's how I learned to stop caring about if everyone liked me:**

* I gave myself a goal to get rejected once a day for 30 days. Ask for a discount at full-price stores. Ask strangers for their phone numbers. Request free dessert at restaurants. The goal wasn't success but to normalize rejection. My first rejection was a coffee shop for a free drink. The barista said no. I didn't die. The world didn't end. Nobody pointed and laughed. It was just nothing. I was glad honestly. So those anxious thoughts weren't real.
*  Realized people don't remember your embarrassing moments. I started timing how long I thought about other people's awkward moments. A saw a stranger trip and remembered about it days later. I forget in 30 seconds. And when somebody stuttered I also forgot about it by lunch. If I barely remember other people's embarrassing moments, why would they obsess over mine?
* I wrote down what I actually believed versus what I pretended to believe around different people. The gap was massive. I was like wearing a mask for myself a lot I'd lost track of who I actually was. I expressed my real opinion about a movie. Didn't laugh at jokes I didn't find funny. Wore clothes I liked instead of what was ""safe."" Each authentic choice felt terrifying but somehow freeing.
* My friend told me something that broke my brain: ""If you try to be liked by everyone, you'll be loved by no one."" I identified the 3 people whose opinions actually mattered to my life and happiness. Everyone else became noise. It's harsh but it freed me from caring too much about other people's opinions A coworker made a sneaky comment about my new haircut in front of the whole team. Old me would've spiraled for weeks. New me just shrugged and said, ""Cool, thanks for sharing"". The room went quiet. Then someone else changed the subject. That's it. No drama, no confrontation, no world-ending experience. Just boundaries. Stopped talking to that guy from that day.

**Here's what nobody tells you about when you prioritize yourself:**

* It doesn't mean becoming an asshole. It means becoming selective about where you invest your emotional energy. It means choosing authenticity over approval.
* You'll lose some people. Good. Those weren't your people anyway. The ones who stay will like you for who you actually are, not the mask you've been putting on.
* You'll feel guilty at first. Your people-pleasing brain will scream that you're being ""mean"" or ""selfish."" That's just the old programming. Ignore it.

Six months later, I have fewer friends but deeper relationships. I sleep better because I'm not replaying embarrassing conversations anymore. I make decisions based on my values, not my fears. I still care what people think but I don't let it paralyze me anymore.

Next time someone doesn't laugh at your joke, or gives you a weird look, or seems unimpressed just notice it and move on. Don't analyze. Don't adjust. Don't apologize for existing.

1lj4www,https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1lj4www/macbook_recommendation/,MacBook recommendation,"Hi everyone. Looking for a bit of a recommendation here.

I recently owned a 2021 MacBook Pro M1 Max with maxed out specs so 64gb ram 32 core gpu etc. I loved it. Recently I was working late and spilled coffee on it (rip laptop). Thankfully I had insured it, and so just got the settlement as it was beyond economical repair. 

Basically I’m now looking at replacing it but seem to have a couple options.

Option 1 - buy a like for like but maybe go for the 16 inch version. So MacBook Pro M1 Max 32 core gpu 64gb ram. I can pick one up for circa £1500. I have around £2k to spend (settlement as it also covered a failed repair on the old machine). If I went with this option I’d also pick up an iPad Pro to streamline my workflows as I’m an architect and have been looking for a while for one as the digital sketching is a game changer. 

Option 2 - buy a newer model (m2 max or m3 pro) so it’s supported for longer as I envision using this laptop for the foreseeable future. Would still look at getting the iPad but perhaps put it on ice for a while. 

Both options aren’t relied on for professional work as I do have a work machine for that, it’s more for passion projects e.g. video editing, moonlighting and graphic design for friends along with having capability of doing work under my own steam.

What would be the recommended case? Also, does anyone know of any refurb sites that allow trade in of old/broken machines? My old machine isn’t financially viable to repair for a consumer, however I imagine this would be different for a supplier or at least there may be a few donor parts that are fairly valuable from my machine. 

Basically, for my use case as video editing, photoshopping, adobe suite etc has the MacBook Pro really improved much since the leap to the M1 Max? I never noticed any performance issues with it and it’s the option I’m leaning towards but just wanted to make sure I wasn’t being dumb.

but the only connections i have so far, are my office colleagues, which are all senior than me. and that isnt even the problem, its the fact that they’re lazy, and reluctant for outdoor plans.

and i’ve seen this pattern in general. people here are okay paying for organized events, parties, gatherings which are heavily planned and managed by third parties in many cases.

the authentic sense of co-existing, and doing things spontaneously and unexpectedly has been lost. they wont be down for a random stroll, giggling over rubbish talks, that ends with a movie, or coffee, or shopping, or jamming, or a thousand other things that were not planned.

and it’s not like i dont bring value as a person. i am smart and i talk nice, i take care of myself, i workout, i am a pretty good singer, i run instagram theme pages side business, and i love to have fun.

honestly, at this point i’ve just accepted the fact that almost everybody here is disconnected in those ways, and hence they need to compulsively use money for networking. 
and i blatantly refuse to fall for that propaganda.


if you think our vibe could match, i’m looking forward to talk. dms are open!

I'm a solo maker and like many of you, I’ve had dozens of ideas I wanted to test or launch quickly. But every time, I hit the same wall: spending *way too much time* setting up a landing page, tweaking design, messing with forms, or setting up hosting.

So I built [Shipwait](https://www.shipwait.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=SideProject&utm_campaign=launch), a super lightweight tool to help you launch landing pages in minutes and start collecting emails from day one.

Some highlights:

* 🚀 **Ship fast** — get something live while your coffee’s still hot
* 🎨 **Tweak easily** — change colors, text, and branding without design skills
* 🛠️ **Go full custom if needed** — built-in code editor lets you control everything
* 📬 **Capture demand early** — built-in email form, no extra setup

Perfect for:

* Testing new product ideas
* Launching side projects
* Getting feedback before you build
* Growing an audience from day one

It’s free to use, just something I made to help myself move faster, and hopefully it helps others too.

Would love feedback from other solo builders. What's missing for your own launch workflow?",0,1750750469.0,SideProject,1,0.5,False
1lj4v4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1lj4v4s/someones_been_leaving_gifts_on_my_porch_theyre/,Someone's Been Leaving Gifts on My Porch. They’re All Things I Haven’t Lost Yet.,">*Quick note: This is my first creepypasta story ever. I've always been interested in storytelling through artworks, horror and creepypasta's, but I thought id try and write a story.*

It started small. A mug. Navy blue, chipped at the handle.

Not from any dramatic drop, just years of knocking against the same sink lip. I’d had it since college. It used to have a logo for some startup I never worked for, rubbed off now into a vague, ghostly stain. It was the kind of mug you don’t even think about until it’s gone.

After the breakup, I didn’t take much with me. Just the basics: a few boxes, some clothes, whatever I could fit in the backseat without making a second trip. The mug came with me. Not out of sentimentality, I didn’t feel sentimental. Just habit. You keep what works.

The house was the cheapest rental I could find within an hour of my job. Small, a little too far out into the woods for my taste, but it had a porch and no neighbours in sight. After everything with Claire, that part appealed to me. Silence was easier than explaining anything.

The morning I found the mug on the porch, I figured I must’ve left it there the night before. It had been one of those nights. The kind where sleep never quite sticks, and you sit outside wrapped in a hoodie, watching the dark for no reason. I couldn’t remember taking it out there, but that didn’t mean anything. Lately, a lot of things slipped my mind.

What gave me pause was walking into the kitchen afterward and seeing it... *my mug*. still sitting on the counter. Cold coffee inside. Same chip on the handle. Same fading ghost of a logo.

I walked back to the porch, picked up the other one. It was still warm. Like it had just been poured.

For a long minute I just stood there, one mug in each hand, trying to feel some kind of explanation take shape. They were identical. Not similar. *Identical*. Same scratches on the base. Same spot where the glaze had bubbled slightly near the lip.

How could this be the exact same mug? I felt confused.  
Like a detail in the background of my life had quietly rearranged itself.

I set them both on the counter, I tried to make up some sort of reasoning in my mind but  I couldn’t think of anything. I guess I have a second mug now.

The next morning, my hoodie was folded neatly on the porch railing.

And I hadn’t taken it off.

I stood there in the doorway, barefoot, blinking into the morning haze. The chill bit through the sleeves. Same dark grey fabric, frayed cuffs, the little tear under the left arm where the seam had split months ago.

The one on the railing was identical. Folded with care, like someone had taken the time to line the edges just right. Not tossed. Not forgotten. *Placed.*

I ran my hand over the fabric of the one I had on and then picked up the other one. Same faded tag. Same loose thread at the hem. The tear was there too, in the exact same spot.

It was like someone had made a perfect copy of what I was already wearing.

And left it for me to find.

Two of them. Just like the mug.

Something settled in my chest. Not fear. Just a hard awareness.

I brought the porch hoodie in and laid it next to the first one. I didn’t know what else to do with it. I stared at them both for a long time, then went and looked at the mug again, still sitting on the kitchen counter next to its twin. Four items. Two duplicates. No explanation.

I tried to come up with a reason. Something logical. A prank, maybe. A break-in I somehow slept through. But who would go to the trouble of copying a mug or folding a hoodie with that kind of care?

And how would they get everything exactly right?

Maybe I was losing it. Stress, isolation, it does things to people. I hadn’t talked to anyone in days. Maybe my mind was filling the silence with noise.

But this wasn’t noise. These were *objects*. Physical. Solid. And too perfect to ignore.

That evening, I took a small spiral notebook out of my jacket. The one I’d been using for grocery lists and random reminders, and started writing everything down. The mug. The hoodie. Date. Time. Where I found them. Where the originals were when I checked.

Nothing fancy. Just facts.

I didn’t want to believe something strange was happening.

But I also didn’t want to forget the order of things just in case there was a pattern.

 

By the third morning, I wasn’t surprised to see something waiting for me.

It was my paperback copy of *The King in Yellow*, slightly water-warped from a spill a few years back. I’d been rereading it before bed. The real one was still on my nightstand, with a folded receipt marking page 132.

The copy on the porch was opened to the same page, the receipt in the same place. Same fold. It shouldn’t have been familiar, but it was.

I took it inside and laid it next to the original. The pages were a little stiffer, maybe newer. But everything else, even the cracked spine, was identical.

That made three duplicates in three days.

By now, I’d stopped pretending it wasn’t weird. Still, I didn’t tell anyone. I didn’t have anyone to tell, and even if I had, what was I supposed to say? *Hey, something’s leaving copies of my stuff on the porch, and they’re exactly right, but also somehow... not*?

I started checking the porch compulsively every morning. Sometimes twice. There was never anything at night. Or if there was, I never caught it. I even stayed up once, watching from the couch, facing the front door like a hunter. Nothing happened. I fell asleep around 4 a.m.

That morning: my wristwatch. The old one with the cracked face I always meant to replace. Still ticking. Still on my dresser, too. Now I had two of them, both set to the same time, down to the second.

That’s when I grabbed a fresh page in my notebook, like it mattered. And I started scribbling down *everything* I owned. Every single thing I could remember. Mugs. Books. Clothes. Electronics. Kitchen junk. The cheap corkscrew. The old backpack. Even that stupid dented flashlight buried in the junk drawer.

I didn’t even know what I was looking for. Maybe I would find somekind of pattern. But writing it all down made me feel like I had a grip on it, or at least like I was *doing* something. And when something shows up on the porch, I would go straight back to the list and slashed a red line through it. Noted. Accounted for. Under control.

So far, four items. Mug. Hoodie. Book. Watch.

The notebook was already half-filled by the end of the day.

I didn’t want to admit how much it comforted me. the list.

 

Around the fifth day, I started reaching for explanations.  
Claire crossed my mind.

It didn’t make much sense. She didn’t have a key, had never been to this house, and I never told her where I was going. But maybe she figured it out. I’d posted some things after the breakup. Nothing specific, but enough to trace if you really wanted to.  
It didn’t feel like her. We hadn’t ended badly, just quietly. But maybe she needed something unresolved.

That morning, the porch gift was my lighter. Same scratch by the thumbwheel, same half-worn label.

I checked my coat. Mine was still there, warm from the sun.  
I stared at the new one for a while. Then I messaged her: *Hey. If this is you, I need you to stop. It’s messing with my head.*

She replied about an hour later: *“What? I’m in the Netherlands. Visiting my parents. I haven’t been in the country since last week. Are you okay?”*

STUPID, I knew this, she planned this trip long before we even split up.

I didn’t answer.

I just locked my phone, set it face down, and stared at the lighter.

I sat there for a while, holding both lighters in my hands, flipping the wheels just enough to spark without igniting.

Then I broke it. Smashed it into the counter until the plastic split. It didn’t help. But it felt like pushing back.

The next morning, my kitchen towel was folded on the porch step.

The original was still hanging from the oven handle.

I burnt down the copy.

It built up slowly.

At first, the duplicates were strange, but manageable. One a day, always familiar, always intact. Mugs. Books. Socks. Pens. Everything I used, everything I touched, eventually showed up on the porch. One by one. No fanfare. No tracks. Just… there.

So I started breaking them.

Just the porch copies. I told myself it was harmless. They weren’t *mine*, not really. Just extras. Hollow things. And I still had the originals. It started with smashing items against the concrete. Tearing the sleeves off shirts. I kept a small hammer near the door after a while. Morning ritual.

Smash. Sweep. Forget.

Then the originals started vanishing.

I didn’t notice at first. It was subtle. A book missing from the nightstand. A pair of socks I swore were in the laundry, gone without a trace. A kitchen knife I used the night before, nowhere in the drawer.

And each time, the next porch item was... *off*.

Not in a big way. Just enough to notice.

A mug was a little taller. The spine of a book was stiffer. A shirt was the right colour, but the fabric felt wrong. Too smooth, too new. The handwriting on a sticky note wasn’t quite mine.

It wasn’t replacing the broken copies with more copies.

It was replacing *my* things. Taking the originals.

And now the new ones, the ones it left behind, were getting worse at pretending.

 

There had to be someone.

That was the only explanation that made any kind of sense. Not ghosts. Not some supernatural bullshit. A person. Someone with too much time, too much access, and a reason to screw with me.

A stalker.

I hated the word. Not because it was over the top, but because it landed too close to something real. Like saying it out loud might give it shape, make it stick. It sounded like something you’d hear whispered in the middle of a story that never ends well. But what else could it be?

Someone was watching me. Tracking what I owned, what I used, what I touched. They were sneaking in, making perfect copies, then, somehow, replacing the originals. And now they were slipping. Getting sloppy. Making small mistakes. A tag sewn wrong. A different brand of pen ink. A hoodie that made of a different fabric.

I started going over possibilities. A neighbour? Unlikely.  there weren’t any within walking distance. A former coworker? A stranger I’d pissed off somehow?

I couldn’t think of anyone who’d hate me enough to pull this off. But then again, maybe it wasn’t about hate. Maybe it was obsession.

That thought chilled me more than I expected.

Because if it was a stalker, then that meant someone had been in my house. More than once. Dozens of times, probably. Moving quietly. Watching me sleep. Learning my habits. Slipping in and out without ever making a sound. And leaving me these… gifts.

Not notes. Not warnings. Just things I already owned, placed gently on the porch, as if I’d forget they hadn’t always been there.

I wanted to catch them.

Not confront them. I’m not an idiot. Just *see* them. Confirm they existed. That it wasn’t all in my head. That someone, somewhere, was walking up to my porch in the dead of night with a duplicate mug or sock or hoodie like it was a delivery route.

So I stayed up.

Just me, a hoodie, a thermos of bitter coffee, and a folding chair angled toward the steps. Porch light off. Eyes open.

The air was still and damp. Crickets, mostly. Every now and then a breeze would drag itself through the trees, but otherwise it was quiet in that deep, hollow way that only happens out here. The kind of quiet that makes your own heartbeat feel too loud.

I sat there for hours.

The night stretched on, and my thoughts slowed the way they always do when it’s late and your body wants to sleep but your mind refuses to quit. I started thinking about the list in my jacket. the items I hadn’t crossed off yet. My boots. My keys. The picture of me and my brother from that one summer road trip. No matter how hard I thought about it I could not figure out a pattern, or who this stalker could be.

A little after three, I heard it.

Knocking.

Not from the porch.

From inside the house.

Three slow, deliberate knocks. Not on the front door, but somewhere deeper. Not loud, but clear. Like someone wanted me to hear, but not react too fast.

I stood up. The porch boards creaked under my weight. I turned toward the front door, then glanced over my shoulder. Nothing behind me, no shadows moving in the yard.

The knocking came again. This time from the kitchen.

I stepped inside.

Nothing. Everything still. No windows open, no breeze, no sign of forced entry. I walked into the kitchen, barefoot on cold tile. That eerie half-light before dawn was just beginning to creep into the corners of the room.

And there, sitting neatly on the kitchen counter, was the notebook.

The one I kept in my jacket.

Open to a new page.

A page I hadn’t written yet.

Tomorrow’s date was at the top. Under it: one line.

*Item: House key.*

I left that morning.

Didn’t pack much. just some clothes, my wallet, the notebook, my keys. I threw it all into my backpack and drove. I did not want to look around the house. I did not feel safe. I had no plan, no direction at first, just distance. I couldn’t stay in that house another night. Not after the knocking. Not after seeing my own handwriting predicting what hadn’t happened yet.

It didn’t feel like a place I lived in anymore.

It felt like a place something else had been living through me.

I found a cheap motel two towns over. a squat, roadside place with the kind of parking lot lit by buzzing floodlights and half-dead bugs in every overhead fixture. I paid for three nights in cash and gave a fake name, even though I knew how pointless that was.

Room 12. Ground floor. Small bathroom, two lamps that didn’t match, and a TV bolted to the dresser. The bedspread had a cigarette burn shaped like a question mark.

It was exactly what I needed.

For a few hours, I felt safe. Not good, just unobserved. I kept the curtains closed. Left the lights on. Tried not to check the duplicate list, but I did anyway.

Nothing new had been crossed off.

When I finally started to relax, I ordered takeout, took a long shower, and tried to fall asleep with the TV playing some muted wildlife documentary. It didn’t have Netflix.

It was just after seven. I left the room to grab a coffee from the lobby, barely awake.

I opened the door and stopped.

There it was, right in front of me on the carpet.

My house key.

Not just similar. *Mine.* Same worn-down grooves. Same frayed leather keychain with the little brass coin I’d glued on years ago from that trip I barely remembered.

I stood there for a second, like maybe I’d dropped it and forgotten. But that didn’t make sense.

I went back inside, opened my backpack.

The key was still in the front pocket. Exactly where it was supposed to be.

Now there were two.

 

I gave up on running.

The motel hadn’t helped. If anything, it had made things worse. made It clearer that this wasn’t about the house. Or the town. Or the distance I tried to put between myself and whatever this was.

It followed.

Toothbrush. Socks. Wallet. Even my notebook, though I never remembered taking it out of my coat. Everything kept showing up, carefully arranged around the motel room. Delivered. Presented.

I hadn’t lost any of them, not yet. That was the rule. They only arrived *before* they disappeared.

By the fifth morning, I checked out and drove home.

I didn’t unpack. Didn’t eat. I walked through each room like a tenant moving back into someone else’s life. Things felt the same, but wrong in the way shadows feel wrong when they fall in the wrong direction.

I didn’t go to bed. Instead, I lay down on the couch and pulled the old throw blanket over me. Not because I was tired. I wasn’t. but because I couldn’t imagine another night pretending to sleep in that room with the closet door that always seemed half-open.

The living room window looked out toward the side of the house. Just trees and darkness beyond. I left the blinds cracked, the room dim. Some part of me still thought I’d hear footsteps again. Maybe the knocking. Maybe worse.

I must’ve drifted off, because I woke up to a feeling. not a sound. A pressure in the air. Like the house was holding its breath.

I turned toward the window.

There was a face staring in.

Close. Inches from the glass.

It was mine.

Not a trick of light. Not a reflection. My face, outside in the dark, watching me. Same jawline. Same tired eyes. Same scar above the left brow, a bike accident when I was nine.

It didn’t blink. I did. And it didn’t.

For one suspended moment, we locked eyes.

Then it moved. Quick and quiet, sliding out of view to the left. Toward the front porch.

I scrambled to my feet, heart punching the inside of my chest. I didn’t even grab anything. I just went to the front door and yanked it open.

The porch was empty.

Except for one thing.

Wrapped in coarse fabric. Laid down carefully, like a final gift.

 

I didn’t touch it right away.

It was wrapped in coarse grey fabric, folded precisely, resting at the center of the porch like it had been waiting for me. Laying there like it had always belonged there.

I knelt and peeled the fabric back.

A plaque. Stone, or something close. Dark, pitted, cold to the touch. Too heavy to lift easily. I had to brace my legs, adjust my grip. The air felt thinner while I held it.

My name was carved into the surface.

**Jacob Davidson.**

Below that: two dates.

The first was my birthday.

The second was next weeks date. The 21st of October.

I set it down carefully.

Didn’t bring it inside.

I just stood there for a long time, watching the light shift across the surface of the stone.

Since then, nothing else has shown up. No more mugs, no more clothes, no more pieces of me.

That was the last item I ever received.

1lj4s03,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleephackers/comments/1lj4s03/i_fixed_my_broken_sleep_in_30_days_after_5_years/,I fixed my broken sleep in 30 days after 5 years of suffering with insomnia,"Last month I slept through the night for 30 days straight.

That might not sound like much, but I hadn't done that since 2019. For five years, I'd lie awake until 3am with my mind racing, then stumble through the next day like a zombie. I tried everything. Melatonin made me groggy. White noise machines did nothing. Meditation apps just gave me more to think about. I even bought a $2,000 mattress thinking that would fix it.

Nothing worked.

My turning point came from the most obvious place. I was complaining to my coworker about being exhausted again, and she said something that hit different: ""You're always on your phone right before bed. Maybe start there.""

I brushed it off. Everyone's on their phone before bed. But that night I actually paid attention to what I was doing. I'd climb into bed at 10pm, then scroll Instagram for ""just five minutes."" Next thing I knew, it was 12:30am and I was watching some random YouTube video about deep sea creatures, completely unrelated.

I realized I was basically doing stimulants before bed every single night.

So I tried something stupidly simple. I plugged my phone in across the room instead of next to my bed.

The first night was brutal. I just laid there, I was very bored and restless. Wanted to play video games hard. But by the third night, something clicked. I actually felt tired when I got in bed. By week two, I was falling asleep within minutes instead of hours.

Here's what I learned: my phone was training my brain that bed equals stimulation time. Every night I was conditioning my nervous system to be alert when it should have been winding down.

Changes I made that helped me:

Phone stays completely out of the bedroom. I bought a $10 alarm clock instead of using my phone. Best ten dollars I ever spent.

I read actual books again. Sounds ancient, but paper books make me drowsy in a way screens never did. Even just 10 minutes works.

I keep a small notepad next to my bed. When my brain starts spinning about tomorrow's tasks, I write them down and let them go. Gets the thoughts out of my head and onto paper.

The sleep improvement happened within weeks, but the ripple effects took time to show up. After a month of solid sleep, my anxiety dropped significantly. I stopped needing coffee at 3pm just to function. I had energy for the gym again. My relationship with friends improved because I wasn't constantly irritable.

I used to think insomnia was just part of who I was. Turns out I was creating it every night without realizing it.

If you're struggling with sleep, try moving your phone out of the bedroom for one week. Don't overthink it. Just see what happens. You might be surprised how much that one small change shifts everything else.

1lj4rqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1lj4rqw/i_think_ive_been_lying_to_myself/,I think I’ve been lying to myself,"Even typing this out feels incredibly weight lifting. 

I’m coming off a weekend with my dearest friends who I haven’t seen in well over two years. I truly feel like myself around these people, and am the most sincere version of me when with them.  

For context, I work on avg 72 hours a week in management for a large venue in hospitality and rarely get time off, including holidays (I love what I do and enjoy it daily, however it can be easy to get caught up in the workaholic culture), so this time was incredibly special and I was really looking forward to it. This was the first time I had taken off since I started with the company late last year. 

I was prescribed adderall in college, and to be honest had I been prescribed earlier in life, I once believed I would have been more successful. Looking back, all of my childhood “failures” were chalked up to not being able to sort out multiple tasks and being stuck on how to begin a task. Alas. 

Anyways, with my hours and the pressure mounting at work, pressure at home with significant other, I began doubling my dose, tripling my dose to coincide with the growing length of the work day. It became unsustainable and my mood swings were irrational. I was barely eating, consuming a cup of coffee in the morning, and a bottle of wine for dinner. I still don’t know how my body continued to function. 


Taking 5 days off, feeling like myself, not taking any adderall, laughing, and just enjoying life has me coming back to real life and work in such a different headspace. I feel like im hungry constantly, but joyous, and energetic. 

But theres there’s a huge piece of me that feels like I’ve taken off rose colored glasses on a glaring eating disorder. I feel like I’ve been lying to myself this whole time and let my depression trick me into wanting so desperately to be thin I convinced myself I had adhd to justify taking drugs that took away my ability to feed my brain the right way.

Be specific of what you want. 

Imagine what you want and believe you already have it. Imagine the feeling and satisfaction of achieving what you want as if you already have it. 

Let go of desperation and act like you already have it. (This is the hardest part) 

E.g. You wake up and the first thing you want is a coffee. You make yourself a cup of coffee. Would you still be looking around for cafes if you already had a coffee in your hand? 

Let the universe do its job. I get that inspired action is a thing, but you cannot expect the universe to manifest your desire in a certain way.

Went to a GP here in Australia the same day and they told me it was probably just a calf strain and to rest up. I had a gut feeling it was more serious, so I asked for an ultrasound. Came back as a full Achilles rupture.

Even then, the GP just referred me to a specialist and wasn’t too fussed if I got seen through the public system in the next couple of weeks. The pain was unbearable, so I looked up specialists in Melbourne and booked privately based on reviews.

Luckily, got my consultation on the 19th and surgery on the 20th. Had to pay around $10k AUD out of pocket, including hospital and meds. It’s really hit my bank hard.

My partner doesn't have any more leave left and she needs to go to work. Im off just for this week, elevating my leg 24/7...can’t even make a coffee on crutches, let alone anything else.

Since he told me this, I've been so paranoid about what I was tasting.  On my last, I thought that there might have been a hint of a raw potato taste but maybe it's just in my mind, because the coffee wasn't undrinkable.  He and other have mentioned, when you taste it, it is absolutely unmistakable.  But wouldn't this be determined by the ratio of affected : unaffected beans?

I’ve been living in Ubud for a few years now - solo at first, now with a small circle of expat/remote work friends. Ubud is **not for everyone**, but for the right kind of person it’s a dream. Here's what you should know if you're thinking about **staying here longer than a week** \- whether it's a month, a few months, or more.

# Renting in Ubud: Short-Term vs Long-Term

**Short stays (under 1 month):**

* Use Airbnb, [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Flokq to get started.
* Expect to pay **$25–70 per night** depending on quality, location, and amenities.
* Negotiate directly with hosts if you plan to extend — most will offer a 20–40% discount for a month.

**Medium/Long stays (1–6 months+):**

* Budget anywhere from **$350–$850/month** depending on comfort and area.
* Look on Facebook groups (like “Ubud Rentals”) and local Telegram chats.
* Best deals often come from walking around and asking locals directly.

**Check before signing:**

* Water pressure (yes, really)
* AC and fan
* Wi-Fi speed (ask for speedtest)
* Noise levels (roosters, ceremonies, construction)
* Generator for power cuts

# Where to Stay: Neighborhood Breakdown

* **Penestanan** – co-living friendly, social, walkable
* **Nyuh Kuning** – quiet, leafy, family-friendly, near Monkey Forest
* **Sayan** – more remote, amazing views, need a scooter
* **Central Ubud** – walkable to cafes but busy and touristy
* **Tegalalang/Petulu** – rural vibes, stunning but isolated

# Monthly Budget for Living in Ubud (Realistic Estimate)

Here’s what solo travelers or digital nomads typically spend:

* **Rent:** $350–650/month (private studio or simple villa)
* **Scooter rental:** $60–80/month
* **Fuel:** $10–20/month
* **Food:** $150–300/month (warungs + some Western spots)
* **SIM/internet:** $10–20/month
* **Coworking/yoga:** $50–120/month
* **Leisure/misc:** $50–150/month

So in total: **You can live comfortably on $800–1,200/month**. Less if you're frugal, more if you love nice coffee and massages (no judgment).

# What Life Feels Like Here

* Life moves **slow** — expect more reflection, less rush.
* **Easy to meet people** via yoga, coworking spaces, and community events.
* Health-focused culture: expect green juice, cacao ceremonies, and morning meditation.
* **Weather:** humid and green year-round. Rainy season (Nov–Mar) = intense showers, but still warm.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

* *“I’ll rent a scooter once I get there”* → Ubud has hills and traffic. Learn first.
* *“Rice field villas are always peaceful”* → Roosters, ceremonies, and bugs will surprise you.
* *“I’ll eat at cafes and still save money”* → Cafes are great but cost $6–12/meal. Warungs are $1.50–3.
* *“Ubud is quiet and zen”* → Not always. Choose your area wisely to avoid daily temple speakers and construction.

# Final Thoughts

Ubud isn’t for everyone - but if you're creative, curious, and okay with jungle chaos and spiritual charm, it can be a deeply rewarding place to live.

1lj4jdx,https://i.redd.it/iraizcclnt8f1.png,Rug size for my seating area -- how big is too big?,"Ignore the clutter. I have a small NYC apartment. Yes, I realize my sofa is large and disproportionate to the space! Function over form baby, once my apartment is set up I'll be lounging on it a lot, hosting people, etc. So I wanted the three seater.

I'm planning to get a coffee table and then get a rug to separate this spatially. Length wise (from the sofa to the wall against which the lamp is set) I plan to get something around 72""-84"" (I've worked out the math and probably want 63"" visible rug from the end of the sofa to 6"" from the lamp wall, how much the rug goes under my sofa doesn't matter to me).

I saw a cute 110"" x 80"" rug on marketplace that I liked. But the problem is 110"" is quite long. As you can see, the sofa is just 3"" from the window wall. I'd probably have a rug peek out 1"" into that 3"" (just so some floor and some rug are visible). The sofa is 86"", meaning 23"" of rug will be jutting out of the side towards the camera. Is that too much? Maybe I could get a pouf and put it near where the camera is?

Also, curious how big of a coffee table could work in this space. The sofa already feels quite large spatially, but I would love to be able to host some friends and play board games.

- forgets what he says every 10 mins then gets angry when you bring something up that he forgot about. 

- brings negative energy into the team everyday but long periods of silence and uneasiness. Feels uncomfortable to talk 

- complete silence at times and no team greetings on chat even when wfh

- doesn’t like me chatting to my female colleague (I am also female). Has brought it up before but the environment is extremely quiet so we make convo from time to time . Me and her get on v well and he hates it. 

- ignored me when I try to make convo or says get back to work. If he ignored I will say “hello did you hear me “. Very salty vibes from him.

- sometimes things are good but there’s always a turn with his moods and it seems aimed at me. I am almost equivalent to a team leader 

-told me privately doesn’t like me chatting “too much” to my colleague but will make convo whenever he fees like it . When I divulged into i and caught him out on a few things via email, he deleted it and said to me “ don’t be so daft you’re taking things personally” - was also nervous when he was talking to me 

- double standards. One minute it’s we must do this and help the client, the next it’s “too bad they can go elsewhere”

- Overall a moody person. At times he will be moody then go and make friendly conversation with another department 

- sometimes makes remarks about women

- dismissive at times with work feedback, and has a threatening tone over teams to my other colleagues e.g. “this better be fixed by the time I come back from Holidays “

- my other colleague called in sick last week and he came to work and told me and my female colleague that “ the little shit called in sick”.

- constantly making jokes or makes condescending jokes- if he sees me going for a coffee will look at his watch. Mind you, he yaps to people in the kitchen all day

There have been many occasions where he gets me gifts (not often) like the first time we celebrated my birthday together - he had gotten me the Dior Jadore perfume. 

I appreciate it because it’s not cheap but I am a HUUUUUGE perfume person and I’m VERY picky with my perfumes. He knows this. The only perfume I would wear from Dior is Blooming Bouquet. My 50 year old mom wears Jadore. Anyways, he did mention he still had the receipt and I could go change it for something else if I didn’t like it. Of course I went to get it exchanged and he was upset with me. 

Whenever he goes on work trips, he gets me random stuff like fridge magnets, notebook made out of elephant poo (from elephant sanctuary), a wallet made out of cork & a coin purse with a mirror attached to it (Portugal), lavender oil (Croatia). + I’ve also went to all these places and have seen them at typical tourist gift shops. Basically just very general gifts you’d get for a colleague at work maybe and in my opinion, I hate it when people gift me something with zero thought about what I would actually like or use - especially if it’s coming from my partner. At this point, I’d rather he not get me anything because the box in my room where I keep all of these things are getting full and I WILL NOT use them but I’m sure he’ll get upset if I throw them away. Put yourself in a position where you’re a coffee person but your partner ALWAYS makes you tea or everything else but a coffee. You appreciate the effort but it’s not what you like. 

Now, we’ve been together 2 years at this points and of course there’s very light talk about engagement and getting married etc. I told him if he ever wants to propose, I just want a thin band with a diamond and the wedding band can be a V shape that would fit perfectly with the proposal ring so I can wear them together on the same finger. I’d just like to disclaim that money is not an issue, he earns relatively well (USD80k yearly) so money to buy gifts are not an issue. But anyways, he proceeds to say that I don’t have a choice and I have to accept whatever he gets me. I tried to explain that I only have one proposal/ one marriage in a lifetime (hopefully) and I want it to be everything I’ve dreamed of - especially the ring that I’m going to have to wear every day. 

Why do I feel like he refuses to acknowledge what I like/ want so that I can enjoy these gifts better? Instead, he insists that I should always settle and accept everything he gives me. Of course you can only imagine how this problem pours into other parts of our relationship. I just don’t understand and I need another POV. Thanks in advance!",4,1750748567.0,AITAH,12,0.83,False

Hey r/DealsReddit and r/Shopping!  So, my old coffee table was… well, let’s just say it was less “stylish” and more “sad excuse for furniture.”  It was tiny, offered zero storage, and generally made my living room feel cramped.  I work from home a lot, and trying to use my laptop on the couch was a recipe for back pain. I needed a serious upgrade.

After weeks of searching (seriously, dozens of online and in-store options!), I finally found a coffee table that's actually amazing: a smart LED lift-top coffee table with hidden storage.  I'm genuinely impressed, and I wanted to share my experience.

The lift-top is the real MVP. It's super smooth; the top glides up and down effortlessly.  No more awkwardly balancing my laptop on my knees while trying to watch TV!  It's transformed my work-from-home setup. I can easily raise it to create a comfy workspace, then lower it when I'm done.  It's made working from the couch so much more enjoyable.  I've even started having dinner on it sometimes – it's surprisingly convenient!

The hidden storage is a game-changer (okay, I used that one, but it really is!).  It keeps my living room looking tidy. I can fit tons of stuff inside – blankets, extra remotes, board games, even some work stuff I don't need out all the time. Before, everything was piled up, making the space feel stressful. Now, everything has a place, and my living room feels so much more spacious and relaxing.  It's amazing how much a little organization can improve your mood!

Then there's the LED lighting. I wasn't sure about it at first, but it's become a favorite. The soft, ambient light creates such a cozy atmosphere in the evening. It's perfect for reading, watching movies, or just relaxing with a cup of tea.  It's subtle but bright enough to be useful, and it really elevates the look of the table.

The size is perfect for my living room – not too big, not too small. It fits comfortably without feeling overwhelming.  It's surprisingly sturdy too, even with the lift-top mechanism. No wobbling or instability here. The materials feel high-quality, and the overall design is modern and stylish – exactly what I was hoping for. It's really improved the look of my whole living room.

I did a ton of research before buying this coffee table, comparing prices and reading reviews. I even looked at some much more expensive options. But this one offers the best combination of features, quality, and price. I was a little hesitant about the price at first, but considering how much it's improved my daily life, it's been totally worth it.  It's a great value for the money.

I found mine on ursupermart.com, and the shopping experience was great. The website was easy to use, and shipping was quick.  If you're looking for a functional and stylish coffee table that will transform your living space, I highly recommend checking it out.  This coffee table has seriously improved my quality of life – less clutter, more comfortable workspace, and a more relaxing atmosphere.  It's one of those small changes that makes a big difference.

This coffee table is also perfect for smaller spaces. It's compact without sacrificing functionality. The hidden storage is a huge bonus if you're short on space.

Okay, Reddit fam, I've been on a serious mission to upgrade my living room.  My old coffee table was, let's just say, a sad excuse for furniture.  It was small, it lacked storage, and it definitely didn't scream ""stylish.""  I needed something that could handle my books, my ever-growing collection of board games, and my general tendency to leave things everywhere.  Plus, I work from home a lot, so a decent workspace was a must. I didn't want to be hunched over my laptop on the couch all day!

After weeks of searching – seriously, I looked at dozens of coffee tables online and in stores – I finally found one that's a total winner: a smart LED lift-top coffee table with hidden storage.  And I'm not just saying that because I'm excited about my new furniture.

First off, the lift-top is super smooth. It glides up and down effortlessly.  No more awkwardly balancing my laptop on my knees while trying to watch TV!  This thing is a lifesaver for my work-from-home setup. I can easily raise the top to create a comfortable workspace, then lower it when I'm done, leaving a sleek and stylish coffee table.  It's made working from the couch way more enjoyable. I've even started having my dinner on it sometimes, which is a nice treat.

The storage is a game-changer.  It's completely hidden, which keeps my living room looking tidy and organized.

Before, I had stuff piled everywhere, making the space feel cramped and stressful. Now, everything has a place, and my living room feels so much more spacious and relaxing.  It's amazing how much of a difference a little organization can make!

It's perfect for reading, watching movies, or just relaxing with a cup of tea. It's subtle enough not to be overwhelming, but bright enough to be useful. It really adds to the overall look of the table.

But honestly, this one offers the best combination of features, quality, and price. I think it's a great value for the money.

Okay, Reddit, I need to share something.  My living room was a disaster.  Seriously, a disaster.  Clutter everywhere, no good place to work from home, and just…blah.  It felt cramped and uninviting.  I'd been looking for a new coffee table for ages, something that would be stylish, but also *functional*.  I needed more storage, a better place to work, and honestly, something to brighten the whole space up.

I tried a few different things – those fold-up lap desks?  Nope, uncomfortable and awkward.  Extra storage bins?  Just made the room look even messier.  Then, I stumbled across this smart LED lift-top coffee table.  I was skeptical, I'll admit.  But the reviews were amazing, and the pictures...well, they looked pretty sweet.  So I took the plunge.


Let me tell you, this thing is a game-changer.  First off, the lift-top is fantastic.  I can easily raise it to create a mini-desk – perfect for working on my laptop, having breakfast, or even playing board games without hunching over the couch.  The weight capacity is surprisingly high; I've had my laptop, a full mug of coffee, and a notebook all up there without any issues.  It saves me SO much time; I can work comfortably from my couch instead of hauling myself over to my tiny desk, and that's been a huge stress-reliever.  And it’s so much more ergonomic than a lap desk!


Then there's the storage. It’s HUGE! There’s so much space underneath, enough for all my blankets, extra remotes, and a bunch of other stuff that used to clutter up the coffee table.  Seriously, it's like having an extra cabinet without losing floor space!  This alone has probably saved me about an hour a week in cleaning and tidying - I used to spend ages looking for lost remotes or blankets!


But the best part?  The LED lights. They're subtle but make such a difference.  They provide soft, ambient lighting, which completely changes the vibe of the room.  It feels so much more inviting and relaxing now, especially in the evenings.  It's also really practical, perfect for those times you don’t want to turn on a bright overhead light.


The dimensions are perfect for my living room.  It's not too big or too small, and it fits right in without feeling bulky.  This smart LED lift-top coffee table also looks amazing.  It’s so stylish and modern that it’s actually improved the overall look and feel of my whole living space! My friends have complimented it so many times!  I used to feel pretty self-conscious about how messy my living room was, but now I'm confident in showing it off.

I did a TON of research before buying this, reading tons of reviews, checking specs and comparisons. I even checked out a few competing models, but none had the combination of lift-top, storage, and LED lights – and honestly, it really is the perfect trio.  The other models either looked really cheap or didn't have nearly the same storage capacity.

This has honestly improved my life little by little.  I'm so much more organized, the space feels bigger, and I'm just generally more relaxed.  My productivity has also gone up—I'm getting more work done since working from the couch is actually now comfortable!  If you're like I was, struggling with clutter, limited space, and wanting a more functional and stylish living room, I highly recommend checking this out.

If you're curious, here’s the link to the exact one I got from ursupermart.com.  I got mine there because they had the best reviews and the shipping was surprisingly fast.

# Challenges In Coffee Pods Market

The market for coffee pods is laden with issues, mostly linked to environmental concerns regarding single-use pods. Increasing consumer awareness regarding the impact caused by plastic and aluminium pods is hastening pressure on manufacturers to actually formulate sustainable alternatives. The introduction of recyclable and compostable pods is still not in line with the reality since most of the coffee pods still contribute to plastic waste. Such centres among eco-conscious customers would ignite the interest of regulators. Another marketing challenge facing the coffee pod is that of stiff competition and price sensitivity. Still, many other brands continue to emerge into the arena at such a rate that it is beginning to sound like an among-the-few low-cost choices price-driving strategy. Thus, well-invented coffee brands across a variety of niches must provision themselves with distinctiveness, be it in quality, flavour variety, or convenience.

1lj4622,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1lj4622/26m_for_those_who_say_shoot_your_shot/,(26M) For those who say shoot your shot 🙂,"Girls often call me cutie and pookie because i speak very softly with them. but the hinge match told me ki cute ladkon ka ladkiyan dil tod deti hai. so its not good.

So, this year:

Majors:

1. Hinge match, calls me cute. Came home, had a hookup for few days and never came back. She said she wanted a relationship but we were like too different so i said i only want casual. she had just gotten out of a month long relationship (basically the guy slept with her and then ran away giving excuses) and i was the rebound ig. Still in touch, im like a big bro to her now.

2. Office girl. Giving me tons of hints. I started talking and she suddenly lost complete interest. Took hours and days to reply. We planned to meet on Saturday, didnt come and didnt even bother to message. I just said goodbye and left and never looked back. Completely done but hurts getting played.

3. Another from office. She was divorced very recently, HUGE amount of red flags. she said she wanted relationship but she was so self centered and manipulative, it was very difficult to talk at all. My go to weapon for separation is to ask that i only want casual. she actually went ballastic. i really dodged a bullet, completely stopped talking. 

4. Hinge again. Absolute sweetheart of a girl, we exchanged hearts on day1 and i fell so hard for her (she didn't as much). She calls me cutie and pookie a lot lot. Only problem is that she lives 1000+ km away. changed location to my city on app. she said i can decide if i want this to continue, i tried but it feels so frustrating living far away from the one you love. we're still talking but it's over. I'm heartbroken.

Minors:

1. Met a girl in random event. Super glued to me, wanted to go a bike ride with me at 2am. Im a dumb fuck for declining since i was super tired. Next we had lots of miscommunication regarding attending an event and fought. I'd say it's my fault completely 🥺. she was good looking and soft spoken. 

2. asked out a girl from hobby class. she said she's can't because she's engaged. Appreciate the honesty and sincerity ☺️.

3. Met a girl, very cute and bubbly. i was so performative around her, telling jokes and all. and earlier she used to notice and follow me around So i asked her out, she shot me down. we keep meeting and i was so smitten 🙂‍↕️ i asked her out 2 more times before stopping completely. stay away from her completely now. 

4. met another girl. she sounded super interested, asking me if i wanna come tomorrow to same place etc. i said yes. next day we came but she sounded completely different. i asked her coffee and she said no..ok i guess 🙂👍

5. From hobby class, she was so amateurish in hiding feelings its insane. Completely keeps staring at me in all classes to the point i got uncomfortable. Asked for my whatsapp and insta. I went on a dinner. I was so bland, she's very academic type and contemporary dance etc. i just couldn't wait to run away. Also said super creepy stuff like ""tum mujhe kahi bhi leja sakte ho, mujhe bharosa ho gya hai"". ""said ki she's feeling like a dinner and walk par jaane ka man kr rha hai"". main bahana bana kar bhag jata tha. 

Ultra Minor:

1. girl in office used to keep messaging me. we work in different departments. nothing to talk about. she just asks why i didn't came n all. She's MARRIED. i acted like im super dumb and not getting hints.

2. another girl in office. like all my stories. makes first convos n all. and she's super cute. but i just don't feel attracted at all. I just smile and play dumb for now. 

3. i added someone really random on ig. she said she likes me 😭😭 . kuch connection bhi nahi hai aise hi. i told her ki i am already in a relationship.

4-10 etc. asked for dates on hinge. got no/ghosted. sometimes yes but planned date aane tak we stop talking.


Writing all this made me realize maybe im blessed with looks. But i still feel super insecure like mujhe koi kyu ho pyaar karega. Ive never been in a long term relationship.

I have no history. used to live in a small town till an year ago. i get super jealous hearing about someone pasts. like i missed out on something. 

Also, im not a player (thats the only hookup or sex i ever had). 

What am i doing wrong?

Getting sufficient iron in a vegan diet is essential for maintaining good health, as iron plays a vital role in transporting oxygen in the blood. While plant-based sources of iron may differ from animal-derived sources, there are plenty of options available to meet your iron needs effectively.

To start, it's important to choose foods rich in non-heme iron, which is the type of iron found in plant foods. Legumes are one of the best sources. Incorporate beans, lentils, and chickpeas into your meals to easily boost your iron intake. For instance, adding kidney beans to salads, making a lentil soup, or blending chickpeas into hummus can be delicious and nutritious choices.

Nuts and seeds also provide a significant amount of iron. Consider snacking on almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds, or sesame seeds. These can be added to smoothies, oatmeal, or enjoyed on their own. Dark chocolate is another delightful option, offering both iron and antioxidants. Just a small piece can satisfy your sweet tooth while supporting your iron levels.

Whole grains such as quinoa, brown rice, and oatmeal can also contribute to your iron intake. Opt for fortified cereals that specify they contain iron, as these can be an easy way to increase your consumption. Pairing iron-rich foods with vitamin C sources like citrus fruits, tomatoes, or bell peppers can enhance iron absorption, making your meals even more beneficial.

It's advisable to be mindful of inhibitors such as phytates, found in grains and legumes, and polyphenols in tea and coffee, which can hinder iron absorption. To maximize the benefits, consume these foods at different times than high-iron meals.

Lastly, consider discussing with a healthcare provider about the potential need for iron supplements if dietary sources may be insufficient. With a well-planned vegan diet, you can easily obtain the iron your body needs for optimal health.

It’s mostly about the servicing of them - and the support I’d get with a new machine. But I see lots of reasonably priced options on eBay and it is tempting.

1lj42kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/1lj42kg/announcing_beeld/,Announcing beeld.,"# 🖼️ Introducing beeld: Because Your Images Have Stories to Tell

Hey r/Clojure! 

Ever wondered what secrets your photos are hiding? That camera model, GPS coordinates, or the exact moment you accidentally took 47 blurry shots of your coffee? Well, your images have been whispering their metadata all along – you just needed the right translator.

**Meet Beeld** (Dutch for ""image"" – because everything sounds more sophisticated in Dutch), a Clojure [library](https://github.com/danielsz/beeld) that's basically a metadata detective for your images! 🕵️

## What does it do?

Beeld extracts all the juicy metadata from your images – EXIF, IPTC, ICC, XMP, and even those sneaky manufacturer-specific Makernote tags that camera companies slip in like easter eggs. It's built on top of Drew Noakes's battle-tested metadata extractor, so you know it's solid.

```clojure
[com.github.danielsz/beeld ""1.1.2""]
```

## The Magic ✨

**Simple metadata extraction:**
```clojure
(require '[beeld.metadata :as meta])
(meta/tags ""path/to/your/image.jpg"") or (meta/tags ""https://somewhere.com/your/image.jpg"")

1lj4251,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingInIndia/comments/1lj4251/26m_for_those_who_say_shoot_your_shot/,(26M) For those who say shoot your shot 🙂,"Girls often call me cutie and pookie because i speak very softly with them. but the hinge match told me ki cute ladkon ka ladkiyan dil tod deti hai. so its not good.

So, this year:

Majors:

1. Hinge match, calls me cute. Came home, had a hookup for few days and never came back. She said she wanted a relationship but we were like too different so i said i only want casual. she had just gotten out of a month long relationship (basically the guy slept with her and then ran away giving excuses) and i was the rebound ig. Still in touch, im like a big bro to her now.

2. Office girl. Giving me tons of hints. I started talking and she suddenly lost complete interest. Took hours and days to reply. We planned to meet on Saturday, didnt come and didnt even bother to message. I just said goodbye and left and never looked back. Completely done but hurts getting played.

3. Another from office. She was divorced very recently, HUGE amount of red flags. she said she wanted relationship but she was so self centered and manipulative, it was very difficult to talk at all. My go to weapon for separation is to ask that i only want casual. she actually went ballastic. i really dodged a bullet, completely stopped talking. 

4. Hinge again. Absolute sweetheart of a girl, we exchanged hearts on day1 and i fell so hard for her (she didn't as much). She calls me cutie and pookie a lot lot. Only problem is that she lives 1000+ km away. changed location to my city on app. she said i can decide if i want this to continue, i tried but it feels so frustrating living far away from the one you love. we're still talking but it's over. I'm heartbroken.

Minors:

1. Met a girl in random event. Super glued to me, wanted to go a bike ride with me at 2am. Im a dumb fuck for declining since i was super tired. Next we had lots of miscommunication regarding attending an event and fought. I'd say it's my fault completely 🥺. she was good looking and soft spoken. 

2. asked out a girl from hobby class. she said she's can't because she's engaged. Appreciate the honesty and sincerity ☺️.

3. Met a girl, very cute and bubbly. i was so performative around her, telling jokes and all. and earlier she used to notice and follow me around So i asked her out, she shot me down. we keep meeting and i was so smitten 🙂‍↕️ i asked her out 2 more times before stopping completely. stay away from her completely now. 

4. met another girl. she sounded super interested, asking me if i wanna come tomorrow to same place etc. i said yes. next day we came but she sounded completely different. i asked her coffee and she said no..ok i guess 🙂👍

5. From hobby class, she was so amateurish in hiding feelings its insane. Completely keeps staring at me in all classes to the point i got uncomfortable. Asked for my whatsapp and insta. I went on a dinner. I was so bland, she's very academic type and contemporary dance etc. i just couldn't wait to run away. Also said super creepy stuff like ""tum mujhe kahi bhi leja sakte ho, mujhe bharosa ho gya hai"". ""said ki she's feeling like a dinner and walk par jaane ka man kr rha hai"". main bahana bana kar bhag jata tha. 

Ultra Minor:

1. girl in office used to keep messaging me. we work in different departments. nothing to talk about. she just asks why i didn't came n all. She's MARRIED. i acted like im super dumb and not getting hints.

2. another girl in office. like all my stories. makes first convos n all. and she's super cute. but i just don't feel attracted at all. I just smile and play dumb for now. 

3. i added someone really random on ig. she said she likes me 😭😭 . kuch connection bhi nahi hai aise hi. i told her ki i am already in a relationship.

4-10. asked for dates on hinge. got no/ghosted. 


Writing all this made me realize maybe im blessed with looks. But i still feel super insecure like mujhe koi kyu ho pyaar karega. Ive never been in a long term relationship.

I have no history. used to live in a small town till an year ago. i get super jealous hearing about someone pasts. like i missed out on something. 

Also, im not a player (thats the only hookup or sex i ever had). 

What am i doing wrong?

Crunchy and tasty - really good. This is my favourite bar out of all the ones I’ve tried. I hope they launch a version with 20g protein.

	2.	Double Cocoa 20g – 9/10
Tastes really good. Probably the safest pick among all the protein bars. Roasted almonds complement the cocoa well.

	3.	Coconut Cocoa 12g – 9/10
Surprisingly good! Tastes great and is easy to chew, unlike Double Cocoa. A bit oily, which is acceptable since it’s made with coconut oil.

	4.	Coffee Cocoa 14g – 8.5/10
Contains real coffee and has a strong coffee flavour. I literally felt like I had a cup of coffee - my energy levels were up, and I normally avoid caffeine.

	5.	Peanut Butter 12g – 8.5/10
Basically the healthiest version of Lonavala chikki, but made with whey protein. Tastes really good!

	6.	Double Cocoa 13g – 8/10
Has a nice chocolatey taste. It gets a bit gooey in the mouth, so it takes some effort to chew and digest.

	7.	Peanut Cocoa 15g – 8/10
Great taste and easy to chew. Simple and satisfying.

	8.	Hazelnut Cocoa 20g – 8/10
This is Ferrero Rocher on steroids! Hazelnuts are truly delicious, and when mixed with chocolate, they create a rich dessert-like taste. Quite expensive though.

	9.	Coffee Cocoa 20g – 8/10
Nice blend of coffee and cocoa flavour. The roasted nuts on top make it tastier and crunchy.

	10.	Peanut Cocoa 20g – 8/10
The top is loaded with roasted peanuts. The bar is a nice blend of cocoa and peanuts. Good stuff overall.

	11.	Peanut Millet Cocoa 13g – 7.5/10
Crunchy and easy to eat. The taste of peanuts didn’t work as well as in the almond millet cocoa, but it’s still a great option!

	12.	Cranberry 12g – 7/10

*June 16, 2025*

I'm 98.7% sure that I am not the AH here, but I'm wrong I'm willing to admit it and learn from my mistakes.

Our little boy will be one late this summer, so this was the first mothers day and fathers day for both me and my husband. My husband asked what I wanted for mothers day. I didn't want/need anything big or expensive. What I asked for is:

* For husband to get up with the little guy and get him fed while I pumped and chilled
* Breakfast in bed - just toast, scrambled eggs and coffee
* For us to take the little guy to the zoo for the first time. This was the main thing I was looking forward to.
* Go to my fav taco place for dinner

Between morning and afternoon naps we have about 4 hours of awake time. The zoo is abt 30 min away so I had figured if we left as soon as he got up from his nap and ate, we'd have a couple hours at the zoo and worst case he could sleep in the car on the way home.

We took my mom and my MIL out to brunch the prior weekend to celebrate them- his mom on Saturday and my mom on Sunday.  I also got them each a thoughful little present and flowers to celebrate their first mothers day as grandparents. I arranged everything and told my mom and MIL that we'd be celebrating on the actual day with just our little family and sent them a group chat (which included husband, my dad and FIL) just to make sure everyone is on the same page. My MIL is very pushy and overbearing so I didn't want there to be any surprises or confusion.

The Saturday before Mother's Day, FIL sent my husband a text with a picture of all the mulch he just had delivered and said something like ""gonna be a busy weekend!"" or something like that. Apparently he had 300 bags of mulch (they have a big yard with lots of flower beds). That night my MIL called my husband and asked him to come over first thing in the morning to help his dad move the bags of mulch to where they were going to be used. She said since we weren't going to the zoo until after little guy's nap, that husband could go over and help for a couple hours and then come pick us up to go to the zoo. I was obviously not happy but she guilted him and said FIL was going to end up hurting himself if he moved all that by himself and that its not a big deal and should only take an hour or two. I told him his mom was doing this to try and get us to skip our plans and spend the day with them but he kept saying it's not a big deal, saying his mom promised it would only take a couple hours, etc etc.

I think most people know what happened - husband went over first thing, which means no breakfast in bed and I had to get up to feed the little guy. I was kinda pissed, but whatever. Spent time with the little guy then when he went down for his morning nap I texted my husband to let him know he should start wrapping things up. Then when little guy woke up 2hrs later I called husband to tell him I'd be ready to go as soon as I finished feeding the little guy. He told me it was taking longer than he expected but that he'd hurry. Like an hour and a half later husband called and said they weren't done but he was getting ready to come home.  It's 15-20 minute drive from MIL/FILs house. At that point we'd missed the window to make it to zoo so I told him to just stay there and finish and not worry about Mothers Day since he hadn't done a single thing I asked for. I don't think there wasy any doubt in his mind how pissed I was. A little later his mom called and said since we decided not to go to the zoo, that me and little guy should go hang out with her while ""the boys"" finished with the mulch. I admit that I was pretty pissy and told her I had no interest in spending time with the people who decided to ruin my first mothers day. I ended up staying home and ordering a pizza and binging Netflix.

When husband got home he was all apologetic and asked how he could make it up. I was still pissed and told him he could make it up by not ruining my first mothers day. I also told him he should plan on spending Fathers Day with his mom and dad bc me and the little guy were going to go celebrate Fathers Day with my mom and dad.

Since Mothers Day MIL has been texting and calling but I've been keeping conversations short and just giving very bland generic responses.

My husband has been apologizing and asking what he can do but honestly I don't want to bother. I know it's just a day and we can celebrate any time, like we did with my mom & MIL. But it was my first ever Mothers day. And it's not like I asked for anything expensive or difficult. The only difficult thing is he's incapable of setting boundries with his mom. And she's incapable of considering anyones feelings but her own.

This past Saturday he asked if I was still going to my parents then said he'd like to go with us. I told him he could do whatever he wanted but since I hadn't done anything for his dad he might want to go see him or something. We did both end up going to my parents and spending the day with them. It was actually a nice day. My dad insisted on grilling because of course he did but the weather ended up being nice and we spent a lot of time hanging out on their deck playing with the little guy.

I'm not sure what if anything my husband did for his dad. I know he was getting a lot of texts during the day, I assume from his mom. She did send me a snippy text saying it was hurful to spend the day with my family at the expense of husbands but I told her she got to spend Mothers day with her baby boy so it's only fair that I spend Fathers day with my family.

I know my husband was hurt that we didn't acknowledge him for Fathers Day but I told him while we were driving to my parents house that I'm just matching his energy. I admit that I haven't done anything to de-escalate the drama but I'm still just so hurt he continues to prioritize his mom's feeling over our little family. This isn't the first time his mom has done crap like this and I'm just so tired of it. She always oversteps and insists on doing what SHE wants. I'm doing better at keeping her at arms length and holding my own boundries but my husband is absolutely incapable of it.

># Comments by OOP:

- 

Technically we've tried to alternate holidays or celebrate with one of our familys on a different day but his mom calls & texts nonstop if we spend a holiday with my family. I already told him this Christmas we are spending Christmas Day at home, just the three of us. That should be interesting to see what tricks MIL pulls out.

- 

I think I was trying to convince myself he'd come though for us. Lesson learned.

- 

To be fair, if I really wanted to keep him from our son, I would have gone to my parents without him. I expected his mom to guilt him into going over there for Fathers Day. And after what she pulled on Mother's day I wasn't going to reward her by letting her spend yesterday with our son.

- 

lol actually my mom & I get along really well. She can be overbearing and pushy too with the difference being when I tell her to back off she does. But she said the same thing a lot of people her are saying. That I'm justified in my feelings but if we end up going down this path we won't be married for long. She thought I should accept his apology and let it go and give him the chance to do better.

- 

My husband can suck sometimes, but generally (when his parents aren't involved) he's a good husband and good dad.

- 

We're both only children. But his mom is waaaaaayyyyyyy more invested in his life than either of my parents. My mom can be a pain, but when I ask her to stay in her lane she usually does.

- 

*[somebody says YTA because she did it on purpose and her husband didn't]* Even if I don't necessarily agree with comments like this, I still appreciate them. Reddit can be such an echo chamber sometimes, it's good to get different opinions and perspectives. But you do bring up something that has been a niggling thought which is why I posted in the first place. Because of our history and how often this sort of thing has happened before, I respectfully disagree with you. But just the fact it made me pause tells me it's a valid consideration.

- 

I think this was just the last one in a long line of this kind of behavior and really pushed me over the edge because it was so important to me. I did want him to have an idea about how he made me feel. I think it impressed on him how hurt I was. But you are right this isn't sustainable. I'm feeling like we both did some serious damage to our marriage and we need to figure out how to fix it.

- 

It's because this kind of thing has happened lots of times. But this time it ruined something that I thought was really important to me

*June 23, 2025, 1 week later*

I posted here last week, you can find it in my profile if you want the backstory. I wanted to thank everyone. I've had a lot of people asking for an update, so here we go.

This weekend the husband and I sat down and talked about everything. I expressed to him how incrediably upset and disappointed I was at how both Mother's Day and Father's Day went down. I really wanted to recognize and celebrate my husband for FD everybit as much as I hoped he would recognize and celebrate me for MD. He said he knew he shouldn't have gone to his parents on MD but didn't know what to do since his mom was pressuring him and saying if his dad got hurt it would be husbands fault. He admitted that he knew he messed up and has been terrified that I was going to ask for a divorce. 

Since he cut to the chase, I told him that if this is how our life is going to be, I don't want to stay married to him. I explained to him that I realized that while yes, I was upset about what happened on Mother's Day, that isn't what is making me feel this way. That was just the straw the broke the camels back. This kind of behavior from his mom has been happening since we before got engaged and has just escalated. This has been happening for YEARS. As someone here suggested, I had listed all the times/events (that I could remember) that she had overstepped or just completely ruined. For our freaking honeymoon, she called him TWICE A DAY. Every monrning to find out our plans for the day and then every evening to hear how the day went. Plus the constant texting, asking for pictures, telling him how much she missed him. I don't know how I thought this was acceptable. She tried to make our wedding about herself, tried to make my pregnancy about herself, tried to take over when we brought our son home, just constantly inserting herself and overstepping.

I told him that I don't really want to get divorced right now, but it's going to happen anyway, I'd rather get divorced now while we can still do it amicably. Because if nothing changes I'm going to end up so angry and resentful that it would make divorce very contentious and I don't want that for our son. At this point we were both crying, upset and emotional. So I told him that I'll give him some time to decide what he's going to do but if I don't see clear effort being made to start prioritize me and our son that I'd move forward with the divorce. And the change has to continue. Everytime we've fought about this in the past, he's promised he'll change and sometimes he has, but then his mom pulls him back into her orbit.

If we are to stay married - these are some of the things I'm insisting on in no particular order:

* We each own the relationship with our own parents. That means I'm not planning anything for his parents anymore. No cards, no presents, no burnches or parties, no pictures, nothing. If his parents reach out to me I'm going to redirect them to him.
* I'm not entertaining or visiting with his parents when he's not around. I'm not taking our son over to theirs by myself. And if they ""drop by"" I'm not inviting them in unless my husband is there.
* I'm not changing my plans at the last minute just because they decided to drop by without coordinating with us in advance or because they want us to do something with them.
* Neither of us makes plans with our parents or accepts invitations until we discuss with our partner. And if we don't both agree the we don't do it. And we don't throw each other under the bus, we just say something like ""we checked our schedule and we're not available"".
* Holiday's like Christmas, Halloween, Easter, etc are at our house. We can discuss inviting our parents but we're not going to someone else house to celebrate something involving our son when we can do it at home. This includes his 1st bday which MIL is trying to take over and plan.
* Other holidays we're alternate between our parents. And we will focus on being present. That means no more texting/talking to his mom non-stop when we're with my parents.
* No more oversharing with MIL. She doesn't need to know about our finances or health/medical issues or vacation plans or anything unless we both agree its something we want to share. 
* His visits to his parents can't be at the expense of spending quality time with me and our son. I don't mind him visiting his parents, but he's over there a couple times a week. We are his immediate family now, we should get priority. 
* We're not doing things just because she said we should. And we're not changing our plans just because she doesn't like them. She really doesn't understand that ""Wrong"" and ""Different"" are not the same thing. In her mind, if we're not doing what she wants, HOW she wants, then we are in the wrong. 
* He needs to go to therapy with someone specializing in emeshment. And we need to start going to couples therapy. I didn't even realize I have so much pent up resentment that I can't look at my husband the same anymore. I'm just angry at him all the time and I hate being this way.
* When it comes to our son, our word (husband and me) is law. If she disregards or minimizes our decisions for our son, then she looses access until she learns to behave.
* When me or my husband say ""No"" to either set of parents, the other person will support them and back them up. That means my husband has to stop trying to get me to agree with his mom all the time.

I can tell he's freaked out and really stressed about the idea of putting hard boundries in place or distancing from his parents. And I do feel for him. He said he feels like he's caught between a rock and a hard place and that me and his mom are both putting a ton of pressure on him and both have conflicting expectations. And that's fine. He just needs to understand that I'm not tolerating this anymore. I know this will cause an absolute shit storm with his parents but I feel like if we don't do it now, it'll just be harder down the road.

What does everyone think? Am I being unreasonable? Are there other boundries we should put in place?

># Comments by OOP:

- 

He did seem overwhelmed, and admittadly it is a lot. I wouldn't expect it all at once but this is where we have to end up and I have to see progress and change. I'll sit down with him again tonight and start having that conversation. I want him to be successfull. I want US to be successful. And I'm willing to put the work in and to also help support him, but he will need to do the same.

- 

I think his mom is at least partially responsible for some of his earlier relationships ending. I'll make sure to point this out!

- 

I feel like this is my last chance to try and turn this around. If it happens, that is on him. And I think it will just show that he'll never be ready or able to have an healthy, adult, romantic relationship.

- 

I would never allow my parents to act or treat him the way his act and treat me. If we do get divorced, at least I'll be able to say I tried my best and gave him every opportunity.

- 

What I was trying to say is if things are going to continue as they have been, I'd rather get a divorce. But, if he is willing to put the effort in to improve our marriage and make real change, then so am I. All my boundries apply to both of us, there is nothing I'm asking him to do that I don't already do (or aren't will to do) with my parents.

But yes, if he's just going to say ""Things will get better"" without trying to make them better, I'd rather just be done and get the divorce.

I absolutely don't want him to be my bi_ch. I know I can be hard headed and opinionated. And I want a partner that will call me out and stand up to me when it's warrented. And a partner that will support me and have my back when that is warrented. And I want to do the same for my partner.

- 

That is one of my fears. I don't want to have to be a nanny reminding him to behave and be a good husband/father. That's not what I meant to sign up for. If thats what ends up happening then this won't work out.

- 

I've always hesitated to do this because I didn't want to come off as a nagging wife, but I realize now I was just enabling the status quo. But you are right, we need to have some way of providing feedback to one another and being able to communicate in an open and healthy manner even if the underlying topic is toxic

- 

It was an absolutely brutal and heart wrenching conversation. I never want to have to do that again. But I'm terrified that he won't follow through and the next conversation will be even worse. I don't think we ended the discussion because we were done. We were both just to wrung out to continue. Also part of the reason I want couples therapy is becasue I don't want to have to do that alone again.

- 

I don't mind helping and supporting him. That's part of being married. I know he's going to stumble and trip sometimes. We all do. I'm not perfect, I'm going to screw up too. And I'm happy to help him. But I can't do it for him, he has to want to make a change. And if he does, I'll be there. And if he doesn't, then that's a whole different conversation.

- 

It's not just that she called everyday. It's that he answered the damn phone even when I got upset and told him I thought it was ridiculous.

- 

And I'll be honest - what really really pisses me off not is that I didn't make a bigger deal. It pissed me off, and I told him it pissed me off, but I never followed through. I just let him say things like ""she's excited for us"" or ""she misses us"" and the next time she called I'd roll my eyes and say something passive aggressive then when they hung up we'd carry on with what we were doing. I should have been more explicit that I didn't think it was acceptable. I'm not saying I expected no contact - I texted my parents when we landed at our destination, and then again when we were on the plane to go home. But that was it. And their only response was ""have fun"" and ""have a safe flight, can't wait to see you"".

And I see my folks probably every 2-3 weeks and they live about the same distance as his parents. So I don't have a problem with him going to visit. But that often? Really?

- 

Because I was young and stupid and really believed that ""love conquers all""? Because I really believed once we got married he'd stand up for us? Then I really believed once we had kids he'd make us his priority.

Trust me, these are all thoughts I've had. And now I'm in the situation where I have a son, that I love more than anything. So I can't wish I had left because I'm so grateful for my son, but I also can't stay anymore if this is going to be my future.

Right now, how I ended up here is an interesting academic question. Answering it won't fix this, although maybe it will help me avoid being in a similar situation if we get divorced. The important questions are can this be fixed, and how.

- 

*[somebody comments she seems to have the same character as MIL and to let MIL have some things]*
We've been together 8 years, married 5, and our son will be 1 later this summer.

My whole point is I'm trying to keep her from ruling my house. She doesn't want to be ""a part"" of anything, she wants to own and run everything the way she wants. The reason I listed all these rules as you call them is because these are all areas where she has completely ignored what we want and imposed her will on us. I can't tell you how many times we've had plans that she insisted on us cancelling or changing or including them on. And yes, he SHOULD have said no but whenever he's tried she pushes and guilt trips and threatens until he gives in.

Did you read my first post about what happened on mothers day: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ld5j35/aitah_for_not_planning_anything_for_fathers_day/ ?

That kind of thing is entirely typical of her and her behavior.

Which of my rules do you think is unfair or unreasonable? I'm asking because I'm really curious. I feel like all these are things in a normal marriage you'd just have a conversation about and decide where to go for the holiday or whatever. But that's never worked with her, if we don't do what she wants, how she wants, when she wants, then she starts with the manipulation.

Do you really think it's ok that she called him twice a day for our honeymoon? or that she texted him constantly? or that when we are doing a holiday at my parents she keeps calling and texting? or that when we plan a trip she convinces him we shouldn't go? Or that she tricked him into spending mothers day at her house and skipping all the plans we had made?

I think if my MIL and my husband had a normal, even slightly healthy relationship, you'd be right. But I honestly think she sees him as an extension of herself and not a full grown individual who can make his own choices and live his own life.

- 

If my husband wants to tell his mom about his health, that is entirely his choice. But why does he need to tell her about my health/medical issues/Dr appointments/etc? Why does she need to know how much I earn or how much I have save up or how much I paid for my car or any of that? How is that her business? If we decide to take a trip why do we need to tell her how much we're spending?

And why does visiting her take priority over plans we made? I can't count the number of times we were doing something together where he bailed because she needed help with something stupid. Or the number of times plans got canceled because suddenly she wants him to come over.

If he wants to devote all his time and effort to his mom that is absolutely fine. But he can't do that and still be an involved father or engaged husband. What happens when our son is older and my husband has to choose between attending his school events or games or whatever. Because yes his mom won't be around forever, but our son won't be a child forever. What happens in 18 years when our son goes to college and my husband realizes he missed seeing him grow up because he was busy catering to his mom.

And I won't be a third wheel in my own marriage. I won't spend my marriage wondering what plans she is going to screw up or what decisions we make that she's going try and override.

It's not about sharing info or visiting. It's when those things happen to the extreme and impact our life as a married couple.

Recently my machine starting spluterring water out of the hot water faucet, I assume it's a limescale issue and planned to clean it this weekend (it started last week but I've not had the time to give it a deep clean), but yesterday and today now I've not been able to get the pressure gauge to move past the first two small bars.

Yesterday I had the end of a KG of fresh coffee, inner bur size 3 and outer set to 3 which on mine is closer to fine than course.

Today I've used a bag of old beans my girlfriend got from her work, still decent quality, just not freshly roasted, due to this ive taken the inner bur out, set it to 1 (finest) and then set the grind size on the outside to 3 as well and still the same issue, even with not freshly roasted coffee, this level of grind size should produce pressure?

Is my machine cooked? Do I just need to descale the whole thing?

I regularly change my filters and run the cleaning program so I don't feel like it would have died on me but I am sick of googling this as it's such a specific problem and every answer is just ""Change bur size"".....Which obviously at this stage isn't helpful.",1,1750746334.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

After a month or 2 I began having feelings for her...and it hurt me to have those feelings cause she stated when we first talked she wasnt ready relationship (I know, her being in a dating app but not wanting a relationship is something). 

Day and day out i would comfort or help her in anyway I can, cause reality speaking she didnt have much she just recently ran away from LA cause of her ex which she had nothing but debt as a friend. 

She has her girl Bsf but thats it, so I helped her out with bills (it was my decision not her and she did occasionallyoffer to pay me back but i said its fine), making sure she ate and also the occasional coffee that she wanted, it gave me a smile....a warm one..cause ever since I met her my life has been more lively and I loved that but I already knew deep down she genuinely wouldnt say yes to being in a relationship with me. 

Its been an entire 4 1/2 months now and I helped her through a lot...and my feelings are still there burning strongly...but also gnawing away at my mental state, she already knew about my feelings cause I was opened about it cause she was my first crush, but she rejected me saying she couldn't love me more than what she can already because she doesnt wanna risk losing me (her past ex was her everything in which she got over him but still cant date anyone cause of it, which I understand and I can never replace him), so I said im alright being friends even tho I was crying hard at work, hitting the wall till my knuckles hurt lying to her i will slowly over my feelings for her. I just dont know what too do anymore every day I talk with her I worry about the thing she does that shouldn't make me worried and my feelings still there worse than before...I wanna tell I cant anymore I cant be her friend.

In my teens I had a couple of friends in school but I was never close with them because I didn’t drink or party and that’s all they did. So I was always missing out and essentially we grew apart and I wasn’t invited to anything anymore. When I started university I thought now was finally the right time and I was going to make friends with similar interests but then covid happened. And when covid ended I started my masters degree with all new people. I really tried putting myself out there, going up to people and starting conversations, I’ve also had people coming up to me and starting conversations with me but somehow it never ended in any friendships. Now there’s this one girl who always talks to me after class and I really like her and thought that maybe we could be friends. We also started walking to the bus together and we shared some more personal stuff or well at least I opened up. Today we had class together again and I wanted to chat with her as this has somewhat become a habit for us and I was walking up to her, got interrupted by my professor, but I could hear in the background that she invited two other girls (with whom I never really see her talking much to) for coffee. When I talked to her, I thought she might invite me too but it never happened. Later I texted her and asked what she was doing the day she invited those girls for coffee to see if maybe she would invite me too as we all have the same class that day. But she just said she was busy, so she clearly doesn’t want me there. I know this all sounds kinda pathetic but it’s just so frustrating because why does this always happen to me (similar things happen all the time)? What am I doing wrong? I’m friendly and I’m not pushy. Am I giving off a weird vibe? I really don’t get it cause they chat with me but they never invite me to anything and when I initiate something, they give weird responses. I know I have my family and boyfriend and I’m not lonely but I’m not going to lie, it would be nice if I had a few girlfriends as well. And I’m kinda frustrated cause at this point I really just want to know what I’m doing wrong.
