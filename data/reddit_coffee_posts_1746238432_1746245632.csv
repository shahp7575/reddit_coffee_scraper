1kdkaxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1kdkaxu/hes_hit_me_and_expects_me_to_be_grateful/,He’s hit me and expects me to be grateful,"Me (23f) my boyfriend (22m) met me a year and a half ago I was working in a strip club. I was in a hard time in my life and we started hanging out and he wanted me to be his girlfriend. He’s very religious and wants a traditional marriage & “change my life around” he’s in college currently and I just graduated from school to become a esthetician. Things turned bad when he started to say little insults to me. We went to visit his parents in Canada and that’s when he first put hands on me when he thought I was ignoring his mother, when I actually couldn’t understand because her first language is polish. So I didn’t even realize. He took me into the garage and smacked me across the head 3 times each time being harder and I fell to the ground on the 3rd smack. His brother ran inside and it was a huge fight between the whole family over what happened. I ended up brushing it off later & so did his family. Then we got home to the states and the hitting continued. I remember I spilled coffee on a notebook I had that had a saying about God on the cover and he freaked out ran up to me and smacked me with it. I was crying hard, & we then went to church 30 minutes later and I was balling my eyes out. The hitting never stopped during big arguments he still does it, he’s even choked me before really hard but claims it wasn’t “hard hard” he calls me stupid all the time and wants to have a traditional relationship and marriage and I wanted that at first until the abuse and extreme controlling behavior started to happen, now I think if I were to eventually marry him it would be like putting hand cuffs on. He doesn’t like “independent career woman” he HATES them. Now I realize it’s because they most likely wouldn’t be as easy to control and abuse in his eyes. He molded me into being who he wants me to be and take anything he does to me, because he viewed me as easy to manipulate because he met me in a vulnerable state. He said he’d go to clubs all the time before me trying to find a girl to make his “wife” so it all makes sense now. We live together now and I don’t know how to leave and move forward because I’m getting tired of being around him. I’m very argumentative and toxic verbally during fights and he says that justifies him hitting me. He’s choked me once during an argument and was saying “die , die just die” and his eyes were so scary. But I keep telling myself well I was super mean and acting so crazy that it it’s ok. He will get me extremely upset by saying terrible things then pull out his phone and record me freaking out and crying & threatens to show them to police to show I’m “unstable” whenever I say I want to call the police after he hits me. I can’t ever bring the abuse up or he will gaslight me or say I’m bringing up something that happened a while ago & I’m repeating it wrong. But I remember every detail so clearly. Every single insult every single hit, everything.",1,1746245517.0,domesticviolence,0,1.0,False

# ChaSity the ChaRity Case

The blanket of pure white snow seemed to sparkle in the early morning light. The Pack House was buzzing with excitement about the upcoming festivities. Tomorrow was my birthday, not that anyone cared or even remembered because it was also the birthday of the Thorn Triplets. The Thorn Triplets were the pride and joy of the Winter Moon Pack. They were the sons of Alpha Romeo Thorn. They were filthy rich, devilishly handsome and disgustingly arrogant. All the young she-wolves adored them wholeheartedly and stroked their egos on a daily basis. I was cursed to share a birthday and a home with them.  
  
At the tender age of nine, my parents left the pack to go rogue and had not been seen or heard from since. They left no instructions regarding their wishes for me so I was taken into the pack house under the care of Alpha Romeo and his wife, Ronnie. As if I had not been devastated enough, I now had three twelve-year old tormenters. The identical triplet sons of the Alpha were, in order of birth, Alex, Felix and Calix. They despised me and ensured that I knew I was beneath them. My parents had incurred a huge debt. Thus, I had to earn my keep and repay my debt by doing as many chores as possible while the triplets enjoyed an idyllic childhood in the very same house.   
  
In some packs the new Alpha ascends at age eighteen when they first shift but in mine, the age for ascension was twenty one. Thus tomorrow, on November eleventh, the triplets would turn twenty-one and take over the pack while I would turn eighteen and experience my first shift. Eighteen was also the minimum age when werewolves found their fated mate but I did not care about that. All I wanted was to come of age so I could leave this hell behind.  
  
At least, the pack house had beautiful scenery. We were close to the north pole so snow was an everyday affair though there was no sign of Santa Claus. I certainly did not expect any birthday presents this November or Christmas presents come December. The pack made it clear that I owed them money and they were subtracting everything they did not spend on me from the huge debt. They also subtracted my “wages” from the debt so I was never given any money. I was allowed food, clothes and shelter, the basics.   
  
I slowly got out of bed. The sun was just peeking out from behind a snow-covered horizon. Everything glistened. I gazed out my window at the wintry terrain. I sighed. I had to start making breakfast for everyone. Despite the huge size of the pack house with its luxurious bedrooms and bathrooms, I was given a small empty storage room to stay in. I had a cot, a shelf of second-hand books and a single drawer full of second hand clothes. The other drawers contained extra cleaning supplies as I did the housekeeping work also.   
  
I used the common room’s bathroom, showering quickly. I looked at myself in the mirror. My parents had name me Chasity but everyone in the pack called me Charity. This was started by the triplets as a joke and because they said it so often, even decent pack members thought it was my real name. I was so shy and scared as a child that I never bothered to correct them so it had stuck.   
  
I detangled my waist-length dark blonde curls and put them up in a huge bun. Whenever I left them down the triplets would pull my hair ever since we were little. They had not grown out of this habit even in adulthood. I sighed. There were dark circles forming under my large brown eyes. My light brown skin looked sallow. I had been overworking myself or rather the Thorn family had been overworking me. They used to have a maid and a cook with me as the sole assistant of both, but they had fired them last month after numerous conflicts between them and the spoilt triplets. For the past month, I had been drowning in work while attending my final year of high school. I had seven more months of high school before I could leave this place. That was the deal. At eighteen and after high school, I got my freedom and whatever I had paid off by then would be the end of it. The current Alpha and Luna seemed to think they were being extremely generous.  
  
The pack house had a really good heating system so despite the fact that outside looked like the frigid tundra, inside was pretty warm. I put on a long-sleeved white babydoll top that covered my behind as I was wearing just black leggings underneath.  I started on breakfast. As it was the Triplets’ “birthday week” and they would soon be Alphas, everyday was a feast day. I made waffles, pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs and sausages. I put the butter and maple syrup on the table. I made coffee. I quickly drank some sweet, milky coffee for some energy and started setting the table.  
  
Luna Ronnie entered the dining room, eyeing me, scrutinising my handy-work. She was a tall woman with dark brown long straight hair, pale skin and green eyes.  
  
“The table looks nice,” she said, a rare compliment. “But have you washed all the wares? Wash them all before you eat!”  
  
Alpha Romeo sauntered in, kissing his Luna gently. He nodded in approval at the breakfast spread. I smiled feebly at him. I heard heavy footsteps on the stairs and I took a deep breath. The Triplet Terrors were coming. They towered over me at six feet and four inches each, exactly a foot taller than me. They resembled their father with their shoulder-length thick shiny black hair, chiseled faces, baby blue eyes, dimples and chin-clefts. As they were Alphas they were all broad-shouldered and muscled blessed with super speed and super strength even beyond what was considered extraordinary for a werewolf. They were perfectly identical and perfectly heinous or at least they were to me. Their deep voices boomed as they shouted excitedly, shoving each other playfully. They would be twenty-one tomorrow but they still acted like they were twelve.  
  
Alex was the eldest and the most serious and severe. He would surely rule with an iron fist and a surly demeanour. Felix as the middle triplet loved being the centre of attention and was naturally filled with wise-cracks, jokes and quips. Classic middle child. The youngest, Calix, was the charmer, a professional sweet-talker and Mommy’s favourite. He almost treated me like I was human.  
  
“Did you make all of this, Charity?” Asked Calix, immediately trying to pull my hair out of its bun. I nodded, dodging him, only to bump into Felix who smirked and slipped my hair tie off. My curls tumbled down all around me. Felix and Calix laughed.  
  
“Stop!” I implored them, reaching for my only hair tie. Felix held it high above my head. He threw it to Alex who caught it and put it in his pocket. I tried to lunge towards Alex but Felix grabbed me. Felix and Alex started shoving me back and forth between them like I was a ball and they were playing catch.  
  
“I give up! I give up!” I said while they snickered.  
  
Calix said, “All right. Cut it out. Let her go wash the wares. Mom wants the place kept as clean as possible so there’ll be less to do tomorrow.”  
  
The elder two relinquished me. I ran into the kitchen. My heart was racing. I started on the dishes. By the time I was done, the family of five hungry werewolves, four of them from Alpha stock, had devoured literally everything I made except for one pancake. The chairs were all empty. I went to get the last pancake but Felix snatched it up. He had zoomed in out of nowhere, fast as a cheetah and quiet as a mouse.  
  
“I haven’t eaten anything,” I told him, my eyes wide.  
  
“Good, you’re fat enough as it is,” he said, sneering. He ate the pancake in two bites.  
  
I sighed. I refused to cry. I had not cried in front of them since the first year of torment when I was nine. My tenth birthday marked a very important vow I had made to myself after crying almost every single day at aged nine. The vow was that I would never let the Triplets make me cry ever again. I would be strong. I had kept that vow successfully for eight years come tomorrow. The comment stung though. The Triplets were widely regarded as the most handsome eligible bachelors in the Pack. They constantly attacked my weight. I was not overweight but I had a curvy hourglass figure. My waist was slender. I wore about a size 4 in clothes which was small enough in my opinion but all the Triplets had stick-thin size 0 girlfriends.  
  
I had to take the bus to school. I had thrown on a man’s black coat over my white top and leggings, another hand-me-down. I managed to find another hair tie but this was truly the last one. The Pack high school was called Winter Moon High after the pack. Our pack colours, and therefore also the school colours, were white, blue and silver. The whole school was decorated with streamers and balloons in celebration of the new Alphas, the Triplets.  
  
“You’re so lucky, Charity,” said Mina Toros, the most popular girl in my senior year. She tossed her long dark hair back and pursed her plump red lips in her locker’s inside mirror. She was wearing a pink skirt short enough to qualify as belt. Thank goodness she had opaque tights on underneath. She usually ignored me except for the occasional pronouncement of how “lucky” I was.  
  
“The things I’d to those Triplets if I lived in that house,” Mina said, licking her lips.  
  
“You’d have to drop out!” Squealed her best friend, the second most popular girl, Tina Gregory. “You’d get pregnant the first month there.”  
  
Tina had flawless dark brown skin with curly hair. She was tall and waif-like and also wore a pink skirt short enough to be a belt with opaque tights. Mina and Tina usually matched as though they were twins. Mina cackled at Tina’s joke.  
  
“You know, Charity,” said Mina suddenly. “You’re not totally hideous.”  
  
Gee, thanks.  
  
“Ok,” I said, clutching my books. The girls were blocking my locker which was sandwiched between their two lockers. Lucky me, indeed.  
  
“Yeah,” agreed Tina. “Your hair is actually pretty. You’re like a biracial Goldie Locks.”  
  
I smiled. That sounded like a real compliment.  
  
“Thanks Tina!” I said.  
  
“Ohhh! And those Triplets are the three bears!” Shrieked Mina. “If I were their Goldie Locks I’d make sure everything was just right, get it?”  
  
“Or too big,” said Tina, giggling.  
  
“That means one of the triplets has to be too small,” I said softly.  
  
Being werewolves, Mina and Tina heard me and they burst out laughing. Wow. I was actually getting along with them for five minutes.  
  
“That was a good one, Charity, surprising,” said Tina, looking at me like she was now seeing me for the first time.  
  
“Yeah,” said Mina giving me the same strange appraising look. “You know, if you had the money, imagine how cute you could look.”  
  
I fidgeted uncomfortably, suddenly hyperaware of the patches in my clothes. Mina and Tina strutted off and I hurriedly opened my locker and got out my Math book. Mr Johnson who coached football and taught Math looked like he should be an Alpha too. He was huge and really attractive for a teacher. He was married though to his mate, the Art teacher, Mrs Johnson. He handed out our graded tests while Tina and Mina made flirty faces at him. Those flirty faces were not doing them any good. I noticed they got an F and an F minus respectively. I did not know F minus existed before today. He smiled at me and winked. My heart skipped a beat. “A plus as usual Math champ,” he boomed. Mr Johnson was one of the few people in my life who was nice to me.   
  
“Mina and Tina, see me after class,” Mr Johnson said.  
  
After class, Ashton Peters, a tall buff redhead who played football and was well-liked in the pack, pretended to knock into my desk.The stack of papers on my desk went flying all over the room. Mr Johnson spotted it.  
  
“Stay and help her pick those up, Aston, my boy,” boomed Mr Johnson.  
  
“Aww, coach, I’ll be late for football practice,” he whined.  
  
“And we’ll be late for cheerleading practice,” said Mina and Tina in unison, pouting.  
  
“I’m the coach, Aston, go ahead and be late. I’ll explain to your cheerleading coach ok, girls,” said Mr Johnson.  
  
Ashton grumbled. He glared at me as if this were my fault. He started picking up papers at werewolf speed which cause the ones I was picking up to fly around due to the displaced wind. I eavesdropped on the meeting with Mina and Tina.  
  
“Mina, Tina, I’m giving you a homework assignment to make up those grades. If you don’t ace it there won’t be any cheerleading,” he said.  
  
The girls gasped. He handed them a stack of papers each and told them they could work on it together and that he set the questions himself so they would not find the answers online. I snatched up the last few papers from the floor and took the stack Ashton was handing me without looking at me.   
  
“Thanks,” I said softly to him.  
  
He glanced down at me, surprised by my thanks. He looked a little guilty all of a sudden. Mr Johnson left the room, leaving Mina and Tina  looking dejected. Ashton grabbed the hair tie from my hair just like Calix had this morning. My curls came tumbling down again. I shrieked. I was so fed up. Ashton laughed and ran away to football practice. There went my last hair tie and my birthday was tomorrow.  
  
“Aren’t you going to cheerleading?” I asked the girls, actually feeling sorry for them as they had been sort of nice earlier.  
  
“No,” said Mina.  
  
“What’s the use. We’ll never ace this homework so we’ll fail the class and be banned from the squad anyway,” explained Tina.  
  
I walked up to them and looked at the homework assignment. I snorted. I could get 100% in this in my sleep. I was suddenly struck by an idea.  
  
“Remember how you girls said I had…potential,” I said, looking at them.  
  
They shrugged.  
  
“I’ll do the assignment and you copy it over in your handwritings and ace it ok,” I offered.  
  
The girls squealed. They jumped up hugging each other and me.  
  
“Wait!” Said Mina, raising her eyebrows.  
  
“What’s the catch?” Asked Tina, narrowing her eyes.  
  
“I’m turning eighteen tomorrow too,” I said.  
  
They gasped.  
  
“You have the same birthday as the triplets?” Mina asked.  
  
“Wait that means everyone ignores your birthday like every single year,” said Tina.  
  
It was my turn to shrug.  
  
“And they will this year too but I at least wanna feel…special. I’m gonna shift for the first time at midnight and who knows…I might see my mate at the big party…not that I care…” I rambled.  
  
“You wanna look hot! Is that it?” Mina said smirking.  
  
“Yeah you want us to make you over?” Tina asked, smiling.  
  
I nodded.

# Chapter 2: Makeover!

  
  
I was supposed to go home immediately after school to help with the preparations for the huge birthday party tomorrow night for the Triplets but I had to do the assignment for the girls and they had to make me over. I knew I would pay for it later but whatever. The Thorns had hired a party planner. They should be okay for a few hours without their werewolf Cinderella.  
  
I did the assignment for the girls literally in the car on the way to the mall. It was that easy. Math was my thing. I was a nerd in general and I was proud of this even though werewolves prized brawn and beauty over brains any day.  
  
The girls were impressed. They quickly copied it over sitting in the freezing car parking lot with the heater turned up. Mina drove a sports car. I did not know what kind but I knew that Mina and Tina were almost as rich as the Alpha and his family. They dragged me into the mall, squealing excitedly as though I was doing them a favour even when it came to the makeover. I reminded them I had no money. They rolled their eyes and ignored me. I guessed I could consider the stuff they bought as part of the deal.   
  
I tried on outfit after outfit. Mina and Tina rated each one and seemed to having a blast. This was actually kind of fun. They encouraged me to pick out a lot of miniskirts and mini dresses. They said I had “great legs” even though the Triplets called me fat. Honestly, the clothes they picked for me did look great. I had some trouble walking in heels but the girls made me practice in the store like it was a runway. They pretended to be on a catwalk too. They were so confident. I had to marvel at them. Next they showed me what makeup to wear and how to style my hair at Tina’s house. They did a test run. I looked in Tina’s floor-length mirror and my jaw dropped.  
  
I had on high heeled black ankle boots with a mini pleated black skirt. I was wearing black stockings as it was cold out even for a werewolf. My long-sleeved white top had a sweetheart neckline that was really flattering. My hair was so shiny in loose bouncy curls down my back. My skin glowed and I had cat eyeliner and red lips that surprisingly suited me. I hugged Mina and Tina. Did I just make two friends?  
  
They drove me to the pack house hoping to catch a glimpse of the triplets but they were not at home yet. Thank goodness! I started helping the party planner sort out all the decorations and the food. It was tomorrow night but there was a lot to do. I did my own homework in between all of this. I was a master multitasker. I heard three cars parking. It was the triplets. Alpha and Luna were out shopping for even more gifts despite the fact that I had already wrapped like a dozen gifts. The party planner was a bleached blonde in her thirties who was obsessed with the hunk-i-ness of the triplets. She seemed to dislike me even though I was the only one helping her. She had been over everyday this week and always tried to make me look bad in front of the triplets. I wanted to tell her that they already hated me so she could relax. Her name was Ronda Something. I kept forgetting her last name.  
  
The triplets walked in. Each had their arm around a girl. They had different girlfriends every two months or so. It did not make sense learning the girls’ names. Also, the triplets were anxious to find their real mate. They were not sure if they had three separate mates or just one mate to share. Sounds crazy but when it came to identical multiples like twins and triplets, they usually shared a single mate since they had been one egg and one sperm that split to form the multiples. So theoretically identical twins and triplets were naturally occurring clones. Every girl wished she was their mate. That was so crazy to me. The triplets were handsome but they were awful and three mates sounded so complicated.  
  
Ronda glared at their girlfriends, jealousy evident in her beady eyes. The girls did not stay long and when they left, Ronda told the triplets I had showed up really late to help her. I sighed. I had been under the table literally as I wrapped tiny presents for door prizes. All the pack members got to pick a mystery present from a huge box tomorrow.   
  
I crawled out from under the table to make myself known before they had to look for me. Hiding from them would just set them off. The triplets stared at me, their eyes wide. They looked at each other. I remembered my makeover. I did not think they would notice or even care. Alex licked his lips, trailing his eyes from my head to my toes. I took a step back. Felix looked flabbergasted and Calix smirked at me.  
  
“Leave it to us, Ronda,” said Felix, recovering his usual haughty sneer, “We’ll punish her.”  
  
Ronda smiled maliciously at me. She was the most immature adult I had ever met including the triplets and that was saying something. The triplets had me backed against the kitchen island.  
  
“I’m sorry,” I said, “I had to do some extra math for Mr Johnson.”  
  
It was not a complete lie. The triplets knew Mr Johnson because they were his football stars back when they went to High school. They also knew I had won Math competitions before. They had really enjoyed making fun of me then.  
  
“Ok,” said Felix simply. He took a step towards me. “What’s all of this?” He gestured to my outfit, makeup and hair.  
  
“My eighteenth birthday is tomorrow too. I’m just trying out how I wanna look,” I said, looking down, waiting for them to insult me or call me fat.  
  
“Do you have a boyfriend, is that it?” Asked Alex, anger rising in his voice.  
  
Why did he even care?  
  
“I’m too fat to get a boyfriend, remember?” I said, repeating one of their classic insults.  
  
“Don’t play games with us,” said Felix softly. “Is all of this for your mate? Have you figured out who he is?”  
  
“No!” I said. They were acting so strange like I had done something underhanded.  
  
“You’ll only know for sure tomorrow. Your inner wolf will tell you who your mate is,” said Calix.  
  
“I don’t want a mate,” I said honestly. I had never had a guy be nice to me and I could not picture it happening.  
  
“Why the hell not?” Alex asked like I was crazy for saying that. The Triplets were eager to find their real mate. They talked about it every birthday. They would visit other packs hoping to get a whiff of their mate. They thought maybe their mate was younger than them. That would explain why they could not pick up her scent. Only mates who had come of age could be discovered.  
  
“Because he’d just be mean to me and call me names and I get enough of that from you,” I snapped. I should not have snapped. I was a little frightened now. The triplets had not hit me since we were little. The last fight happened when I was eleven and they were fourteen. I had punched Calix, breaking his nose for calling me “fat and nasty” with “dead parents”. My parents whereabouts had never been confirmed and I always liked to think they were alive. After he had let out a blood-curdling scream and told his elder brothers about his nose, Alex slapped me and then Felix slapped me. Calix had been reluctant but they made him hit me. They dragged me out to the frozen river behind the pack house. There was a hole in it for fishing. I was small enough to dip in the hole. They had held me under the water until I blacked out. Their parents had been furious. I went to the hospital for hypothermia. I never knew what their punishments had been but after that we never got physical with each other, nothing more than a shove.  
  
“Are you stupid?” Asked Alex.  
  
I shrugged.  
  
“No werewolf would insult his own mate or be mean to her,” said Felix, rolling his eyes.  
  
“Don’t you know anything?” Added Calix.  
  
“Ok, thanks, I get it now,” I said simply.  
  
“You dressed up for us, didn’t you?” Said Felix smirking and rubbing his chin. The other two grinned. My heart leapt a little at the sight of their dimples. I shook my head. What was wrong with me? The triplets were monsters and good looks did not absolve them of that.  
  
“Don’t make her admit it,” said Calix. “She’s embarrassed, Felix.”  
  
“Admit it! You did this for us!” Felix exclaimed, grinning wickedly. He kept coming closer and my back was pressed against the kitchen island now.  
  
Alex was quiet, smiling faintly and watching me closely. I just wanted them to go away. I was so frustrated with my whole life. There would not be a single present for me tomorrow. No one had counselled me about my shift at midnight and I was scared. I knew it would be painful and I did not need this from these three privileged assholes who did not deserve the title of Alpha. They were physically Alphas but they had no integrity. They could not lead this pack. What a joke! I decided to play along.  
  
“Yeah, ok,” I said softly, looking down to feign embarrassment and hugging myself tightly. “I dressed up for you. I asked two girls at school to help me. I really did have a math thing but I went to get dolled up after so that made me late as well. I’m sorry.”  
  
I hid my face in my hands, stifling my laughter. They seemed to think I was crying.  
  
“Hey, you know, we aren’t the stupid little boys we used to be when we would fight with you,” said Alex gently. “We’re taking over this pack tomorrow and as you’re part of this pack we just wanna know what’s going on with you that’s all.”  
  
Huh?  
  
“Don’t cry, stupid,” said Felix exasperadteay.  
  
“Don’t insult her when you’re trying to cheer her up, stupid,” said Calix, turning on Felix. “Chasity,” said Calix, using my real name for the first time in nine years.  
  
I dropped my hands. I was shocked. I just stared at him.  
  
“You look pretty, ok” said Calix, winking.   
  
My heart skipped a beat. He was bending down. His face was really close to me.  
  
“Thanks for dressing up for us. I hope you wear an even shorter skirt tomorrow,” he said softly, smirking.  
  
I rolled my eyes. Alex and Felix burst into laughter. I tried to brush past them but Felix grabbed my arms and put my back against the island again. My breath hitched in my throat.  
  
“Did I say you could leave?” He asked, his nose brushing against my nose as he bent towards me. I squirmed in his arms.  
  
“You need to have respect for your Alphas, Charity,” Alex said, using my awful nickname. The spell that Calix had cast on me was broken.  
  
“Damn it!” I screamed. “Let me go! Three Alpha males against one omega female is insane. You have no honour,” I cried, struggling against Felix. He released me.  
  
“We were just playing with you Charity!” Said Felix “Good grief! Go! Run upstairs!”  
  
I ran upstairs and to my room. I locked the door. I sat on my cot, hugging my knees to my chest. The Alpha and Luna came knocking on my door when darkness fell. I went out to them.  
  
“We almost forgot, you have your first shift at midnight, same birthday as the triplets,” said Alpha Romeo rubbing the back of his neck.  
  
I smiled. Were they going to counsel me or give me a gift?  
  
“Yeah, so make sure and be out of the house at least by 11:45pm so you don’t break anything or make any mess when you shift,” said Luna Ronnie.  
  
I nodded. I supposed that was one piece of advice. I left the house at half past eleven wearing my old clothes. I crunched through the snow. It was pitch-black. I sighed. I was nervous. I was scared of the pain. I wished my parents could be here. For the first nine years old my life, they had been in and out of rehabs. They were inconsistent but they actually seemed to love me a lot. They would always make my birthdays and holidays special no matter how high they were. They were deeply in love with each other as mates and back then I almost looked forward to having a mate of my own. It was almost midnight. I did not want to rip my clothes so I removed them and stood in the snow naked and barefoot my curls covering me to my waist. If I had not been a werewolf I would have frozen to death.

I used to be very ambitious and someone who wants to achieve extraordinary things in life 6 years ago.

It makes me even more happy when I was able to physically exercise during the day, eat the right nutrition and sleep for atleast 7 hours.

I generally discount it below market rent by 100.00 to get the right person in and includes expenses (aka 350 instead of 450). Its worked out really well. Tho i have a question...

My current housemate and prev 2x have been really great, polite, friendly, clean etc, no complaints at all. They clean the kitchen after they use it (i don't use it as I don't cook dont hsve time tbh), they don't trash the place, we get along, all really great. 

So every weekend I do a general clean of common areas such as vacuum lounge, bleach shared bathroom, wipe down bathoom and kitchen counters, coffee table, remove leaves off balcony and general tidy up stuff lying around. It doesn't take long maybe 2 hrs or so all up. Id have to do this living on my own and just have continued with a flatmate. Apart from keeping their bedroom tidy and cleaning kitchen area when they use it, flatmate doesn't do anything which is ok to me.

I've been really busy eith work and study and current flatmate is short of money, they work maybe 15hrs a week max and just hang around a lot the rest of the time, which is fine as long as theh pay rent. So I said to my friends maybe I should offer them 50 bucks or so to help clean on weekends so I don't have to. My friends said they actually should help with this stuff anyways and that im piss weak not asking. I'm very non confrontational and figure id have 2 do this stuff on my own even if they weren't here so have never asked and just do it, I don't want some stupid cleaning roster bs tbh thats super ick to me, I just do it myself.

What's everyone think, should I even ask them to help - is this reasonable or gonna cause offence? Should i offer to pay or is that rude? Should they be helping out or should I just continue as it is? It doesn't bother me greatly but it would def help a little time wise if they helped out a little.",2,1746244685.0,AusPropertyChat,4,1.0,False

Here’s my thoughts.,"So I’m extremely financially irresponsible and fragrances are one of the few joys I have in my life. Every few months or so I roll on over to a decant site and blind buy a boatload of fragrances and replace ones I had really liked previously. So here’s what I got and my thoughts. 



Body Paint by Vilhelm  
Pear and Green pepper. That’s the main notes of this fragrance. I first got a sample of it 4 years ago and I loved it. It’s so strange and I love it. It’s long lasting, gives a green but not gross like plant sap green note and it’s cut with sweet pear. This is actually my 3rd time buying it because I keep coming back to it.

Indigo Flame The House of Potentia 
This is my second buy of this fragrance. It’s sweet and strong. I really enjoy the smell of it but the idea that this is a strong amber note like fragrantica said because to me, this smells really similar to Xerjoff Dolce Amalfi, which I lovingly call spicy juicy fruit. It’s got a bubble gum smell with more of the pepper and nutmeg coming out. 

Macaque Yuzu Edition Zoologist 
This is another one of my second buys because holy shit this is one of the best perfumes I’ve smelled in a long time. And I buy probably 100 or more a year so for it to stick with me like this it’s truly unique 
Yuzu is on full display here sure, but the resins olibanum and myrrh and the hinoki are stars that are backed up with the juniper and yuzu. 

I think the mark of a great perfume is one that is so expertly blended that you can’t truly distinguish where one note ends and another begins. They show such complexity that it evokes a whole feeling not just a single note and this is like that. 


Encelade Marc Antoine Barrois 
What even is perfume. What is Marc’s inspiration? This is a second buy again… every fragrance this guy makes I buy it and I buy it again. They smell weird. They smell unnatural. It has a mechanical and mineral smell to it. It’s odd. I love this and it’s one of my favorites. I wanna smell like weird stuff that isn’t like anything else. There’s just something about what he makes that has an amber/leather accord but it’s just not natural at all. Also for me big bonus points because you can’t get rid of this stuff. 
It is fragrance in the most oppressive way. You could shower and it’s still there. That is off putting for a lot of people. For me? Nah. I spend a lot on fragrances and I want to be noticed. I live in the south and I can’t tell you how many perfumes break down as soon as you get into a hot car LOL not this one. 


Forlorn Embers & Black Reigns Toskovat 
I got this bc it sounded moody and amusing. The notes honestly sound of putting. I do not like gourmands. Well well well this is a gourmand and it’s fascinating. It’s straight marshmallow and woods and bourbon. It’s like being out by a campfire while everyone makes s’mores. This stuff lasts too. I kept getting whiffs of it for hours and no matter if it was first spray or five hours later it was still good. Will buy again


Giardino Segreto Fornasetti 
I honestly don’t know why I got this. It’s probably because the name sounded cool and it was something that Scent Split recommended to me. It says that the ingredients are tomato leaves, geraniums, some berries and rhubarb, plus some other unimportant stuff. Besides the berries these are all notes I viscerally hate and this fragrance delivered. It smells straight up like being in the garden and breaking off some tomato stems, cutting rhubarb and trimming geraniums. It smells EXACTLY like this. If that is what you like then you’ll love it. I subjected my mom to this and she loved it, so it’s hers now lol.


Frutto Proibito Fornasetti
Huh. You’d think with the name it would be fruity. Nope. This punches above its weight class with strong tuberose jasmine and ylang ylang. I think the anise is playing around in the background and MAYBE one of the citruses walked by. Don’t get me wrong, it’s really nice I love white florals and this is classy. It’s got pretty good projection and it lasts for 5 ish hours. Not terrible not legendary. 




Arsenico V Canto
I can’t place this one into any unique category. It’s actually on a similar vein as spicy juicy fruit but an older more mature version of it that has cedar and the cypriol on the back end.  I got this because of the apple note and that’s one I don’t have too many representations of, but I can’t say it’s a showstopper of that note. If you were to tell me there’s no apple I’d believe you. As it calms down most of the sweet disappears and it leaves behind Aventus vibes which I am ok with because it still feels different enough. That being said I’d say pick one or the other between this and aventus bc this is really similar.


Don't Tell Jasmine Vilhelm
It’s strong jasmine. That’s pretty much it. 


Lake Bottom La Folie A Plusieurs 
This one is weird as hell and I thought the description was amusing enough that I just had to hit. It’s described as the smell of drying off on rocks from a summertime swim in a freshwater lake, the smell of sediments and nature and water. I fully expected this to smell not.. good. I was sooo wrong omg I love this. I’m not sure what it is I love specifically because this is a master craft of fragrance that smells like things that can’t be immediately identified. I’ve swam in freshwater lakes in summer and I can’t say that this is the smell of crawling back into the boat after getting high and trolling up towards the hot water ditch, but it does smell great. 

There’s like a swift note of green that’s not gross or algae like, then there’s a light fougere smell playing in the background with a note that I can only describe as slightly crayon like. As I said it’s weird as hell and I have no idea how to categorize this. 

Temple of Echoes Elysian
Picture yourself surrounded by incense definitely nag champa, potpourri, dust, and like soap or something. This smells like the hippy shop in my hometown Penny Lane. Imagine the place you went as a teen trying to get someone to sell you a bowl without carding you and then you also dreamt of buying your 10th black light poster to impress your friends in your basement. 
It’s not bad, it’s nostalgic even, but it’s not something I want to wear. 

Fleurs de Gardenia Creed
It’s straight gardenia, if you like that. 


Gyokuro Merchant of Venice 
This is… a shame.. I absolutely love some of this houses stuff and I saw the note profile which said fruity and that the first note listed was exotic fruits and peach I thought heck yeah! I like peach scents. This is not that. That’s a lie. This is neroli, lotus, and maybe the leaves of the tuberose but not the flowers. There are no fruits here, they didn’t even make an appearance. Maybe it smells like tea, it’s very green and that’s it. If that’s your thing cool. If you wanted fruits, don’t. 


Eau de Cyan Vertus 
This is soap, not the good kind but like soap from an industrial dispenser in a gas station or someplace similar. And then green something kicks in. It is longer lasting than you’d like for it to be but it’s also not good. Not a single note I wanted to smell made an appearance. 


Amazingreen Commes des Garçons  
The fragrance is described by this house as being jungle green mixed with gunpowder and flint. An homage to guerrila warfare? 
I suppose you’ve noticed a trend, I really dislike most green notes so this was a weird choice, which is what I wanted to do for myself. If I keep picking what I like then I don’t branch out. The description for this is so strange and I had to try it, also it had green pepper as a note profile and I love body paint so it was a gamble I wanted to take. 

I like this a lot. The green notes here are so much better and more complex. The orris comes out in the greens as does the coriander which gives it depth. The gunpowder and smoke is noticeable. This reminds me of something I can’t quite place but I’ve really enjoyed having time smelling it and trying to pinpoint what it is.


Florence Oscar London
I hate this. I hate it alot. You can’t pay me to put it back on to remember why I hate it, so figure that one out yourself. 

Sacred Scarab Zoologist
Boring and a bit drab. I really really want to like zoologist. Their ideas are so refreshing and interesting but this is not really interesting. Kind of reminds me of camel without the animal funk. It too smells like soap and shit incense. It’s a scrubber for sure. It’s up there with moth with how much I dislike this. Don’t buy it.

Francine Francesca Dell’Oro
This one’s disappointing a bit, but I need more time to figure out what I think. I am ambivalent on it. I was hoping to get more mastic and bergamot, though I got lemon and basil instead and I do like that. It’s green but not unpleasant entirely. I think I’m going to come back to it and see what I think after it’s had time to sit. 


Wet Stone Amouroud 
Wet stone is citrus scented megamere. It lasts a long time and has a nice aquatic mineral note to its. Pleasant and inoffensive. 


Hermit Coat Chapel Factory
This smells like pine tar. Smoke in a cabin from a kerosine lantern. A hermit would maybe smell like this, but this feels like something meant to echo a trapper or outdoorsman.  Meh. It’s ok


Oriental Mint Phaedon 
This smells like if you were to take a nightly bathroom routine of washing your face, brushing your teeth, and flossing, and turning it into a fragrance. I actually love this. This is a minty fresh, cooling, menthol like fragrance that gives summer vibes. 


Jetty Alfred Ritchy
Powdery fresh carrot seeds and orris roots and violet. This is lovely and what would be described as feminine. It’s a masterful blend and it’s light but it does project. It does not last as long as I would like though. 

Orris is such a weird fragrance note. I started seeking it out when I first tried eyes closed by Byredo which has this same powdery presence although to me is more Christmasy notes. this feels more like springtime and gardens without actually being green.

Carthusia Lady Carthusia 
This is a bouquet of fresh albeit more of the soapy flowers shine through, namely the lily of the valley, lilac, and iris. All of the flowers together would have been great but I feel like the lily and the lilac are lacking in realism. It’s not bad but not a standout either.

Mood Canvas Seven Gates
Green coffee, black and pink pepper, cardamom, pine, and the sweetness of caramel. It’s really nice actually. I know the scent profile is not the same but I feel like this is what IA cape heartache wanted to be. It’s got such a nice set of layers to it. It’s so complex with the sweetness, the spice, and the sap of trees. I absolutely will buy more of this.



Dacha Alfred Ritchy 
This is what Gyokuro wanted to be. It’s exotic fruits it’s peach and it’s actually those things. Not sickly sweet but imagine a sparkling peach drink with the pure peach and effervescence shining through. Dried woods and almost a medicinal vanilla are in the background but no one here is the single star. Everyone is playing nicely together and it’s a real winner. 


Nolo Alfred Ritchy 
This is a weird one. It’s got raspberry and incense. The coriander comes out but there’s the sweetness of the caramel coming out. I think the patchouli in this is a bit odd because it doesn’t quite play well. It stands out with the labdanum but I really wish that the raspberry had stayed longer or was more prominent. It’s not bad at all it’s just not really memorable. 
I don’t know anything about this fragrance house so I am interested in trying them out because these have been really interesting so far.

If not, where they see some major issue that would keep it from being successful.

His idea is to have a public facing coffee shop that hopes to create a community of local regular visiting makers, designer and other creators. Everyone that comes into the main part of the cafe could see (either in the next room or behind glass) a makerspace. The first room of the makerspace would have the no dust, relatively low noise machines like laser cutting/etching, 3D printers, etc. Beyond that but still visiable would be another wall of glass where the heavier/noiser/dustier equipment was located - ideally with a rollup door to the back alley. The front cafe would host a bi-monthly evening lectures and mixers and the back makerspaces would have hands on classes from time to time.

He also wants to host monthly import car meetups in the parking lot (perhaps early in the morning or in the evening around 6-9pm after most of the neighboring businesses have closed)

I was recommending that he change the cafe from public facing to more of a hangout/break area for members only and move the whole place to industrial park instead. Reasons I gave was lower rent, less neighbors to complain about the car meetups, his customers would strickly be those that are very interested in being there and no headaches for getting a license for food and coffee. However this would be at the tradeoff of finding members more easily due to all public walk-ins. 

Anyway which approach is more promising? 

Do you know of any public cafes that are also fairly well equipped makerspaces?",1,1746244523.0,makerspace,0,1.0,False
1kdjywg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kdjywg/aita_for_cutting_off_my_friend_for_flaking/,AITA for cutting off my friend for flaking?,"Hey reddit, i (22) female recently had a fight with a friend, lets call her Claire (22) over being unreliable, and constantly flaking on me. Me and claire have been very close, like attached to the hip close. And when i love someone i give them my all and i treat them like family. We go to the same school and share some classes so for two semesters i was constantly driving her around, picking her up from her house, adding 15-20 minutes to my commute just to drop her off. Mind you, she has never offered gas money or even offered a thank you coffee not even ONCE. Me and my cousin planned her birthday, took her out to a painting class and celebrated her birthday with gifts and a cake when no one else did. 

So to get to the actual story, our problems started with lab. We're both electrical engineers, our labs are long tedious and we've been lab partners for a while now and everything had been fine up until this semester. We usually dont finish lab on time so we would have to go to office hours to work on them there. She had been late for HOURS multiple times without saying anything leaving me to work on our labs by myself. The third or fourth time she did it i approached her saying ""hey i love you and i value our friendship so im gonna tell you this now so i dont build up resentment"" and i told her how i dont appreciate her being late, she apologized, said she wouldn't do it again and we immediately went back to being normal. However, it only went downhill from here. We were supposed to work on a particularly difficult lab in office hours, we agreed to show up around 10:30. I texted her at like 11 complaining about the TA, she responds saying that she was about to text me to let me know that she has period cramps so she would be a little late, I replied saying that its okay and take your time.  Mind you i said TAKE YOUR TIME and not feel free to not show up. I text again at like 1 complaining about the lab again and she says that would love to say she was gonna head over to help but she cant seem to shake off the cramps and that she's also nauseous. I send her a long ass message expressing my disappointment, i wasnt disrespectful at all and i said i wanted to talk things out. She replies with a long winded reply full of excuses masked as an apology. She says that ""i told you i was gonna be late, i said so"" and proceeds to claim that she has sleep issues and is dealing with mental health issues as well. Anyways we end up resolving it again and i did the majority of the heavy lifting by initiating the conversations, we make up. We had a project that we were supposed to work on together, i asked her when she wanted to meet up to work on it and she took forever to respond so i finished it by myself. I wrote the proposal, built the circuit and presented and she got to stand there and look pretty while i give her free points. I ask her if she could do the report on the project and she says yeah of course. It takes her a MONTH AND A HALF and i call her out on it on our second argument (sorry if the timeline makes no sense im exhausted and the story is so long) and she apologizes saying that she's working on it. 

Okay so now to the beginning of the end. We agree to meet up last Saturday to work on the project report together (which i suggested to do because she was never gonna work on it if i leave it up to her) and then study for our final. She said she was gonna meet a friend and that she could come to the cafe we usually go to around 12:30-1 and i told her i'll go a bit earlier to find a good spot. 12:50 rolls around i text her saying that i found a good spot, she responded with ""YAYY"" and then a few minutes later she texts ""im gonna be late because my friend cancelled and i lost motivation to get ready"" WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT EVEN MEAN??!!! Im like whatever and i just thumbs up her message. Its now 2:30 and she hasnt said anything so i text her ""dude its been three hours u cant be serious"" she replied with ""excuse me??"" And then says that she told me she was gonna be late and that she was gonna wait for her family to drop her off but they left without telling her, okaayyy????. And then she tries to make me feel bad by saying ""im currently getting soaked in the rain right now and i was just about to text you to tell you that im heading over"" OKAY BUT YOU DIDNT THO???? IT STILL DOESNT MAKE IT OKAY. When someone says they're gonna be late its 30 minutes at MOST and if its more than that they should provide updates, she never fucking updates me i have to practically beg her to communicate with me. Also she says ""im sorry but its very much NOT three hours"" okay bitch it was two hours its still excessive. Then she tells me she's heading to work to study there instead. I lose it at that point and i send her this text. ""No thanks, im good. I am seriously so upset with you. I've never had ANY of my friends disrespect my time as much as u. Even if you told me that ur gonna be late (which is honestly shitty by itsself bc the excuse was dumb) normally when ppl say they're gonna be late they usually mean by half an hour at MOST and if they're gonna come any later they would send updates like is this ur first day on earth? And u thinking that u have the right to be mad is beyond me. Im so fucking done"" and i understand that i might've been harsh but i had been coddling her up to that point and i was done with her bs. She replies THE NEXT DAY with a long ass message where she gives me the shittiest apology ever. She says that she would have never flaked if she wasnt dealing with sleep issues and that its out of her control. She says that she had a few upsetting things happen to her that day so me saying that her excuse is dumb was hurtful (all i got is ""i lost motivation to get ready"" and it is pretty fucking dumb) she says that she doesn't appreciate me asking her if its her first day on earth and that she doesn't think that her flaking on a study session warrants that reaction. She keeps apologizing while giving me a sob story. I have depression, anxiety and adhd and i've dealt with insomnia before, yet i've never weaponized my mental illness to excuse my shitty behavior, we're both on the exact same medication too. I also am an international student and im in constant fear of not being able to pay rent or pay for my next meal and now i also have to worry about my visa with everything going on, i was initially planning to stay here in the states and find a job but i recently realized that its not possible and that i would have to move to a new country and start over again. She lives with her parents, doesnt pay rent, is only taking the circuit analysis class with me and comm 101. I reply to her saying that if she thinks this is just about flaking on a study session then her apology doesnt mean anything and apologizing without taking action is also useless. I said a lot of things but this post is already long enough. She replies saying how she didnt realize that ditching me in the cafe would hurt me and apologizes yet again and asks if i wanna meet up after our class the next day to talk. I agree.

The next day comes around and my grade for the midterm comes out and im displeased with it to say the least, i was crying my eyes out so i didnt want to go to class so i went to that cafe close to campus again. I text her saying that i wont be going to class and that if she still wants to talk i'll be at the cafe. She texts back an hour later saying she cant make it which is fine but she didnt ask to reschedule she decided to send me another long sob story, saying things like ""she hit a wall"" and ""she hasnt been taking time for herself"" and that she needs space to work on herself to be a better friend. She acknowledges that she's been a shitty friend and that i've been nothing but an amazing friend and that my expectations for her were completely reasonable. I dont reply to the text cuz its same recycled sob story and i told her im done talking about it over text. We have a lab final the next day, she doesnt try to approach me. She texts me the same night clarifying that she worded her text badly and her saying that she needs space to do self care doesnt mean that she doesnt wanna talk to me or hang out with me. Then what the fuck does it mean? I tell her that if she needs space she can take as much time as she wants to figure things out and that im here when she needs to talk. She does this respond. I text her the next day saying that this has been draining me and that this whole thing is so silly it could be resolved if we just have the conversation. She texts back saying that she doesnt wanna drag this out either which is why she texted me earlier this week. Okqy CUNT but you didnt show up which is fine but then u didnt fucking reschedule or try to approach me???? Like god why does she expect me to initiate HER apology to me??? Anyways we agree on friday after my therapy session, i told her im done with therapy at 1 so do u wanna meet at 1:15 and she tells that yeah it works for her and that she can meet me on campus. I say that works and then she doesn't say anything. Next comes around, its 1:15..1:30 and she still doesnt say anything. Am i in the wrong to think that the normal human way to go about this is that when she gets on campus she shoots me a ""hey im here lmk when ur done"" or literally anything. She's here to apologize about her chronic lateness and lack of communication and YET SHES STILL EXPECTING ME TO TEXT FIRST. I leave and im crying in my car atp and she shoots me a ""hey im at the library lmk when u wanna talk"" at like 1:45. I text her that i left bc i thought she wasnt gonna show up. She goes ""..."" ""okay then"" and then gets very passive aggressive and goes ""i've been waiting for nearly 40 minutes and i was waiting for you yo text me when ur done with therapy"" and i tell her that she didnt confirm our meeting so i assumed she just bailed on me again. But then i immediately text saying okay im heading back to campus rn and as im about to pull out she texts saying ""i literally did"", ""scroll up"". And i text ""you know what no im done"" she goes ""that's fine but don't say it's because i didn't confirm, because i did"" im a crying mess atp bc i just cant believe how many chances i gave her and how she still kept fucking up. I say u cant believe how inconsiderate you are this is the the fourth time you've made me cry this week. She texts back saying ""ok fine but dont say that im inconsiderate because i didnt confirm, bc i did"" i reply ""we're meeting to talk about you being late and not communicating enough you cant always expect to text first"" she goes "" i was NOT LATE"" ""?????????"" And then here's her last reply before i block her ""me waiting here for you is not selfish though, nor is me thinking you'd text when you got out of therapy. you've been very aggressive with me this week while i've just been trying to meet up with you to talk. i'm heading home"" idk how she managed to flip this on me and make herself the victim yet again. Her saying that i've been very aggressive to her is WILD cuz i very much haven't been. And to say that SHE'S the one who's been trying to talk???? Oh my fucking god. I have been grieving this entire day, i cant believe how easily someone can go from being close, knowing all of my secrets, trauma, worst fears and dreams to a stranger. I have so many memories with her that will now forever be tainted, all the places we used to go together and sit and yap or study in for hours just bring me pain now. I know i sound dramatic but i feel like I'm experiencing immense loss and i don't know how i will cope. It feels like someone ripped my heart out. Am i in the wrong here??? Everyone is telling me that im not but i feel like im losing my mind. This is long and probably filled with grammar mistakes and typos but im sorry i dont have it in me to go back fix them. I have all the screenshots of the messages if anyone's interested but i doubt anyone will go through this whole thing in the first place lol. ",3,1746244396.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Belladonna  
  
Bella stood in the shower in the Luna’s suite, allowing the warm water to wash over her. She was pleasantly exhausted, Parker had left her suite; he was off to a mating ball in another state. She had four days now, where he wasn’t going to be there inside the pack.  
  
She was his Luna; had been for eight years now, but she was bound to him not by her choice, had been chosen for him by her own Alpha and Luna; just to get rid of her, and she knew it.  
  
She was the youngest child of her father, and unwanted and shunned; a bastard child not born of his Mate bond, and that was why she was hated by the Luna in her home pack.   
  
This allianced mating, that she’d been bound to at just 19 years of age. It was, she believed, her father’s Luna’s way of getting rid of her from their pack, once and for all. The only solace she had was that there was a detailed mating alliance. That did not allow for Parker to bring harm to her.  
  
Parker came to her room, the Luna’s suite every other night to bed her, and though the s\*x was good, more than good, damned near on amazing at times, she had to admit, because he wasn’t just a man that came and took what he wanted.  
  
No, he was a man that enjoyed s\*x, enjoyed knowing he pleased the woman in his bed, even if she had been sold to him. Parker could spend hours in her bed, touching and tasting her, sometimes all night long. He was not a terrible Mate to her, but he was indifferent most of the time.  
  
She had been given to him to stop a war between their two packs, had been Marked and Mated by him, taken as his Chosen Luna, with full view of rejecting her one-day down the line. She didn’t actually mean anything to him.  
  
He didn’t love her, and she didn’t love him. She could enjoy him being in her bed because of the Mate Bond, enjoyed it a lot, and had been known to scream with pleasure at him having his way with her. He could be utterly insatiable at times, and a part of Bella craved him; as his Mate she loved his every touch. She actually enjoyed her heat when it came, just once a year, spent seven glorious days being mated by him, and the s\*x; all rough I’ve just got to have alpha-blooded needs on the surface.   
  
Screamed in utter bliss that week multiple times a day and half all night, but it was the only time he never got out of her bed and slept in his suite.  
  
Every time always ended the same way. The moment he couldn’t scent her heat anymore, he was up and gone from her suite. Eight years of it; nothing had changed for him. Just three days ago, her heat had ended, and he’d left in the middle of the night. She’d not even known, she had been exhausted by them mating furiously that last time, and she had slept like the dead. Then she'd woken up on her own because her heat was over.  
  
This morning, him in her bed for a few hours before the sun rose. It was because he was going away for a mating ball and would be gone for four days. The pack he was visiting was in another state, 12 hours away, unaffiliated to him but a good opportunity for his wolves to pair up.  
  
There was nothing unusual about him being gone for four days, seeing as how far away that pack was, sometimes it was five full days. That was nice for her, he wasn’t one to tax his wolves, and so they stopped overnight on the way there or back if necessary. Not that he informed her of his doings, she just learned it over the years.   
  
Parker didn’t think that he was required to tell her his movements, she was only his Mate and Luna, due to the mating alliance that they had. It didn’t bother her at all, it just meant she had four days to herself this week. He always liked to have s\*x before he left and when he got back as well, something about he had an alpha-blooded s\*x drive that he needed to sate on a regular basis.  
  
She didn’t argue about it, she had it too, there was no need to either, they both got all the tingly mate bond goodness in that bed of hers. And it was always in her bed. She’d never even seen inside the Alpha Suite; that was not a place for her to be.  
  
Bella dressed for the day and headed downstairs, to get herself some breakfast, where she saw him and his unit all heading across the foyer and out the front door of the packhouse to leave. He nodded to her, but never said goodbye to her. No one here thought anything about it, they all knew she had been given to him. Was not his Goddess-Gifted Mate.  
  
Though the pack here was nice to her, they didn’t treat her badly at all, that had been a surprise to her, and she herself was nice to all of them. She actually liked the pack, and it seemed the pack actually liked her. Looked to her for advice even. She did her Luna duties as was required of her.  
  
She had been sent here against her will, but actually found that she fitted in better inside this pack than her own home pack. She had respect here from this pack, from Parker to a certain degree, she thought.   
  
She’d learned how to be a Luna to this pack, and attended to all of those duties that Parker had tasked her with, when she’d first been brought here. She had even been allowed to study with his pack’s doctor in the hospital, and now, eight years later she herself was a good doctor.  
  
Bella specialized in the delivery of pups, and looking after the she-wolves in labour, using her Luna Calm to help them settle when fully distressed, and things got a bit on the hairy side. She’d not lost a single pup or she-wolf in the past eight years of assisting and then delivering on her own.  
  
She was a fully registered doctor with this pack, and one day when she left, she would be a doctor for another pack somewhere else. That was the goal. Though what the really crazy thing was, was that six months after she went into heat herself, there was always an explosion of pups within the pack.  
  
It hadn’t gone unnoticed by the pack's doctor, her mentor Annette, she shook her head and had stated “It’s you, you know.” They often laughed and joked about it. Annette had already chuckled just yesterday about getting supplies ready for pups to be born in a few months’ time.  
  
Bella had just snorted and shaken her own head, they were currently going through that now, that heat she’d had last week was completely unexpected and out of the blue, her second one for this year. Had not been expected at all.   
  
Annette’s theory only made Bella shake her head, she thought it was just a coincidence was all. She’d not gotten pregnant once in the past eight years of having a heat once a year.  
  
A part of her was glad of it as well, knowing that there was a clause in her mating alliance that stated all pups she had while still bonded to Parker, were to be given to him. When he found his Goddess-Gifted Mate and rejected her, she had to leave them behind for him to raise. They were his heirs. It was not something she wanted to happen.  
  
She knew that Parker would make her give them up as well. He followed all his alliance dealings to the letter. She also knew it was a clause he’d written into their mating alliance himself. He wasn’t willing to relinquish any child to her, he would be claiming all of them as his heirs. She might be their mother if she ever birthed any pups, but she had no rights to them; that was how she looked at that clause.  
  
She saw him sometimes looking at her, in the weeks after her heat, assessing her, she knew, listening for a heartbeat of a pup. He wanted an heir and she, being Alpha-blooded like he was, their pup would be a pure-blooded heir for this pack. There were no pups, even though she wasn’t on birth control of any kind, he wouldn’t allow it. He was hoping for a pup between them and she knew it.  
  


# 2

Belladonna  
  
Bella thought there was no pup simply because she didn’t want one and her wolf certainly didn’t want one to a Mate that was not her Fated or that was how it felt to Bella. Neither of them were at all interested in having a pup with a Mate that was going to, at some point in time, whether it be in the near or far future, reject them for his Goddess-Gifted when she came along.   
  
Why would anyone want to do that when they knew that their Alpha Mate would be sending them away, pretty much just tossing them out of his pack and without their pups, making them sever their kind bond to however many pups they had and loved. No she-wolf she knew would agree with that, it was insane; and neither she nor Freya, her wolf, were interested in that happening to them.  
  
Parker had made a few comments over the years about it, and she’d stared at him, stated simply, “Maybe, Selena doesn’t want us to have a pup, Parker.”  
  
To which he’d retort, “And maybe you’re infertile.” Sounding a bit on the angry side about it.  
  
“Could well be,” she’d nodded at him simply. She’d not taken offense to his words.   
  
Though she wasn’t infertile. She’d been tested a few years back along with himself after that very comment. She’d thought he’d gone away and thought about his own words, and maybe come to the conclusion that one of them was infertile.  
  
So they’d both been tested at his request, and they were both fine and capable of conceiving a pup, apparently. It just wasn’t meant to be as far as she was concerned, and she was honestly glad of it.  
  
Though during her heats, Parker knotted her every time he came, and she him back, liked the bloody feeling of it as much as he did, and she knew it. She understood that being knotted to one's Mate kind of made you feel whole, that it was part of the mate bond as well.  
  
He had in fact knotted her this morning, had looked right down at her while still knotted to her and sighed softly, contentedly. She knew he liked the feeling of being knotted to her. All wolves did unless they weren’t their Mate.  
  
His blue eyes had looked into her blue ones, and he’d murmured softly as he’d looked down at her, a gentle smile on his face, “An heir would be nice, don’t you think Belladonna.” He hadn’t said it in months, and she’d been a little surprised to hear him bring it once more, she had thought he’d give up on that thought, though the way he said her name softly, almost sounded like he cared at that moment. She knew better though, he never shortened her name like everyone else inside the pack did. He was the only one to call her Belladonna, and she was certain that he did it, to remind himself she was his Chosen Mate.   
  
“I guess it would.” She’d answered him. It was all she ever said on the subject of a pup between them.   
  
She’d only ever actually said ‘no’ once, and it had set him and his beast off into a fit of rage. She’d not really understood that. He didn’t love her, she knew that. But she’d never dared to say it again. Because his anger over her declining to even think it was a good idea, had filtered into the pack.  
  
The pack had been on edge over his foul mood, and she’d seen him stomping around and grating out orders at everyone. He’d been cranky about it for over a week. So now she stated she guessed it would be, instead of telling him no she didn’t want one with him. To save the pack from his temper was all, something he had, but she rarely saw, the pack rarely saw, and she had a feeling he tried not to lose it for no reason at all. The pack did like him, respect him and were happy with him as their Alpha.  
  
Sometimes she wondered what that war with her home pack had been all about. She didn’t recall there being a war, perse, there had been a full threat of one, that much she did know. Though her father and Parker had probably not wanted that war and tried everything to stop it before it got started. She’d not been privy to that and during those two days everyone had been sequestered to their homes. Though she did know there had been a wolfen force at the border of the pack.   
  
She shook off her thoughts, she didn’t need a trip down memory lane, that was a long time ago. She ate her breakfast in the dining room as she always did, smiled at the wolves in here eating as well. Chuckled as a boy of six climbed up onto the seat next to her and tugged on her arm “Luna, mummy’s going to have her baby today.”  
  
“Is she now?” she’d smiled down at him.  
  
“Yes, daddy took her to the hospital just a minute ago.”  
  
Bella smiled at him “Are you excited to meet your little sister Franky?” she asked him.  
  
“Yes.” He smiled big up at her “Aunty Becky is watching me.”  
  
Bella looked up to find Rebekah his aunt walking this way. She was heavily pregnant herself. “Daisy just went into labour, Luna.” Rebekah told her as she walked over to her.  
  
“I just heard; Franky’s excited.” She ruffled his blond hair. “How are you doing today, Becky?”  
  
“Alright, will you be going to the hospital soon?” Becky asked.  
  
“Yes, right after breakfast. Everything will be fine with your sister; I’ve not lost a pup yet and am not about to start today.” She reassured Becky.  
  
Bella had gone into heat six months ago. This was going to be a busy week here inside the pack. Her last heat had been very unexpected. Had come in the middle of the night, out of nowhere and Parker had not been in the pack for it either. That first night had been agony locked in her suite, unable to sate the needs from her heat.  
  
But he’d come back in short order, when he’d been informed she was in heat, and she’d been on him the moment he’d walked into her suite, practically ripped his pants off him and shoved him down all alpha aggression, and she ridden the hell out of him with all she’d had right by the suites' entry door.  
  
He hadn’t cared, had enjoyed it himself, enjoyed all her heats while they lasted. He got to have s\*x for hours every day and half the nights as well, it was all rough and raw, both their alpha-blooded needs in full swing. They were both very aggressive about getting what they wanted during her heats. It was kind of unavoidable, she thought. Just their bloodlines.  
  
She pulled herself from her thoughts and made her way to the pack’s hospital, pulled on her scrubs. Today she was wearing soft blue scrubs with sloths all over them; she thought they were cute.  
  
The pack hospital had, had a uniform when she’d arrived in this pack, black scrubs, she’d gotten rid of them, thought they were very unfriendly, and some of the pack’s children who’d never been in the hospital before had shied away from the nurses and doctors on their first visit.  
  
Now all the nurses and doctors wore fun scrubs with patterns all over them, some even tailored them to the seasons. It had helped the children relax and be comfortable. They did have a standard uniform for after war or pack attacks, when their wolves were grieving the loss of loved ones. Simple respectful scrubs that were mint green and white.  
  
Despite being brought here as a Chosen Mate and Luna, Parker did expect her to attend all Luna duties, and she did them well. He couldn’t fault her on that. He didn’t have any complaints, and had actually told her she made a good Luna to his pack.   
  
That had been just a few years back. She’d just smiled and nodded, accepted the compliment from him, they were few and far between, had told him in return, “I like the pack members, they’re nice to me.” and they were. ""I'll always do my best for them, Parker.""  
  
The Lustrous Moon was a much nicer pack to her than her home pack had been.

Belladonna  
  
It was a long four days inside the pack. Bella had delivered 17 pups over those days, she had lived inside the pack hospital itself, slept in her office, on the couch in there so she didn’t have to make the trip from the Luna suite to the hospital, which took 20 minutes at a casual stroll, it was closer to the pack's town than the packhouse, and she understood that was because it had been built to cater to the majority of the pack who lived in the town not the packhouse.  
  
Parker was due home today around lunchtime, and she knew that the moment he was finished initiating his new pack members into his pack, and allocating them homes if they needed it, he was going to want to go right to her room and have s\*x.   
  
He couldn’t go more than two days without s\*x on any normal given week here inside the pack. With the exception of that one week, he'd been angry. He'd stayed away from her that week; not brought his anger into her bed. But when he had crawled into bed, Goddess she'd never thought he was going to stop eating her out. Gotten multiples from him, several in fact, before she fallen asleep and woke up alone.  
  
This was how it had been for the past eight years. She, however, was actually very tired today, exhausted, she would say, had pulled an all-nighter last night and had yet to get any sleep. Bella had delivered three pups in the past 7 hours, and Annette had delivered two herself.  
  
Bella had received a text from him just as she was sitting down at her desk in her Luna's office, “I’ll be home in a few hours.” It had read. Bella had frowned down at it, a little confused as to why he’d sent it. He’d never done that before.  
  
She shook it off, likely he was just letting her know that he expected them to get naked in her bed when he got home, because he wanted to have s\*x. It had been four days. Well, it wasn’t going to be like that today. She had many things to do this morning herself and was too tired for s\*x; he’d have to understand.  
  
She was in all likelihood going to be in the Luna’s office when he crossed the pack border as well, because she had to now sit down and register all of those pups with the pack. Get their parents' files all up to date as well; having to register all 17 pups took time, and she didn’t make mistakes.  
  
It was going to be a long day, and she’d probably sleep like the dead after Parker had his way with her at some point later in the afternoon. She sighed as she sat in her chair, staring at the computer screen in front of her, her eyes kept drooping and she micro napped a few times, was fighting off sleep that she desperately needed and she knew it.  
  
She got up and looked at the time. It was just on 8am. She could sleep for two hours and then pull on her alpha-bloodline after that, to get her through the rest of the day, until she turned in for the night, she would go to bed early and she knew it. She set herself an alarm on her phone and crashed out on the couch in the Luna's office.  
  
Woke up and stretched and got coffee, when her alarm went off, she was still tired but could function at least. Returned to her job of documenting the births of those pups, and the condition of the mothers. She hissed as pain shot through her left arm, almost felt like someone had stabbed her and dragged a knife up her arm. It only lasted a few seconds, and she rubbed her arm and shook it off. It was odd, to say the least. Never felt that happen before.  
  
She finished documenting those pups, attached their baby pictures to the files and smiled at each one of them, she did love babies, they were so cute. All her life she’d been in a pack hospital. Her mother had died in childbirth, and she’d been raised by her grandmother, a nurse in her home pack, she’d never really had any friends, not being that she was her father’s bastard daughter, not even her half siblings liked her.  
  
Bella had learned to stick close to her grandmother, and she herself had worked in the pack hospital from a young age, become a runner for those that worked there, dashing off to get things they needed.   
  
Then she had started working in the hospital at 16, had dropped out of school altogether. It was not fun for her in that school, she got bullied by her half siblings all day long. She’d had one a few months older than she was, and she was in all her classes.  
  
Her father had not cared that she’d dropped out of school at all, he’d also never sent her off to Alpha College, she wasn’t a legitimate heir so didn’t need to go. She’d never asked to go either. She never went into the packhouse for anything, just tried to be invisible to that pack.  
  
Her father may have claimed her as his kin, but she was not part of the Alpha’s family, though she didn’t think Parker knew that. She was in fact hated by all of her siblings; the Luna especially hated her existence. Bella kind of understood that. She’d learned at a young age her conception had seen the packs Luna be in agony with the pains of betrayal.  
  
Though her grandmother had told her once, it wasn’t as it seemed, and not to believe that her mother was a mistress, she’d not been, hadn’t wanted to be bedded by her father, the alpha of that pack. She’d hadn’t had a choice about it, but then in the next breath she’d stated don’t blame your father either, he didn’t really want to bed your mother. It had confused her a lot. If neither had wanted it, how had it happened?   
  
Bella pulled herself from her thoughts as her tummy rumbled, and she got up to go and have lunch. It was midday and Parker wasn’t back yet, though she didn’t think it would be far off at all. He’d text her at 7am, a few hours. She shrugged, likely they’d all stopped for food somewhere.  
  
She was just returning to her office when she felt him come back into the pack, and he mind-linked to her near instantly, “Belladonna, meet me in the foyer.” He stated and cut the link before she could even reply to him.  
  
She was actually in the foyer now, so took up a seat with some of the pack’s kids and watched them play a board game. They all smiled up at her, and she smiled back at them, helped that youngest one out a bit.  
  
She looked up as Parker walked into the packhouse, and there was a woman walking next to him, quite tall, almost as tall as he was, though Bella noted she was wearing stilettos, they clicked loudly on the tiled floor as she strode along next to Parker. She looked more than annoyed to Bella.  
  
Bella stood as was expected of her to greet him when he came home, and watched as the woman looked right at her now as well, then there was just anger in those eyes of hers. Bella saw her take a full step closer to Parker and try to reach out and curl her hand around his forearm. Parker frowned down at her and brushed it away. “I’ve explained this to you Carina,” he stated flatly “No touching at this time.”  
  
There was more anger welling off the she-wolf now, and Bella understood right away, Parker had found his Goddess-Gifted Mate at that mating ball and though he would want to claim her for himself. He couldn’t, not until he’d rejected Bella. It was part of their mating alliance.  
  
“Axel, please take Carina to get some lunch.” Parker addressed his Delta, and motioned for them to move on passed him. His eyes moved back to her after Axel walked Carina off, “Belladonna, my office please.” He stated casually, and turned and walked that way himself.  
  
“Yes, Parker.” She answered him simply, she knew what this was all about, it was time for him to reject her, so he could go and claim his actual mate. Part 1: Null & Voided",1,1746244377.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

'There was a time when I thought that you did everything right, no lies, no wrong, boy, I must've been out of my mind'  
  
\~ Beyoncé  
  
Elena's P.O.V.  
  
Jesus please forgive me for I have not yet sinned but I plan to and worst of all, I fear that I'll enjoy sinning more than I should and I'll take great pleasure in it so that I can get revenge on those who have dared to betray me.  
  
You see lord, I made a really stupid decision when I was just a dumbass eighteen-year-old kid and I did so because I thought that I had found the love of my life, my other half, my soul mate but I was wrong and now I plan to rectify the mistake that I made seven years ago.  
  
I just hope that you can forgive me my dear lord and you don't hold what I have to do against me because even you know that I've been through enough with this jackass.  
  
I've always known my husband Tristan was a first-class jerk with a bad temper from the moment I first met him, in fact, I was warned by my father and older brother Brandon to stay away from him because they knew he was bad news from the very start but my stubborn, hot-headed ass wouldn't listen to them.  
  
Now look at me.  
  
Looking back now, I really wish that I had listened to them, maybe if I had then I wouldn't have been forced to live through seven years of pure torture at the hands of the very man I loved and who I thought loved me.  
  
Lately, I've been looking for a way to escape my abusive marriage but I didn't know how and this thought pissed me off more than anything because I'm a very strong woman physically and I used to be strong mentally as well but years of being abused in every possible way by Tristan has f\*\*\*\*d me up and left me the one thing I had never been which is vulnerable.  
  
I had tried many ways to escape this torturous life including just simply filing for divorce but this plan backfired and resulted in me receiving a broken nose and wrist as well as several broken ribs amongst other injuries after Tristan found out and attacked me.  
  
I was starting to think that maybe there wasn't a way out for me except for death but then seven months ago, I was finally given an out thanks to the wife of one of Tristan's business associates who had sent me a text message with a picture of my cheating, scumbag husband making out with my older sister Brandy on a beach while he was supposedly away on a business trip in the Bahamas.  
  
I already knew Tristan was cheating on me because all of the classic signs were there like a huge blinking red light which I stupidly chose to ignore.  
  
For example, the cheap perfume on him and his clothes when he would come home from work, the lipstick on his collar, the hickeys on his body and the secretive way he was with his phone but I didn't know who his w\*\*\*e was until I had received this text.  
  
That was the day I put my plan into action to not only get revenge on the two people who have caused me so much pain but also to divorce my husband and finally free myself of him.  
  
The first thing that I did was I sent the intimate photo of Brandy and Tristan to every major news outlet in America but that didn't do much to hurt them because Tristan's team immediately put out a statement saying it was A.I. created by trolls who were jealous of me and were trying to ruin my marriage.  
  
The next thing I did was I 'accidentally' shredded an important file of Tristan's which he needed for an important business meeting that he had been working so hard on and it would've landed him a major million-dollar deal if he had managed to secure it but because of me, he didn't.  
  
I also may or may not have let slip to the sister of a billionaire businessman from India who he was hoping to create a partnership with that Tristan was dating a girl who did OnlyFans for a living which automatically ended their partnership.  
  
As for Brandy, the only thing I could do to her was hit her where it truly hurts and that's her job, so I called in a favour with an old friend of mine who is the owner of a top modelling agency in L.A. who my sister was signed to and he immediately cancelled her contract upon hearing about her extra-curricular activities.  
  
To be fair, he was already planning on cancelling her contract anyway because he was getting fed up with her and her attitude, as well as her poor work ethic.  
  
There's also the fact that he had received numerous complaints from other models who had issued an ultimatum to him that either she goes or they do because they can't stand her.  
  
It's nice to know that I'm not the only one.  
  
I know you may be thinking that I'm being petty and that I should just end it with him and leave with some pride and dignity still intact but I can't because they've put me through so much hell, more so my husband than my sister and these little losses feel like huge victories for me.  
  
I've also been working on myself and my mental, physical and emotional strength these past seven months so that I can become the old Elena again.  
  
The Elena who was feisty and strong and who would never in a million years take s\*\*t from anyone, especially not someone like her husband or sister.  
  
I've been going to the gym every day and I've even attended some self-defence classes to brush up on my skills which seem to have been dormant lately.  
  
I've also been reading some self-help books which have helped me to realise my worth and that I deserve better than the life I'm living right now.  
  
The last thing I wanted was to become one of those women who say they're going to leave and then don't, I also wanted to make sure that I was strong enough to follow through with my plans because I don't want this life anymore.  
  
I'm done.  
  
Anyway, I've just arrived home after meeting with my dad and my lawyer to arrange a divorce which I'm going to get this time even if it kills me.  
  
I was heading upstairs to my bedroom so that I could pack my things when I was greeted by the sounds of loud moans coming from it which left me feeling disturbed and disgusted but also very intrigued as well because I didn't know if there were animals or two human beings having s\*x in there.  
  
Between Tristan's grunting like a constipated pig in distress and Brandy's high-pitched oh yeah every five seconds like an effeminate hyena, I couldn't differentiate if the noises came from them or animals.  
  
Not to mention, the dirty talk between these two is...well, it's questionable and it made me think of the quote by Tatianna on RuPaul's Drag Race when she said we all make choices but that was a choice.  
  
I walked over to the door and made sure I was quiet when I opened it so that I wouldn't startle or alert old McDonald's s\*x-craved farm animals.  
  
I then leaned against the doorframe with my arms crossed over my chest as I watched in disgust at the sight in front of me which made me want to vomit.  
  
Not because of who was having s\*x and where they were having it but because of the position they were currently in which looked both painful and uncomfortable.  
  
There's also the fact that it's my sister who is naked on that bed and who the hell wants to see their sibling in their birthday suit? certainly not me, I can assure you.  
  
""You know...I never understood what Beyonce meant when she said you showed your ass and I saw the real you but now I do because you Tristan Scott Lockwood have quite literally shown your ass and I'm finally starting to see the real you, it's just a shame that I'm seven years too late to dodge the bullet but hopefully, I can one day say you were the best thing I never had""  
  
I said with a smile instantly startling the pair who quickly scrambled off the bed to hide their nudity.  
  
Well, Tristan did, his stupid self actually fell off the bed and landed on his bare ass while Brandy on the other hand made a very lazy attempt to hide her nudity and I could tell that the b\*\*\*h was revelling in what was going on and she didn't care if she was nude or not as it happened.  
  
She's a model and an OnlyFans 'star', not to mention, she's f\*\*\*\*d more men than a pornstar during their entire career, so go figure being naked doesn't faze her.  
  
""Elena baby, wh..what...what are you doing here?""  
  
""I was in the neighbourhood, I thought I'd stop by for a chat""  
  
I say sarcastically.  
  
""Ellie baby, this...""  
  
Tristan said as he pointed his finger between himself and Brandy.  
  
""This isn't what it looks like""  
  
Tristan says and I roll my eyes.  
  
""Why do cheating bastards like you always say it's not what it looks like when they've been caught in the act?""  
  
I ask with irritation in my voice.  
  
""You're naked and she's naked, you're a dirty, disgusting, sweaty mess and Brandy...well, she's always been a dirty, disgusting, sweaty mess from the moment puberty smacked her in the t\*\*s like a freight train""  
  
I say and Brandy gasps while Tristan looks at me with a horrified and angry expression on his face.  
  
""Not to mention, her hair looks like a rats nest, you've got scratch marks on your chest, back and ass, oh and the most obvious one is that your d\*\*k is currently wet and saluting the troops after braving the deep, dark trenches between my sister's legs...what the f\*\*k else could it look like, Tristan? were you both playing a game of Twister?""  
  
I ask with irritation and frustration in my voice.  
  
""Baby, I swear, it's not...""  
  
Tristan once again tried to plead his case but was cut off by a very frustrated and angry Brandy.  
  
""Ignore him, Elena, it's exactly what it looks like, we were having s\*x right here in your marital bed""  
  
Jesus Christ.  
  
Someone should call the media and let them know that we've got a modern-day Albert Einstein on our hands.  
  
I thought to myself whilst rubbing my forehead in frustration.  
  
""Thanks for that, Brandy, I'm not sure I would've ever gotten the truth out of him without you here pointing out the obvious to me""  
  
""You're welcome""  
  
Brandy says with a smile as she pulls a face at Tristan who looks at her like what the f\*\*k? and I don't blame him for feeling this way, to be honest with you.  
  
This b\*\*\*h wouldn't know what sarcasm is unless it came shaped like a d\*\*k and smacked her in the face.  
  
""Ellie love, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for this to happen, it was a mistake""  
  
""A mistake?""  
  
I ask incredulously.  
  
""A mistake is when you put salt on your cornflakes or in your morning coffee instead of sugar, Tristan, not when you repeatedly stick your c\*\*k inside of your sister in laws p\*\*\*y""  
  
""But this was a mistake, babe, I promise you...why don't I go and get dressed, so that we can go downstairs and talk, hmm?""  
  
Translation, let's go downstairs so that I can manipulate you and make you believe my lies so that you won't try to leave me again.  
  
""I'm just gonna go and...""  
  
""How long?""  
  
I cut Tristan off and he looks at me confused.  
  
""What?""  
  
""You heard me, Tristan""  
  
I say while glaring at him.  
  
""How long have you two been screwing each other behind my back?""  
  
""N..not that long, Ellie""  
  
Brandy says nervously as she shares a nervous look with Tristan.  
  
""Well, how long is that then, Brandy? do you mean long as in you guys just had one long passionate night together? or is it long as in the length of your hit list of men who you've spread your legs to over the years? which one is it?""  
  
I asked Brandy who looked at me wide-eyed like she couldn't believe I'd say something so vile and vulgar towards her.  
  
""It's only been a few months, Elena, that's all""  
  
Tristan said and I scoffed while rolling my eyes as Brandy's shocked expression quickly changed to a nasty glare as she sneered at my husband before looking back at me with an innocent butter wouldn't melt look on her face but her eyes gave away her true feelings and she was feeling very happy, proud and smug right now.  
  
""He's lying to you, Elena, we've been having an affair for over two years now, in fact, we just celebrated our anniversary last month""  
  
Wow.  
  
""Brandy...""  
  
Tristan said through gritted teeth but was cut off by my sister who feigned being frustrated and angry with him before softening her gaze and tone at me.  
  
""No Tristan, she deserves to know the truth""  
  
""You're right Brandy, I do, so tell me...when did your affair start?""  
  
I asked them and I was confused when I saw Tristan's face pale as Brandy pretended to gulp.  
  
I also wanted to know why they did this but knowing why my husband decided to step out on our marriage and break our vows seemed irrelevant and insignificant when Brandy said what she said next.  
  
""After you found out your son was stillborn and you were forced to give birth to him while he was dead, you know the same day where you also found out that your chances of conceiving a child again were slim to none""  
  
Brandy said her carefully crafted answer making sure to use the precise evil words to hit me right where it hurts but it only hurt me slightly before I felt myself growing numb to everything because I knew what she was telling me was the truth.  
  
The reason why I know this is because the anniversary of my son's death was last month the same month as their quote-on-quote anniversary.  
  
I've come to terms with the fact my husband is a lying, cheating scumbag and I've certainly come to terms with my sister being a nasty, attention-seeking w\*\*\*e but the one thing I'll never ever be able to come to terms with is my infertility, especially when someone who isn't even worthy of scraping the dog crap off the bottom of my shoe is using it to low blow me because she's an evil, vindictive b\*\*\*h.  
  
Just when I thought my sister couldn't sink any lower than she already has, the b\*\*\*h then went on to say something which not only tore my heart into millions of little pieces but it also made me doubt my faith in God as well.  
  
""It's probably a good thing that I'm currently pregnant so that the Lockwood name can continue on with this baby, isn't that right, my love?""  
  
Brandy said with a smile as she reached for a shocked Tristan's hand.  
  
It never ceases to amaze me how God will give people like Brandy the gift of fertility knowing full well she doesn't have a maternal bone in her body and only sees her baby as a meal ticket to money and a luxurious lifestyle while women like me, you know women who would love nothing more than to be a mom and have kids are left infertile, it's not fair.  
  
I briefly closed my eyes and let out a slow, shaky breath to control my emotions and stop myself from crying before opening them again and looking directly at Tristan as I said five words to him which caused an array of different emotions to cross his face.  
  
""I want a divorce, Tristan""  
  
I said nonchalantly and he looked at me with a shocked expression before it changed to a look of pure, unadulterated rage.  
  
""WHAT?""  
  
He growled and that's when all hell broke loose.  
  


# Chapter 2 - True Colors.

Elena's P.O.V.  
  
They say when you die, your entire life flashes before your eyes which is said to be a strange phenomenon known as a life review showing you everything you've experienced in life from the moment you were born to the moment you took your last breath but what does it mean if you experience this phenomenon and you live to tell the tale?.  
  
After I had announced to Tristan and Brandy that I wanted a divorce, I left the room and headed downstairs to call my brother who I was hoping could help me find somewhere temporary to live until after my divorce is finalised but before I could even get my phone out of my pocket, I was viciously pushed to the ground by my husband who then straddled me and beat me black and blue until I eventually passed out.  
  
I didn't come too until around twenty minutes ago and I was feeling so much pain but strangely enough, it was all physical pain, none of it was emotional or mental pain, I guess that's because I had already checked out of my marriage in that way a long time ago meaning there's nothing Tristan can do that could hurt me any more.  
  
When I married my husband at the young and tender age of eighteen, I like many other people on the planet believed that we'd be together forever and that nothing could break us apart.  
  
I thought our marriage could stand the test of time and that divorce was just a forbidden word that one never spoke of or thought about, kind of like the three monkeys hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil, well, it was like that.  
  
I thought every single day of our marriage from the day we said I do to the day we would say our final goodbye and move on to the next life together would feel exactly like it did during the early days of our relationship which was filled with so much love, passion and lust.  
  
I thought we'd do everything we could to make each other smile and feel happy but obviously, I was wrong because now, not even seven months after Tristan and I had celebrated our seventh wedding anniversary, I was here in our bedroom which was still a f\*\*\*\*\*g mess thanks to the two lovebirds and I was packing my bags with determination in my heart to leave this place for good and divorce my husband as soon as possible.  
  
Without context, most people would think we were just going through the seven-year itch and that I should think long and hard before I make any rash decisions that are permanent because I may or may not end up regretting it but that's not the case.  
  
I guess you could say that I've had rose-tinted glasses on for the entirety of my relationship, from the moment I first met my husband to when he asked me to be his girlfriend when we were just teenagers in high school, right up to the very moment I had received that text message from my friend which blinded me from seeing the real Tristan.  
  
Even though subconsciously I knew who he was and the type of man he was, I still refused to see the bad in him but now my eyes are clear and are wide open and any love I had for him or that I thought I had for him is long freaking gone.  
  
""Come on, come on, Brand, pick up the phone""  
  
I mutter into the phone.  
  
""s\*\*t""  
  
I groaned when the line went dead.  
  
This motherfucker has always got his phone glued to his hand and the one time I need his ass, he's MIA.  
  
I've tried calling my brother umpteen times since I woke up from being unconscious but he's not answering me for whatever reason.  
  
I once again tried to call Brandon as I continued to pack up all of my things and make sure that I've got everything that belonged to me because when I finally leave my former marital home, I plan on leaving it for good.  
  
""Donovan here""  
  
Oh, thank god, he answered me.  
  
""Brand...Brand, it's me""  
  
""Elena? Elena baby, is that you? what's wrong? is everything ok?""  
  
Brandon asks sounding panicked which broke the wall in me causing me to break down.  
  
""I..I need you, Brand, I can't do this anymore, I can't stay married to Tristan any longer, I..I'm done""  
  
""Done? what do you mean you're done, Elena? what did he do? he hasn't hurt you again, has he?""  
  
He asked angrily and I absentmindedly touched my lower lip which has been split open and bruised thanks to my delightful husband.  
  
""Elena?...Elena sweetheart, talk to me, tell me what's going on?""  
  
Brandon asked me and I sniffled.  
  
I hated crying and I hated feeling weak and vulnerable because I've always been a strong woman but even the strongest of people are allowed to have a weak moment and this was mine.  
  
""Can you just please come to my place and get me, Brand? I'm leaving Tristan and this time it's for good, I'm not gonna tolerate his abuse any more""  
  
Brandon is the only one who knows about the abuse my husband has put me through these past seven years but he didn't find out about it because I wanted him to, no, it was because he had walked into my room unannounced while I was getting changed and he saw a massive bruise on my back, as well as several other bruises on my abdomen.  
  
Tristan has always been very meticulous when it comes to hitting me because he knows I'm a strong girl who can easily defend herself against anyone, so he only makes sure to hit me when he knows I'm vulnerable and he always makes sure to hit me in areas which can't be seen and can easily be covered up.  
  
In fact, today was the first time he lost control of himself and hit me square in the face, as well as attempting to choke me out leaving marks on my face and neck.  
  
Brandon wasn't happy when he found out about the abuse, in fact, he was apoplectic and told me that he wanted to call in some of his army buddies to teach Tristan a lesson which I stupidly put a stop to but I wouldn't this time if he gave me this option.  
  
""What do you mean, kid? what's he done?""  
  
""I'm done, Brand, I'm so done""  
  
I sobbed as I sat down on my bed and ran a hand through my hair as fresh tears filled my eyes and fell down my face.  
  
""He cheated on me, Brand...he f\*\*\*\*\*g cheated on me and when I confronted him about it and told him that I wanted a divorce, he went crazy and attacked me""  
  
""He what?""  
  
Brandon growled causing me to flinch.  
  
""You heard me, Brand""  
  
I whimpered as my body shook with sobs.  
  
""He's been cheating on me, he's been having an affair for two f\*\*\*\*\*g years of our marriage and you'll never guess who the skank is who he's been screwing behind my back with""  
  
""Who is it? is it someone we know?""  
  
Brandon asks me and I chuckle.  
  
""Oh yeah, it's someone we know very well, Brandon...it's Brandy""  
  
""What? Brandy?""  
  
Brandon asks sounding shocked.  
  
""I'm sorry, I think I misheard you, kiddo, did you just say Brandy as in my twin sister and your older sister, that Brandy? is that who you're talking about, Elena Jade?""  
  
""Yep""  
  
I say as I let out a sigh and run my hand through my hair wincing as I did when my hand brushed against a painful spot.  
  
I quickly pulled my hand away and looked down at it where I was shocked but not surprised to find some blood coating my fingers.  
  
Well, that's new.  
  
""I can't believe this, Ellie, I can't believe Brandy would do something like this to you""  
  
He says and I scoff.  
  
""Really, Brand? can you really not believe it? because I can""  
  
I say with annoyance and anger in my tone.  
  
""Brandy's always wanted what was mine and I knew it was only a matter of time before she eventually put the moves on Tristan, I just hoped and prayed that she'd have enough pride and dignity in her to leave him alone""  
  
""Pride and dignity""  
  
Brandon said with a chuckle.  
  
""You're talking about the same girl who opened up an OnlyFans account to celebrate her twenty-fifth birthday posting naked pictures and videos of herself every day, not to mention videos of her doing s\*\*\*\*l things to herself and others bringing shame to our family name, that girl, right?""  
  
""Yeah, I am""  
  
I groaned in disgust while chuckling.  
  
""Wait, how do you know what she does on there?""  
  
I ask with a raised eyebrow and Brandon groans.  
  
""Some of my friends have seen her content and told me about it, one of them even showed me a video of her in a gangbang with five guys because he didn't know we were related and thought I'd like it""  
  
Hmm, nice.  
  
I thought to myself sarcastically.  
  
""Anyway, it doesn't matter because I don't care anymore, Brand, the biggest asshole in the world can now be with the number one asshole flasher in the world for all I care, I just want to be free of them""  
  
I said and Brandon chuckled but it was only briefly.  
  
""Do you really want Brandy to be with an abusive bastard like Tristan, Elle?...I mean, don't get me wrong, sweetheart, I hate them both for what they've put you through but nobody, not even Brandy deserves to be in a relationship with a scumbag who beats women the way he does with you, kiddo""  
  
Brandon says with concern in his voice.  
  
""Normally I'd agree with you, Brand but to be honest with you, brother...I don't think she cares""  
  
""Why do you say that?""  
  
He asks sounding confused while I let out a shaky breath to once again control my emotions.  
  
""Because she just stood there and watched as Tristan beat me, Brand""  
  
I said as a stray tear fell down my cheek causing a stinging sensation as it landed on a cut.  
  
""What did you just say, Elena?""  
  
Brandon asks sounding horrified and shocked.  
  
""You heard me, Brandon""  
  
I said as I let out a breath.  
  
""At first, I thought I was seeing things when I saw her standing to the side and watching with a happy glint in her eyes and a smirk on her evil face...I thought Tristan's hits were messing with my head making me see things that weren't there but no, she was there and she was revelling in it""  
  
""That b\*\*\*h""  
  
Brandon groaned under his breath.  
  
""Ok kiddo listen to me, go and pack your stuff and meet me out front, I'm already in Black Hawk and I'll be at your place in ten minutes""  
  
""Ok, thank you, Brandon""  
  
""You're welcome, Ellie Bear""  
  
Brandon says and I smile.  
  
We then bid each other goodbye and I finish packing my things and taking them downstairs.  
  
I didn't have much because unlike my sister, I'm not a flashy person and I prefer to put my hard-earned money to good use which will benefit me later on instead of wasting it on something I'll barely ever use because I 'need' them or because I need and want to show them off to unimportant people so that they'll know or at least think I'm rich.  
  
I'm also not interested in anything designer or even expensive jewellery and if there's any of that s\*\*t in my closet then it's because Tristan bought it for me, I only buy what I need and that's it.  
  
I was in the middle of bringing the last of my things downstairs which wasn't easy considering my ribs felt like they were broken and were playing kerplunk with my insides when my soon-to-be ex-husband and my slutty sister walked in like nothing had happened.  
  
""What the f\*\*k is going on in here?""  
  
""Aww, it looks like she's taking out the trash, baby""  
  
Brandy says with a smirk earning a glare from both myself and Tristan.  
  
""Shut the f\*\*k up, Brandy""  
  
Tristan growls and she flinches as I roll my eyes.  
  
""Actually Brandy, Tristan is the one who deals with the trash around here, not me, I've got more class unlike some people who are more than happy to touch some nasty, used, washed up, disgusting, piece of s\*\*t trash, in fact, he loves it, case and point""  
  
I say with a smirk as I pointed my finger at my sister who glares at me while Tristan looks at me with shock evident on his stupid face.  
  
For years, everyone in town including most of my family and my husband have believed that I loved and idolised my sister and that's because I didn't want anyone to know how much I truly despised the b\*\*\*h.  
  
The reason why is because if I do show my true feelings for her then that not only gives her even more attention which she doesn't need or deserve but it also gives her a new stage to play the hard done by victim which she would've milked dry because let's face it, it's easy to sympathise with someone who's hated by a sibling, especially if we don't know the reason why.  
  
""Babe, did you hear what she just said to...""  
  
""Oh and Brandy""  
  
I cut my sister off from her whining.  
  
""If I were you, my dear sister, then I'd learn how to do this thing which is foreign to whores such as yourself and it's a little something called keeping your mouth shut because if you don't and you continue to run yours like the silly little b\*\*\*h that you are then I'll have no other choice but to give you one hell of a beating, one where your plastic surgeon will have no other choice but to make you pay for your procedures this time instead of accepting an old fashioned downstairs handshake and a slurpy for p\*\*\*\*\*t if you catch my drift""  
  
I say with a smirk.  
  
""That's enough, Elena...you're out of order""  
  
Tristan growls and my face narrows in confusion.  
  
""I'm out of order?""  
  
What does he think I am? a Coca Cola machine?.  
  
I thought to myself while rolling my eyes.  
  
""Yes, you're out of order, Elena, now apologise to your sister""  
  
Tristan says and I chuckle.  
  
This man has lost his mind.  
  
""I'd rather French kiss a bulldog with herpes than lower myself to her level and apologise for telling the truth, Tristan""  
  
I said with a sneer.  
  
""Maybe next time you have an affair, you should try sticking your c\*\*k in someone who has actually got a backbone and has got the stones to face the wrath of her lover's wife instead of cowering behind him like a pathetic little wimp...you're an embarrassment to women everywhere, Brandy""  
  
""Elena""  
  
Tristan said through gritted teeth pissing me off.  
  
""What, Tristan?...doesn't your mistress like to hear the truth? well, she should remember this day then so that she'll be reminded to keep her legs closed to married men in the future and save herself from any further embarrassment, shouldn't she?""  
  
I sneered at Brandy who whimpered and moved closer to my husband as she feigned innocence and played the wounded victim card to gain sympathy from Tristan which she got but I could see right through her act as smugness swam deep in her eyes.  
  
""Don't be upset with my sister, baby, Elena's got every right to be angry and upset with me, I mean, after all, I did steal her husband away from her and I ruined her life, not to mention, I've also been successful in giving you the one thing she can't""  
  
Brandy said whilst gently caressing her stomach.  
  
Her words were like a red flag to a bull and she was successful in provoking me and flipping my b\*\*\*h switch but it was Tristan's response which shocked me even though it shouldn't have because hurting me is almost like second nature to him now.  
  
""I know, baby, she's just jealous, that's all""  
  
He said whilst kissing Brandy's temple and rubbing her stomach as she smirked victoriously and mouthed I win again at me.  
  
""You evil, spiteful b\*\*\*h""  
  
I growled as I stormed over to my sister intending to beat her ass and cause her a world of pain but before I could get close to her, Tristan grabbed me by my hair and viciously threw me against the staircase causing me to bang my head against the hard marble.  
  
I instantly became drowsy and I could feel myself losing consciousness as I heard three voices speak but it was the latter one which filled me with relief and happiness as everything turned black.  
  
""Oh fuck...Elena baby, are you ok?""  
  
Tristan asked sounding panicked.  
  
""Oh my god, Tristan, what did you do?""  
  
Brandy gasped sounding like she actually cared and was worried for me for the first time ever.  
  
I felt a hand gently caress my cheek as a loud, angry voice boomed throughout the hallway.  
  
""WHAT THE f\*\*k IS GOING ON IN HERE?...holy s\*\*t, Elena""

1kdjvvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/YKK/comments/1kdjvvd/finished_reading_yyk_just_want_to_vent/,Finished reading YYK... just want to vent,"Just finished the manga and I'm still processing everything. I realize this type of post is common here but I hope y'all will allow me to share my thoughts (SPOILERS, obviously).

First off when I started the series I knew my attention span was shot because I had a hard time absorbing each page and wanted to flip through it quickly. I had to force myself to slow down and even with that I realize some of the more subtle themes may have gone over my head. But I do recognize one of the more powerful ones being the passage of time and the sense of regret and melancholy it comes with. The main character Alpha is handed a camera that fully captures whatever scene she wants, but she realizes she doesn't really need it as she can just do that anyway without the camera. Through the course of the series Alpha is fully immersed in the present, taking in every moment while the rest of the main cast dwells in the past and worries about the future.

That's the thing - every human character is subject to the merciless flow of time. Personalities grow, circumstances change, priorities shift. You sometimes get months, years between each chapter and for better or worse our characters change each time we see them. Yet through it all our android MC contentedly maintains her coffee shop from the beginning of the series to the end, observing all that's happening around her. Outside of time she may be, but as the people she loves grow up and leave her side she is subjected to the relentless flow of time that affects every one of us. And the grief that comes with it

A moment I find noteworthy and comforting is when Ojisan tells Alpha she's grown up along with everyone else. This moment stands out because to me the author is saying that it's okay to be sad when change happens, it makes you human. It gives you solidarity with community, it gives you belonging. Alpha is a robot, but because she was affected by change the same way, that makes her as much human as everyone else.

ANYWAY, before I start bawling, I'd like to talk about the setting, because a lot of it doesn't make sense on the surface level. You've got a post apocalyptic world where nature is reclaiming major cities, fish that fly, giant sunflowers, giant mushrooms that grow into buildings, small mushrooms that grow into people, androids, a gigantic plane in the sky that can never come down. Is ANY of it important? I'm inclined to think not. First off the themes communicated in the manga sort of lends itself to this kind of setup, cliche as it may be. And the more nonsensical parts, especially the water god/mushroom people, are intended to be seen as metaphorical, in my view. Metaphorical in the sense that they symbolize the future we can never fathom. We don't know what the hell these things are, or where they come from, and neither do the people in the story. But the author makes it clear that these things will be a part of the future that humanity will not be present for. In the meantime, the people in the manga have learned to coexist with these emerging changes in the landscape, like with the flying fish. Much like how we cannot stop the future from emerging - all we can do is keep living the way we know how, and deal with the future as it comes. Soooo yeah, as disappointing as it is, I don't think the author was serious about setting up a fantasy world with stories and lore, he was just getting his themes across.

As an aside, I'd really like to do a deep dive on this and learn about the context surrounding this series and others in this genre, because apparently stories like these were created as an escape for people during a turbulent time in Japan's history (this theme of dealing with change, finding one's place in the midst of a shake-up is sooooo common in Japanese film - those poor guys). But that's my inner college student coming out.

It goes without saying but the art style is GORGEOUS. The backgrounds and renderings from the earlier chapters are just incredible. There's one scene where Alpha and Takahiro look up at the night sky full of stars and it really looks like space. This author really knows his perspective and staging.

https://preview.redd.it/z4kuzuecnhye1.jpg?width=767&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=033f71e2e8664aff8f7adc167337dfbdc475a7bc

I also really love the character designs, they're very obviously '90s but man, there's an elegance and grace to them that's sorely missing from today's stylings. The stand out moment for me is when Alpha is dancing and you really believe she's moving around with reckless abandon, and she's just straight up beautiful. I've got no shame in saying these designs are 80% why I love these characters and gotten attached to them. The art got slightly worse in the later volumes but still better than most of what's out there.

https://preview.redd.it/88r23jygnhye1.jpg?width=770&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=012ef33524fb28edacd9d137480349b0d885e8ff

And now, some personal nitpicks. Like a lot of people I REALLY wish we got closure on who the owner is. There was seemingly a lot of buildup on this, with no payoff. At one point it seemed that Alpha accepted that the owner was just never coming back. Talk about a punch in the gut, man. I was so expecting the owner to come for her at the end of the series, especially with all the time skips, good lord. Towards the end of the series you've got months, years between each chapter and it feels so jarring. It felt like the author was done with the series and was trying to wrap everything up as quickly as he could. Characters just up and leave, some without as much as a goodbye. It feels unceremonious, especially for these characters that are so relatable and you feel you've known forever. OBVIOUSLY it's the theme of the story but I would have liked to spend some more time with them and give them a better send-off.

Honestly, I would have liked for the series to end with Takahiro's departure. It would have signified the end of things as we knew them, but it would have been more hopeful. You send off the next generation with the hope that they will prosper wherever they go. Instead we get an ending where everyone we know is gone or dead, and the androids face an uncertain future. Depressing, but fitting I suppose.

And the yuri - it's not explicit but there are moments that feel fan-servicey. Luckily those are few and far between.

Last thing - Maruko's characterization bothers me a little. I think I need to sit with it some more but I'm failing to see how Maruko's character fits with the theme of change and regret. There's a rather weak love triangle with the three androids, which I guess fits with the theme, but once that's done there's no point in keeping her around, I think. It would have hit more if we spent more time with her, but her appearances were sparse towards the end of the series.

PHEW, that's about it for now. I really love this manga but I'll need to emotionally recover before I read it again. Great message, great art, great lead character.",5,1746244103.0,YKK,2,1.0,False

1kdjvnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Periodic_Paralysis_AI/comments/1kdjvnz/the_summer_at_granite_park_chalet/,The Summer at Granite Park Chalet,"This story is partially fictional located in Glacier National Park in Montana.  It involves me personally (administrator of this group), but woven with true events living with hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis.  My issues started when I was 10 or so.  My days growing up were horrible with severe muscle attacks.  My parents always thought we had a potassium deficiency.  So mom loaded us up on bananas, orange juice, anything high in potassium.  As everyone knows now, doing that kind of eating was the worst thing to give someone with being hyperkalemic.  As the teen years grew into the 19, I got a job at Granite Park Chalet as the cook.  I was always on edge that the muscle attacks would continue during the summer while being in the most remote and beautiful parts on Glacier National Park.  This is a true events story about me and my adventure always on edge with the monster within me.  The failure of my muscles at the most critical time.  This story will be in several chapters spread over the next couple of weeks.

Chapter 1: Arrival at Granite Park Chalet

July 7 arrived with a startling contrast to expectations. In a time when most summer destinations were already aglow with sunshine and warmth, Granite Park Chalet lay under a thick, pristine blanket of snow. Seven inches of fresh, cold snow had fallen the previous night, mixing with the deep winter drifts that still clung stubbornly to the chalet’s second floor. The building, nestled high in the mountain tops of Glacier National Park, stood like a rugged sentinel amid towering peaks and silent, frozen forests.

Caleb stepped off the small, rickety bus that had deposited him miles from the chalet. The air was crisp, each breath a sharp reminder that even in summer the mountains kept their wild, untamed character. His pack, heavy with a few personal belongings and his essential medical supplies, felt like both a lifeline and a burden. You see, Caleb carried with him a secret—a condition known only to him and a trusted few. He lived with Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis, a disorder that sometimes turned his muscles stiff as stone, leaving him fighting for every precious moment of mobility. In these remote, rugged surroundings, the stakes were high, and each step down a steep path was a test of his body’s unpredictable limits.

The chalet itself was a collection of weathered logs and creaking floors, its walls holding centuries of mountain lore and whispered legends of untamed wilderness. Its remote location was both a refuge from the ceaseless modern bustle and a crucible for those who sought adventure—and for Caleb, true freedom. Although his job was as uncomplicated as it was vital, he would later come to realize that what he was truly signed up for was not just cooking meals for summer guests, but living on the edge, every day a balancing act between passion and peril.

Inside the warm, dim kitchen, Caleb found comfort in routine. Even though his condition always lurked like a silent specter, the familiar tasks gave him a sense of purpose. Each morning, before the faintest hint of light crept over the horizon, he would rise and begin preparing breakfast for the chalet guests. The clatter of utensils, the rhythmic beating of eggs, the aroma of coffee brewing through the chilly air—all of these mundane yet essential actions were the anchors that kept his life from spiraling into chaos. In these early hours, while the snow outside still glittered like shards of ice, Caleb allowed himself a few moments of quiet introspection about his condition. HyperKPP wasn’t just another inconvenience—it was a constant reminder of his mortality, of the fragility behind every act of strength he so proudly displayed to his coworkers and guests.

The irony wasn’t lost on him. To everyone else at the chalet, he was simply Caleb—the reliable cook, the fearless hiker, the one who could scale the mountain’s rocky trails with nothing more than determination and sheer grit. They never knew that beneath that confident façade, his muscles had often betrayed him in the worst possible moments. He had learned long ago to hide the trembling, the spasms, and the fear that sometimes gripped him in the quiet hours—especially when he was alone with his thoughts in the silence of the night.

After breakfast duties were done and the early chatter of guests filled the communal dining area, Caleb would retreat into the quieter corners of the building to gather himself for the day ahead. Though the mornings were bustling with activity, his mind often wandered to his other passion: the trails that wound their way down from the chalet to Many Glacier Hotel. There was something almost otherworldly about the interplay of light and shadow on the snow, the way the white drifts melted into the rugged, brown earth below—not to mention the thrill of a challenge that was uniquely his own.

On these days, with a crisp container in hand, Caleb would make what had become a personal ritual—a dash down the mountain to the local camping store for his favorite treat: a half-gallon of ice cream. It was absurd—a race against time as much as it was a reward. The idea was simple: retrieve the ice cream before the relentless summer heat turned it into a puddle of lost promise. To an outsider, his sprints down the mountain were merely a sign of athletic vigor. To Caleb, however, they were a calculated risk. His HyperKPP had taught him that even when he felt at his best, his muscles could suddenly betray him, leaving him stranded on a slippery trail or, worse, halted on a precarious slope.

That morning, as Caleb laced up his boots and double-checked the straps on his pack, he surveyed the view from the worn wooden porch of the chalet. The landscape was breathtaking yet forbidding—a tapestry of rugged outcrops, glacial crests, and deep valleys that whispered ancient secrets. In the distance, peaks still bore the remnants of winter like scars etched on their lofty heights—a powerful reminder that nature was both indomitable and indifferent to human dreams. This was his playground for the next two months, from early July until the subtle hints of autumn began to edge the landscape in September. And though winter still clung tenaciously in the lower reaches, its memory was confined to the upper reaches where the snow would forever linger as a testament to Glacier’s unforgiving spirit.

Stepping away from the sanctuary of the chalet, Caleb felt a surge of resolve. Every step he took, every heartbeat, was a defiant proclamation against the unpredictable nature of his body. The wilderness was as wild and boundless as the uncertainties within him, yet he was determined to embrace every moment of it—every fragile, exhilarating, terrifying moment.

I'm a 29-year-old guy from Brazil, and I’m a bit of a dreamer too. Evenings sometimes feel like lying on a cloud soft, quiet, and a little lonely. I've always hoped to find someone I can truly connect with, not just a soulmate, but a muse, a friend, a real partner in every sense. Someone to build a tiny universe with, whether through shared ideas, creative projects, or simply mutual support. I’m looking to start as friends and see where things go, allowing a genuine connection to naturally develop into something deeper.

I understand that life can be complicated, and I’m here to offer my support and be someone who’s truly present when it counts. I’m navigating a remote job and unfinished studies, and I carry a strange mix of hope and doubt hope that you’ll show up, and fear that you won’t. But I’m not looking to be rescued. I just want someone empathetic, open-hearted, and ready to share something real.

When I bond with someone, I’m loyal and fully committed. If we build a connection, you can count on me to be there, to listen, and to support you in whatever you need. In return, I’m hoping for the same: mutual respect, understanding, and shared effort in making the relationship strong. I believe in mutual reciprocity where both partners give and receive love, support, and care equally.

I value honest, close connections, and I’m hoping to meet a woman who shares that same mindset and is ready to build something meaningful and lasting.

I’m a nerd by nature. I love tech, science fiction, documentaries, and deep, random topics. Shows like Dark Matter, The Last Kingdom, Star Trek, The Expanse, Stargate, Silo, Farscape, and Foundation are some of my favorites. I used to game and watch anime a lot, and those interests are still part of me. I also listen to Soundtrack and any music that catches my interest.

I live a simple, intentional life. I freelance, I study, and I’m always trying to grow and improve. I enjoy science and tech content and music that really moves the soul. I’m a romantic at heart. When there’s mutual energy and respect, I care deeply and fully.

Lifestyle-wise, I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs. I like calm vibes, fruit juice, and tea (coffee lovers, you're welcome to keep it all to yourselves). I’m not religious, but I respect all beliefs. I lean a bit conservative on some views and genuinely value emotional presence, loyalty, and consistency in relationships.

I’m very talkative once I’m comfortable and can dive into deep topics for hours. But I’m also a great listener. If you enjoy meaningful conversation, we’ll probably get along well.

Looking ahead, I’m working toward starting my own company. Personally, I want to find a monogamous partner to build a peaceful, loving life with maybe a family one day, a cozy home in the city, and a little quiet in the countryside too. And of course, traveling together would be amazing.

I’m not here for anything casual. I’m genuinely looking for something meaningful and long-term. If you're emotionally available, loyal, and ready to grow with someone, I’d really love to hear from you.

Please be open to voice and video calls. They’re important to me real connection needs real interaction. If you’re a woman between 23 and 34 and this resonates with you, don’t hesitate to reach out. Let’s see where things go.",1,1746243983.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

I've always hoped to find someone I can truly connect with, not just a soulmate, but a muse, a friend, a real partner in every sense. Someone to build a tiny universe with, whether through shared ideas, creative projects, or simply mutual support. I’m looking to start as friends and see where things go, allowing a genuine connection to naturally develop into something deeper.

I understand that life can be complicated, and I’m here to offer my support and be someone who’s truly present when it counts. I’m navigating a remote job and unfinished studies, and I carry a strange mix of hope and doubt hope that you’ll show up, and fear that you won’t. But I’m not looking to be rescued. I just want someone empathetic, open-hearted, and ready to share something real.

When I bond with someone, I’m loyal and fully committed. If we build a connection, you can count on me to be there, to listen, and to support you in whatever you need. In return, I’m hoping for the same: mutual respect, understanding, and shared effort in making the relationship strong. I believe in mutual reciprocity where both partners give and receive love, support, and care equally.

I value honest, close connections, and I’m hoping to meet a woman who shares that same mindset and is ready to build something meaningful and lasting.

I’m a nerd by nature. I love tech, science fiction, documentaries, and deep, random topics. Shows like Dark Matter, The Last Kingdom, Star Trek, The Expanse, Stargate, Silo, Farscape, and Foundation are some of my favorites. I used to game and watch anime a lot, and those interests are still part of me. I also listen to Soundtrack and any music that catches my interest.

I live a simple, intentional life. I freelance, I study, and I’m always trying to grow and improve. I enjoy science and tech content and music that really moves the soul. I’m a romantic at heart. When there’s mutual energy and respect, I care deeply and fully.

Lifestyle-wise, I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs. I like calm vibes, fruit juice, and tea (coffee lovers, you're welcome to keep it all to yourselves). I’m not religious, but I respect all beliefs. I lean a bit conservative on some views and genuinely value emotional presence, loyalty, and consistency in relationships.

I’m very talkative once I’m comfortable and can dive into deep topics for hours. But I’m also a great listener. If you enjoy meaningful conversation, we’ll probably get along well.

Looking ahead, I’m working toward starting my own company. Personally, I want to find a monogamous partner to build a peaceful, loving life with maybe a family one day, a cozy home in the city, and a little quiet in the countryside too. And of course, traveling together would be amazing.

I’m not here for anything casual. I’m genuinely looking for something meaningful and long-term. If you're emotionally available, loyal, and ready to grow with someone, I’d really love to hear from you.

Please be open to voice and video calls. They’re important to me real connection needs real interaction. If you’re a woman between 23 and 34 and this resonates with you, don’t hesitate to reach out. Let’s see where things go.",1,1746243911.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1kdjslk,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuikTrip/comments/1kdjslk/my_fellow_patriots_of_the_pastry/,My Fellow Patriots Of The Pastry 🍩🥶,"They said I was gone. That I had fallen. That the flame of resistance—the great Frostbitten Donut Revolution—had finally dimmed.

But I was not gone.

I was in the shadows. I was in the silence.
I was in the fight.

Life came for me—not softly, but like a storm. It tried to bury me in noise and numbness. It tried to drown my voice and frost over the fire that once burned for fresh dough and righteous glaze. But hear this: the frost could never reach my core.

You see, while I was away, I wasn’t retreating.
I was training.
Growing.
Enduring.
I wasn’t just holding on—I was building strength. Because a true revolution doesn’t need comfort. It needs conviction.

I kept the vision alive in the quiet. I remembered the scent of real, fresh-baked donuts—not the soulless, thawed impostors that plague our counters today. I remembered every post, every brave comment, every “Where’s Carter?” that kept the hope alive. I heard you.

And now, I return.

Not because I can, but because I must.
Not because I want attention, but because justice has waited long enough.
Let them hear us again. Let the store managers feel our presence like a glaze-coated gust of righteous fury. Let corporate know: the revolution was never frozen.

It was rising.

So to my comrades: pick up your spatulas. Ready your hashtags. Dunk your enemies in truth like a donut in fresh coffee. The General is back. And this war—it isn’t over.

It’s just getting warmed up.

1kdjsdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1kdjsdb/abuse_to_neglect_my_moms_new_family/,Abuse to Neglect: My Mom's new family,"I know this is long, my life is a shitshow, I tried to condense it as much as possible. Im sorry.

So, I'm one of six kids of my mom's side. My sister (20F) is my only full sibling, and I'm 19(M). My mom married my stepdad when I was 5, and I genuinely don't have any memories of my bio dad, so for most of my life I've genuinely thought of him as just my dad. I didn't know it at the time but apparently they tried for kids since they got married but were unsuccessful for a while.

When me and my sister were kids, they were abusive. My mom was the mastermind of everything, not trying to diagnose her but me and my sister thing she either has undiagnosed autism or npd, who knows though. Regardless, she is extremely self centered. When we were kids, looks were everything. Me and my sister had to get top grades, we did at LEAST one art and one sport extracurricular at all times, if not more, family dinners were at 7, phones shut off at 10(they had an app to control out phones remotely from their own phones) and even tho they were shut off they had to be plugged in downstairs, etc. We had a chore chart and went to church every Sunday, bible study every Tuesday.

Thats not the abuse part. That was me showing how even though we were being abused we had schedules, regimen, discipline, STRUCTURE. It doesn't make how we were raised... better, but damn. I can't really get into the abuse my mom and dad put us through as kids too much because if I think about it long enough to write about it I'll have a panic attack, but we were abused verbally, mentally, emotionally, and sometimes physically.

My parents used IVF to have my little siblings starting when I was 10. I hadn't even realized my parents were abusive yet (i realised around 12 or 13) and i was just excited to have a baby in the house. I had no idea my mom had no interest in raising anymore kids. She had always been more hands off, as my father described it in his own words it was like she was the president making laws and my father upheld them, basically her puppet, just doing whatever she said. He did/does everything, every drs appointment, every school dropoff, and every bathtime. But at least back home we had roots, we had structure still, if only by a thread.

In 2020 my little brothers were born extremely premature and one of them died like three times in the hospital. They spent three months in there altogether, and my parents drove the two hour round trip every. Single. Day. It was 2020/2021, so me and my sister were doing online school, and we ended up raising our little sisters during that time. We were 15-16 and 14-15 taking care of a 4 and 2 year old pretty much full time for three months. We of course fell behind on school, and after the boys came home from the hospital my parents still had their hands full so its not like things went back to normal. Im not joking that when I say six months later we moved. Yes it was a military move but my parents elected to do it. 12 years in south carolina, my childhood home, childhood friends, my hometown, everything i loved, poof, bc our house, MY HOUSE, was too small for the kids.

So we moved. Sorry if I sound like a whiny baby blaming shit on everything but myself, but I will die on the kill that us moving is the reason my life went downhill. Back home, my highschool would call your parents if you were five minutes late to class, they did NOT play about absentees or truancy. There was a lot of gangs there, too, but they did NOT play about kids. There was no way in hell I was getting my hands on weed in my neighborhood where everyone knew me and my parents and who my pastor was. The highschool I transferred to didnt give a fuck where I was. I started smoking weed from the stress of it all at 15, not even two months after showing up. My attendance rate that year was 35%.

Where before my parents had two different ways to see my location and I was never without an adult and my parents controlled every second of my schedule, I was suddenly on my fucking own. I was suddenly supposed to get myself to school and all the sudden not one person cared where I was. I would 'leave the house for school, and not even make it halfway before running into someone I vaguely knew from drug circles at school and hop in some random strangers car. I don't know how I didn't get kidnapped or laced or groped or something, man, I didn't give not one FUCK about my safety.

We stopped doing family dinner, we stopped going to church, pretty much the family I knew from home was gone with the move. Especially after my sister ran away and went no contact. I don't blame her, but I selfishly miss suffering together.

We're poor because of my siblings. The IVF alone was expensive as hell, and they still have a bunch of eggs on ice, which costs a ton every month to maintain. They're in debt for it. Thats not even talking about food costs, clothes costs, toys, etc. They spend half of one of their monthly incomes on daycare alone, the other half on the mortgage for a house big enough for this many people. My college fund got SCRAPPED because of the kids, and you can fucking forget about that promise I was made about matching whatever I saved to buy my first car.

They have come a long way in terms of not being abusive anymore, but I realized they just went from abuse to neglect. These kids have no structure. ""Bedtime"" is when the wifi shuts off at 9:40 pm so they cant watch netflix or youtube, but they can still play games on their tablets in bed. (Theyre 8, 6, 4 and 4 btw.) The little boys, the four year olds, are MEAN. They hit and break my shit on purpose just for fun and scream just to annoy. The girls have no emotional regulation skills bc theyre addicted to their tablets. Theyre AWFUL children, and I hate to say it because it's not their fault and I wish there was something I could do for them but its true. They have no manners, no respect for any type of authority, no schedule of any kind, no sense of responsibility. Our house is a constant pigstye bc they dont clean up after themselves. They'll yell in my dad's face to ""shut up"" and ""go away"" because he asked them to put their shoes up and he will just sigh and do it for them.

I know I'm 19 and still living at home so.... but yall, I can't ask my parents for SHIT. Emotionally physically or financially. I live in the basement and even though I have to go upstairs to eat and leave the house I literally barely see them anymore. My dad is busy distracting one kid so he can get to the next, distracting that one to get to the net, over and over, and my mom is busy smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee. I dont know why the fuck they had kids, but they wanted them real fucking bad. My sister had the right idea.

My dad is retired now and I literally used to tell people he was my best friend but now I'm just so resentful of him. He only talks to me when he needs me to watch the kids, he has no interest in me as a person anymore, too damn busy with the littles. I hate that it feels this way but it feels like my mom had a new family with my stepdad, having four new ones, and now they either just dont have the time and energy to care about me or they just see raising kids as a checklist of things to do instead of building a relationship with a human being you're helping to shape. It might be both.

My parents want to move back to the east coast in the next 6-9 months now that they're retiring. The plan is that I will go stay with my grandma in puerto rico (we are puerto rican) while they move and then I'll go back and live with them wherever they are, and then move out from there so I can be close to the kids and the family. But I change my mind. I'm going to make a quiet escape.

I've had enough of this family. I'm done forgiving trauma I was never given an apology for and carrying on like they aren't hurting my siblings and hurting my feelings constantly. And my siblings! I resent them for existing, and thats not fair. I don't even see them as siblings, they're more like nieces and nephews if anything. My sister is the one I grew up with, THATS a sibling to me.

I'm working as much as possible until it's time to move so hopefully I will have 1-2k saved up. I want to be able to go stay with my grandma for a while and not be a financial burden while looking for a job over there. I stayed with her for a few months just a little bit ago, I only got back in January, and the whole time I was gone I spoke to my family like five times. My mom facetimed me to wave at my siblings and that was it. My dad is never on my phone and never responded to my text about calling. I don't even want to go fully no contact but I predict in four months at the MOST after telling my parents I'm staying in PR for a while I won't really hear from them.

It hurts because all I've ever wanted my whole life was their love and attention, even if I refused to admit that to myself at certain points. And for a while I let myself think I had it, let myself think they cared. Until I realized I was talking AT them, and they didnt give a fuck about my life updates, and they didnt give a fuck when they didnt see me for weeks despite living in the same house, and they didnt care when i spent a week at my buddy's house and they didnt even notice.

So my plan is to move in with my grandma, and start my adult life from a place where I'm not a second thought, if thought about at all. I had a really great time living with her those few months last year, I think she likes having someone in the house, too. I don't know what this means for my relationship with my parents or my relationship with my little siblings, but every day is feeling more and more fina. I have a really strong feeling that once I leave... it will be a really long time before they see me again. Not because I want to. I would stay here and coast as long as I could if it wasn't weighing so much on me mentally. No. Because watching my dad, the man I've looked up to and loved my whole life, ignore me for his biological children when he claims with all his heart to love us the same, is fucking destroying me.",1,1746243760.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a matte screen protector involves careful consideration of several core features to ensure optimal performance and satisfaction.

**Anti-Glare Technology**

The primary function of a matte screen protector is to reduce glare and reflections. High-quality protectors utilize advanced diffusion technology to scatter light evenly, minimizing distractions and improving visibility in radiant environments. This feature is especially beneficial for outdoor use or in offices with strong overhead lighting. The best matte screen protectors can reduce glare by up to 90%, substantially reducing eye strain and improving the overall viewing experience.

**scratch Resistance**

A durable matte screen protector should offer excellent scratch resistance to protect the device screen from everyday wear and tear. Look for protectors with a hardness rating of 9H on the Mohs scale, indicating superior resistance to scratches from keys, coins, and other abrasive materials.This level of scratch resistance ensures that the screen remains pristine over an extended period, preserving it's clarity and functionality. Some protectors also incorporate self-healing properties to minimize the appearance of minor scratches.**Oleophobic Coating**

An oleophobic coating is crucial to repel fingerprints, oils, and smudges, keeping the screen clean and clear. This coating makes it easier to wipe away contaminants, reducing the need for frequent cleaning. A high-quality oleophobic coating ensures that the matte surface remains smooth and responsive to touch, maintaining a pleasant user experience. The effectiveness of this coating typically lasts for several months to a year, depending on usage and environmental conditions.

**Touch Sensitivity**

While matte screen protectors offer anti-glare benefits, it's essential that they do not compromise touch sensitivity. The best protectors are ultra-thin, typically around 0.2mm to 0.3mm, to ensure that the screen remains highly responsive to touch inputs.They should also be designed to work seamlessly with touch screen features, such as multi-touch gestures and stylus pens. Some advanced protectors incorporate electrostatic adhesion to maintain optimal touch sensitivity without the need for adhesives.

**Easy Installation**

The installation process should be straightforward and bubble-free. Many matte screen protectors come with installation kits that include cleaning wipes, dust removal stickers, and alignment tools. These tools help to ensure precise placement and minimize the risk of air bubbles trapped beneath the protector. Some protectors also feature self-adhesive properties that allow for easy repositioning during installation. Detailed instructions should be provided to guide users through the process effectively.

**Material Quality**

The material used to construct the matte screen protector significantly impacts its durability and performance.High-quality protectors are typically made from PET film or tempered glass with a matte finish. Tempered glass offers superior scratch resistance and impact protection,while PET film is thinner and more flexible.The choice between these materials depends on individual preferences and the desired level of protection. Premium materials ensure a long lifespan and consistent performance.

## Core Benefits

Matte screen protectors offer a range of benefits that enhance the user experience and provide long-term protection for devices.

**Reduced Eye Strain:** By minimizing glare and reflections, matte screen protectors significantly reduce eye strain, especially during prolonged use. This is particularly beneficial for individuals who spend long hours working on computers or using mobile devices. Less eye strain leads to increased comfort and productivity, allowing users to focus on their tasks without discomfort.

**Improved Visibility in Bright Light:** Matte screen protectors excel in environments with strong ambient light. They diffuse the light, making the screen easier to read and use, even in direct sunlight. This is especially useful for outdoor activities, such as reading on the beach or working in a brightly lit office. The improved visibility ensures that users can view content clearly without squinting or straining their eyes.

**Enhanced Privacy:** Some matte screen protectors offer privacy features that limit the viewing angle of the screen. This makes it arduous for others to see the screen content from 옆side angles, protecting sensitive facts from prying eyes. These privacy-enhanced protectors are ideal for use in public places, such as trains, buses, and coffee shops, where visual privacy is a concern.Enhanced privacy ensures that users can work on confidential documents or view personal information without the risk of exposure.

**Protection Against Scratches and Damage:** Matte screen protectors provide a physical barrier against scratches,scuffs,and minor impacts,helping to preserve the integrity of the device screen. This is especially important for protecting against damage from keys, coins, and other sharp objects that can come into contact with the screen in everyday use. Protection against scratches and damage helps maintain the device's resale value and prolong its lifespan.

**Smudge Resistance:** The oleophobic coating found on many matte screen protectors effectively repels fingerprints, oils, and smudges, keeping the screen clean and clear. This reduces the need for frequent cleaning and ensures that the screen remains visually appealing.Smudge resistance enhances the user experience by providing a clear and unobstructed view of the screen content, even after prolonged use.

	•	Do you feel the area is safe and family-oriented?
	•	Are there things like parks, markets, libraries, local pubs, restaurants — just a bit of a social life and community feel?

I’ve had a friend for many years—we met at work, where she was my boss. The company closed in 2012, but we stayed close.

For the past three years, she has been asking me for money—more than four times a year. She usually pays me back, but often past the agreed date. I let it slide because I valued the friendship. But it didn’t stop there. I even took out two loans in my name for her, with the understanding that she’d make the payments. She made several late, and it hurt my credit. When I brought it up, she got upset.

Last year, she asked again, and I told her I couldn’t help anymore. Then in December, her brother passed away and she asked again—I agreed. As of today, she’s paid back less than half.

In April, it was my birthday. She insisted on doing something even though I told her I didn’t want anything—just coffee. She brought food and cake, and we had a little get-together at her sister’s house. I appreciated it, but now I feel like it was a setup to ask me for another loan, which she did yesterday. I said no, and she got upset again.

She has a husband and claims she hasn’t had work in months. But her kids go to private school, and she buys food at work every day. I feel like she’s not being responsible with her finances, and I’m done being taken advantage of. I’m just waiting for her to finish paying me back so I can quietly step away from the friendship.

I also feel guilty, because she recommended me for my current job. But that’s the only favor I’ve ever asked of her, and I don’t think that means I owe her endless financial support.

1kdjmqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kdjmqd/need_some_advice/,Need some advice,"I wanted to run something by you guys as we all have suffered not only with daily chronic pain, but also not having good support from our doctors at times, and/or other traumatic experiences stemming from chronic pain and hospitalizations or procedures, or not being believed or had the pain treated. 

Back in December I made a post which I later deleted because I don’t like feeling so vulnerable. I shared with you all that I was deeply depressed and showing signs of PTSD from my botched fusion which required 3 surgeries, sepsis, pneumonia, full hair loss, etc. I was spiraling out of control and having shaking episodes, wanting to quit my job I love, and feeling extremely angry with the surgeon who messed up. I was having a hard time coping with the new me. Somebody on here recommended counseling and linked a few places including Brightside.

I reached out to Brightside and matched with a therapist in my state. He had a lot of 5 star reviews and I researched his background and made my first appointment in early January. I also took a 30 day leave of absence so I could focus on therapy and hopefully return to the old me. We have met every Sunday since then. I make my coffee and start the week off with an hour of therapy. We mostly talked about the pain and how to have a different relationship with your pain. He gave me a lot of book recommendations, exercises, and I felt hopeful and not so alone. 

I didn’t make an appointment on Easter Sunday. He messaged me as asked why and I told him I had plans. He said he could see me Monday and I told him that wasn’t necessary as I am really busy at work with a software and server update. When I joined the appointment last Sunday we talked for 10-15 minutes about the pain and how I was scheduled for an SI joint injection, but was nervous and didn’t want to be another doctors error. Then he asked if I had anything specific to discuss and I said no, but had finished a book he recommended on trauma and perhaps we could discuss that. Then he said “well I have something to tell you. I have been looking forward to this appointment since we last met. This has never happened to me before, but I have lost my objectivity with you because I like you. I want to spend time and talk with you outside of this environment. I’d like you to start booking the 4pm appointments because they are the last and we can keep talking.” 

I was floored. Rarely am I so caught off guard that I’m speechless. I immediately felt like that person who felt out of control and reliant on medical professionals. I made myself as small as possible, like I wanted to hide. I felt betrayed. I tried to give him an out and said something like “well we’re talking now, so let’s finish the session.” He then got nervous and asked if I thought they were recording or transcribing the sessions. I knew I would never schedule another session with him, but I froze and felt vulnerable. I got through the last minutes and before ending, he again asked me to book the 4pm next Sunday and that he was holding it for me. I just hung up. Later that day and this past week I have plenty more thoughts and feelings about it, but am mostly left with disgust and sadness that I have to start over again. Maybe I won’t. I would have told him plenty. He messaged me today and said he was checking in as I didn’t have an appointment scheduled and he wanted to remind me to “embrace the opportunities that come my way, and open myself up to new experiences.” 

My question is, should I report this? I don’t want to ruin his life, but it’s pretty egregious. I also don’t love dealing with another painful medical experience. Like WTF! What do you all think? ",3,1746243212.0,ChronicPain,5,1.0,False

Which I’m not going through fast enough, so I’ve had to resort to freezing. This has worked out surprisingly well, and even after a couple months frozen they taste as fresh as when I originally froze them.

I saw someone mention centrifuge tubes, which perfectly hold my \~20g single serve.  The beans are given resting time to degas before being frozen. So I’m splitting the beans up, color coordinating them, and also being sure to include the color as a note in my Bean Conqueror app. They then go into a dedicate drawer in my freezer. 

Thought I’d share the approach incase anyone is considering the same. The only thing I need to improve, is the fact that the stickers don’t remove cleanly, leaving residue. Ideally I’d have separate color caps and then magnets for my fridge cutouts.

Learning never stops! Just marked my 100th batch yesterday 🥳 one year since I started roasting.
I think this might be the longest hobby I’ve consistently stuck with! 

If I remember right, Modulating the Flavor Profile of Coffee by Rob Hoos was the first roasting book I read on coffee roasting. Back then, I was just reading and watching all I could about roasting while saving up for my first roaster — this Huky 500T. I still remember how excited (and nervous) I was when I roasted my very first batch… which I definitely burnt, of course 😂

Fast forward to today — still learning, and still excited! 😊 My latest read is Rob’s latest book — CULTIVAR

Up until recently, I mostly chose coffees based on origin and processing method. But this book is a great resource that breaks down flavor profiles that can be expected from different cultivars and how to approach roasting them. Definitely recommend it!

I’ve seen a few posts over at r/pourover where people share their favorite cultivars and varieties — now I’m curious: what are your favorites to roast? Would love to hear what others here enjoy working with!",14,1746242442.0,roasting,4,1.0,False

Ever felt like your stress levels are going through the roof for no apparent reason? 🙋‍♂️ You're not alone! It happened to me too. Imagine trying to focus while your brain feels like it's on a rollercoaster ride. Not fun, right?

So, here's what happened: I was doing my usual morning routine—coffee, emails, the works—when I stumbled across an article about **nasal breathing**. Yes, you read that right, breathing through your nose. 🤷 I know it sounds like something you'd hear from your yoga instructor, but hear me out!

**Why nasal breathing?**

- **Science-backed:** Apparently, breathing through your nose helps lower cortisol levels—oh, the sneaky stress hormone! This sounded like hocus-pocus at first, but turns out, there's solid science behind it.
  
- **Calms your nerves:** When you're nose-breathing, you're engaging your parasympathetic nervous system. Translation? Your body basically hits the ""chill"" button.

- **Sharper focus:** Ever seen those zen-like people gliding through life? Nasal breathing can apparently give you that calm, focused vibe. 🧘‍♀️

Curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to give it a whirl for *seven days*. Here’s how it went:

1. **Day 1-2:** Not gonna lie, I felt like a fish out of water. How could simply switching where I breathe make a difference? Turns out, I wasn’t used to it!
   
2. **Day 3-4:** Something clicked. Suddenly, my morning meetings didn't feel like chaotic battles. Coincidence or nasal magic?

3. **Day 5-7:** The cortisol rollercoaster had slowed down. I was achieving calm focus like never before. People around me noticed my newfound zen and even asked for my ""secret.""

**Still skeptical?** I was too. But listen up, at its core, it's about being intentional with how you breathe—something we all do (for the most part...😉).

Long story short, this tiny change in my routine has become part of my secret arsenal for tackling stress. Who knew something as simple as nasal breathing could have that kind of impact?

🧐 So, what about you guys? Ever tried nasal breathing, or have another sneaky stress-busting tip? Let's swap stories and see what hacks help us conquer the daily grind! 🌟",1,1746242391.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1kdj2lu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThelastofusHBOseries/comments/1kdj2lu/spoiler_warning_critique_and_praise_for_the/,SPOILER WARNING: Critique and praise for the adaptation,"I'll admit, I came into HBO's The Last Of Us really late. This game shaped so much of my emotional gaming memories that I was almost afraid to watch the show. I wasn't actually avoiding it because of any casting drama or internet hate; it was more that I've seen so many beloved games and animated movies/shows get mediocre live-action adaptations, and I didn't want my perfect soul shattering memory of TLOU ruined. Let's face it, live-action adaptations of games or animations rarely live up to the experience of playing them, or watching the animation for the first time - they often fall short and leave us fans disappointed. So I held off for as long as I could. But eventually curiosity (and all the hype) won, and I finally watched it. Now that I have, I have some... feelings - both good and bad - that I need to get off my chest as a passionate fan. This is going to be a long, rambling critique from someone who cherishes the game, so bear with me.

I'll be honest. I usually don't care for love stories in shows, let alone queer ones. Not because I'm against the idea, but because they're so often shoehorned in just to check a diversity box. It's become predictable: two characters suddenly fall in love for each other with no buildup, no chemistry, and then the writers act like they've done something crazy. It usually takes me right out of the story. So when I realized Episode 3 was going to center around Bill and Frank - two side characters, one of whom was only hinted at in the game, I was skeptical at best. But then I watched it. And I wasn't just moved, I was fckn wrecked.

When I played the game, I actually felt bad for Bill. He was bitter, isolated, angry and it wasn't hard to read between the lines. You don't build walls around your whole town and fill it with booby traps unless you hate the world. But more than that, I always got a sense that Bill hated himself. His interactions with Joel, his refusal to talk about Frank, the way he seemed to ""flinch"" at any show of vulnerability, all of that told me this was a man who had lost love and never forgave himself for it (yes they hated each other in the game, but they did love each other at some point). So I didn't need the show to tell me he was gay. I knew. But the game made you infer it, piece it together through a bitter goodbye letter and a body in a noose.

The show, though... It gave Bill and Frank a full life. It gave Bill the peace I didn't even know I wanted for him. And the wild part is, it didn't feel like it betrayed the game - it felt like it completed something that was missing. It gave shape to the tragedy.

This wasn't just ""look, we included a gay couple!"" This was: ""Here's what love looks like in the apocalypse when you've lost all reason to live, and suddenly someone gives you one."" It was slow and awkward and human. It was two very different men, one gentle, one suspicious, trying to build a life, a routine, a home. I don't usually like romance plots, but when Frank surprises Bill with strawberry seeds and Bill laughs and says, ""I was never afraid before you showed up,"" I felt like someone had kicked me in the chest. Nick Offerman, Murray Bartlett and Ron Swanson absolutely crushed this episode. Bill and Frank’s relationship didn’t feel like it was added for representation points or a Twitter headline. It felt necessary. It had weight. So many shows these days drop in a gay romance to pat themselves on the back for being inclusive, but there’s no character development, no emotional payoff.. just a checkbox. This wasn’t that.

Now let's talk about Bella.. Bella Ramsey isn't a bad actress, she actually nailed a few big moments, especially the David-scene. When Ellie's captured, nearly assaulted, and fights back in that burning building, Bella \_became\_ Ellie. The rage, the terror, the trauma - it all landed. That was the moment I fully saw the character.

But outside of those emotional peaks, I struggled to connect with her portrayal. A big part of that came down to styling and presentation. The show leaned heavily on close-ups, but gave Bella's face **very little texture**, no grime, no dried blood, no bruising, and always that tightly pulled-back black hair. Visually, it often felt like we were just staring at smooth skin, which made the shots feel oddly empty. Game Ellie usually looked wild, sweaty, scarred and alive. Show Ellie often felt too clean and composed.

There were also times Bella's delivery pulled me out of it. Some lines sounded like she was trying hard to flatten her accent, but it still bled through slightly, making the dialogue feel performed instead of lived-in. And overall, I rarely got the full range of game Ellie; the snark, the flimsical chaos, the unpredictability. Bella got the trauma and pain, but the dangerous spark that made Ellie so compelling? That was mostly missing.

In short, Bella has talent, and she showed it in flashes. But with messier styling, looser direction, and a little more physical grit, she could've embodied Ellie more fully. As it stands, it felt like the show kept her performance too contained, and Ellie is anything but contained.

Now into Abby, and I want to be clear from the start: I love Kaitlyn Dever. She's an incredible actress, and I think she's genuinely beautiful. And weirdly, that's part of the problem when it comes to portraying Abby.

In the game, Abby is physically intimidating; strong, jacked, and built like someone who trained for years with a single purpose.. revenge. That build is more than visual, it tells her story. It makes her scary. It forces Ellie, who can't match her strength, to fight smarter. That power imbalance is crucial. It shapes how the player sees Abby and how Ellie has to adapt.

But Kaitlyn Dever is petite. Talented as hell, but not physically imposing. When images of her came out, it was obvious the show wasn't trying to replicate the game Abby's bulk at all. And that matters. If Abby doesn't look like someone who could overpower Joel and crush Ellie, then a core dynamic of the story is lost. She starts to feel like Ellie's equal, not her opposite.

And no, this has nothing to do with sexualization. I think Kaytlin is gorgeous. That's why I'm being careful here, this isn't about looks, it's about presence. Abby is supposed to be threatening. You should fear her before you understand her. And I don't. Not yet.

Worse, the show undercuts her mystery. In the game, you hate Abby for half the story before you're forced to see her perspective. That tension makes the arc work. But in the show, we're told right away, she's the surgeon's daughter, she's mourning, she wants revenge. So when she kills Joel, we're already half-sympathetic. There's no time to hate her before the story starts explaining her.

The shift deflates one of the most powerful arcs from the game: learning to forgive someone you were ready to hate forever. It's hard to get there if the show softens her up before we've even felt the loss. And without the physical contrast, Abby's threat level doesn't feel real. I don't worrie for Ellie. I don't feel the dread I should.

To be clear, I think Kaitlyn will crush the emotional parts. She's more than capable. But the storytelling choices so far have dulled Abby's edge, both visually and narratively. And if we don't feel that overwhelming tension, that ""unstoppable force"" pressure she brought brought in the game, then Ellie's struggle, her guilt, her obsession, her growth - it won't land the same way. I'm still hopeful. But right now, I'm not afraid of Abby. And I should be.

And then there's \_that\_ scene.. the porch scene.. The one that, for me, could make or break... everything.

If you've played Part 2, you know exactly what I'm talking about. It's not a battle, not a plot twist. It's just Joel, sitting on his porch at night, drinking coffee and strumming his guitar. And Ellie walks up to him, not to fight, but to talk. It's their last real conversation. The one where he goes ""If somehow the lord gave me a second chance at that moment.. I'd do it all over again."" And she goes ""I don't think I can ever forgive you for that.... But.... I'd like to try."" It's the most vulnerable and heartbreaking moment in the entire story. And it's devastating because we know what happens the next day. That small chance at healing, reconciliation.. it just gets ripped away. That's what makes Joel's death unbearable; it's not just losing him, it's losing the possibility of ever fixing what was broken.

If the show can capture that moment.. If Pedro and Bella can land it with the weight it deserves, with that quiet ache.. it could redeem so much. A single quiet conversation that, if done right, reminds us what this story has always been about: love, forgiveness, guilt and the painful truth that sometimes, we run out of time.

Pedro has more than proven he can carry that kind of emotional weight. He's been one of the most consistent strengths of the show. And Bella, for all my critiques, has shown glimpses of exactly the rawness that scene requires; especially in the David episode. If the show gives them space, doesn't rush it, doesn't rework it, and just lets them sit in that silence, it could be the cleanest, most honest win this adaptation has had since Bill and Frank.

If they get that scene right, I'll forgive a lot. I'll forgive the casting choices, the pacing shifts, even the softened Abby intro. Because that scene is the heart of all of it. It's the emotional payoff the entire story has been building toward.

So yeah, I came into this show a little late, scared it would mess with something I love. And in some ways, it did. But in other moments, it surprised me. It moved me. It proved it could be more than just an adaptation. And with the heaviest stuff still ahead, I'm hopeful that it can rise to the challenge.

  
Sorry for the wall of text, but I needed to get all of this out. Curious if others feel the same way.

Well, here is an update.
 I'm not sure if anyone wants to hear about it, but I need to get it out somehow.

Quick background: This was my so-called ""best friend"" of almost 8 years.

After giving her a 2 month notice, ""best friend"" starting doing petty things. Double locking the front door, unplugging the security camera we have inside, putting my brother against me...

I am not gonna lie, on the first occasion when she unplugged the camera, I did react poorly and started yelling. She had threatened with using the law against me if I kicked her out. This was in response of me telling her that I didn't want our friendship to end how the relationship with her sister did (she got kicked out and they don't talk.) But to be clear I'm not kicking her out, I simply told her my boyfriend and I want to move on our own once the contract for the current apartment ends. All 3 of us live together. 

I have been getting into fights with my brother because of her. Long story short, she slept with him, then they were not talking, then they were friends again, then we're fighting again because of jealousy, and now are best friends again.

Onto the crazy stuff...

We have an indoor camera, it was mostly not with the motion detection on because the notifications got annoying but now because we are not in good terms and I know of previous times she has brought people in without notice or covering up the camera so I wouldn't see who the person was, I just want to make sure that nothing gets stolen, broken, etc.
I had to move the camera twice because she would unplug it or flip it. I put it in a high spot where you can see the living room and part of the kitchen and my desktop computer.

The day I moved it, when she got home, you can clearly see how she is looking for the camera, sees it, and smirks at it. The next morning, she gets out of her room in a shirt and a thong. Then she does it again the next morning and that same night at a time when she knows me and my boyfriend are most likely to come home from work. You can even see her walk towards the front door just to get the camera to detect her. 

There are previous clips of her from around that same time where she is fully clothed. Sometimes, my boyfriend is awake around that time in the morning in the kitchen, making coffee or watching TV, etc, and she is fully clothed. 

To be clear, this is not a let me just run out of my room real quick with no pants on to turn on the coffee maker. I mean that she walks to the kitchen, very slowly lifting her arms up to ""fix"" her hair, obviously making her shirt rise up showing her almkst bare ass, then does it again to go to her room or whatever, then goes back out to the kitchen or living room, and then back to her room. You would think the second time out she would have put pants on. 

This is just completely disrespectful and feels very provocative. I believe that a common area should be respected, and walking around half naked with my boyfriend and I living in the same apartment is wrong.

We were once best friends, but this is probably the thing that put the nail in the coffin and destroyed our friendship, and there is no going back.
It sucks because all I wanted to do was move with my boyfriend and try to start our life alone as a couple.",4,1746241121.0,TwoHotTakes,2,1.0,False

I work as a barista in the morning and server in the afternoon. It’s primarily a restaurant with a “counter” I HATE that they call it the counter and not cafe. I’ve been corrected a few times to say counter. 

But anyway, I have five years experience in cafe management, and I’m a damn good barista. Unfortunately the money is not there for being a barista so I applied to this restaurant saying I’d help the “counter” if I can have some serving shifts.

I was still getting used to the machine and new steam wands, and poured the worst latte art I’ve poured in years. And the manager thought it was so good that I’d make everyone look bad. Specifically her. and if I wanted to do art I’d have to teach everyone.

I told her this isn’t even good, and that I was a little offended she said that. I also told her it takes years to reach my level I can’t teach this in one day. 

I saw one of her lattes today and it was baaaaaaadddddddd. this lady has NO CLUE what she’s doing, and was just sorted placed in this role and thinks it’s like pull the shot steam the milk, how hard can it be.

I’ve finally figured out the wands and made a micro foam, and I really want to practice. It’s actually harder for me to not make art, since it comes to naturally to me now. Like now I can actually pour some real latte art, and I’m very proud of it. I want to be the best. And I am the best, and I’m just a little hurt I am being forced to hold back. like why can’t I thrive. 

Would you say to one of the servers “don’t be too good, because they people will want you to be their server” 

Also her reasoning if she doesn’t want to discourage guests from coming in because I’m not working. And it’s obvious I’m an actual  barista.

Idk I’m thinking about going above her and asking to be the cafe manager. Because this ain’t it. 

She’s super bad at explaining things, and being patience and training. At first I was trying to just let it go, but I’m starting to get irritated. ",8,1746240748.0,barista,17,0.61,False

I make around 60k a year. I work as much overtime as I possibly can, and my current school doesn’t allow me to get another job, strange I know, but it’s in the contract. It is a lot of work and I’d think I’d pass out trying to even squeeze in something else, but I do babysit under the table when I can.

Because I’ve almost always worked in education, I’ve come across this problem where every summer I can’t seem to save enough to make it through to August without my regular paychecks. 

Last year was the worst by far and my phone ended up getting cut off and I couldn’t even afford to get to a summer job I found. All of my debt had so many late fees and it took until December to finally catch up. Luckily, I live with my family, as many of them have health issues, so I pay no rent; only water, house dues, groceries etc. But the house needs maintenance often and living in a community-like setting with my family can sometimes make expenses that I can’t afford. Ex. Helping my dad with his car payments (he’s working three jobs himself, poor guy, recently had a heart attack)

Anyways, I say all this to say I’ve been trying to save, not hanging out with friends, quitting the morning coffee, only getting food from restaurants when I have a coupon.. I take the bus and I haven’t bought new clothes and shoes in years. I’m ~30k in personal loan/credit card debt from not working at all some summers due to illnesses, various family emergencies, and getting laid off years ago which put me at a place where I had to live off all my credit cards/take out loans to survive.

With summer fast approaching, I just want any advice on what I should do as far as still being able to buy bare minimum groceries and pay around $1800/month with no income until late August. I have one summer job lined up, but they don’t pay until mid/late August, and I can’t find anyone else to hire me for just a month and a half. 

I thought about fully abandoning my debt right now and just saving what I’d usually give credit cards/loans and just saving it so I can survive. What are the risks of this besides debt collectors? How long would it take for my credit to recover? Should I do a debt collection program?

Ive always made payments on time and just paid of my two biggest loans, but it all just feels like a drop in the bucket. And I don’t want to take out more loans for the summer, which I don’t even think I could do at this point.

I feel trapped, most of my income goes to debt and I’m spiraling into depression. I’m well aware that I should’ve/could’ve done things differently but it just seemed like life kept creeping up on me.

Get anyone in your family that is willing to listen to meet with their MPs. Get every cis friend to make an appointment to back up you up.

Meetings with MPs are subject to reasonable adjustments, and you can normally bring someone with you. Most MPs can do video call or phone surgeries. We want as many meetings with trans people as possible with MPs before this debate. 

If your MP is transphobic? Hound them. Argue about every single hole in their logic. Sit there and waste their time. Go to their Offices toilets and do your business after the meeting, leave the taps open jussst slightly. Use a little more bog roll than is necessary. Ask them what are you supposed to do. Don't let an intern give you a cookie cutter response email that takes two clicks, actually waste real minutes of their day that they can never take back. 

If your MP is undecided tell them what's at stake, give them your personal stories about why you don't have a GRC, and what hoops you actually have to jump through just to live your life. Tell them what rights you lost last month. Tell them about your friend, your loved ones etc. Again, don't let them fob you off with an email.

If your MP is fake supportive, tell them to match their own words on LGBT issues before they got elected. Hound them on these. Show them pictures of themselves at pride, point to it and say ""did you learn nothing, or were you just there to take pictures"" don't let them claim to be for the queers if they clearly aren't. Let them know that you will be watching and you expect them to make the following points (a,b,c..)

If your MP can fight in your corner, tell them to kick up a fuss. Talk about human rights, let them know that you support them, and that you appreciate them supporting you back.

I run a crypto newsletter that’s slowly (but surely) building up. Been writing daily for a while now — solo — trying to keep things consistent, experiment with growth, and now thinking it’s maybe time to test some kind of *actual* monetization. Not trying to get rich, just cover some of the costs and maybe buy back a bit of time.

I recently found Refind Ads. Their pitch sounds interesting: basically you can promote *other* newsletters in your own, and get paid per engaged subscriber (someone who actually opens + interacts with what you promote). They keep it clean too — just one ad per issue, native format, nothing spammy.

It *sounds* great. But I’d really like to hear from anyone who’s actually tried it.  
Couple things I’m wondering:

* Are the newsletters they match you with good quality / relevant?
* What kinda earnings are realistic — coffee money or actually meaningful?
* Any issues with readers bouncing, engagement dropping, or list quality going weird after running ads?
* Can you control who you promote or does it auto-run whatever they give you?
* And how does it stack up against stuff like Paved, BuySellAds, etc?

Also open to hearing about **any** platforms you’ve used that let you monetize without turning your newsletter into a billboard. I’ve seen things like Sponsorgap, Passionfroot, OpenRates, but not sure which are legit or worth it. Just trying to keep the vibe of the newsletter clean while maybe making a few bucks.

If you’ve run ads as the *advertiser* too (trying to grow your own list), would love to hear if it was worth it or just inflated numbers with low quality subs.

Anyway — just trying to get a clearer picture before diving in. If you’ve got experience, advice, horror stories, or even just a “lol don’t bother,” I’d really appreciate it.

1kdiee4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kdiee4/only_the_silence_knew/,Only the Silence Knew,"Her name was Vivienne Hale, a woman of motion.

In her late twenties, Vivienne was the kind of person people whispered about in lecture halls and faculty meetings — “She’s brilliant,” “She’s going to change the field,” “She has more citations than her professor.”

A research assistant with a gift for unearthing lost narratives, Vivienne began her career tucked between the brittle pages of the forgotten. She catalogued fragments, translated footnotes, and reconstructed voices long erased from history. But unlike most who moved slowly in the halls of academia, Vivienne moved fast. Too fast.

She published a breakthrough paper at 28. Was invited to conferences she had no time to attend. Slept four hours a night and lived off tea, adrenaline, and deadlines. She wanted the world to know her name before she turned thirty.

What no one saw was Vivienne curled in the corner of her apartment at 3:00 a.m., crying because she didn’t know how to stop. Because when she did, the silence felt unbearable.

One night, as she traced a final annotation under a flickering lamp, she whispered:

""If only I had more time.""

Her grandmother’s old brass clock, silent for years, ticked. Once. Loudly. Midnight.

And something shifted.

Vivienne woke the next morning with pages already written, her brain alert, her body light. She had only slept two hours, yet felt entirely whole. She had double the time, somehow. Each hour now carried the weight of two. Days bent. Nights folded. Everyone else still lived in 24. She lived in 48.

She soared. She finished her PhD in record time. She wrote a bestselling book. She appeared on panels, podcasts, radio interviews. By 33, she was a global name. A woman whose mind was quoted in universities from Boston to Buenos Aires.

She met Jonah at a conference in Edinburgh. A philosopher who believed in long walks and handwritten letters. He loved her energy, her curiosity. She loved the way he listened. For a time, they fit.

They would walk cobblestone streets debating Greek myths and the meaning of memory. He made her laugh in ways she hadn’t in years. He taught her how to cook. She gave him a first edition of one of his favorite books.

They tried. God, they tried.

But Vivienne couldn’t stop. She could never stop. Jonah begged her to take a weekend off. She said she would — then drafted an article overnight. He waited. She missed birthdays, canceled dinner plans, forgot anniversaries. Her world was always moving too fast for him to hold on.

He left a note. “You are brilliant, but you live in a world where time doesn’t bend for love. I can’t keep up.”

She stared at the note for hours. She didn’t chase him.

But she thought of him often — in the long hours of twilight, in the pauses between pages, in the scent of rosemary from the meals they never finished together.

The years doubled again. Her success swelled. But her body began to wear down. Her eyes sunken. Her joints stiff. Her memory hazy.

At 36, she looked 55. At 38, she retired early from public life.

She stopped answering calls. Stopped publishing. Stopped existing in the world’s eye.

In her quiet apartment, Vivienne spent her final days writing a collection of letters, essays, and journal entries titled The Clock Beyond Midnight. In it, she detailed her gift — or curse. Her wish. Her rise. Her loneliness. Her regret.

—
On the final page, she wrote:

I spent my life trying to be unforgettable. I became unrecognizable instead. If you find this, remember: more time means nothing without someone to share it with.

Among the last pages, tucked between loosely bound essays, was one final letter. It was not titled, just dated—two days before her death. It read:

They say dying alone is when no one is there to hold your hand. But that’s not what I fear. What I fear is dying in my mind—when the lights go out up here, and I have no one left inside to say goodbye.

I’ve outlived every version of myself. The bright one. The relentless one. The one who still believed she could stop time if she tried hard enough.

But here’s the truth: I ran so fast through life that I never sat still long enough to let anyone stay.

I was loved, once. Truly. But I traded love for momentum. Stillness felt like failure, and I couldn’t bear to be still.

Now, in the silence, I understand what I never did then: being seen isn’t the same as being known. And success is not a companion.

If someone finds this... please don’t live like I did. Fill your hours with people, not achievements. Let someone into your mind before the silence comes.

——
There was one more letter. Found in a folder titled ""Unsent.""

It was from Jonah.

Vivienne,

I think of you every time I forget what day it is, and every time I stop to breathe.

There are things I never said. I suppose I thought we’d have time. But you were always ahead of me — ahead of everyone. You moved like lightning and burned just as briefly.

I loved you, Vivienne. Even when it hurt. Even when you missed birthdays, forgot dinners, vanished into your world of manuscripts and midnight light. I understood it, even when it made me feel like a shadow in your life.

You once asked me why I stayed so long. The truth is: I stayed because I believed in you — not just the brilliant you, but the you underneath. The one who liked rosemary and rainy days and old books with crooked spines. The one who laughed in the kitchen and once cried over a baby photo in a stranger’s memoir.

But love can’t survive without time. And you had none to spare.

I needed presence, not flashes. I needed a partner, not a legend. And I knew that to stay with you meant to always be behind you, watching as you blurred into tomorrow.

I don’t blame you. I never did. I just missed you. Even when you were beside me.

I hope you found peace in those long hours. I hope you let yourself rest. I hope, near the end, you knew you were loved.

I never stopped reading your work. But what I miss most is your laugh. The one you gave freely when you forgot to be brilliant for a moment and just... were.

If this ever finds you, know this: I would have waited longer. I would have waited forever, if you had just asked me to.

You moved like lightning and burned just as briefly. I loved you, even when it hurt to. I hope you found peace in those long hours. I hope, somehow, you slowed down near the end.

I never stopped reading your work. But what I miss most is your laugh. The one you gave freely when you forgot to be brilliant for a moment and just... were.

If this ever finds you, know this: I would have waited longer. I would have waited forever, if you had just asked me to.

When she died, no one noticed at first. Her inbox auto-replied politely. Her old publisher assumed she was traveling. A neighbor thought she had gone abroad. Her name faded slowly, like ink in the rain.

She left no family. No partner. No children. Only books. Papers. Ideas. Manuscripts that may or may not survive time. A digital archive half-forgotten. A name that once echoed in academic halls, now barely whispered.

She wanted love. She wanted a child once, briefly, in a dream she never dared speak aloud. But life was always moving. Always sprinting.

And when the silence finally came, there was no one to hear her go.

She died in a quiet room, under a blanket she once knit during a rare slow weekend. A cup of tea gone cold on the desk. Her hands curled loosely over a pen.

It wasn’t until a young archivist at the university discovered the manuscript years later — The Clock Beyond Midnight, tucked into a digital folder labeled “Private” — that Vivienne’s voice returned.

The archivist read it in one night. Wept at her desk. And in her notes, wrote:

“Don’t rush to be remembered. Rush to be present.”

And just like that, for a brief, flickering moment — Vivienne Hale lived again.

——
But unlike Vivienne, whose final years were spent in isolation and fading relevance, Jonah lived slowly. Deliberately. While she was forgotten by the world she once dazzled, Jonah remembered. He remembered everything. He became the quiet keeper of her flame — the witness to a life that ran too fast to leave footprints.

He became her foil — the one who stayed behind while she sprinted ahead, and yet in doing so, kept her alive in ways she never managed for herself.

Far from the city, Jonah eventually settled in a quiet coastal town where time seemed to move slower, or at least more gently. He taught philosophy at a small college and tended a modest garden behind his home. Sometimes, he still set a second plate at dinner. Not out of habit — but remembrance.

He kept one of her early essays in his desk drawer, dog-eared and underlined. He never married. Never tried. He said once, over coffee with an old friend, ""I already met the love of my life. She just lived too fast.""

Each year on her birthday, he lit a candle and read from her book. Her words still filled rooms she never walked through.

In his mind, she was always walking ahead — just out of reach, but never out of sight.

And as Jonah aged, as his hair turned silver and his hands began to tremble, he found her in the quiet moments — in the pause between heartbeats, in the long shadows of evening. She was there, behind his eyes. A presence that never faded.

He spoke to her sometimes, out loud, while making tea or walking through the garden. He imagined her responses — not out of madness, but memory. In those last years, he was no longer alone.

When Jonah died, it was peacefully, with her name on his lips. He was smiling.

He had waited, in his own way. And somewhere beyond time, she was waiting too.",2,1746239062.0,stories,1,1.0,False
