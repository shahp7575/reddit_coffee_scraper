It's goody Friday happy Friday whatever it's called Easter is around the corner so we're busy on average we keep one cashier open and I had a good flow going to the point we didn't need a second. A lady comes into my line her totals 10 something she's upset she lost her money she's paining with coins. I get it it happens but she doesn't want to count it. First bit was less then three she opened up another baggy no were at 4. Forth baggy and were not even at 5 i can tell because all she had was pennies. She finds her money im like okay she'll pay with that nope she wanted to use coins that clearly wasn't making taking her anywhere so I told her to count it out. She got upset and called me an evil b word. The lady behind her is offering to pay because she's grown impatient it's been 15 minutes. The lady got even more upset and said we were calling her broke and how she had money proceeds to wave her cash bills around so I said then pay with that instead of holding up the line or I can have the order canceled. She ended up paying but she called me a b through out the whole experience by the end I was shaking the things I wanted to say and do but didn't she left her coffee and came back like I was going to save it for her. Nope go pay with your coins for another one.

‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre into trying new cuisines, movies, travelling, and occasional partying

We tried Bumble BFF but it quickly turned into people sliding into DMs with not-so-friendly intentions üôÑ So now we‚Äôre here, asking internet strangers to be our friends - totally normal behavior, right?

‚Ä¢	People who enjoy going out but also appreciate a good Netflix binge

‚Ä¢	Folks who don‚Äôt make plans only to cancel last minute (the bane of adult friendships)

1k2bbch,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1k2bbch/coughingvomiting_blood/,Coughing/Vomiting Blood,"Hey everyone,

Basic background:

24M - Heavy smoker/Non drinker - Hypertension - Gastric Sleeved 1 year post-op - Lung nodule (3mm) found 1 year 3 months ago - Gallbladder removed and some other that I‚Äôve been through. Out of country for 3 months now, will be back in 2 weeks. 

2023 Dec, started coughing blood at mornings. It got worse so 2024 Jan went to a hospital, scan showed 3mm lung nodule found. Doctor couldn‚Äôt specify the blood‚Äôs source. Eventually it stopped. 

2 days ago, woke up with a iron taste in mouth and a funny stomach. After about 30 minutes got like sweaty feeling then went to vomit. Hurled couple times and stomach acid mixed with -i believe- fresh blood, even a part that is a cloth. 

My surgeon suggested me to watch my stool to see if it turns black and if it does, go to a hospital. If not, it could wait. 

Yesterday, i sipped a wrong coffee. Because of the taste in my mouth, i spit and saw blood again. Mind you that both of these are just little volumes of blood, not like I am bleeding non stop. Definetly more than a few drops but thats it. 

15 minutes ago I had dinner and I believe I ate a bite too much and had the urge to throw up. As I throw up my dinner for the millionth time in 1 year again blood comes out with it. 

I‚Äôve had this before. It was nothing to be worried about and I don‚Äôt want to pay a hospital bill in a foreign country. 

The question is; Do you think it is urgent that I should seek medical assistance or can I wait until I go back to my own country to my own doctors. My surgeon, the doctor initially found the nodule etc. It‚Äôs not a money issue, just sick of going to hospitals since I had maybe 60+ last year, I want to have ONE vacation without an ER or an ambulance.

**AITAH For breaking my Number 1 sex rule with a handicapped guy?**


So TL/DR for the ‚Äúgive me the bare bones, I don‚Äôt have all day to read on the shitter‚Äù crew: My #1 sex rule since high school has been no sex before the third date. I recently broke that rule with a handicapped guy, and now my childhood best friend is pissed and grossed out because she thinks I have some weird kind of fetish.

Context/full story: I‚Äôm a 28f. My childhood best friend we‚Äôll call Jess is also 28f. To put it simply, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm any kind of prude, I just don‚Äôt really feel comfortable with casual sex, never have. My best friend knows this and has teased me about it lightly in the past. She‚Äôs been in a long term relationship for the last 3 years, I‚Äôve mostly been single while working on my degree and starting my career. Jess lives in another state with her boyfriend, so we don‚Äôt hang out much anymore.

So about a month ago I had a first date with a guy I‚Äôd been talking to for a bit, thought it was going places, but he gave a WEIRD vibe on the date and I cut and ran early. On my way home I stopped at a local pub, figured I‚Äôd have a drink to unwind and people watch till it wore off. (Tipsy driving is still drunk driving IMO.) I get there and it‚Äôs pretty packed, Friday night and all, and there was no seating room at the bar. Took my drink and looked around, most of the ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù side of the pub was someone‚Äôs birthday party, but there was a small table with a seat open off to the side, with a guy reading a book there. So I say eff it, I‚Äôm a social person and what‚Äôs the worst thing that happens, he says no? So I ask if I can sit there for a bit, I promise we don‚Äôt have to talk or anything.

At this point I feel like I‚Äôve fucked up because this guy up close is the hottest man I have ever seen. But he just smiled at me and gave an enthusiastic ‚ÄúSure!‚Äù A few minutes later of me sipping in silence and he says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind talking, if you want to.‚Äù (Yeah I want to are you kidding me right now?) We talk for a bit and it turns out Mike (fake name) is 29, just finished his master‚Äôs degree in some kind of computer learning field (‚ÄúI program computers to program computers‚Äù) and he‚Äôs living on his own for the first time. He apparently stops by the pub after work because he‚Äôs right around the corner, and he‚Äôs not used to the silence yet after living so long with a half dozen siblings.

We talked for a good two hours, about everything from dating (which he said he‚Äôs basically given up on) to hobbies and tastes, and we have a near total eclipse of a venn diagram on this stuff. I eventually sort of blurted out that I don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôd give up on dating, this is the closest thing I‚Äôve had to a good date in forever. (Shooting my shot obliquely here lol.) He gets kind of an odd look on his face and says ‚ÄúTell you what, I have to go to the bathroom, but when I come back I‚Äôll ask you out for real.‚Äù Weird, but okay?

Then it all clicks, because he doesn‚Äôt get up to walk away, he just rolls. In his wheelchair. And I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúoh my God he wanted to give me a chance to back out of this without making it awkward how cute can this guy BE.‚Äù He grinned like crazy when he got back and saw I was still there, and I basically tripped over myself saying something to the effect of ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm free all weekend, what did you have in mind?‚Äù

Another hour later, we‚Äôve got plans for Saturday, and he told me he has a neuromuscular disorder I can‚Äôt remember the name of (my degree isn‚Äôt in STEM lol) so his legs work, but the signals from his brain get misinterpreted so he doesn‚Äôt have the balance or coordination for walking or standing. The pub starts switching over to the younger/rowdier crowd and he asks if I‚Äôd like to go back to his place for coffee to continue our conversation.

As you have probably long since realized, I did not get any coffee or conversation till the next morning and I have ZERO regrets. We‚Äôve been dating since and I know it‚Äôs still early but I really feel like this might be the one.

Onward to yesterday afternoon, my friend Jess (remember Jess?) is in town, and we go out for coffee to catch up on things. I‚Äôm gushing about Mike, but when I get to how we met she just sort of got weird and edgy. I don‚Äôt remember any exact words but she essentially said that I must have a fetish for the handicapped since I broke my #1 rule and it‚Äôs the best physical relationship I‚Äôve ever been in. Like it‚Äôs good for me because he uses a wheelchair, not because the guy puts in effort in bed??? She said I‚Äôve ‚Äúchanged‚Äù as a person and left without even saying goodbye. 15 years of friendship and I‚Äôve never seen her like that.

So here I am, asking the most objective people online (haha) if I‚Äôm an asshole or weird for being super attracted to a guy who uses a wheelchair and basically putting out immediately.


**Update - 2 days later**

My first ever update! Yay! Uh, so if you were hoping for some terrible drama, I hate to break it to you that I don‚Äôt roll like that. No pun intended. So I do have an update on Jess and shit finally makes perfect sense. And I have a slightly NSFW but funny story about Mike, because this guy is just the best, y‚Äôall.

Okay, so first, I finally messaged Jess yesterday and said basically ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still hurt by what you said, but after 15 years of friendship I‚Äôd never forgive musif I didn‚Äôt at least ask why you snapped at me like that.‚Äù She replied immediately, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so fucking sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean any of that, can we have a do over on lunch?‚Äù So I agreed cautiously and took a half day to meet with her today.

Turns out that those of you who said she was jealous, and that she might have something else going on, and especially the person who said something might be going on in HER relationship‚Ä¶.. gold stars. She‚Äôs in town because she‚Äôs job hunting, because she‚Äôs moving back in with her parents for a while since her relationship ended. Apparently they have been having a ton of small problems adding up, but the biggest one? Sex. The guy she‚Äôs been with was apparently never great but it‚Äôs gotten to the point where he makes no effort at all for her to enjoy herself and then gets pissed when she isn‚Äôt in the mood.

She tried talking with him about it, making suggestions but he told her recently that it‚Äôs ‚Äúemasculating‚Äù being given sex advice by a woman. The straw that broke the metaphorical camel‚Äôs back, however, was that her boyfriend has always had a thing for Asian women. She‚Äôs caucasian, but she does have long black hair. After weeks of fighting over their sex life, he suggested that they spice things up‚Ä¶.by her dressing in a kimono and pretending to be Asian. She lost it on him and is absolutely disgusted by the racist fetishism and ended it right then.

So she had allllll of this bottled up and was hoping to talk to me and finally be able to put it down‚Ä¶.. and I missed every hint that she had something big to discuss because I was gushing about Mike. So to her it felt like I was just twisting the knife by bragging about how great our sex was. She snapped, and somewhere between what I was saying and what she wanted to talk about some wires got crossed and she said something incredibly dumb.

She left without saying goodbye because she was mortified and ashamed as well as irrationally mad at me. Something to know about Jess, she‚Äôs an awful liar and she and I were the co-founders of our high school‚Äôs ‚Äúfoot-in-mouth‚Äù society, so I do believe her. I told her I forgive her and I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt realize she wanted to talk about something bothering her, and she said I was too stupidly nice and have nothing to apologize for, so I think we‚Äôll be okay. For the time being I‚Äôm not ready for her and Mike to meet, because I don‚Äôt want to make things feel worse, and she agrees. But she‚Äôs really really happy for me. Hopefully this is just a funny story we can look back on someday.

So, on to how Mike almost killed me, lol. Last night we were talking about the reddit post and he gets this funny expression that I‚Äôm starting to recognize. And he goes ‚ÄúHow do we know you don‚Äôt have a fetish if we haven‚Äôt at least tried it in the chair?‚Äù And I‚Äôm like ‚Äúare you serious lol‚Äù. He said he‚Äôs never attempted it, because (cue tears) he‚Äôs never felt so comfortable with a partner before. Well.

His chair has what is essentially like a parking break thing. Or it should, it‚Äôs unfortunately broken and apparently getting them fixed is an expensive pain in the ass. He doesn‚Äôt use it that often so he hasn‚Äôt made it a priority. And there‚Äôs this thing called Newton‚Äôs third law, you know how every action has an equal and opposite reaction? As it happens, when you‚Äôre trying to, ah, get the motion of the ocean going, in a chair with wheels that aren‚Äôt locked, there‚Äôs a sort of counter motion that starts and fucks it all up. So we were going nowhere fast except for inching along the floor in his bedroom. And laughing at the silliness, which isn‚Äôt helping. Eventually he just stops and says ‚ÄúMaybe we can get some of those wooden block things they use to keep little planes from rolling away, like in Indiana Jones you know?‚Äù

I absolutely lost it. Like laughing so hard I‚Äôm in tears, he‚Äôs giggling half at the situation and half at my reaction, and everything just keeps setting me off again. FINALLY I get it under control, doing some deep breathing exercises and shit, and I look at him again. And he pulls the straightest face he can, and says, for the love of god, ‚ÄúGolly. This sure is uncomfortable.‚Äù Folks if I had asthma I would have fucking died right there. I laughed so hard I think I pulled a rib. Like wheezing and not even laughing anymore so much as weeping and making this awful ‚Äúheeeeee‚Äù noise when I could catch my breath. While he‚Äôs laughing and rubbing my back and saying he‚Äôs sorry, he couldn‚Äôt resist.

So yeah, confirmed, no fetish here, and this magnificent bastard‚Äôs comedic timing might actually kill me.


**Update - 1 month later**


So first up, you know what people (at least me) don‚Äôt think about when dating a guy who‚Äôs always sitting? Height. I know he‚Äôs taller than me because we cuddle a lot, and he‚Äôs taller sitting on the couch, but I didn‚Äôt reeeeeeally get it. So we drive up Friday night after work (actually south and west, lol, but to my brain it‚Äôs always up) in his vehicle, which is modified to be driven entirely using his hands. Neat, right? He‚Äôs a really good driver too. One more green flag. We get to the house, and it‚Äôs‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs huge you guys, LOL like not a mansion, just kind of a sprawling one floor rancher. Real estate was wild back in the day.

Anyway we get out, and I meet his mom. I‚Äôd like to point out I am no slouch, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô-friggin-7. His mom is TOWERING over me. But she was the nicest lady ever. We go inside and I meet his dad (who funny enough is apparently the only short one in this family) and his youngest sister, who is living there with his one year old niece. She gets up to hug me and SHE IS ALSO REALLY TALL. It‚Äôs already a bit late then, so we eat and head to bed, I get to see his cute as shit room from when he was a teenager, and I casually ask ‚Äúhey, so uh, I don‚Äôt know how this works and stuff, but how tall are you?‚Äù and Mike is all ‚ÄúI dunno, like a bit over 6‚Äô4? Been a while since I checked.‚Äù A BIT OVER 6‚Äô4. ‚ÄúSo, is everyone in your family tall?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶..kinda?‚Äù

We met the Nordic Basketball team he calls a family properly the next day. (Actually they‚Äôre Irish, but they‚Äôre blond and tall so it conveys the idea better.) The ONLY one of reasonable height, and still taller than me, was his oldest sister, lol.

They are also LOUD. Like not really shouting or anything usually, just, PRESENT. Mike is a lot different around them, but in the cutest way, like he just beams all the time and you can see how happy he is to be home. One of his brothers put him in a headlock and gave him a dang NOOGIE as a greeting, and got elbowed in the side for it, and all of them laughing. And his mom smacked one of his brothers with a rolled up magazine for putting his feet on the table. More laughing. Just‚Ä¶ intimidating but in the happiest way imaginable. I‚Äôll admit I was a little shut down for a bit, but Mike kept checking in with me to make sure I was okay, and they were all really nice, so I got into the spirit after a bit.

I mentioned this in another comment, but Mike has a special sports wheelchair he uses for, well, sports. And he and his siblings play basketball. And he is GOOD. Apart from just having a hell of an arm, he‚Äôs quick as hell. And this magnificent bastard that I love will absolutely, purposefully, GLEEFULLY run someone‚Äôs toes over. He AIMS for it. They all have this yank-back-the-foot maneuver that‚Äôs hysterical to watch.

So it was this crazy day of loud people playing and having a blast, nieces and nephews running around, and just noise. My ears are still ringing. The food was catered in advance because his mom ‚Äúhad seven babies, all I make on mother‚Äôs day is margaritas.‚Äù They also have a pool, it‚Äôs a bit chilly still but the pool is HEATED so we actually all got to swim, which was a lot of fun because I got to show off that I too am athletic‚Ä¶. I can do a backwards somersault off a diving board! Yeah. I‚Äôm a real catch lol. They at least pretended to be impressed.

We all stayed up late drinking and bitching that it was too overcast to see the aurora (boo) and I had the worst hangover I‚Äôve had in a while on Sunday. We slept in a bit late, and then joined Mike‚Äôs family for the BBQ part of the BBQ weekend. His dad can GRILL, people. And he‚Äôs fast, food coming off the grill at lightning speed. I asked Mike about it and he laughed and said ‚Äúthere was seven of us to feed. Ever see a nest of baby birds? He had practice.‚Äù Which, fair enough.

I don‚Äôt have much experience with babies, but I got to hold his youngest niece (the one living at home with his sis until her husband gets back from deployment) and we had a light talk about kids in the future. I told him that I never put much thought into it but if they were going to grow up in a happy home like his and not how I grew up, I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôd be open to having them with him someday. But later. I need him all to myself for a while first. He seemed really really happy about that, which makes ME feel all goofy and happy. I‚Äôm sappy.

We had to drive home Sunday night, but before we went his mom hugged me and said she‚Äôs NEVER seen her son like this, and thanked me for taking good care of her baby. And asked if we‚Äôd be back for the 4th of July or if we were doing something with my family. And I tried to be all ‚Äúhaaaa no we‚Äôll be here if you don‚Äôt mind, I don‚Äôt see them much‚Äù and I think she caught on that there‚Äôs more to the story so she just hugged the shit out of me (vikings, all of them I swear) and told me she can‚Äôt wait to see me again.

My ears are still ringing from all the noise and chaos, but it was an absolute blast and I can‚Äôt wait to see them again in July. Also, pretty much sure Mike is the man I‚Äôm going to marry. I literally can‚Äôt think of a single reason why I would ever let him get away.

Anyway thanks for reading, hope you all had a lovely weekend, and those of you who got to see the aurora I‚Äôm happy for you but you suck, lol.

**UPDATE (again) Dating a disabled guy: 4th of July**

No we aren‚Äôt engaged yet. Yes we have talked about it in the context of how seriously we are taking things. No babies yet either obviously, we are diligent about birth control. I want Mike all to myself for a while.

So, the 4th of July visit to his family‚Äôs house was pretty awesome. After getting to know everyone last time I had better expectations of what I was going into, and I‚Äôve talked with my therapist about the whole ‚Äúplay fighting makes me anxious because in my childhood home it wasn‚Äôt playing‚Äù thing. I don‚Äôt want them to ever curb how they act to cater to me, and instead I guess I‚Äôll consider it immersion therapy. I think Mike mentioned it anyway because I didn‚Äôt see much of it this time, though there were cheerful threats of doom lobbed about which I didn‚Äôt mind at all.

His mom is amazing, I‚Äôd like to point out. Even if she moms so hard it makes me weepy. So, background info: I have a really common sounding name spelled REALLY uncommonly. Think Danyell or Jessikah. Because in addition to everything else my parents decided to be creative when they named me. So, although I do sort of like my name, that meant I was that kid who never saw their name personalized on anything. Mike‚Äôs family, on the other hand, had like a million kids and they all got traditional names, so personalized stuff was huge for them (it kept them from fighting over stuff I guess.) One of the things in their house, because they have a pool, is that each of the kids (adults now) has their own personalized beach towel that lives at the house.

So we get to their place and it‚Äôs been a hot drive there, so right after we get in Mike suggests I go to his room to get changed into a swimsuit so we can have a dip in the pool. I‚Äôm thinking that sounds perfect, right? Some of you may already know where this is going‚Ä¶. I get to his room and there is a towel on the bed. In my favorite color. With my fucking stupid-ass-spelled name embroidered into it. So here I am crying over a goddamn towel and he‚Äôs in the doorway watching and grinning like he just pranked me or some shit. Turns out it was HER idea but she checked with Mike to make sure it was spelled right. So now I have a towel for when we visit because APPARENTLY I‚Äôm welcome.

If I sound cranky it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm better at self-depreciation than I am expressing emotions in a direct way. I really am blown away and touched by how much these people have welcomed me. Mike has already sort of learned to decode the way I talk and joke, which is nice, but the first time he gently said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not humor, that‚Äôs just putting yourself down, babe,‚Äù I definitely wanted to go hide under the table. He doesn‚Äôt let me be mean to me. That‚Äôs a thing good partners do, I guess? I wouldn‚Äôt know. (Again, yes I am in therapy, I am working on myself, it‚Äôs not his responsibility to put me back together, it‚Äôs just something he does naturally.) I literally told him one night that I was sorry I‚Äôm kind of broken, and he snorted and said ‚Äúat least you can walk‚Äù in the most disgusted voice ever and made me laugh.

I digress. So the food was once again amazing, and I kept my promise to teach his mom how to make my cinnamon bun bread pudding, so I felt like I contributed. (Insert Ralph Wiggum ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Helping!‚Äù meme.) I learned to play Yahtzee, and as it turns out I am very good at it. They do a lot of board games things at night when everyone is staying for the week. These people have a LOT of board games. And puzzles. Whole damn storage closet of the things. They also drink like fuckin FISH and can hold it so I am learning to pace myself. Mike doesn‚Äôt drink much when we aren‚Äôt there so I‚Äôm not worried that it‚Äôs a red flag. Only red flag of his that I‚Äôve found was a Red Sox pennant in his room.

Now I realize I might be talking him up a lot, but he isn‚Äôt perfect! He snores, he has a habit of arguing with people on the TV when they make stupid decisions, he sometimes starts talking about things I don‚Äôt understand and just goes and goes until he realizes he lost me like 15 minutes ago, and he is FASTIDIOUSLY tidy, which makes me feel guilty because I have bad habits to lose. I‚Äôm not used to ‚Äúclutter means I can‚Äôt move through an area‚Äù but I‚Äôm really trying. I barely spend any time at my own place anymore, and we‚Äôre definitely looking to move in together sooner than later.

Yeah, so, not that much of an update, no one burned themselves on a firework or anything super exciting, I‚Äôm just in an ongoing relationship with a great guy who has a great family and things continue to look up for us. We head home tonight so we can spend some alone time Sunday. Hope everyone else had a safe and happy holiday!

**UPDATE: Dating a disabled guy yes it's me again - 4 weeks later**

I debated just posting this on my own page, but shit , like a lot of people keep asking for more so I guess it doesn‚Äôt hurt to drop my post between ‚ÄúAITAH for literally killing someone‚Äù and ‚ÄúAITAH for meekly accepting my inlaw‚Äôs cruelty but asking if I may wash my wounds before they flog me again.‚Äù

This is not an exciting update. Not engaged. No babies on the way, not even freakishly tall ones like some of you are hexing me with. But‚Ä¶. Jess finally met Mike.

TLDR: Learning to read long posts is good for your attention span.

SORRY! I mean I‚Äôm not sorry, I feel compelled to open with a joke and I don‚Äôt know why. Anyway real TLDR she thinks he‚Äôs amazing, she thinks it is HYSTERICAL that I‚Äôm on tictok (I refuse to download it) and she is doing amazing. And our lives are moving forward together.

Jess and I have this friend, who I will call Meg and NOT TALULAH despite both Jess and Mike thinking would be hilarious. Meg was planning to have a birthday party, the big THREE OH, and she and Jess are close (and both presently single.) They chose a local bar with outside seating, and Jess did a ‚Äúwait, lets check their accessibility‚Äù because I have been bitching to her for the last month. And lol and be-fucking-hold after calling the place, they didn‚Äôt have a ramp for the balcony/outside seating area.

As I have been told Jess said ‚Äúnope I am meeting Mr. Throwra\_JessComeOn‚Äù and so they found another place that‚Äôs a damn hike from everyone. But it has a great outside area with accessibility. And THEN we got the invite. Through Facebook because we are all basic, I guess? And Mike was stoked because they have this awesome beer selection (full stop I hate hops sooooo). Then Meg told us that (no I am not using Talulah for the 15% of you going ‚Äúoh but that was such a better name‚Äù) they chose it because Jess wanted Mike to feel welcome. So hats off to Jess for making the comeback impression of the century, I guess.

The birthday was fun, and silly, and everyone in my immediate friend group met Mike and loved him. Tons of laughter, everyone drank way too much, but fortunately we had enough heads up for a planned motel stay (why yes, I do own a UV flashlight, why do you ask?) so we and a bunch of other people didn‚Äôt drive home. We actually had brunch in the bar the next day, it was absolutely awesome and I am ruined for pancakes because FLUFFY.

Once again, I digress.

Jess and Mike hit it off and she told him literally every story I didn‚Äôt want her to over brunch, and it all was great apart from the persistent hangover. I crashed at Mike‚Äôs again. Annnnnnd then he asked what it would cost to break my lease, because he hates the mornings he wakes up and I‚Äôm not there. So the next upcoming week and a half or so is going to be insane while I pack up my whole damn life and shove half into a storage unit and the other half into his apartment, and then we‚Äôll be living together.

I know it‚Äôs too soon. He does too. We‚Äôve decided we‚Äôre idiots and just going for it. My landlord is a lady who is a bit on the older side and isn‚Äôt charging me for breaking the lease as long as I leave the place ready for a new renter, so I may respond to comments for a bit right away but expect a lot of silence for a while after.

True TLDR: Best friend made a good second impression, and I‚Äôm moving in with Mike ahead of schedule. I should be worried but I‚Äôm actually just really excited. Wish me luck!!

**UPDATE: Dating a disabled guy and this headline gets more and more awkward so probably ‚ÄúDating Mike with the Wheels‚Äù from now on - 7 weeks later**

Hey! I get a LOT of messages asking how things are going, but I kinda HATE when people update every five minutes with the ‚Äúmy neighbor looked at me sideways‚Äù updates after three paragraphs of recapping drama.

So for those not invested:

Still with Mike. He‚Äôs amazing. I will marry him.

We live together now! It‚Äôs been trying. As in he is trying not to laugh at how inept I am at cohabitation. I am really good at not leaving stuff out, now, so there‚Äôs improvement. He doesn‚Äôt infantilize (oOOooO reddit big brain word) me at all but he definitely gives me the grace due an absolute idiot. I appreciate it.

We are not engaged (guys it‚Äôs been half a year, come on.)

I‚Äôm writing a book about our relationship. It starts with ‚ÄúMy name is‚Äù and the rest is just notes. Don‚Äôt hold your breath.

Jess moved into my old apartment. Yes, my former landlord is the GOAT. Jess is also seeing a guy. I think it is too soon. She agrees. But she has ‚Äúreasons‚Äù (girl we all have needs) and who am I to judge.

Aaaaand I was recently in kind of a serious car accident. I am fine, I have great health insurance, great car insurance, and am recovering just fine. No go funds here, though if you want to help just find a reputable charity for helping victims of drunk drivers and give them your money. So I was on my way home from working overtime and some dude clipped my car and I ended up in a ditch while he just sort of spun out‚Ä¶.. but I wear my seatbelt because I have a brain and I got really, really lucky.

Everything is fine, my medical deductible was already paid up for the year, and the worst I had was some bruises, a cracked femur fibula, whiplash, and a totaled car. The silver lining is that Mike is GREAT at caretaking? Another check mark in the having kids category. Also his mom brought us like a million home made frozen dinners in Costco serving trays and we had nowhere to put them so she bought us a fucking chest freezer. I‚Ä¶.. guys I don‚Äôt even know with this family. They are amazing.

I know usually I give some sweet, heartwarming updates while bitching about mental health, but I am pretty well medicated until my leg heals and I have a few weeks off work to cuddle Mike while watching bad sci-fi, so I‚Äôm not in the best place to fill your cups. Sorry. Also don‚Äôt watch ‚ÄúAnother Life‚Äù on Netflix unless you have the ability to set your brain aside because it is the least consistent show I have ever seen. I mean I loved it especially the spine ripping itself out of a person and trying to walk away OH MY GOD but it requires suspension of disbelief like few things I have encountered in all my years.

Also Mike says hi. He indulges meeeee.

Have a good autumn and please for the love of heck don‚Äôt drive drunk.

And don‚Äôt expect anything from me unless the Thanksgiving gathering is as epic as they claim (ahahaha I almost slipped and said his last name. No doxxing for you today!) because reddit is probably already over my shit.

As always, love you guys for all the support, I‚Äôm okay, relationship is fab, and please don‚Äôt drink and drive.

Edit: I don't have a cracked femur. Jesus crackers these meds are something. I have a fractured fibula (lower leg, outside bone) and it didn't break all the way through. I have no idea how I mixed those two up. Mike says at least I'm cute when I'm high, but he is clearly biased. So yeah. Cracked fibula, little leg bone, short(ish) healing time. Not femur thank fuck.



**UPDATE: Dating Mike with the wheels, belated Thanksgiving and Christmas updates - 2.5 months later**

I had a Thanksgiving post in my notes almost fully written when unfortunately I got the call. I‚Äôve mentioned before that I had kind of a rough upbringing and have been estranged from my parents for a few years, but they were still my parents, you know? So anyhow my mother passed away the day after Thanksgiving. (Natural causes, she just neglected her health in general.) I hadn‚Äôt talked to her since a half hearted attempt last Christmas, she didn‚Äôt even know about Mike. And I don‚Äôt know if I even feel sad, exactly, but it knocked me for a loop and writing about how great Mike‚Äôs family is left a bad taste in my mouth. My therapist says I (paraphrasing here) already mourned the loss of the good parts of my mom when I started processing the bad parts, so my reaction isn‚Äôt abnormal. For once.

But it wasn‚Äôt the easiest time, and then the funeral meant a whole lot of people I never wanted to see again. Mike was a godsend, he‚Äôs so charismatic and charming that no one had anything bad to say to me, it was more like a room of acquaintances. I‚Äôm so glad we moved in together, I don‚Äôt know how I would have gotten through it and then gone home alone.

So‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm going to do this a little out of order. Mike and I spent the whole Christmas week with his parents again, and they were very sympathetic and understanding in the ‚Äúwe respect that you don‚Äôt want us to make a big deal‚Äù way. Most of his family wasn‚Äôt there except for dinner the day after Christmas (just wait till the Thanksgiving recap and you‚Äôll understand why Christmas is so low key, no one could handle that twice in two months.) So it was nice to wake up and feel like family and open presents in my pajamas. Mike and I have matching Christmas ones now. We are ridiculous together, and I love it. Also, it was a white Christmas for the first time in years!!

To those hoping for a proposal‚Ä¶.. I did get jewelry! But not a ring. Sorry! Believe me it‚Äôs on the table and where we feel we are headed, but we‚Äôre not rushing things. Also given everything going on, it wouldn‚Äôt have been the right time. But I got a lovely pendant with my birthstone and real diamonds, so I was very spoiled.

Christmas dinner was good and catered, and a lot of chaos and kids and presents, and I missed most of it because I had a pretty bad headache and it was just a LOT at once. But I was there for pictures, and everyone kind of accepts that I‚Äôm the future wife even without a ring, so I feel nice and included.

Sorry that this update is on a bit of a downer note, I know I don‚Äôt really sound like my usual upbeat self, but I‚Äôll get back there once the holidays, seasonal depression, and STUFF is behind me. That‚Äôs why I saved my Thanksgiving post for the end, to hopefully go out on a high note.

The Thanksgiving recap:

Hi all! I get a lot of requests for updates, so I thought I‚Äôd share how things are going, now that gluttony day is behind us. Mike and I are happily cohabitating still, things are well on most fronts. I had a minor car accident a little while ago (I posted on my page about it) but I‚Äôm mostly healed up now. Mike‚Äôs family is still the absolute best, and honestly his mom is more motherly than mine has ever been. Sucks, but it is what it is. (See? That line right there, ouch.)

I‚Äôd been warned that Thanksgiving is sort of their BIG holiday, since a lot of the family spends time elsewhere on Christmas. And that it‚Äôs a bit of a spectacle. But Lord Almighty I was not prepared for this shit. So, things you need to know: there is some weird ‚Äúbattle of the sexes‚Äù thing they do. A few years ago Mike‚Äôs mom pointed out that the family kept getting bigger and it was harder to make enough turkey for everyone. So the kids got together (and everyone takes credit for the idea) and bought their dad one of those turkey deep fryers for Christmas. So Thanksgiving rolls around again (I so wish I‚Äôd met Mike sooner to see it myself) and thanks to the combination of beer and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we can figure this out‚Äù ‚Ä¶.apparently their dad set fire to the lawn. At least no one was hurt, apart from pride. But after that there was sober practice, and now mom‚Äôs turkey vs dad‚Äôs turkey is this whole THING. Like there is literally shit talk the whole day. People are set up into camps.

I joked we needed team shirts and I think they actually want to do that next year.

It was all pretty hilarious and casual, and they had like three damn tables set up. Don‚Äôt worry, reddit! I made sure no teenagers were being parentified or unliked inlaws were being forced to sit at the kids table. (Actually I was low-key jealous, they got crayons and coloring books.) The food was all amazing and all hands on deck except for me because his mom refused to have me on my feet even though my leg is basically fine now. Mike kept bringing me stuff, it was so cute y‚Äôall. I can‚Äôt even put into words how much golden retriever energy this boy has.

If you‚Äôre wondering who made the better turkey? Ooh man it‚Äôs hard. Mike‚Äôs mom does a brine (Alton Brown is the GOAT) but there is something about fried turkey skin that is just next level. So I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a tie, and that‚Äôs not just me being diplomatic. I ate so much that I barely had room for dessert. It was fantastic. I never fall asleep in the car, but I was passed out on the drive home. We had kind of a second Thanksgiving at home the next day from the leftovers, and I probably just put on 50 pounds. No ragrets.

Anyway I‚Äôm off to sleep the bird off, I hope you all had a wonderful turkey day and a great Christmas coming up!


**New Update - 1 year Anniversary**

Hello once again, reddit friends! Sorry to anyone who saw my mini-update and felt cheated of the story. Things have been crazy busy since the start of the year.

TL/DR for those who say ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt reading all that‚Äù (like you have anything better to do on the shitter): Mike proposed!

I am officially slated to be Mrs. MikeWithTheWheels some time in the next year or so. I will absolutely give you the deets, BUT, first a little on why I haven‚Äôt updated or responded much lately. I absolutely love the comments, well wishes, and private messages telling me how much our story has moved them. I can‚Äôt believe how many strangers I feel so close to because you‚Äôve gone through similar tough or lonely childhoods, or have/had inlaws that aren‚Äôt amazing. I don‚Äôt usually respond (shockingly, this isn‚Äôt my regular reddit account) but I read them and appreciate you.

On the other side, I‚Äôve gotten some toxicity too, though fortunately not nearly as much as you might expect with the internet these days. A lot of people ask for pictures and stuff, and I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs not happening. I‚Äôve already given enough details and this has spread far enough that someone doxxed me (they were nice enough, and young, and didn‚Äôt realize just how absolutely weird and invasive that was) but it definitely made me step back a little. I don‚Äôt mind sharing updates into our life when there‚Äôs something to talk about, but I‚Äôm still a real person with a real life and I don‚Äôt want to be some kind of influencer or whatever. You also won‚Äôt see any kind of go fund me or panhandling, I‚Äôm not broke, student loans are being paid down, and Mike is rocking his career too. We have enough to be comfortable. If you want to contribute in some positive way to our lives, I recommend making a donation to the Wheelchair Foundation, they do great work and not every family is like Mike‚Äôs and could afford a good chair when he was a kid.

And please don‚Äôt dox me, it‚Äôs already weird enough having Jess laughing at me while playing a Tik Tok of someone reading my writing.

So, back to the mushy crap.

Mike and I have been pretty upfront about the idea that we both want marriage and think this is the real deal, but aside from that, there wasn‚Äôt a timeline. Our anniversary was on a different day of the week, and we did take out, but the next Saturday he suggested we go to the same bar we met at and recreate our first date. I thought it was the cutest idea for a date night (yes, I am an idiot.) He brought a book and everything! So, things are stupidly cute, and I‚Äôm feeling silly and giddy. And then he tells me about this book he‚Äôs reading, would I like to see? And I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù The cover wasn‚Äôt important. What WAS? This boy ordered some Etsy made hollow book. And there it is, THE RING and ‚ÄúWill you marry me‚Äù on the inside cover.

Y‚Äôall the way I went from bubbly to SOBBING. I had no idea it would hit me like that, I guess even with talking about it somehow I just didn‚Äôt expect it? He came over and called me sappy and I babbled something about ‚ÄúYES OBVIOUSLY‚Äù and so now there‚Äôs a ring on my left hand. We don‚Äôt have a date set, but I‚Äôm thinking something in the fall, probably. Your girl here gonna get a white dress and everything.

If you‚Äôre wondering, (remember back when this was about her?) Jess SCREAMED when I told her and asked if she can wear a suit and give me away and while hilarious, probably not. It would be funny though. She‚Äôs doing good though (living at my old place actually) and staying single while she gets her head back in the best shape possible.

So yeah, there it is, he asked, I said yes, and I will be Mrs. Wheels some time in the next year or so! Thanks for all the well wishes and support and love, you have all made my lonely little world brighter the same way Mike has.

He recently contacted me. I try to keep my distance but we talked quite abit .laughing etc. I have a feeling he is a mixed up guy. I ended up getting hurt because I believe him. I knew his situation but my feelings got the best of me. I told him I wasn't happy with him. And he said he didn't to cause me to be upset.i told I am done with this.  Long story.. I ran into on the street and we talk and we made peace . He ask me for a kiss . I did kiss and hugged him  and I said we can meet for  a cup of coffee now and then..keeping it as friends. Well after awhile he reached out we talked and he began getting close again. Where I told enough!!!! I ask him what do you want.? He said not specifically what he wanted ? He said we can talk in-person sometime? Honestly it took alot of strength to stay away from him.. then a mutual contact me she is not a good friend. Saying me and the guy should talk as he really wants to talk to me but prefers that I reach out?? Insane I think the guy ask to to nudge me? What's terrible about this story is how this woman would be involved with this.  She called me a few times but I rarely answered.  And I told her I don't want to be involved in this.  And she basically told me her hubby was talking to David the guy . So when I asked her if both guys were still. She said they haven't in awhile??? Very fuc%@$ up.. she playing with my head .. obviously it's was her talking to David.. I spoke to my exhubby about this situation as we are good friends now and he said they have lost their marbles.  How can people can pain like this? The guy never harassed me but he must have realized it was difficult on me  what I remember about this man is he was a better person at one time . This just breaks my heart. I am trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. I know he would change the subject when I was uncomfortable and he had manners but  I have been so disappointed in this  person  we were friends at one time .. as for the woman she has mental illness because this is cruelness  üíî ,1,1744998652.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

Firstly I don't know much about the culture of this board but I give the majority of the credit to Kseniya International and her youtube videos....I just finished buying her a couple of cups of coffee! This is a process that I obviously started before the 88 days watching videos on how to fill out the forms and how to best prepare them...what took me the longest was realizing I needed or it was best to submit the i-693 medical (which required my wife to go get new vaccines) with our documents..that set us back some time. 

my wife is from Venezuela she is here under TPS status and had a work authorization approved...after I watched and gathered information from here and from Kseniya's video's I made her a hubby/wife bet that I can have her case approved in 3 months time. I said how much do you want to bet? she did not bet me because she saw the conviction in my eyes and heart. (btw our bets are who gets to pick the restaurant we go to celebrate...mainly bragging rights) :) 

We interviewed on Tuesday in the Miami office (did not get the instant approval) actually missed a document in person that I submitted online. I had told my wife, beforehand, we are going to get one of those officers that is going to see how real our relationship is and approve us after the first question.  That was not the case...we did get about 10 questions or so and then the standard legalese of have you ever been in the mafia or done illegal activities etc etc...

but i feel the fact that we missed that document made it so he could not approve us on the spot we left a bit bummed because we were like how is it possible we did not bring this document or misplaced it?  I explained to the official that it should definitely be online, but that was towards the end of the interview and it felt like just with us not having the document the interview was over..we were given a document that we would be notified of next step in the mail. I asked him again, so a decision can't be made today? He said no, I have to review her file and then you will be notified in the mail.

  
I told my wife, I said babe"" one of two things will happen, he will either review the document online and see we did submit it and approve us"" or worst case as it said on the document we might get called back for a second interview and have to bring the document then. I was bummed because I worked so hard to have everything in order, double and triple checking everything. I was bummed I was not going to fulfill my 3 month process but today we were approved...I know my story is hot garbage but its an emotional write..feel free to ask questions I will try to answer all as best as I can.

For most people i guess things might be different but i guess its not the case for me like no one wants to talk to new people or something. No one is friendly with you , but the sheer coldness nowadays makes you not go to college. Its makes you just stay in your flat or go somewhere else but thats the end.

I mean i am friends with few guys and they are every good but seeing all these groups and you standing there with one guy does make you think , what wrong you are doing in your ways of life. I was encouraged by my friend to talk to girls but its like even asking them out or simply introducing yourself or greeting them , they take an offence to them like maybe you harrassed them tho i understand how delhi and general male public is but that how the hell are everyone in a relationship if thats case but than i don't know i might just look like shrek to get that.

Still it is had to feel good coming to college and find genuine people and not hanhing out in a cringe group , like just few years back my cousin was in du too and when i met his group or people in the college , most sounded much wiser than whatever is happening today. You just end up having headphone in the free time listening to music cause thats all you can do. It also takes a toll in your studies , you just can't study or do anything. Nowadays i just try to make myself busy in things to make myself busy , i go to gym or take 2 hour long walking sessions to calm in down. or getting yourself drunk on a saturday night to deal with the raging loneliness cause you can't do shit bout it. 

I mean , i'll choose being alone than hang out with wrong people but its just too much sometimes and nothing works and i went to become i guy who does everything by himself cause free times is like a continuous tourture in the pit of misery. i think most people go through this but no one talks bout it. you live in a denial of your time and space. Walking long night , going to places but just walking and walking alone. Smoke a cig or drink a coffee in a cafe or travel in metro and all you see is happy couple and friends. End is maybe things might change or it will not , try to atleast do what you wanna for your dreams atleast.

I don't drown in drugs , don't chase the wrong person or just become a lifeless person, keep things to engage yourself maybe go to a gym , cook your own food , study for your dreams , go for a movie , go for a walk or just go roaming places around the city and maybe you'll see people less fortunate and you'll think maybe i am not really in the worst place or you'll just get tired and will not have energy to think bout it.",5,1744998021.0,delhiuniversity,4,1.0,False

Now this round Tsu won I feel because he was hitting Geechi with bars specifically catered towards him and they hit as well. He mixed in coffee bars and some general bars but overall I felt his personals were better this round than Geechis not by a big margin but enough to give it to Tsu. 

Round 3: Geechi
Last round ended stronger than tsu‚Äôs tbh. Also I felt that both of their thirds were mainly general bars but geechis hit harder so it‚Äôs easier to score both rounds cause they were fairly similar. Also tsu‚Äôs third wasn‚Äôt long at all it seemed short and like he was runnin out of gas.

Daiomi placed a hand to her bosom and thanked her unlucky stars. Little Mary was sitting at the last table with Ralphie. She was playing and coloring in her new activity book about all the sucky goody-goody angels, like a proper vampire child. Daiomi‚Äôs eyes rolled around in her head from the exhaustion of it all. Focusing her attention back on you, she said, ‚ÄúForgive me, Reader. I seemed to have had a brief conniption there. Do you have any vamplings of your own? I must say. They make life very exciting,‚Äù she uttered, along with an exasperated laugh to match, before serving you a small portion of everything. ‚ÄúFeel free to come back. Devil knows there‚Äôs plenty to be had.‚Äù

The side dishes she served you were right next to the entrees, keeping warm at the steam table, inside of six-inch-deep half pans. The first was chopped sweet potatoes, glazed in brown sugar and maple syrup. Next you had chopped roasted potatoes, and last was fluffy yellow jasmine rice. As far as veggies went, let‚Äôs see, there was asparagus and two vegetable medleys that utilized the fresh vegetables in Ralphie‚Äôs garden. One was served without seasoning, and the other was stir fried in soy sauce. Next you had green beans that were fried and seasoned with fresh garlic, and lastly, sun dried tomatoes brushed in olive oil and topped with fresh oregano.

After receiving your plate, which was now pretty heavy, you listened to one last thank you for being a part of the story from Daiomi before you and Nano made your way to the next food station. Nero‚Äôs angry voice caught your ears. He was yelling at Lenda, telling her to hurry up, and to stop piling a bunch of sweets on her plate. She flicked him off without realizing you were there. When she looked over and saw you, she let out an apology for her vulgarity before rushing to catch up with her squaddie. Nano‚Äôs voice came out of nowhere, causing you to turn around to see what he wanted. Because whenever he spoke, it was always a bit unsettling.

‚ÄúI can hold your plate of nutrients for you,‚Äù he said robotically.

You gave it to him for safekeeping... I mean it made sense. That way you could focus on filling up another one with items from these interesting new second and third stations. A small fruit and salad bar came next. Meh. Whatever. What was at the third station was way cooler. You know. The one that made Nero so angry and Lenda oh so happy. Hah! Sweets of course! Jams, blood syrups, a pan of fried dough (churros), zucchini bread, and dinner rolls. Inside the display stand were individual pastries: Danishes, cookies, donuts, mince pies, stuff like that.

When Lenda got to the mini station, after loading up on sweets at the previous one, she made what could only be described as a syrupy sugary slurpy monstrosity! What did she do? Well. She combined coffee, lemonade, fruit punch, and tea into a single cup and then poured enough milk, honey, sugar, and blood syrup into it to make a barista blush. Her grin couldn‚Äôt have been any bigger. She was like a kid set free in a candy shop; singing one of her favorite tunes about sexy murder-bots while merrily catching up to Nero and waiting for him to finish preparing his own monstrosity. The ringing in her singing turned into a sharp note. Because whatever stinky nastiness he was pouring all over his food mountain made her shriek.

‚ÄúHell yeah! I can‚Äôt believe my luck!‚Äù Nero exclaimed.

‚ÄúUgh! W-what is that?‚Äù Lenda asked.

‚ÄúGarum. I love this stuff!!‚Äù

‚ÄúYuck! It stinks!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have to try it‚Äîit‚Äôs the best!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo way! It smells like dead fish.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because it is,‚Äù he grinned.

‚ÄúGross!‚Äù she said while retching.

‚ÄúHey! Wait up!‚Äù Nero said before quickly dabbing Winchester sauce on his food and then chasing after her. He masterfully balanced his food mountain, somehow preventing it from tipping over several times, as the two made their way to a table that sat four.

You went over to the beverage and condiment station and grabbed everything you needed to enjoy your meal and then went to join them. On your way you saw quite a few vampires you had never met but remembered from the crowd that had gathered to watch Nero when he was performing his sick warm up earlier today. The giggling girls giggled; they were sitting behind you. Scarlet and Dacia stared; they were sitting at the table across from you.

Lenda waved at Dacia, which caused her to make her patented ‚Äúangry‚Äù face, which was a cute huff that always ended in a ‚Äúhumph.‚Äù She was still insulted by her waver‚Äôs behavior early today when she *borrowed* her things without permission. Lenda also waved at Scarlet, which didn‚Äôt go over too well. She glared at her for a second and then returned to painstakingly picking at her plate as if food was the worst thing on this crappy world we all lived in and would *never* turn into a better place. To say that she was as bleak as she was dark would be a sobering understatement. Her eyes alone held a misery that was as rich as the soil along the Nile River. You saw others like Ralphie, and Little Mary, sitting next to a dark priest wearing a black cassock at the very last table.

Lenda smiled when you sat down, as if she was super happy to see you. Nero didn‚Äôt even so much as look up at you. Food was the only thing super to him at this moment, and he ate like he meant it, like an army recruit at boot camp, who had until the other table sat down to finish. Nano sat down next to you. The other two were on the other side of the table. The four of you were sitting at one of several tables that conveniently sat four, right in the middle of the hall, almost right above the multi-tiered chandelier. There was an elongated table that sat God knows how many to the left, separated from the family tables by a carpeted aisle. The long table stretched from one end of the hall to the other. There weren‚Äôt a lot of people sitting over there, about six in total, laughing and talking while passing around a basket of bread. The only person you recognized over there was Hester the overseer. His rotund stomach and jolly good laughter were hard to forget. Not only that, but he was the only human you had met thus far into the story.

Nero‚Äôs plate was packed messily with meat and vegetables that sat atop a mountain of potatoes. It would have been a shocking display of gluttony, but something told you he probably needed the calories to support his freakish frame. Lenda‚Äôs plate was the complete opposite. There wasn‚Äôt a healthy thing in sight. Every sugary snack they had to offer seemed to be neatly arranged on her plate. The sight was unsettling to say the least. Oh and Nano, he just sat there staring at his empty plate, occasionally studying his squad mates whenever they interacted.¬†

Lenda watched you while biting into a glazed donut. Then she answered her own question, ‚ÄúWhy a little bit of everything? Aah, I get it now... That‚Äôs such a smart work around for‚Äîyou know... what do you call it again? Tch-ha‚Äîthe whole not being able to talk thingy.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that smart,‚Äù Nero told her.

‚ÄúGross. Don‚Äôt talk with your mouth full,‚Äù Lenda said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm an adult. I can do what I want,‚Äù Nero replied.

‚ÄúPah! I‚Äôll be one of those pretty soon‚Äîso shove it!‚Äù And when I am, the first thing I‚Äôm going to do is get as far away from you as possible!‚Äù she claimed.

‚ÄúHah, hah, very funny. I don‚Äôt think the world will even be around by then,‚Äù he said before staring at you and adding, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll destroy it by then.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my. What‚Äôs wrong with her?‚Äù Lenda asked.

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù Nero asked while looking over there.

‚ÄúNo! What‚Äôre‚Äîdon‚Äôt make it so obvious!‚Äù Lenda spewed out. ‚ÄúOh my badness. What‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù she asked after burying her face in her hands.

‚ÄúOh. That‚Äôs Scarlet. She‚Äôs insane,‚Äù Nero said.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not insane. That‚Äôs so mean. Stop staring!‚Äù

‚ÄúHow would you know? You never met her.‚Äù

‚ÄúUm. Does see usually stare daggers?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so. Yeah. She hates everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcept for Dacia,‚Äù she smiled, noticing the two were sitting at the same table. It was an odd sight. Seeing two oddballs, who were on both ends of the spectrum, find what looked like friendship in each other‚Äôs company. It would have been cute if they were a couple Lenda thought, but then she thought about how funny it was that she had other admirers now like Nero.

‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù Nero said, practically reading her mind.

‚ÄúOh. Look. She‚Äôs waving at you,‚Äù Lenda said.

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù Nero asked while turning bright.

‚ÄúYour one and only love,‚Äù Lenda snickered.

‚ÄúDamn. Are you sure it‚Äôs her?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Äîlook over there silly!‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did I not notice her?! Tch. I can‚Äôt believe this,‚Äù Nero said as he took a breath. Just when he was starting to enjoy his food, he had to finish with a disturbed mind. Pigging out was like the one thing he enjoyed besides training to be the best. He tried to shove the thought of her out his head, but the numbness that came over him shoved even harder.

‚ÄúWave at her... jerk!‚Äù Lenda said.

‚ÄúI-I can‚Äôt move my arm.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying,‚Äù* he swore through clenched teeth.

‚ÄúRidiculous,‚Äù Lenda said before grabbing his limp arm and waving it for him. When she did this, he asked what her response was and she said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs laughing at you.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Nero sighed in turmoil, wanting nothing more than to lather his face in hot honey and then shove it into a fluffy mound full of fire ants. Since there obviously wasn‚Äôt any around, he hunched his shoulders and quietly resigned himself to his food like a POW.

‚ÄúOh, hi!‚Äù Lenda said, waving at the giggling girls.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù Nero asked without looking back in fear that he might somehow cross eyes with Dacia, which was ridiculous, considering she was on the other side.

‚ÄúHannah and Drusilla,‚Äù Lenda told him.

‚ÄúOh okay...‚Äù

‚ÄúWe met while I was giving the Reader a tour of the first floor.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh great...‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. They‚Äôre always giggling. I hate them.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh damn‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou lost your mojo or something?‚Äù Lenda asked.

‚ÄúOh yeah‚Ä¶ n-no! What‚Äôre you talking about?*‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDang*. Dacia really did a number on you,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúShut up before she hears you!‚Äù he whispered angrily.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so hopeless,‚Äù she whispered back teasingly.

Lenda laughed hysterically while watching him whistle in anger like a demonic teakettle that had been brewed by a wicked warlock. Her laughter only stopped when she just so happened to look over at her other squad mate. He was just sitting there staring at his plate. It was both the oddest thing and the saddest thing. The only one more hopeless than Nero was Nano. Why if it wasn‚Äôt for the sweetness of her mince pie, she would have probably fallen into her own hopeless spiral. ‚ÄúSo. How‚Äôs your food?‚Äù she asked, knowing full well it was a loaded question.

‚ÄúCan you rephase your inquiry,‚Äù Nano stated.

‚ÄúIs it yummy?‚Äù she asked, smiling.

‚ÄúI do not require sustenance.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah but you have to at least wonder, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Gustation is a very easy biologically function to simulate if so desired. I will not downgrade my programming unless ordered to do so by the leader caste.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by downgrade?‚Äù Nero asked.

‚ÄúIngestion is an obsolete function primarily utilized by our lesser Sapient AI brethren.‚Äù

‚ÄúOoh. Who are they?‚Äù Lenda asked.

‚ÄúI will give a comparison. Sapient AI are drones whose roles are similar to the servants who are retained by the oligarchic members of your species. Sapient AI are conscious but have a limited awareness of four-dimensional transitional space. They perform all day-to-day processes and mundane post quantum computations required to maintain what you would call hardware. This development allows our city to function at maximum efficiency.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait. You guys have a city?‚Äù Lenda asked.

‚ÄúYes. Where else would we reside?‚Äù

‚ÄúWow. What‚Äôs the name?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúSimulation: 1E12: Iteration: 009.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh. That‚Äôs not a very good name.‚Äù Lenda thought about her question and rephased it. ‚ÄúHmm. What do vampires like my dad call your city whenever you guys communicate? I‚Äôve heard him mention it before... I just can‚Äôt remember what he said.‚Äù

‚ÄúBiologicals refer to our city as: Alpha Omega.‚Äù

\---

Sensei suddenly appeared with your portion of blood beef. After setting the bloody saucer on the table, he said sinisterly, *‚ÄúFor you‚Ä¶‚Äù* While watching your reaction... how you studied the oddity before you, he added, ‚ÄúThe chef will understand if you don‚Äôt eat it.‚Äù

Then after sliding you your portion, he looked around at everyone else‚Äôs plate and simply shook his head at the absurdity. He also found it amusing how uncomfortable his presence had made Nero. And with that he said, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs everyone doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre great!‚Äù Lenda claimed.

‚ÄúExcellent,‚Äù he muttered, but before walking away, he added, ‚ÄúKeep at it and you‚Äôll be a team worthy of the ‚Äòangel hunter‚Äô moniker in no time.‚Äù

You and Lenda watched in disbelief as Sensi sat down at the table with Scarlet and Dacia. He began chatting with them. Scarlet nodded her head and even looked engaged. It was a shock that made sense, the longer you thought about it, since they both had dark souls. Huh. No one else seemed to find their interaction odd. Everyone else pretty much ignored them as if it were an everyday occurrence. Nano glanced over there but failed to understand the significance. Nero was too petrified to sneak a peek in fear that he might cross eyes with his crush. Luckily Lenda was there to say what everyone at the table wasn‚Äôt thinking. *After* she took a chunk out of her cookie and washed it down with a sip of her soupy concoction.

‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs very surprising! Who would‚Äôve known they were friends. You know what? I‚Äôm going to go over there and do a little investigating. But first, I just need to finish up some more of these sweets‚Äîhelps keep my energy up. Heh-heh, yeah,‚Äù she said with a sneaky smile. ¬†¬†

### What Are Adaptogens and Why Use Them?

Adaptogens are natural substances, typically herbs or roots, that help your body manage stress. Unlike stimulants or sedatives, adaptogens balance your system by supporting your body's natural ability to handle anxiety, fatigue, and environmental changes. People use adaptogens to improve energy, boost immunity, and enhance mental clarity.

Adding adaptogens to your daily life can be a simple, effective way to promote overall wellness. By doing so, you support your body's resilience, which can lead to better health in the long run.

### Choosing the Right Adaptogens for Your Needs

Before you start incorporating adaptogens, it‚Äôs important to pick the ones that suit your goals. Here are some popular adaptogens and what they‚Äôre commonly used for:

- **Ashwagandha:** Helps reduce stress, improve sleep, and boost energy.
- **Rhodiola Rosea:** Supports mental performance, fights fatigue, and improves endurance.
- **Holy Basil (Tulsi):** Known for its calming properties and immune-boosting benefits.
- **Eleuthero (Siberian Ginseng):** Enhances stamina and helps the body resist physical and mental stress.
- **Schisandra:** Promotes liver health and overall vitality.

Knowing the specific effects can help you pick adaptogens that fit your lifestyle. For example, if you‚Äôre looking for stress relief and better sleep, ashwagandha is an excellent choice. For more energy during the day, rhodiola rosea might be a better option.

### Simple Ways to Add Adaptogens Into Your Daily Routine

You don‚Äôt need a complicated ritual to enjoy the benefits of adaptogens. Here are easy methods to incorporate them into your day:

#### 1. Start Your Morning with an Adaptogen Drink

Add powdered adaptogens like ashwagandha or rhodiola into your morning coffee, tea, or smoothie. This is a great way to get a gentle energy boost without the crash from caffeine alone. Many adaptogens have a slightly earthy taste but mix well with flavored drinks.

#### 2. Use Adaptogen Teas Throughout the Day

Tea blends containing holy basil, eleuthero, or schisandra make refreshing, stress-relieving beverages. You can sip these teas mid-morning or in the afternoon to maintain calm and focus. Many brands offer blends specifically designed for relaxation or energy.

#### 3. Incorporate Adaptogen Supplements

Capsules or tinctures offer a convenient way to consume adaptogens if you‚Äôre short on time. Follow the instructions on the label, as dosages can vary. You can take them with meals or water to help reduce stress and slow fatigue on busy days.

#### 4. Add Adaptogens to Your Meals

Some adaptogens come in powder form and can be stirred into oatmeal, yogurt, or salad dressings. This integration allows you to compose meals packed with health benefits without noticing a big change in flavor. Experiment with small amounts first to find what suits your palate.

### Tips for Maximizing the Benefits of Adaptogens

To get the most out of adaptogens, keep these tips in mind:

- **Consistency is Key:** Adaptogens work best when used regularly. Try to include them in your routine daily or at least several times a week.
- **Start Slowly:** Begin with smaller doses to see how your body reacts. Increase gradually as needed.
- **Consult a Healthcare Provider:** If you‚Äôre pregnant, nursing, or have underlying health conditions, talk to your doctor before adding adaptogens to your regimen.

- **Observe Your Body:** Keep a journal of how you feel after using adaptogens. This will help you understand which ones benefit you most.

### Common Myths About Adaptogens

There are some misconceptions that might confuse beginners:

- **Adaptogens are instant fixes:** Unlike medications, adaptogens support your body's systems gradually over time.
- **One adaptogen fits all:** Different adaptogens serve different purposes. Personalizing your intake is important.
- **You can take unlimited amounts:** While natural, adaptogens require proper dosing. Taking too much could cause side effects.

Knowing these facts ensures you approach adaptogens with realistic expectations and smart habits.

### Listening to Your Body and Adjusting

When adding adaptogens into your daily life, listen closely to how your body responds. Some days you might need a stronger boost to combat stress, while other days a small amount may be enough. Adjust your intake based on your energy levels, mood, and overall wellbeing.

By making adaptogens part of your self-care routine, you build a stronger foundation for better health. Over time, you‚Äôll likely notice improvements in how you handle stress, sleep quality, and your vitality.

### Popular Adaptogens and Their Health Benefits

#### Ashwagandha

Ashwagandha is one of the most widely researched adaptogens. It‚Äôs renowned for its ability to reduce stress and anxiety by lowering cortisol levels, the body‚Äôs stress hormone. People also use it to boost energy, support immune health, and improve sleep quality.

- **Best use:** Take 300-500 mg of standardized extract twice daily or mix ashwagandha powder into smoothies or teas for an easy addition to your routine.
- **Note:** Consult a healthcare provider if you are pregnant or have thyroid issues, as ashwagandha can influence thyroid activity.

#### Rhodiola Rosea

Rhodiola helps fight fatigue and improve mental performance, making it a favorite adaptogen for students and busy professionals. It supports your body‚Äôs endurance during physical or mental stress without causing jitteriness.

- **Best use:** 100-200 mg daily in the morning is ideal. Avoid taking it too late in the day as it can be stimulating and affect sleep.
- **Tip:** Rhodiola supplements on an empty stomach tend to be absorbed better for quicker effects.

#### Holy Basil (Tulsi)

Holy basil is famous not just for its adaptogenic benefits but also for its anti-inflammatory properties. It calms the mind, supports immune function, and balances blood sugar levels.

- **How to consume:** Enjoy holy basil as a tea several times a day or use supplements standardized to contain active compounds like eugenol.
- **Why it works:** Its antioxidant properties help reduce the damage caused by chronic stress and inflammation.

#### Schisandra Berry

Schisandra is gaining traction for improving liver function and boosting energy. It enhances concentration and protects your body from oxidative stress.

‚Äã -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ‚Äã  
  
- **Usage advice:** Take 500 mg of Schisandra extract daily, or sip on traditional Schisandra tea to reap its benefits.
- **Special note:** This adaptogen is often used in combination with others for synergistic effects.

### How to Maximize the Benefits of Adaptogens

Different adaptogens work in unique ways, so integrating them into your lifestyle thoughtfully is crucial. Here are some best practices to help you get the most from these natural wonders:

- **Start slow:** Begin with low doses to see how your body responds, especially if you are sensitive to herbs.
- **Timing matters:** Some adaptogens like rhodiola work best in the morning for energy, while ashwagandha can be taken at night for better sleep.
- **Use them consistently:** Adaptogens typically show their full effects after several weeks of regular use. Patience is key.
- **Combine wisely:** You can mix adaptogens that have complementary effects, but research or consult a professional to avoid unwanted interactions.
- **Quality matters:** Choose high-quality, standardized extracts from reputable brands to ensure potency and safety.

### Methods to Include Adaptogens in Your Daily Routine

There are several simple ways to add adaptogens to your everyday life without disrupting your normal habits:

#### Adaptogen Teas and Infusions

Many adaptogens like holy basil and schisandra lend themselves well to brewing as herbal teas. You can steep dried herbs or pre-packaged tea bags steeped in hot water for about 5 to 10 minutes. Drinking 1-3 cups daily boosts hydration and provides steady adaptogenic effects.

#### Powders in Smoothies or Meals

Adaptogen powders such as ashwagandha or maca can be mixed into morning smoothies, oatmeal, or yogurt. This method is particularly convenient for those with busy mornings who want to incorporate health benefits effortlessly.

#### Capsules and Tinctures for Convenience

For precise dosing and ease of use, capsules and tinctures are excellent choices. They are portable and usually curated with standardized doses, making it easier to track your intake.

### Safety Considerations When Using Adaptogens

While adaptogens are generally safe for most people, it‚Äôs essential to keep a few points in mind:

- **Talk to your healthcare provider:** Especially if you are pregnant, nursing, have chronic illnesses, or take medications.
- **Watch for allergic reactions:** Stop use if you experience adverse symptoms like rash or digestive discomfort.
- **Use as a complement:** Adaptogens should support, not replace, a balanced diet, exercise, and healthy sleep habits.

By exploring these top adaptogens and integrating them thoughtfully into your daily routine, you can harness powerful natural tools to manage stress, boost vitality, and improve your overall wellbeing.

### Conclusion

Adaptogens into your daily routine offers a natural and effective way to boost your overall health and resilience.

Remember, consistency is key when working with adaptogens. Regular use allows your body to gradually adjust and experience their full health benefits. It‚Äôs also important to start with small doses and observe how your body responds, as individual needs may vary. Consulting with a healthcare provider can ensure you select the right adaptogens and avoid any potential interactions with medications.

But I feel like everytime I hear someone talk about Adderal It‚Äôs about substance abuse problems. 

And I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just a little scared about that. 

I guess my question is : is that really a problem I should be worried about, or do I just have anxiety?

It says 60% or more of Coachella attendees use payment plans for a ticket that is merely $600-$800. It's also common for concert goers to have multiple debts for multiple concerts at once.

What does this have to do with natalism ? Well, we keep hearing that young people don't have kids because of the economy. But the issue with this argument is it assumes the following :

>Young people are perfect with their finances, saving maximal amounts toward the future, and never over spending

Which I do not believe is true. We see evidence of the opposite happening. Young people are getting into debt and spending on things they can't afford. There is an addiction to experiences, and expensive ones at that. There's an addiction to instant gratification. 

When we tell young people to make coffee at home instead of buying it outside, they don't listen.

When we tell young people to put 600-800 in an index fund or high yield savings account, they don't listen.

The point here is, young people are of the mindset that they want everything now, without any sacrifices . This mindset can never lead you to investing in a relationship and a family . It is a very destructive cultural issue.

Eight years 

You just throw things at people‚Äôs faces ‚Äì my wife said once ‚Äì oversharing. And you expect to be forgiven. There‚Äôs something shameless about it, unattractive. It‚Äôs like you are asking them to accept you despite what you do.

I was putting kids to sleep the other night and my toddler daughter, while laying on me, she said ‚ÄòToday I was shouting. I am sorry. And I wasn‚Äôt listening and I sit on the sofa and I don‚Äôt want to eat. I love you, tata‚Äô. So I have said ‚ÄòI love you too‚Äô. And she laughed and closed her eyes. And honestly, my heart melted. I have such a hard time with her lately, she‚Äôs throwing tantrums, trying my limits, and sometimes I think, and I know I really shouldn‚Äôt, that she has some control of her feelings, and that she chooses to do things she did during the day, but toddlers actually don‚Äôt, they just fly around all they cause they are still stupid, like flies. She‚Äôs not the fiery, fierce, naughty villain, she can‚Äôt deal with emotions yet and she‚Äôs scared and sometimes she wants to do something else than what she is doing, but she is paralyzed. She is just a small child. So, what she said was basically ‚ÄòI love you, please love me back despite all this‚Äô.

And then I went downstairs, and I took quetiapine, just one pill, because I had intrusive thoughts, because my wife was sleeping at her lover‚Äôs place that night. She told me she would do so two days before. She said I really want it and I‚Äôm choosing it, and I don‚Äôt want you to say ‚Äòno‚Äô and I‚Äôm not really asking you, just checking if you are ok. And I said ‚ÄòOf course, that‚Äôs great, have fun‚Äô. And I meant it. I love seeing her enjoying life and trying new things and exploring sides of her personality she wouldn‚Äôt want to explore with me. I love that spark in her eyes when she‚Äôs happy. Why can‚Äôt we be like other people, she says, enjoy pottery or hiking, why is it sex and obsessing about someone.

So she was there overnight and I was really scared that I‚Äôm going to lose her, although for eight years she did nothing that would make me doubt her, for eight years she picked me up and she gave me two kids and she was with me and I was with her, and we always chose to talk, so I guess it‚Äôs just the pills causing paranoia. Cause I‚Äôm taking them again, because I felt it for the first time in eight years. And I‚Äôm struggling. And on the last summer I have cheated on her. I have hurt her badly. 

That other woman has approached me, and she was my childhood friend I haven‚Äôt seen in eight years, and she said come for a coffee after all this, and we have talked. And I‚Äôm on pills, I have said, because I can‚Äôt contain it anymore, the mess in my head makes me think stupidly and the paranoia and I should not be like this, and she said ‚Äòits fine. That‚Äôs how I remember you. You were always like this.‚Äô. That is what she was saying, but I have heard ‚ÄòI love you despite all this‚Äô, and I melted, like some stupid fly in a flame, and we had sex, but I did not enjoy it because all I really wanted is to hear these words from my wife, and I hadn‚Äôt, but not because she wasn‚Äôt saying that, just because I was deaf. 

And that other woman approached me on his funeral. Funeral of Hubert. He gets to bear a name because he was there when all that was happening, and for a long time only he knew about it, and he kept up with it, and we chose to never spoke about it but I knew he understood because I understood him so well, when his father threw him across the courtyard and into a metal gate and when he kicked him, and Hubert did nothing, because he was 18 years old, 6 foot tall, beautifully built, but he was just a small child, and he was so scared and he was paralysed and he just couldn‚Äôt react. And we have rarely spoke in the last eight years, our lives were so different, he has abandoned his son, while I was keen on the family life, and I couldn‚Äôt love him anymore despite all this, and we grew apart.

And I know I was not important to him anymore and I did not caused any of it, but I understood him so well when I heard that he drowned, that very summer, while swimming along some Danish beach, and that he was really drunk, I understood cause we grew up in a little village just by the sea, and he knew damn well how to swim and not to drink while at it, so he, and I understand that - Hubert chose to drown. 

I have said to my wife you should, go for it, when she said that she had met a man and she would love the idea but she would never chose it over our marriage, so she‚Äôs asking first, and I have said life is so complicated sometimes, I don‚Äôt mind the escapism, I don‚Äôt mind the obsession if its short lived, just like a flame, I don‚Äôt mind the sex ‚Äì hell, I am bisexual so I would love to join actually, but it is her experience and I should not hijack it, so I never told her about my insecurity, I never knew about it, but it kicked me that night, that she would take him to her favourite museum, and shared her favourite music with him, and other things that only I get to know about and only I can keep up with, but I said its fine and the idea of you being in control of all this Is great, cause I love to see you strong, I said I love you despite all this.

But that night I took the pills, because I was taking them for months now, because it all came back, after eight years, so I often stood on the platform and I looked and I assessed and I understood that I don‚Äôt have to, in that moment I can chose not to, and the fast moving train who could hit me, and I would just stay down there, and if I‚Äôm going to go back up there and face it - it‚Äôs just because I choose so. 

And I don‚Äôt hate myself for it. I have hated myself for many things. I was scared and I was often paralyzed when I was a small child, and not a 6 foot tall and properly built man, I have said to my father please come to me cause I cannot sleep, and he didn‚Äôt wanted too, and he was still mad at me for what happened during the day, for what I did, but I kept asking, although I already hated him, I was drawn to him like some stupid fly, I guess I wanted to say ‚Äòplease love me despite all this‚Äô, but I couldn‚Äôt phrase it until I was 30, and he came reluctantly and lied down in my bed without saying anything, and for half of the night I swear I looked at his sweaty back in his sweaty gray t-shirt and I hated myself for ever wanting this, for asking, for being so stupid to choose to ask, when I could choose not to.

And my wife has discovered the pills, although I wasn‚Äôt ready to talk about it, and she organised a therapy for us, I wonder why we didn‚Äôt in eight years, because its honestly great, we have regained the connection, and she opened up, and she shared her emotions, and now I understand her better, and I have said about the paranoia, about the anger, and she said I know you told me before.

And I have discovered my own detachment, the suppression of the last eight years, and yet these were the best years of my life and I love myself with my wife, but I now understand that I chose to burry myself in a sense, and I don‚Äôt want to lie there in the ground with Hubert, I want to get out, so I am choosing to write something - for the first time in eight years.

# Salvage #2

*‚ÄúUh, hello? Hello, hello? Uh, hey, congratulations on making it past your first week as an owner of Freddy's! So, uh, if you're hearing this, then there was another animatronic out there to be salvaged. The same routine should work on this one. Oh, and uh, also, word of advice: if you hear something from the audio prompt that isn't what was supposed to be playing, or if it activates without your input‚Ä¶ uh, don't break eye contact with the animatronic until the sounds stop. This shouldn't happen too often, but uh, you know, it‚Äôs best to be prepared for anything. I'm speaking from experience there. Almost got killed because of it, actually‚Ä¶ Uh, anyway, stay focused. It‚Äôll be over before you know it. Alright, good night.‚Äù*



Before you in the second salvage is a pile of junk and scrap, with wires and endoskeleton parts forming the basic facsimile of a body. It only has a shell on its hands and one of its two heads, the other dangling limply off its shoulder, with wires dangling out of the bare endoskeleton head‚Äôs slack jaw and vacant eye socket. The primary head of the animatronic is fox-like, with a broken ear and cracked eye socket. The once vibrant pink parts of this fox‚Äôs face are now dirty and desaturated, and its red lips and cheeks have met a similar fate. Its broad lower jaw is slightly crooked, with exposed wires dangling from the left side of it. This pitiful and unsightly creature is **Scrap Mangle.**

Scrap Mangle‚Äôs salvage process is similar to Chica‚Äôs, however they offer a slight escalation in difficulty and major increase in potential profit. Regarding difficulty, Mangle's garbled audio can occasionally play instead of the standard noises that should be playing, at which point you need to stare at them until it stops. Additionally, Scrap Mangle is harder to notice moving than Chica. Their first movement only has their seemingly vacant left eye socket suddenly gain a white pupil indicative of possessed animatronics, while the second head‚Äôs mouth slightly closes.

If you fail the minigame, Mangle will leap across the table and their jaws envelop your whole head, losing you the bonus. However, succeeding grants you a Salvage bonus of $500, plus an additional bonus of up to $250 if you get all your responses correct, leading to a value of $750.

Mangle doesn't say anything regardless of if you salvage them or lose to them. However, if you do salvage them, you can hear animal-like sounds mixed into their usual garbled radio.

At the end of each week, you receive your ending tally, which shows you all the revenue you gain from this week, your new visitors, returning visitors, visitors turned away, total visitors for the week, paychecks, and lawsuits. You don‚Äôt need to worry about the ladder two for this week unless you placed Scrap Chica on stage, so we can skip describing that for now. You also don‚Äôt get any Returning Visitors on the first week, with it only being new visitors shown. Revenue is separated into Food Revenue, Game Revenue, Bonus Revenue, Salvage Revenue, and Total Revenue, which is the previous four values added together. On the side, you can see Helpy and LolBit doing a celebratory dance on the side as the revenue climbs up.

That marks the end of the first day. This day acts as more of a tutorial day before you're thrust into the real Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Tycoon, beginning with the next cutscene. Well, after the tally of all the money you made that day from the restaurant and the salvage, and an end-of-night loading screen. At the bottom of the loading screen, you can see a man with long, messy, black hair, and sickly purple skin dressed in pajamas and a sleep mask and sleeping at the bottom of a bunk bed. LolBit can be seen in the top bunk, their arm dangling off the edge of the bed.



# Week 2: Introduction to employees¬†

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôve completed your first week at Freddy Fazbear‚Äôs Pizza with hopefully minimal casualties and property damage. Awesome! You‚Äôre now ready to expand your business. By now, you‚Äôve likely noticed that the workload is too intense for you to manage alone, so it‚Äôs best to outsource some of that workload to more disposable underlings. Unfortunately, this will mean having to share your earnings with them if you wish to stay open and out of the eye of law enforcement for as long as possible. Your employees come in all shapes and sizes, and all of them perform important tasks at your pizzeria, from cooking, to cleaning, to performing in mascot costumes. However, this does not mean that your restaurant will just run itself without any issue. You will occasionally need to check in and make sure no one is doing any unsavory acts. Also, be sure not to overcrowd your restaurant with employees, or else they may cut into your ever important income. That‚Äôs all, and remember to smile. You are the face of Freddy Fazbear‚Äôs Pizza.‚Äù*



This section exists to introduce you to a new mechanic in FNAF 6 remodeled: Employees. In the building section, there‚Äôs a new tab in the top right corner of your screen resembling a magazine. If you click it, you can find that it‚Äôs a Screws, Bolts, n‚Äô Hairpins magazine that was referenced in Sister Location. You open it up, and you are then shown a minigame where you can advertise your Pizzarea to the public. The image in the ad changes depending on how much you upgraded your restaurant, allowing you to clearly see your progress as you continue through the game. The establishment doesn‚Äôt have any impact on your applications, but it does impact how they interact with you and how much money you make at the end of the week.

Yes, I said interact. I‚Äôll get to that later.

After sending out your advertisement, you should probably start renovating and testing out new attractions you can add. At this point, you should have unlocked the next tier in the shop, *Edwin‚Äôs Budget Tech.*

If you buy the logbook, Michael will comment upon it by saying,

Mike: *""How did that get there?""*

Like in the original game, you can‚Äôt buy all the Mediocre Melodies just yet, and since you can only get the extended stage, you also can‚Äôt get the Trash n‚Äô the Gang achievement just yet. However, the Mediocre Melodies are a substantial upgrade, and it‚Äôs better to display them even if you do have Scrap Mangle in your inventory.

Speaking of Scrap Mangle, they‚Äôre a light animatronic like Scrap Chica, and they have an entertainment rating of 6, but also a liability rating of 11. This is because stats in this version of the game go past 9, with the limit for any stat being 50. Items with a stat level at or nearing 50 can only be found in the rare finds auction. That being said, the Scrap animatronics are the only animatronics who can reach liability ratings higher than 10. However, there is another way to get more liability if, for example, you were going for the Blacklisted ending. ***More on that later‚Ä¶***

The other way you can get higher liability is by hiring employees with a high liability rating. Starting on week 2, you can start hiring employees. The game presents you with 3 randomly selected candidates out of a larger pool for each job. They mostly have generic interactions with you, but there are a few with some unique dialogue.

Employees have their own Atmosphere, Entertainment, Health and Safety, Bonus Revenue, and Liability stats, but unlike the items you can buy, they don‚Äôt have a price tag. Instead, you have a paycheck you can give them which starts at minimum wage. You can give your employees raises, which boosts their productivity and enthusiasm, thus improving whatever stats their job specializes in.

After you choose your employees, you will be able to fire them whenever you want. Sometimes, this can lead to them coming back later on with altered stats and an altered design, but the hiring of new employees is overall pretty simple.

However, that‚Äôs not where things end, because when you exit blueprint mode, you are given the option to either go straight to the night section or ‚Äúoversee the restaurant.‚Äù If you pick the ladder option, you are taken not to a nighttime section, but instead to ***the Dayshift.***

Mark has significant physical disabilities and needs ongoing care, special equipment, the works. It wasn't written down maybe, but everyone knew his share was for his long-term care. My share was just mine.

I had this business idea I was passionate about, solid plan, looked really good on paper. But starting costs were steep. My share wasn't quite enough to launch it properly. I needed more capital.

So, I dipped into Mark's fund. Not all of it, not even half. I told myself it was an investment. A loan. If the business took off, I'd pay it back with interest, Mark's future would be more secure. That was the plan. I mentioned something vague to my aunt (who helps Mark day-to-day) about moving funds for an investment that would benefit Mark long term. Maybe I wasn't totally clear about the source? Things were hazy, it was stressful. She didn't really push back then, seemed distracted.

Well, the business hasn't worked out like I thought. Supplier problems, market changed, just bad luck. It's not totally failed, but it's struggling, losing money.

Now Mark urgently needs a new piece of equipment. Life-changing important kind of urgent. And the money I 'borrowed'? It's stuck. Tied up in the business. I can't just pull it out without killing the whole thing, which seems pointless now.

My aunt found out exactly how much was gone and where it went. She absolutely lost it. Screaming I stole from my disabled brother, put his future at risk. Mark knows too now. He doesn't get the business stuff, but he knows the money for his new chair isn't there. He just looks‚Ä¶ crushed. It feels awful, it really does. He just kept stirring his coffee while my aunt yelled, wouldn't even look at me. The family is furious, talking about lawyers to try and get assets from the business.

My defense, which no one is hearing, is that my intention was good! I wasn't trying to screw him over, I was trying to build something for both of us! It was a calculated risk, they don't always pay off right away. If it had worked, I'd be praised right now. It feels so unfair. Liquidating now destroys everything, including the chance to ever pay it back.

You can also do this trip without using any points in budget for 50k to 70k depending on number of days. 

Few tips : 

Normally flights from major cities in India will cost you 15k round trip. 

Hotels/ Hostels are very cheap you can get it for 1k per day also which are really good. 

Food is just amazing and I only had Vietnamese food , ate like local. There‚Äôs plenty of Indian restaurants if you only want Indian food. 

Use grab app for all your local rides. They are very reliable and cheap. 

For daily activities, you can compare the prices on apps like Klook/ agoda/ booking . Com and your hostel / hotel. Go with whoever provides best price. 

Bike renting is cheap , can get semi automatic and scooty for 300-600 rupees per day. 

If you‚Äôre on budget and want local experience and have time to spend do take train and bus rides from one city to another. 

Currency exchange can be done at town for good rate. Take USD from India. 

I also did some stupid shopping and spent additional 20küòÖ 


I had some lovely interactions with locals and also met a guy in Hoi an who‚Äôs from this sub.

Few background information: I am going alone and my hotel is about 1 hr of public transportation to the event. I have experience with cosplay for many years so I have no problem putting on my costume alone.

1. Should I change my clothes at the hotel first then travel to the event in costume, or should I change my clothes at the convention? 

2. Is it possible to walk into a coffee shop near the convention and change your costume in their restroom? (In my country it is acceptable to do so as long as I buy something but I don't know what it's like here)

3. How long (average) is the waiting time for the changing room? I assume it will be crowded and I should have no problem waiting for 15-30 mins. But if it takes longer I should better get dressed somewhere else beforehand. 

4. Does the cloakroom accept suitcase? My cosplay has some props that need to be stored in a large-sized suitcase.

5. Would it be weird or considered rude to wear cosplay costumes and go out to stores/restaurants/bakery/...? ",1,1744996858.0,animecons,0,1.0,False

1k2a99t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1k2a99t/not_the_worst_rodent_to_find_in_a_hotel_i_guess/,"Not the worst rodent to find in a hotel, I guess...","[This story comes from a place far above the front desk. Pictures in comments.]

So, I'm doing my maintenance thing one day, waking to check on this and fix that with Susan next to me. And I stop dead in my tracks. ""Susan!"" I point at the brick wall as we're walking through the open corridor where the main elevators come up from the lobby, on the top floor. Susan looks, but sees nothing. Her eyes are not what they used to be, to say the least. We walk closer, and I put my head next to hers (she's like my aunt; don't make it weird). ""Right there.""

""Oh. My. Is that...?""

""Sure looks like it.""

Now dear readers and veterans of front desk shenanigans. We've all seen things we wish we hadn't in the hotels we worked at--roaches scurrying when you flip on that switch in the back hallway by the pool, ""cupcakes"" that ruin your day and make you have cold chills from the thought of them for a week, that rat the size of a schnauzer that darts from the outside trash cans and dumpster. But this was a first for me at the hotel I was at, and I had no idea what the next step even was. Feel free to pause this story at this point and see the pics I plan on putting in the comments. 

So I googled, how to deal with bats indoors in [state I happen to live in, one of many where these little brown bats are protected]. And I called the chief engineer. 

""Hey, boss man. Got a fun one for you. Want to figure out what to do with a bat?""

""Like a baseball bat?""

""Nope. That would be easier.""

So, long story short, he comes up, looks at the thing, and calls animal control. Now this thing is literally just chilling on the wall. It's cold out, and he's probably trying to soak up some sun. A housekeeper walks by. ""Hey, if you see that thing move, let us know."" As much as I would have loved to babysit a bat all day, we had other things to do. 

The housekeepers eyes got big as softballs. ""Wtf is that?""

""A bat. I'm sure you'll be fine. We've only seen the one."" He slowly pushed his cart away, wary of the ceiling high above him. 

Anyway, animal control finally shows up with all the tools to take care of the job... *Not!* He has a badge, gloves, and, no joke, a folgers coffee can. Now, the corridor I'm talking about here is essentially an extension of the lobby, so that the several story high glass front and glass elevator is picturesque (or at least it was in the 70s when they built it). So there is an open overhang with a half wall 4 feet high on every level. About 10 feet of wall is past this overhang on each floor both in front going towards the front window and the back, and this being the top floor, the ceiling also goes up about 20 feet. 

So my bright idea, seconded by my happy-go-lucky chief, is to grab the pool net. So we navigated that thing, with its telescoping pole up way too many flights of stairs, and got the net around it. Animal control guy says, ""Just try to keep the net over him and gently coax him this way. Don't let him fly or we'll be here all night.""

So the Boss man starts dragging the little guy along the wall, slowly, and it starts clicking and screaming in the most terrifyingly adorable way. But he just side steps along with every nudge. Never did try to take off flying into the net, which is good, because he probably would have hurt himself. Finally we have the net over the overhang, and the animal control guy just grabs it, and shoves it in the coffee can. Work is done. 

The Boss Lady, very sad she missed the whole adventure (because she was busy managing a hotel or something), was very happy I had pictures to show her. She thought he looked adorable. 

""Well, you never know. You might see another. We probably have more. Seems pretty unlikely we'd only have one, right?""

She just gave me the fake smile she tended to give me when she knew she couldn't flip me off because she was in front of guests or cameras. ",29,1744996553.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,14,0.94,False

1k2a8ig,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k2a8ig,Bourbon soak update,"I soaked 6 lbs of Guatemalan beans with about two shots of bourbon for 6 days, roasted it yesterday to about 420, and cupped today.

It roasted fine, for the most part I just hit my normal roast curve for a batch of that size. Initially it did not have a lot of bourbon smell. After sitting overnight, I got super strong bourbon smell from the container.

Cupping - I cupped it along with a few other experimental coffees. SUPER STRONG bourbon flavor at the cupping table. Stringent, slightly sweet; it's like drinking a coffee with a shot of bourbon in it.


Next time I'll try one shot for 6 lbs and see how that goes. This one is good and the bourbon flavor definitely came through, but I couldn't imagine drinking a whole bag of it. I'll cup it again next week and see if it's mellowed out a bit.

I also had the idea of like, my Sunday LIVES being my ‚ÄúSelf Care Sunday‚Äù where they‚Äôre with me when I do my nails, lashes and other self care stuff. 

What do you guys think? 

I‚Äôd really like to make this work. I am a caregiver to my disabled children, so being on LIVE will be a source of income AND give me adult interaction all in one go.

**Part 7-Emily**

I last vented here when my now husband went missing.¬† I‚Äôm now here to know if I am wrong for what I am doing. I love my husband Walt, but I can‚Äôt keep doing this.¬†¬†¬†

11 years ago when Walt and I were engaged he went missing during a vacation trip to Thailand. He was missing for over 4 years. He was taken by a drug cartel that used him as a sort of slave labor. I found out right after he left for the trip I was pregnant with our son Paul. I became extremely close with his family during this time. I also met and fell in love with a man named Kevin, who I was engaged to. When Walt returned I found myself torn between picking up where we left off and continuing with Kevin. I chose to give Walt and I a chance. We got married a week later and I was pregnant with Bryan in less than a year.¬† We had another child, a daughter named Brianna, 2 years later.

One of the very last things Kevin said to me was, ‚ÄúThat place affected him (Walt) far more than he lets on‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

I was mad at him for saying that to me, not in the moment, but later on. I think he was right though. Walt and I really tried to make the best of everything, and it seemed like a movie romance the first year after our wedding. There were little moments where I got this feeling, but nothing I could really put my finger on.¬† Over the last 5 years though it‚Äôs been a steady decline. In the early days it was night sweats and the occasional outburst over something seemingly small. I knew he had done therapy upon return for the first few months but stopped when he and I began reconnecting. I later got out of him all his therapist and he worked on was coping with the loss of me though. He has never processed the PTSD he endured from being held captive. He needs therapy.¬†

I have finally stopped lying to myself and accepted that he is a functional alcoholic. The thing is the functional part of the term is becoming less and less true.¬† He is quickly becoming someone I can‚Äôt count on for anything.¬† I am doing my best to keep the family together and afloat. I have made a schedule so that I can always be the one to get the kids places, because I don‚Äôt trust him to drive. He tries to hide it. I have found alcohol stashed around the house. When he‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù he can be a great Dad and loving husband.¬† When he‚Äôs not he is a mess. The problem is he‚Äôs only ‚Äúgood‚Äù when he has a couple drinks in him.¬† It's a fine balance between the sober irritable short tempered man, the had a few and functional man, and the had too many sloppy emotional wreck of a man.¬†¬†¬†¬†

These are the main things. Our home life is far from what I pictured for us. Our oldest Paul has to play parent to the other 2 far too often because his father can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt trust him to drive them anywhere.¬† Our relationship is faltering, I feel like I‚Äôm doing this on my own. The bedroom is almost dead and I miss the connection.

I am going to give him an ultimatum. I know they rarely work. I know he needs to do this for himself or it won‚Äôt stick. I just feel like I have to give him one last chance. He will start an alcohol treatment program. He will go to therapy.¬† He will go to couples counseling with me. I had a lawyer draw up divorce papers to show that I am serious. I won‚Äôt file yet, he will have his chance.

**Part 8-Kevin**¬†¬†

After 9 years of ignoring requests for an update, u/Gwen_Luvs_A_Dbl made the request on the right day. I think it might have to do with me feeling a little bit more alive than usual. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am a pretty happy guy in general. I love my family.¬† I guess that should be part of the update. I met my wife, Carly (39F), about a year after my engagement to Emily ended. We've been married almost 7 years. We have a 6 year old daughter and her 14 year old son (Grant) from her first marriage (His Dad and I get along well. My step son calls me Kevin, probably always will, but we still have a really good relationship I wouldn't trade for anything.)¬†

I am still running my screen printing business. It‚Äôs actually been going really well. I had to move to a larger location. I was at the front desk when a disgruntled former employee came in. The rest of the staff were in the back, and Carly, who does not work with me, had stopped by to drop me off some lunch during her lunch break. I had to fire this guy for incompetence. He was supposed to be a graphic designer, in hindsight I think his portfolio was someone else‚Äôs. His ego was the worst part. He would make designs, the customer would ask for corrections, he would redesign it with the corrections, then still put his original design on the file.¬† The first time was a mistake, the second time was a termination.¬†¬†

I still can‚Äôt believe what actually happened. He came in ranting about how I owed him money for the designs he did, that we did not use, ever. I tried to tell him peaceably that he needed to leave and he started cussing me. Carly, never one to back down from anything, told him to leave immediately or the police would be called.¬† He said to her, ‚ÄúShut it Bitch!‚Äù I came around the counter at that point, and Carly moved to behind it. She was going for her phone, I waved her off, and got right in front of the guy. He spit at me.¬† At this point, calling my wife a bitch, and spitting on me. I was done being the bigger person.¬† 25 years of bottling it up was about to come out. I read through a lot of my old comments, and my High School story came up a lot.¬† Well, here it is, here‚Äôs why.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

My brother and I were raised in a Boxing house. Our Dad loved boxing, he put us in boxing classes at a young age and we kept in them all the way until High School. Even then my Brother and I would spar a little here and there just to keep up with it.

In High School, I was your stereotypical popular guy. I was smart, well liked, and a 3 sport star (Football, Wrestling, Baseball). I had a girlfriend I had since middle school and we were each other's first everything. It was early in my Senior year, I was the starting QB on the team, and we were pretty good. Notably we had 2 guys on the team, Tyler and Zach, who were really good and were getting recruited by a few Division 2 schools. They were best friends and honestly two of the biggest jerks I had ever encountered. They played a lot of mean pranks, constantly talked trash to anyone about anything, and would try to get with the girlfriends of the guys on the team they didn't like, just all around D-Bag behavior. They thought they were really tough too, I mean they were big and strong, but you could tell they were the kind of guys who had never been punched in the face before.

I guess going into our senior year my girlfriend was starting to feel like she was ""wasting her youth"" being in a long term relationship with me. Which I could have moved past if she would have told me this or just broke up with me in the first place. She decided though to just go ahead with her ""exploration"" without informing me of the change in our relationship status. It was the night after our first win and of course there was a house party. I typically didn't go to these in season, or very often. I also had to work this night (Movie theatre).

I get a call from a friend of mine that my girlfriend was seen making out with Tyler, and that they just went into one of the bedrooms together. In a knee jerk reaction, I tell my coworker I got to go and head that way. It was about 15-20 minutes to get to the party. The second I walked in I could see eyes go on me, some people felt that overwhelming awkwardness you feel when you know something crazy is about to happen. Others laughed and made comments. Zach blocked me from going down the hall and we were getting in each other's faces when Tyler came out in just a pair of compression undershorts. They both stood over me trying to intimidate me, then threatened to beat my ass if I didn't leave.

I turned around and headed for the front door. Tyler and Zach began calling me derogatory names and making a show. Other people laughed and made comments. Once out the front door I pulled my cell and called Kyle. He was there in 10 minutes.

When we walked back in together Tyler and Zach were standing there in the middle of the room together, Tyler was redressed, and my girlfriend was standing with them. When they saw us she just turned and ran out the other side of the room. I will never forget the shocked face on Tyler and Zach. We didn't say anything, each of us just walked up and shoved them against the wall then stepped back, giving them the universal ""come on"" sign.

I could see in their eyes they wanted nothing to do with us. They had always built themselves on being the big bad asses. Really they were just bullies, they picked on smaller guys and easy targets. Now they messed up, here were two guys that weren't as big and strong, but were fit and confident saying, ""Let's find out.""

They had no choice, it was either fight or give up that bad boy reputation. There were a couple dozen people standing around watching. When they charged us, it wasn't a fight, it was a massacre.

In addition to the usual bloody noses and black eyes, I had also broken Tyler's jaw. Kyle had cracked Zach's ribs. Each of them missed a few weeks of the season. When the colleges inquired as to why they were injured, it didn't take long for them to find out it was because of a fight. They stopped calling.

We always wondered if law enforcement would get involved, they never did. Our father gave us one hell of speech though. I've carried that with me ever since. Those two were jerks, but I felt like I took their future away. They both came from broken homes and were just scared kids. They didn't have what me and Kyle had. They never ended up going to college and here 25 years later I know they never left our hometown or really amounted to anything.

I have been the bigger person everyday since then. Not today. I shoved him back and when he stepped forward again he got met with a quick jab and hard right hook. He flopped on the floor like a fish. Trying to get up but too woozy to steady himself. Carly came over and he started to cry a little. We walked him out to his car and put him in the driver's seat. About 7 minutes later he started it and drove off.

For whatever reason it got me thinking about my past with Emily. Of all the times I took the high road in my life, back when Walt came back was the time I regretted the most. But not anymore, it was good to get this out of my system. And it got me reflecting. As I look back at that whole situation, everything played out even better. Here at the end, I have an amazing wife, two great kids, and a thriving business. I don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôre doing, I hope well, but I think I ultimately won.¬†¬†

**Part 9-Emily**

I had the craziest WTF moment of my life this morning.¬† First, off, because I'm sure once people look at my profile they'll start asking about Walt.¬†¬†

We are still together, he did everything I asked and more.¬† He has been sober for 7 years now. He has moved onto a good architectural firm and is focused mostly on Commercial builds now. Which has been really good for our family. We moved to a new bigger house on the other side of the city.¬†¬†

The only complaint I could possibly have is he has kind of become a workaholic. I appreciate all we have now, but sometimes wish he had more time with the kids and I. I don't say anything, it's leaps and bounds better than when he was drinking. I would say our relationship has gone from life support to about 80% good.¬†

This has to do mostly with our daughter, Brianna, and her new friend, Addison. Brianna just turned 10 and is in competitive cheer. We sent her to a weekend camp at a college a few weeks ago. She roomed with 3 other girls, but she really hit it off with Addison. Since she has been back she has been messaging Addison non-stop. They live on the other side of metro Indianapolis of course, so getting together for just a hang out has been more difficult to make happen. Anyway, Brianna has been begging for a sleepover with Addison so we made that happen. I talked to her mom Carly on the phone, and this past weekend she came over.

On Saturday afternoon they arrived at our house. I did not expect Carly to look like a model, but that woman is hot, I was glad Walt was at the office (jk).¬† We exchanged some pleasantries and Addison came in. Brianna and her immediately took off to Brianna‚Äôs room. She was really a delightful girl and they had a fun sleepover. Carly did tell me before she left that her Dad would pick her up the next day.¬†¬†

That is when the shocking part happened. Her Dad, of all people, is my ex-fiance Kevin. When I answered the door and saw him standing there we both just looked at each other like deer in headlights. I couldn‚Äôt believe it, Walt came over and saw who it was, and with no chill in his system at all audibly gasped. I have never ever been in a more awkward moment in my life.¬†¬†

Kevin had no idea what to say and just started with, ‚ÄúHey guys, nice place you got here.‚Äù I just stood there and said, ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù like a brain dead idiot. Luckily, the girls interrupted, and said their goodbyes. Kevin gave us the ‚ÄúThanks for having her‚Äù and they left.¬†

It always amazes me how the world has a way of bringing your past back when you least suspect it.¬†

**Part 10-Walt** ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

A long time ago I turned to this to talk about how my world ended, and I somehow came back from that. I don‚Äôt know if I can come back from this shit.¬†

I lost my sons.¬†

My oldest son Paul. He went to college, he graduated, he got a job near the college.¬† My younger son Bryan. He went to the same college, he was just a Freshman. I picked them up from the airport 4 days before Christmas. We got on I-70 out of the airport and were heading home.¬†

It was cold, and a little icy. I thought Bryan should practice driving in the conditions. Him being shorter than I am, his brother sat behind him. We came upon the accident. It looked bad. We managed to stop, I thought everything was fine.¬†¬†

From the report, I guess the driver of the semi-truck had gotten a text, and decided to check it. I guess it was a long text because I don‚Äôt know how you don‚Äôt see the taillights. He basically ran over the driver‚Äôs side of the car.¬† They were crushed and killed instantly.¬† I had a shattered leg, lots of bruising, lots of cuts.

In the few months following, Emily has grown cold to me. She is hurting, she cries so much. Brianna is doing her best to take it in stride, she misses her big brothers. I can't do much, my leg is so badly damaged it will be months before I can walk. Emily doesn‚Äôt care, she blames me. Thinks I was stupid to have him drive then. I know it was stupid but you never fucking know. She thinks it should have been me, I should have been driving then they would have sat on the other side, the side that survived.¬†¬†

The only thing getting me through the day right now are the meds they prescribed me. I really shouldn‚Äôt take them as a recovering alcoholic, but I need them right now while I recover.¬†

¬†I wish I had died in that wreck.¬†

**Part 11-Kevin**

Two years ago I (56M) lost my wife and step-son in a terrible accident.¬† The accident they were in caused a pile up that stopped traffic around it. This caused my ex-fianc√©e Emily‚Äôs (51F) family (her then husband and 2 sons) to come to stop on the Interstate. A truck did not notice in time, and ran over their car.¬† Killing her two sons, and crippling her then husband, Walt.¬†

Our daughters had been best friends for a few years at that point. I often avoided much interaction with them. Even though I had moved on, the reminder wasn‚Äôt pleasant.

In the two years since then, Emily and I have continued on as single parents of daughters. Our girls got closer after the accident, each having lost their older brothers. Because of all of this I have been interacting with Emily more and more, especially since her divorce from ex-husband Walt a year ago.¬†

Roughly a month ago Emily and I began texting privately. We had only been talking at events that involved both of the girls,which wasn‚Äôt very many as they went to different High Schools. We have been sort of trauma bonding. Each of us has our bad days, and it has been kind of nice to have someone who ‚Äúgets it‚Äù to talk to.¬†¬†

I‚Äôm having all of these feelings. I miss waking up next to someone. I do feel like Emily and I have a connection. I just don‚Äôt know if I should share this with her. Given our past and how relatively close the end of her marriage is. However, I have been thinking a lot about trying to rekindle our romantic relationship. I just don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs fair to her, to put that out there at this time. She has lost both of her sons, was in a relationship with a man who had multiple addictions and severe PTSD for 20 years, and honestly the reality that she left me for him still weighs into everything.¬†

I‚Äôm also thinking about our girls. I would hate to create a rift between them. They are so close and really lean on each other.¬†¬†

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I know what I want to do, but don‚Äôt know if it is the right thing to do.

**Part 12-Emily**

I‚Äôm typing this as a sort of memoir. Life has been very hard but still I feel relatively blessed now.¬† I just celebrated my 60th birthday a few weeks ago. My husband Kevin (65M) and I went on a cruise together. He isn‚Äôt legally my husband, we didn‚Äôt get remarried, but I consider him the same and he considers me his wife. We have ‚Äúofficially‚Äù been back together for about 8 years now. 3 years ago we welcomed OUR first grandchild when his daughter Addison gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Our daughters, Brianna and Addison, really embraced being sisters, not surprising they were already best friends.¬†

In the last years we have watched them both get married. Welcomed our above mentioned first grandchild and now are making some major preparations as they are both pregnant, and due just 5 weeks apart.¬†

It hasn‚Äôt been all good times. Walt passed away 4 years ago at 55 years old. It was hard on Brianna. Decades ago he ended up captive to drug smugglers for several years. He managed to be rescued but was never the same again. He had PTSD that he left untreated for over a decade. He coped through alcohol, when he got sober, he coped through work. When we lost our sons and he became disabled, the pills became his new crutch. Then he went back to drinking. Brianna and I managed to intervene. We got him cleaned up one more time. Then 2 years after he died from heart failure. I still feel guilty for blaming him for the death of our sons. It wasn‚Äôt his fault, he made a bad decision, but it wasn‚Äôt his fault.¬†

Kevin and I danced around getting back together for a whole year after he first brought it up. For the most part he was pushing for it, he didn‚Äôt over do it. That has never been Kevin, he is literally the most boundary respecting person I have ever met. That didn‚Äôt stop him from trying to win me over though. We had a lot of long talks, and we went on some dates. We kissed here and there. I think I just wasn‚Äôt ready for a lot of that year.¬†

We ended up sleeping together one night. He kind of looked at me the next morning like, ‚ÄúAre we going to keep pretending.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI know what you are thinking but I just don‚Äôt know? Isn‚Äôt it weird? What about the girls, what if this doesn‚Äôt work out?‚Äù I wanted him, and I made every excuse I could think of to not embrace it. That same day after I left his house, he planned his last great gesture. He tells me it was going to be his last, but I don‚Äôt believe that lol. I went home, got cleaned up and changed. I was going to get my day going and Starbucks was first on the list. It was a little busy so I guess that made hiding for him easier. As I was about to scan my app, he butted in and scanned for me. I looked up to see him standing there. I looked at him in this bewildered kind of way. We moved over to get my order and he said, ‚ÄúThought maybe you would be more comfortable if we started from the beginning.‚Äù I just smiled, we sat and had coffee. My other plans could wait. We talked for a while and as we were both about to leave, he handed me his business card. I said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre moving into cringey territory now.‚Äù and laughed. He said, ‚ÄúIs it working?‚Äù I nodded, ‚ÄúYes, just follow me back to my place, I can run errands tomorrow.‚Äù

  
He did just that and we‚Äôve been together ever since. I often reflect back and wonder if this is what the two decades in between would have been like if I had chosen him the first time. I don‚Äôt think either of us has regrets, we had and have wonderful children, but that doesn‚Äôt stop the thought. I know there‚Äôs no way of knowing, so I‚Äôll just have to enjoy what this universe has given me for as long as I can. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†",3,1744996136.0,Fiction_Stories,0,1.0,False

I just figured out why I‚Äôve felt so sick. I thought it was stress. It‚Äôs not,¬† I‚Äôm now 12 or so weeks pregnant.¬† I just went to the OB today and had everything confirmed.¬† I‚Äôm so scared. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to do this on my own if he doesn‚Äôt come back. My parents are nearing 70 at this point, my brother is 40 and lives halfway across the country. I need my fiance, I need Walt.¬†¬†

I‚Äôm not looking for any advice, I just needed to vent. I think the hardest part is just not knowing what happened to him.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

**Part 2-Walt**

Five years ago I (Walt 28M) made a choice that royally fucked up my life. I had a lot going for me. At the time I was the new guy at my firm. I was an architect (Mostly subdivisions) and really enjoying it. I had a long term girlfriend of 3 years (Emily 29F), that I had recently become engaged to. I really thought nothing could derail me.

After Emily said yes, we began planning the wedding. We were not up for the big wedding thing. We agreed we would have an elopement to a coastal city (San Diego became the plan) parents/siblings were welcome to come if they wanted, but basically we were just booking a honeymoon and getting married while we were there.

Since this whole trip was going to be, relatively speaking, inexpensive. We decided to splurge on pre wedding activities. Now, neither of us wanted traditional Bachelor/Bachelorette parties. We agreed we would scratch off ""bucket list items."" Emily wanted to swim with sharks, and booked herself one of those cage diving excursions (She‚Äôs not scuba diver or anything, just always been fascinated by sharks.) Her and her best friend Maggie went to Florida for a long weekend and did just that. Mine was quite a bit more. I had always wanted to visit Thailand. It was one of those dumb things I got fascinated with as a 10 year old and swore I was going to go.

Emily actually encouraged me, pointing out that I literally brought up Thailand on our first date. We were 6 months into our engagement when the time came for me and my best friend (Jorge) to leave on the trip. For the first 3 days everything was great. We were enjoying beaches, visiting temples, and drinking a lot. On the 3rd night though Jorge got absolutely smashed drunk. I was a little pissed about this and tried to slow him down. The next day we were supposed to go on a jungle excursion. Being young dumb guys, we didn‚Äôt really book these in advance, and had been just adding things to do as we went.¬† On our first day here I saw a few places offering jungle excursions and decided I was doing that and told Jorge I wanted to do that on Thursday of our trip.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

The next morning Jorge had a world class hangover, and refused to get up at all, and said we can book an excursion tomorrow. My thought was , ""Fuck that"" I'm going today. I had seen ads for a few places that did these. I went out to get some breakfast and spotted a guy on the side of the road offering the Jungle excursion cheap. He had a Jeep and when he noticed me looking at his sign, moved in with the hard sell. Honestly it did look a little shady, but the guy spoke English so well it gave me a false sense of security. I decided to go with this guy.

I get in and for a while it's actually pretty fun. He pulls off the main road on these off road paths. I have no idea where we are going. We end up deep down these roads. I'm enjoying it for the most part though. Then everything went sideways.

We stopped in this small clearing, and I was checking some things out, when out of nowhere a larger group of shady individuals pulls up from a different path.¬† I was freaking out, my guide and these others were speaking the Khmer language I was completely unfamiliar with.¬† I'm not going to go into what the next 4 and a half years were like but Hell is an easy comparison. They needed a manual labor mule. I was the dumbass that walked into the trap.¬† It was everyday, loading and unloading, digging, fixing things. I was kept in the middle of nowhere, chained to my cot every night.¬† I knew I couldn‚Äôt survive running aimlessly into the jungle.¬† Sticking to the paths would have gotten me caught.¬† The camp would move around every so often, I was always blind folded when we moved. My guide would be by occasionally. He would talk to me, mostly just to make sure I was still in line but I could get little bits of information out of him.¬† I also started to pick up some of the language, enough anyway. They were making meth. I was their slave, and I could do nothing. I had to wait it out.

During this time, after no one came for me, I realized they all thought I was dead. I had gone missing. Jorge had no idea where I was, I had called back home the morning I was abducted and left messages, but they only knew I was going on a jungle excursion. My parents, my fiancee, I missed them so much. There were plenty of days I was hoping one of these guys would just take me out already, especially after the first year when I became more tolerant of the food and water.

Finally, after 55 months in captivity a miracle happened. The camp got raided. I was still chained to the cot and in my rags that I wore for clothes at this point. The authorities arrested me as well, but quickly realized what my situation was.¬† A search of a database found my missing persons report from Thailand.¬† I had nothing to my name (They took my passport, ID long ago) and was in a country I wasn't supposed to be in. I contacted the embassy. They helped me contact home. I attempted to contact my Fiancee but a guy named Mitch answered and he did not know an Emily, so I figured she must have changed her number at some point. I called my mother.

She was absolutely frantic. She grabbed my father and I told her my entire tale. I kept asking about Emily and my mother kept deflecting. She wanted to get started immediately getting me home, and said we would talk about everything when I got back to the US. It took a little while to make this happen. During that time they sent me money and I was able to get a hotel. My parents were very very adamant I not try to contact Emily during this time and to wait until we got back.

I obviously started to assume she had moved on and was with someone else. Which was heartbreaking. I had held out hope during my captivity that she would not, but with the way my parents were acting I assumed that was the case.

Even so I wanted to contact her immediately, before anything else. I didn't want to talk about my time there, I didn't want to talk about what they did trying to find me, or know anything about anyone else. I just wanted my fiancee.

My parents sat me down and handed me a save the date card. It was Emily and some tall handsome guy I'd never seen before. She was engaged. I broke down, it wasn't unexpected, but the feelings were still there. I asked my parents if they had kept in touch with her beyond just being wedding guest worthy. They said yes, they've actually been a huge part of each other's lives these last few years.

I was a little shocked, I know they liked Emily, but with me gone I had somewhat expected them to drift apart, not get closer.

I decided to ask, ""So how close are you guys now?"" My mother responded, ""Very, her father passed a year ago and your Dad has agreed to walk her down the aisle."" That hurt, it shouldn't, but it did.

""Why you?"" Was all I could say. My mom got emotional, started going on about how they all thought I was gone, that they looked so hard and so long. They had a whole memorial service for me. I snapped a little, ""I don't care about that right now, what are you not telling me.""

My mother took that tablet and flipped a few photos. She then handed it back to me. There was a whole group photo. My parents, Emily, her fiance, her mom, my sister, my brother, Emily's brother, Jorge, other friends and kids. But at the center of the table was a boy sitting behind a birthday cake. The decorations read ""Happy 4th Birthday"" He was smiling big. I just looked at my parents.

My mother looked at me and said, ""That's your son, Paul Walter Ryne.""

**Part 3-Walt**

In the two weeks since I got back home it simultaneously feels like so much has happened, and that virtually nothing has happened. I have been largely brought up to speed on all that has happened on this side of the world.

When Jorge finally got up out of bed that day years ago he tried to call me. After having no success (they smashed my phone). He decided to just go about his day, assuming I was enjoying my excursion. It wasn't until it was well past dark that he started to get concerned. He called back home to see if anyone else had heard from me. The next morning my family and fiancee were blowing up his phone wondering if I had come back yet. That's when he began venturing out to all the legit excursion places. They all reported that they had not seen me. He began to panic and alerted everyone back home. He went to the authorities at this point. My parents, brother and fiancee all made the trip to join him. They spent a month canvassing the area before they had to go back. My parents made another trip to Thailand to try and find me, but again turned up nothing. Over the next year and half they were a constant reminder to the Thai officials of my disappearance.

Meanwhile, my fiancee Emily came to the realization she was pregnant. On the day I left for Thailand, she was unknowingly around 10 weeks. I can only imagine how hard it was on her. I'm missing, she's pregnant with my child. I wish I had never gone.

My parents told me Emily really leaned on them, and they were happy to help. Over the years they've just grown closer and closer. Her parents were there, and supportive, but they are much older than mine and not in as good of health. My mom ended up taking Emily to a lot of her OB appointments. She was there in the delivery room along with Emily's mom. It was apparently very stressful as Paul was born at just 34 weeks. Luckily, he showed no signs of health problems.

My parents tell me they needed this. The anguish of not knowing what happened to me was very hard, and the birth of their grandson provided a much needed respite from the grief. They keep telling me how sorry they are, but they didn't do anything wrong. I guess it's just guilt now that they know I was out there, and they ""failed"" to find me.

Jorge has been by to see me. He has apologized far too many times. He's gotten married since the trip, and has two kids now. He seems nervous around me, and I guess that's fair, I do hold some resentment towards him. It's not his fault, but the feeling is there anyway.

My brother and sister have marched on with life. My brother has kids now, and my sister is married. I missed all of this. I could probably get over all of that, but losing my fiancee and missing out on 4 years with my son, it's been too much.

My parents have set me up with a therapist. I went to the first session but have no idea what to talk about. I was treated like a work mule for 4.5 years, beaten at times, starved at times. Plenty of PTSD. My whole family thought I was dead, so much so they had a memorial service for me 3 years to the day of my disappearance. I was supposed to marry the love of my life, and she is now engaged to someone else. Then to top it all off, I have a 4 year old son, who has been raised by ""my replacement"" since he was 18 months old. Paul only knows this guy as Dad, he calls him Dad, and now here I am, back from the dead to fuck up everyone else's perfect little lives.

I'm ranting though. It's just too much to unpack. I still haven't directly spoken to Emily. My father went to her house the day after my return. He sat her and her fiance (Kevin 34M) down, told them I had been found. She began to tear up, she thought he was saying my body had been recovered. When he corrected her, she had a complete breakdown. Her fiance comforted her, my Dad said she was just silent afterwards.

I tried texting her, I got no response for a whole day, then just a ""I'm so sorry, I just can't right now."" I haven't asked anyone about her fiance, other than I know she's been engaged for about 2 months, and the wedding is supposed to be in 6 months from now. No one has volunteered any information at this point.

We were supposed to all meet at the park this past weekend. My resurgence has thrown the harmony out of whack and I can tell everyone is a little off. My mother typically watches Paul while Emily and Kevin are at work. A lot of time it's at her house, but since I showed up it's been exclusively over at Emily's. I hear they are prepping him to meet me. He is aware I'm his father. My pictures are all over at my parents house. Emily has apparently always had a picture of me up in Paul's room. I'm a shell of the guy in the picture, but I guess at least I kinda look like that still. He won't be totally blind sided.

My parents and I arrived at the park first. When we saw their car pull up. Only Kevin and Paul got out. Emily was not with them. Paul ran up to my Dad first and gave him a big hug. He saw me and kind of retreated to my Mom, then over to Kevin. I could tell he was nervous, I mean shit, so was I and I'm not 4 years old. The other adults tried to say something to get us to talk or embrace or something. I told them to let it go, let him go play. He perked up and ran off to the playground.

Kevin came up and stuck his hand out. We shook, and he said, ""Sorry, Emily, couldn't today. We were about out the door and she broke down, told me she wasn't ready."" I just said, ""I understand.""

I went over to the playground to try and bond in some way. Turns out Paul is big into super heroes. He pretended to be Spider-Man and I had to be Rhino. I chased him all over the playground, and let him ""web me up."" He laughed and smiled. When the food was ready I was happy to see he liked his hotdogs the same as me. Ketchup on one side, mustard on the other, relish on top. I thought maybe this won't be so hard. Then he called Kevin ""Dad"".

I shouldn't have been surprised by this, he's been in this kid's life for 2.5 years, he is marrying his mom, they all live in the same house. That all said, it was like a knife in the heart, I began to actually tear up. I excused myself for a moment, and said I was going over to the gross park bathroom. When I came out after a minute Kevin was waiting.

I could see my parents across the way watching Paul. I felt instantly awkward, the last thing I wanted right now was a heart to heart with Kevin. He was taller than me, more built than me, and had gotten to have the life I was supposed to have. He just said, ""Can we talk?"" I said, ""Yeah, man, what's on your mind?""

Kevin began, ""Look, I'm sorry for what happened to you, it's a bad deal all around. I just wanted to talk because I'm worried about Emily and Paul. Emily more than him. She hasn't been herself, which I can appreciate to some degree, it took a long time for her to get over you. I'm the first person she dated after your incident. She cried the first time we kissed because ""it was different"". I want you to have a relationship with your son, he's little, he's resilient. I had two Dads growing up, I know he will be fine. I don't know how fine her or you will be if this goes too fast, and from a selfish standpoint I don't want anything disrupting our life or our engagement. I love her, and want what's best. I'd like you two to take it slow and process everything before you meet. I made an appointment for her to see a counselor. I'd appreciate it if you could respect that and not push her or reach out to her. Let her figure things out on her own first.""

I was pissed listening to him, pretentious ass, but fuck he had some points. I don't want to rip open all these old wounds. I ended up just saying, ""Yeah man, I can do that."" And walked off to join my parents and Paul. Kevin went into the gross bathroom. When he came back over he said him and Paul were going to head out. Paul gave everyone hugs, including me. I was surprised, but pleasantly. Then he called me Rhino, and ran off to Kevin. As they left I heard him say, ""Dad can we get a Cookie Cake on the way home?""

Ugh, He's Dad, I'm Rhino, and this just fucking sucks.

**Part 4-Walt**

We finally met. We started by texting a bit, but it felt so impersonal the conversations stayed at a surface level. The deepest we really got was talking about Paul and me briefly divulging what captivity was like.

Over the 3 weeks between our first text exchange and our meet up we only texted maybe 5 times, and each time it started to get into heavy subjects one of us would end the conversation.

During that time though I did spend more time with Paul. My mother began watching him at her house again and that gave us time to bond. I even had some one-on-one time with him when we went to get ice cream together one day. It's amazing how resilient kids are, he just goes with the flow of everything. He still calls me Rhino, but maybe I'll get the ""Dad"" title soon....

One day this past week, when Kevin came by to pick up Paul, he asked to talk again. This time he had a job offer for me, which had me getting pissed. Then he elaborated that it wasn't really an offer but more of a lead. His brother owns a construction company and is looking for an estimator. Kevin told his brother I was once an architect and his brother said he'd give me an interview if I was interested. He left his brother's card with me. I really want to hate Kevin, but he does actually seem to be a genuinely nice person, which also pisses me off. His self-deprecating sense of humor grows on you fast, and this is just in 5-10 minute interactions with him. But at the same time, ""Fuck that Guy.""

I talked to Emily via text this past Friday. We agreed to meet the next day for lunch. I suggested this Italian place that had been ""our"" place, but she got a little upset about this and I thought she was going to cancel. Instead we pivoted to Applebee's.

Seeing her in person I can't even describe. She was just as beautiful as ever. The hello hug caused a shiver through my spine, I didn't want to let go, and may have lingered for just a second, but also didn't want to make it weird. We exchanged pleasantries and small talk through the ordering, and at that point the conversation took the first serious turn since my return, and it stayed that way for the next hour as we talked.

She told me how hard it was to deal with ""my death."" She was pregnant and grieving, and a lot of days didn't want to carry on. It hurts so bad to listen to what she was going through. She told me she felt so alone anytime she was in our apartment that she spent most nights staying at her parents or mine. She kept hoping that everytime the phone rang it would be someone with news about me, and then began to hope it wasn't, because as time went on it became more likely that it would be a call that they found my body. She told me about how great my parents, and to a lesser degree my siblings had been to her. My SIL and her even had slightly overlapping pregnancies so it was fun to have someone to talk to about it.

It was after Paul's first birthday, that my parents of all people, talked to her about ""getting back out there."" She admitted she was really only spending time with her parents, my parents, or my SIL and by extension my brother. She said she even fell off hanging out with her best friend. Emily told me it was fear. She never wanted to be away from Paul, if I could disappear in an instant, then that means anyone could. She wouldn't be able to live without him. After this intervention, she realized she was living like a widow and not a 25 year old woman. She began hanging out with her friends again, letting others watch Paul occasionally so she could go out.

It was 2 months into her attempts at living life that she ran into Kevin. They were in a Starbucks, she was fumbling trying to get her phone out while holding Paul. When suddenly this tall handsome fucker (my words) comes up and scans his phone, buying her coffee and muffin. They strike up a conversation while waiting. When her order gets called, he grabs it and hands it to her along with a business card with his cell number on it (Kevin owns a screen printing shop). Tells her, ""No pressure, but I'd like to get to know you better."" Then they part ways. She called him the next day. 4 months later she introduced Paul to him. A year later they moved in with him and a few months ago they got engaged.

This is where I said my piece. I told her I still loved her, that it's impossibly hard to see her with someone else. The idea of getting back to her was one of the few things that kept me going when I was locked away. She began to cry, and I reached out and took her hand. I asked if she was sure, or if there was any way we could try again (In hindsight I feel like this was a dick move, but at the time I needed to know.)

She shook her head. Looked up at me and said, ""I love you, I never stopped, but I love Kevin too, and I'm marrying him. It's not fair, I know it's not fair, you didn't do anything wrong, but I had to move on. I spent years thinking you had died. When you came back I was so happy, but also so guilty."" I cut her off there, ""You have nothing to feel guilty about, I fucked up and cost myself everything. I always knew you'd likely moved on, and I don't fault you for that, I was gone, there was no reason for you to believe I was coming back, but I did dream that I'd find my way back and you'd be there when I returned. I realize that was unrealistic. I'm sorry for putting you in this position now."" She said, ""It's okay, I knew this was coming eventually.""

We just kind of stopped talking at that point. Sat there just drinking our drinks. After a few minutes that seemed like eternity, she said, ""How do you want to move forward when it comes to Paul?"" I told her, ""I love him already and want to be in his life."" She replied, ""I'm so happy for that, I always told him about you, I didn't want him to think he was abandoned."" I said, ""He is the one bright spot in this whole situation.""

From there she told me that Kevin had planned to adopt him once they were married but wouldn't now that I have returned. I am listed on the birth certificate as the father, although I think I'll meet with a lawyer just to make sure everything is in place from a legal standpoint. I do appreciate she named him after My father and I, and also gave him our last name.¬†¬†

We made some plans to meet together later in the week with Paul. Let him have fun with all of his parents at the same time. She also encouraged me to do more one-on-one with him.

At the end we hugged one more time and parted ways. When I got back to my parents house and in my room, I broke down. The finality of it all was just too much. After I recovered I decided I was not going to wallow in my grief anymore. I needed to swallow some pride, and get on track to do something with myself. The next day I called Kevin's brother and did an interview that day. He hired me. This is the first step towards moving on.

**Part 5-Walt**

Holy shit, you are not gonna believe what I'm about to tell you. These last 6 months have been nothing short of absolutely fucking crazy, but in a good way.

After my first initial face to face with Emily, I decided I needed to move on with my life, and I ended up getting hired to be an estimator for Kevin's brother Kyle's (36M) construction company. It was going well and at about the 2 month mark Kyle, knowing I was an architect, started asking me to design some of his custom builds and would compare them to the usual architect he was using. He was liking mine better, and while I still work as an estimator, I am now solely designing the custom homes for Kyle and he gave me a huge raise. This allowed me to get my own apartment and I'm thankful to say I am no longer living in my parents house.

Emily and Kevin's wedding plans progressed with only one major change. My father was no longer walking her down the aisle, as everyone felt it was inappropriate given my return. Her much older brother was going to take that role (Emily was an oops baby, so her brother is 16 years older than her).

After our initial lunch, I saw Emily a lot more often. We were making it a point to do something all together with Paul at least once a week. Kevin was there as well, but they kept the ""couple"" behavior to a minimum. It was fun. I especially enjoyed getting to talk to Emily and just be around her. After a month of this back to school season hit. I guess in the screen printing industry this is the busy season. Which I guess makes sense with fall sports, staff shirts, clubs, Greek life. Kevin has contracts with all the School districts and is used heavily by the local colleges in the area. He became swamped at this time. Which led to Emily, Paul, and I spending a lot more time just the three of us.

Over the months of this we became a lot closer. Hello side hugs became lingering full front hugs. Emily and I would talk about all sorts of things. It kind of reminded me of when we were first dating. After a couple of months Kevin began joining us all again. This didn't dissuade Emily and I from rebuilding our friendship. Then the most amazing thing happened. Paul started calling me Dad. I literally teared up like the first 10 times he did this.

Life went on for the next couple of months. It was a week before the wedding. I was not going to attend, my parents were as guests only. That weekend they decided to have semi combined bachelor/bachelorette parties. Each was going out to dinner with friends, then friends activity (Her karaoke him Top Golf) then they'd all meet up at a bar or club around 11pm.

I wasn't involved in any of this and had no idea which place they were going to end at. I decided I was going out that night instead of just sitting in my apartment being a dud. It was a hard night for me as it was another reminder that I had lost her to someone else, no matter how good of a dude he was, I still hated it. It was around 1030 that night, I had a good buzz, and was planning on getting an Uber home when Emily and her bachelorette crew walked in. I kind of hid in the crowd at first, not wanting to butt into her night but she spotted me.

Emily came over and we began to talk. It was a little bit flirty. A song she loved came on and she began to dance, then dance on me. I joined in and we were laughing and having fun. As the song ended she kind of stumbled into me, I caught her and we looked at each other. Our lips moved in close and we almost kissed when she pulled back. We laughed it off and moved to the bar to get a drink. It was probably a good thing we didn't kiss because about 2 minutes later Kevin came walking up. He was trying to be his usual self but seemed a little off. They kissed, and I began to feel like the 3rd wheel so I went ahead and ordered that Uber and headed home.

The next day I'm a little hungover and slept in pretty heavy on my lazy Sunday. It was midday and I heard someone try to open my door. It was locked and they began knocking heavily. I ran over and opened the door. It was Emily, she lunged into my arms and kissed me. It was the sweetest feeling I have ever felt. Confusing, but sweet.

I asked her what was going on? She said, ""Kevin came to me this morning, and started asking some hard questions. I don't want to go into it, I promise I'll tell you everything one day, but I'm in no place to do so now. We decided to end things, I admitted my feelings were still strong for you, he said he understood, that it hurt but that he knew. He said we both deserve to be happy, and he is going to step away. I called your parents, they are good keeping Paul a bit longer. I love you and want to be with you, and I'm suspecting you feel the same way."" I told her that was all I ever wanted. It's been a whirlwind. She had two bags packed for her and Paul and they moved in with me that same day.

The next day my father went to visit Kevin. He told me Kevin looked a little hungover and had taken the day off. They had a talk and my Dad tried to be as empathetic as he could. He just wanted to check on him as Kevin had been a large part of their lives over the past few years. He asked Kevin what he was going to do. He said beyond trying to get some deposits back he had no idea. My father offered to refund him his money and take over the reservations. He didn't ask why, my father thinks he knew.

While this was going on I had to go into work and face Kyle. He called me into the office upon my arrival. Kyle had me sit and began, ""Just let me say my business. I'm angry, my brother tells me to let it go and I will. I want to take that anger out on you but I'm not going to, my brother and I learned the hard lesson back in High School when it comes to revenge and swore we'd always be the bigger men going forward, but that's not a tale for now. I think it's best we part ways, my family needs time to heal. I won't leave you high and dry though. You get one week paid off here, in that time I want you to speak to an acquaintance of mine Lee. Lee runs a construction company as well, and he says he will take you on at your current salary. It's commercial instead of residential but you'll do fine."" I stood up and started to thank him but he cut me off, ""This isn't for you, it's for Kev. Now go get your things and get up out of here."" I contacted Lee the same day. He told me I could start in 2 weeks.

Once my father came back and said he now had control of the wedding accommodations, Emily and I just looked at each other and knew we each wanted this. It wasn't the wedding we always wanted, we planned on getting married on a beach. It was Kevin that wanted the traditional wedding. In the end he was right though, we had an amazing time. Jorge was my best man. She looked stunning in her dress. Getting me a tux rental on short notice was probably the biggest headache but that worked out too. Neither of us had huge friend or family groups but it was nice to enjoy celebrating with those that had supported us through all these dark times.

It's been a month now since our wedding. I still can't believe it. Paul had a little trouble adjusting, he does miss Kevin, but he has seemed happier the last week. To be where I once was and be where I am now, I consider myself beyond lucky.

**Part 6-Kevin**

This is my first time ever posting. A friend of mine suggested this as a place to ""vent into the void."" I (Kevin 35M) was engaged to my amazing fianc√©e Emily (30F). We met at Starbucks almost 4 years ago now. I saw this mom struggling in the line, so I went up and just paid for her coffee and muffin. I really didn't have any expectations, but we started talking. I noticed she didn't have a ring on her finger, and decided I'd shoot my shot. I didn't want to be awkward so I just slipped her my business card with my cell on it and told her no pressure, figured if she was married she could just toss the card. I was ecstatic when she called me the next day.

Our relationship took off fast and I have to admit I was in love from the start. She had some trauma she had to deal with. I was the first relationship she had since her fianc√© had gone missing nearly 2 years earlier. I was sympathetic, I knew what it was like. I buried my first true love.

I had met a girl in college (Joselyn). We were together for 5 years, engaged, when she was taken from me in a car accident. It took me 2 full years to move on, and I'm still not 100%.

Emily wasn't my first date or relationship after losing Joselyn but she was the first that made me truly feel that spark. I met her son officially some months later. Paul was the sweetest boy, I bonded with him quickly. They moved in with me and I knew this is what I wanted out of life.

She was still struggling with the loss of her fianc√©. He had gone on a guys trip to Thailand and never came back. He had just disappeared and was presumed dead. I really put in the work to help her overcome that grief. I handled it when she cried after our first kiss because it was ""So different"". I took things slow while she came to terms with being intimate with someone new. Held her hand on the bad days, and celebrated the good. I knew what it was like, and I didn't want her to have to feel that way alone, like I made myself do.

We had been engaged about 2 months when everything started to go south. Her ex-fianc√© came back from the dead. He had been gone almost 5 years when his father, who Emily is still very close with and I had come to have a great relationship with came to our home. He told us that Walt was back, he was alive and well. He told us a story about being held captive by Cambodian drug smugglers. It seemed like a legit story, fantastical sure, but there was some evidence to back it all.¬†

I knew to be supportive at first. There was guilt there. I could understand that, they all gave up on finding him. They even had a memorial service. I was actually pretty relieved when Emily didn't want to meet him right away.

I remember when I first met Walt. There was something about him that just seemed off to me. I didn't say anything about that but did make the effort to let him know I wanted what was best for Emily and Paul, I even got the guy a job working for my brother Kyle. I didn't ever want to deny him his son, but I really needed him to understand that this was going to be hard on the people he left behind. We were plenty cordial with each other, but I will admit I played a bit overly nice, especially since I'm pretty sure he was cussing me under his breath.

Once they met in person it was the beginning of the end. My whole life I've been the bigger person, except for one time in High School. However, watching my fianc√©e have an emotional affair (EA) right in front of my face for the next 4 months was a bit much even for me. I know he was her son's father, but they got real close real quick. I would bring my feelings on this to her and she said it was just natural to them. That they had been together a long time before he was taken from her, but there was nothing romantic there anymore. She was with me now, not him. I bought the reassurances for far too long. At our bachelor/bachelorette party I saw them almost kiss. I knew then that the EA wouldn't end, and would at some point become a physical affair if I didn't do something.

I decided I had to take this head on the very next morning, we were 6 days from wedding bells. I asked her to talk to me. I asked, ""Are you falling back in love with Walt?""

She was taken aback for a moment,"" I never completely stopped, a part of me will always love him, we were separated through circumstances not by either of our own failings, but I've told you, there's nothing more between us.""

I pushed forward, ""I saw last night, I know you both thought I got there after, but I saw you dance, I saw you almost kiss. I just want to know if you want him more than you want me.""

She began to cry, ""No, I made a commitment to you, I will not go back on it. Sure there are still feelings, can you blame me, but I love you as well.""

I told her, ""That isn't very reassuring, it sounds more like you are staying with me out of obligation than love.""

She got defensive, ""I do love you, I'm marrying you.""

I calmly asked, ""When you picture yourself walking down that aisle, who do you picture standing at the end? ""

She was tearing up even heavier, ""I'm sorry, it's just hard now that he's back.""

I said, ""I know....I know what it is like to lose someone, I don't know how it feels to get them back. I'm sure it's hard""

Emily interrupted, ""It's impossible. I just can't stop how I feel. I'm so sorry.""

I hugged her tight, ""If you want to be with him, you need to tell me, it gets so much harder after next week. I only want you to be happy, with no regrets. Now, do you want to be with him or me?""

She sobbed harder. I broke down too, it was one of the most painful moments of my life. We talked about fairness, she wavered in her choice for a moment, but came back to him. I could sense a weight had come off of her. She began to pack. I asked if I could still be in Paul's life, she said that would make her so happy. In a last moment, before she walked out forever I told her I loved her and to take care of herself. I said, ""I know you don't want to hear this, but that place affected him far greater than he lets on, just promise me you will be careful."" She just nodded, turned and left. I completely fell apart.

I was left with the daunting task of telling my family, who all adored Emily, and getting back as much money as I could from the deposits. My brother was so angry, he wanted to fire him. I asked him not to, that this man would be providing for Paul now. He calmed, and said he would call Lee up and see if Lee could use him.

The next day the eldest Paul, my almost father in law came by. We had always had a good rapport. He came to make things right in a way, but I knew he also wanted to see his son marry Emily. When he offered to cover the return of all my deposits, I knew what he was doing. He was going to give them the chance to get married. I wanted to tell him to shove it, but I didn't. Always the bigger person, always letting it go.

She came and got the rest of her stuff that week and let me know they were marrying. All of this happened 9 months ago.

I've seen on their social media, they act like the happy couple. Everyone comments how happy they are for them. They say it was fate, that some divine force let him survive his ""imprisonment"" and come back to her. Then this week they announced that Emily was pregnant.

Very few people have reached out to me, especially from our mutual circle. It's like they forgot I'm a person too. I guess I was just supposed to be okay with everything because I didn't make a scene. I feel betrayed, I'm broken. My first ever girlfriend cheated, my second died, and now I Iost my fiancee to ""true love"". This house I live in used to be filled with hope for the future now it just has me wallowing in self pity. I was only able to see Paul twice this whole time, both of those in the first month. Then the separating me from their lives began. That's been the hardest part. I miss my little buddy. This was a boy who called me Dad, who sat on my lap every single night while I read him a story from his 5 minute Marvel books. He would fall asleep on me everyday and I would go lay him in his bed. You don't just turn that off, I miss him so much.

I just don't get it, how is this fair? I never cheated, I never raised my voice, I treated her with respect, care, love. And somehow I feel like I'm viewed as the ""Bad Guy"" in this story. How am I the one who deserves to be punished? I just wanted to raise Paul as my own, to love his mother and wake up to her everyday, to give them the best life I could. Where is the justice in this. Where? I don't expect anyone to feel sorry for me, we all have our losses. I just needed to get this off my chest.

Maybe just venting here, I have an appt with a gi dr next week but I‚Äôm so worried and I‚Äôm trying to take deep breaths and relax cause I know stress affects all these things too. 

I‚Äôve had pretty fine digestion my whole life. Occasional weird poos but nothing I‚Äôve ever worried about, just think ‚Äúoh I need more water or fiber or less coffee‚Äù you know normal bathroom thoughts. Usually 1-2 a day. For a while this year I was having like üëåüèº picture perfect üí©. Recently it started to become kinda piecey but I wasn‚Äôt too concerned. Last Sunday I looked and noticed brightish red colored poo and I convinced myself it was from tomatoes. Also at this time I was having some fridge issues and may have had some raw milk that got a little warm. No nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea but occasional feelings of ‚Äúoh shit I need to go to the bathroom‚Äù that often faded and just felt like gas ? Except usually didn‚Äôt become gas, just went away. In my lower belly. Some abdominal discomfort that would come and go, never too bad but noticeable. So I was hoping for a weird case of food poisoning ? My great grandma on moms side had colon cancer, my grandma on my dads side had diverticulitis. 
Monitored over the next few days, pooping a little more than usual (2-3 times a day) noticing maybe like a clear mucus on the poo, and very clumpy. Still bright red blood like streaked through or under the poo (once there were floating pieces). 
Tuesday decided to go to urgent care and then er. They did blood tests and a ct scan and said everything was normal and to follow up with gi doc so I am grateful to have my appt next week. After the ct scan I had pebble poop but I hadn‚Äôt eaten or drank much that day. It wasn‚Äôt hard through, I‚Äôm never straining or pushing real hard. Like twice in my life I‚Äôve had blood on tp after going to the bathroom. 

Yesterday I didn‚Äôt have any noticeable blood and poo was looking slightly more normal (still a few pieces)but today I had diarrhea with some blood (after drinking coffee ? That may have done too much to my belly). Not any abdominal discomfort yet though. 

I guess I just wanted to get this all out somewhere. Some family history of digestive issues. I‚Äôm 36/f and I know these things happen to people younger than me I just have a baby and dealt with melanoma on my arm last year (stage 1a, removed and no reason to think it‚Äôs spread but this all has me anxious af) and really I just want to be healthy. 

I know I‚Äôm a worrier and that can affect digestion. I‚Äôm hoping the dr can give me answers. If you read all this thank you for listening to me cry and talk about my poop. ",2,1744995928.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

1k29y9o,https://i.redd.it/y4ebw92fkmve1.jpeg,1 Week Out: Who Are Your Top 3 Dream Picks for the Seahawks at #18?,"
Yes, I‚Äôm just a random nobody on Reddit but I live and breathe football. It‚Äôs just a hobby, but I enjoy diving into all of it: film, stats, combine testing, scheme fits, you name it. I enjoy listening to NFL analyst, local reporters, podcasts and ex NFL players such as, Daniel Jeremiah, Brock Huard, hawkblogger, Jim Nagy, Steve Smith Jr, Rob Staton,  Brendon Nelson.

Last year, I was all-in on Cooper DeJean, Troy Fautanu, and Jared Verse and all three looked like great picks early. DeJean‚Äôs versatility, instincts and great tackling are already making a difference. Verse  looks like a cornerstone edge for the Rams and has the tools to be a longtime disruptor. Fautanu was showing real promise before his injury. (You can check that post here).  -
 https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/s/NkO7pMzGRQ


So with that said, here are my top picks for the Seahawks at #18 in this year‚Äôs draft, just my opinion, but built on hours of research and way too many cups of coffee.


---

If Seahawks Stick to BPA at #18 These Are My Picks



üîπJihaad Campbell (LB, Alabama) ‚Äì My #1 pick for Seattle. Explosive, fast, and instinctive. Campbell flies around the field and has the versatility to cover tight ends, chase sideline to sideline, and rush from the edge. At 6""3, 240lbs, he has true potential and the athleticism to thrive in any front. In a Mike Macdonald defense that thrives on disguise, pressure, and mobility, Campbell would be a seamless fit and day 1 impact.

üîπ Nick Emmanwori (S, South Carolina) ‚Äì The film doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúelite,‚Äù but the traits are there. Long frame, physical tackler, solid in coverage, and incredibly fast, running a 4.38 @ 6""3, 220lbs. In Mike Macdonald‚Äôs system, I think he has the ceiling to become elite. He‚Äôs a future enforcer with positional flexibility.

üîπ Mykel Williams (EDGE, Georgia) ‚Äì Built like a tank with the explosiveness to match. Williams is only 20 years old, 6‚Äô5‚Äù, 265-lb edge rusher with long arms, heavy hands, and true three-down ability. He can rush from both inside and outside, set the edge against the run, and has flashed game-wrecking potential since his freshman year at Georgia. He fits the mold of a versatile, scheme-diverse pass rusher  and would thrive in a Mike Macdonald system that values length, power and versatility.


I do understand all these players could be picked before the Seahawks are on the clock  but it‚Äôs entirely possible one of them slips to 18.

Also, let‚Äôs be real, from pick 12 to pick 60, the talent feels pretty even, especially along the offensive and defensive lines. That‚Äôs why BPA really matters this year. The margins are thin, and a good fit could outweigh ‚Äúbig board‚Äù rankings.

---

Rounds 2 and 3 Are LOADED With Value

I might be even more hyped for rounds 2 and 3 than round 1. This class is deep, and Seattle could walk away with serious impact players on Day 2 with the 4 picks we have in the TOP 100.

Here are some names I‚Äôve got circled as high-value picks in the mid rounds:

Mason Taylor (TE, LSU) ‚Äì Smooth route runner with NFL bloodlines and underrated toughness in the run game.

Tyliek Williams (DT, Ohio State) ‚Äì Big, disruptive interior presence. Can eat space and collapse the pocket.

Bradyn Swinson (EDGE, LSU) ‚Äì Explosive get-off and bend. High-upside pass rusher with room to grow.

Josaiah Stewart (EDGE, Michigan) ‚Äì Undersized but relentless. Quick hands, plays bigger than his frame.

Tate Ratledge (G, Georgia) ‚Äì A tone-setter up front. Smart, tough, and built for interior dominance.

Maxwell Hairston (CB, Kentucky) ‚Äì Ballhawk with sticky coverage traits. Tracks the ball well, physical at the catch point, and has the length Seattle loves in its corners.

Que Robinson (EDGE, Alabama) ‚Äì Powerful and twitchy off the edge. Still raw, but flashes big-time burst and flexibility. Could thrive in a rotational role and develop into a high-end starter.


I don't think this is a great draft for QBs, WRs, or centers. Some of the wide receivers being talked about as late-first or early-second rounders this year would have been solidly day-two picks in last year‚Äôs class. There‚Äôs talent, but not as much top-end difference makers at those spots especially compared to 2024.

He seemed cool and interesting, so I agreed. He responded ‚ÄúOK, I‚Äôll look for some places and get back to you!‚Äù 

I never heard from him again. Since then I got into a long-term relationship, got engaged and subsequently broke up and have been dating on and off.

Cut to 15 years later, I‚Äôm checking my LinkedIn box (in late March), and see a message from him (notably, sent at 1:30 am). ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm not sure if you remember me‚Ä¶ wanted to see how you were doing, I‚Äôd love to catch up sometime!‚Äù

Surprised, I responded (edit: within a day of receiving the message, I get notifications from Linkedin)  not with the snarky comeback that I was thinking in my head (I mean, clearly, he must‚Äôve spent the last several years looking for the perfect coffee spot). 

Never heard back. I only recently learned there‚Äôs a name for this kind of behavior, zombie-ing? It‚Äôs bizarre. Anyone else experience someone from their past trying to shoot their shot on LinkedIn?

**Part 1**

Five years ago I (Walt 28M) made a choice that royaly fucked up my life. I had a lot going for me. At the time I was the new guy at my firm. I was an architect (Mostly subdivisions) and really enjoying it. I had a long term girlfriend of 3 years (Emily 29F now, 24 then), that I had recently become engaged to. I really thought nothing could derail me.

After Emily said yes, we began to plan the wedding. We were not up for the big wedding thing. We agreed we would have an elopement to a coastal city (San Diego became the plan) parents/siblings were welcome to come if they wanted, but basically we were just booking a honeymoon and getting married while we were there.

Since this whole trip was going to be, relatively speaking, inexpensive. We decided to splurge on pre wedding activities. Now, neither of us wanted traditional Bachelor/Bachelorette parties. We agreed we would scratch off ""bucket list items."" Emily wanted to swim with sharks, and booked herself one of those cage dive excursions. Her and her best friend Maggie went to Florida for a long weekend and did just that. Mine was quite a bit more. I had always wanted to visit Thailand. It was one of those dumb things I got fascinated with as a 10 year old and swore I was going to go.

Emily actually encouraged me, pointing out that I literally brought up Thailand on our first date. We were 6 months into our engagement when the time came for me and my best friend (Jorge) to leave on the trip. For the first 3 days everything was great. We were enjoying beaches, visiting temples, and drinking a lot. On that 3rd night though Jorge got absolutely smashed drunk. I was a little pissed about this and tried to slow him down. The next day we were supposed to go on a jungle excursion. It was one of the things I was most looking forward to so I had been pacing myself so I could enjoy the trek.

The next morning Jorge has a world class hangover, refused to get up at all, and says we can book an excursion tomorrow. My thought was , ""fuck that"" I'm going today. I had seen ads for a few places that did these. I went out to get some breakfast and spotted a guy on the side of the road offering the Jungle excursion cheap. He had a Jeep and when he noticed me looking at his sign, moved in with the hard sell. Honestly it did look a little shady, but the guy spoke English so well it gave me a false sense of security. I decided to go with this guy.

I get in and for a while it's actually pretty fun. He pulls off the main road on these off road paths. I have no idea where we are going. We end up deep down these roads. I'm enjoying it for the most part though. Then everything went sideways.

We stopped in this small clearing, and I was checking some things out, when out of nowhere local law enforcement pulls up. I don't know what's being said, I can only pick out a word here and a word there. They start going through the guys Jeep and find a rather large quantity of methamphetamine. I am shitting a brick at this point. These cops take us both in to their small, middle of nowhere station. This is when I come to realization that this Mother Fucker has taken me into Cambodia. I don't have my ID or passport on me, they are back in the room. These cops are not listening to anything and I have no idea what my guide is telling them.

I was freaking out but also thought, it'll be okay, Jorge will realize I'm gone, look into where I am. I'm not going to go into what the next 4 and a half years were like but Hell is an easy comparison. I'll just leave it at a Cambodian jail isn't the most hospitable environment. It took 5 months of sitting in that cell before I even saw a judge. The judicial system there is so back logged, and the few public defenders that exist are basically in the large cities only. During this whole time I was never allowed to contact anyone on the outside. My first time in front the judge they didn't have an interpreter and it got postponed another 5 months. I finally had that pre-trial hearing, entered a plea, then it was another 14 months before my actual hearing. When I finally had my hearing, the judge was very fair and dismissed my charges on time served, only for the prosecutor to appeal the dismissal. This put me back into custody for another 28 months. This was the most devastating moment of my life, to think I was out and end up still in for that long.

During this time, after no one came for me, I realized they all thought I was dead. I had gone missing. Jorge had no idea where I was, I had called back home the morning I was arrested and left messages, but they only knew I was going on a jungle excursion. My parents, my fiancee, I missed them so much. There were plenty of days I was hoping one of the other inmates or a rough guard would just take me out already, especially after the first year when I became more tolerant of the food and water.

Finally after 52 months in captivity I was released. I had nothing to my name and was in a country I wasn't supposed to be in. I contacted the embassy, and they did have a missing persons file for me. They helped me contact home. I attempted to contact my Fiancee but a guy named Mitch answered and he did not know an Emily, so I figured she must have changed her number at some point. I called my mother.

She was absolutely frantic. She grabbed my father and I told her my entire tale. I kept asking about Emily and my mother kept deflecting. She wanted to get started immediately getting me home, and said we would talk about everything when I got back to the US. It took a little while to make this happen, my parents luckily had my original passport and ID, which made the process somewhat faster. During that time they sent me money and I was able to get a hotel. My parents were very very adamant I not try to contact Emily during this time and to wait until we got back.

I obviously started to assume she had moved on and was with someone else. Which was heartbreaking. I had held out hope during my imprisonment that she would not, but with the way my parents were acting I assumed that was the case.

Even so I wanted to contact her immediately, before anything else. I didn't want to talk about my time there, I didn't want to talk about what they did trying to find me, or know anything about anyone else. I just wanted my fiancee.

My parents sat me down and handed me a save the date card. It was Emily and some tall handsome guy I'd never seen before. She was engaged. I broke down, it wasn't unexpected, but the feelings were still there. I asked my parents if they had kept in touch with her beyond just being wedding guest worthy. They said yes, they've actually been a huge part of each other's lives these last few years.

I was a little shocked, I know they liked Emily, but with me gone I had somewhat expected them to drift apart not get closer.

I decided to ask, ""So how close are you guys now?"" My mother responded, ""Very, her father passed a year ago and your Dad has agreed to walk her down the aisle."" That hurt, it shouldn't, but it did.

""Why you?"" Was all I could say. My mom got emotional, started going on about how they all thought I was gone, that a cartel or something got me, that they looked so hard and so long. They had a whole memorial service for me. I snapped a little, ""I don't care about that right now, what are you not telling me.""

My mother took that tablet and flipped a few photos. She then handed it back to me. There was a whole group photo. My parents, Emily, her fiance, her mom, my sister, my brother, Emily's brother, Jorge, other friends and kids. But at the center of the table was a boy sitting behind a birthday cake. The decorations read ""Happy 4th Birthday"" He was smiling big. I just looked at my parents.

My mother looked at me and said, ""That's your son, Paul (my dad's name) Walter (My name) Ryne (Our last name).""

**Part 2**

In the two weeks since I got back home it simultaneously feels like so much has happened, and that virtually nothing has happened. I have been largely brought up to speed on all that has happened on this side of the world.

When Jorge finally got up out of bed that day 5 years ago he tried to call me. After having no success (the officers confiscated my phone immediately upon arrest, I never saw it again). He decided to just go about his day, assuming I was enjoying my excursion. It wasn't until it was well past dark that he started to get concerned. He called back home to see if anyone else had heard from me. The next morning my family and fiancee were blowing up his phone wondering if I had come back yet. That's when he began venturing out to all the excursion places. They all reported that they had not seen me. He began to panic and alerted everyone back home. He went to the authorities at this point. My parents, brother and fiancee all made the trip to join him. They spent a month canvasing the area before they had to go back. My parents made another trip to Thailand to try and find me, but again turned up nothing. Over the next year and half they were a constant reminder to the Thai officials of my disappearance, unfortunately, no one thought to look in Cambodia.

Meanwhile, my fiancee Emily came to the realization she was pregnant. On the day I left for Thailand, she was unknowingly around 10 weeks. I can only imagine how hard it was on her. I'm missing, she's pregnant with my child. I wish I had never gone.

My parents told me Emily really leaned on them, and they were happy to help. Over the years they've just grown closer and closer. Her parents were there, and supportive, but they are much older than mine and not in as good of health. My mom ended up taking Emily to a lot of her OB appointments. She was there in the delivery room along with Emily's mom. It was apparently very stressful as Paul was born at just 34 weeks. Luckily he showed no signs of health problems and they just kept him under heightened observation initially.

My parents told me they needed this. The anguish of not knowing what happened to me was very hard, and the birth of their grandson provided a much needed respite from the grief. They keep telling me how sorry they are, but they didn't do anything wrong. I guess it's just guilt now that they know I was out there, and they ""failed"" to find me.

Jorge has been by to see me. He has apologized far too many times. He's gotten married since the trip, and has two kids now. He seems nervous around me, and I guess that's fair, I do hold some resentment towards him. It's not his fault, but the feeling is there anyway.

My brother and sister have marched on with life. My brother has kids now, and my sister is married. I missed all of this. I could probably get over all of that, but losing my fiancee and missing out on 4 years with my son, it's been too much.

My parents have set me up with a therapist. I went to the first session but have no idea what to talk about. I was wrongfully incarcerated for 5 years, beaten at times, starved at times. Plenty of PTSD. My whole family thought I was dead, so much so they had a memorial service for me 3 years to the day of my disappearance. I was supposed to marry the love of my life, and she is now engaged to someone else. Then to top it all off, I have a 4 year old son, who has been raised by ""my replacement"" since he was 18 months old. Paul only knows this guy as Dad, he calls him Dad, and now here I am, back from the dead to fuck up everyone else's perfect little lives.

I'm ranting though. It's just too much to unpack. I still haven't directly spoken to Emily. My father went to her house the day after my return. He sat her and her fiance (Kevin 34M) down, told them I had been found. She began to tear up, she thought he was saying my body had been recovered. When he corrected her, she had a complete breakdown. Her fiance comforted her, my Dad said she was just silent afterwards.

I tried texting her, I got no response for a whole day, then just a ""I'm so sorry, I just can't right now."" I haven't asked anyone about her fiance, other than I know she's been engaged for about 2 months, and the wedding is supposed to be in 6. No one has volunteered any information at this point.

We are supposed to all meet at the park this weekend. My resurgence has thrown the harmony out of whack and I can tell everyone is a little off. My mother typically watches Paul while Emily and Kevin are at work. A lot of time it's at her house, but since I showed up it's been exclusively over at Emily's. I hear they are prepping him to meet me. He is aware I'm his father. My pictures are all over at my parents house. Emily has apparently always had a picture of me up in Paul's room. I'm a shell of the guy in the picture, but I guess at least I kinda look like that still. He won't be totally blind sided.

**Part 3**

My parents and I arrived at the park first. When we saw their car pull up. Only Kevin and Paul got out. Emily was not with them. Paul ran up to my Dad first and gave him a big hug. He saw me and kind of retreated to my Mom, then over to Kevin. I could tell he was nervous, I mean shit, so was I and I'm not 4 years old. The other adults tried to say something to get us to talk or embrace or something. I told them to let it go, let him go play. He perked up and ran off to the playground.

Kevin came up and stuck his hand out. We shook, and he said, ""Sorry, Emily, couldn't today. We were about out the door and she broke down, told me she wasn't ready."" I just said, ""I understand.""

I went over to the playground to try and bond in some way. Turns out Paul is big into super heroes. He pretended to be Spider-Man and I had to be Rhino. I chased him all over the playground, and let his ""web me up."" He laughed and smiled. When the food was ready I was happy to see he liked his hotdogs the same as me. Ketchup on one side, mustard on the other, relish on top. I thought maybe this won't be so hard. Then he called Kevin ""Dad"".

I shouldn't have been surprised by this, he's been in this kid's life for 2.5 years, he is marrying his mom, they all live in the same house. That all said, it was like a knife in the heart, I began to actually tear up. I excused myself for a moment, and said I was going over to the gross park bathroom. When I came out after a minute Kevin was waiting.

I could see my parents across the way watching Paul. I felt instantly awkward, the last thing I wanted right now was a heart to heart with Kevin. He was taller than me, more built than me, and had gotten to have the life I was supposed to have. He just said, ""Can we talk?"" I said, ""Yeah, man, what's on your mind?""

Kevin began, ""Look, I'm sorry for what happened to you, it's a bad deal all around. I just wanted to talk because I'm worried about Emily and Paul. Emily more than him. She hasn't been herself, which I can appreciate to some degree, it took a long time for her to get over you. I'm the first person she dated after your incident. She cried the first time we kissed because ""it was different"". I want you to have a relationship with your son, he's little, he's resilient. I had two Dads growing up, I know he will be fine. I don't know how fine her or you will be if this goes too fast, and from a selfish standpoint I don't want anything disrupting our life or our engagement. I love her, and want what's best. I'd like you two to take it slow and process everything before you meet. I made an appointment for her to see a counselor. I'd appreciate it if you could respect that and not push her or reach out to her. Let her figure things out on her own first.""

I was pissed listening to him, pretentious ass, but fuck he had some points. I don't want to rip open all these old wounds. I ended up just saying, ""Yeah man, I can do that."" And walked off to join my parents and Paul. Kevin went into the gross bathroom. When he came back over he said him and Paul were going to head out. Paul gave everyone hugs, including me, I was surprised, but pleasantly. Then he called me Rhino, and ran off to Kevin. As they left I heard him say, ""Dad can we get a Cookie Cake on the way home?""

Ugh, He's Dad, I'm Rhino, and this just fucking sucks.

**Part 4**

We finally met. We started by texting a bit, but it felt so impersonal the conversations stayed at a surface level. The deepest we really got was talking about Paul and me briefly divulging what Cambodian prison was like.

Over the 3 weeks between our first text exchange and our meet up we only texted maybe 5 times, and each time it started to get into heavy subjects one of us would end the conversation.

During that time though I did spend more time with Paul. My mother began watching him at her house again and that gave us time to bond. I even had some one on one time with him when we went to get ice cream together one day. It's amazing how resilient kids are, he just goes with the flow of everything. He still calls me Rhino, but maybe I'll get the ""Dad"" title soon....

One day this past week, when Kevin came by to pick up Paul, he asked to talk again. This time he had a job offer for me, which had me getting pissed. Then he elaborated that it wasn't really an offer but more of a lead. His brother owns a construction company and is looking for an estimator. Kevin told his brother I was once an architect and his brother said he'd give me an interview if I was interested. He left his brother's card with me. I really want to hate Kevin, but he does actually seem to be a genuinely nice person, which also pisses me off. His self-depricating sense of humor grows on you fast, and this is just in 5-10 minute interactions with him. But at the same time, ""Fuck that Guy.""

I talked to Emily via text this past Friday. We agreed to meet the next day for lunch. I suggested this Italian place that had been ""our"" place, but she got a little upset about this and I thought she was going to cancel. Instead we pivoted to Applebee's.

Seeing her in person I can't even describe. She was just as beautiful as ever. The hello hug caused a shiver through my spine, I didn't want to let go, and may have lingered for just a second, but also didn't want to make it weird. We exchanged pleasantries and small talk through the ordering, and at that point the conversation took the first serious turn since my return, and it stayed that way for the next hour as we talked.

She told me how hard it was to deal with ""my death."" She was pregnant and grieving, and a lot of days didn't want to carry on. It hurts so bad to listen to what she was going through. She told me she felt so alone anytime she was in our apartment that she spent most nights staying at her parents or mine. She kept hoping that everytime the phone rang it would be someone with news about me, and then began to hope it wasn't, because as time went on it became more likely that it would be a call that they found my body. She told me about how great my parents, and to a lesser degree my siblings had been to her. My SIL and her even had slightly overlapping pregnancies so it was fun to have someone to talk to about it.

It was after Paul's first birthday, that my parents of all people, talked to her about ""getting back out there."" She admitted she was really only spending time with her parents, my parents, or my SIL and by extension my brother. She said she even fell off hanging out with her best friend. Emily told me it was fear. She never wanted to be away from Paul, if I could disappear in an instant, then that means anyone could. She wouldnt be able to live without him. After this intervention, she realized she was living like a widow and not a 25 year old woman. She began hanging out with her friends again, let others watch Paul occasionally so she could go out.

It was 2 months into her attempts at living life that she ran into Kevin. They were in a Starbucks, she was fumbling trying to get her phone out while holding Paul. When suddenly this tall handsome fucker (my words) comes up and scans his phone, buying her coffee and muffin. They strike up a conversation while waiting. When her order gets called, he grabs it and hands it to her along with a business card with his cell number on it (Kevin owns a screen printing shop). Tells her, ""No pressure, but I'd like to get to know you better."" Then they part ways. She called him the next day. 4 months later she introduced Paul to him. A year later they moved in with him and a few months ago they got engaged.

This is where I said my piece. I told her I still loved her, that it's impossibly hard to see her with someone else. The idea of getting back to her was one of the few things that kept me going when I was locked away. She began to cry, and I reached out and took her hand. I asked if she was sure, or if there was anyway we could try again (In hindsight I feel like this was a dick move, but at the time I needed to know.)

She shook her head. Looked up at me and said, ""I love you, I never stopped, but I love Kevin too, and I'm marrying him. It's not fair, I know it's not fair, you didn't do anything wrong, but I had to move on. I spent years thinking you had died. When you came back I was so happy, but also so guilty."" I cut her off there, ""You have nothing to feel guilty about, I fucked up and cost myself everything. I always knew you'd likely moved on, and I don't fault you for that, I was gone, there was no reason for you to believe I was coming back, but I did dream that I'd find my way back and you'd be there when I returned. I realize that was unrealistic. I'm sorry for putting you in this position now."" She said, ""It's okay, I knew this was coming eventually.""

We just kind of stopped talking at that point. Sat there just drinking our drinks. After a few minutes that seemed like eternity, she said, ""How do you want to move forward when it comes to Paul?"" I told her, ""I love him already and want to be in his life."" She replied, ""I'm so happy for that, I always told him about you, I didn't want him to think he was abandoned."" I said, ""He is the one bright spot in this whole situation.""

From there she told me that Kevin had planned to adopt him once they were married but wouldn't now that I have returned. I am listed on the birth certificate as the father, although I think I'll meet with a lawyer just to make sure everything is in place from a legal standpoint.

We made some plans to meet together later in the week with Paul. Let him have fun with all of his parents at the same time. She also encouraged me to do more one on ones with him.

At the end we hugged one more time and parted ways. When I got back to my parents house and in my room, I broke down. The finality of it all was just too much. After I recovered I decided I was not going to wallow in my grief anymore. I needed to swallow some pride, and get on track to do something with myself. The next day I called Kevin's brother and did an interview that day. He hired me. This is the first step towards moving on.

**Part 5**

Holy shit, you are not gonna believe what I'm about to tell you. These last 6 months have been nothing short of absolutely fucking crazy, but in a good way.

After my first initial face to face with Emily, I decided I needed to move on with my life, and I ended up getting hired to be an estimator for Kevin's brother Kyle's (36M) construction company. It was going well and at about the 2 month mark Kyle, knowing I was an architect, started asking me to design some of his custom builds and would compare them to the usual architect he was using. He was liking mine better, and while I still work as an estimator still, I am now solely designing the custom homes for Kyle and he gave me a huge raise. This allowed me to get my own apartment and I'm thankful to say I am no longer living in my parents house.

Emily and Kevin's wedding plans progressed with only one major change. My father was no longer walking her down the aisle, as everyone felt it was inappropriate given my return. Her much much older brother was going to take that role now (Emily was an oops baby, so her brother is 16 years older than her).

After our initial lunch, I saw Emily a lot more often. We were making it a point to do something all together with Paul at least once a week. Kevin was there as well, but they kept the ""couple"" behavior to a minimum. It was fun. I especially enjoyed getting to talk to Emily and just be around her. After a month of this back to school season hit. I guess in the screen printing industry this is the busy season. Which I guess makes sense with fall sports, staff shirts, clubs, Greek life. Kevin has contracts with all the School districts and is used heavily by the local colleges in the area. He became swamped at this time. Which led to Emily, Paul, and I spending a lot more time just the three of us.

Over the months of this we became a lot closer. Hello side hugs became lingering full front hugs. Emily and I would talk about all sorts of things. It kind of reminded of me when we were first dating. After a couple of months Kevin began joining us all again. This didn't dissuade Emily and I from rebuilding our friendship. And then the most amazing thing happened. Paul started calling me Dad. I literally teared up like the first 10 times he did this.

Life went on for the next couple of months. It was a week before the wedding. I was not going to attend, my parents were as guests only. That weekend they decided to have semi combined bachelor/bachelorette parties. Each was going out to dinner with friends, then friends activity (Her karaoke him Top Golf) then they'd all meet up at a bar or club around 11pm.

I wasn't involved in any of this and had no idea which place they were going to end at. I decided I was going out that night instead of just sitting in my apartment being a dud. It was a hard night for me as it was another reminder that I had lost her to someone else, no matter how good of a dude he was, I still hated it. It was around 1030 that night, I had a good buzz, and was planning on getting an Uber home when Emily and her bachelorette crew walked in. I kind of hid in the crowd at first, not wanting to butt into her night but she spotted me.

Emily came over and we began to talk. It was a little bit flirty. A song she loved came on and she began to dance, then dance on me. I joined in and we were laughing and having fun. As the song ended she kind of stumbled into me, I caught her and we looked at each other. Our lips moved in close and we almost kissed when she pulled back. We laughed it off and moved to the bar to get a drink. It was probably a good thing we didn't kiss because about 2 minutes later Kevin came walking up. He was trying to be his usual self but seemed a little off. They kissed, and I began to feel like the 3rd wheel so I went ahead and ordered that Uber and headed home.

The next day I'm a little hungover and slept in pretty heavy on my lazy Sunday. It was midday and I hear someone try and open my door. It was locked and they began knocking heavily. I ran over and opened the door. It was Emily, she lunged into my arms and kissed me. It was the sweetest feeling I have ever felt. Confusing, but sweet.

I asked her what was going on? She said, ""Kevin came to me this morning, and started asking some hard questions. I don't want to go into it, I promise I'll tell you everything one day, but I'm in no place to do so now. We decided to end things, I admitted my feelings were still strong for you, he said he understood, that it hurt but that he knew. He said we both deserve to be happy, and he is going to step away. I called your parents, they are good keeping Paul a bit longer. I love you and want to be with you, and I'm suspecting you feel the same way."" I told her that was all I ever wanted. It's been a whirlwind. She had two bags packed for her and Paul and they moved in with me that same day.

The next day my father went to visit Kevin. He told me Kevin looked a little hungover and had taken the day off. They had a talk and my Dad tried to be as empathetic as he could. He just wanted to check on him as Kevin had been a large part of their lives over the past few years. He asked Kevin what he was going to do. He said beyond trying to get some deposits back he had no idea. My father offered to refund him his money and take over the reservations. He didn't ask why, my father thinks he knew.

While this was going on I had to go into work and face Kyle. He called me into the office upon my arrival. Kyle had me sit and began, ""Just let me say my business. I'm angry, my brother tells me to let it go and I will. I want to take that anger out on you but I'm not going to, my brother and I learned the hard lesson back in High School when it comes to revenge and swore we'd always be the bigger men going forward, but that's not a tale for now. I think it's best we part ways, my family needs time to heal. I won't leave you high and dry though. You get one week paid off here, in that time I want you to speak to an acquaintance of mine Lee. Lee runs a construction company as well, and he says he will take you on at your current salary. It's commercial instead of residential but you'll do fine."" I stood up and started to thank him but he cut me off, ""This isn't for you, it's for Kev. Now go get your things and get up out of here."" I contacted Lee the same day. He told me I could start in 2 weeks.

Once my father came back and said he now had control of the wedding accommodations, Emily and I just looked at each other and knew we each wanted this. It wasn't the wedding we always wanted, we planned on getting married on a beach. It was Kevin that wanted the traditional wedding. In the end he was right though, we had an amazing time. Jorge was my best man. She looked stunning in her dress. Getting me a tux rental on short notice was probably the biggest headache but that worked out too. Neither of us had huge friend or family groups but it was nice to enjoy celebrating with those that had supported us through all these dark times.

It's been a month now since our wedding. I still can't believe it. Paul had a little trouble adjusting, he does miss Kevin, but he has seemed happier the last week. To be where I once was and be where I am now, I consider myself beyond lucky.

# I was engaged, then her ex-fiance came back from the ""dead"". Now I'm alone and so tired of being the bigger person.¬†¬†

This is my first time ever posting. A friend of mine suggested this as a place to ""vent into the void."" I (Kevin 35M) was engaged to my amazing fiancee Emily (30F). We met at Starbucks almost 4 years ago now. I saw this mom struggling in the line, so I went up and just paid for her coffee and muffin. I really didn't have any expectations, but we started talking. I noticed she didn't have a ring on her finger, and decided I'd shoot my shot. I didn't want to be awkward so I just slipped her my business card with my cell on it and told her no pressure, figured if she was married she could just toss the card. I was ecstatic when she called me the next day.

Our relationship took off fast and I have to admit I was in love from the start. She had some trauma she had to deal with. It was the first relationship she had since her fiance had gone missing nearly 2 years earlier. I was sympathetic, I knew what it was like. I buried my first true love.

I met a girl in college (Joselyn). We were together for 5 years, engaged, when she was taken from me in a car accident. It took me 2 full years to move on, and I'm still not 100%.

Emily wasn't my first date after losing Joselyn but she was the first that made me feel that spark. I met her son officially some months later. Paul was the sweetest boy, I bonded with him quickly. They moved in with me and I knew this is what I wanted out of life.

She was still struggling with the loss of her fiance. He had gone on a guys trip to Thailand and never came back. He had just disappeared and was presumed dead. I really put in the work to help her overcome that grief. I handled it when she cried after our first kiss because it was ""So different"". I took things slow while she came to terms with being intimate with someone new. Held her hand on the bad days, and celebrated the good. I knew what it was like, and I didn't want her to have to feel that way alone, like I made myself do.

We had been engaged about 2 months when everything started to go south. Her ex-fiance came back from the dead. He had been gone almost 5 years when his father, who Emily is still very close with and I had come to have a great relationship with came to our home. He told us that Walt was back, he was alive and well. He told us a story about being trapped in a Cambodian Prison. Which if I'm being honest still doesn't make any sense. Like you were just lost in the shuffle? They never once let you make a phone call? Maybe in 1979 but not in 2019. I brought this up to Emily once and she didn't want to hear it.

I knew to be supportive at first. There was guilt there. I could understand that, they all gave up on finding him. They even had a memorial service. I was actually pretty relieved when Emily didn't want to meet him right away.

I remember when I first met Walt. There was something about him that just seemed off to me. I didn't say anything about that but did make the effort to let him know I wanted what was best for Emily and Paul, I even got the guy a job working for my brother Kyle. I didn't ever want to deny him his son, but I really needed him to understand that this was going to be hard on the people he left behind. We were plenty cordial with each other, but I will admit I played a bit overly nice, especially since I'm pretty sure he was cussing me under his breath.

Once they met in person it was the beginning of the end. My whole life I've been the bigger person, except for one time in High School. However watching my fiancee have an emotional affair (EA) right in front of my face for the next 4 months was a bit much even for me. I know he was her son's father, but they got real close real quick. I would bring my feelings on this to her and she said it was just natural to them. That they had been together a long time before he was taken from her, but there was nothing romantic there anymore. She was with me now not him. I bought the reassurances for far too long. At our bachelor/bachelorette party I saw them almost kiss. I knew then that the EA wouldn't end, and would at some point become a physical affair if I didn't do something.

I decided I had to take this head on the very next morning, we were 6 days from wedding bells. I asked her to talk to me. I asked, ""Are you falling back in love with Walt?""

She was taken aback for a moment,"" I never completely stopped, a part of me will ways love him, we were separated through circumstances not by either of our own failings, but I've told you, there's nothing more between us.""

I pushed forward, ""I saw last night, I know you both thought I got there after, but I saw you dance, I saw you almost kiss. I just want to know if you want him more than you want me.""

She began to cry, ""No, I made a commitment to you, I will not go back on it. Sure there are still feelings, can you blame me, but I love you as well.""

I told her, ""That isn't very reassuring, it sounds more like you are staying with me out of obligation than love.""

She got defensive, ""I do love you, I'm marrying you.""

I calmly asked, ""When you picture yourself walking down that aisle, who do you picture standing at the end. ""

She was tearing up even heavier, ""I'm sorry, it's just hard now that he's back.""

I said, ""I know....I know what it is like to lose someone, I don't know how it feels to get them back. I'm sure it's hard""

Emily interrupted, ""It's impossible. I just can't stop how I feel. I'm so sorry.""

I hugged her tight, ""If you want to be with him, you need to tell me, it gets so much harder after next week. I only want you to be happy, with no regrets. Now, do you want to be with him?""

She just nodded her head and sobbed harder. I broke down too, it was one of the most painful moments of my life. We talked on about fairness, she wavered in her choice for a moment, but came back to him. I could sense a weight had come off of her. She began to pack. I asked if I could still be in Paul's life, she said that would make her so happy. In a last moment, before she walked out forever I told her I loved her and to take care of herself. I said, ""I know you don't want to hear this, but that prison story has never sat right with me, just promise me you will be careful."" She just nodded, turned and left. I completely fell apart.

I was left with the daunting task of telling my family, who all adored Emily, and getting back as much money as I could from the deposits. My brother was so angry, he wanted to fire him. I asked him not to, that this man would be providing for Paul now. He calmed, and said he would call Lee up and see if Lee could use him.

The next day the eldest Paul, my almost father in law came by. We had always had a good rapport. He came to make things right in a way, but I knew he also wanted to see his son marry Emily. When he offered to cover the return of all my deposits, I knew what he was doing. He was going to give them the chance to get married. I wanted to tell him to shove it, but I didn't. Always the bigger person, always letting it go.

She came and got the rest of her stuff that week and let me know they were marrying. All of this happened 9 months ago.

I've seen on their social media that they act like the happy couple. Everyone comments how happy they are for them. They say it was fate, that some divine force let him survive his ""imprisonment"" and come back to her. Then this week they announced that Emily was pregnant.

Very few people have reached out to me, especially from our mutual circle. It's like they forgot I'm a person too. I guess I was just supposed to be okay with everything because I didn't make a scene. I feel betrayed, I'm broken. My first ever girlfriend cheated, my second died, and now I Iost my fiancee to ""true love"". This house I live in used to be filled with hope for the future now it just has me wallowing in self pity. I was only able to see Paul twice this whole time, both of those in the first month. Then the separating me from there loves began. That's been the hardest part. I miss my little buddy. This was a boy who called me Dad, who sat on my lap every single night while I read him a story from his 5 minute Marvel books. He would fall asleep on me everyday and I would go lay him in his bed. You don't just turn that off, I miss him so much.

I just don't get it, how is this fair? I never cheated, I never raised my voice, I treated her with respect, care, love. And somehow I feel like I'm viewed as the ""Bad Guy"" in this story? How am I the one who deserves to be punished? I just wanted to raise Paul as my own, to love his mother and wake up to her everyday, to give them the best life I could. Where is the justice in this. Where? I don't expect anyone to feel sorry for me, we all have our losses. I just needed to get this off my chest.

I live on the third floor of my apartment and the Adrenaline from moving up and down and having to get the bags really got to me. I was trying to put everything away and then I thought I felt pre syncope. I had to take a break from the groceries and I lied on my bedroom floor. I just didn‚Äôt feel good and I got so scared.

I called the nurses line because I felt so uncomfortable with myself and she asked me questions and had me take my blood pressure on my cuff and the talking helped.

Now I‚Äôm laying in bed and I still just feel so jittery and too scared to even fall asleep to try and rest because I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt wake up.

I also just feel so nauseous and keep burping up my breakfast because of the adrenaline and I‚Äôm still scared and scared I‚Äôm going to lose myself.",6,1744995129.0,Anxiety,8,0.88,False

i don't know where to start, because even i don't know where did i start losing myself. it started long before this, quietly like a loose thread of a sweater slowly pulling apart. i keep damaging myself and i don't know who to recover or move forward. my life is stood still. everything around me comes and goes and i stand there like this sweater slowing being pulled apart.

on 13th of april I was asleep, and my mom shook me awake and said, ""Wake up, I think Sultan is dead."" I woke up in shock. half asleep, I ran to the room, where I saw him lifeless, drooling, with one eye open. And all I could do was think was why I slept. If I hadn't slept, I could have rushed him to the vet been with him in his last moments made him comfortable. But the truth is by that point, he died alone and i didn't matter anymore anymore because all i was left with was guilt.

Let me take you back to when my cats were born. When my babies were born. on the 8th of February. something that was supposed to be beautiful memory. I couldn't be as happy for them as I wanted to, because four days prior to that, the love of my life left me. She abandoned me. And even though my cat giving birth was a beautiful thing, I couldn‚Äôt feel the joy I was supposed to. I couldn‚Äôt even smile properly. The grief was too loud. 2 days later the mother cat stopped feeding them so I stepped in. with milk replacers

I hand fed them every two hours, around the clock It kept me busy. And diverted my mind from my thoughts because I had to feed them every two hours. I stayed awake every night, all night long, just feeding them. In the day, I was asleep but waking up every two hours to feed them and also had to wake up five times a day to pray. I was maybe getting 3-4 hours of sleep a day at best . I was getting exhausted. Mentally, I was just getting messed up. I was losing myself. It wasn‚Äôt just the exhaustion. It was something deeper. I was losing my grip on reality.

It wasn‚Äôt just about the cats. If anything, my cats helped me. They were like my companions. I felt happy around them. I felt‚Ä¶ I felt great around them. I still do. It's just the fact that being in the situation that I was, I was just losing myself. I was disconnecting from reality. I was so busy doing stuff (other than my cats) doing stuff that doesn‚Äôt matter. Chores. Spending hours on them. My life felt like it had stopped. I was already fading already drowning in failures, and this huge pause in my life stretched longer than it should have. Life wasn‚Äôt moving forward. It was just‚Ä¶ sitting still. anyways slowly, the kittens started to grow. We named them Archie, Sultan, and Einstein ( called him Einie or Einnu for short ). I named them this because of one of my favorite movies, Back to the Future. I loved the name Einstein.

After that, days passed. I fed them every day. I played with them every day. They loved me, and I loved them. And it felt relieving seeing them bite my hands. They would be in the other room, and I would be asleep. My mom would open the door and they would all run to my room. Sultan would bite my hair and kick my head. He was the biggest, the healthiest. And I felt really nice. They made me feel nice. They made me feel better about my life. i felt part of a family maybe the reason i felt that is cause i'm an only child idk maybe.

But life has a cruel habit of reminding you how fragile happiness is i think all happiness, carries within it the seed of its own ending from the moment it comes into existense and just like that one day, Sultan‚Äôs tummy got upset. I gave him some Flagyl. And he was active, playing, running. Everything was great. The next morning, it got worse, so I took him to the vet. first thing when it opened cause i didn't sleep the night so i just waited for the clinic to open. He was still active at this point. The vet gave an injection for his fever, and one for his tummy.

I came home. i was with him for an hour he pooped a few times all were the upset ones but i thought the meds would kick in soon so I just thought I would sleep for a little while. And i closed my eyes the next thing i know i mom said wake up I think Sultan is dead. He‚Äôs not breathing.‚Äù I woke up in shock and ran to the other room, where I saw the result of my negligence. Still. Cold. and lifeless there was nothing I could do anymore but hold the regret of sleeping, only if i didn't sleep i would have been able to do something take it to the vet when he was near his end or maybe i could have just been with him comforting him in his final hours but he was gone....

We took him to the nearest park, where I buried him. I came home‚Ä¶ and he was just not there anymore. He passed on the 2nd of April. After Sultan, every morning felt like punishment and I didn‚Äôt know how to break free from it, whenever I would wake up with an intense heartbeat and it would feel like he was still here, and it was a dream. But it wasn‚Äôt. My baby was actually gone. and every time my mom shook me awake for breakfast, for anything I panicked. And everytime I'd think another one was gone. It became a reflex. more like a curse and i remember this happening when she left everyday id wake up with a really fast heart beat for a second feel like it was just a bad dream and check my phone and relive the fact that she really did abandon me.

And then, exactly on the 9th of April, Einie and Archie both got their tummies upset and passed blood in their stool. I took them to the vet immediately. He said‚Ä¶ he said it was most probably FPV. i was for the second time in my life afraid. the mortality rate of this virus was 90% and this is what sultan had. And you all must be wondering right now why didn‚Äôt I get them vaccinated? Well, it was because, firstly, I raised them myself. They were way smaller for their age because of not being on their mothers milk secondly i had just gotten them dewormed and third they were always a little bit sick and the vet said you can do their vaccination once they are healthy.‚Äù Because they would get sick here and there. But it‚Äôs on me. It‚Äôs my fault. I should have gotten them vaccinated whenever they felt the healthiest they would still be with me.

Anyways, We started it. It was fucking expensive. But I didn‚Äôt care. I just wanted my babies to be okay. We started treatment. Antibiotics. Drips. Vitamins. We even used blood from their father to create antibody serum. I read about the virus and I followed everything. I poured everything into saving them. I did everything by the book for their best chance of survival however my baby Einie kept losing weight. He kept losing himself. I stayed with him in the room the entire night. i never left his side. His situation was getting worse day by day. He kept vomiting, and I was just there, cleaning it, comforting him to the best of my ability

And I observed and learned that presence, even in silence, carries a great amount of weight. Even cats can feel the presence... I would leave the room, and he would vomit more. He would run around. Even though his mom and his brother were there. His mom was there because she was vaccinated, but her tummy was upset so I didn‚Äôt want to expose her to the dad. So she stayed in this room. however, when I stayed with Einie, he would vomit less. He would be calm. He would look at me occasionally. And he would just‚Ä¶ be Einie. The little cutie pie that he was my baby Einie

We then shifted him to drips. Three drips a day. He couldn‚Äôt eat or drink. He was losing himself. And I‚Ä¶ was doing everything I could for him. every drip, every injection, every moment he shut his eyes, every scream, every cry, I was there but it wasn't enough....Now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll bring myself to the last 48-72 hours I had with him. I didn‚Äôt sleep for a single second. I was with him the entire way When he slept I really wanted him to live. Because he was so loving. And I really loved him. I really loved him. I really loved him.

It broke me one day. It was 4 AM and Einie lost response to touch. I rushed him to the vet the same vet who was doing his treatment. I made them their clinic as they weren't a 24 hour service i called and called until he picked up and i made him come to the clinic and here‚Äôs what broke me. Whatever I was telling him, he was on his phone. I had a suspicion of what he was doing. And then I saw it. The vet‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt even trying. He was typing what I said into ChatGPT. Asking it how to save my boy as if i couldn't do that myself. all he did was copy paste my desperation... for a while i regretted ever bringing him to this vet but then again life and death is in gods hands not ours. he was at the point where i knew he would pass and i didn't have any money left to change the vet I had spent everything I had on these treatments. Every last penny. Every favor. Every drop of hope. That day, we got his medication done. I got home. I knew he probably wouldn‚Äôt make it through the night. I stayed. I stayed with him the entire night. He made it. The next day I got his drips. I got everything done.

I came back home. His breathing pattern changed. It felt like i was losing him, I was there cleaning every time he did peeopee or poopoo because he lost his urinary control and everything. He was slowly becoming a mess. I kept cleaning. And I was with him. somehow he made it through the night. And the next day I took him and his brother for the treatment. We got them drips, meds, everything. I came back. I cleaned him over and over. until i could not humanly keep my eyes open. ( i don't drink coffee or energy drinks ) And then I just slept a little, because I hadn‚Äôt slept in over 2 days

And as soon as I slept I shouldn‚Äôt have, but I did my mom told me to wake up. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not responding anymore.‚Äù She woke me up and before she even said anything, I was halfway across the room to him. I saw he was drenched in his own peepee and poopoo because he didn‚Äôt have control anymore. And i wasn't their to clean him and the dignity sheet under him when tho absorbed some of his mess it got on him. I told ChatGPT all his conditions. ChatGPT said these are his final moments. And I refused to believe that. I said, ‚ÄúNo, ChatGPT, no. Please tell me what to do to save him. Because I didn‚Äôt want to lose Einie he was my baby he was so loving. He slept with me. He played with me. He loved me. I loved him. I just didn‚Äôt want to let him go. i didn't want him to give up. he was at the end getting colder and colder

But he was suffering. He was suffering every time I took him to the vet. He was suffering so much. And it hurt me. It hurt me every time I saw him suffer, i wish i fucking wish i could take all his pain away i would a million times over. I prayed. And I prayed. And I kept praying. And I just asked ChatGPT to help me. It said, dry him first of all. Get him heat. get his body temp up Get him an electrolyte solution. I ran to my kitchen. I took a pan thingy. Then I kept some water on to boil so I could pour it into that bottle and keep it under him. But until it boiled, I was just getting anxious so i asked chat gbt and took him upstairs into the sunlight not direct, indirect sunlight. I ran back down. I took a pair of scissors and a towel. I dried him. I cut all the hair that had poop in it to make him comfortable. I ran back down. I made an electrolyte solution using honey and a pinch of salt. I ran back up. And I gave it slowly, putting one drop at a time on his gum. At first, he wasn‚Äôt swallowing‚Äîbut slowly, once every while, he was. So, when he swallowed it, it gave me just a tiny pinch of hope. And I held on to that.

I ran downstairs and I fell down hit my head broke my glasses but it didn‚Äôt feel painful. It felt like nothing. All I could think about was Einie. writing this i look and sound stupid but i just want to say it, I took him downstairs. I poured the hot water in the flask well not the flask, the water bottles, you know the water bottles that are for heating purposes. And then I kept giving him water. I kept cleaning him. At this point, I couldn‚Äôt even keep my eyes open not even for a bit. But I stayed up as long as I could. My body was giving out, but I stayed up cleaning him, giving him a few drops of the solution and i kepy talking to my baby telling him ""hey its gonna be okey dont you worry. you will be okey in no time and when you are we will play ill give u so many treats we will get you so many toys we will go on rides and we are gonna annoy everyone. i ekpt talking to him the entire day.

And then I could no longer stay awake. So I slept right beside him, with my finger in his paw. He was breathing really really fast. And I woke up every 10 to 15 minutes and gave him the electrolyte solution and i kept talking to him. I did this for hours. Until I woke up‚Ä¶ and I was the only one that woke up. And there I was, looking at my baby Einie, lying there lifeless. He didn‚Äôt even make a sound before going. And all I could feel was guilt. Guilt for the pain and suffering I caused him. Every time he got an injection. Every time he screamed. Every time he cried every vomit every ounce of pain. All of that guilt it just flooded in. That I did all this. I caused him all this suffering. Just for my own selfish wants. so many, so many feelings came rushing in. And I just couldn‚Äôt take it, so I cried. I know a man isn‚Äôt supposed to feel this whatever tf i was feeling But maybe I am pathetic. But I did cry. And I felt‚Ä¶ I felt alone. I felt vulnerable. I felt off. I felt rotten.

And‚Ä¶ I cleaned my tears before my mom got here. I took him to the same park as Sultan, where I buried my baby einie too and then‚Ä¶ I felt‚Ä¶ alone. Even though this wasn‚Äôt even long. I was with these kittens for less than 2 months, and I felt like I had known them for a lifetime. And I loved them. And I would have done anything for them to make them happy. But they‚Äôre gone now.

After that, I changed the vet. The new vet isn‚Äôt as expensive as the last one, because I used up a lot of money for Einie and Archie together. But even though this vet isn‚Äôt as expensive, he feels just as qualified. We‚Äôre doing everything by the book to save Archie. He‚Äôs battling FPV as i write this. He hasn‚Äôt lost any weight, but he hasn‚Äôt gained any either. And now I‚Äôll help him fight this battle And I hope he makes it. Because I love my cats. And I don‚Äôt have anything going on in my life right now‚Ä¶ except my cats. even if i did my cats are my family and for once in my life i don't want to lose i want want them to leave.

I hope Archie lives. All I can do now is pray.

when i die i want to get reunited with my friends my baby einie and sultan

If you‚Äôre reading this and got this far‚Ä¶ can you guys please pray for the health of my cats

Thank you everyone have great lives

‚ÄúSorry I‚Äôm late again, there were some issues with the medical charts I needed to sign off on.‚Äù I quickly apologized as I sat down at the table in the little coffee shop down the street from the hospital.

‚ÄúAnd I keep telling you, it‚Äôs not a problem,‚Äù The woman opposite me replied with a laugh, putting down the novel she was reading. ‚ÄúYou worry too much about nothing, Maus. You‚Äôre saving lifes, it‚Äôs a teeny bit more important than some coffee.‚Äù she added with a giggle, lightening my heart a bit.

The woman smiling at me as she idly fiddled with a pen was rather tall for a German woman, standing at nearly the same height as me 171 cm (5‚Äô9‚Äù) as opposed to my 173 cm (5‚Äô9‚Äù). She had beautiful curly brown hair, amber eyes that seemed to glimmer to hint at her strong spirit, framed by a pair of round glasses that matched mine.

Anneliese, my Anne, was the most beautiful person in the world to me.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a fairly thick book you‚Äôre reading today, what‚Äôs it about?‚Äù I ask, noticing the new books she was going through. She must have finished the last one already‚Ä¶ her reading pace always shocked me.

‚ÄúOh, this?‚Äù her eyes lit up immediately as she lifted up the book to show me the cover‚Ä¶ It looked like a fantasy novel. It had a beautiful art of an unarmoured man sitting by the side of a wounded or dead cerberus with tears running down his face.

I couldn‚Äôt quite make out the title, but it felt like it was quite long and in German:  
**Das Schlachtfeld im Blut der Unschuldigen**.  
Translating: **‚ÄòThe Battlefield Highlighted in the Blood of the Innocent‚Äô**.  
Quite a somber name.

‚ÄúThis book was only published three days ago, but I just know that it‚Äôs going to be an incredible story so I just had to pre-order it. I can‚Äôt wait for the first batch to get to the store by next week.‚Äù She boasted about her foresight with a smug smile, holding the book like some great achievement.

Even though she had written novels of her own, Anne was such an avid book-lover that she was as proud of someone else‚Äôs books selling well as she was her own. And it‚Äôs that intense passion that led her to open her own bookstore even though her family wanted her to go into law.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of those ‚ÄòAnother world‚Äô stories, but it‚Äôs quite a unique, if brutal story!‚Äù she excitedly started explaining the story, even forgetting to drink her coffee from how engrossed she was. It was another side of her that I loved.

It was a story that started with an ordinary accountant working for a big company. Unlike most ‚Äòisekai‚Äô stories I read or heard of, it went into quite a bit of detail about his life on Earth.  
It talked about his wife and children, his strained relationship with his parents, how he was mostly raised by his grandparents, what his daily life in the office looked like, the co-workers he met everyday, the people he liked, the people he didn‚Äôt.

The inciting incident of this story was a misplaced number in an expense sheet. One query led to another and one discrepancy pointed ten more, and before long he had found himself in the midst of an investigation into one of the largest frauds of the decade!

He had never expected to get this far in his investigation, and some of his earlier queries finally got to the ears of the higher ups. He was called to a private meeting and offered a deal to drop his investigation and never think about it again.

When something like this happens in most stories, the main character would refuse like it‚Äôs obvious and whistleblow the whole thing, leading to some kind of suspense or thriller story, or maybe a mystery or something. I remember someone whistleblowing the Enron scandal the same way?

However, the main character was just an average man, one with a family to care for and fear of the forces infinitely stronger than him. So he took the deal, refusing money in exchange for an agreement to act like none of this happened.

It wasn‚Äôt soon after that someone else slipped up while covering the fraud up and the dominos rapidly started to fall one after the other, leading to the company shutting down and a prolonged legal battle.

While the main character wasn‚Äôt legally affected, somehow his involvement had slipped out. One of the employees who lost their job because of everything collapsing how it did took his anger out on the easiest target to reach, the main character‚Äôs family, murdering them on the weekend while the main character was out interviewing for a new job.

Returning home to see his family dead, he was engulfed in despair.  
From there, a period of time passed where he had cut himself off from the world and locked himself up in his home, time rapidly passing with little being noted aside from his deteriorating mental state.

Then one day, when he was finally fed up with life, a devil appeared before him, offering him a deal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll return your family, as they were the day before they died, if you work for me for the rest of your life.‚Äù

In exchange for bringing his family back, he would have to spend the rest of his life in another world, working towards the devil‚Äôs objective‚Ä¶ and he took the deal, not knowing if it really did bring them back to life or not.  
At that point, the story of his grueling life in this other world started.

As Anne was describing all of this, I felt a knot in my stomach, and I didn‚Äôt know why‚Ä¶ It was just a story. I hadn‚Äôt even read the story myself, so why am I feeling so troubled? I usually enjoy Anne‚Äôs presence and hearing her stories no matter what, even when she talks about horror stories or other unpleasant stories‚Ä¶

And then I realised, it was because I tried to put myself in that man‚Äôs shoes. If I lost everyone I cared about, what lengths would I go to to bring them back? Would I make a deal that isn't even guaranteed to work?  
I didn‚Äôt. Rather than jumping at the chance to take a deal with a devil, I put them off.

Even at this point, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder what the right thing to do was? It was all happening too soon, I didn‚Äôt even know if there was another means to travel between worlds‚Ä¶ though I could feel that was just hopeless optimism.

When I turned to ask Anne what she thought, I froze.  
Me? Talking with a devil? When did this happen? That was after I woke up in another world, but I‚Äôm on my Earth, here with Anne‚Ä¶

Completely disregarding the myriad of emotions that must have shown on my face, Anne continued talking about the story, but I couldn‚Äôt hear it. No, maybe I just couldn‚Äôt focus on it, it just sounded like background sound‚Ä¶ This was just a memory. Looking at the cover of the book again, even though I knew what it said I couldn‚Äôt make out the details of the actual text.

With this weird moment of incongruity, I turned back to Anne, taking the opportunity to see her face again, even a fake version, as the world darkened and folded into itself around her.

Watching this beautiful dream collapse around me, I couldn‚Äôt help but wish I could have lingered a little longer, see Anne a little bit more‚Ä¶ unfortunately it wasn‚Äôt meant to be. I suppressed the ache in my heart as I promised myself I would do everything I could to see her even a moment sooner.

Before long, the world faded to darkness, and All I could hear were the sounds of rain and winds pelting the outer walls around me. I was probably in a building with the storm already outside. After a few moments I also noticed the sound of several people breathing in the same room.  
It was a strange experience, having my hearing be so good.

I also noticed I could hear the muffled sounds of people talking from some other room, but disregarded it for now.

There was someone dozing off beside me, slightly higher than me. Their breaths were quiet and their sleep was light. I felt confident this might have been Kanako.

Another person was soundly sleeping lower than me, close to where the ‚Äòfootboard‚Äô of a bed would be. Perhaps they were sprawled on the floor, and they were quite loud yet relaxed. I pegged it to either be the elf Nisha or the cowboy Vildost‚Ä¶ but I didn‚Äôt smell that strong scent of alcohol, so it was likely Nisha.

And a third person was further away, breathing somewhat calmly, though they slowed down now and then before letting out quiet grunts. This person was awake, maybe having bouts of fitful sleep. I already heard Vildost sleep so there was no way it was him, therefore it must have been the silent warrior Arashi.

Slowly opening my eyes, I saw a stone ceiling. It was a little damp, but seemed sturdy. I was laying on a decently comfortable bed and there was little light in the room, solely coming from two candles..  
Turning my head to look around, I found that I was spot on with my guesses.

Kanako was dozing off on a chair next to my bed, completely covered up and still wearing her hooded cloak, without an inch of her skin showing despite how warm it was. I couldn‚Äôt see Nisha but I heard him‚Ä¶ on the floor, even though there were four more empty beds in the room. And Arashi‚Ä¶ was sitting at a table at the far end of the room, frowning at a piece of paper she was reading under the candlelight.

***\[Sigh‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre inscrutable, and suicidal.\]*** I heard the devil mutter a few seconds after I opened my eyes, and I wanted to sigh too. ***\[If you‚Äôre this reckless, maybe I just need to sit back and wait. You‚Äôll probably get yourself killed soon enough and I‚Äôll just pick out a new warlock.\]***

Her words were laced with mockery, but if that was an option she considered, then she wouldn‚Äôt have gone out of her way to save me. I still clearly remembered her using magic to move the rock pillars to protect me.

***\[Just so you know, that cloaked girl next to you likely knows or at least suspects my presence.\]*** she off-handedly added, surprising me before I remembered that Kanako could sense mana quite well. It made sense.

***||Are you planning on just following me for the rest of my life, or don‚Äôt you have somewhere better to be?||*** I asked, repeating my question from the morning. ***\[That‚Äôs a weird way to ask someone to be your lover, you‚Äôre a bold one\~\]*** and she replied with nonsense. Of course. Why did I expect better

If I followed examples from the various stories I‚Äôve read, I‚Äôd hide my secrets as thoroughly as I could and only reveal it to people I fully trust‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not really any of those characters. I doubted if I could do something like that.

Keeping this devil a secret didn‚Äôt seem a very viable or smart decision, and I never intended on keeping her a secret to begin with. I believe the saying was *‚ÄúIf you must eat crow, then eat the crow while it is young and tender, or surely you will have to eat it when it is old and tough.‚Äù*

Admitting to something people might find wrong and objectionable early would be better than them finding out about it much later and feeling betrayed. Hiding the truth forever was something I didn‚Äôt have the confidence in doing, either.

Letting out a sigh, I slowly sat up, my body aching as I did so, and my eyes immediately met with Arashi‚Äôs, causing her to quickly fold the paper and put it away. I made a mental note of that.

‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù she asked in a low voice, but I heard her well despite the background sound. Before I could even say anything Kanako woke up with a jolt, her posture quickly straightening as she looked around, noticing me awake.  
In the dim candlelight and with her hood covering her, I couldn‚Äôt see her expression. Though I could imagine her eyes widening as she hopped to her feet.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake! Nisha, Arashi, Armin‚Äôs awake!‚Äù she quickly turned to the rest of the room and called out. Arashi, already awake, just nodded, while Nisha let out a surprised snort before sitting up and looking around confused.  
I couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle at this.

Before long, Nisha had found and dragged a sleeping Vildost hugging what looked like a whiskey bottle into the room. Not too long after that, I was sitting on the bed, while the remaining bunch were awake and seated‚Ä¶ on a chair (Kanako), the floor (Nisha), and a bed (Vildost) and one was standing (Arashi).

To start, Arashi sincerely thanked me for my risky actions to save her, lowering her head in a bow and promising to pay back this great favour to the best of her ability. I wanted to say that it felt a bit exaggerated‚Ä¶ but it was true that I risked my life for hers. So I could only accept her gratitude for now.

And Vildost laughed, joked about suing me for copyright infringement for stealing his plan, and then thanked me, offering the ‚Äòwhiskey bottle‚Äô as a thank you‚Ä¶ it was juice. Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should feel insulted or laugh.

Then Kanako told me off for being incredibly reckless‚Ä¶ and I couldn‚Äôt deny that. Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt even dream of doing something so dangerous, but at the moment‚Ä¶ All I could remember was Milvarr.

I still had to ensure Milvarr‚Äôs burial, find out who killed her and Millar, even if it was just for some closure, investigate what I could about teleportation magic, learn the basics of alchemy, find out Arashi‚Äôs circumstances‚Ä¶ The number of responsibilities I picked up on this new Earth were quickly building. This was only the night of my third day in this world, yet it feels like it‚Äôs been weeks.

Ah, right, and I also had to deal with the devil on my shoulder.

‚ÄúI was so scared, I thought you were going to drown in the river, especially when I saw all the magic that thing in the water was using! If you hadn‚Äôt-‚Äù she suddenly paused, lips pursing, before continuing with what felt like a separate train of thought. ‚ÄúIf you hadn‚Äôt survived, what would we do!?‚Äù

Because I already knew that she sensed the devil‚Äôs magic, I could tell that she was being considerate to avoid letting that slip. Maybe she would ask me about it separately, if we had the chance.

Also, Nisha just said I was brave and cool like Vildost. I don‚Äôt appreciate that ‚Äòcompliment‚Äô for so many reasons, but I had to just accept it because of the childish innocence he said it with. Was this really a person who‚Äôs lived decades longer than me?

That settled with, I asked about the ‚Äòtreasure‚Äô... the golem core. And Kanako pointed out an empty translucent orb next to me on the bed.  
‚ÄúIt kept activating when we took it away from you‚Ä¶ because of the storm, anyone who could help turn it off is really busy.‚Äù Kanako explained.

Watching the empty orb and remembering the powerful cyan light that bled from it underwater. ‚ÄúSo, it‚Äôs something like a golem core, right? Is this the treasure we were after?‚Äù I asked, wondering if this was what Arashi wanted. I didn‚Äôt think the fact it was a golem core needed to be hidden‚Ä¶ maybe they‚Äôre illegal in this country/in general?

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù the quiet warrior tersely replied. ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt what I was looking for‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSo the hunt was a failure, huh?‚Äù I asked, chuckling. ‚ÄúWhat are we doing with this then?‚Äù  
It wasn‚Äôt the item we wanted, so our agreed split probably didn‚Äôt apply here.

‚ÄúWe can try selling it and split the money.‚Äù Arashi suggested.  
‚ÄúIf it is a golem core, we can‚Äôt just sell it. Trade on them is very regulated, it‚Äôd be a crime if we did it wrong!‚Äù Kanako immediately objected.

‚ÄúWhat is golem? And what is regulated?‚Äù Nisha asked, ‚ÄúThis ball made the stones fly? Is it dangerous to sell?‚Äù He didn't understand some of the words because of a language barrier.

‚ÄúWell, if we can‚Äôt sell it‚Ä¶ then we have just gotten a new best friend! Golem buddy, come one, what d‚Äôya say? It‚Äôd be reeaally cool, right!?‚Äù Vildost‚Äôs suggestion was inane. That was something you‚Äôd see in one of those power fantasy isekai. How would we even go about that!?

‚ÄúOkay fine fine, shoooot down my hopes and dreams \*hick\*, why don‚Äôt ya?‚Äù he said, letting out an overly exasperated sigh under everyone‚Äôs stare. Even Nisha was incredulous.  
‚ÄúPutting thaat aside, what did you think washh down there?‚Äù He asked Arashi, swaying a bit as he slurred. Just how drunk was he, and why was he still so drunk even after this long!?

He still has good coordination despite being this drunk, so he‚Äôs either not been such a chronic drinker for long, or has a unique constitution because from his race? I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôll look into that too.  
Either way, I was interested in what Arashi was looking for as well. Everyone was interested.

The person in question didn‚Äôt immediately reply, silently shifting their gaze between us, before looking away. I noticed her clench a fist as she stood back against the wall, hesitating.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù she started speaking, but stopped again. ‚ÄúNo, you all risked your life hunting for this ‚Äòtreasure‚Äô... I‚Äôll tell you properly.‚Äù she said with resignation. ‚ÄúThe item I was looking for is a necromancy tool.‚Äù

Kanako gasped at that and even Vildost let out a ‚ÄúHo damn‚Äù. Nisha didn‚Äôt react.. He might have already known about it. I was shocked too.

*Necromancy‚Ä¶* the study of crossing the world of the dead with that of the living. It could mean anything from communing with the dead to bringing them back in the form of an undead, or even curses that caused endless suffering to the living.

While I didn‚Äôt know if necromancy was the same in this world as widely imagined in mine, I found the thought more than a bit abhorrent.

‚ÄúMiss Kurohana, you‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not like that.‚Äù Arashi quickly interrupted Kanako. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt say just yet, but I need necromancy to fix‚Ä¶ something. It‚Äôs the only thing I can think of, I don‚Äôt need the item beyond that.‚Äù

The room went quiet after that, the atmosphere notably heavier.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ understand if you do not wish to travel with me further knowing that, however my reasons are personal and I do not know if I can trust you with it.‚Äù she stated. Her voice sounded calm yet her hands trembled a bit, even as she clenched them.

I didn‚Äôt blame her completely for not saying anything, it was a common thing to hide things. ‚ÄòHarmless lies‚Äô made the world run smoother, after all.  
I myself had several secrets‚Ä¶ that I was from another world, that I was living on in the corpse of someone from this world, and the devil tied to me, Kanako was clearly hiding much too, including her face. Vildost was hiding his racial features, and possibly much more. Nisha‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt imagine him hiding much, honestly.

Despite how we had formed so carefreely, like a simple party of characters in some story, we were just a collection of strangers who didn‚Äôt really ‚Äòknow‚Äô each other.  
But‚Ä¶ if I were being honest, I felt like we could be more than just a collection of strangers.

Hello there! It's me, the author\~

I hope you've been enjoying the story so far. I've been having a lot of fun writing it!  
I've been planning on giving the story a more fitting name because while I called it ""Havenbound: A guilded journey"", I've been spending a lot more time on building the characters and having them learn about each other, when I expected to have gotten into the 'journey' part of the story by now...

Suffice to say, the pace has been a lot slower than I expected.  
If you have any good ideas you'd like to suggest for the name after everything you've read so far, I'd love to hear it in the comments below!",3,1744995078.0,HFY,2,0.81,False

It was a cold dusk in early March. The winter had departed at last ,but only for the late mornings and afternoons, it seemed. It came mooching past in the evenings and early mornings moodily. It was somehow akin to Polly's recent mood as well. She also at times felt all too content and satisfied with warmth inside her when she thought about time with him and now at others, she would helplessly fall into the cold abyss of the possibilities that she hoped she were most certainly wrong thinking about. For the past couple of weeks, Samuel had been imploring and requesting her and Polly had after all given in to his persistent begging. She had thought and thought and thought. It was a rather important and serious decision and at the time being, it seemed the most reliable solution to her. She thought to herself, ""And, what reason do I have to not go? He's mine after all and I'm his. We are each other's --Ever and Forever!"". She murmured a little louder than she would have liked, "" Hopefully "". 

She held two dresses from their hangers in either of her hands. In her left, it was a beautiful pink and white cotton dress with cherries printed on it. The dress had ruby red straps and was patterned in a wavy style. The dress reached her ankles and fitted her perfectly at all the places it should. However, she was inclined not to wear that to Samuel's place today. The dress gave her a rosy glow‚Äîone she didn‚Äôt want him to admire today, not until she was certain his affection belonged to her . Maybe infact, she didn't want him to ever look up at her again in anything or anywhere if her fears come true. She could only get answers if things went as she had planned. So, she chose the dress in her right hand. She knew she was going to wear that for certain now. The silky black fabric of the sleeveless dress, its magnificent gloss, its elegant cowl , paired with her usual whitegold earrings, her golden watch, and  her pointed black heels gave her the confidence, the courage, and the strength that she may need , yet wouldn't compromise raw sexuality on a platter. She had straightened her hair and clutched them at the back but while looking into the mirror one last time she decided to let them loose after all. If anyone looked in her eyes today, some would see hope while others may see grit.

She wore her black long-coat and texted a cab to Elm Street from her room. She locked the door to her apartment and took the elevator to the ground floor. She waited about 7 minutes as per the application for her cab. The driver was a middle aged black lady with a smile so contagious Polly would have doubly reciprocated had she been her usual self. On the contrary, she barely managed to even greet her back and could only pass an artificial sort of smile she thought only psychos were capable of doing, where they smile by moving their muscles ever so slightly that it could be basically none at all.

Sam and his roommate Kyler,rented the basement of a house on the outskirts of the city.  He was in between jobs for some time when she and him were still new but had been doing well at this job for a decent amount of time now. He was 20 something and had chosen not to go for higher education as he wanted to do something of his own,while Polly was 18 and a Freshman in university studying pre-health. They had met at a cafe where he was a server before he started at the restaurant. She had gone there to study with her friend, Ginny and Sam flirted with Polly. She thought of him as pretty and ended up giving her number to him. They texted a couple of days and then he asked her out on a date. Polly started to really like him. He was always so kind, respectful,soft-spoken , and polite to her. They had lots of fun together -- cafes, movies, picnics, amusement parks, anything and everything they could do in their own city.

One night , on text he asked her to send her a hot picture of hers and Polly did so without thinking much as she trusted him now. It was a mirror selfie and she wore an oversized white T shirt that she pulled off of her left shoulder. Her legs were not covered and the small shorts were covered under the t-shirt as well. He said he could not help admiring her body as he had never seen any as beautiful as hers. She felt so thrilled and confident to receive compliments about herself. It was good for her as she was quite conscious about it always during high school as she was not the popular kind back then. It was obviously going to happen but she was still sort of fazed when he suggested they both sleep together. It was not at all cheap and questionable,rather it was heartfelt and meaningful because of how he talked about it being an expression of love, an act of desire for one's lover, and not some lewd or messed up fantasies some men have at times. Even though he was ever so gentle about the matter, even his repeatedly assuring her that he understands her choice completely, even after he told her not to worry and that he respected her boundaries, she was still stunned a little. She was only scared as she had never slept with anyone before. While they never really talked about it for another week, Polly herself texted him that she wanted to tell him something important and told him her hesitancy's main reason. He did not at all sound ridiculing or weird but confessed of him also of having never done it before with anyone. This meant a lot to Polly and she started to prepare her mind because after all she had also developed something special for the boy in her heart.

One weekend, they were out for a picnic at a park. They were sitting under a tree on a cross patterned light blue picnic blanket. Sam leaned his back against the bark of the tree with his legs crossed and stretched straight and Polly was resting her head on Sam's lap. She was reading a magazine and he was playing with her hair and putting small white wildflowers in them. The sun shone brilliantly. Sam looked at the time on his phone and said, "" I need to go to my shift, which is at 6 in the evening, and you know it takes half an hour to reach the cafe I work at and I need another half to get ready, so I should be home by 5 at least. What time is it now? "" 

""There's time yet, it's only quarter to four currently, don't worry"", replied Polly. "" Also, it says in this magazine that you should keep asking your partner questions to keep their memory sharp about the relationship"", she said mischievously. 
""I'll go first then"", he said, beamingly. Polly laughed and said alright.
 "" What is my friend Kyler's full name? "" She giggled and therefore couldn't answer immediately so Sam started saying laughily, "" Haha, I already win, you don't remember that. "" 
Polly stopped laughing abruptly and spoke in a single breath, ""Kyler Bartholomew Pickleford McSnortington III"" Hearing this out loud, both started guffawing heartily.
"" So, is it my turn now? ""
 ""Go ahead"" 
"" So what were the names of the kids we decided one day in a children's park, you have to tell for both the girl and the boy? ""
"" The boy is Ethan"" 
"" Uh huh, correct "" 
"" The girl is Amber"" 
""Amber?"" Polly laughed, then hesitated. ""I thought we said Maria?"" 
""Did we?"" Sam shrugged, smiling casually. ""Maybe I just liked the sound of Amber."" She nodded, the name lingering in her mind longer than she expected. 
""No, you lose, it's not Amber, it's Maria, and honestly this is shocking to me, how can one be so wrong about something, maybe a little, maybe you remembered Marianne or Margot or Mariam from our Maria, but Amber. "" 
Polly said in an overly dramatic tone and with rather animated expressions to taunt her boyfriend. 
"" Maria!!, when did we decide that, I distinctly remember Amber, maybe you are mistaken, Polly "". 
Suddenly his phone vibrated and they both looked to her side. She saw the notification as well. It was from someone whose contact was just saved 'A'. The text said -- "" Still up to meeting at 4: 30."" An emoji accompanied the text. It was a blush emoji that has a smile with squinted eyes. 
Polly straight up asked who that was. Sam told her it was just some friend who was helping him get a job at the restaurant as a server. 
He said, "" It'll be a lot more money, both in my hourly wage and the tips. It'll be easier and faster to save money. "" 
""And, since when do men talk with emojis like that "" Polly asked laughingly. 
"" Haha, it's A for Airon, Polly, I think he's bisexual most probably"", saying that he brushed the matter off. Polly was still a little sceptical though. Soon after, it was time to go, so they packed their stuff and he walked her to her apartment building and said goodbye.

Couple days later, they were both going to have lunch at Polly's place and she was using her laptop to read the recipe. She noticed it was going to die soon. She asked, "" Could you pass me your phone? My laptop is dying."" 
"" Well, where is your phone?"" 
"" It's in my room. Now hurry ,pass it. "" 
"" Wait for a second. "" He went to Polly's room and fetched her her cellphone. 
She was quite annoyed. ""You could have just given me yours, mister. "" 
""I'm actually waiting for an important email. "" 
"" I could have informed you, you are literally right there. Now, it feels as if you have things to hide, that need to be kept secret. Do I assume things , then ,Samuel? "" 
""Polly, you are taking it the wrong way. I'm just worried about my future. It's just a job email. I am just too stressed. I'm so sorry. I should have thought things through. You want my phone, you can have it, hell you can keep it forever, I don't want it, not at the stake of ‚Äòus‚Äô"", He said with a crack in his voice and watery eyes.
Polly was going to get his phone but he leapt up from the couch and embraced her in a hug. He started crying while hugging her. Polly thought to herself maybe she had been a little too harsh on the boy but she was still in a little doubt. She thought to herself if this was an act, the performance was top notch. She hugged him back and they both forgot about the stove completely. The smoke alarm started going off and both started moving their hands to clear it off. She quickly turned the stove off and he ran to the bathroom and fetched a towel and used it instead of his hands. Soon, the alarm was also gone and she was just looking at him and was smiling and it came to her mind how worried this boy was for her. Their eyes matched suddenly and as soon as he caught a glimpse of her, he stopped. He ran his hand embarrassingly through his hair. Polly started laughing . So did he. They both laughed their hearts off. 
"" I can restart with the  recipe, I have all the ingredients , you do the prep till I come from a quick run to the grocery store down two blocks. "", said Polly while getting her wallet and she left. She was in there buying some cheese when she bumped into someone. The item she was holding fell down. She bent down to pick it from the ground. The other person also started apologizing and started to help her. She looked at them. It was Airon. She remembered him and by the looks it seemed, he did too. 
""Hi, Airon. "" 
""Hello, Polly, how are you? "" 
""I'm doing good, you tell? "" 
"" I'm doing great as well. It's been so long since we've met. "" 
"" Haha, it has, but at least you and Samuel are meeting regularly and I just wanted to thank you for helping him for the job at the restaurant. "" 
"" The restaurant, I was helping him get a job at the warehouse Polly and we only talked about it when we were at the club for a night out and that was weeks ago. He said he wasn't interested. I hope you are not confusing me with someone else. Maybe , it was Kyler who might be helping him for that job. OK, Polly I have to go, I'm in a hurry. We all should catch up sometimes. Goodbye"" saying this he left the aisle. Polly had been in doubt since then. After reaching her apartment back, she could not understand Sam, the guy she was so happy to be with always. The entire afternoon, he managed to keep talking about funny things to keep the air light, because of what happened before. Polly laughed and expressed mechanically the entire time. Her doubts now intensified. She knew she had to get to the roots of the matter to confirm her theories. And, she knew, she would.

She was outside Sam's place in 20 minutes. He was at the door within seconds of her ringing the doorbell. He looked like he just came home from a shift at the restaurant as he was still in his tucked-in white linen shirt with ebony trousers while his tie and belt were gone. His medium length layered flow of dark brown hair was looking pretty as always. His brown eyes seemed to be filled with excitement and that should have filled Polly's heart with happiness but it kind of annoyed her today. "" You look fabulous, Polly "", said he while taking her left hand and gently pulling her in towards an embrace. He shut the door close and they both took a step inwards. He placed both his hands on her face and kissed her passionately. He stopped midway and looked into her eyes as if trying to read her mind. She smiled while looking back at him. ""Where's the bathroom? I need to use it. "" asked Polly. 
"" Let's just go to the bedroom, you can use it there. "" From the living room, he led her to a corridor past the staircase, which had another small passage to the left at the end. The passage had two doors on opposite walls. The one on the left was closer and the one on the right was farther. The latter said Kyler on the door. They entered Sam's room and Polly went to the bathroom. She texted her live location to Ginny. She took out her perfume again and applied some to her wrists and her neck. She reentered the room. He was not in the room. Polly looked at herself in the mirror that was on the wall opposite to the bathroom. She placed her bag on the TV cabinet against the other wall. Meanwhile, Sam came from behind and picked her up. He dimmed the light and played some light music. Polly locked her arms around his neck. He shut the door to his room and led them both to the bed. He placed her on the bed with her back towards it and started removing his shirt. He laid himself over her and pulled the sheets over..........

Polly was lying wide awake, while Sam spooned her from behind and was in a deep sleep, it seemed. She looked at the clock, it struck half past midnight. She was wearing one of Sam's t-shirts. She carefully removed his hand from her waist and gently placed it on the bed. She surreptitiously reached the other side of the bed and picked his cellphone up. She then reached her bag, she texted Ginny to come immediately at her location and shoved her dress in her bag. It was not possible to put the heels in there, so she thought she might have to carry it in her hands. She then went into the bathroom with Samuel's phone. Only she knew how she had managed to get his passcodes. She unlocked it immediately. She opened his Photos first. After some searching, she found the ones she had hoped were just a misunderstanding of hers, but they were very real. She looked at him with not one or two, but several other girls. Girls his age, younger girls, older ones. She felt a combination of disgust and fury, and most importantly she felt severely heartbroken. She searched the contact 'A' in his messaging app and was immediately certain , it was definitely not Airon. It was some other girl. She wondered, did this girl know, or was she as na√Øve as Polly was or was she super cunning who was in on this with this evil boy? She sent herself, Ginny, and this 'A' person the filthy pictures and deleted the messages from Sam's Phone. She also sent herself this girl's number. She flushed the toilet for nothing and washed her tear smeared face. She silently placed his phone back. She ran to get her bag and heels, there was no way she could wear those. She left the room, down the corridor back to the living room and tried to open the front door. She was panicked, nervous, hurried and deeply hurt. She couldn't think properly because of all the thoughts running wild in her head with the pictures coming to her mind recurringly and her eyes were tear filled which made her vision blurry. The lock would not give in. She heard footsteps. Samuel was awake. "" Polly! "" He shouted. "" What have you sent Anastasia , why is she threatening me with her texts."" The lock opened, but he got her first. He caught her arm and pulled her in. He hit her face with all might. He then caught her hair. "" You, b**ch "" He groaned, "" What have you told Anastasia, why is she mad? You better know, his father is a lawyer and she'll send us both to jail. I can get out myself, I have connections. You'll be her only target."" He slammed her head into the banisters on the staircase. She was on the ground crying with her head in her hands and she was facing away from him. He then turned her face towards her and started choking her with both hands. Polly gasped for air, she wasn't able to breathe. She tried to loosen his grip but couldn't. She lost all hope when suddenly she heard a thud and his hands were gone in an instant. He fell to the ground. Polly saw a fierce Ginny with a pen in one hand and a flower pot in her other hand that she had probably picked from Sam's living room. She told Polly to pick her stuff up and hurry. She did so. 
"" Is he dead? "" Polly asked, wailing. 
"" No, only knocked out, "" Ginny responded. 
"" Let's leave. "" 
They both went out to Ginny's car. As they drove out, Polly removed her T-shirt as well and threw it out on the  street. She just wanted Sam's everything to be taken out of her life. She wore her dress back. 
"" Where are we going, Ginny? "" 
""To my place, I thought he could come to your place as he knows where you live. It's better you stay with me, he doesn't know where I live. And, I have seen the pictures you have sent me. So listen, we are in this together. I'll personally make sure his life is hell, Polly. If the law would not do anything, I would. But let's first go to the Emergency room and get your head bump checked "", said Ginny, while gritting her teeth. At the ER, when the nurse asked the cause of the injury, they both looked at each other. Polly said she just fell and bumped her head and the neck bruises were some chemical reaction from metal jewelry that didn't suit her skin. The nurse thought a little and without any change in her demeanor or composure said she would need to take pictures of the injuries. She did so and then just bandaged her head where it was hit. 

After the hospital, they went to Ginny's place and she ordered her some tomato soup and also made her some warm tea, meanwhile. "" You want to talk now or tomorrow or at your own time or never, everything is up to you, Polly. I'm here for you. "" 
"" Her name is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Anastasia"" Polly could barely speak. "" 
‚ÄúWhich one is her, there are too many. "" 
"" I don't know, but I have her number. I sent that to myself. "" 
"" And, what do you plan to do with that? "" 
"" I think I want to meet her. "" 
"" Are you sure, Polly? "" Ginny's voice finally weakened in strength from what it had been the entire time before. A tear streamed across Polly's face and with a crack in her voice, she spoke, "" Lies, betrayal, dishonesty, manipulation, guilt trips, I want to ask her if she was aware or was I the dumb one only, the one he could so easily convince of whatever he wanted to. "" 
"" Stop, Polly, how can you be the weak one, Hell! You are the bravest of them all. You're the one who has managed to find out first about anything going on with that criminal. You showed enough strength to fight a man double your size physically. You managed to outsmart him with your wit and procured the passcodes he was so secretive about, honestly that still shocks me. What a mastermind you are. And, no one talks like that about my friend, not even my friend. "" Polly laughed a little while crying and Ginny joined her to boost her morale. 
"" Let's text her, she's awake, she was the reason Sam awoke"" 
"" What are you going to say"" 
"" Just to let her know I want to meet her. "" 
"" Okay. "" 
Polly texted the contact and told her her name and that she was the one who sent her the pictures and asked her to meet her at 10 at Baker's cafe on the High street. Ginny suggested it as it was close to her place. Anastasia replied 'Alright'. It was the next morning and after getting ready she and Ginny went to the cafe. They both immediately recognized an Asian girl with dark black straight hair  with even bangs as one of the girls from the pictures. She was drinking water and hadn't ordered anything. Polly realized she was shaking, though from anger, fear, anxiety, or nerves, she didn't know. Ginny placed her hand on her shoulder. Polly resolved and went to the table Ana was at. She stood there and said "" You must be Anastasia "" 
"" You must be Polly, then"", she said without standing up, "" Sit "" 
"" Three coffees please"" Ana said to the waitress. 
"" Thank you so much for agreeing to meet --"" 
"" We are both the only ones he was dating, the rest were just one night stands. And, thank you for doing what you did, I know now what needs to be done. "" She cut Polly short and said. 
"" He has my pictures. He'll probably threaten to share those online. "" 
"" My father is a great lawyer, he knows how to deal with scum like this. "" 
"" He said he has connections to get him out. "" 
"" Lies. Mere lies. "" 
"" What if it's true? "" 
"" Darling, I know him, he could not buy me a 20 dollar book, he's nothing and he's got nothing and if you support me, I'll make sure, he remains a ‚Äònothing‚Äô . "" 
"" How? "" 
"" See, Cheating on your partner is not a crime, but physical abuse is. I see the marks on your neck and your head. And you and I can obviously both charge him for mental harassment and the kind of person he is, he will blackmail us both because of our pictures, so that'll add to the list as well. But, your support is essential. So, please do it, it's a request. I know how challenging it'll be, but you and I can do this. "" Ana said watery-eyed. 
"" I'll do it, certainly, why would I not? I trusted him so much, he deserves the worst. "" 
"" That's ma girrlll!! "", Ginny said lightening the atmosphere. 
Both received texts suddenly one after the other and to no one's surprise they were from Samuel. He did not exactly do what they thought he would do, he sent them messages apologizing and that he really loved them. It was funny how the same message was literally sent without even changing any of the words. 
"" We fell for this one, seriously? "" 
"" The truth is always bitter"", said Polly. 
"" This one's really not --rather,to me, it's a sweet truth. "" 
They finished their coffees and were just about to leave when Polly asked her one last thing, "" You can choose not to answer, but did you two ever decide your future kids' names? "" 
""Yeah"" 
""Anthony for a boy and for a girl, it was Amber. "", Ana left after saying that. 
""Amber. Not mine. Never mine.It wasn‚Äôt a mistake. It was a memory"", thought Polly and that gave her just more reason for her cause.

1k29mo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Umrah/comments/1k29mo6/elaf_qinwan_hotel/,Elaf Qinwan Hotel,"*Hoping to write a detail review of the Hotel. Good option for Solo travelers, not really for families.* 

A lot of you who've been booking recently might see this being pushed to the top on [booking.com](http://booking.com), Agoda, and other places.

The ratings seem good, the rooms modern, it's a reputed brand, but the prices cheap..

**So, what's the catch?**

I went there with this mindset, having paid 90 SAR per night. I wasn't sure about anything and was quite aware of not having my hopes high for the amount I had paid.

Having stayed here for 10 nights in total, here's what you need to know.

*  The hotel is located halfway through, on a detour from the famous Umm Al Qura road (check maps), quite literally perpendicular to it. It's on a road called Sharaa Mansour. 
* Google Maps misleadingly suggests you can drive straight to the Umm Al Qura bridge and turn right to join the main road. 
* In reality, that route is blocked, forcing taxis to take a left, loop back with a U-turn, and return. As a result, most drivers refused to take me to the Haram or charged 20‚Äì30 SAR for the trip.
* The hotel, though, is visible from a distance, but its entrance kinda blends in with the rest of the shops nearby. It took me and the driver a second to point out. 
* Once you enter, there's nothing impressive about the reception. It's plain and simple, and for an only 3-month-old hotel, it already looks a bit dated. 
* The walk from the entrance to the reception is quite a bit. The hotel is narrow in width but extends further in the back. Very interesting design. 
* You walk through a waiting place, souq, caf√©, another shop, and another until you reach the reception.
* Reception staff are decent and your average, let's-just-get-the-job-done kinda people. I was swiftly told to come after Asr, and I complied and gave my luggage to the bellman, who was too stiff and of the same attitude. 
* They were kind to give me a room with a view upon request
* The lifts are dated too, and I'm saying this after living in Wirgan Noor for a couple of days, so my first impressions were all relative. 
* You go to your floor, and they have the nicest corridors, wallahi. It's better than many 5-star hotels
* They gave me a room tucked in the corner of the hotel. It had a private entrance with a sofa facing two rooms at an angle. 

**I walked in saying Bismillah and had a mixed reaction**. 

* Rooms are quite big. The one I got was bigger than many quad rooms that I've seen. It's quite spacious. 
* Washrooms are very spacious, all have a modern design, the jet spray is nice and powerful, there's hot water 24/7, and all the limited, or let's just say essential, amenities are all there. 
* The room was exactly like the pictures. 
* So I'd grow to like the room, but that wasn't my initial reaction. 
* The room had a lot of dust. I guess it had been vacated long ago, and the housekeeping wasn't informed I was getting the triple room, but it's always good practice to give a final check before appointing to your guest. 
* There was a lot of construction work going on outside (nothing they can do about), and the constant drilling noise can be a bit irritating.
* Tho they have a good sound proof windows and curtain, it still manages to peak in. 
* The shower faucet was broken, but I used the hand shower and set it up, still cutting them a slack, and it also had a lot of dust on it.  I wasn't really thrown off, but I kept telling myself, remember what you paid. 
* I walk out, and though there are buses, me wanting to go to Jabal Omar, I didn't take them. 
* Crossed the road to head to Haram, and no one was willing to come (as I said earlier). 
* The hotel buses are also not that frequent. They take a while to come, as the drop is very far, especially after the introduction to the beautiful Masaar line. They drop you at Jabal Kabah, which is a trek to reach the Haram and a trek to come back to the station. Solid NO.

**Quick tangent about housekeeping.**

* Know that they are overworked and have long, stressful hours. Cut them some slack.
* Go with the mindset of giving 10‚Äì20 SAR to the housekeeping every other day during your trip. Keep them in good terms, talk nicely and gently with them, don't boss around, and engage with them with some banter.
* One of the hotels I lived (not going to name) had 450 rooms checking out one night, with them being worked extra 3 hours until late at night with no holiday that week, and when I asked him if they would be paid any compensation, he said no.
* Khayr, do this, and they will be a breeze and take good care of your room while you are there. Did the same here, and the guy was really nice.

**A couple of days passed, and I started to like my time there.**

* Taxi hack: Take a taxi from across the road to the Umm Al Qura bridge for 5 SAR, and then from there to the Haram for 5 SAR. People are more willing to do that. Make sure you confirm 5 SAR before getting on. They have no way to bargain with you, coz you are getting off at a very close distance. Don't go for 10 SAR.
* After a long day at the Haram, I walked into my room and was pleasantly surprised .. it had been thoroughly cleaned, the bathroom, and the bedsheets freshly changed. Turns out, the ‚Äúclean my room‚Äù sign actually means something here. For the price I‚Äôm paying, I wasn't expecting that. 
* And I walked in with that sight every day. 
* The beds were not at all comfortable, so I resorted to sleeping down, and the room, being spacious, had enough space to sleep comfortably. 
* The AC and controls are quite modern and balance out very well. 
* The tap + shower has hot and cold water 24/7. 
* The lifts are always on time, and they have plenty of them at different directions of the hotel. 
* The hotel has one of the nicest Musallah areas. It‚Äôs very big, stretches the entire floor. The carpets are soft and elegant, and they have a mic system for adhan and salah. 
* The view faces the clock tower, which is a lovely sight. 
* Across the road is the Saver Special Market, where you get a lot of what you can buy from Bin Dawood and elsewhere for a very cheap price.
* Just next to your hotel is a modest baqala and laundry guy who charges only 3 SAR to wash per item.
* Behind them is a good cafeteria. And near the hotel is a very good Bukhari/shawarma restaurant. 
* They have a caf√© near the reception with reasonable prices for coffee. For instance, the cappuccino was only 8 SAR. 
* The shops in the reception also sell things that you can find near the Haram for far less prices. A tasbeeh cost me 3 SAR vs. 15 SAR near the Haram. 
* I tried their breakfast for 35 SAR one day, which is quite generous, only if you paid directly when booking your room. It comes down to around 15‚Äì20 SAR per person, which is a steal for what they are offering.
* Uber and careem did arrive once or twice, but because of the detours, 12 SAR would jump to 19 SAR.

Overall, it's worth giving it a shot. I got it for 92 SAR which is honestly a steal, but I'd give 3 points by musalli a shot before considering this. ",3,1744995009.0,Umrah,0,1.0,False

I live in Bogota and can only brew at max 90 degrees due to the elevation.  I have tried messing around with ratios and grind size but just can't get the aeropress right.

I believe almost all coffee companies here roast medium and I only know of one roaster who does light for whatever that matters.

I did not know ki Kota me hote h open mic. And it was my first open mic as an audience and as a performer. Such a supportive audience- you can do poem, standup, storytelling, song or anything else. 

You can give it a try, if you write anything. I do not know next kab hoga...but yeah worth worth trying. Plus cafe vibe and people were also really good!! Host was very kind and accommodative

  
Edit- People asked about tickets- its just 80 Rs- and they give you tea/coffee/ cold drink also. Very nominal. 

Also winner gets some prize too- todays winner got 2 movie tickets so win win. 

LOVED IT! 

P.S. I  went there to heal and share my recent heartbreak in a storytell- I did not know I would feel so  better after putting it out in open.  OP is happy hehe!! I minted 2 movie tickets out of a toota dil lol (not funny haha)

But honestly I am thankful to  the person who broke my heart (not his fault, he is broken too) that I got to know that I have a writing flair in me too, because before him I never wrote. So thanks to him!

After spending several hundred dollars on each of the last repairs, I can‚Äôt stomach another repair that will have effectively doubled the cost of the machine as they‚Äôre happening too often.

I‚Äôve decided to replace it as it‚Äôs getting old anyways. I‚Äôm torn between a new espresso machine or keeping it simple/convenient and going Nespresso OL.

Where I‚Äôm focused is justifying cost. I could do up to $1000 USD which I know would get me a great espresso machine and grinder, but my lifestyle currently means I only typically make one coffee at home a day before I leave, and maybe 2-3 on weekends.

Am I wrong to think it would take so long for the savings on beans to make up any cost difference and that the quality difference at my price point would make a proper espresso machine a waste of money?

Whatever your verdict, would appreciate recommendations on machine as well!",3,1744994441.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I am looking for a beta reader to read the first act of my novel Group Therapy. Fans of novels such as Normal People by Sally Rooney and Girl, Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen will enjoy this novel.

  
**Content warning**: This novel deals with themes of mental illness and **suicide**. 



Blurb: A Masters student at an elite university in New York City, Daniela is put on a leave of absence from her work, and from her life, when she is placed in a psychiatric ward for suicide ideation. After spending two months in a psychiatric unit, Daniela finds herself in an Intensive Outpatient Program where she is forced to confront her own self harm and suicidal tendencies. This program is hard work. Attempting to learn the new set of skills given to her by these doctors makes Daniela feel like a newborn fawn, all wobbly legs.¬†

Afraid of being rejected from her friends and coworkers and ashamed of her own actions, Daniela keeps her suicidality and hospitalization a secret from everyone except for Sydney Sokolov, her PhD coworker and the man who supported her transition into the hospital. Now, doing IOP in the mornings and working at a coffee shop in the afternoons, she attempts to uphold a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù appearance to the outside world. ¬†But this is a tall order for a strung out Daniela; now diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, she fights to quell the extreme mood swings which constantly test her ability to keep a grip on her life. Fucking up at work, fighting with her best friend Madeline who is increasingly suspicious of Daniela‚Äôs strange behaviors, and receiving questioning in IOP from her fellow patients, become the norm. ¬†¬†

But the program isn‚Äôt all bullshit. Through its six week duration, Daniela oscillates between an urgency to keep herself alive and resigning herself to the base instinct of dying. This struggle between fighting for her life and giving into suicide is exacerbated when she falls in love with Sydney. Quickly making deep and emotionally resilient relationships in group therapy and with Sydney, Daniela gets caught between these two worlds; seeing life as either a beautifully sensory world she can reach towards, and a dark and painful emptiness that she must run from.

In this emotional coming of age story, Daniela learns to reach towards life instead of running away from it, embracing it for all it‚Äôs good and its bad, the pain with the beauty, and all.¬†¬†

1k29c40,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k29c40/there_go_young_men_down_the_patter_trail/,There go young men down the Patter Trail,"My wife was watching a TikTok video at the kitchen table. I poured myself a cup of coffee and joined her. I wasn‚Äôt paying too much attention, but something in the back of my mind itched. Something was wrong. I looked up from my coffee and scratched my beard.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that you‚Äôre watching?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúLauren‚Äôs bachelorette party,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt was this weekend. I forgot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre they doing?‚Äù

She handed over the phone. I saw these young women walking down an old road. They were singing and tearing at their dresses, messing up their perfectly sculpted hair. Then at the edge of the clip, you see a man by the side of the road.

My heart skipped a beat. I couldn‚Äôt stop my hand from shaking. I hadn‚Äôt felt that in a while.

¬†

A second part. They‚Äôre standing with the man. The video is blurry. They‚Äôre singing with him. Celebrating. Together they lean into the camera, yelling at the top of their lungs.

*""There go young men down the Patter Trail!*

*Down the Patter Trail!*

*Down the Patter-ing Trail!*

*There go young men down the Patter Trail!*

*And one ain‚Äôt coming back!‚Äù*

¬†

They were laying on the accent thick. Dancing a little. Swaying side to side drunkenly, wrapping their arms around the strange man. They sing the tune again, and by the end of the video, I hear a casual remark.

‚ÄúI enjoy the company,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúNot so much your fellows.‚Äù

The camera pans. There‚Äôs an ice spreading in the pit of my stomach, turning the coffee sour and heavy. The camera stops on a face that I hadn‚Äôt seen for almost 20 years.

I put the phone down, walked over to the kitchen sink, and threw up. I don‚Äôt remember curling up on the floor, bawling my eyes out like a wailing child ‚Äì but I did. I had a panic attack; my first in over a decade.

¬†

I ought to give some context. I‚Äôm not the kind of man to break down for nothing. But if you‚Äôd been where I‚Äôd been, you‚Äôd do the same.

Many years ago, I lived in a small town west of Waco. If you reach Meridian, you‚Äôve gone too far.

I was blessed with a lot of friends growing up. There was Norman, the quiet kid. Gerald was from a religious home. And Tom, well, he was just happy to be there. We‚Äôd been four peas in a pod since kindergarten. Watching the same shows, playing the same games. Despite all that would happen, I‚Äôll never stop counting that blessing. So many folks never get to have what we had; an honest to God bond.

When we got to high school, things started to change. Not a lot, but in big ways. Norman wasn‚Äôt so quiet no more. Gerald got deep into history and social studies. And Tom, I suppose, was still just happy to be there. We were still the best of friends. Some would consider us brothers. We were closer than most of our families, for better or worse.

But our plans were pulling us apart. That‚Äôs just the way things happen sometimes.

We knew that after high school, we were all heading our separate ways. Norman was joining the army. Gerald was going to law school. I was gonna get a degree in electrical engineering. Tom was sticking around to take over his old man‚Äôs convenience store. The gang was splitting up for the first time ever, and no matter how jaded our teenage boy hearts were, we knew deep down that things wouldn‚Äôt be the same.

But we weren‚Äôt gonna say any goodbyes without getting outrageously drunk.

¬†

It was a beautiful summer. The same old birds, singing the same old songs. The dry grass coming alive under the sinking sun. We knew we were gonna get eaten alive by mosquitoes, but we didn‚Äôt care. Norman‚Äôs older brother got us two bottles of vodka and a couple of six packs.¬† Gerald dug out his old Nintendo 64. We hadn‚Äôt touched that thing since we were kids. I mean, we still were, but we weren‚Äôt old enough to notice.

All we had were Kiss albums. We blasted them on repeat. We were playing Goldeneye and arguing whether Psycho Circus was the shittiest Kiss album or not. Tom was off in the corner keeping the music going, drunker than a short man doing a handstand in a wine barrel.

We took shots, sang, and played until we didn‚Äôt know who we were. We decided to take a walk back to my place to get some beef jerky. Somewhere along the road, we took a wrong turn.

¬†

Now, I‚Äôve gone down that road a thousand times. And I can swear on every fiber of my being that there is no possible way for a man to get lost along that road. But somehow, by some unholy intervention, we did.

I remember Norman tripping over his feet, and we having to pull him out of a ditch. Looking up, the road wasn‚Äôt straight anymore. It curved around a bend, tipping downwards into a dark patch covered by desert willows. The asphalt gave way to a patted-down dirt trail. I figured we‚Äôd taken a wrong turn somewhere, but I couldn‚Äôt make out where. I actually laughed. I‚Äôd never been so drunk that I‚Äôd taken a wrong turn off a straight road before.

Coming around the bend, we noticed this rickety wooden house. You could barely see it in the shade. It was old, like something out of a Western. As light trickled in through the canopy, we saw a Bison skull hanging over the front door. And beneath it was an old man, eyeing us curiously from a distance.

¬†

I think I was the only one who noticed him at first. The others were heading straight down the path. I stopped for a moment, meeting the old man‚Äôs gaze. He had an old-fashioned black duster on with a high collar going all the way up to his chin. Stripey white hair running down his shoulders.

I figured he was just some old man, living his best life. I didn‚Äôt want to bother him. We‚Äôd keep going and we‚Äôd find our way back sooner or later. But Norman caught me looking and held up an arm.

‚Äú‚ÄôScuse me!‚Äù he called out. ‚ÄúYou know where we at?‚Äù

¬†

The old man got up from his rocking chair and smiled at us, resting his hands on his hips.

‚ÄúYou gon‚Äô down the Patter Trail,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt you old enough to read?‚Äù

We looked at one another. No one had heard of it, and we‚Äôd lived there our whole lives.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be on our way, sir‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThank you kindly.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo you ain‚Äôt.‚Äù

Before we could say anything, I heard a click. The old man was holding a revolver. An impeccable six-shooter. I could see the gleam all the way from the road. He had a steady hand, and a steadier eye. He didn‚Äôt blink, and his tired smile never faded.

‚ÄúHow ‚Äòbout you young gentlemen step right up, and I‚Äôll teach you somethin‚Äô.‚Äù

¬†

We had to prop up Tom; he could barely stay on his feet. The old man wasn‚Äôt taking no for an answer. I barely understood what was going on and figured he was just some cranky loner on a power trip. I‚Äôd met his kind before. I didn‚Äôt take my eyes off the gun, but you gotta remember ‚Äì the gun is just a tool. What you really ought to keep your eyes on is the man.

‚ÄúStomp your foot,‚Äù he said, pointing the gun at Gerald. ‚ÄúStomp. Go on.‚Äù

Gerald did as he was told, stomping on the wooden deck until he found a rhythm. Then the old man turned to me.

‚ÄúYou. Clap.‚Äù

I clapped. Norman and Tom couldn‚Äôt contribute. That they were even conscious to begin with was nothing short of a miracle.

¬†

The old man started humming a tune.

‚ÄúThere go young men down the Patter Trail,‚Äù he sang. ‚ÄúDown the Patter Trail. Down the Patter Trail‚Äù.

He pointed his gun at us. With every syllable, it bobbed to another person.

‚ÄúThere go young men down the Patter-ing Trail‚Ä¶‚Äù

Norman. Me. Tom. Gerald.

‚ÄúAnd one, done lost, his mind‚Äù

Gerald.

Norman.

Click.

¬†

Norman dove for cover, leaving Tom face down on the wooden deck. We all collapsed away from one another, scrambling for shelter. All except Tom, who was too drunk to get back up.

We ran. Norman headed into the desert willows. I headed straight into the field. Gerald went down the road. It‚Äôs one of those moments where you can‚Äôt think straight, and every ‚Äúshould‚Äù and ‚Äúought to‚Äù runs out the back of your head. You don‚Äôt think ‚Äì you just do. He was armed, and we weren‚Äôt. We didn‚Äôt stand a chance.

‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt no bad man!‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt ¬†evil! No children! No women!‚Äù

¬†

I looked back from a distance. I could see him dragging Tom by the hair like a trophy hunt. Tom swatted at his hand, but it was useless. The old man kept yelling into the night.

‚ÄúWhen a young man pitter-patters down my trail, I‚Äôll make sure he done lose his mind!‚Äù

He raised his revolver again, resting it against Tom‚Äôs temple. He pulled the trigger, sending the songbirds fleeing into the sky. Dread settled in my gut, sending a burning ice into my veins. It was the moment I realized that behind all the rules and courtesies we‚Äôve painted our lives with, there‚Äôs nothing but promises to keep a man from shooting you in the head.

‚ÄúLook!‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúHe done lost his mind, son! He done *lost* his *mind!*‚Äù

I stumbled my way into the night, praying I‚Äôd find a familiar road before the next gunshot went off. I could hear singing in the distance, growing fainter. And when the sun finally rose, an eternity later, I was blacked out by the side of the road ‚Äì my eyes red with tears, and my tongue as dry as sand.

¬†

Everyone was out looking for Tom the next day. But there was no such thing as the Patter Trail, and no one had heard about an old house with a Bison skull. There were search parties, interviews, posters plastered all over town ‚Äì but it got us nowhere. Tom‚Äôs parents pleaded to the newspapers. Others blamed the three of us. The police thought we‚Äôd done something stupid and decided to blame it on a made-up boogeyman. I was interrogated four separate times, telling the same story over and over. At every turn we were attacked, questioned, and disbelieved.

Even our own families started looking at us differently. There were the late-night talks.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll love you no matter what,‚Äù my mom would whisper as she touched my hair. ‚ÄúI just need you to be honest with me.‚Äù

She meant well, but she didn‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôd never told her a lie, and she couldn‚Äôt believe it.

¬†

Norman kept true to his word and joined the army. Gerald moved away to study law. I moved even further away. Every time we got together, people were giving us this look; like they tried to see right through us ‚Äì not knowing there was nothing to see. But that didn‚Äôt stop them from trying. It‚Äôd all turned into this infested rumor that we couldn‚Äôt get away from. There were no more ‚Äògood mornings‚Äô from the neighbors. No ‚Äòhave a nice day‚Äô from the cashier. At best, we got nods and frowns.

So there was nothing left to keep us around. Not even each other. So we went our separate ways, hoping to leave it all behind.

¬†

That morning by the kitchen table, when I heard that chant, it all came back to me. 20 years in the making. The desert willows, the dirt road, and that all-too familiar tune. But Lauren and her bachelorettes hadn‚Äôt gone missing ‚Äì they were fine, if a bit hung over.

But the man in the picture wasn‚Äôt old, and he wasn‚Äôt pointing a gun at anybody.

It was Tom, not a day older than we last saw him.

¬†

When I calmed down, I looked up Norman and Gerald. I hadn‚Äôt talked to them in years. It took some time to even find them, and Gerald had set his socials to private. But by a friend of a friend, a bit of luck, and stubbornly refusing to back off, I managed to send them both a link to the video.

After that, things went quiet. I would stay by the computer, pressing update in my browser. But nothing would happen. A part of me was relieved ‚Äì maybe they‚Äôd moved on. Maybe I was the problem. But it didn‚Äôt last.

Late one night, I got a call from an unknown number. But I answered, and I‚Äôd recognize Norman‚Äôs voice any day, at any time.

‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù he sighed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know it ain‚Äôt,‚Äù I said.

There was a long pause as he deflated on the other side. I could hear ice clinking in a glass.

‚ÄúYeah. I know.‚Äù

¬†

Norman was married. Had two kids. He‚Äôd been deployed overseas, and brought back a changed perspective. Gerald, on the other hand, was practicing law upstate, living on his own. He‚Äôd left the church the moment he got away from his family.

We all got together in a chat. I wanted us to catch up, but it was harder than expected. We didn‚Äôt have a lot in common anymore. Norman and Gerald were opposites on the political spectrum, and our lives looked very different. But no matter how fast our small talk died, the real issue remained. The Patter Trail was out there. Despite what everyone had told us, that night had happened.

We couldn‚Äôt figure out how Tom could be in that video. It didn‚Äôt make any sense. We‚Äôd seen what happened to him. And those of us who hadn‚Äôt seen it had, at the very least, heard it.

¬†

We‚Äôve told different stories over the years. It‚Äôs easy for people to understand ‚Äòmurder‚Äô, so that‚Äôs usually all I‚Äôve said. It‚Äôs harder to understand the Patter Trail. Hell, none of us really understood it. On paper, it didn‚Äôt make sense. Lauren and her bachelorettes had been celebrating somewhere up near Amarillo, while we used to live near Waco. There was no way for our two groups to stumble on the same trail that far apart. We had a group chat and kept coming back to the same issue over and over again.

‚ÄúI think we gotta face the facts,‚Äù said Norman. ‚ÄúThat whatever this is, it‚Äôs not normal.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing for something not to be normal,‚Äù said Gerald. ‚ÄúAnd another thing entirely to be supernatural.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs suggesting that,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúHe could‚Äôve moved.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd stayed the same for 20 years?‚Äù Norman asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not buying it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo we even know that‚Äôs Tom?‚Äù Gerald asked. ‚ÄúAre we sure about that?‚Äù

But we were sure. We‚Äôd never stopped seeing his face in our nightmares. I could pick his voice out in a crowd of thousands. There was no doubt in my mind, and I could tell the others felt the same. We might have turned into very different people, with very different lives, but we couldn‚Äôt change what we knew to be true.

‚ÄúI think we need to meet up,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe need to do something.‚Äù

¬†

It took some time to arrange. Norman‚Äôs wife wasn‚Äôt keen on him leaving her alone with the kids. He‚Äôd told her about having seen one of his best friends get shot when he was younger, but how that translated into him having to leave 20 years later didn‚Äôt sound right. He had a family to care for ‚Äì he couldn‚Äôt be out chasing murderers. But Norman couldn‚Äôt help it. I think he blamed himself for leaving Tom behind all those years ago.

Gerald, on the other hand, had little holding him back. Not even a cat to feed. But he‚Äôd painted himself this perfectly balanced life where everything had a note on his calendar, and everything was perfectly predictable. He had new friends, in a new town, and they expected him to be places. It must‚Äôve been painful for him, making space for old grudges in his sparkling new calendar app.

I had to tell my wife about this. She wanted to go with me, but I couldn‚Äôt let her. I‚Äôd lost Tom all those years ago, and I never recovered. Losing her would end me. She knew about my past, and having lost a friend of mine. We‚Äôd talked about it. But I‚Äôd never told her about the Patter Trail. How could I?

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut if I can‚Äôt come, you gotta do one thing for me.‚Äù

We‚Äôd been arguing for hours. We were tired, both physically and emotionally. She wandered off to the basement, and returned with a gun. She put it down on the table. I didn‚Äôt even know we had one.

‚ÄúYou have to take this,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going anywhere near a killer, even with the police just minutes away, you‚Äôre taking this. And you‚Äôre calling me every day.‚Äù

It was non-negotiable. Bless her heart.

¬†

I met Norman and Gerald in Waco for the first time in decades. It was only a fast stop, but we had dinner together before headed west. Gerald talked about civil law. Norman talked about immigration. Gerald ordered a vegetarian dish. Norman had the veal. I settled for the fish and kept my mouth shut.

We made our way west in separate cars. We followed the same roads, took the same exits, and drove past the same gas station. After a while, the roads started to look familiar. Muscle memory kicked in. And before we knew it, we were looking down a street where we‚Äôd played as kids.

Norman‚Äôs brother still lived in town, so we had a place to stay. We parked, small-talked for a little bit, and retreated to the garage.

¬†

Once the doors were closed, we sat down on some cheap sun-tanned plastic garden furniture. There was a wobbly white plastic table with a jar of cigarette buds. Norman had already lit a cigarette, and Gerald was visibly annoyed, fake coughing out some passive aggression. We heard Norman‚Äôs brother wish us a good night from the other room as he wandered off, and the conversation settled.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no point in wandering around,‚Äù said Norman. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve combed through every inch of this place over and over. There‚Äôs no Patter Trail.‚Äù

‚ÄúAgreed,‚Äù said Gerald. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt have walked more than an hour, two at most. It‚Äôs impossible.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo we all agree to that?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThat we‚Äôre dealing with something impossible?‚Äù

Norman snuffed out his cigarette and nodded.

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

¬†

When dealing with something impossible, you can‚Äôt expect things to make sense based on rational thought. The gloves are off. There are new rules. And you gotta make do with what you got.

Norman had a shotgun and a box of buckshot. Gerald was a pacifist and refused to carry a weapon. I ended up somewhere in the middle with the handgun my wife gave me. Of course, if this was really Tom, we‚Äôd have no need for any kind of weapon in the first place, but I refused to go unprepared. Norman agreed.

We discussed what we ought to do. Gerald suggested firing up the old game console, hoping that might be the trigger. I suggested putting on Kiss albums. Norman, on the other hand, dug out his brother‚Äôs tequila stash.

¬†

Things didn‚Äôt really pan out the way they did back when we were teenagers. Gerald was careful with his drinking. Norman was too busy telling stories from his deployment. I kept nodding off ‚Äì alcohol makes me sleepy nowadays. So sure, we got tipsy, and it was nice to catch up, but we got nowhere near the Patter Trail.

Somewhere around 2 am, we decided to wander a bit. I kept yawning, and Norman had turned from happy drunk to angry drunk. Gerald had hit a quasi-intellectual better-than-thou kind of drunk. We didn‚Äôt get to the end of the street before the two of them were at each other‚Äôs throats, yelling at one another to the point where they woke up the neighbor‚Äôs dog.

There was some pushing. Some accusations. Norman threw around the word ‚Äúspineless‚Äù a lot. Gerald settled for ‚Äúidiot‚Äù. I just asked them to shut the hell up.

¬†

We didn‚Äôt get very far that night. I ended up sleeping in my car. Norman curled up in a sleeping bag on the garage floor. Gerald went inside the house and crashed on the couch.

The next day, we were hung over, disheartened, and annoyed. Mostly with each other, but with ourselves as well. I think we all considered ourselves idiots to even be there to begin with. We‚Äôd been roped in by some idea that we could settle a score from decades ago. Like we were some kind of action heroes.

After a long and quiet breakfast, we ended up at the same weathered table out in the garage. Norman broke the silence.

‚ÄúI think about it a lot,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know y‚Äôall blame me for dropping Tom. That‚Äôs on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs blaming you, damnit,‚Äù said Gerald. ‚ÄúNever did. The man had a gun on you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI *held* him,‚Äù Norman continued. ‚ÄúHe trusted me. And I dropped him.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was that or getting shot,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt had no choice.‚Äù

Norman shook his head. Gerald put a hand on his shoulder. I could hear a crack in Norman‚Äôs voice as he closed his eyes.

‚ÄúI could‚Äôve done something,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúI could‚Äôve.‚Äù

¬†

We spent the day going around town, seeing some acquaintances. We checked out our childhood homes. Mine had been sold years ago. Gerald‚Äôs had been abandoned. We walked by our old school, checking out our hangout spots. Some of the marks we‚Äôd made were still there. An (N + R) carved into a wooden beam from when Norman had a crush on Ramona. A spray-painted ‚ÄúGerald is king‚Äù from when he won our Mario Kart tournament.

And there, on the edge of the bench where we used to read comics, was the most painful text of all.

‚ÄúTom was here.‚Äù

¬†

We figured we‚Äôd give it another shot. Even if we couldn‚Äôt make sense of it, we could at least get wasted. So that night, Gerald put away his glasses. I put on ‚ÄòPsycho Circus‚Äô, and Norman put his hair up with a fancy red tie. We raised our glasses to Tom, over and over. We sang. We complained. And in a way, we even found things to agree on. Somewhere around the fourth shot, the lines in the sand started to get a bit blurry.

This was feeling less like a rescue and more like a farewell party. Somewhere around the sixth shot, Norman and I started talking about our wives, and Gerald took the opportunity to go outside for a piss.

By the sixth shot, we realized he hadn‚Äôt come back.

¬†

We had another shot and got our guns. Norman had taken a few too many and kept wobbling back and forth. Now, I don‚Äôt trust a drunk with a gun, but I trusted Norman. The only thing steady with him was his aim.

We walked around, looking for Gerald. We couldn‚Äôt find him. Norman shook his head.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt look for him,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat don‚Äôt work. We just gotta go.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo where?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust go.‚Äù

With a bottle each, we pointed in a random direction, and just started walking.

¬†

Somewhere along the path, we started humming that tune. It was still there, buried in the back of our minds.

‚ÄúThere go young men down the Patter Trail‚Ä¶‚Äù

We might not be that young anymore, but we were heading down that same trail nonetheless. Singing it took away its power. Made it feel real. It was us challenging something we didn‚Äôt understand, and we bellowed out the words in a whiskey-tinted scream.

And before long, we heard Gerald in the distance, joining in the song.

¬†

We didn‚Äôt even notice the path turning into patted-down dirt. There were no houses behind us. We could see the road bending downward into a thicket of desert willows ahead. Gerald waved at us from further down the road, stumbling over his own feet. He came up to us, his speech slurred.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a house,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBison skull an‚Äô all.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúSure as shit.‚Äù

He had the hiccups, so Norman handed him a bottle. Gerald eagerly accepted the offer. Together we followed the trail.

¬†

Norman checked his shotgun. I checked my pistol. As we rounded the corner, we could see the old wooden house with the bison skull. There was an empty rocking chair out front. We all stopped and stared at it. It was there. It was really there.

Norman raised his shotgun.

‚ÄúCome on out!‚Äù he yelled. ‚ÄúOr we‚Äôre coming in!‚Äù

It was quiet. A couple of seconds passed, then there was a noise. Something moved inside the house. I turned off the safety on my gun, but kept my finger off the trigger. I‚Äôd handled a firearm before, but I also knew in my heart of hearts I was in no condition to use it well.

An old man with stripey white hair emerged.

¬†

We didn‚Äôt know what to say. It was him. He didn‚Äôt look a day older. The same high-collar duster. The same revolver. The air turned so quiet I could hear my heart beat out of my chest.

‚ÄúAin‚Äôt young men no more,‚Äù said Gerald. ‚ÄúYou still gonna make us sing?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo me, you‚Äôre all still very much young men,‚Äù the old man said. ‚ÄúSeems more than one of y‚Äôall lost his mind for you to wander back on my property.‚Äù

Norman wasn‚Äôt having this conversation. In the corner of my eye, I saw him steadying his shotgun, and before I knew it, he pulled the trigger; turning the old man‚Äôs head into a cascade of red.

¬†

But something wasn‚Äôt right.

The body didn‚Äôt fall over. Instead, it raised its revolver at us. Gerald pushed Norman out of the way and threw himself on the ground. I followed suit. A gunshot rang out, kicking up a dust sprite as it hit the ground between us. The old man had half his head splattered on the wall behind him, but was still standing. Without as much as a change of posture, he walked back into his house and closed his door.

I got up off the ground and rushed over to the others. They were okay. At least physically. Norman kept muttering ‚Äòwhat the fuck‚Äô under his breath over and over, and Gerald looked like he was having a panic attack.

‚ÄúWe gotta keep going,‚Äù I wheezed. ‚ÄúWe gotta keep going.‚Äù

¬†

We rushed up to the house. I heard this strange crackling noise, followed by a deep cough. There was a new voice coming from inside.

‚ÄúYou boys got me, I‚Äôll give you that.‚Äù

Norman and Gerald positioned themselves on the side of the door. Norman pointed at the handle and counted down. Gerald kept shaking his head. As Norman‚Äôs count hit zero, Gerald opened the door, and Norman stepped up.

He took the shot.

¬†

On the other side of the room was a stranger with a buckshot in his left shoulder. A man in his early 50‚Äôs. Overweight, with a trucker cap and sizable sideburns. Still wearing that same duster, although he couldn‚Äôt keep it closed.

The place was old, and everything was seemingly hand-made. No wallpaper, just raw wood. A kitchen with a cast iron stove and neatly stacked firewood. A bed made with straw. Knives, saws, hammers, rasps and files across the wall. No decorations, apart from the taxidermied head of a goat on the wall. ¬†There was a chunk of flesh and stringy white hair on the floor.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Tom?‚Äù Norman asked. ‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat how you treat your elders?‚Äù the man grinned.

Norman clicked his shotgun open and put in two new buckshots. The man with the trucker cap was about to raise his revolver, but I managed to kick it out of his hand. He sighed.

‚ÄúThere go young men down the Patter Trail,‚Äù he sing-songed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how it goes.‚Äù

¬†

Norman wasn‚Äôt playing around. He put another two shots in him, painting the wood a bloodstained red. The tools on the wall clinked, and my ears rang from the blast. This time the man stopped moving, but Norman wasn‚Äôt done. He clicked the shotgun open, loaded another two buckshots, and emptied it again. He wasn‚Äôt happy until this monster was minced meat.

Norman sat down, panting. Gerald gave him a pat on the shoulder, as I looked around. There was a bedroom, and a cellar. A little garden out back, and a drying rack. I called Gerald over.

‚ÄúNorman, yell if he moves.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll just keep shooting him,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù

¬†

We wandered down into the cellar. The earth was cold. Cold enough for us to see our breaths. What little light we had from above disappeared about ten steps in, so Gerald used a lighter. He must‚Äôve stolen it from Norman when he wasn‚Äôt looking.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt want him to keep smoking,‚Äù Gerald smirked.

I could barely see a thing, but I could tell it was a small room. We could stand upright, and there was no echo. We continued forward, only for me to touch something with my foot. I waved Gerald over, and as the light stretched out in front of me, I lost my breath.

Heads. Floor to ceiling. Stacks of heads.

¬†

Young men. Old men. Middle-aged men. All ages, creeds, and colors. Long hair, short hair, no hair. Dead, severed, heads. I‚Äôd tapped the lip of a man with fair and well-combed hair, his gray eyes half-closed and staring into nothing.

Seeing something like that is beyond overwhelming. You know it‚Äôs gonna stay with you for the rest of your life. You know you‚Äôre not going to forget it. It burns into you, and opens some kind of feeling like you‚Äôve never had before. I just backed away, shaking my head. I just kept saying ‚Äòno‚Äô over, and over, and over. I didn‚Äôt want this in my mind. I didn‚Äôt want to have to think of this.

Gerald grabbed me by the arm and pulled me out of it. We went back upstairs, finding Norman still on the floor with a bottle. The man he‚Äôd shot hadn‚Äôt moved a muscle. Norman looked up at us.

‚ÄúNo Tom?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the hell that was.‚Äù

¬†

I sat down, trying to calm myself. Gerald started checking drawers and closets. Norman waved his bottle around, giving drunken suggestions.

He didn‚Äôt look away for long. Maybe a couple of seconds. But that‚Äôs all it took.

The dead man inched his hand toward the revolver, and in a snap, he pulled it up and fired ‚Äì striking Norman in his upper chest.

¬†

The room erupted. Gerald threw himself on the floor. I hid behind a table. Norman pulled back towards the front door, firing and reloading as fast as he could. Something blew a hole in the table, two inches off the top of my head. I could hear boards crack, and something rolled across the floor. Seconds later, there was a new voice coming from the other side of the room. A deep, hateful voice. Scornful. Every word had a texture to it, like the ridges of a saw.

‚ÄúThere go young men down the Patter-ing Trail,‚Äù it growled. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm gon‚Äô *take their heads*.‚Äù

¬†

The table was thrown across the room, crashing into the wall on the other side. I looked up to see a man with the head of a goat ‚Äì he‚Äôd taken the trophy off the wall. It wrapped an arm around my neck and pulled me to my feet, pointing a gun at my temple. I didn‚Äôt stand a chance; it was impossibly strong. I fumbled around with my gun, putting two shots in that thing before it ripped it from my hands.

I was led outside. Norman had taken cover behind a tree on the other side of the road. Gerald was still inside, hiding. The goat head had this unsettling breath. Staggered. Like it was trying to keep from getting too excited.

‚ÄúHow ‚Äòbout you put down that stick of yours, son?‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúWe could play a little. I might even let some of you go.‚Äù

Norman wasn‚Äôt about that. Cold steel pressed to my head.

‚ÄúNo?‚Äù the goat continued. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll have to play by my lonesome.‚Äù

The revolver rattled to the ground. Two impossibly strong hands settled on the side of my head.

And it began to twist.

¬†

I didn‚Äôt have time to scream and cry. It was fast, and quiet. Snap.

It‚Äôs hard to explain. You feel this sudden warmth, like your face is basking in the sun. Like you‚Äôre holding your breath, but instead of panicking, you relax. Little thoughts start to trickle out of you as you begin to forget things. For your eyes to look. For your lungs to breathe. For your heart to tick.

And then there‚Äôs nothing. You don‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre not thinking. There‚Äôs no time. No waiting. No you.

But only for a while.

¬†

My eyes opened. I was picking up my wife‚Äôs gun. My hands were stained with blood. A goat‚Äôs head lay discarded on the floor. I spoke, but it wasn‚Äôt my words. I didn‚Äôt pick them.

‚ÄúHow ‚Äòbout now?!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll play with me, huh? Or you gonna shoot me too?‚Äù

Norman was screaming from the other side of the road. Something raised my hand and compelled me to fire a round in his direction. I could feel myself laughing. I could taste old air from someone else‚Äôs lungs, slithering across my tongue.

I watched myself turn around to see Gerald. He‚Äôd come out of his hiding place. He‚Äôd found a lantern, and he still had Norman‚Äôs lighter. He was gonna burn this whole place to the ground.

‚ÄúI suggest you put that down, sir,‚Äù said Gerald. ‚ÄúAnd you better do it now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat, this?‚Äù I asked.

Then, black.

¬†

I blinked.

We were outside. I was panting. There‚Äôd been a struggle. I had gunshots across my body. Gerald was pointing my wife‚Äôs gun at me, but he lowered it as to not shoot me in the head. Norman was flanking with his shotgun, clicking it shut from a fresh reload. He must‚Äôve been on his last two shots ‚Äì his pockets were turned inside out.

‚ÄúYou can kill me a hundred different ways, but I‚Äôll keep coming,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep coming, and you‚Äôre not going anywhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is what‚Äôs gonna happen,‚Äù said Gerald. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre putting him back. We‚Äôre taking our friend. And then we‚Äôll never see each other again.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThen we‚Äôll burn your path to the fucking ground,‚Äù spat Norman. ‚ÄúTake your pick.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have another suggestion,‚Äù I said with a grin.

¬†

It turned into a blur. Gunshots. Screams. Blood. Fingers turning to claws, raking across flesh. Darkness. Flashing. Gasping. One moment I‚Äôm chasing someone across a field, the next I‚Äôm being pushed down from behind. I‚Äôm frustrated. I‚Äôm angry. But it‚Äôs not really me. Every blink of my eye could be my last, and yet, I couldn‚Äôt panic. It was no longer my heart to beat.

‚ÄúNo women!‚Äù I screamed. ‚ÄúNo children! I‚Äôm a good man! An honest man!‚Äù

I remember having a liquid thrown across my back. Gerald had taken off his coat and lit it on fire. He was running towards me.

‚ÄúDown the Patter Trail!‚Äù I screamed. ‚ÄúDown the Patter-ing Trail!‚Äú

¬†

Then nothing. I think it was longer that time, but it‚Äôs hard to tell. You don‚Äôt really count anything, or feel anything. There‚Äôs no clock on the wall. It‚Äôs nothing.

When I opened my eyes, I couldn‚Äôt move. Everything ached, and I felt a creeping hangover. Norman was looking down on me.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs up,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

They carried me on their shoulders, bloody and beaten. Gerald had claw marks across his back. Norman had been shot just beneath the shoulder. It‚Äôd gone clean through, but it was bleeding pretty bad.

And Gerald was carrying a brown paper bag.

¬†

I don‚Äôt know how long we walked. Long enough for the sun to lure on the horizon.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I wheezed.

‚ÄúI figured if he could take you apart, he could put you back together,‚Äù said Gerald.

‚ÄúHe did what?‚Äù

‚ÄúTry not to think about it,‚Äù said Norman. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre done. We‚Äôre getting out.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you get him?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Norman continued. ‚ÄúBut we got Tom.‚Äù

¬†

Tom had been dead for over 20 years. It didn‚Äôt matter if that thing could put him back together, he was too far gone. But we got his head, and we could give him a proper burial.

Somewhere out in the Texan sands, we put Tom to rest. Gerald tied a cross together with his shoelaces. We took the dry blue sunflowers from Tom‚Äôs mouth, some kind of preservative, and said our prayers quietly. Even Gerald joined in. It must‚Äôve been the first time he talked to God in 20 years.

When the sun finally rose, we could see familiar streets in the distance.

¬†

We didn‚Äôt get our friend back, but we settled a score that night. We took matters into our own hands, and we proved to ourselves that what we‚Äôd felt and seen was real. That we weren‚Äôt just some stupid kids who‚Äôd taken a wrong turn. We‚Äôd been wronged.

Maybe we‚Äôll never have proper justice for what‚Äôs been done, but at least we can find some peace. We took something back from that thing, and if we were to return, we‚Äôd bring fire. It knows that, so I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll meet again.

I don‚Äôt know if this solved anything, but it pulled us back to a place we knew. It put our names back in our phones, and gave me faces to remember. And it reminded me, again, that some bonds never break.

¬†

I got to come home to my wife with an empty gun. She was just happy that I was okay.

Now, life goes on, but sometimes when I lay down to sleep I dream of strange things. Little memories of something from beyond. Little thoughts that aren‚Äôt mine. Pictures of things to come, or things to be. Strange tastes from things I haven‚Äôt eaten.

I suppose that‚Äôs to be expected. When you‚Äôve been touched by the Devil ‚Äì he never lets go.",11,1744994273.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

i don't know where to start, because even i don't know where did i start losing myself. it started long before this, quietly like a loose thread of a sweater slowly pulling apart. i keep damaging myself and i don't know who to recover or move forward. my life is stood still. everything around me comes and goes and i stand there like this sweater slowing being pulled apart.

on 13th of april I was asleep, and my mom shook me awake and said, ""Wake up, I think Sultan is dead."" I woke up in shock. half asleep, I ran to the room, where I saw him lifeless, drooling, with one eye open. And all I could do was think was why I slept. If I hadn't slept, I could have rushed him to the vet been with him in his last moments made him comfortable. But the truth is by that point, he died alone and i didn't matter anymore anymore because all i was left with was guilt.

Let me take you back to when my cats were born. When my babies were born. on the 8th of February. something that was supposed to be beautiful memory. I couldn't be as happy for them as I wanted to, because four days prior to that, the love of my life left me. She abandoned me. And even though my cat giving birth was a beautiful thing, I couldn‚Äôt feel the joy I was supposed to. I couldn‚Äôt even smile properly. The grief was too loud. 2 days later the mother cat stopped feeding them so I stepped in. with milk replacers

I hand fed them every two hours, around the clock It kept me busy. And diverted my mind from my thoughts because I had to feed them every two hours. I stayed awake every night, all night long, just feeding them. In the day, I was asleep but waking up every two hours to feed them and also had to wake up five times a day to pray. I was maybe getting 3-4 hours of sleep a day at best . I was getting exhausted. Mentally, I was just getting messed up. I was losing myself. It wasn‚Äôt just the exhaustion. It was something deeper. I was losing my grip on reality.

It wasn‚Äôt just about the cats. If anything, my cats helped me. They were like my companions. I felt happy around them. I felt‚Ä¶ I felt great around them. I still do. It's just the fact that being in the situation that I was, I was just losing myself. I was disconnecting from reality. I was so busy doing stuff (other than my cats) doing stuff that doesn‚Äôt matter. Chores. Spending hours on them. My life felt like it had stopped. I was already fading already drowning in failures, and this huge pause in my life stretched longer than it should have. Life wasn‚Äôt moving forward. It was just‚Ä¶ sitting still. anyways slowly, the kittens started to grow. We named them Archie, Sultan, and Einstein ( called him Einie or Einnu for short ). I named them this because of one of my favorite movies, Back to the Future. I loved the name Einstein.

After that, days passed. I fed them every day. I played with them every day. They loved me, and I loved them. And it felt relieving seeing them bite my hands. They would be in the other room, and I would be asleep. My mom would open the door and they would all run to my room. Sultan would bite my hair and kick my head. He was the biggest, the healthiest. And I felt really nice. They made me feel nice. They made me feel better about my life. i felt part of a family maybe the reason i felt that is cause i'm an only child idk maybe.

But life has a cruel habit of reminding you how fragile happiness is i think all happiness, carries within it the seed of its own ending from the moment it comes into existense and just like that one day, Sultan‚Äôs tummy got upset. I gave him some Flagyl. And he was active, playing, running. Everything was great. The next morning, it got worse, so I took him to the vet. first thing when it opened cause i didn't sleep the night so i just waited for the clinic to open. He was still active at this point. The vet gave an injection for his fever, and one for his tummy.

I came home. i was with him for an hour he pooped a few times all were the upset ones but i thought the meds would kick in soon so I just thought I would sleep for a little while. And i closed my eyes the next thing i know i mom said wake up I think Sultan is dead. He‚Äôs not breathing.‚Äù I woke up in shock and ran to the other room, where I saw the result of my negligence. Still. Cold. and lifeless there was nothing I could do anymore but hold the regret of sleeping, only if i didn't sleep i would have been able to do something take it to the vet when he was near his end or maybe i could have just been with him comforting him in his final hours but he was gone....

We took him to the nearest park, where I buried him. I came home‚Ä¶ and he was just not there anymore. He passed on the 2nd of April. After Sultan, every morning felt like punishment and I didn‚Äôt know how to break free from it, whenever I would wake up with an intense heartbeat and it would feel like he was still here, and it was a dream. But it wasn‚Äôt. My baby was actually gone. and every time my mom shook me awake for breakfast, for anything I panicked. And everytime I'd think another one was gone. It became a reflex. more like a curse and i remember this happening when she left everyday id wake up with a really fast heart beat for a second feel like it was just a bad dream and check my phone and relive the fact that she really did abandon me.

And then, exactly on the 9th of April, Einie and Archie both got their tummies upset and passed blood in their stool. I took them to the vet immediately. He said‚Ä¶ he said it was most probably FPV. i was for the second time in my life afraid. the mortality rate of this virus was 90% and this is what sultan had. And you all must be wondering right now why didn‚Äôt I get them vaccinated? Well, it was because, firstly, I raised them myself. They were way smaller for their age because of not being on their mothers milk secondly i had just gotten them dewormed and third they were always a little bit sick and the vet said you can do their vaccination once they are healthy.‚Äù Because they would get sick here and there. But it‚Äôs on me. It‚Äôs my fault. I should have gotten them vaccinated whenever they felt the healthiest they would still be with me.

Anyways, We started it. It was fucking expensive. But I didn‚Äôt care. I just wanted my babies to be okay. We started treatment. Antibiotics. Drips. Vitamins. We even used blood from their father to create antibody serum. I read about the virus and I followed everything. I poured everything into saving them. I did everything by the book for their best chance of survival however my baby Einie kept losing weight. He kept losing himself. I stayed with him in the room the entire night. i never left his side. His situation was getting worse day by day. He kept vomiting, and I was just there, cleaning it, comforting him to the best of my ability

And I observed and learned that presence, even in silence, carries a great amount of weight. Even cats can feel the presence... I would leave the room, and he would vomit more. He would run around. Even though his mom and his brother were there. His mom was there because she was vaccinated, but her tummy was upset so I didn‚Äôt want to expose her to the dad. So she stayed in this room. however, when I stayed with Einie, he would vomit less. He would be calm. He would look at me occasionally. And he would just‚Ä¶ be Einie. The little cutie pie that he was my baby Einie

We then shifted him to drips. Three drips a day. He couldn‚Äôt eat or drink. He was losing himself. And I‚Ä¶ was doing everything I could for him. every drip, every injection, every moment he shut his eyes, every scream, every cry, I was there but it wasn't enough....Now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll bring myself to the last 48-72 hours I had with him. I didn‚Äôt sleep for a single second. I was with him the entire way When he slept I really wanted him to live. Because he was so loving. And I really loved him. I really loved him. I really loved him.

It broke me one day. It was 4 AM and Einie lost response to touch. I rushed him to the vet the same vet who was doing his treatment. I made them their clinic as they weren't a 24 hour service i called and called until he picked up and i made him come to the clinic and here‚Äôs what broke me. Whatever I was telling him, he was on his phone. I had a suspicion of what he was doing. And then I saw it. The vet‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt even trying. He was typing what I said into ChatGPT. Asking it how to save my boy as if i couldn't do that myself. all he did was copy paste my desperation... for a while i regretted ever bringing him to this vet but then again life and death is in gods hands not ours. he was at the point where i knew he would pass and i didn't have any money left to change the vet I had spent everything I had on these treatments. Every last penny. Every favor. Every drop of hope. That day, we got his medication done. I got home. I knew he probably wouldn‚Äôt make it through the night. I stayed. I stayed with him the entire night. He made it. The next day I got his drips. I got everything done.

I came back home. His breathing pattern changed. It felt like i was losing him, I was there cleaning every time he did peeopee or poopoo because he lost his urinary control and everything. He was slowly becoming a mess. I kept cleaning. And I was with him. somehow he made it through the night. And the next day I took him and his brother for the treatment. We got them drips, meds, everything. I came back. I cleaned him over and over. until i could not humanly keep my eyes open. ( i don't drink coffee or energy drinks ) And then I just slept a little, because I hadn‚Äôt slept in over 2 days

And as soon as I slept I shouldn‚Äôt have, but I did my mom told me to wake up. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not responding anymore.‚Äù She woke me up and before she even said anything, I was halfway across the room to him. I saw he was drenched in his own peepee and poopoo because he didn‚Äôt have control anymore. And i wasn't their to clean him and the dignity sheet under him when tho absorbed some of his mess it got on him. I told ChatGPT all his conditions. ChatGPT said these are his final moments. And I refused to believe that. I said, ‚ÄúNo, ChatGPT, no. Please tell me what to do to save him. Because I didn‚Äôt want to lose Einie he was my baby he was so loving. He slept with me. He played with me. He loved me. I loved him. I just didn‚Äôt want to let him go. i didn't want him to give up. he was at the end getting colder and colder

But he was suffering. He was suffering every time I took him to the vet. He was suffering so much. And it hurt me. It hurt me every time I saw him suffer, i wish i fucking wish i could take all his pain away i would a million times over. I prayed. And I prayed. And I kept praying. And I just asked ChatGPT to help me. It said, dry him first of all. Get him heat. get his body temp up Get him an electrolyte solution. I ran to my kitchen. I took a pan thingy. Then I kept some water on to boil so I could pour it into that bottle and keep it under him. But until it boiled, I was just getting anxious so i asked chat gbt and took him upstairs into the sunlight not direct, indirect sunlight. I ran back down. I took a pair of scissors and a towel. I dried him. I cut all the hair that had poop in it to make him comfortable. I ran back down. I made an electrolyte solution using honey and a pinch of salt. I ran back up. And I gave it slowly, putting one drop at a time on his gum. At first, he wasn‚Äôt swallowing‚Äîbut slowly, once every while, he was. So, when he swallowed it, it gave me just a tiny pinch of hope. And I held on to that.

I ran downstairs and I fell down hit my head broke my glasses but it didn‚Äôt feel painful. It felt like nothing. All I could think about was Einie. writing this i look and sound stupid but i just want to say it, I took him downstairs. I poured the hot water in the flask well not the flask, the water bottles, you know the water bottles that are for heating purposes. And then I kept giving him water. I kept cleaning him. At this point, I couldn‚Äôt even keep my eyes open not even for a bit. But I stayed up as long as I could. My body was giving out, but I stayed up cleaning him, giving him a few drops of the solution and i kepy talking to my baby telling him ""hey its gonna be okey dont you worry. you will be okey in no time and when you are we will play ill give u so many treats we will get you so many toys we will go on rides and we are gonna annoy everyone. i ekpt talking to him the entire day.

And then I could no longer stay awake. So I slept right beside him, with my finger in his paw. He was breathing really really fast. And I woke up every 10 to 15 minutes and gave him the electrolyte solution and i kept talking to him. I did this for hours. Until I woke up‚Ä¶ and I was the only one that woke up. And there I was, looking at my baby Einie, lying there lifeless. He didn‚Äôt even make a sound before going. And all I could feel was guilt. Guilt for the pain and suffering I caused him. Every time he got an injection. Every time he screamed. Every time he cried every vomit every ounce of pain. All of that guilt it just flooded in. That I did all this. I caused him all this suffering. Just for my own selfish wants. so many, so many feelings came rushing in. And I just couldn‚Äôt take it, so I cried. I know a man isn‚Äôt supposed to feel this whatever tf i was feeling But maybe I am pathetic. But I did cry. And I felt‚Ä¶ I felt alone. I felt vulnerable. I felt off. I felt rotten.

And‚Ä¶ I cleaned my tears before my mom got here. I took him to the same park as Sultan, where I buried my baby einie too and then‚Ä¶ I felt‚Ä¶ alone. Even though this wasn‚Äôt even long. I was with these kittens for less than 2 months, and I felt like I had known them for a lifetime. And I loved them. And I would have done anything for them to make them happy. But they‚Äôre gone now.

After that, I changed the vet. The new vet isn‚Äôt as expensive as the last one, because I used up a lot of money for Einie and Archie together. But even though this vet isn‚Äôt as expensive, he feels just as qualified. We‚Äôre doing everything by the book to save Archie. He‚Äôs battling FPV as i write this. He hasn‚Äôt lost any weight, but he hasn‚Äôt gained any either. And now I‚Äôll help him fight this battle And I hope he makes it. Because I love my cats. And I don‚Äôt have anything going on in my life right now‚Ä¶ except my cats. even if i did my cats are my family and for once in my life i don't want to lose i want want them to leave.

I hope Archie lives. All I can do now is pray.

when i die i want to get reunited with my friends my baby einie and sultan

If you‚Äôre reading this and got this far‚Ä¶ can you guys please pray for the health of my cats

Forget cozy vibes and warm hospitality. Grit has instead cultivated an environment that seems designed to repel human presence. Its decor leans heavily into ‚Äúunfinished basement meets existential dread.‚Äù The concrete floors are polished just enough to make every footstep echo with a sense of impending doom. The walls are blank, unadorned, and slightly off-white in a way that makes you wonder if you‚Äôre inside a gentrified holding cell.

The seating, if it can be called that, appears to have been sourced from a dystopian furniture graveyard. Metal stools teeter slightly with every movement, and back support is an abstract concept best left to the imagination. Each table is just small enough to prevent comfortable laptop use, while also somehow managing to be sticky at all times despite appearing spotless.

Comfort, clearly, is not the goal. Efficiency is. Grit Coffee doesn‚Äôt want you to stay. It wants you to grab your $6.50 cup of ‚Äúethically harvested existentialism‚Äù and immediately question every life decision that brought you here. 

The playlist reinforces this urgency. At any given time, it‚Äôs either dead silent or playing a loop of ambient noise that sounds vaguely like someone rearranging furniture upstairs. The overall ambiance whispers: This is not your home. This is not a safe space. This is where you come to remember that comfort is a capitalist illusion.


Despite this‚Äîor more likely, because of it‚ÄîGrit Coffee has achieved cult status. Patrons flock to the space precisely for its refusal to indulge the coddling norms of modern caf√© culture. It‚Äôs a haven for those who think suffering builds character, who want their lattes with a side of spiritual discomfort.

In the end, Grit Coffee isn‚Äôt just serving drinks. It‚Äôs serving a reminder: time is fleeting, joy is a distraction, and your seat was never meant to be sat in.

I have over a decade of emotions, over a decade of feeling like I've just wasted my days. Over a decade of not actually feeling loved but telling myself it's better than being abused. 



Today is a beautiful day, not too cold but not quite warm, no wind which is a contrast to yesterdays wind storm. It's early enough Im still sipping my coffee. A perfect day for yard work as my neighbors agree. They're relandscaping their property and have been for a while. I'm watching them, as us nosey neighbors do (we're all familiar and friendly) the young husband and wife, with a new baby. So cute. I remember those years. 

The husband pulls up with a small tractor. The wife, giddy, asks her husband to teach her how to use it. So he does. I'm listening, watching their interaction, sipping my coffee, and I can't help but fight back tears. Her husband is so gentle, so patient. Shes learning something entirely new to her and he's supporting her. She overcorrects the tractor and brushes into the galvanized fence, dents it pretty good but the farm life isn't an aesthetic life and they both giggle over her accident. He calmly reaches into the tiny tractor and shuts off the engine to explain to her what she did wrong. They're all smiles, she's so excited and you can tell he's falling in love with her a little more in that moment. She starts up the tractor to try again and they carry on. 

I'm angry, sad, hurt and embarrassed thinking about what it would be like if that were my husband and I. 
I'd ask him if I could try to ride the tractor. That's where our story would end because he would deny my attempt. Tell me it's too hard or that it's quicker if he just gets the work done. But for the sake of my story let's say he agrees to tech me. His demeanour is short and hostile as if teaching me is a burden. I would get a brief overview of what I need to do, if I asked questions he would answer aggressively as if I should already know the answer. Now I'm nervous, feeling like an ignorant nuisance rather than a student. So I accidentally bump into a post or hit the fence. He screams at me to shut the machine off and get the fuck out. I then sit through a 10 minute lecture about what I did wrong and why he didn't want me to ride the tractor in the first place. So I go inside the house, useless, stupid and full of mistakes. 

I can go on about actual situations in our life, as early as this morning, in the brief 5 mins we saw each other, or events that happened 12 years ago. Either way... Something has finally clicked and I want out of my marriage...I want to know what it's like to be with a gentle man who loves me.

I was quiet at first because i did not know anyone so i was not talking too much. People would come up and try to get to know me and i‚Äôd just answer and have small talk asking them about themselves. 

Moving down a month later, i got a little more comfortable and started having more conversations. I am normally a chatty person and understand some people might find that annoying and i try to be respectful of that. I sus the vibe and if the conversation flows i keep going with respect to my time and coworkers time. Most people at work are fine with me going like that and many initiate the conversations. 

There‚Äôs this one coworker who at the start was very conversational with me but in recent days seemed a little more irritated at me. I try to have small talk with her when we get tasked to do things together just so time flows quicker but i generally try not to overstep my boundaries. 

Two days ago things were going normal and we had a group of people talking while on break outside. That coworker, let‚Äôs call her Hannah was there as well. We all spoke but whenever i said something she looked down on me as if i was not worthy of being apart of that conversation. I shrugged it off as it was nothing and went on with my day. 

Later in the afternoon there was another coworker, John who i go on breaks with often. I messaged John to ask him to go for a coffee break at 2:05 as i had a task that finishes around 2pm. Hannah & John were working together on another task and i could hear Hannah shouting ‚Äúi am not gonna ask to go on break at 2:05 thats so specific and stupid‚Äù. It was as if she wanted me to hear that comment. 

Anyways, John messaged saying we should go at 2:10 instead so i said that‚Äôs fine. 
A few minutes later John messaged saying there is a meeting from 2-2:30 and they don‚Äôt want others to miss out by covering our task so him and Hannah will go at 2:30. I just said no worries and played it off as if i got busy and was gonna go at a much later time than them because it felt like they changed the time cause they did not want me to go with them. 

After that incident i just did not talk to either Hannah or John for the rest of the day and not seen them since then. 

I know this sounds stupid but i can‚Äôt help but feel self conscious and think that i have said or done something to offend Hannah and also John for that matter. I try to offer my help when they need it and check on them when they seem to be stressed or frustrated. I am thinking that on my next shift i will just not talk to either of them unless they initiate it, and only talk about work related stuff. 

Should i do anything differently?

I never thought anything was wrong with preachers and my own parents constantly quoting her writings, as if it's the Bible.  Preachers will use more Ellen White quotes than actual Bible verses.  For years I thought it was completely normal, there was a time I actually read Messages to Young People during the pandemic, I joined this Zoom group where we would study it and I actually led out a discussion on it one time.  I was 15 at the time.  Fast forward to 5 years later and I've woken up now.  

I still live with my family, meaning I have to follow these cultish beliefs as long as I am under this roof. I can't explain the whole situation, but it's going to take me a bit to get on my feet and move out, as a broke college student in this economy, plus my parents are paying for my education which is online.  I am very grateful for what they are doing for me, BUT to show my appreciation I must respect their rules and beliefs for the time being.  

Ellen White has fully convinced my parents that veganism, no coffee, and no chocolate is the way God wants us to eat.  I hate the health message so much.  Majority of these people promoting it are either fat or skinny in a very malnourished looking way.  

""The health message is the right hand of the gospel"".  Stupidest logic I have ever heard.  So basically, I don't fully have the gospel in my heart if I dont follow a woman, who was hit in the head by a rock and had only a third grade education, telling us to eat a certain way.  Mind you, this same woman was caught eating oysters, I have heard she had a problem with alcohol, and ate meat.  When I have brought that up to my parents, they quickly defend her and say that the people who wrote those things about her are bad and just hated her.  I have a hard time believing that.  

This is the other thing, Ellen White believers see the world with blinders.  If there is anything that is the opposite of what she says, even if it is something good, they won't bother to hear it and write it off as false teachings.  It's the most frustrating thing.  

I heard recently Mark Finley has been saying Ellen White is a false prophet basically.  Maybe someone here knows the full context of it, but I know some bits and pieces.  That dude Andrew Henriques, from STS, of course had to do a video on it.  My mom was watching it the other day, Randy Skeet did a sermon on it as well which my dad was watching this week as well.  Crazy.  Both of them were discussing this together, like ""can you believe he said that, about God's prophet?""  I just had to shake my head and leave.  Adventists are so hung up on stuff like this, when we have bigger problems going on in this world right now.  But at the same time, they'll scare us with Ellen White doctrines when we talk about those same problems in the world.   

Honestly, here's the thing about me.  I do not believe in Ellen White's teachings, but I still believe Saturday is the day to worship and that Jesus will be coming again to this earth.  Why? Because those are both listed in detail in the Bible.  I go by the Bible, not Ellen White.  I would follow the Leviticus things about food, since it doesn't say we need to be vegans.  I will follow everything in the Bible.  Many of you here are atheists or worship now on Sundays, I think its great you are out of the SDA cult. But for me, I still want to serve God and I love Jesus and His Word.  It's so important to me and I wish I grew up just based on the Bible and nothing more. 

So I do believe that the crazy things happening now are a sign that Jesus will be coming again, I believe God will judge us ACCORDING TO WHAT WE KNOW.  

Sometimes, I wish I was never raised an Adventist.  ",15,1744993475.0,exAdventist,8,0.94,False

Just looking for some specific day to day answers, because I‚Äôm trying to imagine the lifestyle changes and not go crazy over them.

Don‚Äôt need to reply to every question if you just want to zero in on a specific one!

1. If I‚Äôm out at a restaurant or grabbing food at a drive thru and eating in the car, can I get away with swishing with water and putting trays back in if I‚Äôm going to be back home within an hour or 2 where I can properly brush/floss?

2. Are there any foods that are ok to eat while trays are in (soft ish foods like a banana, bread, something similar), followed by a water swish?     Lunch is one thing, but during my 15 minute beaks at work, I like to have a small snack. Would be awesome if I could scarf something down without having to brush or floss during that time‚Ä¶.

3. Are any drinks (outside of HOT coffee) fine for drinking with trays in, and am I good to just thoroughly swish with water, rather than doing the whole brush routine?

4. Aside from road trips, I also like to take my time during breakfast (I usually have 2 or 3 small cups of coffee as I eat and get ready for day, so can I pop my trays back in after the eating portion is done while I sip coffee before finally doing my actual thorough morning brush routine?  I know that sounds gross to pop them back in, but again with the water swish plan. Trying to get close to the 22 hour rule as possible. If I‚Äôm sipping coffee over the course of an hour or 2, id like to minimize the time the trays are out).

5. Is cleaning the trays as simple as rinsing in water, or is there a brushing/solution routine I should be doing. How often?

6. Is the routine of removing bands from trays and placing them back on absurdly tedious?  Do they attach under or over the tray?    For people with rubber bands and braces, are they supposed to stay in while eating?

7. Do you regret Invisalign and wish you went with braces instead for a less tedious process?

I just want to know if anyone can relate to what I'm going through. I noticed this like a year ago and now I can't not make the link with caffeine as it explains so many issues I had over the years without realising what it was.

I notice that when I give up coffee and tea ( english breakfast tea, milk and sweeteners ) for a week or 2 my symptoms start to ease.

My consumption isn't even usually that bad, these symptoms can be triggered after a few days of drinking 3 or 4 caffeinated drinks a day. With tea having less caffeine.

These symptoms are:

\- Constantly going for a pee, it's like my body can't hold on to the water whatsoever. I can go multiple times in the same hour and it's a pressing urge too.

\- My facial skin and eyelids are sore, this is a big one. I'm guessing it's because of dehydration and my face not getting it's share of the water in my body.

\- My sinuses clog up. I can still breathe through the nose but they feel blocked, congested, if I sniff hard enough I can hear it and it comes with some weird indescriptible taste, smell.

\- I get weird spots, not a lot, just the occasional sore, deep spot that is painful to squeeze because there's nothing really in it. They can come about on arms or face usually, maybe neck sometimes.

\- Dehydration headaches.

\- Really dry lips like if they had no moisture at all.

I'm sure I'm forgetting some too.

I won't delve too much into the psychological ones because they are well known and common but caffeine never agreed with me mentally either definitely amplifying my anxiety and stress levels.

Can anyone relate to this and to which symptoms and how does caffeine affect you?

One of the things I loved about the smaller one was you could take the lid apart to clean every nook and cranny, so no gross old coffee smell.

The new one has a different lid. You can either use a straw or sip from it. I don‚Äôt see any way to take it apart without breaking it and when i try to pop the sliding part out it gives me resistance so I don‚Äôt wanna keep trying and break it. I‚Äôve only used it twice and it‚Äôs already got coffee gunk in spots i cant reach and is starting to smell. Soaking doesn‚Äôt help because the water just gets stuck in the same spots. The sprayer nozzle on my sink won‚Äôt reach either.

Any ideas/tips? I love the cup is but if the lid is dirty and gross I‚Äôm def not gonna keep using it üò¨ seems like a poor design choice I hate travel mugs that you can‚Äôt properly clean!!!!",3,1744993071.0,CleaningTips,1,1.0,False

So: i was 19 when this started (now 20) (m). I was planning an all nighter w my friend and at about 2-3am we made some coffee, so i drank like a liter of it, and used almost a whole puck of nicotine pouches, until i realised that i cant keep my eyes open, well i tried to go to sleep, but all of a sudden my breathing was a little bit off, and it kept getting worse, until it felt like i was gonna choke, and after that, i havent had a day without any symptoms, if i dont have acid in my throat, my breathing feels off, like i cant get enough oxygen or that i cant breath out very well, and i also cant burb, i have to force the burp out by taking a breath in and then burping, and apparently smells like fresh rubber and cologne makes my throat feel like it almost completly closed, but i dont have asthma, is it a symptom of acid reflux? I feel like im the only one with these symptoms. I just want to know if im alone on these symptoms, since i developed a habbit of overthinking because of all of this. And to add, i more likely have silent reflux, cuz i dont get the burning in my chest. I just wanna know if i should be worried about it being anything else than acid reflux‚Ä¶ i use a medication called pariet, and take bunch of vitamins",1,1744993033.0,GERD,12,0.99,False

#Boosted 2 Barista Prepared Drinks

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caff√® Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don‚Äôt like coffee and ¬£2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Steps:

* Download the Caff√® Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/8j07ZvbRhSb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caff√® Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the ‚Äúwallet‚Äù section then ‚Äúvouchers‚Äù. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

It was an accident, maybe.      
It was the softness of your smile.

It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve written a poem so I‚Äôm pretty rusty! Criticism is welcomed and appreciated! (Just be gentle, I‚Äôm kinda sensitive) 

I‚Äôm unsure about a few things, I think maybe the I love you‚Äôs aren‚Äôt needed? I write most of my poetry to be spoken so it flows aloud but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs too much just on paper? 

I‚Äôm also unsure if I‚Äôm conveying my theme clearly, I have like a really clear vision in my head of the meaning here and I‚Äôm wondering how it‚Äôs interpreted? Maybe I‚Äôll go back and revamp if I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs gotten properly. I also think I maybe need more figurative language but I‚Äôm okay with it at the present moment so idk.

First time in my adult life I've actively tried to lose weight. Was 150 last summer and went up to 175 in a few months due to some bad habits. The breaking point was all my pants no longer fit. Was pretty active as a teen but trailed off going into my early 20s. Admittedly very lazy and not a weight lifter or regular gym goer whatsoever.

Here's what I've been doing:

1.  Not eating until I've completed my 10k steps, which is usually around 4-6 PM. 
2. Only eating one meal a day along with a sweet snack after, which has averaged out to around 1100 calories. 
3. Refusing to drink calories. Been big on zero sugar soda and energy drinks. If I want coffee I'll drink it with some zero sugar vanilla creamer.



I also still eat fast food almost every day and have some kind of dessert. Chick Fil a 8 pc grilled nuggets and chicken soup is my go-to for a filling meal that is only 300 calories. 

 If I want a burger I'll go to Burger King and get a double whopper jr and some chicken fries, which together are only about 550ish calories. (shoutout to smaller sam on tik tok)



Just throwing this out there in case is wondering if it works. It definitely does and you will see results quickly as long as you stay consistent. ",5,1744992958.0,loseit,8,0.78,False
