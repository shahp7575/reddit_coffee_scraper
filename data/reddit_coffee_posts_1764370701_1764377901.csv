1p9bdl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sixflags/comments/1p9bdl0/desperately_trying_to_figure_out_all_parks_passes/,Desperately trying to figure out all parks passes and extras,"My son wants to do a month-long summer road trip to ride as many roller coasters as possible.  So we're looking at the Prestige Season Pass because it includes all 40+ parks and preferred parking (home park would be Six Flags Over GA) .  We're planning on hitting 8-10 parks so definitely worth it.  All well and good.  Pass is $145 each.

But then I went to add on the All Parks dining.  I found the ""2026 2 MEAL ALL SEASON DINING PRESTIGE - ALL PARK\* ADD-ON"".  From the description, that seems to be what I want.  That would be $160 a person.  But buried in the fine print, it says, ""**Must have a valid All Park Passport and All Season Dining on your season pass to upgrade to All Park Dining in park.""**

Does that mean I have to add the  ""2026 2 MEAL ALL SEASON DINING - PRESTIGE PASS ADD-ON"" as well (for another $79 per person)?  Do I essentially have to add 2 add-ons to the prestige pass (which comes with all park access built in) to get all-park dining?  

Also, for the drinks pass, it says that it's not valid for ""specialty"" coffee drinks.  What qualifies as ""specialty""?  Can I get something like a latte or is it basically just good for drip black coffee?  I'm not a soda drinker, so the coffee and ICEE options are make-or-break for me. 

I'm so confused.  Please help!",1,1764377827.0,sixflags,0,1.0,False

Took a chance on one of these on Ebay, nice coffee-colored one. It arrived today, and when I powered it on, all functions seemed to work. I'll need to do the usual scrubbing of the type bank, etc., but all that seems good to go. I think I'm going to enjoy using this machine!

Here's my question - when I turned it on, it powered up, and I heard the expected hum. Once I start typing, it began emitting a regular high-pitched screech/whine that basically continues until you turn the unit off. When you turn it back on, just the hum, but then once typing commences, the screech returns.

Any idea what this is, and what a fix might be?

Every year I update one part of my audio experience, either headphones, earbuds, or speakers. This year it's headphones. However I've found that I've gotten a lot pickier and walking into Best Buy to try their selection isn't cutting it now. Trying to see if I can't get some recs from people who know more than me :)

Budget - $500 (USD)
Source - Bluetooth
Requirements for Isolation - I really enjoy noise cancelling. Having it be good quality is a must. I'd also really like for the headphones to do calls well, that was a huge drawback with my last set of Bose. These would kind of be everywhere headphones for me, but I would enjoy them most at home.
Will you be using these Headphones in Public?: Yeah, sometimes
Preferred Type of Headphone - full sized
Preferred tonal balance - I'll be real, I'm not entirely sure. I think I lean towards base? I've compared Beats, Bose, and Sony, and out of those three I like Bose best. But if it's all base I'm unhappy. I just like the depth/detail. I really dislike a focus on higher tones
Past headphones - my last set was a Bose NC 700. Found it to be solid for what I needed, but I could definitely go for more detail now
Preferred Music - Includes stuff you might hear in a coffee shop, instrumentals, and punk/alt
What would you like to improve on from your set-up - I always like more detail. I enjoyed the range that my Bose had to offer in terms of tonal balance, so something similar would be good. ",1,1764377329.0,HeadphoneAdvice,1,1.0,False

Leftist. Queer. I work in a production facility for a running shoe brand. I live with my parents in a 55+ mobile home community so it gets boring here sometimes when I’m not at work, so writing postcards to my penpals is the best mental stimulation I can get. I like writing in postcards about what’s going on and about myself and making real connections with my penpals, exchanging stickers and stuff too. 

I love postcards from locations or tourist attractions with beautiful landscapes on them or a quirky tourist attraction like worlds largest egg or something like that that will make me laugh or I love art postcards or postcards with cats!

(I’m not asking this in order to flirt better or anything, I’m more just sociologically interested). Something I have been curious about recently is whether or not women are generally aware when men are staring at them in public- especially in situations where you’re stuck in close proximity for an extended period (eg. the train, coffee shop, class, etc.). It seems to me women often make a deliberate effort to not make eye contact and not attract attention from men in public (understandable, of course, given the amount of unwanted attention and harassment). I’ve noticed this in situations where a guy (myself included, in a non-excessive way (I hope)) is trying to subtly assess a woman’s interest, maybe gearing up to approach and try to flirt. Obviously it is always individualized, it is context-dependent, and we can only speculate, but I’m curious how often in general women are just not paying attention/curious to see if they are getting male attention- deliberately or not? How often are they actively avoiding it? How often do they know fully well that eyes are upon them and are pretending they are unaware to ward off approachers?",0,1764376799.0,AskWomenOver30,23,0.5,False

1p9axqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1p9axqt/what_portable_projector_suits_small_apartments/,What portable projector suits small apartments best?,"Finding the right portable projector for your small apartment can turn your cramped space into an awesome home theater. You don't need a massive living room or a dedicated media room to enjoy movies, games, and shows on a big screen.

**Why Portable Projectors Work Great in Small Spaces**

When you're dealing with limited square footage, a portable projector beats a bulky TV any day. You can set it up when you need it and pack it away when you don't. Most modern mini projectors weigh less than three pounds and fit in a backpack. They project anywhere from 40 to 120 inches, giving you that cinema feel without taking up floor space.

**Key Features to Look For**

Brightness matters more than you might think. Look for at least 200 ANSI lumens if you plan to watch during the day with some lights on. For darker rooms, even lower brightness works fine.

Resolution is another big deal. A 1080p portable projector gives you sharp, clear images. Some budget models offer 720p, which still looks decent on smaller projection sizes.

Battery life becomes crucial in apartments where outlets might not be everywhere you want them. Quality portable projectors run for 2-3 hours on a single charge, perfect for most movies.

Built-in speakers save you from dealing with extra equipment. While they won't blow your mind, they're usually good enough for casual viewing. You can always connect Bluetooth speakers later if you want better sound.

**Setting Up in Tight Quarters**

The beauty of these compact projectors is flexibility. You can project onto a blank wall, a white sheet, or even your ceiling if you want to watch from bed. Most units sit comfortably on a coffee table, nightstand, or small tripod.

Short throw distance helps in cramped apartments. Some models only need 3-5 feet from the wall to create a 60-inch image. That means you can use them even in a studio apartment bedroom.

**What Actually Matters**

Don't get caught up in fancy specs you won't use. Focus on what improves your daily experience: easy setup, decent battery, good image quality, and simple controls. Wireless connectivity like WiFi and Bluetooth makes streaming from your phone or laptop super easy.

If you're ready to transform your small apartment into an entertainment hub, check out some [top-rated portable projectors here](https://athomewave.com/portable-projector). You'll find options that fit different budgets and needs.

**Quick Buying Tips**

Read actual user reviews before buying. People living in apartments will mention if the projector works well in small rooms. Pay attention to comments about brightness, noise level, and ease of use.

Consider how you'll mainly use it. Gaming requires lower input lag. Movie watching needs better color accuracy. Presentations benefit from higher brightness.

Your budget matters too. Decent mini projectors start around $100-150, while premium models with better brightness and resolution can run $300-500.

**Making Your Decision**

The best portable projector for your small apartment comes down to your specific needs. Think about where you'll use it most, what you'll watch, and how often you'll move it around. A lightweight model with solid battery life and reliable 1080p output handles most situations perfectly.

1p9ax82,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1p9ax82/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

However, after looking at long term costs, I am considering returning it and turning toward a traditional espresso machine instead. Here is what I am looking for, and would appreciate advice on if I should keep my convenient yet pricier long term Nespresso machine, or opt to get one of the DeLonghi machines instead.

My current drinking habits:

I make 2 iced lattes every other day usually using 2 shots of espresso each. I tend to make iced mochas and prefer them topped with cold foam (prefer home made, but store bought is okay)

I currently own:

Nespresso Verturo Next with the Aeroccino 3

I am currently considering:

DeLonghi Classic Espresso Maker ($150 for BF)
or
DeLonghi Stilosa ($100 for BF)


I am good at making iced lattes with the “espresso style” shots the Nespresso brews, but know nothing about pulling shots of espresso. Although the convenience of a Nespresso is nice, I do have the time available to put the time into brewing true espresso when making coffee. The current price difference between traditional beans and pods yearly is about $350.

My best friend also purchased the same machine. We share a coffee subscription too, so both our coffee comes from the exact same batch.

My best friend has had no issues with his machine.

Up until last week, my machine produced perfect espresso shots. In the last week, the shots have become watery with bitter aftertaste. Over the last few days I’ve played around with the grind, shot volume and tamp setting but to no avail, I cannot get a full bodied espresso shot to come out. My coffee beans were 12 days past roast date when the shots started to come out watery. 

Just wondering if anyone has encountered this issue? Is my machine possibly faulty? 

I clean the group head with a tablet once week, and yesterday performed a descale to see if it would have any effect; nothing changed.

1p9apq3,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/28/national-guard-dc-police/,D.C. police to begin patrolling with National Guard after fatal attack,"National Guard troops patrolling in D.C. will be paired with local law enforcement personnel, at least temporarily, in the wake of the Wednesday attack that killed one troop and critically injured another, according to an email obtained by The Washington Post and two D.C. police officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss planning that is still in progress.

“Officers will conduct high-visibility patrols with the National Guard and provide assistance as needed,” said the email, which was sent to D.C. police leadership Wednesday evening. The email said the situation was “fluid,” and adjustments to the staffing plan could be made in the coming days.

If enacted on a long-term basis, the change would significantly shift the way National Guard troops have worked with local and federal law enforcement in the District since their arrival in August. Trump administration officials have credited the troops for helping reduce crime in the city — in part, they argued, because the troops’ presence at Metro stations and on National Park Service lands frees up law enforcement to police other areas of the city. Diverting local police to accompany Guard members would do essentially the opposite by siphoning them from other tasks in D.C. neighborhoods.

The email said the new pairing would start Thursday and Friday. A D.C. police official said some officers had been temporarily detailed to accompany the troops, and a more long-term policy change was under discussion.

The official, who stressed that the discussions were still preliminary, said D.C. police, Metro Transit Police, U.S. Park Police and several other law enforcement agencies were having conversations with the National Guard task force in D.C. about pairing the troops with police officers while they are on city streets. Since their deployment to D.C., groups of National Guard troops have largely operated unaccompanied by police, the official said.

The policy change would bolster protection for the approximately 2,000 National Guard members deployed to the District as part of President Donald Trump’s “Safe and Beautiful Task Force,” who are not required to have the same law enforcement training as city police officers.

A D.C. police spokesperson did not confirm the shift in policy but said in a statement that “law enforcement agencies across Washington, DC, including the Metropolitan Police Department, are working in close coordination with the National Guard to ensure the safety of our community.”

The Guard’s continued presence in the city remains the subject of litigation. D.C. Attorney Brian Schwalb (D) sued the Trump administration over the deployment in September, seeking the troops’ withdrawal from the city and describing their presence as an illegal “military occupation” that increased the risk of deadly encounters between residents and troops. Trump administration lawyers said in court that the risk of a deadly encounter was “totally speculative.”

“There have actually been fewer deadly encounters because the National Guard has been here, allowing a surge of resources,” Eric Hamilton, an attorney for the Trump administration, said in an October hearing.

Earlier this month, a judge said the deployment was illegal and ordered that it be halted as the lawsuit continues in court. But the judge paused her order from going into effect until Dec. 11 to give the administration time to appeal. The administration has since asked an appeals court to allow the D.C. mission to continue, requesting a ruling on an emergency basis by Dec. 4 and excoriating the judge’s order as a “wholly unjustified incursion into the territory of both the President and Congress.”

Still, in internal memos, officials have acknowledged the risks associated with the deployment since its inception.

“The Make D.C. Safe and Beautiful Mission presents an opportunity for criminals, violent extremists, issue motivated groups and lone actors to advance their interests,” reads an internal document from D.C. National Guard leadership made public through Schwalb’s lawsuit. The document, which outlined the deployment’s objectives, was dated Aug. 12, the day after the president declared a crime emergency in the city.

A second memo, dated Aug. 28, warned service members that “those inspired by foreign terrorist organizations” might view the mission as a target. That same day, a member of the D.C. National Guard asked D.C. police for increased patrols in areas where troops are staying.

“Service members are being harassed at these hotels,” he wrote in the email reviewed by The Washington Post. Court records said local law enforcement agreed to increase patrols and troops were instructed to take measures to protect themselves, including always using the “buddy system” and changing into civilian clothes when off duty.

In the aftermath of this week’s fatal attack, Trump administration officials have doubled down on the need for the troops in the city. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said within hours of the shooting that Trump had asked him to add 500 troops to the D.C. mission, adding that the shooting had “stiffen[ed] our resolve to ensure that we make Washington, D.C. safe and beautiful.”

Asked Thursday whether he would take any additional security measures for National Guard troops in the city, Trump replied, “No, just I want to have more.”

The troops were visibly accompanied by D.C. police on Thanksgiving Day. After a news conference Thursday at U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro’s office, a group of four National Guard members were patrolling with a single D.C. police officer near Seventh Street and Indiana Avenue in Northwest Washington. They got coffee together at a nearby Starbucks, then walked northbound on Seventh Street.

As they strolled, a staff member from Pirro’s office walking in the opposite direction said, “I’m sorry, guys.” Other pedestrians called out apologies as the group patrolled together.

I've been using tobacco, vapes, and lozenges on and off for 5 years, and never thought I could get to this point of progress. This week I drank multiple times and said no to nicotine each and every time! Here is a long list of things that are better in just a few weeks:

* My apple watch called out that my resting heartrate has dropped 15 in the last month - with more room to come down now that the ball is in my court.
* Lungs and breath depth are wayyy deeper - I can finally hit that satisfying depth.
* 0 random chest pains or aches, a common occurrence before when exercising and sometimes literally doing nothing.
* I fall and stay asleep so much easier - vaping used to keep me up late for no reason.
* Likely due to the sleep, but I definitely feel my muscles recovering much better from workouts.
* Again likely due to heart and lung strength coming back, but my cardio ability has skyrocketed.
* I'm a calm and low-stress person - but vaping's effect on my heart rate and blood pressure made me artificially anxious in difficult work and personal situations. Whether I was giving a big presentation or arguing with family, I am in a much better emotional state now to handle it - it all sucked more when vaping.
* Vaping used to dehydrate and age my face, and my skin looks and feels so much clearer now! I haven't broken out once since stopping.
* Vaping also definitely messed with my bowel movement - I relied on it to go in the morning and feel as though it would constipate me later in the day. I feel more in control of this now that the variable is deleted.
* My parents, fiance, in-laws, and even some friends would kill me if they found out I was vaping - but I was so addicted and careless I had almost been caught a dozen times over the years. Never have to worry about this again. Not to mention that it is quite an embarrassing habit for those you don't mind knowing.
* Parts of life that I love (morning coffee, socializing, driving, occasional drinking, eating, etc.) are no longer associated/triggering with a vape hit right after.
* I know this is debatable, but I've grown to accept that vaping is a generally unprofessional and embarrassing habit: no more turning my camera off to vape, go to the bathroom, waving the smoke out, etc. thank god!
* Since vaping messes with your blood pressure, my circulation was awful. My limbs would fall asleep regularly, and this literally never happens anymore.

The list goes on ... I'm beyond happy with my progress and would love to help anyone else. It gets SOOO much easier after a few days, and after a few weeks you barely think about it.",1,1764375409.0,QuitVaping,1,1.0,False

I can’t believe I’m doing this, but my husband and I can’t get on the same page for this one. He feels that gifts, no matter how small, should be appreciated. I agree. If it was any other day it would’ve been fine, but as I stared at the coffee scented bar of soap I couldn’t fake a genuine smile.

It’s good to know that I love coffee in all its glory and anything that has to do with coffee would normally make me happy, but this? 

A little background information is that my husband has recently purchased a home gym device that cost him an arm and a leg. I didn’t agree with the purchase, because he wanted to start a personal training business with that singular full body machine. He was excited about renting a small office space (that had no windows), and putting it in there to make money. He’s not a personal trainer either, and we’re surrounded by gyms in our area (3 gyms). He has spent all his savings on this one device that is now and I understand that but I don’t agree with it and the timing of it.

Today I’ve was being colder than usual, because I was exhausted and hurt. I didn’t want to talk but he kept pushing so I told him that I didn’t enjoy the gift, that it felt insulting and insufficient. He got pissed off because I’m not appreciating the situation that he is in. 

I don’t see it as a situation that he’s in, but a choice that he made. He left the house without saying a word and returned with flowers and matcha. I was honest and told him that it felt like putting a bandaid on it, but not genuine. 

He’s mad again and I’m exhausted and unsure if I’ve made the right choice and if I’m the asshole for not just appreciating the flowers. Idk 

TLDR: my husband got me soap for my birthday, after spending a lot of money on something I didn’t really agree with. ",37,1764375246.0,AmItheAsshole,44,0.96,False

She drinks black drip coffee every morning, usually about seven cups, and she really loves coffee in general. She also enjoys espresso when we are out, which is why I think she might have fun learning how to make it at home. She has never made espresso before and we do not have any space limits on the counter.

She would prefer an electric grinder and an electric machine. I have been watching a bunch of James Hoffmann videos and it seems like the grinder matters as much as the machine, so I am planning on getting both.

So far I have mostly looked at Breville. The Dynamic Duo from Seattle Coffee Gear looks interesting and the Barista Express Impress also caught my eye. At this point I am realizing I have no idea what I am doing and this whole topic goes way deeper than I expected, especially since I do not even like coffee.

What I would really appreciate is some advice on a solid machine and grinder combo in this price range for someone who is brand new to espresso. I am also open to hearing whether I should stick with Breville or look at something else entirely.

Thanks in advance for any guidance.

1p9a85n,https://v.redd.it/vtwu126e734g1,"Missing you today, of all days…","I’m in the Chili’s parking lot right now, trembling tbh, and I feel completely insane for even typing this out, but if there is one place on earth that might understand, it’s this sub... 

Today is Black Friday. Day after Thanksgiving here in the STates. Everyone’s out hauling TVs and air fryers, but for my family, Black Friday has always meant one thing at the end of all that chaos: OG chicken crispers at Chili’s. Not “crispy” crispers. Not “new recipe” crispers. The old ones—the pale golden ones with the weird soft batter that soaked up the honey mustard like a sponge. The ones that looked almost wrong if you tried to describe them to someone but somehow tasted perfect when you actually ate them. We had a whole routine growing up: wake up in the dark, mom with her coffee, stepdad blasting news radio to ""focus"" on deals. We’d hit the stores until everyone was exhausted and borderline homicidal, and then we’d “treat ourselves” at the same Chili’s location, same booth if we could get it. The second we sat down, before menus or drinks, I would say it: “I’m getting the OG chicken crispers.” It was like a spell. The plate would come out with steam curling up, fries spilling over, and that little cup of honey mustard. I would cut into the first crisper and the batter would squish just right. That first bite was like the official start of the holiday season for me; the world outside could be a war zone, but in that booth, it was just us and the crispers.

Then one year, about 12 years ago, everything sort of snapped. We did the whole mall thing, but my stepdad had just told us he was moving out “after the holidays” — such a psycho phrase, scheduling his exit like a dentist appointment smh — but we still went to Chili’s because pretending everything is normal is our family sport. I ordered my OG chicken crispers like always, but as I ate them, something in me just broke. Out of nowhere, I started full-body, ugly crying, chest tight, unable to breathe. I ended up having my first full-blown panic attack right there in the booth, mid-bite. They had to walk me outside where I gasped for air next to the handicapped spot while my mom held my shoulders. That was the day my whole life got split into Before Chili’s Panic Attack and After Chili’s Panic Attack. Therapy, meds, all of it followed.

Here’s the twisted part, tho...The only thing that made me feel like I still had one foot in the “before” times was going back every Black Friday and ordering the OG chicken crispers again. It was like exposure therapy and comfort food mashed together. I was terrified of that booth and that smell, but sitting there with that exact plate made it feel like I could control the memory. If I could finish my crispers without flipping out, I knew I was doing better than last year. Then Chili’s took them away. No announcement, no ceremony. Just a cheerful server telling me, “Oh we don’t have those anymore, but we have our NEW crispers, they’re way better!” Come on. I laughed in her face tbh. I didn’t mean to, it just came out. Better for your food cost spreadsheet maybe, but not for the unhinged corner of my brain that needed that exact batter and texture to feel okay for the next twelve months. We ordered the new ones and it was like eating a knockoff version of my own memories. Somewhere in a Brinker office, there is probably a .PDF that says “Legacy Chicken Crispers discontinued,” and they have no GD idea that line is tied to the moment where my overstimulated brain finally found a way to make peace with one of the worst days of my life. They strpped away the one weird, greasy little anchor I had to the version of me that wasn’t constantly scanning my own body for signs of doom.

So, now it’s Black Friday again. I did the shop, the survive, the too-early-for-my-liking carols, but now instead of the reset button, I’m staring at a menu that doesn’t know me anymore. I’m missing the ritual and the stupid comfort of that first soggy bite that let me think, “I made it another year.” If some Brinker exec ever stumbles across this while doomscrolling brand mentions, just know there is at least one very anxious person in your parking lot who would sell half their Black Friday haul to see “Original Chicken Crispers” on that menu again. I’m gonna go inside and order whatever fake crisper situation you’ve got and pretend it’s fine, but it’s not. Not really.",27,1764374645.0,Chilis,15,0.92,False

And lonely doesn’t mean forgotten.

The ones that matter.
The ones people feel.
The ones that remind you that humanity still exists, even in dark parking lots and long empty highways.

Maybe one of my stories is about someone you love.
Or someone you’ve lost.
Or someone you prayed for.

Hell, maybe we’ve passed each other already.

I didn’t remember anything before the white room.

Just the sterile smell of bleach and the gentle hum of a fan. 

I awoke on ice cold floor tiles, facedown in a puddle of my own drool.

I remembered my name instantly. I was Mary.

I was 38 years old.

But that was it. I had no idea who I was or where I had come from.

The room was stark white and clinical, with four TV screens in front of me. 

The screens were old, the kind from my childhood, with a built-in VCR, chunky and box-like. 

When I woke up, they were on standby, static prickling across the glass. 

I demanded where I was, my mouth filled with rotten tasting ick. 

Silence. 

The buzzing lights above flickered off, leaving me in the dark, disoriented and, I guess, forced to look at the four screens. 

Below them sat a small glass table with a steaming cup of coffee and a single cookie. 

For a while, I was too scared to move. I sat on my knees, trying to remember anything about my life. 

But like broken puzzle pieces, I had come apart, unraveling, left only with my name and age.

Was I suffering from memory loss? 

I checked myself over, testing for a head injury. I knew exactly how to perform health checks, almost obsessively checking for concussions.

That told me something. I was in the medical field, perhaps. But this felt personal somehow. Too personal. 

This felt, oh god, like I had done this before. 

And just like those times, revulsion crept up my throat, panic twisting in my gut. 

But I didn’t know why. I didn’t know why I felt sick to my stomach, why my cheeks burned, why my hands trembled.

I was used to checking for bumps and scrapes. I knew exactly where to prod my scalp, running my fingers down my skull.

But I was fine.

I tried to escape. 

There were two cameras on the ceiling, which meant I was being observed, and my instinct screamed at me to get the fuck out. At that point, I didn't care how. I tried the door. Locked. 

I screamed to be let out. 

Again, silence. 

Heavy, suffocating silence that was too *loud*. 

That captured my every breath, making me too aware of my frenzied gasps. 

I noticed a pile of tapes sitting on the VCR player. 

I crawled forward and grabbed the first one at the top of the pile. 

FEB 2024 was scrawled in block capitals across the label. 

I felt like I was in a trance, like something was compelling me. 

The tape felt right in my clammy hands, as if I had held it before. 

I slid it into the machine and pressed play. The screens flickered on.

A room full of kids.

Teenagers.

They looked like college students or high school seniors, seventeen or eighteen years old. 

The room was identical to mine, but smaller. The same four white walls. 

But unlike my room, theirs was empty. No TV screens, no coffee or food. 

Just blank white walls staring back at them, and a single bucket for a toilet. 

I had no idea how long they had been inside. 

But when one of them, a blonde girl with a high ponytail, jumped up and began throwing herself at the walls, panic clawed up my throat. 

This was the start. 

The girl started screaming. 

Almost immediately, another girl, a brunette with tight curls, stood up, strode over to her, and slapped her across the face. I tensed, waiting for a fight to break out. 

But instead of hitting back, the blonde wrapped her arms around the brunette, sobbing into her shoulder. 

A moment later, they both returned to the others, sitting cross-legged on the floor.

I counted ten of them. Five girls, five boys.

They wore identical white shorts and t-shirts, blending into the walls and floor. They looked disoriented. Just like me.

They sat in a circle, wide-eyed, staring at each other like they were strangers.

No.

I moved closer, glued to the screen, watch the them back away from each other. 

One boy shuffled back, jumped up, and tried to run, smacking straight into the wall. 

They *were* strangers.

I wasn’t even sure they knew their own names.

My heart felt like it was lodged in my throat. Were they nearby? 

Were they in the next room? 

If they were in the room next to mine, then we could help each other. 

Already, I was slamming my fists against the door, then the walls, screaming for help. 

“Hello?” I shrieked, before my cry died in my throat, and I almost fucking laughed. I wasn't watching a *live* tape. 

The realization slowly settled in, like cruel  pinpricks sliding into me. 

I turned back to the screens, stumbling over, and grabbing the second tape.

**MAR 2024**.

Something thick and slimy filled my mouth. I placed the tape back on the pile, forcing myself to stay calm. 

I was an adult– and these kids, wherever they were currently, needed my help. 

That's what I kept fucking telling myself, but every so often, my gaze would find the screens once again, and I felt myself unraveling. 

The footage was recorded last year– and the pile of tapes were clearly documenting their captivity. 

Sure, they could have been rescued, I told myself. 

But if these kids were safe, I wouldn't have been kidnapped.  I was already putting the pieces together. 

Whoever took me wanted me to *watch* these teenagers inside this white room with no door– no escape– no food. 

Instinctively, I drank the coffee and ate the cookie. 

Whoever these people were, they weren't interested in hurting me. They wanted to hurt these teenagers. 

The coffee was lukewarm and the cookie tasted familiar, somehow. 

Oven baked and fresh. There was icing, but it had been scraped off. 

Something told me I wouldn't be in the room long– not long enough to get hungry or thirsty. I found myself scanning the ceiling for more cameras. 

There was one attached to every corner, most likely recording every angle of my face. 

My stomach twisted as I studied the monitors. 

Like mine, they displayed different angles of the room trapping the teens. Screen one zoomed in on the girls.""

Four of them had gathered together already, with one stray boy joining them. 

Screens two and three focused on the boys, appearing to be already arguing. 

Screen four was a bird’s-eye view of all of them.

“All right, everyone listen up,” one of the boys stood. 

He looked like the leader type. Tall and athletic looking, thick brown hair and freckles. The kids didn't have names, so I renamed him *Boy #1* in my head. 

Boy 1’s voice was shaking, but he kept his expression stoic. I noticed he kept scratching at his arms—a nervous tic? 

“So, I’m pretty sure someone is playing some fucking sick game.” 

His head tipped back, eyes glued to the camera. 

Screen three zoomed right into his face, his twitching bottom lip. 

He was trying not to cry. 

“But we need to keep a clear head, okay? Does anyone remember anything about themselves?” 

He pointed to himself. 

“I don't know my name. I just know I'm eighteen, and I just graduated high school.”

Boy 1 took a leadership role. He was reluctant, but the other kids seemed to gravitate towards him. 

They went around the room, and it became clear to me that these kids had their memories fucked with too. 
 
The blonde (I named her Girl #1) who freaked out earlier in the tape, was immediately intriguing. 

She didn't know her name, but she *did* tearfully exclaim, “I have a Mom, and I *know* she's looking for me.” which triggered paranoia among the group. 

The brunette (Girl #2) who slapped her, brought up the possibility of Girl #1 being “in” on their imprisonment. 

“That's ridiculous,” Boy #1 snapped. He stood up, assuming his role of leader. 

This room had no concept of time, or night and day. They could have been arguing for hours, and they wouldn't even know it. “Why would she *willingly* join in on whatever this is?”

“Well, this is clearly some kind of test,” Girl #2 said matter-of-factly. 

“What if she's, I don't know, the daughter of one of the researchers— or even a researcher herself!”

“I told you, I'm not in on this! I don't know anything about this!” Girl #1 shrieked, pulling her legs to her chest. 

She seemed genuinely afraid, burying her head in her knees. 

“Please. I just want to go home.” she screamed, and the others jumped. “I want to go home! I want my Mom!”

Girl #2 started to speak, only for Boy#1 to shoot her the mother of all death glares. 

“Don't.” He shuffled over to her. 

“The last thing we need is to lose trust in each other.""

Girl#2 averted her gaze, sliding away from him. “Get the fuck away from me.”

Boy #1 looked hurt. I could tell he was the weakest among the group. 

He made the mistake of acting like a leader– but he was doing just that. 

Acting. In reality, he was just a scared teenager. His bottom lip wobbled, but he shook his head, forcing a wide gritted smile. “Aye, aye, captain.”

“Aww, Freckles thinks we’re getting out of here with the power of ‘friendship’.”

Another kid, a guy with thick blonde hair and glasses, was curled into himself. I was sure he was crying, but no matter how many times the cameras tried to catch his face, he avoided it. 

I called him Boy #2.

“That's fucking ah-dor-able! I'll make sure to rely on *friendship* when we’re starving.”

To my surprise, Boy#1 crawled over to the guy, laying down beside him. 

“Go away,” Boy#2 grumbled into his arms. “I'm trying to manifest my way home.”

Boy#1 snorted. It was the first time I'd seen him smile. 

“And you call *me* delusional.”

The MARCH 24 tape outlined what looked like the first month of their imprisonment. 

I watched it; every second, every camera angle. 

The kids got used to their captivity, distracting themselves with games of Charades and Sleeping Lions. 

They each gave up a clothing item, so they could create a makeshift curtain for the toilet. 

They were given new clothes, but it was weekly, instead of daily. 

Glued to the tape, I barely noticed someone had replaced my coffee with a new one. 

This time, I was given a cupcake– again, with the icing scraped off. 

Ignoring my own circumstances, I watched the kids slowly start to unravel. 

Food was given to them every morning at exactly 7am. 

It was *good* food. I watched them receive trays of McDonald's breakfast, and for the first few days, and then weeks, they seemed okay. 

The kids started to form a plan to escape, orchestrated by #Boy 1.

Their plan was to wait until their food was delivered, and then “attack in numbers.”

However, when their breakfast *was* delivered, it was a single slice of bread. 

I already knew what game their kidnappers were playing. 

After three days of no breakfast, Boy#1 caught on. 

“They're punishing us,” he spoke up, while they were sharing half of a slice of bread. 

The portion sizes were getting smaller and smaller. 

Boy#1 was rationing his own, tearing pieces off and eating them in intervals. 

He was also hiding yesterday's water down his pants. This kid was smart. 

“We formulated a plan to escape, and the people watching us don't want that,” he said. Boy #1’s lips formed a small smile. 

He was planning something. “So, for *now*, we play their fucking game.”

He was right. 

The kids stayed mostly silent all day, and were rewarded with three cooked meals.

Following Boy#1’s words, the teens stayed quiet. 

Boy #2 suggested they named themselves. 

Boy#1 wanted to be named “Clem.” because it felt “right.”

Boy #2, insisted on Ryder. 

Boy#3, who I was pretty sure was  narcoleptic, curled up in one corner was named, “Zzz.”

Boy#4, a hard faced redhead who started most arguments over food, refused to be renamed, so the others called him, “Shitface.”

Finally, Boy#5, a kid with a buzzcut, just shrugged, and called himself, “Buzz.”

""Girl #1—the blonde, who had calmed down—didn't want to be part of the naming ceremony. 

But halfway through, she squeaked, 'Sabrina! I like the name Sabrina.” 

Girl #2, the fiery brunette, immediately called her out. 

“Okay, but *why* Sabrina?” she demanded, her eyes narrowed, hands planted on hips. “So, that's your real name?”

She was ignored– and after realizing her theories weren't helping, Girl#2 sighed, and reluctantly named herself, “Scooby.”

Girl #3, a quiet kid with pigtails, shrugged. “I like Ruby?”

Girl #4, the frizzy redhead with glasses, didn't speak. So, the others gave her a name. 

Mittens. 

Girl #5, who had come up with the naming ceremony, smiled widely. 

She pinned her dark curls into a knotted bun. I had never seen an 18-year-old wear butterfly hair slides.

“Brianna!”

The tape ended on her wide smiling face, the screen flickering off. 

I didn't have any concept of time in that room. 

But I had a feeling the tape had lasted around 2 hours. 

Two hours per tape, and three coffee refills I never saw. 

While I had been watching, another two cupcakes were balanced on a plate. 

I checked them. 

The icing had once again been scraped off. 

For a moment, I was paralyzed, coffee-bile sliding back up my throat. 

“Who *are* you?” I asked the people watching me. 

When I was met with no response, I kept my voice calm. 

“What are you doing to these children?”

I had so many questions. 

*Why was I being made to watch these tapes?*

*Why VCR in 2025?* 

*Were these kids alive or dead– and did I even want to know?*

When my cry bounced back at me, reverberating around the room, I felt myself snap. 

I screamed, but it felt like screaming into a vacuum, my own cry sounding wrong, foreign, not even mine. 

I was trembling, my chest aching, my throat on fire. 

I didn't want to watch it. I couldn't. 

But already, I was crawling over to the pile of tapes, choosing **APRIL 24.**

Whatever happened to these kids, I couldn't stop it. 

But every time that fucking tape slipped from my fingers, I dropped to my knees and grabbed it, running my fingers over the surface. It felt personal, and wrong, and yet *right* in my hands. 

The scratchy label, and the smooth plastic of the tape. 

I rolled it around between my hands, my gaze glued to each screen. 

I wish I never watched them. 

I wish I never knew their names. 

But I had to *know* what happened to them. 

I had to know what twelve months of captivity did to these kids. 

Feeling sick to my stomach, I slid in APRIL 24.

The screen flashed blue, before flickering to life on a still shot of Boy#1 (Clem) with his ear pressed to the door. 

The others were gathered around, sitting in a semicircle. I had missed several days.

The kids looked worn out and tired, their clothes filthy and torn up. 

There was a giant crayonned rainbow on the far wall. 

Mittens (Girl#4) was playing with a green crayon, sticking it in her mouth like a cigarette. 

I guessed they were given them. 

""It's here!"" Clem stumbled back, and my gaze found him once again—his eyes wide.

His cry caused a commotion among the others, and realization slammed into me. 

They were starving again. Clem’s eyes were hollow, his cheeks sunken and significantly pale. There was a certain twitch in his lips I was trying to ignore. 

He had torn off the bottoms of his pants, wrapping them around his head. 

I had no idea how long they had been without food, but the way they moved, almost feral, backing away from the door like startled deer, gave me an idea. It looked like days.

""Everyone, get *back*!"" he snarled, and to my surprise, the others slowly retracted.

Clem really was a leader, glaring down the others until they stepped back. 

Scooby (Girl #2) squeaked in delight when the food was delivered through a slot in the door. Six bags of steaming Five Guys.

But the delivery wasn't finished. 

When they were all tearing into their meals, something else was slid through. 

I barely even noticed it myself. I was too busy watching Clem eating like an animal, stuffing fries down his throat. 

He was going to *choke*. I felt uncomfortable, my hands shaking, like I could reach through the screen and snatch his burger off of him. 

The boy was ravenous. I didn't understand *why* I felt physical pain in my chest. 

I had only known these kids for a few hours, and already, I was attached to them. 

I snapped out of it when the second delivery hit the ground, startling the kids. 

It hit the sterile white floor tiles with a BANG. 

A pick-axe. 

I felt the phantom legs of a spider entwine around my spine. 

Clem dropped his burger, and stood slowly. 

“Don't go near it!” Girl#1 (Sabrina) shrieked. 

Clem didn’t listen to her, and something twisted in my gut. He picked it up, the thing weighty in his hands, then hurled it at the wall.

“Fuck you,” Clem spat, his gaze flicking to camera three.

I felt a visceral reaction running through me, shuffling back on my knees.

Then, unexpectedly, he broke into a manic grin.

“We’re not *that* crazy yet.”

With a mocking bow, he returned to his meal, and the others fell in stride with him. 

Nobody mentioned the pick-axe, and each kid seemed relatively adjusted. 

They played games, drawing on the walls, resorting back to *children*. 

I noticed Shitface (Boy#4) inching towards the axe, but he just laughed when Clem backed him into a corner. 

Shitface shoved him back, maintaining a wide grin. “Relax, Freckles. I'm joking around.”

The girls, however, who had formed a tight-knit group, kept their distance. 

When the next day came around, I think they were expecting no breakfast. 

And they were right. 

“It's okay,” Clem reassured them. “We ate yesterday. We should be okay for a while.”

Sabrina nodded, perched in Scooby’s lap. “He's right! They'll feed us eventually.”

They were *wrong*. 

Three days passed with no food and limited water (I think they were drinking from the toilet) and fights were starting to break out.

Clem was sharing what he'd managed to scavenge, but I could see it in their faces. 

They were starting to lose their balance, growing delirious. 

Sometimes, their wandering gazes found the pick-axe still lying on the floor. 

They looked away, quickly, but it was clear these kids were starting to get desperate. 

The lights flickered off, plunging them into darkness. 

I could still see them through what looked like night vision, but the kids were blind. 

They gathered together in one corner, led by Clem. 

“It's okay.” he kept telling them, his voice shuddering. “We can get through this.”

Another day without food or light, the majority of them too hungry to move, and Shitface (Boy#4  finally snapped. 

“They're not going to feed us,” he announced, slowly getting to his feet, swaying off balance. He stumbled, and alarm bells started ringing in my head. 

“Unless we *use* it.”

Clem stood, but Boy#2 (Ryder), the sandy haired kid, yanked him back down. 

“He's doing it on purpose, bro,” Ryder muttered, his eyes half-lidded. 

He was the peacemaker. “Dude just wants fucking attention.”

To my surprise, Boy#3 (Zzz) and Boy#5 (Buzz) also got to their feet. 

Shit Face crawled over to the axe, blindly grabbing for it. 

“We’re all hungry,” he announced, smacking the blade into his hand. 

His eyes were crazed, almost feral, lips pulled back in a bloodthirsty grin.

Shit Face held up the axe. 

“Soooo, I propose, instead of sitting around singing kumbaya waiting to fucking starve to death, we choose someone for the chop.”

The others screamed, immediately on their feet. The way they responded reminded me of animals in a pack. 

They couldn't *see*, but I think they could sense each other, and that was enough. With a sharp jerk of his head, Clem motioned the others behind him. 

Clem, Ryder, and Sabrina started forwards, uncertain, in the pitch dark. 

But this was already a mistake, and they *knew* that. 

Scooby and Mittens dragged them back, with help from Brianna.

Shitface swung the axe playfully. “I'm just saying! We got actual food when we did what they wanted.” 

He started toward the others in slow, teasing strides. “I nominate Freckles. He is our leader, after all, and what leader wouldn't sacrifice himself?”

The boy’s lips curved into a smirk. “For the *greater good*, dude.”

The lights suddenly flickered on, surprising the group. 

Clem’s side backed away, blinking rapidly, some of them hissing. 

While Shitface stayed nonchalant, swinging the axe. 

They saw it as a mercy, some of the girls breaking down in relief, far off in the corner. 

I saw Shitface’s smile grow, his eyes widening.

*He* saw it like invisible gods were confirming his belief. 

“They gave us *light* back!” he yelled, and through that stone-cold demeanor and wild eyes, I glimpsed a scared teenage boy. 

He was terrified, so he was acting out. 

""They want something back, after what they've given us,"" he announced, slipping effortlessly into the leadership role. ""They've fed us. Now they want payment.""

He was playing with their heads to get them to agree. 

Shitface was smart. Smarter than he let on. 

He was hungry, I understood that. He was fucking scared. 

But resorting to *murder*? 

The boy was in front of Clem in three strides, Zzz and Buzz following. 

Shitface’s smile was spiteful. He’d been itching to take the lead. 

I could tell by the way he moved, that cocky saunter in his step. 

“You want us all to be okay, right?” he murmured, inclining his head mockingly. 

“You want everything to be fucking sunshine and rainbows. So why not take one for the team, o’ fearless leader?”

He dropped to his knees, dramatizing a cry. 

“Please! Oh, *leader*, must you let us suffer? We are your *followers*, after all!”

Clem didn't move. 

Sabrina stood behind him, pressing her face into his shoulder. 

“Ignore him,” she murmured. “Just get back.”

Clem gently shook her away with a defeated sigh. 

“Okay, fine, you're right,” he told Shitface. “Give me the axe.”

Shitface’s expression crumpled with confusion.

He lurched back, but Clem snatched the axe, twisted around, and hacked off Sabrina’s head with a single, brutal chop to the back of her neck. 

I think I tried to stop the tape, but I was frozen, watching pooling scarlet seeping across white tiles. 

The others erupted into screams, and Sabrina’s body landed at Clem’s feet. 

He didn't move, his fingers tightening around the wooden handle, beads of red dripping down his face and splattering his white tee. 

Shitface staggered back, his eyes wide, mouth open. 

Clem, unsteady on his feet, pivoted to face the others cowering in the corner. 

He was eerily calm, his gaze unblinking. I think I had just watched this boy lose his humanity. 

His eyes were vacant, empty pools, a flicker of a triumphant smile twitching on his lips. 

The hollowness of his expression stood out, terrifying and void, and I wondered if I was seeing everything. 

The tapes had been strategically recorded. I had no doubt there was missing footage.

""If they don't feed us, then we will feed them.""

I felt like I was going to puke. 

Boy#1. 

Clem. 

I found myself moving closer to the screen, until I could feel static prickling my face.

He was still a kid. 

I didn't understand *why* I was crying. 

I couldn't stop, my hands were trembling, my heart pounding through my chest. 

He was eighteen. Just graduated. 

I fell back when he swung the axe one more time, his gaze locked onto the camera, before placing it back on the floor. 

Ignoring Sabrina’s body, Clem turned his attention to Shitface. 

“Don't *fuck* with me,” he murmured. Before he  dragged himself to a corner, dropped to his knees, and curled into a ball.

Scooby did her best to cover Sabrina’s body. 

Mittens helped her. 

Brianna sat in a corner, head buried in her knees.

Breakfast came the next morning. Nine individual trays filled with croissants, cupcakes, toast, cereal and chocolate. 

The others stuffed their faces. But I wasn't watching them. 

I was watching Clem.

Who, instead of joining them for breakfast, was crawling towards Sabrina’s body at a snail's pace. 

When he reached her, I expected him to say a prayer, or hug her. 

Instead, Clem soaked his hands in her  blood, and shuffled over to the wall. 

He used her blood like paint, while the wall was his canvas, head inclined, lazily dragging his fingers, scrawling a simple: “:)”. 

The other kids’ expressions were clear on each screen. They were terrified of him. 

Mittens and Brianna were silently eating while Scooby and Shitface stayed away, hiding in individual corners of the room. 

Ryder was the only one trying to make conversation, picking at his chocolate croissant. 

But even his gaze was frantic, flicking back and forth between Clem and the blood-stained axe abandoned in the corner. 

When a loaded gun was dropped through the delivery slot in the door this time, all eyes turned to Clem, still hovering over Sabrina’s body. 

It looked like he was trying to push her brains back inside her skull. 

Mittens surprised me by shuffling over to the gun and sticking it down her shirt.

She nodded to the others and, to my confusion, they seemed to go along with it.

Ryder dropped a plate of food in front of Clem.

“Eat, dude.” He pulled a face. “What the fuck are you doing?”

“Didn't we get another weapon this morning?” Clem asked, sitting up with a sigh.

Something acidic filled my mouth. He was smearing her blood all over his face.

Ryder didn't reply, and the teenager turned to the others.

“I said, did we get another fucking *weapon*?”

“Nope.” Shitface spoke up from his corner. “No need for frontal lobotomies today, oh fearless leader.”

Clem slowly inclined his head, and the lights flickered off once again. 

These kidnappers were clever. They were using the lights as a form of communication. 

“No.”

I was already choking on my words when Mittens dropped the gun with a squeak. 

Before I knew what I was doing, I slammed my fists into the wall. 

“Stop!” I shrieked, my mouth full of bile. 

“What was *that*?”

Clem’s voice sent my heart into my throat. Onscreen, his gaze was on the camera. 

Directly at me. 

There was no way he could hear me. This was pre-recorded footage from a year ago. 

And yet… 

“What was *what*?” Ryder murmured with a nervous laugh. “Can you hear somethin’?”

I threw myself into the walls, screaming. 

They could *hear* me. But that was impossible. 

""That."" Clem staggered to the wall, pressing his ear against its sterile white. 

His eyes narrowed, his lip curling. ""It's a woman.""

With the group’s attention on the cameras, I grabbed the coffee cup, hurling it against the wall. 

“Hello?!” I yelled. “It's okay! I'm going to get you out of there!”

The tape stopped with nine pairs of eyes trained on camera four. 

I felt myself hit the ground, my head spinning. 

There was no way they could hear me. No way. 

I slid back over to the tapes, kneeling in freezing cold coffee. 

Feeling suffocated, I shoved the MAY 24 tape into the player. 

Blank. 

The screen was white. It was playing, but there was no *footage*. 

Panic started to slither down my spine, contorting in my gut.

I ejected the tape, and slid in JUNE 24.

Blank. 

The screen this time was bright blue reflecting in my face. 

By now, I was scrambling, grabbing JULY 24.

They were all blank of footage. Empty. I went through AUGUST 24 and SEPTEMBER 24.

I think at this point, it was starting to hit me. 

Was APRIL 24 *live*? 

I left the screens, this time pounding on the door. 

“Hello?” I cried, punching the wall until my fists were bleeding. “Can anyone hear me?”

When *my* lights went out, the screens flashed from bright blue to a single still image. 

Clem. 

His face was projected on all four screens, his wide, grinning mouth, his hollow eyes. 

Behind him, the walls had been smeared scarlet, entrails dripping from the ceiling. 

I could see bodies behind him, but I couldn't make them out. 

He inclined his head slowly, a mockery of a bow, as blood seeped down his chin, stringy red tangled in his hair. 

And atop his head sat a crown of *something*, stark and jagged, glittering in the dim white light.

I tried six months worth of tapes, all the way to March 25.

But every single one was just Clem *grinning* at the camera.

Sometimes, he would paw at it like an animal, fleshy red clinging to his teeth. 

DECEMBER 24 was more lively. 

He skipped around the room, slipping in blood, giggling, for almost six hours straight, before going back to the camera. 

Back to *me*. 

When I ejected the last tape, the door clicked open. 

I reached for the tapes, but a voice startled me. 

“Leave them, Mary.”

I did, slowly walking out of the room. 

I was on a long white corridor, and drinking in each door, those kids could have been behind one of them. 

Before I could check them out, a fire door was opened, and I was ushered outside where a car was waiting. 

I got inside with no question, and the car drove me… home. 

Home. 

I suddenly recognized my home town. The high school. 

The Kindergarten. 

The soccer field. 

When the car stopped at the end of my road, I almost toppled out, my memories slamming into me like waves of ice water. 

I ran home to my husband, who was standing on the doorstep, his lips pursed.

He was pale, his hands full of *paper*. 

Harry. 

He hugged me, wrapping his arms around me. 

“You didn't find him,” he whispered into my shoulder. 

I pulled away, my throat on fire. 

“Him?”

I jumped when a golden retriever jumped up at me. 

Clem. 

I ruffled his head, tears stinging my eyes. 

He was such a good boy. 

Harry led me back inside our house, into our kitchen filled with cookies and cupcakes with, “HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BOY?” perfectly written with blue icing. 

And littering our house, posters with a familiar face. 

I snatched one up, and immediately puked. 

Zach. 

The smiling boy on the cupcakes and cookies, on the *missing* posters.

I knew how to look for bumps and scrapes because I was *used* to them.

I was used to checking for concussion when my baby was knocked over on the football field. 

I wasn't in the medical field. I wasn't a doctor. 

I was a *Mom*. 

I didn't know I was screaming until Harry wrapped me into a hug. 

“Honey, what's wrong?” he kept saying, but I was numb. 

I climbed the stairs with shaky legs and stumbled into my son’s room. 

*Zach.*

Memories swamped me, dragging me to all fours.

I remembered his tenth birthday party, his mouth full of frosting. 

*”Look, Mommy!” 

His voice is in my head. I can still see his face. Zach, my sweet boy. 

How did I forget him? How did they MAKE me forget him? 

#Boy 1.

Clem, the emotionless killer who murdered a room full of teenagers.

Someone who loves doing stuff outdoors but also doesn't mind being a homebody too. I'd love to get to know you over the course of a few dates - starting with something simple like a coffee date.

A little bit about me... I'm a hard-working bachelor with a good job, my own place, a car, a fur baby (cat), no kids and some extra time to date. I'm passionate about healthy living, exercising, good conversation, music (80s and 90s pop, 90s rap, metal & classic rock), board games, stand-up comedy, video games, card games, movies (huge fan of horror, action and comedy movies) and outdoorsy activities. I'm family oriented and would love to have a big, fat, happy family one day. I love to socialize, drink (only really socially), go out to bars, do karaoke and play board games in groups. Also a big fan of arcade bars.

Realistically I'm looking to foster a loving relationship where trust and loyalty are the emphasis. I am very loyal and want to find someone who is as well. I want to get to know you so we can connect and develop a proper, *monogamous* relationship. This would entail talking to each other often and really putting in the effort to get to know each other better.

I go to the gym regularly and I'm in pretty decent shape. Wouldn't mind if you also lift & do cardio like me so we can even work out at the gym together.

I'm of European descent but was born and raised here in Toronto. I'm average height, have hazel eyes, I'm handsome, confident and quick-witted. I like to think of myself as being affable, thoughtful and considerate.

My type is a woman who is intelligent, funny and fun to hang out with. if we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together we should be able to have fun together, right? Haha.",1,1764374174.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

I'm curious how people here feel about if we got ""typical day at SDN"" content; no big story events, but a few new shifts of calls to dispatch, perhaps set in the aftermath of S1, or they could even add it as canonically in the midst of S1, during the days we don't see in the main story. A more unrealistic idea is for a roguelike mode, though that would require a number of repeat calls and call randomization options.

Would that be compelling enough for you to warrant pulling out the pocketbook? Or would you need more dialogue options and story decisions before you would pay any extra? 

It just hit me how much I'd love an ""endless"" mode of Dispatching. Really I jusy wanted some more typical shifts, and to have all the mechanics in play. Each day in game adds elements or people, which is fun but left with a feeling of being in a constant tutorial mode. I would want random sabotages (Z-team isn't perfect and still competitive), more hard hacking puzzles, failures that lower morale or insta KO, and more cases of hero-unique options that cause failure if you don't think about it (e.g. sending Flambae to contain a fire, or Waterboy to handle a flood). I'd especially love to keep leveling Robert up and unlock more power-ups like the coffee and first aid. Not more options, but earn having 2 or 3 of each, and actually needing to use them thanks to having more call volume than can feasibly be dispatched unless you do a perfect run. Basically the final shift without the endgame threat, and with failed and missed calls only hurting your score and thus Robert's XP gain. ",12,1764374154.0,DispatchAdHoc,5,1.0,False

1p99uod,https://i.redd.it/echzkj7q434g1.jpeg,Help me find this?. Ty in advance you amazing people. App name says Staread,"For three days, I was in the hospital. For three days, my phone didn't make a sound. Not a single call from my family. And I didn't reach out, either. For the first time, I didn't find myself endlessly scrolling through their social media feeds, trying to piece together their lives from a distance.

　　I just rested. I’d lie in my hospital bed, or I’d drag my aching body down the hall for another test or to settle another bill.

　　Even on my discharge day, I didn't tell anyone. I just packed my few things, gritted my teeth against the throb in my abdomen, and took myself home.

　　The moment I pushed the front door open, the laughter in the living room cut off sharply.

　　Everyone was there. My fiancé, Micah, was sitting right next to Pearl, his arm slung casually over her shoulders. When he saw me, he quickly pulled it back and offered me an awkward smile. ""Soph, you're back? Where did you disappear to these past few days?""

　　My brother, Albi Bennett, let out a derisive snort. ""Where do you think? She just had to skip Pearl's graduation. She can't stand a single day where Vivi is the one in the spotlight.""

　　I didn't say a word. I just started walking toward my room.

　　My silence seemed to throw Albi off. Usually, an accusation like that would have me in tears, desperately pleading my case. But not this time.

　　My mom hurried over, holding a glass of juice. ""Hana, sweetie, we were just so swamped with Vivi's graduation party the other day, we missed your calls. Don't be upset, okay?"" She pressed a glass of cranberry juice into my hand.

　　A dull ache pulsed in my chest, even though I thought I was numb to it.

　　I'm allergic to cranberries. Pearl adores them. Because of that, our house was always stocked with anything cranberry-flavored. No matter how many times I'd mentioned my allergy, no one ever seemed to remember.

　　I handed the glass back to her and took a small step back. ""I'm not mad. I'm just going to my room.""

　　As I turned, a loud crash erupted from the living room.

　　My dad had shot to his feet, slamming his hand on the coffee table. ""What is with that sour face since you walked in?"" he screamed. ""Your mother apologized and even brought you your favorite drink! What more do you want? Looks like we've spoiled you rotten!""

　　My heart twisted so hard it hurt to breathe. Tears welled in my eyes, but I reached out, took the glass from my mom's hand, and drank the entire thing in a few desperate gulps.

　　I set the empty glass down gently and wiped my tears away. I looked my dad squarely in the eye, my voice eerily calm. ""Pearl is the one who likes cranberry juice. I'm allergic to it. But it's fine. I drank it all. May I please go to my room now?""

　　""Hana! Why didn't you say something if you're allergic? Who told you to drink it! You're so stubborn!"" Mom fretted, patting my back nervously.

　　Dad looked momentarily ashamed, but it quickly hardened back into anger. ""You could have just said something! You've always had this unlikable attitude. Nothing like Vivi. She knows how to talk to people properly.""

　　Pearl's sweet voice floated from the couch. ""Dad, please don't talk to Hana like that. You'll upset her."" She sounded so gentle, but the smug triumph in her eyes was unmistakable.

　　Pearl had always used my quiet nature to shine brighter. She lived for these comparisons, only truly satisfied when she saw me crushed beneath her heel.

　　I should have felt hurt. I should have been raging. But all I felt was a hollow, endless numbness. Even this public humiliation couldn't stir a single emotion.

　　""I'm sorry,"" I said, my voice flat. ""It won't happen again.""

　　The moment the words left my mouth, a stunned silence fell over the room. Everyone just stared.

　　My obedience left everyone momentarily stunned. After a heavy pause, my dad was the first to speak, his voice slightly less gruff. ""Good. That's the right attitude. We're family. Everything we do is for your own good.""

　　""I know,"" I replied, the words automatic, a numb smile fixed on my face.

　　Seeing I wasn't going to cause trouble, the tension in the room eased. They turned their attention back to Pearl, and the muted chatter from the living room resumed.

　　I took a quiet breath and moved toward the staircase.

　　But as my foot touched the bottom step, a hand closed around my wrist.

　　Micah had slipped up beside me unnoticed. He leaned in, his voice a low whisper. ""You're really not upset?""

　　That faux-gentle tone made my eyes sting all over again. A wave of bitter hurt rose in my chest, but I could only shake my head, my throat too tight to form words.

　　He looked visibly relieved. ""I knew you'd be understanding. You've never been one to make a scene."" He paused, glancing away uncomfortably. ""Look, there's something I wanted to talk about…""

　　 He avoided my eyes. ""We need to postpone the wedding next week.

　　 I promised your sister a long time ago I'd take her to see the Northern Lights at Aurora Bay after her graduation.

　　 Now that the ceremony's over, she won't stop asking me to keep my word. I thought—why not make it a family trip?

　　 The invitations haven't gone out yet. It's just a date; pushing it back a few weeks doesn't change anything,"" he said, a faint, fond smile touching his lips at the mention of her.

　　My heart froze solid. The tears I'd almost shed moments ago now felt like a pathetic joke.

　　 After 999 times of being cast aside, how could a part of me still hope for anything else?

　　When I didn't respond, Micah grew impatient, running a hand through his hair. ""Come on, Soph. Pearl's never been abroad.

　　 This is a huge deal for her. As her family, we should be there. And you've never seen the Aurora either. Think of it as an early honeymoon.""

　　""Sure,"" I said.

　　He blinked, taken aback. ""What did you say?""

　　I let out a slow, measured breath. ""I said, I agree to cancel the wedding.""

　　""Cancel? Who said anything about canceling? I said postpone. We're not canceling the wedding,"" he corrected, a deep frown forming on his face.

　　I lowered my head. A bitter, hollow smile tugged at my lips. Was there really a difference?

　　 As long as Pearl was around, she would never let this wedding happen. She coveted everything I had.

　　 I'd known this since we were children. It was a fight I could never win.

　　 My family's blind favoritism was her ultimate weapon, and now, my own fiancé had fully joined her ranks.

　　My eyes began to burn, and a familiar, crawling itch spread across my skin. The cranberry juice was finally taking effect.

　　I gave a slight nod and turned to go upstairs. I needed the allergy medication in my room before the reaction got worse.

　　""Are you mad that I'm going to Aurora Bay with Micah?"" Pearl's voice came from behind me, dripping with false innocence.

　　I ignored her and kept walking. This was her classic tactic. Even if I did nothing, a single, well-timed pout from her would rally the entire family to her side.

　　Albi was the first to erupt. ""Hey! Soph! Are you deaf? Vivi is talking to you! First you claim you're not angry, now you're giving everyone the silent treatment. Is that any way to act?""

　　I didn't answer. I was so accustomed to these baseless accusations; my entire life had been filled with them. I had learned to face them with a void of emotion.

　　But just as my foot landed on the second-floor landing, a stinging, sharp impact exploded across my cheek. My head snapped to the side.",1,1764373653.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

I’m 37yo mum of 1, I’ve been toying with the idea of quitting alcohol for a few years now because of the crippling anxiety and self-loathing I get the day after. When it’s bad it’s bad, but then sometimes it’s fine and those are the times I have heard to convince myself there’s no issue, or it’s manageable, but I don’t think it is really.

i don’t drink often at all. The occasional cocktail with a friend, i never drink at home. the issue seems to be work parties, I don’t know when to stop and don’t get me wrong I’ve had some amazingly funny and memorable nights. But I torture myself afterwards with how much I feel like everyone hates me, how I embarrassed myself and I hate myself.

I’m not like that on a normal day, I’m a creature of habit and I like my routine. Coffee, gym etc 

my husband is supportive but he doesn’t seem to get the same response to alcohol, so he takes a very “you’re allowed to let loose and have a night out approach”.

i just don’t want to do it anymore but because I seldom drink I don’t know where to start and I feel awful asking for guidance (or validation) that this is the right thing, and I thought this might be the right community to reach out to?

1p99ua3,https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/11/the-irish-court/,The Irish court,"The ethnic milestones and makeup of the Supreme Court have long been topics of fascination, from the notion of a “Jewish seat” filled by those who followed Justice Louis Brandeis as the first Jewish justice in 1916 to the recognition that Justice Antonin Scalia received as the first Italian American on the court in 1986 to Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s embrace of her role since 2009 as the first Latina to serve. Less attention has been paid to the court’s considerable Irish connections.

Indeed, justices of Irish descent have served on the Supreme Court since its very inception. This included two on the very first court, Justices John Rutledge and James Iredell, and one more appointed by President George Washington, Justice William Paterson, who was the only justice born in Ireland itself. Since then, there have been 22 more Irish-American justices, including four of the current justices (Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett). Overall, slightly more than 20% of the 116 individuals who have served on the court have had Irish heritage.

This was all brought to light last week at a Supreme Court Historical Society event to mark the publication of “[The Emerald Bench: The History of the Irish American Justices on the Supreme Court](https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847874484/).”

Those Irish-American justices and their ancestors who immigrated to the United States or raised their families here through times of hardship and discrimination present “stories of perseverance, determination, courage, and a little bit of luck,” said Sean Meehan, the author of the 255-page coffee-table book published by Rizzoli under the auspices of the historical society and the Irish American Judicial Institute.",1,1764373624.0,UsaNewsLive,0,1.0,False

Last year I would catch her staring at me all the time. My friends and people I don’t know would catch her staring at me. She would make literally any excuse to be around me and when I tell her I have a situation under control that she could go back to doing what she’s doing she would insist on staying with me. So I decided eventually to ask her out and she rejected me. I took it on the chin and decided to stay the same around her and not to make anymore advances. 2 months ago things got.. interesting I guess. Now on top of her staring at me all the time she would bring me coffee everyday. (Now if you know me I’m absolutely obsessed with coffee and I have told everyone in the past that the best way to my heart is through coffee) I chose not to think about it because I didn’t want to get let down again. Her actions this time around has been a bit more flirty with me now she’s poking me or looking for literally any excuse to touch me. So this year she has been more open to going out with me and spending time with me and we FaceTime every so often and she actually offered to give me her number without prompting. So just after Halloween I asked her if she would consider going out with me and she asked me for a few days to consider it and I told her of course that I don’t want to force her into giving me an answer. So I waited a week and had no answer so invited her to a little one on one thing to go and get coffee. As I dropped her off home I asked her if she put any thought into it and she told me how she didn’t want to ruin our whole friend dynamic that we had going and that she’s scared and she’s been hurt in the past. So I told her ok that I respect it and that I won’t pursue her anymore if that’s what she wants and she said yeah… since than every morning she still brings me coffee without me having to ask her she still touches me whenever she gets the chance and I notice that everywhere that I go she would make it subtle about following me. Not in like a stalker way but in like a trying to get in my way so we could talk kind of way. FYI the whole flirty thing is not me saying from just my perspective but other people also mentioning that she is and that she tells everyone no to hanging out and that I have been the only exception to spending time any time outside with.

I reached out to him to see if he wanted to hang out and catch up, and he said yes. i saw him about a week and a half ago, and although it was supposed to be a casual hangout, he kind of insisted to pay for everything (coffee and later paid for our lunch). we met up at 10:30 am and didn’t leave the date until 4 pm. we talked as though no time had passed, and it was so nice to see him! and all of my friends said it was basically a date since he dressed kinda nice and paid for everything we did. we met up for coffee and talked in a park for a couple hours, walked over to a bookstore and wandered for a couple more hours, then we got a late lunch together. 

when we left the date, he texted me first within the hour about the commute back home, and how it was nice to see me and catch up on life. we sent a few messages back and forth, and i was the last person to text.

1p99kes,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1p99kes/how_to_speak_so_people_actually_listen_and/,How to speak so people actually LISTEN (and respect you more),"Look, I've spent way too much time studying how humans communicate. Got deep into psychology research, devoured books on rhetoric, listened to endless communication podcasts, and honestly? Most advice out there is garbage. TikTok influencers telling you to ""just be confident"" or ""speak louder"" like that's some revolutionary insight. It's not. It's lazy.

Here's what I noticed: Most of us struggle with the same thing. We speak, but people don't really hear us. We share ideas in meetings, and they get ignored. We try to set boundaries, and people walk right over them. This isn't some personal failing. It's a skill gap that literally nobody teaches properly in school. The good news? This is completely fixable once you understand the actual science and psychology behind influential communication.

Let me break down what actually works, backed by real research and tested strategies. No fluff. No motivational BS. Just practical tools that'll shift how people respond to you.

# Step 1: Fix your body language before you even open your mouth

Words matter, but here's the kicker: Research from UCLA shows that only 7% of communication effectiveness comes from the actual words you use. The rest? Body language (55%) and tone of voice (38%). That's wild when you think about it.

**Here's what this means practically:**

* **Stand or sit with your spine straight.** Slumped posture signals submission. Your body literally broadcasts ""don't take me seriously"" before you speak. Try the ""power pose"" for two minutes before important conversations. Harvard research by Amy Cuddy showed this actually changes your hormone levels, increasing confidence.

* **Make eye contact, but don't stare like a psychopath.** The sweet spot is holding eye contact for 60-70% of the conversation. Break it naturally when thinking or transitioning topics. Too little eye contact reads as dishonest or insecure. Too much is aggressive.

* **Control your hands.** Fidgeting, playing with your phone, touching your face constantly, these all scream nervousness. Keep your hands visible and use deliberate gestures to emphasize points. Research published in the Journal of Organizational Behavior found that speakers who use purposeful hand gestures are perceived as more competent and persuasive.

* **Take up space.** Don't shrink yourself. Sit back in your chair instead of perching on the edge. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart instead of crossed. This isn't about being aggressive, it's about signaling that you belong in the conversation.

# Step 2: Slow the hell down and embrace pauses

Fast talking kills respect. When you rush through your words, you signal anxiety and uncertainty. Studies from the University of Michigan found that people who speak at a moderate pace (around 150 words per minute) are perceived as more trustworthy and intelligent than fast talkers.

**Strategic pausing is your secret weapon:**

* **Pause before answering questions.** Even just 2-3 seconds. It signals that you're thinking, that your response matters, that you're not desperate to fill silence. Obama does this masterfully. Watch any of his speeches.

* **Pause after making important points.** Let them land. Don't rush to fill the silence. Research from communication expert Nancy Duarte shows that pauses give your audience time to process and signal that what you just said was significant.

* **Lower your pitch at the end of statements.** Uptalk (where your voice goes up at the end like everything's a question?) kills credibility. Margaret Thatcher famously worked with a vocal coach to lower her pitch because research showed lower pitched voices are associated with authority and competence.

# Step 3: Cut the apologetic language and qualifiers

Listen to how often you say ""sorry,"" ""just,"" ""maybe,"" ""kind of,"" ""I think,"" ""does that make sense?"" These are credibility killers. Linguistic research shows that women use these hedging phrases more than men, but everyone does it when they're unsure.

**Replace weak language with declarative statements:**

* Instead of ""I just wanted to share an idea,"" try ""Here's a solution.""
* Instead of ""Sorry to bother you, but could you maybe,"" try ""I need your input on something.""
* Instead of ""I think this might work,"" try ""This will work because.""

The book ""Pitch Perfect"" by Bill McGowan breaks down how these linguistic patterns undermine your message. He worked with executives and found that eliminating qualifiers was the fastest way to increase perceived authority.

# Step 4: Master the art of strategic disagreement

Want to know what really earns respect? Disagreeing intelligently. People who always agree come across as pushovers or yes-men. But there's an art to it.

**The framework that works:**

* **Acknowledge first.** ""That's an interesting perspective"" or ""I see where you're coming from."" This isn't fake. It shows you actually listened.

* **Bridge with curiosity.** ""I'm wondering if we've considered..."" or ""Have you thought about..."" This invites collaboration instead of triggering defensiveness.

* **Present your alternative with evidence.** ""Based on the data from X study"" or ""When we tried this approach before."" Specificity beats vague opinions every time.

Research from the book ""Crucial Conversations"" by Patterson, Grenny, and McMillan shows that skilled communicators make it safe to disagree. They create dialogue instead of debate. The moment someone feels attacked, their brain literally shuts down the reasoning centers. You lose all influence.

# Step 5: Use the power of specificity

Vague communication destroys respect. When you speak in generalities, people tune out. Specificity signals competence and preparation.

**Compare these:**

* Weak: ""We should probably do this soon.""
* Strong: ""I'll have the proposal ready by Thursday at 2pm.""

* Weak: ""This project isn't going well.""
* Strong: ""We're behind on three deliverables: the design mockups due last week, the client presentation scheduled for Monday, and the budget approval we need by month end.""

Studies in organizational psychology show that specific language increases perceived expertise and leadership capability. It's the difference between sounding like you're guessing versus knowing exactly what you're talking about.

# Step 6: Learn to set boundaries without being a dick

This is where most people completely fail. They either become doormats or assholes. There's a middle path.

**The boundary formula:**

* **State the boundary clearly.** ""I can't take on additional projects right now.""
* **Brief explanation if needed.** ""I'm at capacity with current commitments.""
* **Alternative if possible.** ""I could help in two weeks, or I can recommend someone else.""

Notice what's missing? Long apologetic explanations, over justification, hedging. The book ""Set Boundaries, Find Peace"" by Nedra Glover Tawwab emphasizes that boundaries without guilt are what actually get respected. When you apologize excessively for having limits, you're essentially asking permission to have them.

# Step 7: Match your environment's communication style

Context matters. The way you speak in a boardroom should differ from a brainstorming session, which should differ from a one on one coffee chat.

Research in sociolinguistics shows that code switching, adjusting your communication style to your audience, is a sign of high social intelligence. It's not being fake. It's being effective.

**In formal settings:** More structure, less casual language, clear agenda.

**In creative settings:** More collaborative language, open ended questions, building on others' ideas.

**In conflict:** Lower your volume, slow your pace, use more ""I"" statements than ""you"" statements.

The podcast ""WorkLife with Adam Grant"" did an entire episode on this, interviewing organizational psychologists who found that communication flexibility is one of the strongest predictors of leadership success.

# Resources that'll level you up

**Books worth your time:**

* **""Crucial Conversations"" by Patterson, Grenny, and McMillan.** Best seller that's been around for years because it actually works. The authors spent decades researching how people handle high stakes discussions. This book fundamentally changed how I approach difficult conversations. The frameworks are practical, not theoretical. If you read one book from this list, make it this one. This is the best communication book I've ever read.

* **""Talk Like TED"" by Carmine Gallo.** Gallo analyzed the most watched TED talks to figure out what makes certain speakers magnetic. Turns out it's not natural charisma, it's specific techniques anyone can learn. The section on storytelling alone is worth the price. Insanely good read that breaks down the mechanics of influential speaking.

* **""Never Split the Difference"" by Chris Voss.** Written by an FBI hostage negotiator. If these techniques work in life or death situations, they'll work in your staff meetings. The chapter on tactical empathy and calibrated questions is a game changer. This book will make you question everything you think you know about persuasion.

**Apps and tools:**

* **Yoodli.** AI powered communication coach that analyzes your speech patterns, filler words, pace, and gives you concrete feedback. It's like having a speaking coach in your pocket. Works for presentations, interviews, or just practicing tough conversations.

* **BeFreed.** Okay, I need to mention this here because it's been helping me internalize all these communication concepts way faster than just reading books. It's a personalized audio learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google AI experts. What I do is type in something like ""improve my persuasion skills in meetings"" and it generates custom podcast episodes pulling from books, research papers, and expert interviews. The depth is adjustable—sometimes I want a quick 15-minute refresh before a big presentation, other times I do a 40-minute deep dive with specific examples. The voice options are legitimately addictive (I use the deep, thoughtful male voice that sounds like a executive coach). I've been using it during my commute and honestly knocked out way more communication psychology content than I would've otherwise. Makes learning feel less like homework and more like having a smart conversation.

* **Orai.** Another speech analysis app that's particularly good for tracking your progress over time. Shows you patterns you don't even realize you have. The stats on how often you say ""um"" or ""like"" can be brutally eye opening.

* **Finch.** Habit building app that's great for tracking daily communication goals. Want to practice speaking up in meetings more? Set reminders and track your progress. The gamification aspect actually works to build consistency.

**Podcasts that dig deep:**

* **""The Tim Ferriss Show"" episodes on communication.** Ferriss has interviewed everyone from master negotiators to top executives. The episode with Derek Sivers on saying no gracefully changed my entire approach to boundaries.

* **""Hidden Brain"" by NPR.** Shankar Vedantam explores the psychology behind human behavior. Multiple episodes dive into communication patterns and why we misunderstand each other. The episode on conversational blind spots is particularly relevant.

**YouTube channels:**

* **Charisma on Command.** Breaks down body language and communication techniques using examples from movies, interviews, and public figures. Makes it way easier to see these concepts in action.

* **Stanford Graduate School of Business channel.** They post full lectures from their communication courses. The ""Think Fast, Talk Smart"" series by Matt Abrahams is gold for learning to speak more clearly under pressure.

The truth is, nobody's born knowing how to communicate powerfully. It's a skill built through awareness, practice, and strategic adjustment. The people who get heard and respected aren't lucky. They're intentional about how they show up in conversations. Start with one or two techniques from this list, practice them until they feel natural, then add more. Six months from now, you'll notice people responding to you completely differently. That's not magic. That's just what happens when you stop communicating accidentally and start doing it strategically.",1,1764372872.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

No","*This thought was inspired by what could they have done to the Esprit article to ensure it would not lead right back to whomever prepared it.*

AI

It is **virtually impossible to completely prevent a well-trained sniffer dog from detecting human scent** on an item, as dogs have a sense of smell that is orders of magnitude more powerful than a human's. Scents are composed of microscopic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are shed constantly and adhere to all surfaces, and dogs are trained to detect even minute quantities of a specific scent. 

Commonly attempted ""masking"" methods, such as using coffee grounds, strong spices, or perfumes, are largely ineffective because a dog can easily discern the target scent amidst other odors (much like a human can spot a red ball among many white balls). 

The most effective way to minimize human scent is through rigorous decontamination and airtight sealing processes, which still may not be entirely foolproof. 

Methods to Minimize Scent Contamination

These methods aim to prevent the transfer of scent in the first place, rather than masking it, and are primarily used in controlled, forensic-level scenarios: 

* **Use gloves and sterile equipment:** Wear multiple pairs of gloves and change them frequently to avoid transferring skin cells and oils during handling.
* **Employ a fluid barrier and vacuum sealing:** Place the item inside a high-quality, odor-proof, vacuum-sealed bag. This process should be repeated in a new, clean environment to prevent contamination of outer layers.
* **Use solvents for decontamination:** Clean the exterior of the sealed package with both polar and non-polar solvents (like rubbing alcohol or paint thinner) to remove any residual scent molecules.
* **Work in a clean environment:** The entire process should take place in a room that has been thoroughly decontaminated, as scent molecules can linger in the air and on surfaces. 

Ultimately, a trained dog's olfactory system is incredibly sophisticated, and successfully tricking it is highly unlikely in real-world scenarios.

I run a small business and I’ve been having a rough time trying to get consistent sales and keep my name out there. I genuinely love what I do and I’ve worked hard to build something I’m proud of, but lately it feels like I’m doing everything I can and still not getting enough visibility to grow.

Recently, an influencer reached out after seeing my business in a magazine feature. (I’ve been in four magazines, which still blows my mind and is something I’m really proud of.) She told me she loved what she read and has been wanting to post about me… but then she quoted me $400 for one Reel and a 24‑hour Story.

On one hand, I know influencers charge for their platform and their time. There is a chance I’d get more orders and more eyes on my brand.

On the other hand… my business is struggling.
Money is tight.
And $400 feels like a huge gamble when there’s no guarantee it will pay off.

So I’m stuck between:
    •    “Invest in yourself this could help you grow.”
and
    •    “Don’t risk money you can’t afford to lose.”

This whole situation made me wonder what other small business owners would do.

Is paying influencers actually worth it anymore?

And honestly, I have a bigger question I need help with:

How do YOU get your business name out there without spending a ton of money?

What’s worked for you?
What actually moved the needle?

I’ve tried being proactive. I’ve reached out to:
    •    local coffee shops
    •    bakeries
    •    small businesses
    •    stores
    •    places that carry local products

…but I’ve been shut down or ignored almost every time. I feel like I’m doing the right thing by putting myself out there, but hearing “no” repeatedly gets discouraging. I don’t know if I’m approaching the wrong places, the wrong way, or if this is just part of the journey.

On top of that, weekend markets only go so far. They’re great, but:
    •    they’re inconsistent
    •    weather can ruin everything
    •    they take up the whole day
    •    and they don’t always lead to steady income

So I’d also love advice on:

What opportunities exist outside of weekend markets?

What have YOU done to grow beyond just markets?

Things I’m curious about:
    •    partnerships with cafés
    •    wholesale opportunities
    •    selling through boutiques or local stores
    •    pop-ups in apartment complexes
    •    collabs with other small businesses
    •    catering, corporate orders, or events
    •    seasonal festivals
    •    subscription boxes or monthly specials
    •    online ordering or pick-up
    •    email marketing
    •    literally anything that has helped you grow

I really want to keep pushing and get more people to find me, but right now I feel stuck between wanting to invest in visibility and being scared to waste money I need for survival.

Any advice, experiences, or suggestions would mean a lot.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

I stacked a few tables and found a really tall chair. I made myself a perch and now I sit up there. I listen to recordings of 90’s Princeton Philosophy, drink my coffee, and I stare. 

Found a Full Moon, a perfect circle shaped puzzle, at my local Saver’s thrift. This puzzle is a son-of-a-bitch, but on the table at the top, the one shaped like an octagon- what a coincidence! it fits. 

What form is this? And why does it feel so right? Sitting up here, well into the night. A greyscale nightmare slowly comes into sight. 

Piece by piece I begin to see the light of a most apt metaphor for my life. 

(Spoon-fed, I know). 

What if, after all of this work I do, what if my my moon is missing a piece or two? All that work towards an object complete- what should have been concise and already defined, incomplete and nery satisfied? 

Do I see it through, now having had this sudden revelation? What is progress if I already know what comes next? In this life, there are no guarantees. Who buys a thrift store puzzle expecting all the pieces, anyway? 





The moon is as it presents and no one tells us why. This is what we accept; our hush hush, human agreement. If our moon were comprised of 2D puzzle shaped pieces, with a missing piece or two, no one would think twice.

No, I prefer the choice and the chance and the rhythm of the tune. In this I find true romance under a slowly developing, painstakingly difficult 5000 piece round puzzle of the moon. 

I will see it through.

BLACKTHORN STREET
By Nekro


ACT ONE: THE MARK
SCENE 1: THE DISCOVERY

VOICE (Opening narration - seductive, dangerous)
Picture a street where everyone pretends they belong. Where ring cameras watch neighbors like prison guards. Where the coffee costs eight dollars and nobody knows each other's names. Blackthorn Street. Three AM. And someone or something, just marked every door but one.

SFX: Morning birds. Coffee maker. Phone notification dings.

JUNE (breathing fast, panicked)
Guys. GUYS. Check your doorsteps. Right now. I'm not joking—check your fucking doorsteps!

MARCUS (groggy, annoyed)
June, it's six in the morning. Some of us have Zoom calls,

JUNE...

MARCUS. There's a symbol burned into my door. Like burned. The wood is charred and it smells like... I don't even know. Sulfur? Check. Your. Door.

SFX: Footsteps running. Door opening. Sharp intake of breath.

MARCUS
...Holy shit.

VERA (over neighborhood group chat audio/speakerphone)
Everyone stay calm. I'm seeing it too. It's on my door. It's on the Chens' door. Has anyone checked Old Man Kade's shop?

OLD MAN KADE (gravelly, amused)
Oh, I'm marked, Vera. Beautiful work, really. Haven't seen a Solomon's Seal variation this sophisticated since 1979. Whoever did this knows what they're doing.

MARCUS
Okay, WHAT? Solomon's what? This is vandalism. I'm calling the cops.

JUNE
I already tried. My phone's dead. Completely dead. It was at ninety percent.

VERA
Mine too.

MARCUS
That's... that's not possible. They're different carriers.

OLD MAN KADE
Check every door, children. Count the marks. Then tell me whose is missing.

SFX: Footsteps on pavement. Multiple doors opening and closing.



SCENE 2: THE ACCUSATION

JUNE (out of breath)
I counted eleven doors. Eleven marks. There are twelve houses on this block.

MARCUS
So someone's not marked. Someone on this street did this.

VERA
Or they're protected. The mark could be protection, and whoever doesn't have it is the target.

JUNE
Or whoever doesn't have it is the one who PUT them there!

OLD MAN KADE
Interesting theories. Who wants to knock on doors and ask who's been spared?

MARCUS
This is insane. There's a rational explanation. Gas leak, shared hallucination, coordinated prank.

VERA
Then explain why my shadow is facing the wrong direction, Marcus.

SFX: Dead silence.

MARCUS
...What?

VERA
Look down. Right now. All of you. Look at your shadows.

SFX: Shuffling. Small gasps.

JUNE (whispering)
Mine's... it's not moving with me. Oh god, it's not moving with me!

MARCUS
There's, there's a scientific, light refraction, multiple light sources.

OLD MAN KADE (laughing softly)
Keep telling yourself that, boy. Meanwhile, your shadow just waved at me.

VOICE (narration)
Shadows that disobey. Phones that die in unison. And twelve neighbors who suddenly realize they never really trusted each other at all. Somewhere, something is laughing. Can you hear it?




ACT TWO: THE UNRAVELING (Pages 6-11)
SCENE 3: THE INVESTIGATION

MARCUS
Okay. Okay. Let's think. We go door to door. We figure out who's not marked. Then we get answers.

JUNE
And if they don't want to show us?

VERA
We're past asking permission, honey.

SFX: Knocking on door. Door creaking open.

MARCUS
Hey, we're checking—everyone's checking their front doors. There's been some vandalism. Can you just confirm if you have a burned symbol on yours?

NEIGHBOR (muffled, distant)
Yes. It's there. Now leave me alone.

SFX: Door slams.

JUNE
That's eight confirmed. Four to go.

SFX: More knocking. Another door.

VERA
Mrs. Chen? It's Vera from number seven. Can you open up?

MRS. CHEN (through door, scared)
I don't want trouble. It's on my door. The mark is on my door.

JUNE (whispering)
She sounds terrified.

OLD MAN KADE
Fear is contagious. More dangerous than any hex.

SFX: Walking. Another door. Knocking.

MARCUS
Last house. Number twelve. If they don't have it.

SFX: Door opens slightly.

JUNE
Hi! We're just, we're checking on everyone. There's been this weird.

RESIDENT (cold)
I know what's happening. And I didn't do it. My door is marked. Check for yourself.

SFX: Footsteps. Examination sounds.

VERA
She's right. It's there.

MARCUS
Then who, wait. Wait. We didn't check Kade's shop properly.

OLD MAN KADE (suddenly serious)
Excuse me?

MARCUS
You said you were marked. But your shop has two doors. Front and back. We only checked the front.



SFX: Tense silence.
SCENE 4: THE ACCUSATION TURNS

JUNE
Marcus... what are you saying?

MARCUS
I'm saying he runs an occult shop. I'm saying he's the only one who recognized that symbol. I'm saying he knew exactly what it was called without hesitation. Solomon's Seal? What even IS that?

OLD MAN KADE (quiet, dangerous)
You want to know what it is, boy? It's a binding. A summoning circle. And whoever drew twelve of them on this street is trying to trap something. Or summon it. The question you should be asking is: why eleven marks of containment... and one door of entry?

VERA
Entry for what?

OLD MAN KADE
Whatever's casting those shadows.

SFX: A low, unnatural hum begins. Barely perceptible.

JUNE
Do you guys hear that?

MARCUS
I don't hear anything.

JUNE
No, there's, it's like... humming. Like something's vibrating underneath us.

VERA (panicking)
My nose is bleeding. Why is my nose bleeding?

MARCUS
Vera, calm down.

VERA
Don't tell me to calm down! This is real! This is HAPPENING! And you're standing there accusing Kade when you're the only one who doesn't BELIEVE in any of this! Maybe that's why you're not affected! Maybe the mark doesn't work on skeptics!

MARCUS
That's not, that's not how reality works!

JUNE (building hysteria)
Then explain it! EXPLAIN WHY MY SHADOW IS WALKING TOWARD ME!

SFX: Footsteps stumbling backward.

OLD MAN KADE
Everyone STOP.

SFX: The humming intensifies, then cuts off suddenly.

OLD MAN KADE
Listen to yourselves. This is what it wants. The division. The fear. The accusations. We're doing its work for it.

MARCUS
What is ""it""?

OLD MAN KADE
I don't know. But I know what we summoned the moment we started pointing fingers.

VOICE (narration)
Humans. So predictable. Give them a mystery and they'll create a monster. Give them fear and they'll devour each other. On Blackthorn Street, the real burning hasn't even started yet.




ACT THREE: THE REVELATION (Pages 12-15)
SCENE 5: THE TRUTH
SFX: Wind picking up. Unnatural whispers underneath.

JUNE (voice shaking)
Okay. New theory. What if... what if none of us are safe? What if the marks aren't protection OR target? What if they're just... counting us?

VERA
Counting us for what?

JUNE
I don't know! A sacrifice? A ritual? Kade, you said this was sophisticated. What would someone need twelve people for?

OLD MAN KADE (reluctant)
Twelve is... significant. Twelve hours. Twelve signs. Twelve disciples. Twelve gates to.

MARCUS
Gates to what?

SFX: A door creaks open slowly. No one opened it.

ALL
(Various gasps, shocked silence)

VERA (whispering)
That's... that's my door. I didn't touch it.

SFX: More doors opening. One by one. Eleven doors.

MARCUS
This isn't real. This ISN'T REAL.

JUNE
Marcus, shut up! Kade, what do we do?

OLD MAN KADE
The twelfth door. We need to find the twelfth door. The one that isn't marked. That's the door that opened this.

VERA
But we checked! Everyone's marked!

JUNE (revelation)
No. No, we didn't check the shop's back door. Marcus was right. Kade, show us your back door.

OLD MAN KADE (pause)
...That would be unwise.

MARCUS
WHY?

OLD MAN KADE
Because I've kept it sealed for forty years. And if what I think is happening is happening, breaking that seal now would be.

SFX: A massive CRACK. Wood splintering. From Kade's shop.

OLD MAN KADE
too late.



SCENE 6: THE CHOICE
SFX: A deep, resonant voice emerges from the shop. Not quite human. Layered.

THE THING
Twelve marks. Eleven doors opened. One door sealed by fear. And fear... is the oldest key.

JUNE (crying)
What do you want?!

THE THING
Want? I want nothing. I was invited. Drawn by suspicion. Fed by accusation. Birthed by your certainty that someone among you was guilty. You opened every door yourselves.

MARCUS
We didn't, we didn't open anything!

THE THING
Didn't you? When you accused Kade? When you doubted each other? Every suspicion was a word of summoning. Every fear was a line in the circle. You drew me here with your own darkness.

VERA (quiet, broken)
So what happens now?

THE THING
Now? Now I give you a choice. One of you can take the mark. Voluntarily. Burn it into your own flesh. Claim the darkness you've already embraced. And I'll leave the rest of you alone.

SFX: Silence. Breathing.

THE THING
Or refuse... and I'll mark you all. Starting with your children. Then your parents. Then everyone you've ever loved on every street in this city. Blackthorn is just the beginning.

MARCUS
That's... you're lying. You're manipulating us,

THE THING
Am I? Or am I simply showing you what you already are?

OLD MAN KADE (stepping forward)
I'll take it.

VERA
Kade, no.

OLD MAN KADE
I've lived long enough. And I'm the one who failed to keep that door sealed. This is mine to carry.

JUNE
There has to be another way!

OLD MAN KADE
There isn't. There never is. Not when you've already invited the devil to dinner.

SFX: Footsteps. The sound of flesh burning. A scream that cuts off into silence.

THE THING (fading, satisfied)
One volunteer. One sacrifice. One willing participant in the dark. Blackthorn Street is spared. For now. But remember, mortals, I didn't force this choice. You made it. Just like you made every choice that led here.

SFX: Wind dies. Doors slam shut simultaneously. Normal sounds return.



SCENE 7: THE AFTERMATH
SFX: Morning sounds. Birds. Distant traffic.

MARCUS (numb)
His shop is empty. Like he was never there.

VERA
The marks are gone too. From all the doors.

JUNE
My phone works again. Everything's... normal.

MARCUS
So it was real.

VERA
It was always real, Marcus. You just didn't want to see it.

JUNE (distant)
Do you think he's... dead?

VERA
I don't know. Maybe death would be kinder.

SFX: Footsteps walking away. One by one, they separate.


VOICE (closing narration)
Blackthorn Street. Where the coffee costs eight dollars and nobody knows each other's names. Where ring cameras watch neighbors like prison guards. Where twelve people learned that the monsters we fear most are the ones we create ourselves. Old Man Kade took the mark. But the question that should keep you awake at night is this: if something knocked on your door at three AM and asked you to choose between your darkness and everyone else's... what would you burn?

Welcome to Blackthorn Street. 
Population: Eleven. 
Your shadow is waiting.

SFX: A match striking. Then silence.

Long story short, she came up to me in graduate school randomly and asked if she could get me a sweet treat. I said yes. Following week, she followed up to clarify I’d be there, and she brought me a croissant. This felt like an invitation for friendship so I got her number and immediately we planned a picnic where we did art and ate fruit. She invited me into her juggling and circus hobby, and we got to know each other over the course of 8 months or so. I was having a hard time while finishing grad school, and she said she was happy to support me and to be a listening ear. I felt like I was the only one asking to hang over the months. We spent time together maybe once a month going to her favorite coffee and bakery places but only when I proposed we hang. When asked, she’d usually say “Absolutely!” But never asked me. One day, same as always, I asked if we could hang as it had been awhile. She said “I’m trying to be more mindful of my free time.” I was offended but kept it to myself and told her I got it. After a few months, I proposed we try a pizza place that was a favorite of mine, but she let me know she “Didnt see herself spending one on one time” with me. I asked for more clarification and she said she didn’t want to give the wrong idea— mind you, I never asked or hinted at anything romantic. She said she still would be happy to have friendly interactions in group settings. I felt very offended and confused and told her space is best for now. After 3 weeks, she came up to me and asked me to “please say hi” and looked very sad. I’ve been confused and tried to sort things out over texts since it got awkward, I asked for compromise since our needs seem opposed to each other, and she said “these are my boundaries and it’s unfair for you to ask me to change them. We can have group interactions. Hopefully you can respect that.” 
I was very hurt and didn’t receive any clarity as to what led to this and I made it clear this was giving me anxiety and i couldn’t just go up to her and smile and have fun at juggling. It’s been over 7 months of us occasionally texting— me asking for clarity or how we can resolve the tension. She mentioned along the way she feels tension “anywhere we share space.”
Last I texted her 3 weeks ago asking if we could have a phone call when she’s ready to sort this out and reach an understanding— even if it’s just a clear “let’s refrain from interacting” going forward… but instead she said “I’m sorry to be ignoring you, I want to give a thoughtful response, but I’ve just been so busy.” And shes left it at that. I am near certain she is an ISTJ. Back when we were close, she got this result, the Si/Te suits her “staying busy” coping mechanisms, and I believe shes heavily guarding Fi. Do any ISTJs here have any insight you can give me on what might be going on that I’m not getting? Based off what I read, dont ISTJs usually prefer clarity? This has been hurting me so badly and I wish I could just let it go and take the silence as an answer but I feel something is not right here.

The smell is like death, literally, like a rodent died in the hot water tank. This was my first horrified thought because I'm making the tea from a dedicated hot water tap attached to a coffee maker at work. I have no idea where exactly the water is coming from. However, after dumping the first brew, I made a jin jun mei to test if it was the water, and that smelled and tasted perfectly fine. Later, I tried the duck shit, and the smell came back! I went back to the tap and poured some plain hot water in a cup. I sat there smelling it and wafting like it was a damn fine wine, but there was no hint of the death smell whatsoever. I let the water cool off in case the temperature was masking the scent. No such luck. The water smells perfectly fine.

It's a few hours later and I still have a napkin on my desk that I'd set a drippy part of my tea infuser on after making the duck shit. That slightly damp napkin? Smells like death.

—Deck 6 Aft is underutilized. A couple of nice quiet bars back there. The wine bar is usually empty.

—Coffee is pretty meh, but there’s usually not a long line at Starbucks, which has the same prices and menu as the states.

—Stateroom staff are great, but overworked. Your room will be made up once a day. (I tipped $40 the first day).

—IMO, the Observation Lounge has the best bar tenders. Not too busy, take their time, happy to chat. 

—Drinks are easy to get. Never had to look hard for a bar or wait in line long. 

—The buffet is a pretty wild scene, especially for breakfast, but the other restaurants are usually much less crowded. Cruisers love their buffets!

—There is a water bottle fill station near the back of the buffet (deck 17). You can also use the water fill station in the Observation Lounge, just fill a glass and then pour the glass in your bottle.

—Another typically quiet space is outside the bar on deck 8.

—Across the board, the food has been well prepared, but you can definitely tell they are on a budget. This is not meant as a complaint, just is what it is.

—Don’t sleep on the oatmeal at the breakfast buffet!

—Gluten free bagels are available in the buffet, as are GF hamburger buns.

—We got the all you can drink Starbucks and alcohol packages and had not problem getting our money’s worth, so to speak. And we’re not big consumers of either.

—Indulge Food Hall worked great for us. Seating always available and the food is the best on the ship, IMO. The menu does not change though, so it’s not really an every night thing.

—Kids programming was pretty meh, but we’re used to Disney, so not sure that is a fair critique.

—The ship is beautiful and very clean. 

—We got a balcony room. Seems smaller than other ships, but we’ve been cruising Disney lately so not sure that’s an apples to apples comparison. 

—Not a massive fan of the layout, but you do get used to it and it kind of grows on you. At first, walking through restaurants to get to restaurants is strange/Confusing but, like I said, you get used to it.

—The Prince show was pretty bad, TBH. A bunch of dudes grinding on each other for like 30 minutes bookended by pretty rough singing. Super weird... Anyway, get there 45 minutes early if you want a seat.

—Price is Right was fun. Make a reservation when you board. The theater seats about 500.

—The upscale restaurants require long pants for men. Yes, I found this out the hard way…lol.

—Disembarkation is on level 4. We had no issues in this regard. Thought it was organized well enough. 

—Board games are available opposite the bar on deck 8 mid ship.

—Mini golf and ping pong are is super fun. Arcade is also well done with free vintage games—Pac Man, etc.

Anyway, a few stream of consciousness observations and tips. Hope you enjoy your trip.",15,1764372062.0,NCL,7,0.94,False

I'd like a spot with easy access from Milan (airport), and then easy access to Innsbruck.

I generally enjoy medium-city large-town vibes, and I'm hoping to find places that aren't super catered to tourists (although I realize I'm a tourist myself). I enjoy having a good food, coffee, and bar (or wine) scene, and may also try to take a half-day nature trip if I can. I'd also like to make sure they're nice places to visit in the winter, especially since I enjoy walking around and admiring old buildings and interesting architecture.

I haven't visited Italy before, and I want to plan a longer trip in the future when I can, but for now I only have a few days in the north and want to make the most of it.

  
Current contenders:

* Verona - seems the most ideal for transit, I read many rave reviews (and people really like the architecture), but I also read that there's a lot of tourism.
* Milan - I could just stay in Milan for a few days, but I was hoping to have a smaller city vibe.
* Bozen / Trento - I see these as stops on the train from Milan/Verona to Innsbruck, but I haven't read too much into them yet.
* Bologna (or other surrounding cities) - Seems like this is a great region for food and wine, but it would be a bit of a detour.

I'm also happy to take other suggestions, and would gladly accept any other nuggets of advice for the region!",2,1764371887.0,ItalyTravel,7,1.0,False

She’s a lot younger. He has a very pretty face and nice smile but honestly I’m only mildly physically attracted to her, her personality is really what I’m crushing over. She’s incredibly nice and sweet. So much that I think she might like me too but I’m really her boss’s boss so I don’t know if it’s just cause of my position. She’ll randomly do nice things for me too like bring me food and coffee which she doesn’t do for anyone else except for her girl friends she works with. From what I gather she didn’t do that for who had my role before me.

English isn’t her first language but she speaks it pretty well. I’ve been trying to learn Spanish and she goes out of her way to teach me words and test me on them. 

The weird thing is she always refers to my wife and son. Like asks me how they are. I haven’t been with my wife for sometime, long before I ever met her. I’ve told her that we’re not together anymore after the first time she’s brought her up. I feel weird but I want to explain to her that I’m not married anymore but that’s an odd conversation to have with an employee. 

There nothing I could do with her even if she likes me. I can’t risk my job, she would have to leave for us to be together and I have no idea if she even has any feelings for me.

Regardless it’s made going to work 1000% more tolerable. But my thoughts of her are living in my head and drive me crazy cause I want to talk with her all of the time. Nothing will come of this, I just have to get it off my chest.

1p9943c,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p9943c/hm_sf_levity/,[HM] [SF] Levity,"I'd like to start this by affirming that I had no idea that the position held by Gravity was vacatable. That one day, Gravity might leave a note on their desk saying they can no longer put up with the job, so they're putting it down—that is to say, no longer putting things down. I never thought the job would be hard. I mean c'mon, think of the perks. The honor that comes with the status as a fundamental force, oh wait, that was mentioned in the note, ""I'm not a force! I'm a curvature in space-time. It's just a consequence of how... Never mind! No one understands me anyway..."" Well, there are other perks, but they must not be worth sticking around for.  

So be it then. I tried to drop the note, but instead it just floated in front of me. Going through the day will be interesting. When will Gravity find a replacement?  

There's a noise coming from the window in the front room. It sounds like shouting. People must be panicking about the sudden resignation. My toes miss the corner of my coffee table that I always seem to kick. Instead, since it's floating a foot in the air, the table connects with my knee then flies away. I try to rub my knee as it starts to throb. I limp to the window, or bounce really, and peer outside.  

My neighbor, Mr. Fineline, is in his yard doing a one-handed handstand on top of a garden gnome. Hang on, that's not right. He's 300lbs, and that didn't come from going to the gym. He's gripping onto the garden gnome in order to keep himself from flying away from the ground. He's shouting, ""Show me the statute! Show me where it says levitation counts as occupancy! Property taxation is theft!”. 

Every breath of air he takes sends a ripple through his body like gelatin. Now that his folds aren't weighed down anymore, he appears to be twice as nimble, and twice as big. Leave it to him to find the upshot of a situation.  

As I stare out the window, a chill comes over me. I look down and see that my robe has flown up behind me and has completely exposed me to anyone who has happened to look at my house. I quickly get a hold of all the fleeting and floating folds of fabric and rush into the kitchen. I haven't had my morning coffee yet. When I look at the counter, I am just in time to see the coffee machine with a clock starter kick on. I stare in disbelief as the machine blasts off the counter. The percolator acts as a rocket and sends hot coffee and grounds trailing behind it. 

I'm not dismayed by this. I am determined to get my morning coffee. I kick off the ground like a missile and aim for a floating globe of coffee. My body does a fly-by, and I stick my lips out like a straw trying to get a sip of the dark orb. As I near the other side of the kitchen, I land one foot on the wall and the other on the ceiling and kick off again. The coffee machine has started to orbit the ceiling fan scattering more globules of coffee across the kitchen. Then there's me, bouncing off the kitchen surfaces, the counter, the upper cabinets, and the ceiling. Chasing the caffeine beads like a cat chasing a laser pointer. 

At one point I'm lying flat on the ceiling as a stream of coffee heads straight towards my face. My mouth is agape waiting to be rewarded for estimating the stream's trajectory. Mr. Fineline floats past my kitchen window, no longer holding onto that garden gnome. He's now holding a Xerox machine in one arm, looking at documents in the other, and is pinching a phone between his shoulder and his ear yelling into it. ""My mortgage says 'land-based structure', and guess what? No land, no mortgage! Remove me from your records, or I'll sue."" 

I chuckle a bit. He seems to be the only person poised to act on the financial benefits of zero gravity. 

Suddenly, a new force steps into Gravity's old office and sits in the roller chair. The replacement is like Gravity but isn't used to the cosmic level of command that comes with the office. The roller chair doesn’t quite accommodate the new force’s size, so they reach down to the height lever and give it a slight tug. But instead of bringing the chair down to a more reasonable height, the chair quickly rolls to the side. In my kitchen, I am thrown against the wall. Just outside, Mr. Fineline is ejected from view, headed straight for the upper atmosphere.  

The new force must have lied on their resume. ",1,1764371637.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I felt guilty because if i didn’t go she would’ve been alone. Her only other child, my twin (mtf) is no contact with her since last Christmas. She went on a long transphobic rant then about how my twin would always be their son and she’s only ever calling them by their deadname. Mind you she’s also known my preferred name and pronouns for 3 years now (have really been out for 11, but coming out to a narcissist is terrifying).

I got to her house a little after 1 and poured myself a cup of coffee. Almost immediately she asked if my twin was in town. I said no, and tried to change the subject. She asked where they were living now, and i said i don’t know. she said “i can tell when you’re lying, you know, tell me”. I decided to be honest and say “they haven’t spoken to you for a year for a reason, they do not want you to know where they live.” and this set her off. She went on about how we’re both so ridiculous about the “gender thing” and she “did so much for us” we need to just understand and respect that she’s not going to call us our names. I could go on about what was said but I only put up with about 10 minutes of it before i decided to leave. 

I left and sat in my car for about 5 minutes, before realizing i had left my food, my fancy cold brew, and supplies for my baking business there and decided to go back in for it. i was almost out the door without incident, she was in her room, when she met me at the door with “you know i’m going to kill myself, right?” and blocked me from leaving. she went on about how i’m treating her horribly and she “can’t go on like this”.  When she let me leave I drove across the street and called my partner and my dad to calm down, and ultimately decided to call 911 based on the threat of suicide. 

She must’ve had a 6th sense that i was calling 911 cause right when i hung up she texted me “im not going to hurt myself, don’t worry” along with some other stuff about how im being ridiculous and cruel. but at that point a sherif had already pulled up to her house. i texted her back and let her know i already called 911. she said “call them back and tell them you lied” umm that’s not how that works. 

ultimately she convinced the paramedics and sheriffs she was fine. the sheriff called me directly and said they can’t do anything about a verbal threat if she’s denying it, but i could try to get the coroner to involuntarily commit her. at that point i just went home and slept. 

i feel it’s time to go NC again, but im 3 months pregnant and just want my mom. or what i want my mom to be. 
if you chit this far thank you for reading. 

tldr: NMom threatened suicide after i maintained a boundary. called a wellness check on her and she lied her way out of it. ",69,1764371275.0,raisedbynarcissists,21,0.99,False

1p98u1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1p98u1y/my_mil_lies_about_everything/,MY MiL lies about everything,"Hi! First time posting here. I just need to get some insight/outside opinions. 

I’m f40 and my MiL (and my husband’s relationship with her) is my biggest problem right now. 

I know my MiL lies. I’ve caught her in several little lies since I’ve known her. Here’s what happened. 

We used to go up and visit my MiL every week. She allows my daughter to sip out of her water bottle when they are together. My daughter is now just over 2.5yrs old. When I first noticed her drinking from my MiL’s water bottle I asked my husband if it had flavored sweetner in it, because I know my MiL likes to drink her water that way. My husband said he asked her and she said no. Ok fine. I was still suspicious bc I know she lies. As more visits went by I noticed how my daughter GUZZLED my MiL’s water. Every time my MiL would say, “oh there must be something special about grandma’s water” With her stupid little grin. I let it slide a couple times but the fact that she was lying to us infront of my daughter really pissed me off. I told my husband and he didn’t see it as a big problem. (Side note: my husband constantly gave me sh*t when I used to put fake sweetner in my coffee….but now that his mom is giving it to our toddler it’s ok….?). I even tried a sip of my MiL’s water behind her back to confirm my suspicions, and of course it was sweetened. I had my husband try it too and it was so sweet he pulled a face as though he’d eaten a sour lemon. anyway, it became a big enough problem between us that he said something to his mom. (Hey mom, what’s that stuff you put in your water? We’re not going to give that to our daughter). Ok. Great. I feel better now. The next time we go to her house my MiL makes a big show of emptying her water bottle and putting fresh water in. She did that once. The following visit our daughter was guzzling from her water bottle again and the same stupid little lies came out of my MiL’s mouth. I didn’t say anything, just to keep the F’n peace. But my daughter would come home and her pee would be Electric yellow like she had an energy drink or she’d complain of a stomach ache, and even once she got diarrhea from it. I told my husband my worries again and he said, why would she lie about it. I finally asked my MiL in front of my husband, if she put anything in it, of course she said no and my husband even defended her. I was still suspicious and told my husband, so he said, fine, try her water..so I tried it. Of course it was sweetened. I gave a sip to my husband and he was hurt and disappointed (in his mother) because he truly believed her and didn’t see her as a liar. So I asked him what are we going to do? He said he’ll talk to her. Now, we are more currently pissed off that she’s lying to us, especially after we told her we don’t want our daughter drinking that stuff. And she’s lying infront of our daughter, teaching her that it’s ok to lie. My husband tells his mom that we are trying to teach our daughter to be honest….that was his roundabout way of telling his mom to stop lying about the water. Of course it didn’t work. My MiL still gives our daughter her flavored sweetened water and tells us it’s just something special. 

Now, my husband is afraid to confront his mom or make her mad. She is vindictive and childish when she gets “hurt.” She has given us the silent treatment and slammed doors when we’ve tried to have an adult conversation about stuff. He even said to me, “don’t get on my mom’s bad side.” My problem is I can’t let this go anymore. I feel like she needs to know that I will stand up to her especially when it involves my child. I am worried it will affect my relationship with my husband….but the relationship is being affected either way. I don’t know if I should talk to my MiL in person, phone call or text. I don’t know if I should tell my husband I’m going to do it or if I should just do it without his “permission.”

Anyway, sorry for the long post. Thank you for reading this far. I would appreciate any helpful thoughts you might have.

1p98sed,https://www.reddit.com/r/RecordStoreDay/comments/1p98sed/rsd_etiquettetodays_experience/,RSD Etiquette/Today’s Experience,"So I and two of my friends planned for RSD and had a few ISO’s that were going to be very sought after so we got to our local record store at 10:30 PM thanksgiving night (it’s a small town so thankfully we don’t have to line up way earlier). Upon getting there, there were only 4 people ahead of us. Two on the sidewalk in sleeping bags and blankets with a portable space heater, and in front of them were two empty chairs right by the door to the store so they were first. 

Across from the empty chairs there was a truck running parked right in front of them; we figured whoever was in the first two spots just went in their truck for a short bit to warm up. However, from the time we got there at 10:30 to the time the store opened 9.5 hours later at 8AM, they came out of their truck ONCE to walk down the street to the gas station for a coffee. Mind you the rest of the line is sitting outside on the sidewalk in 26 degree weather freezing our asses off.

Then it gets worse because once the store opens, the husband and wife that sat in their truck all night grabbed one of each popular title (the wife grabbing one and then grabbing a second and passing it to her husband). A few of these titles my store only even got 2 copies of because they’re a small store in a small town. 

Luckily me and my friends got everything we wanted but i felt so bad for the girl and her boyfriend in front of me in the sleeping bags, because the married couple that sat in their truck all night grabbed the only two copies of one of the titles she wanted most and specially camped out for.

Am I overreacting or is this BS? It just all around seemed disrespectful to the rest of us who did RSD ethically and respectful of each other. We politely asked the store owner at one point in the night if that was allowed and he basically said he didn’t mind. I think he’s just too kind and appreciates the business/support regardless but… my friends and I definitely mind lol and the two people in front of us were upset as well. Anyways I just needed to rant but I think I’ll be going to a different record store from now on

**Here’s a few scenarios…**

-She does everything she can to act like she’s not into me when co workers tease her about me. When I dropped her off home I actually don’t feel she has any feelings for me compared to at work 

 -she’s told me im “handsome” 4 times?

-Playfully punches me 

-At work she’s whispered in my ear “let’s go on break together without saying anything”, told me to fix her hair, often stations herself so she’s next to me, she does these things when people aren’t watching..

-her lift home was absent for a few days so she asked me to drop her off home saying “ its our secret don’t tell anyone else” she wanted to stop to buy some groceries (red flag right, am I being used”? when I told her I told someone I dropped her off home she got really shy , laughing / but paranoid about it.  There’s literally other people like woman she’s close too that she could ask to drop her off home to avoid gossip but she still chooses me in this secret manner 

Other than that time she had no lift shes never asked me for any favours…and offered to bring me food for work

-When dropping her off she’s also planned to go random places like eat somewhere or mall but got tired and just asked me to take her home instead

-The next week she told me quietly  “I miss you dropping me off I enjoy it it’s our secret “She never wants me to drop her off at her house only across the highway so no one sees…(dunno if she’s married!!??) but has claimed the entire time to me she’s single 

-I asked her this week why she didn’t get any sleep and she said “Im thinking of you”  giggling then said jk 

-She always messages me first not me. Our convos are really short and basic like 3 sentences. But now shes suddenly calling me..shes not really good at typing English 

-She also asked me where I was on break one time cause I was at a different cafeteria and all of a sudden the next day she walked all the way there only because I was there and even told me this …

-This week she was asking what my parents house looks like then I asked “Do you want to come to my house lol” then she said “No….”

-she said she has a cousin she will introduce me to Thats looking for a bf and to add her as a friend, she asked me if I have a gf” i said no and she said “We will talk about it later” all of a sudden she never talked about it again lol??

- one time I saw her recording me on her phone then she suddenly flipped the camera and acted like she was fixing her hair
