A student is here with their  family. They just came up to me and said ‘Hey Ms Penguin! Hey look mom, it’s Ms Penguin’ Said hi, conversed for a moment, kid and parent left to sit down, I went back to my embroidery. 

The kid’s mom came back and said “I just think it’s really inappropriate for a teacher to be seen drinking by the public, think about the message that sends” 

I’m just trying to unwind and privately do a craft here....

I’ve officially reached my breaking point. The entitlement and zero accountability have gone full nuclear. These parents aren’t raising kids, they’re raising excuses. 

We blame the students, but nope. The apples don’t fall far. The parents are the rotten tree. I’m done pretending otherwise. It's the parents fault for failing their kids, not ours. They failed and continue to do so by being terrible parents. It's not our job to handle their responsibilities.",1,1769835603.0,Teachers,0,1.0,False

1qrt565,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1qrt565/im_the_reason_my_fiancé_is_still_in_a_coma/,I’m the reason my fiancé is still in a coma,"From the outside looking in most people would think that Trent and I have a perfect relationship, almost a fairytale. It started out that way anyway. A better word for it would be Shakespearean because it’s transformed into a tragedy. Instead of waking up every morning to a text message, it’s the sound of a heart monitor. 

“Chloe, I've done told you that you don’t have to sleep here. That recliner has got to be mighty uncomfortable.” It’s Trent’s dad, Richard; and he’s brought me Starbucks. “it’s fine, I really don’t mind. If I was at home all I would do is stay awake and worry.” 

“I suppose I shouldn’t complain too much. Seems like when you are here that you provide a calming presence,” Rich stated as he checked the charts. Nothing had changed. Same as the day before. Same as the past three months. 

“I hope so,” I replied as I reached over and squeezed Trent’s hand. 

Richard sits opposite of me and gets on his phone to do some day trading and I get up to go pee. The hospital recliner is actually super inconvenient but I don’t have much choice. Splashing cold water on my face, I brushed my teeth and told myself that I could make it through the day just like I’d been doing for the past few months. 

Whatever it takes, I told myself. 

I leave shortly after our morning coffee and meet Macy on my way to work.

“Is this enough for next week?” she asks me as she shows the goods. Six injections. One that is stronger than the rest in case I need to take a day off. “How much do I owe you?” But she insisted that there was no fee this time. I smile faintly as I look at the bruises around her neck. She knows what I’m up against. 

I spend the next eight hours at my job, occasionally checking my phone for any alerts from the hospital. Anyone who saw it would assume I’m just being hopeful. Truth is, I’m paranoid.

“Chloe, can you work a double for me today? Kids sick and I don’t have a babysitter,” my coworker begs me. I could really use the money so despite how tired I am, I say that I can do it. Checking the schedule I estimated that would put me back at the hospital around 11 that night. 

It was risky, but I had already told them yes by the time I realized how late it would be. 

That afternoon extra shift is hell. There’s weather forecast for a severe ice storm and everybody and their brother comes to the store to stock up. I don’t even have time for a smoke break. 

After clocking out, the storm has already settled over our town and I have to run to my cry as a wintry mix covers the parking lot. Traffic is terrible. I kept checking the time to make sure I wasn’t late. I had only half an hour to get to the hospital before there’s any danger, I told myself. I’m trying not to panic but traffic is at a near standstill. 

It’s well past 1am when I make it there and I’m running to make it to Trent’s room. The familiar sound of the monitors has me relax at first. 

Then I realized that I forgot the injection in the car. The sleet is coming down hard now and by the time I got back to the parking lot it was solid ice. I tried to cross only to wind up feeling my butt hit the pavement so I had no choice but to wait for the storm to let up. 

Trent would likely go the night without his injection. 

I texted Macy frantically asking what I should do as I returned to the room. I was midway into the room when I realized I didn’t hear the monitors. 

Next thing I knew I felt Trent’s fingers against my throat as he throttled me to the wall.

I dropped my phone in shock as he pinned me there, his eyes filled with rage and blacker than the night sky. It all happens so fast that I don’t have much time to react as he begins to choke me. 

“Trent!! Trent you have to stop!!” I yelled. 

I’m hoping I can get through to him but it’s simply a mindless rage. He screams and begins to squeeze harder as my phone rings loudly. Macy is trying to get a hold of me. It’s enough of a distraction that I can push him back. Then I ran over to the hospital bed. 

“Trent!! Please stop this!!!” I shake the bed where my real fiancé is, his still form only looking even more like a shell as I feel the firm hand of the other Trent grab me and slam me down on the ground. 

Then a nurse walks in. 

I see the confusion on her face when she notices there are two men that look identical, one in a coma and one about to choke me to death. But it doesn’t take her long to react and she grabs the food tray and bashes it over the other Trent’s head. I kick and scream and scratch, pushing his dark side toward the window. It’s a sliding glass door and I use the ice that has accumulated right outside to my advantage, forcing him to slip backward and slam his head.

Disoriented, I rush to the chart the nurse brought in and find something strong enough to act as a sedative. 

I plunged it into my Trent’s neck and then watched as his shadow evaporated before my eyes. 

The next morning Macy arrives with another round of the injections and sees where I was attacked by Trent’s shadow self. “One day he will wake up, you know. Which version do you think you’ll get?” 

I apply skincare to my bruises. “Let’s hope that day never comes.” ",1,1769835575.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

Chapter 0001 – The Call

“We’ve finally found you, Young Master,” A breathless, excited voice said from the other end of the line.

 

Declan’s pupils widened for just a second and his breath caught in his throat.

 

Then reality kicked in.

 

“Another scammer,” he muttered to himself as he ended the call.

 

Slipping his phone back into his Walmart uniform pocket, he looked down at the gift box in his hand.

 

A smile spread across his face.

 

Today was Valentine’s day. Laura had been so sweet about it too. She’d told him not to worry about taking her out – she knew that he was occupied with handling both his academics and part-time work, so she didn’t want to add his load.

 

But how could he not worry? He wanted to surprise her. Three months ago, she’d told him she wanted a Dior bag and a Lululemon two piece set while they were window shipping downtown.

 

The price tag had made his stomach drop – two thousand, eight hundred dollars on a ten dollar an hour wage. But he’d worked every shift he could get for months, skipped meals, scraped together every cent just to see her smile when she opened this box.

 

Laura deserved it. She never complained when he couldn’t afford to take her out on dates. She was patient and understanding

 

That’s why he wanted to do this for her.

 

Declan’s heart pounded with excitement as he stood outside her apartment door.

 

He could already picture the excitement on her face when she opened up this box.

 

The way her eyes would light up and she’d throw her arms around him and tell him that he didn’t have to do this but he wanted to.

 

He took a deep breath and pushed open the door.

 

And his smile faded instantly.

 

There on the living room couch, tangled together, were Laura and his younger brother, Carlos.

 

Carlos’ hands were all over her, gripping her waist, sliding up her thighs.

 

Her dress was halfway up, showing skin Declan thought only he had seen.

 

They were kissing desperately like they couldn’t get enough of each other.

 

The gift box fell from his hands and crashed to the floor.

 

Laura turned to him, shocked. Her lipstick was smeared and her hair was a mess. “Declan, what are you doing here?” she gasped as she pushed Carlos away from her. “I thought you said you had a night shift?”

 

Declan’s throat burned. For a couple of seconds, he couldn’t get any words out.

 

The air felt too thick.

 

“I took the night off secretly, wishing to give you a surprise.” His voice came out bitter and raw.

 

“I spent nearly three months’ worth of savings on this bag for you.” He pointed at the box on the floor. “I’ve been helping you with your rent all this time. And this is how you repay me?”

 

Being questioned made her fly into a rage out of humiliation. She stood up from the couch, adjusting her dress, her eyes blazing. “You entered my home without permission! You violated my privacy! What kind of payback did you expect?”

 

Declan stared at her in disbelief. “You’re cheating on me with my brother and you’re talking about privacy?”

 

She let out a cold harsh laugh, shaking her head, “You guys are from the same family anyway. Does it make any difference who I sleep with? How is it even cheating?”

 

Each word hit like a knife to his chest. His teeth ground together and he stepped forward, his body tensing, ready to lunge. He couldn’t breathe or even think straight.

 

Carlos sat up on the couch with a smirk plastered on his face like he’d just won something, “Why are you overreacting?” he said casually. “So what if I stole your girl?”

 

He leaned back against the couch again, completely relaxed like all this was some sort of joke to him.

 

“Don’t forget u were adopted into our family. Everything you have rightfully belongs to me, the real young master. You’re just an ordinary orphan.”

 

“I’m not an orphan,” Declan shot back. He clenched his fists so hard his nails dug into his palms.

 

“Wake up, Declan,” Carlos said in a contemptuous tone. He stood up slowly and straightened his shirt, “You were nothing but a contingency plan. Mom and Dad thought they couldn’t have kids, so they got you from some adoption agency. You know, as a backup. But then medical advances came along and boom, they had me. Their real son. Naturally, you got tossed aside.”

 

Declan had always known he was adopted. His parents never hid it from him. But the way Derek said it, the way he threw it in his face like he was a worthless little thing made his blood boil.

 

Carlos walked over to the table and grabbed a bag, a brand new Hermès bag with the tags still on it.

 

He waved it in front of Declan’s face, “With all the family resources at my disposal, I can easily get things you couldn’t afford even after saving for a year. Hell, I could buy ten of these without blinking. So of course she chose me. Who wouldn’t?”

 

Laura stepped forward, her heels clicking. She grabbed Carlos by the collar and kissed him hard. Then she pulled back, breathless, and pressed the Hermès bag against her chest.

 

“This is what a real man gets me,” she purred, trailing her fingers down Carlos’s jaw. “Not cheap garbage I have to pretend to like.”

 

She bent down and picked the box Declan had dropped, “Leave the bag and go,” she said flatly, like she was dismissing a delivery guy.

 

“You don’t deserve it,” He said through gritted teeth.

 

Carlos’s face twisted with rage. “How dare you speak to her that way!” He lunged at Declan, his fist flying toward his face.

 

Declan didn’t have time to think. Carlos lunged at him, swinging wild and clumsy. Declan caught his wrist easily – years of hauling heavy stock had made his grip iron.

 

He twisted and threw a punch that connected hard with Carlos’ jaw. Carlos went down like a sack of bricks, crashing into the coffee table. The glass shattered and he hit the floor, groaning as blood trickled from his split lip.

 

Laura screamed something but he didn’t hear it. His ears were ringing. His vision was blurred with rage and pain and betrayal.

 

Without waiting to see if Carlos got back up, Declan turned and stormed out of the apartment, slamming the door behind him so hard the walls shook.

 

The cold night air stung. He stumbled onto the street with shaky legs and trembling hands.

 

For a moment, he just stood there under a flickering streetlight.

 

His fists were clenched so tight that his nails drew blood from his palms.

 

His chest heaved as he took sharp breaths.

 

One day, he thought, he’d have the power to get back at everyone who’d wronged him.

 

Everyone who’d looked down on him, stepped on him, treated him like he was nothing.

 

Laura. Carlos. His adoptive parents who’d always favored Carlos over him and never failed to remind him of his position in the family.

 

Every single one of them. He would make sure they’d regret it.

 

Just then, his phone buzzed in his pocket.

 

He pulled it out, expecting to see another spam call. But what he saw on the screen made his heart stop.

 

\*\*$100,000,000 deposited into account ending in 4829.\*\*

 

\*\*Balance: $100,000,247.83\*\*

 

He blinked and rubbed his eyes rapidly. Was this a dream?

 

He looked again but the numbers remained the same.

 

“What the hell…” He whispered, counting the zeros one by one. One hundred million dollars in his account. His hands started shaking worse than before.

 

His phone rang. It was the same unknown number from earlier.

 

His hand trembled as he answered. “Hello?”

 

“Young master, please don’t hang up,” the voice said urgently. “I know you think I’m a scammer. That’s why I just wired one hundred million dollars to your account. Check it. It’s real. I can wait while you verify it with your bank if you need to.”

 

Declan’s mouth went dry.

 

He stared at the notification again, his heart pounding so hard he could hear it in his ears. This couldn’t be real.

 

It had to be some kind of mistake. But he could see the numbers right there, glowing on his screen.

 

“Who… who are you?” He managed to say, his voice barely above a whisper.

 

“My name is Franklin. I’m the head butler of the Steele Family. And you, young master, are the heir we’ve been searching for.”

 

The Steele Family.

 

His mind reeled. That name echoed through his head.

 

The Steele Family was one of the top oligarch families in the country.

 

Everyone knew their name. They controlled industries, influenced politics, and owned half the city’s real estate.

 

They were the kind of people you only saw on the news or in Forbes magazine.

 

The real untouchables.

 

And this man was saying he was their heir?

 

“That’s impossible,” Declan said, his voice shaking.

 

“It’s not impossible, young master,” Franklin said gently. “It’s the truth. You are the young master of the Steele Family. And we’ve finally found you.”",1,1769835553.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

“I spent nearly three months’ worth of savings on this bag for you.” He pointed at the box on the floor. “I’ve been helping you with your rent all this time. And this is how you repay me?”

 

Being questioned made her fly into a rage out of humiliation. She stood up from the couch, adjusting her dress, her eyes blazing. “You entered my home without permission! You violated my privacy! What kind of payback did you expect?”

 

Declan stared at her in disbelief. “You’re cheating on me with my brother and you’re talking about privacy?”

 

She let out a cold harsh laugh, shaking her head, “You guys are from the same family anyway. Does it make any difference who I sleep with? How is it even cheating?”

 

Each word hit like a knife to his chest. His teeth ground together and he stepped forward, his body tensing, ready to lunge. He couldn’t breathe or even think straight.

 

Carlos sat up on the couch with a smirk plastered on his face like he’d just won something, “Why are you overreacting?” he said casually. “So what if I stole your girl?”

 

He leaned back against the couch again, completely relaxed like all this was some sort of joke to him.

 

“Don’t forget u were adopted into our family. Everything you have rightfully belongs to me, the real young master. You’re just an ordinary orphan.”

 

“I’m not an orphan,” Declan shot back. He clenched his fists so hard his nails dug into his palms.

 

“Wake up, Declan,” Carlos said in a contemptuous tone. He stood up slowly and straightened his shirt, “You were nothing but a contingency plan. Mom and Dad thought they couldn’t have kids, so they got you from some adoption agency. You know, as a backup. But then medical advances came along and boom, they had me. Their real son. Naturally, you got tossed aside.”

 

Declan had always known he was adopted. His parents never hid it from him. But the way Derek said it, the way he threw it in his face like he was a worthless little thing made his blood boil.

 

Carlos walked over to the table and grabbed a bag, a brand new Hermès bag with the tags still on it.

 

He waved it in front of Declan’s face, “With all the family resources at my disposal, I can easily get things you couldn’t afford even after saving for a year. Hell, I could buy ten of these without blinking. So of course she chose me. Who wouldn’t?”

 

Laura stepped forward, her heels clicking. She grabbed Carlos by the collar and kissed him hard. Then she pulled back, breathless, and pressed the Hermès bag against her chest.

 

“This is what a real man gets me,” she purred, trailing her fingers down Carlos’s jaw. “Not cheap garbage I have to pretend to like.”

 

She bent down and picked the box Declan had dropped, “Leave the bag and go,” she said flatly, like she was dismissing a delivery guy.

 

“You don’t deserve it,” He said through gritted teeth.

 

Carlos’s face twisted with rage. “How dare you speak to her that way!” He lunged at Declan, his fist flying toward his face.

 

Declan didn’t have time to think. Carlos lunged at him, swinging wild and clumsy. Declan caught his wrist easily – years of hauling heavy stock had made his grip iron.

 

He twisted and threw a punch that connected hard with Carlos’ jaw. Carlos went down like a sack of bricks, crashing into the coffee table. The glass shattered and he hit the floor, groaning as blood trickled from his split lip.

 

Laura screamed something but he didn’t hear it. His ears were ringing. His vision was blurred with rage and pain and betrayal.

 

Without waiting to see if Carlos got back up, Declan turned and stormed out of the apartment, slamming the door behind him so hard the walls shook.

 

The cold night air stung. He stumbled onto the street with shaky legs and trembling hands.

 

For a moment, he just stood there under a flickering streetlight.

 

His fists were clenched so tight that his nails drew blood from his palms.

 

His chest heaved as he took sharp breaths.

 

One day, he thought, he’d have the power to get back at everyone who’d wronged him.

 

Everyone who’d looked down on him, stepped on him, treated him like he was nothing.

 

Laura. Carlos. His adoptive parents who’d always favored Carlos over him and never failed to remind him of his position in the family.

 

Every single one of them. He would make sure they’d regret it.

 

Just then, his phone buzzed in his pocket.

 

He pulled it out, expecting to see another spam call. But what he saw on the screen made his heart stop.

 

\*\*$100,000,000 deposited into account ending in 4829.\*\*

 

\*\*Balance: $100,000,247.83\*\*

 

He blinked and rubbed his eyes rapidly. Was this a dream?

 

He looked again but the numbers remained the same.

 

“What the hell…” He whispered, counting the zeros one by one. One hundred million dollars in his account. His hands started shaking worse than before.

 

His phone rang. It was the same unknown number from earlier.

 

His hand trembled as he answered. “Hello?”

 

“Young master, please don’t hang up,” the voice said urgently. “I know you think I’m a scammer. That’s why I just wired one hundred million dollars to your account. Check it. It’s real. I can wait while you verify it with your bank if you need to.”

 

Declan’s mouth went dry.

 

He stared at the notification again, his heart pounding so hard he could hear it in his ears. This couldn’t be real.

 

It had to be some kind of mistake. But he could see the numbers right there, glowing on his screen.

 

“Who… who are you?” He managed to say, his voice barely above a whisper.

 

“My name is Franklin. I’m the head butler of the Steele Family. And you, young master, are the heir we’ve been searching for.”

 

The Steele Family.

 

His mind reeled. That name echoed through his head.

 

The Steele Family was one of the top oligarch families in the country.

 

Everyone knew their name. They controlled industries, influenced politics, and owned half the city’s real estate.

 

They were the kind of people you only saw on the news or in Forbes magazine.

 

The real untouchables.

 

And this man was saying he was their heir?

 

“That’s impossible,” Declan said, his voice shaking.

 

“It’s not impossible, young master,” Franklin said gently. “It’s the truth. You are the young master of the Steele Family. And we’ve finally found you.”",1,1769835500.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

My younger sister and my best friend got involved in something illegal last year. I won’t say what, but it started as a “quick money” thing and turned into a situation they couldn’t get out of. That situation came with a man attached to it. I’ll call him R (early 30sM).

R is the kind of person who doesn’t have to raise his voice. The room just bends around him. The first time I met him, my sister was shaking so bad she could barely hold a glass of water. My best friend wouldn’t look at him. He looked at them, then at me, and said, “You’re the one who actually thinks, huh?”

It wasn’t a compliment. It was an assignment.

From that point on, whenever something went wrong, he didn’t call them. He called me. If they messed up a job, I fixed it. If they panicked, I talked them down. Somewhere along the line I stopped being an outsider and started being part of the structure holding this whole mess together.

And he knows it.

The problem is… he treats me differently than he treats them. He’s patient with me. He explains things. He listens when I push back. I’ve seen him terrify grown men, but with me he’s calm, almost amused, like he’s watching a game unfold and I’m his favorite piece on the board.

I keep telling myself it’s manipulation. It has to be. There’s no world where a man like him sees me as anything but useful.

So why does it feel personal?

Two weeks ago my sister tried to back out. She broke down crying and said she couldn’t do it anymore. My best friend agreed. They wanted out, and they wanted me to tell him.

I went alone.

I expected anger. I expected threats. Instead he just looked at me for a long time and said, “You’re not scared of me. That’s rare.”

And I realized in that moment I wasn’t.

That scared me more than anything.

He told me he’d let them step back — but only if I stayed involved. Just me. I said yes before I even thought about it. I told myself I was protecting them. That I was taking the weight so they didn’t have to.

But the truth is uglier than that.

Part of me didn’t want to walk away.

My sister thinks I saved her. My best friend hugs me like I’m a hero. They don’t know I traded myself into the position they escaped. They don’t know I feel more alive in that dangerous orbit than I ever did in my normal life.

And now R calls me directly. Not for emergencies. Not just for business. Sometimes just to talk. He asks what I’m doing. What I’m thinking. He remembers small details about me that nobody else notices. When I told him I hadn’t slept, he showed up with coffee and said, “You’re no good to me exhausted.”

I should hate that sentence. Instead it’s been stuck in my head for days.

I don’t know if I’m being groomed into something worse or if I’m willingly stepping into it because I like the way he sees me. I’ve started lying to my sister about where I am. My best friend says I seem distant. They’re healing and I’m sinking deeper.

And the sickest part is I don’t know if I want to be pulled out.

I feel loyal to him in a way I can’t explain without sounding brainwashed. He hasn’t touched me. He hasn’t crossed a line. But the tension sits there, unspoken, like we’re both aware of it and choosing not to name it.

I keep thinking: if he asked me to leave all of this behind and walk away, I would.

I just don’t know if I’d want him to.

Has anyone ever chosen the thing that’s clearly ruining them because it feels like the first time they’ve ever been understood?

Chapter 1 

Evelyn’s POV 

Every time my husband wants to make me give in, he slaps divorce papers on the table. Every time my parents want me to cave, they 

threaten to disown me. 

What they want is simple: give everything to my twin sister. 

I used to fight back. I cried. I demanded to know why it always had to be me. 

But when the doctor slides the test results across his desk and tells me in that pitying voice, “Stage four brain cancer. You have a month, 

maybe less,” something in me just… stops caring. 

I’m dying anyway. They can do whatever the hell they want. 

I’m standing outside the hospital, and my phone starts ringing. 

Marcus. 

I answer. “Where are you?” His voice is already annoyed. “Get home. Kaley passed out again. Doctor says we need to schedule surgery ASAP. You’re signing that kidney donor consent today. Got it?” 

Before I can say anything, he keeps going. ‘Don’t pull any of your shit this time. You drag this out any longer, I’m having my lawyer file.

Your choice. 

98 

He hangs up. 

I’m staring at the black screen, my mind blank. This isn’t the first time Marcus has threatened divorce. Last month it was because Kaley wanted my necklace. The month before, she wanted to move into the master bedroom. 

As for the kidney thing, they’ve been tag-teaming me for six months now, ever since Kaley got hospitalized. 

Dad called yelling: “You feel good about being the older sister, huh? She’s been weak her whole life because you took everything from her before you were even born! She’s dying now, and you can’t give her one kidney?” 

Mom was worse, sobbing: “If you don’t save her, you’re not part of this family anymore. We didn’t raise you just to watch your sister die!” 

Marcus was the most direct: “If you really loved me, you wouldn’t put me in this position. You’re the only match for Kaley. You don’t sign, 

you’re making me choose between you two.” 

I said no back then. 

Dad stormed out. Mom pointed in my face and called me a ‘cold-blooded monster. Marcus threw the divorce papers at me. 

But now? None of it matters. 

I’m sitting in my car, watching the gray sky outside, and for the first time, I feel this weird sense of relief. 

I’ve got a month left. She can have the kidney. Not like I’ll need it. 

By the time I pull into the driveway, it’s already evening. 

I haven’t even opened the front door when I hear laughter coming from the living room. 

I walk in. My parents are sitting on either side of the sofa. Marcus is in the middle. Kaley’s curled up against him. There’s a plate of cut 

fruit on the coffee table. Dad’s telling some joke. Marcus is looking down at Kaley with this soft expression on his face. 

Kaley’s wearing a cream-colored cashmere dress, her cheeks flushed, eyes bright with laughter. 

Doesn’t look like someone who needs a new kidney. 

The door clicks shut behind me. Marcus looks up. The second he sees me, his face hardens. 

He stands, pulls two documents out of the coffee table drawer, and tosses them at my feet. 

“Kidney consent form. Divorce papers. His tone is flat, like he’s dealing with paperwork at the office. “Pick one. Today.” 

9:43 Sat, Jan 31 

Divorce Papers or Death Certificate 

My parents stop talking and turn to stare at me. 

: 

Mom frowns. “Why are you getting home so late? Kaley had a fever this afternoon. You know how scared we were?” 

Dad scoffs. “Always running around. You could spend that time worrying about your sister instead.” 

I bend down and pick up the documents. 

98 

The surgery date on the consent form is already filled in. Seven days from now. The divorce papers have a law firm’s letterhead at the top. 

Marcus has been ready for this. 

I’m standing there, looking at the four of them. 

Kaley bites her lip. “Evelyn, don’t feel bad… I know you don’t want to donate. It’s okay. I’ll figure something out…” 

“Figure out what?” Marcus cuts her off, glaring at me. “You’re her only match. Where’s she supposed to go?” 

Mom’s tearing up. “Exactly. How can you just watch her die?” 

I don’t say anything. I just stare at the consent form for a long time. 

Then I walk over to the coffee table, pick up a pen, and sign my name. 

The room goes dead silent for a second. Then everyone erupts. 

“Oh, thank God!” Mom’s wiping her eyes, rushing over to hug Kaley. “My baby girl is going to be okay!” 

Dad lets out this huge breath, claps Marcus on the shoulder. “Should’ve done this from the start. She’s the older sister. She’s supposed to 

look out for her little sister,” 

Marcus stares at me for a few seconds. His expression softens slightly, but there’s still no warmth. “Smart move.” 

Then he turns back to the sofa and keeps talking to Kaley. 

I drop my gaze. While they’re all distracted, I pick up the divorce papers, flip to the last page, and scribble my signature. 

Then I set them down in the corner of the coffee table. 

Nobody notices. 

The celebration goes on for about ten minutes. Mom even picks up her phone to order food delivery. “We should celebrate properly,” she 

says. 

When she puts her phone down, she suddenly seems to remember I exist. She turns to me. “Oh, and don’t worry too much. Once Kaley’s

Dad nods. ‘Right. You’ve got a stubborn streak, but you’re still our daughter.”

Marcus is leaning back on the sofa, throwing out casually, “Once she’s better, we’ll just live our lives. You should stop giving her such a 

hard time.” 

When he says this, Kaley’s tucked against him. Mom’s sitting next to Kaley pouring her water. Dad’s standing behind the sofa, smiling. 

The four of them form this perfect little circle. Like a family. 

And I’m standing on the other side of the coffee table, watching from the outside. 

I look at them and I almost want to laugh.

A detailed analysis (I guess),"I have seen a lot of posts here stating that christianity is a cult, so I wanted to fact-check if this was true using tools proposed by experts.

For the record, I don't consider myself an atheist, nor a christian... let's say I just don't know what to believe. I was raised in a christian household though, and I also assist a catholic college, so all the claims about christianity being a cult made me curious and I thought this community may like this analysis.

And since many of  you used to be christians and have some insight in history or just personal experiences, I thought maybe you could help me add more information into this analysis.

I'll be using various tools so expect this post to be long.

I'll be talking mainly about catholicism because this is the one in which I was raised.

# BITE's Tought Control and Lifton's Sacred Science, Doctrine Over Person Criteria

Since these 3 kinda overlap, I'll analyze them as one. The BITE model mentions various criteria for behaviour control:

>Adopting the group's map of reality as true and Lifton's 5th and 7th criteria

Okay this one is extremely obvious, specially within the catholic church, which puts a lot of emphasis on respecting dogma and doctrine, which is infallible btw, and has not changed nor will ever change (e.g. the whole creed, the immaculate conception, marriage exists only between a man and a woman).

If you didn't know, ecumenical councils within the catholic church, when talking about doctrine, faith or morals, are considered infallible as long as the council is summoned by the pope.

The pope is also infallible btw, but only when talking about very specific things and under special circumstances (*ex cathedra*).

Believers must adhere to these dogmas and doctrines; those who don't are considered sinners or heretics. Heretics are formally cut off from the church, whilst sinners can't recieve the Holy Communion until they repent. A noticeable phrase related to this topic is ***let them be anathema***, which I find very funny when mentioned in memes about orthodox christians vs catholic christians.

Whether the establishment of dogmas is good or bad is up to debate. Since dogmas help to form a shared identity and protects it.

I must say though, that some catholics are just way too orthodox, even for catholicism. For example, I saw a video of a guy saying that the Second Vatican Council destroyed the church and weakened its doctrines because it implied that there MIGHT be salvation outside the church... dude... you're mad about the possibility of more people being saved? ok?! 

>Instill black and white thinking, decide between good and evil, insiders vs outsiders perspective, labeling alternative systems as illegitimate, evil or not useful, labeling alternative belief systems as illegitimate 

This one is different depending on which group of christianity we're talking about, but it's ultimately true. Some christians consider other religions as ""having just a portion of the truth, which we fully have"", whilst others think that ""the rest of religions were inspired by demons"". This happens not only with different religions, but between different groups of christianity too.

>Loaded language (corresponds with Lifton's 6th criteria)

I honestly don't think that catholicism meets this criteria... Other christian groups might do it, but I am not familiar. Theologians do have a lot of special language such as transubstantiation, kenosis, theosis, atonement, etc., but that's used only by theologians, you don't come across your common catholic saying these things.

>Encourages only *good and proper* thoughts

Yeah, definitely yes. Mainly when we talk about sexual thoughts.

>Hypnotic techniques to alter mental states, undermine critical thinking and even age regression

Not in catholicism, I don't know about other christian groups.

>Memories are manipulated and false memories are created

Definitely not lol

>Thought stopping techniques, which include denial, rationalization, justification, wishful thinking, chanting, meditating, praying, speaking in tongues

Okay this is a big one. Catholics don't do this *speaking in tongues* thing, but some christians do. Praying and chanting are OBVIOUSLY very very common... I actually like the chants, there are various beautiful ones, I think catholicism has an amazing collection of music.

In general, I'm kinda skeptical 'bout this criteria cuz it's not that you end up losing your brain... and you can definitely still think while praying, that's why there are a lot of ""how not to get distracted during the rosary"" videos. And when you finish your prayer or your chant, you can think again. I know that the criteria refers to *critical thinking...* but if these practices stopped critical thinking then there wouldn't be deconversions. 

Regarding rationalization... this one's HUGE, specially when we talk about Hell. Christianity imo has been trying to justify Hell for CENTURIES. 

Actually, the idea of eternal suffering has been so crazy that there had been different heretical movements claiming interesting things about hell. For example, there are those who believe that whoever ends up in hell will suffer for just some time and then they'll be annihilated so that they suffer no more (annihilationism). Another group of this kind are those who believe that, eventually, all of humanity will be restored to friendship with God and nobody will have to suffer in hell (universalism).

>Rejection of ratinonal analysis, critical thinking, constructive criticism

I think this one doesn't apply to catholicism... Constructive criticism is actually very encouraged (or at least that's what I've seen from my experience).

>Forbid critical questions about leader, doctrine or pollicy

You can actually question about dogma, people will explain the reasoning behind it.

# BITE's Emotional control

This one also has various points.

>Some emotions/needs are deemed as wrong or selfish

All emotions are valid within christianity, it's their extrapolation what makes them bad (e. g. anger vs wrath)... Seems reasonable to me.

>Teach emotion-stopping techniques to block feelings of homesickness, anger, doubt

I don't think christianity has any of these... at least not catholicism imo.

>One person's problems are always their own fault, never the leader's nor the group's fault

Ehm... I also don't think catholicism has any of these. Yes you're responsible for your sins, but if the church does something wrong, catholics are encouraged to denounce it.

>Promote feelings of guilt or unworthiness 

Now this is something that catholicism does have. Things like ""I'm a sinner, I'm unworthy of God's love or forgiveness, I deserve Hell"".

>Instill fear

Uhm... well... Hell... lol. Even without considering Hell... Fear of being disowned, specially for homosexual or trans people.  

I have seen christians defend the fear of hell by saying that it's something similar to scaring your child by saying ""if you put your hands near the stove, you will burn and it'll hurt"" in order to prevent him from putting his hands near the stove. So yeah, it's seen as *protecting someone*. 

I actually saw a post here on reddit about and hindu saying that it'd be a good idea to convert to christianism in order to avoid hell. His reasoning was as follows: ""if hinduism is true, we just reincarnate in whatever our karma sets us, if christianity is true and we don't practice it, we're doomed to eternal despair"".

Furthermore, within catholicism there's a statement, considered dogmatic, that says: *Extra ecclesia nulla sallus* (outside of the \[catholic\] church, there is no salvation). So yeah, even if you decide to leave the catholic church and join idk an orthodox church, you're still doomed kiddo.

I'm gonna cite the Catechism of the Catholic Church for y'all:

*CCC 846 (fragment): Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it.*

This one clearly checks **Lifton's 8th criteria: Dispensing of Existence**

>Extremes of emotional highs and lows

Nah, not really

>Ritualistic and often public confession of sins, Lifton's 4th criteria

In catholicism, confession of sins is never public, priests are bound by the seal of confession so they can't say what you've confessed and a lot of times (depends on the confessionary) you never even know who the confessor is. Confessions are indeed ritualistic, but they don't ask you a lot of detail, just to be honest and repent. As someone who has confessed various times... It feels very relieving.

>Phobia indoctrination: inculcating irrational fears about leaving the group or questioning the leader's authority, dispensation from existence (Lifton's 8th criteria)

I mean, you can leave catholicism any day you want, just stop going to church, stop confessing, stop going to adoration... What remains is the fear of going to hell.

What does exist is this idea that those who leave only do so because they want to indulge in sin, don't want to grow in virtue and stuff like that.

And... This is kinda true (???). Some people don't want to be told what to do with their sexuality or orientation... heck, even heterosexuals are bound by some rules. People don't want to be told who they can marry, etc. This chekcs **Lifton's 3rd criteria: the demand for purity**.

And this exact same argument could be used by other religions (well, at least the abrahamic ones). EXAMPLES.

* A jewish man says to his son ""you only want to convert to christianity because you don't want to follow the mosaic law""
* A muslim mad says to his son ""you only want to convert to christianity because you don't want to follow the sharia law""
* A mormon father says to his son ""you only want to convert to catholicism because you want to drink coffee, lots of beer and have tattoos (fyi catholicism doesn't condemn tattoos nor piercings as long as they are not blasphemous or immoral)

These are silly examples, I know, but they are examples nonetheless

# BITE's Behaviour Control

These are gonna be a little bit more quick

**Regulate individual's physical reality.** Maybe this is shown mostly with trans people

**Dictate where, how and with whom the member lives and associates.** 

Not a catholic thing NOWADAYS, since catholics are not encouraged to cut ties with non-believers. Catholics are called to ""live in the world but don't be part of this world"". In spite of this, the catholic church does dictate how and when a person can associate romantically with another one (rules about chatity, cohabiting, etc). Furthermore, it used to be a thing (not anymore) that a catholic could only marry another catholic. 

[Here's a little bit of history directly from a catholic friar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLXeoQybXEU), just ten minutes

**When, how and with whom the member has sex.** Pretty obvious one, an undeniable yes.

**Control types of clothing and hairstyles.** 

Not a catholic thing, you can dress with any style you want as long as you dress modestly... Yeah maybe that's some type of control right there, but at least catholics don't stone people for dressing gothic or punk.

**Regulate diet, food and drink, hunger and/or fasting.** 

Meatless fridays used to be a thing within catholicism, but they are not obligatory anymore. Fasting is optional and must never ever damage the believer's health. As far as I remember, there are only a few days in which fasting is obligatory and it's just ""don't eat red meat"" lol. I don't se e an issue. Other christian groups may ban alcohol consuption... I don't think it's that big of a deal... I mean, it's better to live without alcohol lol. 

**Deprivation of sleep.** 

Nop... I mean, you have midnight masses like once a year and most of the time there's another mass wich takes place earlier, you can assist to that one if you want.

**Financial explotation.** 

Nop, in catholicism, tithing is voluntary, the amount is also up to you. 

**Restrict leisure, entertainment, vacation time.** I think this is the protestant's fault...

**Major time spent with group endoctrination.** 

I'm not very sure about this one... Catholicism has bible studies and catechism and the catechumenate (RCIA nowadays) but they don't last forever... Bible studies are optional too. It's just catholics who personally decide to follow priests/theologians/apologists on youtube, but they are not *required* to.

In addition to this, even though it is not required by the church, many parents choose to send their children to christian schools or even end up homeschooling them (although I think this just happens in the US, I haven't seen it in my country)

**Permission required for major decisions.** I don't think so, nop

**Rewards and punishments used to modify behaviours.** 

Excommunion is literally intended to be used this way, it ultimately seeks to make the excommunicated person repent of their sins

**Discourage individualism, encourage group-thinking.** Kinda? Idk how to evaluate this.

**Impose rigid rules and regulations.** 

Kinda, I think most of catholicism rules are not that hard to follow, even all of those pertaining chatsity are attainable imo.

**Punish disobedience by beating, torture, burning, cutting, rape or tattooing**. 

Well... The inquisition existed... maybe they killed a lot less people than what it is claimed... but they still killed people.

**Threaten harm to family and friends.** Currently, no

**Force individuals to rape or to be raped.** NO, DEFINITELY NO

**Encourage and engage in corporal punishment.** 

This one is interesting because nowadays not a single catholic is hitting his back with a chain or at least a rope... But it used to be done so... (btw, a famous catholic known by this practice is [St. John Vianney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vianney))

Let's also remember that christianity praises martyrdom highly. A very clear example of this is [St. Ji Tianxiang](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Ji_Tianxiang).

This was actually the reason why the japanese ended up deciding that killing christians was not precisely a very good idea if they wanted to end christian presence in Japan, because martyrs proved their conviction and faith, thus encouraging others to preserve their faith.

Eventually, the japanese decided that the best way to fight christianity was to [force christians to step on images of Jesus or the Virgin Mary ](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumie)in order to show disrespect towards them.

**Instill dependance and obedience.** 

According to catholic theology, there are ordinary means of salvation in which the believer must participate in order to be saved. It turns out that just the ones performed by the catholic church are valid (except baptism). This sounds like dependance to me. And yeah the obedience part has been already covered.

I'll add an example of these *means of salvation* for those who are unfamiliar with it. In order to be forgiven of your sins, you must repent and confess your sins to a catholic priest, not an anglican, not a lutheran, just a catholic priest. If you don't, your sins are not forgiven and you will end up in hell if you suddenly die for whatever reason (there are actually more nuances and there's actually still hope for salvation, but that would be to step into theology and stuff).

**Kidnapping.** NO

**Beating, torture, imprisonment, murder.** Not anymore

# BITE's Information Control and Milieu Control (Lifton's 1st criteria)

This one is the reason why I decided to make this whole analysis, specifically this next criteria:

>Deception, deliberately withholding information, distort information to make it more acceptable, systematically lie to the cult member, minimize or discourage access to non-cult sources of information, compartmentalize information into outsider vs insider doctrines

This one is big and I only need to redirect you to:

* [Britannica Index Librorum Prohibitorum](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum)
* [Wikipedia Index Librorum Prohibitorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum)
* [EBSCO Index Librorum Prohibitorum](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/religion-and-philosophy/index-librorum-prohibitorum)

For those who don't want to open the links, it's basically a curated list of forbidden books. No catholic should read, copy or spread these books, or else they'd be commiting mortal sin and may even be excommunicated.

>Encourage spying on other members

Within catholicism, totally, yes. It doesn't happen anymore, but inquisitors used to encourage believers to denounce any heretical they knew of. Furthermore, it was clearly stated that anyone who knew of a heretic person or group and voluntarily decided to remain silent about it was commiting grave sin and was at risk of being excommunicated.

[Wikipedia ""Edicto de fe"" ](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edicto_de_fe)  
(it's in spanish sorry, use a translator)

[UNAM's document about the Edictos de fe in Mexico](https://archivos.juridicas.unam.mx/www/bjv/libros/14/6851/2.pdf)  
(UNAM is an important mexican university... the document is also in spanish, sorry)

>Unethical use of confession such as: using information about sins to disrupt identity boundaries, withhold forgiveness or manipulate someone's memory

This did happen within the catholic church and it took the form of *solicitation* (a priest touching a believer in an improper way), but it was NEVER EVER allowed or fostered by the church and it was actually persecuted by the Inquisition.

Additionally, a priest can withhold forgiveness, but this almost never happens and it's only done when the believer shows no remorse of his sins and has a clear intention of commiting the same sin one more time so... it sounds fair to me.

# Finally, Lifton's 2nd criteria: Mystical Manipulation

Okay this one's really hard because I wholeheartedly think that even the pope, cardinals, bishops, etc. believe that the miracles in catholic history are true, or at least some of them. What I mean is, I don't think most miracles were carefully and intentionally planned in order to gain more believers.

I'm mexican, so this is very important to me since my country has been a catholic one for centuries mostly due to Our Lady of Guadalupe. The catholic church thinks that this apparition is legitimate, whilst some historians and even some catholic priests think that it's made up. 

The outcome is clear: millions of indigenous people *converted* to catholicism within a decade. And I say *converted* because there's a catch: some people believe that Our Lady of Guadalupe is syncretic with Coatlicue (an aztec goddess) or Tonantzin (a mexica goddess), and that indigenous people were just trying to keep practicing their beliefs in a discreet way, just like believers of Yoruba started to use statues of saints with the intention of being unnoticed by the church (this later became *Santería* btw).

I am very skeptic about this apparition tbh, and I think it is important to state that I believe that miracles can happen.

We also have an [eucharistic miracle that occurred in Tixtla, in 2006.](https://www.miracolieucaristici.org/en/liste/scheda_b.html?nat=messico&wh=tixtla&ct=Tixtla,%202006) This one is also interesting because it was analysed by someone with almost no known background in science, who had also *investigated* another two eucharistic miracles in Buenos Aires.

[Here's a link to a reddit post in r/DebateACatholic in which an agnostic questions the credibility of the miracle](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateACatholic/comments/1hv020d/dr_ricardo_casta%C3%B1%C3%B3n_g%C3%B3mez_is_a_quack_and_if_i/?tl=es-419)  
The same post also links ANOTHER post in which this same user questions the eucharistic miracles that happened in Buenos Aires. 

It is important to say that the catholic church is very zealous regarding miracles, especially apparitions. The church usually investigates and analyzes a miracle in order to discard any logical/scientific explanation. With apparitions it becomes even more interesting because the church only recognizes those which adhere to catholic teachings, doctrine and dogma. 

[Here's a secular video about Marian Apparitions and how sometimes the church disquialifies some of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ6oeCMZk_k) 

Lifton's 2nd criteria also includes the following

**Leaders claim to be chosen by God.** 

Well this is true, catholics believe that the Holy Spirit (who is trully and fully God according to catholic theology) guides the cardinals in choosing who becomes the next pope.

**The believer participates actively in the manipulation of others.** 

Also clearly very true, as many of you have experienced. Some christians are always trying to convert people, that's why some of them delve a lot in apologetics. 

I think this stems from the belief that catholicism/christianity is the only way to attain salvation, and people obviously love other people, so they want them to be saved, thus, they must convert them.

This one is kinda justifiable to some degree (??). Let me explain, I study medicine and I am all in for vaccines because they can prevent epidemics or stop pandemics (such as COVID-19), so I'll obviosly advocate for the usage of vaccines and try to convince anti-vaxxers that they should get vaccinated. See my point?

The problem is that... there's scientific evidence for vaccines, whilst evidence of the existence of hell or heaven is just the New Testament and visions that some saints had.  

# Closure

That's it, thank you guys for reading all of this. The conclusion about this is really obvious and straight-forward for you, but I still wanted to share my analysis. If any of you has more information regarding this topic, especially about history, I would love to read it.

I don't think this proves/disproves the authenticity of christianity and specially of catholicism, but at least it evidentiates how the church has lasted for so long even when there has been opposition for literally all its history. Catholics will say that the prevalence of the church in history clearly proves Mt 16:18 (*The gates of Hades will not prevail against it \[the church\]*) and Mt 28:20 (*I \[Jesus\] will be with you \[the church\] until the end of time*), but we all know that institutions are designed to last a very long time, specially the culty ones. Is this a prophecy coming true? Or is it just that christianity was, from its very beginning, designed to endure due to its cultic characteristics?  

Anyways, if God has to use cult tactics to make his church endure then... ehm... ehm... ehm...

1qrsyj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qrsyj5/i_think_i_accidentally_fell_for_the_man_whos/,I think I accidentally fell for the man who’s ruining my life and I don’t know how to stop,"I’m 19F and I’ve been sitting on this for months because saying it out loud makes me sound like a terrible person.

My younger sister and my best friend got involved in something illegal last year. I won’t say what, but it started as a “quick money” thing and turned into a situation they couldn’t get out of. That situation came with a man attached to it. I’ll call him R (early 30sM).

R is the kind of person who doesn’t have to raise his voice. The room just bends around him. The first time I met him, my sister was shaking so bad she could barely hold a glass of water. My best friend wouldn’t look at him. He looked at them, then at me, and said, “You’re the one who actually thinks, huh?”

It wasn’t a compliment. It was an assignment.

From that point on, whenever something went wrong, he didn’t call them. He called me. If they messed up a job, I fixed it. If they panicked, I talked them down. Somewhere along the line I stopped being an outsider and started being part of the structure holding this whole mess together.

And he knows it.

The problem is… he treats me differently than he treats them. He’s patient with me. He explains things. He listens when I push back. I’ve seen him terrify grown men, but with me he’s calm, almost amused, like he’s watching a game unfold and I’m his favorite piece on the board.

I keep telling myself it’s manipulation. It has to be. There’s no world where a man like him sees me as anything but useful.

So why does it feel personal?

Two weeks ago my sister tried to back out. She broke down crying and said she couldn’t do it anymore. My best friend agreed. They wanted out, and they wanted me to tell him.

I went alone.

I expected anger. I expected threats. Instead he just looked at me for a long time and said, “You’re not scared of me. That’s rare.”

And I realized in that moment I wasn’t.

That scared me more than anything.

He told me he’d let them step back — but only if I stayed involved. Just me. I said yes before I even thought about it. I told myself I was protecting them. That I was taking the weight so they didn’t have to.

But the truth is uglier than that.

Part of me didn’t want to walk away.

My sister thinks I saved her. My best friend hugs me like I’m a hero. They don’t know I traded myself into the position they escaped. They don’t know I feel more alive in that dangerous orbit than I ever did in my normal life.

And now R calls me directly. Not for emergencies. Not just for business. Sometimes just to talk. He asks what I’m doing. What I’m thinking. He remembers small details about me that nobody else notices. When I told him I hadn’t slept, he showed up with coffee and said, “You’re no good to me exhausted.”

I should hate that sentence. Instead it’s been stuck in my head for days.

I don’t know if I’m being groomed into something worse or if I’m willingly stepping into it because I like the way he sees me. I’ve started lying to my sister about where I am. My best friend says I seem distant. They’re healing and I’m sinking deeper.

And the sickest part is I don’t know if I want to be pulled out.

I feel loyal to him in a way I can’t explain without sounding brainwashed. He hasn’t touched me. He hasn’t crossed a line. But the tension sits there, unspoken, like we’re both aware of it and choosing not to name it.

I keep thinking: if he asked me to leave all of this behind and walk away, I would.

I just don’t know if I’d want him to.

Has anyone ever chosen the thing that’s clearly ruining them because it feels like the first time they’ve ever been understood?

I'm writing this 36 hours after my fistulotomy surgery, laying (carefully) with a glass of water next to me, feeling cautiously optimistic for the first time in over two months. If you're reading this in the middle of your own nightmare (maybe in a bathroom, maybe at 3 a.m., maybe both), I want you to know something important before we go any further:

**Your story will not be everyone else's story.**

That might sound obvious. But when you're deep in these Reddit threads at midnight, reading about complex branching tracts and months-long recoveries and third surgeries, your brain doesn't process probability. It processes possibility. And possibility, when you're scared and in pain, feels like certainty.

I read hundreds of posts here. They helped me feel less alone. They also convinced me, at various points, that I was facing the worst-case scenario. I wasn't. You probably aren't either.

# The Timeline Nobody Warns You About

It started in November with what I assumed was a hemorrhoid. Just discomfort while driving, then sudden, brutal escalation. By that night I was at Walgreens buying hemorrhoid cream. By the next morning I was in the ER, where I sat for five hours in the kind of pain that makes you understand why people in old novels ""saw stars.""

They performed an incision and drainage. I went home thinking it was over.

Two weeks later, almost to the day my antibiotics ran out, it came back. Another ER visit, another surgery, an overnight hospital stay, and this time they installed a Penrose drain: a small rubber tube connecting two incision sites, designed to keep things open and draining.

What followed was a month of limbo. Not crisis-level pain, but a constant 3-or-4-out-of-10 discomfort. The inability to sit normally. Holiday parties where I stood in corners or paced outside. The particular indignity of having gas escape through an opening that wasn't supposed to exist, and wincing visibly every single time.

Then came the confirmation: a fistula. A tunnel from inside the anal canal to the skin surface. The only real fix is surgery.

# The Loneliness Nobody Talks About

Here's what surprised me most: how isolating this experience is.

You have a family who loves you right outside the bathroom door. But they're not in there with you while you're cleaning up drainage, or trying not to scream, or (in my case) watching actual fecal matter exit through a hole in your buttock that shouldn't exist.

That was the worst moment. Not physically the most painful (though it was up there), but psychologically the most disturbing. You can't exactly text a friend about that. You can't bring it up at dinner. You carry it alone, and the weight of that silence compounds everything else.

This community helped with that loneliness. But the community also amplified my fears. Which brings me to what I actually want to share: the practical, non-obvious things that made this bearable.

# Tips You May Not Find in Discharge Papers

# On Gauze: Not All Gauze Is Created Equal

For six weeks, I used standard woven gauze. Then my wife ordered non-woven gauze (same brand, same manufacturer), and it was like switching from sandpaper to silk. The woven kind has texture that irritates raw skin. The non-woven kind feels almost buttery. This single change dramatically improved my daily comfort.

**The tip:** Look for ""non-woven"" gauze pads. It's a small label distinction with an outsized impact.

# On Mobility: The Electric Scooter Solution

Everyone asks about sitting. Can I drive? Can I bike? Both require you to sit, and sitting is the enemy.

You know what doesn't require sitting? Standing on an electric scooter.

I live in a city where rental scooters are everywhere. I started using them to get to work, to grab coffee, to feel human. You just stand there. The slight bouncing over sidewalk cracks actually felt good, almost like a gentle massage. Eventually I bought a used one for under $300.

The day after my surgery, against every piece of reasonable medical advice, I rode my scooter to my coffee shop. Less than 100 steps total, round trip. My family thought I was insane. My surgeon would probably agree. But psychologically, it reminded me that normal life was still out there waiting.

**I'm not recommending this.** I'm just telling you what I did, and why it mattered to me.

# On the Penrose Drain: Cut Your Gauze Strategically

If you have a Penrose drain, here's a technique nobody taught me: cut a slit in one side of your gauze pad, then cut a small circle in the center. This lets you wrap the gauze *around* the drain, keeping it completely covered and preventing skin irritation from drainage contact.

This was a game-changer for managing the awkwardness of the drain.

# On Bathroom Supplies: Double Up on Portable Bidets

Those squeeze-bottle portable bidets are essential. But one bottle often isn't enough water for a thorough clean after a bowel movement. Buy two. Fill both with warm water before you go. The extra capacity means you can actually get clean without excessive wiping.

I have an electronic bidet on my toilet, but post-surgery I preferred the bottle. It gave me more control over pressure, angle, and when to stop.

# On Sitz Baths: The Bathtub Might Be Better

Everyone recommends the plastic sitz bath that fits over your toilet. I bought two different models and hated both. They pinched my legs and felt cramped.

I ended up just using my actual bathtub. Warmer, more comfortable, room to shift positions. There are different opinions on this, but do what actually works for your body.

# On Wiping: Water Wipes Only

Baby wipes marketed as ""water wipes"" (no fragrance, no alcohol, no sanitizers) were essential. I went through hundreds of them. Your skin in that area will be raw and angry. Regular wipes or toilet paper will make it worse.

# On Bending: Get a Grabber Tool

My daughter has one of those toy robot-arm grabber sticks. I started using it constantly: picking up laundry, reaching things on the floor, even cleaning the bathtub with a washcloth attached. Bending at the waist is surprisingly painful throughout this process. A $10 grabber tool saved me countless moments of agony.

# On Self-Monitoring: Mirror, Flashlight, Delete

I used a standing  mirror and a flashlight to inspect the area and take photos documenting changes. Then I deleted the photos after reviewing them, keeping them only 30 days in my phone's trash for reference if needed.

This felt like mental hygiene. I didn't want a permanent archive of my worst moments. I didn't want someone scrolling through my phone to stumble onto them. And deleting them felt like closing a chapter, even temporarily.

# The Most Important Decision I Made: Getting the MRI

When my surgeon confirmed the fistula and scheduled surgery, he mentioned that an MRI wasn't  necessary. ""Nice to have, not need to have.""

I pushed for one anyway.

Here's what I learned: in Europe, MRI with fistula protocol is standard. In the U.S., it's often skipped. *But the number-one cause of fistula recurrence is incomplete treatment, meaning a branch or tract that wasn't visible during surgery gets missed.*

An MRI provides a detailed map. It cost me $1,200 out of pocket and delayed my surgery by two weeks. My fistula turned out to be simple: single tract, superficial, no muscle involvement. The MRI confirmed what my surgeon suspected.

But knowing that gave me peace. And if it had revealed something complex, it would have changed the surgical approach entirely.

**My advice:** If your insurance or finances allow it, push for the MRI. The information is worth it.

# A Word About AI, and Why I Used It More Than Online Groups

This might be controversial here, but: I found personalized AI conversations more helpful than Reddit threads or Facebook groups for managing my anxiety.

The challenge with online groups is that you're reading everyone's story. The simple cases, the nightmares, and everything in between. Your brain can't filter by probability. You see a post about a five-inch wound and a six-month recovery, and suddenly that's your future.

AI tools (I used Perplexity daily, but Claude gave me the most balanced, measured responses) let me describe my specific situation and get contextualized information. When I shared that my fistula appeared superficial and single-tract, the AI didn't push me to the extremes. It gave me a more realistic range of outcomes for someone in my position.

I also used it as a diary, logging symptoms, asking questions, preparing summaries for doctor visits. Before meeting my surgeon, I'd ask it to compile everything I'd reported over the previous two weeks into a concise briefing.

**This doesn't replace medical advice.** Of course you should always confirm with your doctor. Get second and third opinions. But for managing the mental load between appointments, AI was more stabilizing than doom-scrolling through worst-case scenarios.

# Where I Am Now

My surgery revealed exactly what the MRI predicted: a single, superficial tract, curving slightly (my surgeon described it as ""like a dogleg on a golf course""), but involving no sphincter muscle. A straightforward fistulotomy. He's confident he got everything.

My first bowel movement post-surgery, about 36 hours in, was a 1-or-2 out of 10 on the pain scale. I know that's not everyone's experience. I know I might have harder days ahead. But right now, I'm counting that as a blessing.

# The Takeaways

If you're early in this journey, here's what I'd want you to remember:

* **Non-woven gauze** is dramatically more comfortable than woven.
* **An electric scooter** lets you move around without sitting. Consider one!
* **Two portable bidets** are better than one.
* **A grabber tool** saves you from painful bending.
* **Water wipes only.** No fragrance, no alcohol.
* **Push for an MRI** if you can. The map matters.
* **Your bathtub** might work better than a sitz bath on the toilet.
* **Cut a hole in your gauze** to wrap around any drain.
* **Use AI for personalized guidance**, not just Reddit for horror stories.
* **Breathe through the pain.** Count slowly. It helps more than you'd think.

And most importantly:

*Your story is the only one that will happen to you.* Don't let the worst-case posts convince you they're your destiny. The range of outcomes is wide, and most people land somewhere in between.

I'm happy to answer questions as I continue recovering. If you're in the scared, confused, painful middle of this, you're not alone. It does get better.

Wishing you the best.

I don't exactly trust the government to go public with my findings, in fact, I wouldn't trust them further than I could spit, so I plan on publishing this online before I don't have a way to interact with the outside world *at all.*

I started to first notice them on a Sunday morning after working a grueling second shift the night before. The truth is I almost didn't notice them at first, and I'm willing to bet you wouldn't have noticed them either. Do you know those green boxes that you see in front of houses sometimes? Those poorly camouflaged man-made objects that are just ugly enough to warrant you to look at them when you check your mailbox? Yeah, I'm talking about those. *Pad-mounted transformers*. I saw an extra one when I was pouring my morning coffee a few weeks ago.

At first, I just figured I had never noticed it before. Kind of like the Mandela effect if you will. But something told me that it had *always* been there. And that definitely couldn't have been right.

I moved into the spot I live in now about two years ago. Per my dad's guidance, I made a note of absolutely *everything* there was to make note of just in case something happened and I needed a record of how the place was when I got here. As soon as I saw the extra green box, I checked my notes which had some pictures as well.

In *none* of the pictures were two of those green boxes. A chill ran down my spine as I tried to recount the times I had looked out of my kitchen window and seen two of them. I couldn't recall there ever *not* being two, and I got this gut feeling that I had to investigate further. In hindsight, I shouldn't have.

Looking around my study where I kept my notes, and any other important documents, I turned my attention to my laptop sitting on my desk. Opening it, I swiftly logged in and navigated to an extension I had installed a while ago and promptly forgotten about; WS4U. It was a scarily cheap camera system I had installed when I first moved in. WS4U standing for We See 4 U. Yeah, I know, classy. Opening the live feed, I started to rewind. At first, it was by an interval of 3 hours. I went back a week. And still, there were two of them.

*""There's no way,""* I muttered aloud.

I started rewinding quicker. By about 8-hour intervals now, I went back another week. After about 5 days, and 16 hours, the green box simply disappeared. Between frames, it just *vanished*. Now with a time frame of about 8 hours to work with I shortened the intervals I was using to rewind. I now started to comb through the 8-hour interval in 30-minute chunks. After rewinding 4 times, and combing through two hours, I was able to pinpoint the exact time the extra green box appeared. 9:27 pm.

""*Gotcha,""* I whispered aloud. Saving the clip, I uploaded it to my cloud to make sure I would be able to access it easily the next time I needed to. I then decided to investigate the actual box itself. Stepping out of my house, I pulled the hoodie I was wearing over my head. It was pretty cool out, but not so cold it would be unbearable for a few minutes. I started to walk down my driveway, cutting through the grass covered in morning dew to get to the green box. I could feel the moisture from the grass soaking through my thin bunny slippers, but I didn't care. I was determined to figure out what the green box actually was.

Approaching it, I bent down and examined it carefully. There were no identifying tags, labels, or anything similar on the green box. It didn't even have a warning label like the actual one beside it had, which made it all the more suspicious. Carefully reaching out, I placed a hand on the box, and quickly pulled it back. It was *hot.* So hot a second longer would've probably left a burn.

It was as I was trying to figure out how this thing was emitting so much heat that I realized it had a latch. And that latch was holding two nearly imperceptible door-like openings closed. Reaching out again, I very carefully hovered my hand above the latch, feeling the heat it released warm my palm.

It seemed like the entire thing was emitting heat. Every. Single. Inch.

Getting up now, I knew I had to see what was inside. Looking back I don't know why I was so determined. I wish I wasn't.

I returned to my home and going into the kitchen I grabbed what I thought I might need. Some oven mitts, tongs, a hammer, and some thick skewers. I also grabbed my phone and a water bottle, and mentally prepared myself to open up the box.

Now wielding the tools that I believed would help me get to the bottom of the situation, I approached the box yet again. I poured the water over the latch, watching as it sizzled upon contact and evaporated into steam. I had already poured out the entire water bottle when I realized it wasn't cooling down.

So I enacted plan B, just as any level-headed person would do. I used the hammer to forcibly break the latch off.

It came off after a few hard *thwacks*, and landed in the grass directly beneath it. I quickly moved my feet out of the way, not willing to underestimate whatever this box was, and as such, I treated every piece of it as an alien entity. Unsurprisingly, the grass underneath it started to smoke.

Turning my attention back to the box I saw that the two door-like pieces were now slightly ajar. I used the tongs to try and force them open, but I had to stop after I realized the entire area immediately surrounding the box felt like the desert.

Taking off my hoodie, I felt that my entire body was already slick with sweat. I adjusted my stance, coming around the green box to stand behind it, before I opened the doors outwards, allowing the heat to escape into the air. I could see the air in front of the box *rippling* as the heat energy dissipated.

I waited a few minutes like this, to be sure I wouldn't faint or get burned, and when I was sure enough heat had escaped, I donned the oven mitts and tongs and prepared to look inside.

Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw.

Inside was much, much more vast than anything I had ever seen before. It appeared to be a very dark room that seemed to stretch on for miles. The room was illuminated by small, red lights and Immediately below the small doors was a set of stairs, that seemed to be an optical illusion. They looked much too steep for anyone to walk down without holding on to something, and they were suspended in air by seemingly nothing.

As stupid as it sounds I stuck my head in and held my phone out in front of me recording. I almost thought it was a little hidden bunker-type thing until I saw *them* staring back at me.

Hundreds of them, if not fucking thousands. Small bat-like creatures that looked vaguely humanoid. Their eyes were *piercing* and I don't know how I didn't notice them immediately. They were almost the same color as the wall, and the ends of their *wings* seemed to have sharp talon-like projections. They seemed to turn their heads in unison when I peered in and were all actively looking at me. Even now when I close my eyes all I see is their gigantic eyes. For Christ's sake, their eyes were insanely disproportionately large when compared to the size of their tiny heads.

""*I- I'm sorry*,"" I stuttered. It was a feeble attempt at saving my own skin. Quickly I withdrew my head and phone, and I scrambled to close the doors back and latch the box shut.

The oven mitts nearly slipped out of my hands, and the latch was still warm when I picked it up, but I got it closed. And you bet your ass I booked it into my house.

I had barely caught my breath when I looked back outside through the kitchen window and saw that the fake green box was now a few feet closer.

I blinked.

Now it was a few inches closer.

Fumbling for my phone I tried to call 911. Even if they didn't believe me at least I wouldn't be alone in whatever was about to happen. But the call wouldn't go through.

I tried to text my family, coworkers, or anyone, but the texts all failed to be delivered. Those small red exclamation marks letting me know they didn't go through seemed to laugh at me, humiliate me.

As I look up now I can no longer see the green box, but I can feel its warmth behind me.

I'm hoping that this reaches someone, or something, and maybe you can be better prepared for whatever this is.

Just know that if your texts haven't been going through, *it might already be too late.* ",3,1769834411.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

It’s my first time playing FFXIV, and I already get a taste of how toxic the market can be...

Pyrite is set around 1,500 gil, so I listed mine at 1,490, which it felt like a fair compromise. (?)

Tbh I don’t really think that kind of undercutting really damages the market in any way 🤔😅

I’ve mine Pyrite ores listed for an entire week... AND there are people selling it for 200 gil... 👺

Same thing with Raw Larimar. I, actually, was soo excited to be able to mine and sell it! 🙃

I would to ask if this is something normal and if I really should, hmm how to say.. concern for this(?)

I saw that, normally goes for around 1,000 gil per piece, yet some, let's call them... “smart dudes”, list it for 200–300 gil per piece..

I’m new to FFXIV, and yes, I made this mistake once before fully understand how the interface of the market and the app, the retainer etc.. work..

I realized I messed up, corrected the price, and moved on.

But I see this becoming so constant, and it ends up ruining mine experience and the gaming exp for other miners and players as well. I believe..

I wake up in the morning, take my coffee, spend three chill hours mining ⛏️… and then I see this stuff on the market board, and honestly, it putting me down :/

My opinion, Square Enix should seriously consider implementing a minimum selling price.

Just thinking... it makes no sense.

If you’re able to farm 99 stacks of 99 items each, don’t you want 1,000 gil per piece? 🤔🤯

Why on earth would you sell everything for 200?

Am I wrong? Did I misunderstand how the things really work in FFX|V?

1qrsgdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1qrsgdy/to_the_person_i_hurt_the_most/,To the person I hurt the most.,"A..

I’ll never have the chance to speak these words to you in a way that would soothe my personal pain. I’ve come to realize, over time, how wrong it would be to send out my own pain and throw my emotions at you to absolve my guilt. These past nine months have been some of the hardest and most eye-opening of my life.

In the wake of our relationship, I did and said some things I regret more than any pain I have ever caused myself or anyone else. I was harsh, scared, and controlling instead of letting you leave to start the life you needed. I held you close when you needed to be left alone. I was brooding, rude, and a horrible partner to you. I disrespected your friends and family in an attempt to absolve my guilt and control you into coming back to me.

I don’t know where the line started — where I began needing validation outside of you — but it happened, and I never told you the truth. Even though I know the truth didn’t matter to you at that point and you were already gone. I never put your needs and emotions above mine while acting like I did everything for you. I lied. I cheated. I manipulated you into being who I wanted you to be.

As more time passes, I still don’t have a solid answer as to why I did it. One of the last things you told me was that I still held love for my AP. I know I continued to see my AP after we broke up and you left. The truth is much farther from me ever loving AP — I genuinely, with every fiber of my being, despise the person she is and the person she helped me become. If I had to make sense of it, I would say I had an unresolved trauma bond and connection to my AP that you paid the price for, because I didn’t take the time to end things clearly and cleanly before starting something new with you.

I let you believe you were part of my life in a position where I needed closeness and help, when in reality all I needed was to be left alone to think and process. None of that pain was yours to carry.

You were always such a light in my life and an inspiration to do better. I wouldn’t have come back to school — let alone gotten close to graduating — without you. Now I look at this diploma and feel nothing but disgust and disdain for an accomplishment that was built on a lie.

You had so much love in your heart, even during your anger, and I wanted to learn how to be like you. You didn’t care about people’s flaws and trusted that things would work out as they should. We were complete opposites in how we valued life, and I kept you close because I wanted to become the best version of myself — the version you believed I could be.

Your family was truly kind to me, even while being able to see who I really was behind the face I put on. I’m so grateful you have that support in your life, even if at times it feels selective or distant. I won’t ever forget the family we built between the two of us.

We were too young to truly know what we wanted from each other, and I won’t pretend we were always perfect. Through all the hurt I’ve caused and all the glory I give to our past love, I remember our fights, our weaknesses, and our misalignments. The moments when you just needed my love, affection, or reassurance — to know I needed you the way you needed me — and I screamed, yelled, and told you to stop talking. I told you that you were wrong, when deep down you knew I wasn’t really there with you. Humans are far more perceptive than I ever gave credit for.

You showed me what life with a loving partner could look like, and I will never forget the love and affection you gave me. I will forever cherish the life we built together. I still hold onto the hobbies and food tastes we shared. I still make the potato snacks. I still make grilled cheese in the waffle maker. I still drink Dr Pepper — I didn’t even like it before you.

I wish the Taco Bell workers could tell you I still order the same thing every time. I wish the clerk at 7-11 could tell you I still buy the same overly sugary coffee we used to get. I wish you could see the pain I carry to this day from losing you.

I look for pieces of you in all the places we used to go, the things we used to do, and the plans that could have been ours. Sometimes I make myself sleep on the floor to remind myself of when we started, at your grandma’s, the first night we ever slept next to each other. When I drive near City Park, I go out of my way to pass your old foster mom’s place, remembering you leaning out and yelling.

Ironically, when I saw you in T Town in that Subaru, I felt nothing. I couldn’t even make eye contact. I’ve grown and changed so much — and so have you. I don’t think you would have recognized me without seeing my car.

I promised you safety and love that I never delivered. I realize now that your brother was right to call me a threat to you, time and time again. I would never ask you to come back or give me another chance, but I miss you more as the days pass and as I reach new milestones. I listen to music that reminds me of us so I don’t forget what I lived through — or what I lost.

I genuinely hope you’ve stayed safe and are living a real, happy life. Please never stop smiling or being the best person I’ve ever known.

Thank you for everything.

I will always cherish your memory.",1,1769833537.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.99,False

They recommended the norm two flavors and said they also added strawberry instead of a strawberry soft top. I think if I were to try it again, Id stick to straw soft top. The fruityness overpowered the other flavors and made the coffee taste very weird.

The last weekend, I had a conversation with my wife and her sister. My sister in law works for a chain coffee shop, and has for 5ish years. It turns out, she makes as much money as I do (high $20s). 

I'm in charge of a department in a hospital,  I'm a clinician, and I have a masters degree with 10+ years experience. 

I'm very thankful for my job, but it really took the wind out of my sails to hear her say she makes as much as me. She's not lying, I saw her paycheck.

Anyway, I'm not mad at her. I'm also not trying to whine, it's just cathartic to write this out. My frustrations needed to be put to paper, so to speak.

I’m the founder of Scriptique, a BYOK (Google API Key), mobile-first, AI-powered podcasting studio in your pocket. You never have to buy a mic, audio editing equipment or use your own voice...EVER. Scriptique allows you to create entirely unique shows using AI hosts by way of text-to-speech technology.

These AI hosts aren't your run-of-the-mill robotic voices. They are about as indistinguishable from human hosts by way of advanced, careful tuning by the Scriptique team. Our app will let you go in-depth as to how your AI host's personality is designed. Featuring an advanced identity and back story studio, you can choose to use ""AI Transparency"" mode where the hosts can subtly disclose their artificial nature throughout an episode or design your host to be as life-like as possible for creating an entirely unique show.

If you’ve been lurking in side-hustle subreddits looking for a way to generate income without buying a $500 mic or spending 10 hours a week editing ""umms"" and ""ahhs"" out of audio, this is for you.

We’ve officially launched, and we’re here to turn the ""someday"" podcast into a ""today"" reality.

# ⚡ Why We Built It

The barrier to entry for podcasting is still too high. Most people quit before they start because they think they need a soundproof room and a radio voice.

Scriptique removes that friction. If you can navigate a mobile app, you can launch a polished, income-ready podcast. It’s about giving modern creators the precision of a professional studio with the effort of a text message.

# 🔥 Founder Edition Sale — Live Right Now

The Founder Edition includes:

* ♾️ Unlimited everything: Scripts, Episodes, and Series.
* 🧠 All Host Personas: Access our full range of exquisite AI voices.

# 🫶 A Personal Note

I built Scriptique because I believe a great idea shouldn't be silenced by a lack of expensive equipment. We wanted to create something that feels premium, fast, and empowering.

I’d love for you to jump in, try it out, and tell me what you think. Your feedback will shape the future of this studio.

With the exception of Gwen, who is an important character in the story and instantly realizes the absurd scene that’s happening.

This happens because the world’s canon protects him from having his identity revealed, causing these coincidences to occur and preventing anyone from discovering that he is Spider-Man.

Gwen is not part of Miles’s universe, so she’s the only one who notices, and this repeats itself in several other scenes. Like when a bystander notices Peter B. Parker climbing a wall, but when it’s Miles’s turn, he drops his coffee.

  
*Jujutsu Kaisen* (2020) — Within the rules of jujutsu, explaining to your opponent how your cursed technique works ends up strengthening and enhancing it, increasing its efficiency. This happens, for example, when Hanami explains to Megumi that if he uses his energy, the roots will grow faster inside him, immediately adding, “for some reason, this happens faster when I explain it.”

This explains why, in most fights, techniques are explained. It’s even used as a strategy, like when Todo only explains half of his technique to Hanami to deceive him and make him fall for a bluff, since that would be more advantageous than simply having his technique strengthened.",12,1769832568.0,TopCharacterTropes,5,1.0,False

1qrrxw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1qrrxw7/the_psychology_of_change_how_microdecisions/,The Psychology of Change: How Micro-Decisions Actually Rewire Your Life (Backed by Science),"Look, you're stuck. Maybe not in a dramatic, life-falling-apart kind of way. But you know
something's off. You're scrolling through the same feeds, having the same conversations, living
the same Tuesday on repeat. And somewhere deep down, you're screaming for something
different. I spent months researching this phenomenon, digging through behavioral psychology,
neuroscience studies, podcasts with top performers, and I found something wild: most advice
about change is backwards. We've been lied to about how transformation actually works.
The truth? Change doesn't come from massive motivation or waiting for the perfect moment. It
comes from weaponizing one thing nobody talks about: micro-decisions. The tiny choices you
make in the next five minutes will determine whether you're still stuck here a year from now or
living a completely different life.
## Step 1: Stop Waiting for Rock Bottom
Here's what the research shows: waiting for a crisis to force change is the slowest, most painful
path. Stanford behavioral scientist BJ Fogg spent decades studying habit formation and found
that motivation is unreliable as hell. You know what works? Designing your environment so the
right choices become automatic.
Right now, look at your phone. What apps are on your home screen? If it's Instagram, TikTok,
and Twitter, congrats, you've designed your life for distraction. Move them. Put a book app, a
meditation app, or literally anything that serves your goals in those prime spots. Ash is solid for
daily mental health check-ins and relationship advice that actually makes sense. Finch is great if
you need something gamified to build habits without feeling like you're forcing it.
This isn't about willpower. It's about making the good choice the easy choice.
## Step 2: Identify Your Keystone Habit
Not all habits are created equal. Some habits create a domino effect that transforms everything
else. Charles Duhigg nailed this in *The Power of Habit*. He found that people who start
exercising suddenly start eating better, being more productive, and even managing money
differently. Exercise becomes the keystone that unlocks other changes.
Your keystone habit might be:
* Waking up 30 minutes earlier
* Reading for 20 minutes daily
* Going to the gym three times a week
* Journaling every morning
Pick ONE. Not five. Not three. ONE habit that you know, deep in your gut, would create ripples
across your entire life. Then build everything around protecting that habit like it's sacred.
## Step 3: Kill Your Escape Hatches
You sabotage yourself with escape hatches. These are the little excuses you pre-install: ""I'll start
Monday,"" ""I need to research more first,"" ""I'm just not ready yet."" Bullshit. You're building
yourself an easy exit before you even begin.
James Clear talks about this in *Atomic Habits*, the bestselling book that's genuinely changed
millions of lives. He's a habit expert who built a massive following by making behavior change
stupidly simple. His core insight? Make bad habits hard and good habits easy. Want to stop
doom scrolling? Delete the apps. Not just log out. Delete them. Make the friction so high that
your lazy brain gives up.
Want to start running? Sleep in your gym clothes. Put your shoes by the door. Remove every
possible excuse between you and the action.
## Step 4: Use the 2-Minute Rule to Trick Your Brain
Your brain is designed to resist change. It wants comfort, predictability, safety. So you've got to
outsmart it. The 2-Minute Rule from James Clear is criminally effective: any new habit should
take less than two minutes to do.
Want to read more? Don't commit to reading a chapter. Commit to reading one page. Want to
meditate? Don't aim for 20 minutes. Aim for taking three deep breaths. Want to write? Just write
one sentence.
This sounds stupid simple, but it works because it removes the psychological barrier. Once you
start, momentum takes over. You'll read more than one page. You'll meditate longer than three
breaths. But the key is lowering the activation energy so starting feels effortless.
## Step 5: Stack Your Habits Like a Pro
Habit stacking is where the magic happens. This is about linking a new behavior to something
you already do automatically. BJ Fogg's research shows that anchoring new habits to existing
routines makes them stick way faster.
Here's how it works:
* After I pour my morning coffee, I'll read for 10 minutes
* After I brush my teeth at night, I'll write three things I'm grateful for
* After I close my laptop for the day, I'll do 10 pushups
You're hijacking your existing neural pathways instead of trying to build new ones from scratch.
Your brain already knows how to pour coffee. Now it'll learn that reading comes next.
For anyone who wants to go deeper into these concepts but doesn't have the time to read
through dozens of books like *Atomic Habits* or *The Power of Habit*, there's an AI learning
app called BeFreed that's been useful. A friend who works at Google recommended it to me.
It pulls from psychology research, expert interviews, and books on behavior change to create
personalized audio content. You type in something specific like ""build better habits as someone
who's tried and failed before"" and it generates a custom learning plan with podcasts tailored to
your exact situation. You can adjust the depth from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute
deep dive with examples and context, and even pick the voice style. Makes absorbing all this
research way more digestible when you're commuting or at the gym.
## Step 6: Track Everything, Feel Everything
Look, if you're not tracking, you're lying to yourself about your progress. Get a habit tracker. It
can be as simple as a piece of paper with boxes to check off or an app like Streaks. The point is
to create visual proof that you're showing up.
But here's the deeper part: attach emotion to your tracking. Dr. Andrew Huberman, the
neuroscientist behind the insanely popular Huberman Lab podcast, explains that dopamine is
released not just from achievement but from the pursuit itself. When you check off that box,
celebrate it. Literally feel proud. Say ""hell yeah"" out loud.
Your brain needs to associate the action with positive emotion, not just obligation.
## Step 7: Find Your People or Stay Stuck
You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. If those five people are
stuck, complaining, and avoiding growth, guess what? You'll stay stuck too. This isn't judgment,
it's just reality.
Join communities where the behavior you want is the norm. If you want to read more, join a
book club or online reading community. If you want to get fit, find a workout partner or group
class. If you want to build a business, surround yourself with entrepreneurs.
The Huberman Lab podcast is great for understanding the science behind behavior change,
focus, and performance. Andrew Huberman breaks down complex neuroscience into actionable
protocols that actually work. Episodes on dopamine, motivation, and habit formation are
goldmines.
## Step 8: Embrace the Suck, Then Keep Going
Here's what nobody tells you: change feels like shit at first. Your brain will throw tantrums. You'll
want to quit. You'll feel uncomfortable, awkward, and like you're failing. That's normal. That's not
a sign you're doing it wrong. It's a sign you're doing it right.
The research is clear: it takes about 66 days on average for a new behavior to become
automatic, not the mythical 21 days everyone parrots. So give yourself permission to suck for
two months. Show up anyway. The discomfort is temporary. Staying the same is permanent.
## Step 9: Burn the Ships
This is the nuclear option, but it works. When Cortés landed in Mexico, he burned his ships so
his men couldn't retreat. You need to do the same with your excuses.
Tell people your goals publicly. Put money on the line with apps like Beeminder that charge you
real cash if you don't follow through. Quit your escape routes. Make going back more painful
than moving forward.
*Indistractable* by Nir Eyal is incredible for this. Eyal spent years researching why we get
distracted and how to build a life where you control your attention instead of it controlling you.
The book gives you frameworks to design your environment and schedule so that distraction
isn't even an option. Seriously one of the best productivity books out there.
## Step 10: Decide Who You Are
This is the real shift. Stop saying ""I want to be someone who works out."" Start saying ""I am
someone who works out."" Identity drives behavior way more than goals do. When you see
yourself as a reader, you read. When you see yourself as a fit person, you move your body.
When you see yourself as disciplined, you act disciplined.
Every action you take is a vote for the person you're becoming. You don't need to win every
vote. You just need to win the majority. So cast your votes wisely, starting right now.
The fastest way to change your life isn't some grand plan or perfect strategy. It's the decision
you make in the next five minutes. And the five minutes after that. String enough of those
decisions together, and you'll wake up six months from now unrecognizable in the best possible
way.",3,1769832065.0,psychesystems,1,1.0,False

Nanny of 10yrs turned Doula here. This will be a bit long...

I've been a doula PT for 5yrs and officially went FT in Aug. I've been working with a small number of families for a large number of hours but I've recently been looking for ways to teach on a group level. I have a few niche specialties and certificates related to fertility, postpartum, and infant sleep. One of these certifications, that I got 3yrs ago, I have been the only person in my city to offer. It's been a bit isolating, a lot of my online peers have other people locally that they collab with. I'm in a pretty spread out city with nearly 1m people so there's absolutely room for many of us. 

I'm not super active on socials but I've been gearing up for it. I got a new follower and hey she's in my niche and my city. We also trained through the same program. I sent them a message saying I was excited to see someone else locally. They certified last year while my site was hidden for Mat leave so I think we just missed each other. We had a nice back and forth about the city they are 30min from me clear across town. I said we should get coffee or tea and talk about our work, maybe a collab? They said a week from now and we picked a location but left off there and I planned to confirm today.

Well in the meantime I've been talking with this yoga studio to host a little pop up workshop. They said last minute I could have a day next week due to a cancelation or wait another month for a spot. I accepted and spent the evening putting together my materials for the pop up. I made a post about it around 9pm and went to bed. 

Midday I go to reply to the other trainers message and I see they have posted (about 15hrs after me) they are doing a workshop with the same names at the same day and time as mine. It just felt a little weird. While a niche certification we teach and advertise how we want. I see a lot of my peers host workshops and reach out events, everyone has their own spin on it. But this post was almost word for word mine. I tried to talk myself off of it today then I looked up where they're hosting it. It's at a park 3min from the yoga studio I'll be at. Maybe a coincidence but I know it's nearly 30min from where she said she lives and not the only park by any means. Again we're in a large city there's  at least 60 public parks alone. Also they have only hosted one other workshop from their social media history so it's not like they host a new thing every week or even month. It just doesn't feel like coincidence and I'm just a bit baffled by it

1qrrsbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalFiction/comments/1qrrsbh/unsafe_passage/,Unsafe Passage,"Eighteen miles off the cape, we spot a schooner bearing west, flying the green skull pennant of Commodore Savings & Loan.

We fire a cannon in the other direction, and run up our own colors, showing friendly.

“Invite her captain to breakfast,” I say, walking into my cabin.

“The whole coast has surrendered,” says the captain, ramming down his meal. Pan-fried anchovies and beer.

“Surrendered to who?” I say.

“One of the tribal lords. T’Kuhmsa, I think.” His eyes are hollow and bloodshot.

I shoot a secret glare to my steward, Mrs. Fielding. She nods to the brewing kettle and shrugs with barely-concealed insolence.

But my guest is distracted, remote. He finishes two more glasses of wine and slumps back into his chair. I get the feeling he doesn’t care whether the gold his schooner carries is captured or sunk, so long as he’s allowed to sleep.

“Where’s your escort?” I ask.

“Burned to the water before we ever left the Sound. It wasn’t pirates. Someone dropped a candle in her powder-room.”

Through the bulkhead come the working sounds of our sloop, muffled hammering, chisels clanking. At first he winces, like his head can’t take the noise. But then his eyes open, curious at the sound and struggling to wake some part of his brain that might recognize it.

“You’re a scientific vessel,” he says in a tone that can’t be distinguished as either a statement or question.

Our conversation is cut short by the lookout’s hail: “Land ho!”

I frown. We’re not sailing at the moment; if the cape has come into view that means the inshore tide is pulling with uncommon strength.

“You’d best sail in line with us, sir,” I tell him.

Back on deck, my nostrils start burning, the rising sun veiled by a black haze in the east.

I check my pocket watch, impatient while the schooner’s captain stumbles to the rail and his waiting rowboat. As he turns to climb down the ladder, he sees our crew chipping cannonballs, smoothing imperfections and wiping them clean with studiously-plied rags.

Once again he seems curious, perturbed. But then our sloop gives sharp roll and he slips, falling back into the bottom of his boat. As he’s rowed back to the schooner, he leans over the side and vomits.

Mrs. Fielding brings my coffee and cigar case from the cabin. “Pass the word for Mr. Blythe,” I say.

My first mate appears, breathing hard, covered in sweat, tar, and rope burns. But he’s smiling.

“I’ll answer for that new topmast, anywhere this side of the Horn,” he says. He nods to the schooner, rising and falling alongside us.  “Shall I pass them a line, sir?”

South we run, both vessels fighting the tide as it threatens to pull us closer against hostile shores. More sails begin dotting the sea around us, merchants, trawlers, transports, all manner of craft fleeing T’Kuhmsa’s raid in one direction or another.

One of them, a large whaler, hails us and backs her sails. The sailing master asks why we’re standing in for the cape, particularly with a banking vessel in tow, while the coastline falls to pieces.

“You may as well hand that gold to the pirates,” he says. Independent corsairs paid by T’Kuhmsa are plying up and down the channel, ready to snatch up any ships of value. There’s been no sign of the heavy frigates sent by General Campbell to protect us.

With a resounding thump, my crew runs out the full line of cannons along our starboard side. A dozen eighteen-pounders ready to fire point-blank in the whaler’s hull. The friendly flag at our masthead comes racing down, replaced by the dreaded crossed-hatchet banner.

I give the master an apologetic glance. He’s quicker than the schooner’s captain, and grim understanding washes over his features.

He says, “You are the pirates.”",0,1769831624.0,HistoricalFiction,0,0.5,False

The impending winter storm 2 electric boogaloo must be keeping everyone at home. The only hiccup was someone for whom the agreed upon hotel policy was suddenly an inconvenience that they wanted to make my problem.

Namely, they wanted to use the card they'd booked the room with to pay the security deposit. However, the card wasn't at the hotel, which we require. The guy kept insisting he could get me the card tomorrow, but there isn't much point in getting a security deposit out of someone AFTER they check out.

Then his mom calls, because she booked him the room and wanted to pay the deposit as well. She wanted to give the card number over the phone, which I explained we don't accept. The card and cardholder have to be present at the hotel. Then she decided she was entitled to a refund because ""we were unable to accommodate her."" I of course denied the refund, because we were happy to accommodate them. They just had to pay the deposit, like they agreed when they booked the room. He'd stayed with us before too, so it's not like he didn't know about the deposit. They just decided, without asking, that it would be no problem for him to check in with a card that isn't here and isn't his.

After going back and forth with her for a minute she hung up on me and I was quite ready for my night to end. The phone rang again and I assumed it was them trying for another round, but instead someone else was on the phone and he said he wanted to make a complaint.

I rolled my eyes and politely asked what the issue was because to get such a call at 10pm on a Friday meant the complaint was probably stupid. There's a prostitute in room 215 he told me. These are calls we get every once in awhile, and 100% of the time they are the result of some guy who either got rejected by a sex worker or has buyer's remorse or something in that wheelhouse. We're an economy motel, sex workers come with the territory and as long as they're not drawing attention to themselves we pretend we don't know.

So I played dumb even though I knew damn well that there was indeed a sex worker in 215. I asked how he knew there was a sex worker in that room, and he said he was staying in the room next door and there were men coming in and out of the room all day.

I asked him what room he was in, because I needed to confirm his story as this was a very serious accusation he was making. He told me he was in 216. I asked if he was sure 215 was the right room, because 216 was on the other side of the building (evens on one side, odds on the other). He said he was sure. Again I told him that 216 wasn't near that room so there must be some mistake. 

He claimed that he must have gotten his room number mixed up, so he was in 217. I asked if he was sure that was his room number, and he said it was. So I clarified again and asked if he was really sure, he said he was again. ""Sir, 217 is a storage room."" After a couple seconds of dead air, he hung up on me also.

I got a nice little chuckle, it really turned my mood around after dealing with people trying to make their problems mine. A moment later a guest came through the lobby to get coffee. As he left I bid him goodnight and he thanked me for the coffee. Then he held up three coffee cups and confirmed that it was okay he was taking that much. I said, ""Hey man, somebody's got to drink it!"" And he thanked me again.

Ah, the variety of guests. The people who think the rules shouldn't apply to them and the people who are worried they took too much free coffee.",43,1769831613.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3,1.0,False

But my guest is distracted, remote. He finishes two more glasses of wine and slumps back into his chair. I get the feeling he doesn’t care whether the gold his schooner carries is captured or sunk, so long as he’s allowed to sleep.

Our conversation is cut short by the lookout’s hail: “Land ho!”

I frown. We’re not sailing at the moment; if the cape has come into view that means the inshore tide is pulling with uncommon strength.

“You’d best sail in line with us, sir,” I tell him.

Back on deck, my nostrils start burning, the rising sun veiled by a black haze in the east.

I check my pocket watch, impatient while the schooner’s captain stumbles to the rail and his waiting rowboat. As he turns to climb down the ladder, he sees our crew chipping cannonballs, smoothing imperfections and wiping them clean with studiously-plied rags.

Once again he seems curious, perturbed. But then our sloop gives sharp roll and he slips, falling back into the bottom of his boat. As he’s rowed back to the schooner, he leans over the side and vomits.

Mrs. Fielding brings my coffee and cigar case from the cabin. “Pass the word for Mr. Blythe,” I say.

My first mate appears, breathing hard, covered in sweat, tar, and rope burns. But he’s smiling.

“I’ll answer for that new topmast, anywhere this side of the Horn,” he says. He nods to the schooner, rising and falling alongside us.  “Shall I pass them a line, sir?”

South we run, both vessels fighting the tide as it threatens to pull us closer against hostile shores. More sails begin dotting the sea around us, merchants, trawlers, transports, all manner of craft fleeing T’Kuhmsa’s raid in one direction or another.

One of them, a large whaler, hails us and backs her sails. The sailing master asks why we’re standing in for the cape, particularly with a banking vessel in tow, while the coastline falls to pieces.

“You may as well hand that gold to the pirates,” he says. Independent corsairs paid by T’Kuhmsa are plying up and down the channel, ready to snatch up any ships of value. There’s been no sign of the heavy frigates sent by General Campbell to protect us.

With a resounding thump, my crew runs out the full line of cannons along our starboard side. A dozen eighteen-pounders ready to fire point-blank in the whaler’s hull. The friendly flag at our masthead comes racing down, replaced by the dreaded crossed-hatchet banner.

I give the master an apologetic glance. He’s quicker than the schooner’s captain, and grim understanding washes over his features.

Decade long history of severe bloating. Having some questions…,"I’m in Bali and got the infamous “Bali Belly” twice within 3 weeks (vomiting diarrhea nausea and acid reflux). The second time the acid reflux was INSANE. I got some medications and was already worried, cause my gut is really fucked up.

mostly insane bloating, also on my upper belly, not just lower, independently of what I eat. It gets a bit better while fasting and also improved a bit on a keto diet but I found no long term relief. I always suspected SIBO however never tested for it.

A few days later, dark blood in my stool and feeling very weak. I went to a health clinic and they took it very seriously, drove me to the ER of a hospital where I stayed for 4 nights, got colonoscopy and endoscopy plus testing for H pylori (no results yet). 3 stomach ulcers were found.

I got prescribed 3 medications.

I will take then of course because I don’t want to risk it, but was a bit surprised about the acid reducer because I’ve never had acid reflux before and believe to have LOW stomach acid if anything, because my bile flow is inhibited because of a clogged liver (knowing this cause I’ve been doing liver flushes and big stones came out). I’ve heard of other people being prescribed acid reducers when in fact they needed MORE stomach acid and it fucked them up long-term. So I’m a bit worried this may just make it worse?

I’ve never had any stomach pain as others here in the group, my biggest issue was always the severe bloating and low energy/fatigue.

I also want to change my diet to the best of my abilities and really stick with it. Apart from the typical “no fried food, no junk food, no spicy, ideally no coffee” (the clinic also says no raw food for two weeks), is there anything else I should definitely avoid? The contradicting school of thoughts on food groups, diets etc gets me very confused.

Lastly, my assumption is the ulcers where there since some time and the Bali belly/acid reflux were just the last thing needed to make them bleed. So I guess it’s a good thing this happened because I would’ve not gotten a colonoscopy myself just like that.

1qrrdt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenLevelingUp/comments/1qrrdt8/how_to_be_disgustingly_articulate_the/,How to Be Disgustingly Articulate: The Science-Based Playbook That Actually Works,"I used to sound like a complete idiot whenever I opened my mouth. Not because I lacked ideas, but because my brain would short circuit the moment I tried to express them. Words would tumble out in the wrong order, I'd trail off mid sentence, or I'd just freeze completely. Watching confident people speak felt like watching magic.

Here's what nobody tells you though. Being articulate isn't some innate gift you're born with. It's a skill you build through specific practices, and the science backs this up. I've spent hundreds of hours consuming content from communication experts, linguists, podcasts, research papers, and honestly some weird rabbit holes on YouTube. What I found was that most people struggle with articulation because of a few fixable issues: scattered thinking, limited vocabulary exposure, and zero practice speaking out loud. The good news is these are all trainable.

**The first shift is reading more, but strategically.** Most people skim articles and scroll social media, which trains your brain for fragmented thinking. Instead, read books that challenge your language processing. **Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss** (former FBI hostage negotiator, bestselling author) completely changed how I structure persuasive communication. Voss breaks down the psychology behind influential speech patterns and teaches tactical empathy, which is basically the art of making people feel heard while steering conversations. This book will make you question everything you thought you knew about effective communication. The techniques are insanely practical like mirroring, labeling emotions, and calibrated questions that I started using them immediately in everyday conversations. Around 60 pages in, I realized I'd been communicating like a caveman my entire life.

**Thinking out loud is the next game changer.** Your brain needs repetition to wire new pathways for verbal expression. Start narrating your thoughts when you're alone. Describe what you're doing, explain concepts to an imaginary person, argue both sides of an issue. It feels ridiculous at first but this is literally how your brain learns to organize thoughts into coherent speech. I do this while cooking, driving, even in the shower. The goal is to eliminate that gap between thought and articulation.

**Expand your vocabulary through context, not memorization.** Download something like **Readlr** for bite sized articles across different topics, or honestly just follow accounts that share interesting long form content. When you encounter unfamiliar words, don't just look up the definition. See how they're used in multiple contexts. Your brain learns through pattern recognition, not rote memorization. I also got weirdly into etymology, understanding word origins makes them stick better and helps you use them accurately.

**Record yourself speaking about random topics for 2 minutes without stopping.** Pick literally anything. How coffee is made. Why you prefer dogs over cats. The plot of the last show you watched. Play it back and note where you stumble, use filler words, or lose coherence. It's uncomfortable as hell but you'll improve drastically within weeks. This exercise forces you to think on your feet and builds that muscle memory for smooth delivery.

**Listen to articulate speakers obsessively.** I'm talking podcasts, lectures, interviews. **The Jordan Harbinger Show** features guests who are masters of their fields and the conversations demonstrate high level articulation across different contexts. Pay attention to how guests structure their responses, how they use pauses, how they bridge between ideas. Your brain absorbs speech patterns subconsciously through exposure.

If you want a more structured approach to this, **BeFreed** is an AI learning app that creates personalized podcasts and learning plans based on whatever communication goal you set, like ""become more articulate in high-pressure conversations"" or ""master persuasive language as an introvert."" It pulls from communication books, linguistic research, and expert interviews to build content that fits your exact needs.

You control the depth too. Start with a 10-minute overview of rhetorical techniques, and if it clicks, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and breakdowns. The voice options are genuinely addictive, from a deep, smoky tone like Samantha in Her to more energetic styles that keep you locked in during commutes. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it makes the whole learning process way less dry and more like having an actual conversation about ideas that matter to you.

**Practice the PREP framework for structuring thoughts.** Point, Reason, Example, Point. Make your main statement, explain why, give a concrete example, then restate your point. This structure keeps you from rambling and gives your speech a natural flow. I use this constantly now, even in casual conversations, and people actually listen instead of zoning out.

**Slow down deliberately.** Most inarticulate speech comes from your mouth trying to keep pace with your racing thoughts. Speak 20% slower than feels natural. Use pauses strategically. Silence isn't awkward, it's powerful. It gives you time to formulate and gives listeners time to process.

The transformation doesn't happen overnight but it compounds quickly. After a few months of deliberate practice, you'll notice people leaning in when you speak, asking follow up questions, actually remembering what you said. Your thoughts will translate to words with way less friction. You'll stop feeling like there's this intelligent person trapped inside who can't communicate properly.

Start with one practice today. Read one chapter of a challenging book. Record yourself speaking for 2 minutes. Your future self will thank you for building this skill now.",1,1769830471.0,MenLevelingUp,0,1.0,False

1qrrc71,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1qrrc71/curious_to_know_peoples_views_insights_on_whats/,Curious to know people’s views / insights on what’s been happening in Patagonia (the fires / Israelis / weird ass president).,"I’m British living in Colombia and very, very clued up on Israelis past and current behaviour - whether it be secretive or out in the open, however when I came to Latin America 5 years ago, it wasn’t really a country people paid any attention to, let alone discussed. 

However, in recent months, hatred for both Israel and let’s just say, its inhabitants’ views and attitudes towards some things, has skyrocketed. I’ve actually been surprised to see a grouping of countries so quickly wake up and smell the correct coffee on an issue the likes of which entire countries have tried to lie about and obfuscate. 

So, I ask, what do you all believe actually happened down in Patagonia? The many videos of Israeli tourists lighting small fires, boldly smoking cigarettes, claiming them to be nothing more than innocent backpackers. 

When it comes to the reasoning - a friend of mine who works down here in independent journalism has heard rumours that not only are large swathes of the land being burned to buy it up cheap, but soon there are plans to enact further damage to it though biological or toxicological means, and once the land is essentially unusable - they have two bargaining chips: 

1. An Argentine president so up Israel’s backside that it would shock me little, if at all, that he’s already had his Metzitzah B’peh done and a star on David tattooed on the now exposed tip. An Argentine president who thinks himself Jewish by wearing a musty Kippah and crying at the wall - and so is ripe for (as well as Argentine elites being extorted) emotional backmail that Israel will push for Patagonia  - Argentinas history of harbouring Nazis who fled along the rat lines after the war. 

Again I don’t know if the above is true - it’s just hearsay close the journalism ground here. But curious to see what people here say. 

All I will say is that Israel normally needs heavy and intensely tentacled, complex tactics to get what it wants, but in Argentina they essentially have a president who will kiss their feet first. 

We already have Israel’s national water company, Mekorot, expanding rapidly in Argentina in recent years. A useful tool in land development. 

So - is it after Patagonia? Why? How? ",1,1769830336.0,conspiracy,1,0.6,False

Like, you meet them once and suddenly you're telling your friends about them three weeks later. Meanwhile, most dates feel like automated job interviews where both people are reading from the same boring script.

I got curious about this after going on what felt like my 50th forgettable coffee date. So I went deep: researched attachment theory, watched hours of Matthew Hussey's content, read behavioral psychology studies, listened to relationship podcasts until my Spotify wrapped was embarrassing. Turns out, being memorable isn't about being the loudest or funniest person in the room. It's way more nuanced than that.

Here's what actually moves the needle:

**Stop performing, start connecting**

Most people treat dates like auditions. They rehearse stories, plan jokes, curate this perfect version of themselves. But here's the thing: people don't remember perfect. They remember real. Psychologist Arthur Aron's research on interpersonal closeness shows that vulnerability and authentic self disclosure creates way more connection than impressive achievements ever could.

Matthew Hussey talks about this concept of ""generous listening"" in his work. It's not just nodding while planning your next witty comeback. It's actually being present enough to catch the subtle things, the half mentioned detail about their childhood dog, the way their energy shifts when they talk about their job. That's where real conversation lives.

Try this: when they finish talking, pause for like two seconds before responding. Sounds weird but it signals you're actually processing what they said instead of just waiting for your turn to speak. Game changer.

**Become genuinely curious about their inner world**

Generic questions get generic answers. ""What do you do?"" leads to the same rehearsed elevator pitch they've given 47 times. Instead, the podcast ""Where Should We Begin"" with Esther Perel completely changed how I think about questions. She goes deep fast, not through invasive questions but through genuine curiosity about someone's perspective.

Ask things like ""what's something you believed as a kid that you don't anymore?"" or ""what's the best decision you made last year?"" These aren't interview questions. They're invitations into someone's actual thoughts. And when they answer, follow the thread. Don't just jump to your version of the story. Stay in theirs for a bit.

The book ""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller breaks down how different attachment styles show up in early dating. Understanding this helps you read between the lines when someone talks about past relationships or their relationship with family. You start picking up on the deeper patterns instead of just the surface story.

**Create a sensory experience they'll remember**

Memory research shows our brains tag experiences with sensory details. That's why a certain song can transport you back to a specific moment years later. So don't just meet at the same generic bar everyone uses.

Take them somewhere with a specific vibe. A bookstore with a weird rare book section. A neighborhood they've never explored. A place that serves food they've mentioned wanting to try. The specificity is what matters. It signals you were paying attention and you put actual thought into this.

Dr. Helen Fisher's neuroscience research on attraction shows that novel experiences literally trigger dopamine production. Your brain chemistry shifts when you're doing something new. That rush gets associated with the person you're with. So yeah, mini golf might seem cheesy but it works because it's different.

**Master the art of playful tension**

This isn't about playing games or being manipulative. It's about creating that electric back and forth that makes conversation fun. Matthew Hussey calls it ""collaborative play"" where you're building something together in real time through banter and light teasing.

But here's the key: it has to come from genuine affection, not from trying to seem cool or aloof. There's a massive difference between playful challenge and just being mean. One creates chemistry, the other creates distance.

The book ""Models"" by Mark Manson has this insanely good breakdown of how attraction actually works versus how we think it works. Spoiler: being agreeable and nice all the time doesn't create attraction. Having a perspective and being willing to disagree playfully does. It shows you're comfortable in your own skin.

**Be specific with your compliments**

""You're beautiful"" lands flat because they've heard it a thousand times. ""I love how your whole face changes when you talk about your sister"" hits different because it's specific and shows you're paying attention to details beyond the surface.

Relationship researcher John Gottman's work shows that specific positive observations create way more connection than generic praise. Your brain knows the difference between autopilot compliments and ones that required actual observation.

**End on a high note and follow through**

Don't drag the date out until you've exhausted all possible conversation topics. Leave when things are still good. It creates anticipation instead of exhaustion. And then, and this seems obvious but people mess it up constantly, actually follow up.

If you want to go deeper into dating psychology without spending weeks reading every book and study, there's BeFreed. It's an AI learning app built by Columbia grads that turns relationship books, expert talks, and research into personalized audio learning. 

You just tell it your goal, like ""become more magnetic on dates as an introvert,"" and it pulls insights from dating experts like Esther Perel, Matthew Hussey, and books like Attached or Models to create a custom learning plan just for you. The depth is adjustable too, quick 10-minute summaries when you're busy or 40-minute deep dives with real examples when you want details. Plus you can pick voices that actually keep you engaged, even a smoky one that sounds like Scarlett Johansson. Makes the commute or gym time way more productive than doomscrolling.

Send a text referencing something specific from your conversation. Not ""had a great time"" but ""still thinking about what you said about your year in Berlin, would love to hear more about that."" It proves you were actually listening and you're interested in the continuation of the conversation, not just the date itself.

Look, being unforgettable isn't about being perfect or having the most interesting life. It's about being present enough to create a genuine moment with another person. Most people are so caught up in managing their own anxiety and image that they forget the whole point is connection. When you shift your focus from ""am I impressive enough"" to ""am I actually seeing this person,"" everything changes. The memorable part takes care of itself.",1,1769830291.0,Datingat21st,0,1.0,False

1qrraiv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qrraiv,I made the 150 hour chocolate cake. I have questions.,"Hi all! Long time lurker/admirer of bakers, first time poster.

A couple of weeks ago, u/bezalil posted this cake and I thought it would be fun to give it a shot. Last week I knew I'd be stuck in the house for several days due to the impending ice storm, so I bought the ingredients and tried my hand at it. Sorry this is so long; apparently I don't know how to talk about baking without using a lot of words.

I don't really consider myself a baker. The most complicated desserts I've made were an orange chocolate tart and a lemon roulade cake, both from the Great British Bakeoff Masterclass. Other than that, it's pretty much been cookies and a couple of pies. I thought this cake recipe sounded like a fun challenge at my level - no difficult techniques, just a bunch of steps.

I tried my best to copy the recipe exactly. The one thing I changed was I baked the cakes as soon as I mixed the batter. The general consensus on this step seemed to be that cakes won't rise if you leave them in the fridge overnight; I wanted fluffy cake so I just baked them right away. Despite this, they still didn't really rise. They're not as compact as the cakes in the videos, but they definitely didn't rise as I expected.

**My questions** (most of them have to do with the butter-infused bourbon, lol):

1. When I the filtered the butter out of the bourbon, there was what I call brown butter ""sludge"" left behind. Was I supposed to add this into the butter pan or toss it? Nobody talks about this. I did see that David Seymour included it in his video, so I did as well.
2. The recipe calls for 1/2 cup of bourbon. After the bourbon was filtered, there was 1/4 cup left. I wasn't sure if I should add more bourbon to get it back up to 1/2 cup, but I figured it was common sense that you're going to lose some liquid when infusing/straining and if I was supposed to top it off after straining, the recipe would say that. So I didn't top off the bourbon. Was this the right call?
3. Whyyyyy the infusion at all? The butter and the bourbon go into the same mix at the same time. What is the point? What did infusing it accomplish?
4. I stirred the coffee beans into the cream every once in awhile during the day time. I thought this might help with the infusion flavor (since the beans floated to the top) as well as the whole thing of ending up with a ""brick"" of refrigerated coffee and cream. I don't know that this was needed. I did end up with very heavily flavored coffee cream and I didn't have a brick so that's great, but was this just unnecessary extra work?
5. I forgot to put the cake in the fridge overnight before adding mousse and ganache to the outside. It didn't seem to cause any problems. What's the reason for that final refrigeration?

**My takeaways:**

\--I didn't give a lot of thought to adding the chocolate chunks to the cake batter, but once it was cooked I realized I should have chopped those up much smaller. They don't really melt in the oven and just end up being big(ish) hard chunks of chocolate in the cake.

\--The amount of mousse was a problem. David says in his video that Alvin doubled the mousse recipe he used from the Cooking Tree. He verbally listed the ingredients, which matched doubling the Cooking Tree's video. However, in his video description, he listed these ingredients at 300% the amount, not 200%. I didn't know which amounts to use, so I went with his verbal instructions and it was the wrong call. On top of that, I somehow completely screwed up the amount of cream to mix with the powdered sugar (that one's on me). I didn't have enough mousse and ended up with very thin layers, which is a real bummer.

\--Speaking of the mousse, the whole coffee bean infusion ended up being pointless. My kids said the original was way too coffee-flavored and they hated it (luckily I had them taste it before I put it on the cake). I also hate coffee so I couldn't be mad about it, lol. I remade it with just regular cream. I thought the coffee would enhance the chocolate, not actually stand out on its own. I kinda feel like the name of the recipe should involve the word coffee, because using infused cream in the mousse and ganache is definitely going to give the cake a strong coffee flavor.

\--I made the cakes square because I felt like that would waste less cake. And I don't have a cake ring. And it was the easiest choice. And nobody gives AF about cake shape.

\--Unfortunately, I can't give you my personal opinion on the outcome because I don't like chocolate cake, lol. And I \*really\* dislike dark chocolate. I made it for fun and because my family loves it. Their reviews were positive, yay! My oldest son, who is AuDHD and extremely picky, really enjoyed it. Everyone said it was easily the best chocolate cake I've made, but no one would commit to it being the best chocolate cake ever.  So take that FWIW.

In the end, I'm annoyed by my mousse mistakes, so even though it was a lot of work for something I don't even want to eat, I'll likely make it one more time to try to get it fully correct. I'm like that. Afterwards? It's back to regular ass chocolate cakes in this house. Nobody needs to spend this much time and effort on a cake on a regular basis! I'm happy to have done it but I don't feel like I'm going to revisit it often.

P.S. I've included the recipe I transcribed while watching David's video (having fixed the mousse section). Surprise, surprise, it's as wordy as this post. If any of my numbers are off, please let me know!",132,1769830196.0,Baking,13,0.95,False

1qrr8ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1qrr8ry/4_types_of_friends_that_determine_your_happiness/,4 Types Of Friends That Determine Your Happiness: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I spent way too much time studying friendship psychology, and holy shit, nobody talks about this enough. We obsess over romantic relationships but completely overlook the people we see most often. Turns out your friend group literally rewires your brain and predicts your future success more than your GPA or income. This isn't some fluffy self-help BS; this is legit, backed by the Harvard Study of Adult Development (the longest study on happiness ever conducted, 80+ years) and research from Robin Dunbar at Oxford.

I'm going to break down the 4 friendship archetypes that psychologists have identified. Most people don't even realize which category they fall into or who's actually in their circle. 

**1. The energy vampires (takers)**

You know exactly who I'm talking about. They only text when they need something. Every conversation circles back to their problems. They are not evil, just completely oblivious to reciprocity. Dr. Adam Grant's research in ""Give and Take"" (organizational psychologist at Wharton, bestselling author) shows these people don't just drain your time; they literally increase cortisol levels and fuck with your stress response. The wild part? Most takers don't see themselves as takers. They genuinely believe relationships are transactional and everyone operates this way.

Red flags: they disappear when you need support, dismiss your achievements, or make you feel guilty for having boundaries. Neuroscience shows that chronic exposure to one-sided relationships actually shrinks your hippocampus (the part of your brain that regulates emotion and memory). 

Action step: audit your last 10 conversations with each friend. If it's 80% them talking about their issues and 20% anything else, you have found your vampire. Don't ghost them, but definitely downgrade their access to your energy.

**2. The surface-level friends (matchers)**

These are your ""hey, let's grab coffee sometime"" people, who you never actually grab coffee with. They're pleasant, they'll like your Instagram posts, and they'll show up to your birthday party. But there's zero depth. Dr. Shasta Nelson (friendship expert, wrote ""Frientimacy"") calls this positivity without consistency or vulnerability. You're matching energy and matching effort, but neither person is willing to go deeper.

Here's what's interesting: the Dunbar number suggests we can only maintain about 150 casual relationships max, with only 5 people in our closest circle. Most people waste emotional bandwidth trying to keep 50+ surface friendships alive instead of investing in the 5 that actually matter.

These friendships aren't bad; they're just limited. They're your college roommate, whom you see once a year; your gym buddy with whom you only talk fitness; and your coworker, who's cool, but you'd never call crying at 2 am. The issue is when your ENTIRE friend group is surface-level. 

**3. The ride or dies (givers)**

These are criminally rare. They show up without being asked. They celebrate your wins without jealousy. They call you on your shit when you're self-sabotaging. Harvard's research found that people with at least ONE close relationship like this live longer, have better immune function, and report higher life satisfaction than people earning 6 figures.

Dr. Brené Brown's work on vulnerability (researcher at the University of Houston, 5 NYT bestsellers) explains why these friendships are so powerful: they create what she calls ""the sacred space"" where you can be fully seen without performance or pretense. Your nervous system literally regulates differently around these people. You can exist in comfortable silence. You don't have to be ""on.""

But here's the catch: these friendships require massive emotional investment, and most people are too scared to initiate that level of intimacy. We are so afraid of rejection or being ""too much"" that we never move past surface-level banter.

If you don't have at least one of these, that's your sign to either deepen an existing friendship or get intentional about finding your people. Join communities around your actual interests, not just convenience (your apartment building, your job). Try the app Ash for relationship coaching that helps you identify and strengthen these bonds.

**4. The growth catalysts (the rarest type)**

This is next-level shit. These people don't just support you; they actively challenge you to level up. They introduce you to new ideas, hold you accountable, and call out your limiting beliefs. Psychologist Dr. Carol Dweck's research on growth mindset shows that we literally become more adaptable and resilient when surrounded by people who model those traits.

Jim Rohn said, ""You're the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with,"" and neuroscience actually confirms this through mirror neurons. Your brain automatically mimics the behaviors, speech patterns, and even emotional states of people you're frequently around. 

I found this through Tim Ferriss's podcast episode with Naval Ravikant. They broke down how the quality of your peer group determines your ceiling. If everyone around you is comfortable with mediocrity, your brain will normalize that. If everyone's reading, building, and questioning, your baseline standards shift upward without conscious effort.

Growth catalyst friendships feel slightly uncomfortable because they're always pulling you forward. They'll call you out when you're making excuses. They'll recommend books that break your brain (check out ""The Road Less Traveled"" by M. Scott Peck, which sold 10M+ copies and literally changed how psychology views personal responsibility). They'll challenge your opinions without making you feel attacked.

**So which one are YOU?**

Most people reading this are probably matchers with occasional giver tendencies. That's fine. But here's what the research suggests: if you want a more fulfilling life, you need to either become a giver or find one. 

Practical shit you can do today:

1. Text 3 friends right now and ask how they're ACTUALLY doing. Not ""how are you?"" but ""what's been heavy on your mind lately?"" Vulnerability breeds vulnerability.

2. Use the app Finch to build better habits around checking in with people consistently. It gamifies the process so it doesn't feel like work.

3. Read ""Platonic"" by Dr. Marisa Franco (psychologist, friendship researcher). An insanely good breakdown of why modern friendship is broken and how to fix it. She explains the ""liking gap,"" where we consistently underestimate how much people like us after first meetings, which prevents a deeper connection.

If you want to go deeper into relationship psychology and social skills without dedicating hours to reading, there's this AI app called BeFreed that pulls from books like ""Platonic,"" research papers on attachment theory, and expert insights from therapists. it turns them into personalized audio learning plans, like building better boundaries with energy vampires or deepening connections with surface-level friends. You can customize the depth (10-minute overview or 40-minute deep dive with examples) and pick voices that actually keep you engaged. built by former Google engineers, so the content's all fact-checked and science-based. makes it way easier to internalize this stuff during commutes or workouts instead of just bookmarking articles you'll never revisit.

4. Practice ""generous assumptions,"" which is assuming people's intentions are good unless proven otherwise. Most friendship conflicts happen because we catastrophize (""they didn't text back; they must hate me"") when reality is way more boring (they got distracted).

The Harvard study's director literally said on record: ""The clearest message we get from this 75-year study is this: good relationships keep us happier and healthier, period""—not money, not status, not achievement. relationships.

Stop tolerating energy vampires out of politeness. Stop keeping surface-level friends on life support. Get ruthlessly intentional about who has access to your time and energy. Find your ride-or-dies and growth catalysts, or become one yourself.

And beside him, that female strategist stood close. One manicured hand rested lightly on his arm, fingers curled with easy ownership. She leaned in as he spoke, smiling like she belonged there.

My chest tightened.

“And as I’ve always said,” he continued, smiling out at the crowd, “this campaign is about family. About sacrifice. About the people who stand behind you when the cameras aren’t rolling.”

The camera cut to the strategist again. As if she was his wife. She squeezed his arm, beaming.

No mention of me.

The apartment felt too quiet. My reflection stared back at me from the blackened screen, pale, tired, eyes rimmed with shadows I hadn’t bothered to hide.

“So that’s it,” I whispered. ""It's time to divorce.""

————————

The conference room was too clean.

Glass table. White walls. Not a fingerprint in sight. It smelled faintly of lemon polish and money, sterile, deliberate, impossible to relax in. Elara sat with her hands folded in her lap, knees pressed together, spine straight like posture alone might keep her grounded.

Across from her, three people waited.

Two lawyers. One husband.

“This won’t take long,” one of the lawyers said, smiling like that was meant to be comforting. “Just standard procedure.”

Elara glanced at the stack of papers in front of him. Thick. Heavily tabbed. Her name typed neatly across the top.

Standard.

She looked at her husband. He was staring at the table, jaw tight, hands clasped together like he was holding himself back from something. Or maybe holding himself together.

“Standard for what?” she asked.

The other lawyer leaned forward. Female. Sharp eyes. Perfectly neutral lipstick. “Campaign protection,” she said. “Public image management. Confidentiality.”

Elara let out a short laugh before she could stop herself. “I am the campaign protection.”

No one laughed with her.

Her husband cleared his throat. “El, ”

“No,” she said quietly. “Don’t.”

The word landed harder than she intended. He flinched anyway.

The female lawyer slid a document toward her. “This is a non-disclosure agreement. It ensures discretion on all matters, past, present, and future, related to the campaign.”

Elara didn’t touch it.

“And after?” she asked.

“After what?”

“After the election,” Elara said. “After the victory speech I wrote. After the donors I wrangled. After the skeletons I buried.”

Silence stretched.

The male lawyer spoke again, voice smooth. “This protects everyone.”

Everyone.

Her stomach twisted. This time it didn’t pass.

Elara pressed a hand to her abdomen instinctively, breath catching as a sharper wave of nausea hit. She swallowed hard, willing it down. Not here. Not now.

“Are you okay?” her husband asked, finally looking at her.

She met his gaze. Held it.

“No,” she said. “I’m pregnant.”

The words dropped into the room like a glass shattering.

The female lawyer blinked once. The male lawyer’s eyebrows lifted in brief surprise before smoothing out again. Her husband went still. Completely, terrifyingly still.

“What?” he said.

Elara didn’t look away. “I’m pregnant.”

A beat.

Then another.

The female lawyer recovered first. “Congratulations,” she said automatically. Then, after a pause, “That… complicates things.”

Complicates.

Elara laughed again, sharp and humorless. “You mean humanizes.”

Her husband finally stood, pacing to the window. His hands curled into fists at his sides. “Why didn’t you tell me?”

She stared at his back. “I tried. You were always busy.”

He turned, frustration flaring. “This is not the time, ”

“Oh, I think it is,” she snapped.

The male lawyer cleared his throat. “This doesn’t change the necessity of the NDA.”

“Actually,” Elara said, leaning forward now, “it changes everything.”

The female lawyer tilted her head. “We’ll need to evaluate how this affects public perception.”

Public perception.

Elara pushed her chair back and stood. “You’re talking about my body like it’s a PR issue.”

Her husband stepped toward her. “Lower your voice.”

“No.”

The word rang louder than she expected.

“You don’t get to tell me how to exist anymore,” she said. “Not after everything I’ve done.”

He opened his mouth, then closed it. His eyes flicked briefly to the lawyers, then back to her. Avoiding. Always avoiding.

“Say something,” Elara demanded. “Tell them I’m not a liability.”

Silence.

The female lawyer sighed lightly, as if inconvenienced. “We can adjust language if necessary. Add clauses. But the agreement stands.”

Elara’s chest tightened. “And if I don’t sign?”

The room shifted. The air grew heavier.

Her husband finally spoke. “Then things get… messy.”

She stared at him. “Messy for who?”

“For the campaign.”

Of course.

She laughed again, but this time it shook. “You don’t even hear yourself.”

He looked pained. “I’m trying to protect us.”

“No,” she said softly. “You’re trying to protect you.”

The male lawyer slid a pen across the table. “This ensures privacy. Security. Stability.”

Elara picked it up. It was heavier than she expected. Cold. Solid.

“Does it protect my child?” she asked.

No one answered.

Her husband wouldn’t meet her eyes now.

The silence stretched until it became unbearable.

Elara sat back down slowly. Her hands trembled, but she didn’t hide it. She was done pretending strength meant silence.

“You want me quiet,” she said. “You want me erased.”

“That’s not fair,” her husband said quickly.

She looked up at him. “Then look at me.”

He didn’t.

That was her answer.

Elara flipped through the pages. Clause after clause. Restrictions. Limitations. Her voice, her work, her history, all neatly boxed and labeled confidential.

She reached the last page.

“Once I sign this,” she said, “I disappear.”

“No,” her husband said weakly. “You’ll always be my wife.”

The word tasted bitter now.

She met his eyes one last time. “For how long?”

He had no answer.

The room waited.

Elara took a breath. Then another. She thought of the nights. The sacrifices. The future she’d bent herself into believing in.

She thought of the life growing inside her.

She signed.

The pen felt heavier than it should have.

---

Elara watched the campaign launch from her couch.

She hadn’t planned to.

She’d told herself she wouldn’t. That she’d go for a walk, or take a nap, or do literally anything else that didn’t involve watching the man she’d built step into the spotlight without her. But the TV had been on in the background while she folded laundry, the volume low, the image nothing more than moving colors and shapes.

Until she heard his voice.

Confident. Warm. Familiar.

Her hands stilled around a half-folded shirt.

The camera panned wide, flags, supporters, flashing lights, and there he was. Standing tall behind the podium, shoulders squared, smile calibrated to perfection.

And beside him,

Elara’s chest tightened.

The media strategist stood close. Too close. One manicured hand rested lightly on his arm, fingers curled with easy ownership. She leaned in as he spoke, nodding at the right moments, smiling like she belonged there.

Like she’d always been there.

Elara sank slowly onto the couch.

The anchor’s voice droned on about momentum and vision, about a campaign that had “found its voice.” Elara almost laughed at that.

Found its voice.

Her words rolled out of his mouth, smooth and practiced. Phrases she’d agonized over at two in the morning. Lines she’d rewritten until they bled sincerity. The applause swelled right on cue.

She knew that pause. She’d built it.

“And as I’ve always said,” he continued, smiling out at the crowd, “this campaign is about family. About sacrifice. About the people who stand behind you when the cameras aren’t rolling.”

Elara stared at the screen.

Behind you.

The camera cut to the strategist again. She squeezed his arm, beaming.

No mention of Elara. Not even a vague nod. Not a shadow.

Her phone buzzed on the coffee table.

She didn’t pick it up.

She muted the TV instead.

The apartment felt too quiet without his voice filling it. Too empty. Her reflection stared back at her from the blackened screen, pale, tired, eyes rimmed with shadows she hadn’t bothered to hide.

“So that’s it,” she whispered.

A sharp laugh escaped her throat, surprising in the silence. It wasn’t funny. Not even close. But if she didn’t laugh, she might scream. Or cry. Or break something she couldn’t afford to replace.

Her stomach fluttered, gentler this time. A reminder. A tether.

Elara pressed her palm to her abdomen, grounding herself.

“I know,” she murmured. “I see it too.”

She pushed herself up and paced the small living room, bare feet sinking into the worn rug. Every corner of the apartment held memories now sharpened by absence. His jacket still hung by the door. His favorite mug sat untouched in the sink.

He hadn’t even bothered to come home last night.

Elara grabbed the remote and turned the TV back on.

Bad idea.

The strategist was speaking now, her voice bright and polished. “This campaign is about authenticity,” she said. “About showing voters who we really are.”

Elara scoffed. “Bold lie,” she muttered.

The camera zoomed in on her husband’s face as he listened, admiration clear. Elara felt something inside her finally give way.

The grief came first.

It hit her fast and deep, a wave she hadn’t braced for. Twelve years of shared nights and shared secrets. Of believing she was building something with him, not for him. She pressed a hand to her mouth as her throat tightened, eyes burning.

She let it happen.

For a minute.

She let herself mourn the version of her life that had never really existed.

Then the grief burned out.

What replaced it was quieter. Colder. Sharper.

Calculation.

Elara inhaled slowly, the way she did before walking into a crisis meeting. The way she did before making impossible things look effortless.

“Okay,” she said to the empty room. “Okay.”

She turned off the TV.

This time, she didn’t turn it back on.

The laptop sat closed on the dining table, exactly where she’d left it. Elara stared at it for a long moment before crossing the room and opening it.

The familiar hum steadied her.

She didn’t hesitate. Didn’t second-guess herself. She typed in a password she hadn’t used in months.

A folder opened.

Then another.

Files filled the screen, strategy docs, donor databases, messaging frameworks, opposition research, influence maps. Years of work. Her work. All neatly labeled. All backed up.

All still hers.

She scrolled slowly, a strange sense of calm settling over her. They hadn’t asked her to delete anything. The NDA hadn’t required that.

Funny, that.

Elara clicked on a document labeled Framework v1.3.

She remembered building it. Late nights. Red wine. Sticky notes plastered across the wall. She’d cracked the problem no one else could, how to map influence not by ideology, but by emotional pressure points.

She smiled faintly.

“You never did understand this part,” she murmured.

Her phone buzzed again.

This time, she looked.

HIM: You okay?

She stared at the message.

Then she laughed.

Out loud. Bitter and real.

She didn’t respond.

Instead, she opened a new document.

I love the water and will be sad if we don’t get any good snorkeling in elsewhere, but I also worry we’ll miss out on too much resort time. 3/7 days at the resort seems okay though, I hope? Also questioning the Muluk spa. We’re staying in Casa de la Paz, so I hope that really does mean we get an included hydrotherapy session. I just don’t know if it’s worth it to splurge on a couples massage there or do one at Xel-Ha since we’ll be there all day. 

Also if anyone has tips for absolutely must pack items that would be awesome. Currently shopping around for a waterproof fanny pack I can swim all day in without worry. Maybe something higher quality than the plastic ones on Amazon (unless they are actually reliable?) ",2,1769829893.0,Xcaret,2,1.0,False
1qrr6e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1qrr6e4/23_weeks_symptoms/,23 weeks symptoms?!?,"Yoo not to be TMI but I’ve had the shits today.  I’m normally a very constipated person and with proper nutrition I can manage it.  I’ve been more so on the (eat what I want) side of things instead of all the time eating healthy.  I’m not eating bad but I’ll have Starbucks breakfast here or there and fried pickles has been my shit recently lol.  I’ve only had fried pickles once this week… ok maybe twice but very spaced out… I’ve had more dairy than anything and I got to stop drinking the coffee cuz I’m getting acid reflux while even on the generic prescription of Pepcid.  

So I understand it may be diet and I may just be sensitive? So I’m going to try more bland foods with less grease.  But…. Has anyone had the shits around 23 weeks??? 

It’s so weird…my intestines will burn and I’ll feel like I’d have to go soon and then I’ll actually have to go.  But the stool isn’t watery enough to consider it diarrhea??

A large part of that feeling of being trapped is being burnt out on travel, and feeling like I’m missing my real life.

My anxiety has been through the roof although when I think about it, it probably isn’t as bad as it was when I was drinking 10 cups of coffee a day. I’m hoping my anxiety continues to improve but I more than likely need real therapy. ",3,1769829717.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1qrr26d,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qrr26d/unseen_exposure/,Unseen Exposure,"Max Burns is an amateur photographer. Though his profession is not photography, he does take photos as a hobby. On one of his days off, he received a call to take some photos of an abandoned house.

The person who requested this of him was a friend named Violet Moss.

She is a realtor who flips houses and resells them to make a profit. Max agreed and went to the address Violet had given him. Upon arrival, the house came into view. He had never seen something so unique.

It was a cliff-anchored house; this type of home is only seen sometimes due to the frequent landslides in the area. Pulling into a makeshift parking space, he parked his car, grabbed his gear, and walked up to the door.

A note was left on the door telling Max where the key was. At the bottom of the note, Violet apologized for not being there since she had to draw up the final paperwork. Retrieving the key from under a flower pot, he went inside.

Shutting the door behind him, he flipped the light switch for the lights that slowly blinked to life. Setting up his gear, he began to go through each room, taking photos. It was relatively empty and seemed odd to Max since Violet always decorated, especially if she would make a sale.

With the bottom floor done, he headed upstairs, cutting the lights on.

Stepping into the doorway of one of the bedrooms, he snapped a photo, and his camera began beeping at him. Confused, he looked at the screen flashing with the low battery symbol.

He sighed, took out another battery pack, and replaced it. The camera was fully charged, so why did it suddenly become drained? Shaking his head, Max continued finishing up the upstairs, then made his way back down.

Walking to the kitchen counter, he opened his laptop and inserted the memory card from his camera to review and edit the photos he had taken. Looking through the images, he came across the one he had taken of the first upstairs bedroom.

Inside the room, there was a figure. Static and grey, the person was about average height and thin, with their head hanging down. There was no way this was a ghost. Max didn't believe in the supernatural and blamed the camera for malfunctioning due to the drained battery. So he would retake the photo.

Max sent Violet an email with the photos he approved, and she quickly replied, asking him if he was still inside the house. He replied, telling her he was still inside the house finishing up. Violet, in a panic, told him to get out of there.

A creak from the stairs made him turn as he took out his phone and snapped a picture with its camera. Max cursed, forgetting his flash was on, and tried to take another when footsteps thumped across the floor towards him.

He dropped his phone and backed away from the island counter. What had made its way down to him? Max's phone began to ring, startling him. From where he stood, he could see Violet trying to call him.

Max cursed under his breath. ""Okay, Max, don't be such a baby. Ghosts are not real. Just grab your phone and answer it."" he said aloud to himself, taking a deep breath before grabbing his phone and quickly answering it.

""V-violet""

""Maxie, is everything okay? I'm on my way to your location. I need you to grab your stuff and go wait in your car."" she tells him, trying not to express the rising panic in her voice.

""Is something wrong with the house?"" Max asked, looking around and listening to his surroundings as he packed his stuff.

""Just trust me and get out."" She ended the call, and Max did as he was told. He put his bag over his shoulder, and his cell phone was the last thing he reached for. The lights in the room flickered before going out, ultimately leaving him in nothing but the darkness of the kitchen.

When Max let out an exhale of air, he could see his breath, making him visibly shiver. Keeping his eyes on the middle of the room, he walked backward, reaching his hand behind him to open the door. Once the door was open, he stepped out, almost tripping in the process, and shut the door.

Moving quickly, he went to his car, opened the door, and sat inside.

Max tossed his bag into the passenger seat and took out his phone to look at his photo of the stairs. What he looked at differed from the one he had taken from the bedroom. There was a man with no head, and his body was covered with something black. It dripped onto the floor, and the ax he carried was covered in dried blood.

Looking up from his phone, Max heard the house's front door open. He watched as it stayed open for a while until it slammed shut. Could the ghost not leave the house? If that was the case, Max was grateful. Violet parked next to him.

They sat in her car and talked briefly about what had just happened, and Max showed her the photos. ""This is just crazy,"" Violet paused and looked at Max. I'm so sorry this happened to you. I knew strange things were happening, but you got them on camera.""

""Didn't anyone else try taking photos or recordings??"" he questioned.

Violet shook her head. ""No, my crew was scared, so I looked into its history. Once I found out what happened, I looked for a buyer immediately. The person that I found deals with this sort of thing.""

Is there a person who deals with those things in there? Did Violet find an exorcist or a medium? Hopefully, that person is both.

""What exactly did you find out about this place?"" Max asked, putting his phone and laptop away. Violet gripped the steering wheel, looking over at him with a frown.

""That man in the photo killed his family in that house. His wife had been cheating on him, and he found out."" she began to explain.

Violet slowly took her hands off the wheel and placed them in her lap.

""He then hung himself above the stairs. When a family friend found them, he'd been hanging there so long that his head detached. His wife was practically decapitated upstairs. Thankfully, they didn't have children."" she added.

Max shuddered, thankful he had taken the pictures and got out of there when he did. He'd hate to think about what would have happened if he had stayed inside a little longer.

""You don't have any more houses like this, do you?"" Max asked nervously.

Violet shook her head. ""No, but if I do, I'll warn you first.""

""I'd appreciate that."" he sighs, leaning his head back against the seat and closing his eyes. This was enough excitement for one day. Hopefully, the person who bought this house knows what they're doing.

A week later, Violet contacted him.

""Hey Violet, did the new owners have any luck?"" Max asked as he headed inside from his regular nine-to-five job for the day.

""Yes, but I have another favor to ask,"" she replied, hearing two other people in the background.

""Oh...uh, sure. What do you need exactly?"" Max nervously swallowed, tossing his keys onto the dish on his coffee table.

""How do you feel about doing Spirit Photography?""

""As a profession?""

""The owner says they would pay you a lot.""

Max pondered this for a moment. If it paid enough, he could quit his office job, especially if this person bought homes like this often.

""Max Burns?"" a deep, gruff voice said on the phone now, making him sit upright. ""My name is Andy Graves, and I need your assistance with my business ventures. You'll be paid for your time and will constantly be on the move. Are you okay with these terms?""

Surprised, he visibly nodded, even if Andy couldn't see him. ""Yes.""

""Good. See you at the airport a few days from now. Monday six in the morning, don't be late."" Andy ended the call, and Max sat on his couch in shock. 'It this is a full-time profession now,' he thought.

Monday came sooner than expected, and he was rushing out the door. He looked at his apartment from over his shoulder before shutting the door one last time. He had already said his goodbyes to Violet the day before, so there would be no tears. When he arrived at the airport, he didn't know what to expect when looking for Andy Graves, but for some reason, he knew it was him when they met.

""Andy Graves?""

""You must be Max Burns.""

""It will be a pleasure working with you, Spirit Photographer.""

Max nodded, feeling a shiver go down his spine as they shook hands.

She has no manners of saying “hi” or “bye” or any basic human kindness. No conversation ever started unless I started it and she always talked about herself and never asked about me. At some point she started ignoring me fully, and since I didn’t start conversations anymore there were none. I asked her if we cannot ignore each other and speak normally, she said yes and still keeps ignoring me.

Her dog is the same as her- growls at me when she’s not home, but when she is he loves me so much. She did not raise him well if he feels so unsafe without her present at all times. So anyway I am tired of being ignored and unwelcome in my home, and even when she is not home and I finally have time for myself her dog is growling so I am always in fight or flight mode in this place.

Yesterday she had a friend over and when I was trying to sleep they kept talking and laughing loudly until 2/3am, I had to knock on the wall to ask her to quiet down, although she always demands discretion from me. I’m not even allowed to close the doors normally, I have to do it super quietly at all times! So yes my patience is boiling over, and since I am moving out tomorrow I just want to do some small petty revenge that wouldn’t be too visible but would make her wonder if something is off. Nothing harmful or illegal!! I don’t need paragraphs of how I need to move on, I know and I will, I just want genuine suggestions of small petty things I can do.

For example I already squeezed out some of her shampoo.

It was their turn to order and when it got to the tipping screen he just kind of laughs and goes “trying to get that extra money?” in a joking manner. Watched that man press the “no”  and had to watch the cashier/barista force a laugh  😭 

It is crazy that some people don’t even realize that most employees don’t have a choice over their company’s POS system, they do not put that tipping screen and they generally don’t care. You don’t have to make it a big deal if you don’t want to tip or make them feel bad for just working there.

For context, I live in the Northerns suburbs and I would usually take the 86 tram (which takes 12 minutes to walk to) plus a bus which takes 1.5hrs all up. But we hate buses, they’re unreliable, infrequent and just annoying to commute with. And as much as I love all the that the 86 has to offer, the constant stopping makes my morning coffee swirl inside me until I’m nauseas wreck. 

So, I’m willing to drive like 15 minutes to a station along the Hurstbridge line, like Ivanhoe to make me and the metro tunnel happen. Like I’m determined to make Metro Tunnel happen. However what ever I put into the PTV map or google maps, the routes I get recommended NEVER include the metro tunnel. No matter how much I tweak the settings. Instead it tells me to take a take a train and a bus. Or a train to Melbourne central and take a tram, or even WALK 20 minutes to my building. 

Then there’s the consideration — I would still have to drive super early to get a car park at a train station like Ivanhoe, and what’s the point if I don’t have classes until 10am some days? 

Is it just that the Metro Tunnel and I were never meant to be? It just seems like unless I have easy access to a train station where I don’t have to wake up at the crack of dawn to battle for a car park spot and that my destination is less than 5 minutes from Parkville station.
