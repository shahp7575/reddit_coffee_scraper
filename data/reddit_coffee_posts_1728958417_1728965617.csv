I visited Colombia (bogota, medellin, and cartagena) 3 years ago and absolutely fell in love with this country & limonada de coco has become my favourite drink ever since!

So I wanted to celebrate my birthday here this year, primarily bogota :) and since i'm traveling by myself this time, i wonder if anyone would to be interested in hanging out together? I would love to get to know more about the history and culture of this country and city! and food and soccer of course

I recently saw [eight shows](https://i.imgur.com/sjh1xhh.jpeg) in NYC and wanted to provide a brief review for each.  I’ll probably write up at least a few detailed reviews if there is interest.  Note that there are a few extra Playbills in the photo, since at some shows I was able to snag a few of the retro variants.

https://preview.redd.it/sz8bef0bhuud1.jpg?width=1868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d94ad2966b7f3abfc263892765cc2fc489bff625

# Rankings

Given the briefness of these reviews compared to the detailed ones I’ve previously written, I thought it may be helpful to provide tier rankings for context.

* **S** - Completely wowed me; would see again without hesitation
* **A** - Solid show and performances, one or both were above average
* **B** - Enjoyable show and performances, but perhaps lacking something
* **C** - Below average show; would not see again
* **D** - Fundamentally flawed show

# [The Roommate](https://playbill.com/production/the-roommate-broadway-booth-theatre-2024): A-tier

Given the cast, this show was a must see for me.  I think ranking this A-tier is a little generous, but the performances by Patti and Mia justify it.  I liked the set, props, lighting and sound designs.  The book by far was the weakest aspect (e.g., >!Sharon’s light switch flip from a seemingly timid mouse to purchasing an automatic rifle and wanting to be a drug kingpin was absurd at best!<).  Should you see this show?  If you like the cast, 100% yes.  If not, this is one that you could miss in favor of several better shows this season.

# [Oh, Mary!](https://playbill.com/production/oh-mary-broadway-lyceum-theatre-2024): S-tier

This was my second opportunity to see this amazing play.  This show is a must-see if this is your type of humor (lewd, witty, and often dry).  I love the tightly-chained vignette-style presentation and the >!cabaret-style closer!<, which tied the entire show together to perfection.  With the extension, I desperately hope to see this show a third time before it closes in January.

# [Forbidden Broadway: Merrily We Stole a Song](https://www.forbiddenbroadway.nyc/): C-tier

Did I generally have fun at this show? Yes.  However, I was disappointed with the low-effort staging and hit or miss performances.  For example, there is no excuse, even for a low budget off-Broadway show, for actors to regularly miss their marks and obviously stand halfway in the shadows.  With that said, Fred Barton (pianist and musical director) was incredible.  I spent a decent portion of the show just watching his mesmerizing performance.  Would I see this production again?  No.  Would I see a future production of Forbidden Broadway?  Yes.  It was a good time at a reasonable price, especially if you have seen the shows and know the Broadway stars they skewer with their humor.

# [Sunset Boulevard](https://playbill.com/production/sunset-boulevard-broadway-st-james-theatre-2024): B-tier

It seems my take will be contrary to the consensus on r/Broadway.  This show is truly a mixed bag for me.  The tech was incredible (e.g., interesting lighting design with essentially no color, unbelievable quality of live cinematography).  I am considering a detailed writeup on this show, just to talk about the tech because I enjoyed that part of the show so much.  Also, the orchestration and sound design brought the sizable orchestra and ALW’s score to life.  This was the richest sounding orchestra/score combination I have seen on Broadway in a while.

Now for the bad.  Sunset Boulevard deserves an extravagant set; this is a hill I am willing to die on.  Although, I did appreciate the show poking fun at itself for having no set >!when Norma first asked Joe to sit down, and he look around confused at the lack of seating before plopping down on the stage!<.  While [Nicole Scherzinger](https://playbill.com/person/nicole-scherzinger) has an incredible voice, her portrayal of Norma as a blatant psychopath failed to elicit any empathy for her situation.  I had no reaction when she >!murdered Joe, since it was already clear that she had no sense of right/wrong and just did whatever she felt like in the moment; I strongly believe the audience is intended to feel bad for Norma being discarded by Hollywood and be completely shocked by the violence!<.  Beyond this, I thought the product placement of the coffee mug merch at the start of Act 2 was incredibly tacky.  Also, Jamie Lloyd must have an ego that rivals ALW with the number of times he felt the need to show his name on the projection screen during the show.  On the night I attended there was one mid-show standing ovation.  It was not warranted, and it was clear that it was expected by Nicole and the crew.  Distasteful imo…

# [Yellow Face](https://playbill.com/production/yellow-face-broadway-todd-haimes-theatre-2024): A-tier

This is a well-written and thought-provoking play that also includes plenty of humor.  [Daniel Dae Kim](https://playbill.com/person/daniel-dae-kim-vault-0000127179) gave a great performance and was supported by a wonderful cast.  I particularly enjoyed the scene between Daniel and the unnamed reporter; >!the recurrent morphing of the power dynamic between the characters!< was an exquisite combination of writing and acting.  I would recommend seeing this show if you have the opportunity.

# [Our Town](https://playbill.com/production/our-town-broadway-ethel-barrymore-theatre-2024): C-tier

Unfortunately, I left the theatre quite disappointed with this show.  The set was decent, and I really liked the lanterns which hung above the stage and flowed in a curved arc out above the house (if I do an extended review, I will post a photo of this).  With the star power of the cast, I expected the show to be far more engrossing than it was.  I found Acts 1 and 2 to be bland and arduous, and I recall checking my watch at least 5 times.  Act 3 is where the show grabbed my attention, but it was not enough to save it for me.  The audience seating on stage didn’t seem to add anything to the show and just felt like a gimmick.  The worst part of the production may have been the costumes.  The story is set in the early 20th century, and while some of the costumes appeared period-appropriate, others included clearly modern shoes and other contemporary articles.  If this was an intended design of the show, I certainly didn’t get the purpose of it.  I’d recommend passing on this show unless you love the playwright or specific cast members are must-see for you.

# [McNeal](https://playbill.com/production/mcneal-broadway-vivian-beaumont-theater-2024): A-tier

I was very pleasantly surprised by this production.  After the negative posts I’ve read on r/Broadway and the recent lackluster shows at the Beaumont (i.e., Camelot and Uncle Vanya), I suppose my expectations were set low.  I liked all aspects of this show, from the set, to lighting and sound, the tasteful use of projection, as well as the performances of the cast.

I was downright giddy from the accurate portrayal of generative AI and large language models in a Broadway production.  As an example, prompt engineering and circumventing model guardrails were depicted impeccably when Jacob >!asked for the AI to write a suicide note and was immediately denied; he trivially overcame this limitation by asking the AI to instead write a note for a character in a book in the style of the writer Jacob McNeal!<.

A common criticism I recall reading was that the show lacked depth.  I believe the entire point of the show was that Jacob is a self-absorbed, shallow, insufferable a-hole, using current tech in an at best morally ambiguous way.  RDJ pulled this off perfectly.  Also, I particularly enjoyed the vagueness of whether >!a scene or even within a scene was real or an alcohol/medication-induced hallucination!<.  Overall, I think this may have been pushed into the S-tier had I been able to procure a reasonably priced ticket.  I won’t have the chance before it closes, but I would like to see this show again.

# [The Hills of California](https://playbill.com/production/the-hills-of-california-broadway-broadhurst-theatre-2024): S-tier

Wow is the one word I would use to describe this show.  It is a complete package in my opinion.  The writing was great, with some touches of cliché here and there.  The cast was incredible all around, especially the eight leads (i.e., the younger and older versions of the sisters).  The set was beautiful and dynamic, thanks to the help of a large turntable.  The lighting design was not flashy but perfect for the content.  The sound design and limited musical numbers were great.  I felt so connected to this show in the moment, and I still feel that when I recall the most impactful scenes.  This in my book describes the properties of an S-tier production.",0,1728965317.0,Broadway,0,0.5,False

All my HL gf preferred to sleep without a pyjama, cuddling/touch all through the night - I like that, too, and so the reason was obvious. Honestly, one does get a bit less sleep like that, but I consider that a fair price for that nice intimacy.

Laying beside LL, her in pyjama, not touching, I find quite annoying. Mostly because (1) she tends to snore a bit which easily wakes me up and then I must try to get her somehow turn etc., (2) because I have to be quiet if I wake up during the night, leave the lights off etc for not waking her up (otherwise I might read a bit etc).

The strange thing she still wants me to sleep in the same bed, not in an aggressive tone, but otherwise she calls me „boring“ etc. Of course I find our db boring, too… but from just laying beside her I am getting less sleep without drawing any positive feelings from that.

I just wondered if this is a common phenomenon in dbs? I guess I should have a „minor talk“ about our sleeping habits and move out in the guest room. Btw: even in a live bedroom I frequently moved out for the rest of the night, since I often get awake past midnight for an hour or so. But that’s a completely different thing, nothing negative at all - and coming back to her in the morning is (was. sigh) a particularly intimate moment. Including having some first coffee in the bed etc. An important part of my weekend routine.
With the LL, there is no such coming back moment; she just gets up to read newspaper in the living room.",1,1728965269.0,DeadBedrooms,0,1.0,False

Now I’m thinking of gifting a bedding set with new pillows etc. again, He is very simple and he doesn’t like spending $ on himself unless traveling but he will spend a fortune on me. He works hard and he also wakes up early. I really feel like he deserves an upgrade on his bedding so he can sleep comfortably. If I go with the bedding option, I plan to gift 2 nice pillows, organic cotton sheets/pillowcase set + comforter or a quilt. He isn’t gonna go out there and buy these things for himself because he is very simple. So I feel like I have a nice opportunity to gift him some fancy bedding.

**WIBTAH if I drop out of a friend’s wedding after not being invited to the bachelorette**

-------------------------------

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/4hy9c0i9q3): **October 2, 2024**

Hi! So I 25F am currently being pushed back and forth with my choice and I thought the lovely people of Reddit might be able to rein me in

i am currently 13 weeks pregnant and my friends around me have all been very happy and excited for me, however my childhood friend 25F, let’s call her Lisa. Stonewalled me since I announced at 8 weeks, I had assumed it was wedding stress but now I’m seconding guessing this.

In the weekend I was scrolling instagram and I came across a post where she had thanked everyone for coming to her bachelorette, photos of it’s the girls and her smiling in the middle and I sorta sat there shocked. At first I tried to be mature and just let it go… but this was a girl I grew up with, she was a bridesmaid in my wedding party and I’m a honorary bridesmaid for hers ( she’s not having a wedding party )

In the end I guess hormones took over and I ended up reaching out to her, at first I went “ oh looks like fun! “ and she replied that it was and after a tub of ice cream and a good sob I reached out and went “ hey, uh sorry to be this person but why wasn’t I invited? “

She immediately messaged me back with the response:

“Tbh the whole day was centred around drinking (wineries and heading to town after) and im not sure you would have enjoyed being around all of us drunk af especially cause your pregnant right now. I get that an invite would have been nice regardless, but in all honestly I just wanted to keep it very small. I’m really sorry you feel that way, but I don’t want to make this a big thing bc I’ve already had a shit week “

I tried to respond with hey thanks for getting back to me but I’m still upset cause the day is about you and I wanted to be there to celebrate you and then she rung me and just asked me to not make this a big thing once again and she sounded incredibly annoyed and like the door mat I am I dropped it

after thinking this over for the past few days I’m feeling very hurt and heartbroken, this was a girl I grew up with and loved and supported through a lot of shit, I’ve helped her plan and prepare a lot of her wedding so to suddenly get iced out like this I’m feeling a certain way.

my husband suggests we don’t go and I’m on the edge, so Reddit WIBTAH if I declined going to her wedding and distancing myself?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA with a few YTAs and ESHs**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I suppose whether you go or not depends on whether you enjoy weddings and whether you think you will enjoy being in the company of all those friends who went on the bachelorette party and never uttered a word about it to you.

> **OOP:** The issue is I’m considered one of her old friends, we grew up in a small town and moved to same city, we both took different paths in life. Both in jobs and social circles but I had always been invited to birthdays and events.. and while I might not be friends with her be group of friends they definitely know of me
> 
> But you make a good point, and something to consider

**Commenter 2:** NTA. Her saying “don’t make this a big thing” would piss me off. If you guys are close then she 100% should have at least invited you. The whole it’s my wedding and I can invite and do what I want is true, however that doesn’t mean you have no consequences for your decisions.

To me she doesn’t consider you as good of a friend as you may think.

**Commenter 3:** “I’m a honorary bridesmaid for hers ( she’s not having a wedding party )”

What the heck is this. is it a new fad I haven’t heard of or a way to get more partying and gifts from your friends without having them in the wedding ?

in any case WNBTA for ghosting her wedding. She deliberately did something that she knew would hurt your feelings and told you not to make a big thing out of it

&nbsp;

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/bD29mHCCMG) **October 2, 2024 (same day, 17 hours later)**

Hi! Hope this is allowed but you were all so wonderful and helpful and turns out I got an update sooner then I expected

so I haven’t heard from Lisa, that I expected

what I didn’t expect is a friend of Lisa to get in touch with me, let’s call her Sarah, I knew of Sarah and spoke to her a few times at events we attended together and she was one of the girls with myself went wedding dress shopping for Lisa, she was also a friend I noticed wasn’t at the bachelorette which was a surprise
anyway and at first she was doing a “ hey how are you “ and we did polite small talk blah blah until she finally went
“ so are you as pissed off and mad as I am at Lisa OP? “

Immediately I was slightly shocked as the few times I had met Sarah she was very I guess demure?

That opened the floodgates of information and she told me everything she knows, so what I didn’t put in the post is I actually waited 2 days before messaging Lisa about the lack of invite… turns out 3 of Lisa’s friends who also weren’t invited hit her up immediately after she posted on instagram asking why they weren’t invited

turns out these girls absolutely chewed Lisa alive and my “ confrontational “ was soft and finally it was revealed what actually happened and now I’m even more confused

so Lisa admitted to Sarah that her sister in law planned the bachelorette and just decided she was only going to invite the friends she knew.. so Lisa’s usual group of 8- 10 friends including me got narrowed down into 4 and Lisa decided not to correct her sister in law and just went with it, not realizing how many people she would be upsetting with not inviting people

apparently once people started attacking her she basically Lisa buried her head in sand and started making up lies to everyone on why they weren’t invited and using the same excuse of “ don’t make this a big deal “ until everyone realized the reasons were bullshit and called her out for it and the real truth came out

Sarah has informed me the girls who weren’t invited have all pulled out of the wedding, their partners included because they got the same annoyed response from Lisa before she told the truth and they all thought they didn’t deserve that… then she finally asked me what Lisa told me and I went deathly quiet on the phone before finally admitting she used my pregnancy as a excuse which then started poor Sarah on another rant of anger on how Lisa could say that to me! When I’m pregnant.. anyway we ended the call and she hoped we could get coffee sometime so I think I’ve made a friend?

so.. that’s the update.. this pregnant lady is very confused.. and I’m currently the number one buyer of ice cream at my local dairy LOL

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA she made it very clear that you and the group are not her friendship priority anymore. Perhaps her new SIL and her gang will be there to replace you guys. At least that is what she is making it seems.
Are her in laws paying for the majority of the wedding? Is she one of those pleasers that play along with the most annoying person so she can feel part of the group? You know she is in deep trouble, right? Her SIL must be some sort of single b each that likes to impose over others desire.
But the way, congrats on the baby. 13 weeks so so?

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/LGkB1pjbLS): **October 8, 2024**

Guys.. I want off this train 🤣

So minor and small update

so as mentioned in my previous post Lisa and I are childhood friends, and our mothers are friends.

I finally shared what had happened with my mum and first mum was so upset for me but also gave me an “ I told you so OP you are too much of a doormat ( thanks mum ) but she then said I have a big heart and sometimes people tend to use and abuse it ( ONCE AGAIN THANKS MUM ). “

anyway.. mum then gave more tea, more gossip
So apparently while Lisa has been telling people that she’s paying for her wedding out of her own pocket, turns out a big fat lie! Lisa’s mother had been sending her money and from what my mother told me it was a decent chunk of change, how do we know this? Well Lisa’s mum went to my mum upset because one thing I forgot to notice is Lisa’s mum wasn’t wasn’t invited to the bachelorette party

( context for people outside nz, we don’t have bridal parties so usually what people do is the older generation gets invited to like dinner and then the younger girls go out and party if you have a piss up, if you don’t have a piss up and just do a more chilled bachelorette then mum will be there the whole time, like mine )

So Lisa mother was distraught because she had been sending Lisa a decent amount of cash, had been told she wasn’t allowed to give her opinion about anything to do with the wedding and then wasn’t invited to her bachelorette.. and Lisa’s mother is honestly a nice lady so to hear that it kinda broke my heart and if I had known Lisa’s mother was sending money I would have told Lisa to pull her head in

my mum then had to break the news about why I wasn’t invite to the bachelorette and Lisa’s poor mother was mortified

So that’s the update.. is it even an update? I don’t know… I’m just very sad at this point cause I don’t know where my friend has gone? If she’s there anymore? Is this a bridezilla moment? I don’t know..

My ice cream journey though, I read everyone people have been loving this pregnancy ladies carving so allow me to indulge, recently I tried the Ben and Jerries banoffee flavor and it was very good, I wish the caramel swirl was mixed throughout all the ice cream but beggars can’t be choosers, and I had the most amazing strawberry sorbet the other day! Honestly so good I almost asked the ice cream shop for a tub of it but I had self control!

**Additional Information from OOP**

> **OOP:** I would like to acknowledge quickly in the comments that just because my friends mum was sending her money doesn’t make her mum entitled to change things about the wedding, but looking back on conversations I have had with Lisa I know for a fact her poor mum got absolutely stone walled when it came to offering suggestions..

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You know, I'm not sure I believe this story about how Lisa's SIL set the guest list. I think that might be a lie Lisa was telling to Sarah to try to excuse her actions. If that's the case, Lisa totally threw her SIL under the bus. Which... does SIL know that she's being partly blamed for this?

Kinda wonder if Lisa's mother would appreciate knowing that maybe she wasn't included because Lisa's SIL made all the decisions.

> **OOP:** I’m starting to realize that is most definitely the case, SIL has been thrown under the bus cause Lisa is realizing that people don’t take to kindly to being disrespected
> 
> as for Lisa’s mum knowing about Lisa’s excuse I don’t know.. I’ll talk to my mum and see what she thinks. For now I don’t want to overload the poor woman cause it’s a lot

**OOP explains what a piss up is**

> **OOP:** It’s kiwi slang for like a party where you would drink a lot of booze

---------------------------------------------

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/Q06pN42Bur): **May 10, 2024**

I (41M) have two kids with my ex wife, (42F) a son John(22) and daughter Sally (20), I'm remarried to my wife (28). I'm very close with my kids, my son is engaged to Abbie, she seems nice but has been a bit pushy trying to create relationships with me and my wife, though she's also awkward with her. Abbie isn't close to her family, she told us many stories why and while some of her complaints don't seem awful, it's not my place to judge and I didn't live it so I can't know anyway.

We've tried to be welcoming but Abbie has forced her way into some family traditions where she wouldn't have been invited, and some where no one outside of specific family would have. She has been calling Sally ""sis"" since they were only dating a few months, has an odd sister/mother-in-law thing she does with my wife, and the one I'm not a fan of, wants me to be like father to her. Not because we've clicked or anything. We are very different people, not saying that in a bad way, just saying it's not based on how we get along or anything.

My kids and I have a tradition when they come over that we have a private catch-up in my office/study before they leave, which is now even more important to them because while they both get along well with my wife they don't want to have personal conversations around her yet. Abbie asked if we could talk, and after I explained the tradition John later asked that I do it, saying she'd never had a caring conversation with her dad. 

We compromised that I didn't include her in the tradition but do join the two of them for coffee and let her talk. Then she started calling me dad, they werent even engaged yet, John pulled me aside and begged me to give her that, laid this whole thing on me about me always being the dad she always wanted right in front of her and she just wanted that, told me she cried watching me and Sally together (she still gives me random hugs, I'm a lucky dad). I didn't like it but I do feel bad so fine I gave her that. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and the father/daughter dance. I don't want to walk her down, and I walk with a cane so dancing is hard. At my own wedding I only danced twice. John is begging for me to do one, preferably the aisle.

They came over Sunday, John and I were talking, I thought to address it, when Ab walked in without knocking, asking if he'd told me yet. I asked what, John said she wanted me to say something about having a second daughter now in my speech and how I loved her. I just looked at him. She asked if I'd do the walk and dance for Sally, I said of course. She yelled she's my daughter too and I said it will never be the same, Sally is my actual daughter. I tried to explain I'd talk about her being a happy addition to the family and I love how happy she makes Jack, which i thought was a good compromise, but she started crying. John apologized and they left, but he called me when they were home nearly begging me to. AITA because I won't lie and say I love her or she's my daughter.

**VERDICT: NOT THE ASSHOLE**

**Relevant Comments**

**FuzzyMom2005:** NTA. You have your boundaries. Abbie sounds like she's developed this fantasy involving you and your family. That can't be healthy.

And yelling at you? ""You WILL tell people you love me! You WILL tell people I'm your second daughter! You WILL have a good time at my wedding!""

> **OOP:** OOP: John told me she really wants to be part of the family, but she started so quickly I wonder how much is us vs the idea of us. I've been told she immediately was obsessed with the relationship my kids and I have. The yelling...I was more concerned for John than upset, honestly. She seemed...not ok, right then.

**Commenter:** Yeah, this doesn’t sound like it’s about you or Sally as actual people. It’s about Abby’s fantasy of having a family. It makes me wonder how much she really even knows you or Sally.

There’s nothing wrong with her wanting a family, but she’s going about it wrong. Relationships grow and develop over time, you don’t just claim someone as family and have an instant relationship with them. She could definitely benefit from therapy.

> **OOP:** She knows Sally a bit now, with me she learns surface level things and approaches me, but when I try to engage she immediately acts like we're so close and switches subjects to something related to how much closer we should be. John says it's nerves but it doesn't seem like it.

**charmedphoenix39:** NTA. You have to keep correcting her. She pushed this far with the aisle/speech because you gave them an inch with the Dad, etc. You need to put your foot down with your son and her. If this continues, someone in the family will get fed up and might explode on them and it won’t be pretty. What if that confrontation comes at the wedding? This needs to be sorted now before the relationship and interactions continue. Otherwise you might need to consider lowering the amount of contact you have with your son and his wife.

> **OOP:** That's partly why I'm upset, I have tried compromising because I want to help my son but at some point understanding has to go both ways. I understand she wants family, and I know she's partly jealous because I like my daughter's girlfriend more, but we're in the same field and she let it happen naturally. I feel like it's all give and no take.

[UPDATE - AITA not walking her down the aisle or lying](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/cU032DTxqi): **June 26, 2024 (one month later)**

[AITA for not wanting to walk her down the aisle or lie in a speech? : r/AmItheAsshole (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cp1h69/aita_for_not_wanting_to_walk_her_down_the_aisle/)

I had planned on writing this sooner but life got in the way in a couple of really good ways, but people were helpful and asked for updates, and I have a surprise free day, so here it goes:

Mother's Day my kids and their partners go to visit my ex wife. So it turns out my ex wife and Abbie are a lot closer than I realized. She calls her mom, which is part of where this comes from. Also apparently my ex has been egging it on. On mother's day they were talking about the wedding and I guess whenever Abbie referred to me it was as dad. My son apparently told her let it go, which led to yelling. 

Abbie about deserving to be my daughter, ex telling her that she's right, son telling her that I am trying and she should be realistic about things, Sally telling her I only had one daughter - which was apparently a response to Abbie saying to her that as my ""daughters"" they should be united. according to my son Abbi was crying, according to Sally she was crying ang yelling and kicked something before going to her room, and Sally told me she went off on her mom, but will not elaborate so I don't know what was actually said. But knowing Sally - whoo boy.

Around 2am I got a text from Sally's partner's phone saying ""Abbie really is great, she hasn't been perfect but you should give her a chance and you will learn to love her."" I saw it when I woke up I tried to text her back but was blocked, so I called Sally but they were driving. They stopped by my place later that day because I am on the way and my daughter prefers my liquor and cooking and they told me about the night before. 

At the end I asked to speak to her partner alone, I asked if I had done something to upset her. She was confused and I told her I was blocked. She said I wasn't but checked her phone and I was, and I said it was after her message and she asked what message. I showed her, it was not on her phone anymore. At that point we brought in Sally and caught her up, neither of them were happy.

A couple of days later John and Abbie dropped by unannounced; not something we really do in this family but ok fine, I had mad salmon, does not take long to cook. I cook 2 more, wife serves while I make drinks. The entire night was Abbie trying to bring up the wedding, John trying to change the subject, Abbie not allowing that. 

We talk logistics because I am helping them get some good deals through some professional contacts I have when finally she just says ""so I was talking to mom, she said that you can walk me down the aisle and she'll do the dance, or you can dance and she'll walk, it's your call but you need to choose soon."" 

I reiterated that I could not dance (she tried arguing that I had danced a little at my wedding but I made it clear that is different) and did not feel comfortable walking her. She got upset and said ""mom loves me why can't you?"" I felt bad but couldn't lie, I pointed out that she had John who loved her, my exwife, friends, she had people who love her. She said ""but other than (ex-wife) those aren't my parents"" I said ""neither am I."" She was very emotional so my wife and I gave them a few minutes.

My son and I were alone later, he looked exhausted. He said the problem was that after Mother's day Abbie had called Sally and kept saying they are both my daughters, that I did not get to be close with one but not both, and that it was them against me - but at that one Sally cried havoc and let slip the dogs of war. Things were said. Grievances were aired. John had to hang up before it got worse, but I guess Abbie was shaken but there was a new problem; Abbie had decided in her head that I did not mean what I have been saying and was just doing it for Sally. He told me he would handle it.

Ron Howard: He did not

So now I get text messages from Abbie every couple of days acting like we have a secret relationship Sally doesn't know about, she even called herself my secret daughter and lol'ed. She invited my wife to lunch saying ""2 out of 3 of his girl's"" going out. She has even started using the pressure of showing up at events like a recent barbecue to play a certain image. She hugs me more and holds it, wants to do pictures with just me or my wife and I but always a few with just me to post with captions I do not like. 

My wife is getting especially annoyed because of how she is with her (I guess Abbie surprised her with father's day plans for me that had to be shut down, as it is she still inserted herself into the day) but she has a soft spot for her and when Abbie gets emotional she caves; my wife is a sweetheart.

I asked him if he is upset with me and he said no, he just wished it was different. He said we're good, but he's worried he and Sally aren't, which is when I took the advice of some people and suggested pre marital counseling, he said he would talk about it. Abbie is insisting Sally go to her fitting. 

That shop should pay-per-view that potential royal rumble because Sally is not holding her feelings back anymore. I told him Sally loves him and I'll talk to her, but for now it is stressful all around. Abbie driving my wife crazy with her ideas for what my ""girls"" should be doing, driving me crazy with dad-daughter content, drove sally to the edge, and oh yeah, last night sent me an email with 3 styles of father-daughter dances and song options, so i'm not feeling any more respected or heard than before. 

The six of us have barely been in the same room in order to let things calm down since father's day, which was great until it was a shit show. Sorry this is so long, with all the craziness this is still the abridged version. We are supposed to meet Friday, Sally's partner and I have a bet going about how bad it will go. So onward and upward, I hope you fathers had a less dramatic day than I did, and by any chance does anyone know exactly how bad of a crime I need to commit to enter witness protection? Just curious

**Relevant Comments**

**InstructionTop4805:** NTA. But Abbie needs serious mental health help. This is beyond a little needy to down right pathological. What's going to happen when she finally realizes she is not going to get her way? Someone's going to get hurt. Your daughter and her partner need to step back and not engage at all, and you and your wife should attempt to do the same.

Tell your son you love him and will do your best to support him, but until Abbie gets help you can not allow her to be around you and your wife. I wouldn't be surprised if Abbie has a history of this type of behavior with others in her past.

> **OOP:** I do not know her enough to know about her history, but this does worry me. Especially since my wife and I recently got some good news that has me feeling especially protective of her. My wife has a hard time with the idea of cutting contact since they get together occasionally, I pointed out she needs to take care of herself plus Abbie has my ex wife as a mother figure now, so she should be off the hook.

**ProfPlumDidIt:** I can't believe your son is dumb enough to still want to marry this walking red flag.

At this point you need to have a talk with your son, tell him that his fiancée is making you, your wife, and his sister extremely uncomfortable, and that you have serious concerns about her emotional stability because of her inability to accept boundaries and being told ""no.""

I would also tell him that, if she doesn't back off asap, you will make your boundaries physical and not attend events she's at or invite her to your events.

Personally, I'd tell my son I won't attend the wedding because I can't support him marrying someone so toxic but that my door is open to help him escape her once he's ready. I know not everyone could or would do that, but I would if it was one of my kids.

And witness protection is for witnesses of big crimes, not really those who commit them. You'd be better off just faking your death and running lol

> **OOP:** The shame is we used to sort of like her, my daughter, my wife, and myself. Early on she was interesting (diverse interests, she has travelled a lot for her age) she and I even have overlap in musical taste. The problem was when she decided she wanted this her personality changed and she started getting pushy, changing subjects to what she wanted if they were subjects she liked, it was like everything was put on hold until we acquiesced, which we haven't, so it has not gone on.
> 
> You make a good point about witness protection, plus I have been meaning to take up location tracker-free boating and scuba diving in sharky waters...

**Professional-Fact157:** Did you tell your son about the fake message from Sally's partner and the blocking? I don't know that you ever confirmed that Abbie did it, but that is another level of crazy from just inserting herself into your life.

> **OOP:** I do not think confirmation is possible, but her phone was where Abbie would have been able to get it according to Sally. Sally asked to be the one to tell him, this is crazy but with everything going on, job stuff (great news) family stuff (best news) wedding stuff (I try to watch my drinking!) and the family exploding a bit at father's day, I honestly forgot to ask her what happened. I have to call her later, it's funny until you sit down and write everything out you don't realize how much there is, it just feels like one thing after another.

**Agoraphobe961:** NTA. You mention in another comment your wife is pregnant, be prepared for Abbie to go into overdrive especially if it’s another girl. Her level of obsession is very concerning.

If you can’t convince your wife to step back now, give it about 5-6 months when Abbie has taken over the baby shower, picked out the nursery, posted the ultrasounds online, insists on being in the delivery room, and gives your wife a full belly grope every 3.8 minutes during visits. Revisit the conversation then.

> **OOP:** My daughter said the same thing about the baby coming. Your second paragraph sounds like hell, thankfully my wife has a close circle of friends for those things but I am sure you are right that Abbie will tryo to insert herself in our pregnancy journey like she did my father's day

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1furanj/update2_aita_not_walking_her_down_the_aisle_or/?share_id=RNO16GvRl4E5MGSTgXNa5&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1): **October 2, 2024 (3.5 months later)**

I have gotten requests for updates on my situation, and as I enjoy a refreshing mojito and my wife her nojito, life feels good and the perfect time to amuse the world with my pain and familial drama! Plus a cousin of mine who apparently reads these and knows my situation gave me the convincing argument of ""dude, you can't keep people hanging"" and how can I argue with that airtight argument. I apologize for how long this is, a lot has happened.

My wife's pregnancy is going well, keeping her as stress-free and pampered as possible has been my focus. It is such a different experience this time, both because of how much more involved I can be and how much better a relationship I have with my wife than I had with my ex. My daughter Sally has been great, even her partner has been great, helping with the nursery or driving her around when I can't. My wife doesn't know because it is a surprise, but my son has been building a crib for the baby, modeled after the one I built for him and his sister, to show my wife his support. My son is a good man, and he is still in there, he just has a soft spot for Abbie. Which I guess gets us to the part of the movie where Godzilla shows up and starts busting up buildings...

So I called a family meeting with my kids to talk about the situation. Told John his sister was only doing wedding activities she wanted to and that the guilting requests needed to stop, that this was hurting his relationship with his sister. Sally was happy I said it so she did not have to yet again. I told him if he did not stop her from messaging me I would block her with a bluntly honest explanation why. We got a lot out, John seemed to understand but then a few days later they insisted on coming to talk. Sally and I decided we would get everything out. 

So all of us ate at our place, Abbie started in immediately about baby shower stuff and I told that is the kind of thing we wanted to talk about. I told her that I understood she has been trying to fill a hole that she has, that she thought she was getting a father, a second mother (she calls my ex-wife mom apparently) and a sister. I told her it was still possible but that she needed to start listening to us. I told her that for the sake of family we would give her a fresh start, if she agreed that moving forward she would respect our boundaries. My daughter did not love this idea but loves her brother and was willing to try. 

Abbie tried to say that since we were starting over we could define what the relationship would be and just be family, we told her we were not ready for that, that it needs to happen organically. She got mad that I am closer with my daughter's partner, which is true but we just get along, and that she deserved it for trying so hard. My daughter said something about trying things we actually want. She ran to our bathroom, he ran after her. After a while I checked on him, I could hear her repeating ""this is not what I wanted."" My wife, daughter, and her partner went out to the patio to give them privacy and salvage the night, after a bit I got a text saying they had just left.

I checked in with him the next day and he said they talked more at home and she understood. For a couple of weeks things were good. The texts stopped except the occasional wedding question, since it was getting closer. She stopped pushing herself on my wife and Sally, and we thought was involving us in less in wedding planning out of respect, since as it was they only got the venue at the rate they did because of my professional connections and they know I was willing to help but not interested in helping plan, even if I am good at event-planning. 

But then I got a call from the venue telling me the card I used had been declined. Now this is a specific card I use for big purchases because of the miles so I knew it had a high limit. That was how I learned that they had changed dates by two months despite being informed I would still be out much of the money because it was too close to the date. I was furious, I mean I have been lucky in life financially but I am not blow-off deposits like nothing wealthy. Called my son, said he needed to get his ass to the house, just him. They both came.

When they arrived I opened the door, she actually started with, ""Dad!"" I think I just replied ""you have got to be f'n kidding me"" and walked toward the table. Abbie had the nerve to ask where dinner was, my response was not polite as I made it clear that was not why they were here. I hoped my son would not lie to me so I asked what was going on with the venue. She started going into wedding details but my son interrupted to tell me they postponed because my ex-wife was unavailable because of a surgery and he had not told me because he was putting money together to pay the lost money himself, and he had just reached out to guests to let them know. And that is when Abbie's mouth opened...""we have extra time to work on our dance...""

Now during this time my wife came home, and i was walking her toward the bedroom when Abbie said that. My pregnant wife with me I said, calmly, ""I have different feelings about that and will elaborate further shortly"" or something like that. Then I laid my wife down and got her water, turned on her symphonic covers of popular songs and walked back to the table and said something like ""You are out of your f'n mind have you even been listening?!"" I made it clear I was done with this nonsense, we all were, and kind of lost it asking she did not hear us last time because her head was up her ass. She was stunned silent (what a beautiful sound) and looked at me while I, admittedly with little filter, explained what Sally and I thought of our time with her and her attempts to force us to love her without even getting to know us. She started crying and stood up and shouted ""then what was this even for?!"" 

John asked what she meant, if she meant them and he started to freak out. She was frantic and said she meant delaying the wedding. Because, and I'm pouring another drink to write this, it was a ploy! My ex-wife and her decided if I HAD MORE TIME I would come around. Apparently my ex told her not to worry about the money because ""I am loaded."" She has always been bitter I make so much more than I did when we were married, as if that is out of spite rather than my career arc. I think she did that on purpose, frankly.

But she not only told me that lie, she and my ex told John as well. He was distraught. Repeating ""you lied to me"" as she tried to spin it but he was letting it out about how much he has defended her and covered for her and she lied to him too. She was defensive and blamed my ex for telling her things and me for being stubborn, she yelled ""why can't I just f'n call him dad"" and, finally, after so long, I heard John respond ""because he is not your f'n dad!"" She started crying and something about his being the one that told she could call me that and he said he told her she might be able to eventually but he had told her again and again to slow down. She started sobbing and went to sit on her chair but missed and fell on the floor. Appreciating physical humor to break the tension I admittedly chuckled and hid my mouth behind my drink, this all led to a lot of sobbing. I said I needed to check on my wife and as I walked out she was repeating ""I just want him to be my dad too.""

I came out and he was walking her to the door and apologized, I said not too, they left. He came over a few days later and said they had a long talk at home, he even asked her if she would have dated him if there was never a chance of being in the family. He believed her when she said yes but she admitted I was a big draw as well. I was the kind of dad she always wanted, my relationship with Sally is what she always wanted, and the way she said it gave John doubts that she loves him for him. I talked about marriage counseling, how his mother and I tried it and, while it did not save us, it provided clarity and an impartial voice. I pointed out they both like coming to me, but I cannot be impartial and if they are trying then they need to do it for real.

Abbie texted asking if I was the one who suggested therapy, I responded with ""does it matter if John wants to?"" She asked why it is so bad she wants to know what I think and I just said john is the man whose opinion should matter most to her. They fought due to the text, she agreed to the counseling and the wedding has been postponed!! I may have done a dance. So they are in counseling, he said she struggles but I obviously do not know details. She is pressing for me and Sally to go to a session with her, Sally told her she did not want to hear Sally unfiltered, and I am not interested. Abbie has been leaving Sally alone, she stopped texting me except for the occasional general question which include some attempt to go deeper. My wife still occasionally spends time with her because she is very into her pregnancy, more so than I like but it is my wife's call. So that is where we are, sorry it was so long but alcohol makes for a poor editor.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP on how Abbie is going to deal with the credit card she ran up**

> **OOP:** We have already talked payment plan, John insists he is not helping her and I believe it is mostly her but him kicking-in a little. Also I am making them scale back, she was unhappy but John actually told her she could not complain when she tried.

**OOP on his ex-wife causing lots of turmoil and using Abbie to get to him**

> **OOP:** I did not mention it because it already felt like I was writing a novel, but she has had big consequencs with my son, who is furious with her, and my daughter who apparently unloaded on her before mostly cutting her off. It's an entire update length in itself. My daughter pushed my ex-wife's face into a dessert. That's my girl!


**Commenter 1:** What's it going to take before your son wakes up and realizes that this is NOT the person he wants to spend the rest of his life with. She sounds unhinged. NTA. Updateme!
> 
> **OOP:** He seems to at least be looking at her more honestly now, I am hoping counseling helps him get there.
> 
>> **Commenter 2:** Actually, OP, the toxin in this whole mix is your fucking ex-wife. She has twisted and fucked with this girl from day one. I'd bet a bunch that but for the influence of that btch, all of you could have evolved into a nice family dynamic. Unfortunately the ct you divorced hasn't changed. Your son and daughter should shut her the fk down. She saw that poor girl's insensitivities and has exploited her. Send the venue tab to her attention. Wanton btch.
>> 
>>> **OOP:** After seeing the suggestion on here I texted him about 40 minutes ago that he should bill his mom. This is truly awful, she tried alienation when we split but has not done anything to this extent. John said in therapy they are discussing her influence, though understandably he did not get more detailed than that. My son is furious with his mom, I think he sees her more like Sally does now.

**Commenter 3:** Your wife is not helping the situation by letting her be part of this pregnancy. She’s leeching of that and will use that so be part of the family. I have no doubt she will see the child as a sibling and through that loophole see you as her dad. Sorry, but your wife is an idiot right now. Hope your son soon wakes up and leaves her crazy ass.

> **OOP:** I agree my wife should have cut her off at least during the pregnancy, she has at least started inviting a friend to go along so they are not usually alone. That alone sometimes gets Abbie to cancel. The sister thing is a concern I have as well.

What could be causing this?","I'm 23F, 167 cm/57 kg, sleep 6-7.5 hours per night on week days and 8-10 hours on weekends, work out 5x in a week, no known health issues

About 6 months ago I noticed I got a pretty heavy brain fog whenever I drank coffee or tea of any type. Before that, I drank coffee a few times per week on average from high school through university. I had been drinking tea since I was a child, and it never had an effect on me one way or another. I started drinking coffee daily when I graduated and got my job.

Now, any drink with coffee or tea in it gives me brain fog and a very fatigued feeling. It starts in a few minutes and lasts hours. If I drink more caffeine in that time period, I get jitters, nausea, and a headache. The weird thing is that energy drinks and pre workout powder still give me the desired effect (alert feeling, high level of concentration) without brain fog and other symptoms.

In my last health checkup, my doctor suggested me to stop drinking caffeine for 1-2 weeks and try again. I did that (and it was hell btw 😭) and nothing good changed, only the jitters, nausea and headache came from the start. And again, everything is fine when I drink energy drinks or pre workout powder. It also is not dehydration because I drink 2-3L of water in a day. 

I want to change back to coffee for my caffeine source, but it seems impossible because of my body's weird reaction to it. If any one knows what causes this or had a similar experience, please tell me!!",2,1728963634.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

My long-term partner (42 M) and I (30 F) have been trying to conceive for 6 months with no luck. 

I grew up southern Baptist/ evangelical with so much focus put on the value of a woman being what she brings to a marriage- honor your husband, cook, clean, raise babies… you get it. I grew up going to Christian school and going to church at least twice a week. I always struggled to stay quiet and demure. I always asked too many questions. Never intended to be disrespectful, but was labeled a bad influence pretty early on because I questioned authority. 

I lost my virginity when I was raped the summer after freshman year and I ended up “rebelling” and eventually having sex with my high school sweetheart. I felt that if it was going to be taken anyways no matter how much I fought, I wanted to control WHO. 

In college I drank and had more sex with my abusive college boyfriend and ended up becoming pregnant. I was ostracized from the church completely at that point. After having my daughter and raising her on my own for her first few months at 21 years old I wanted to go back to church so I found a larger church that didn’t know my background. I was incredibly lonely there without any kind of “community” connection and I signed up to start a small group for single parents. I was taken to coffee by the pastors wife and told I “wasn’t far enough out of my sin” to be a leader. I was humiliated. I left that church and never looked back. 

 Soon after that I met my partner and slowly over the last 10 years I’ve been deconstructing and rediscovering my own faith. As we have been actively trying to conceive the last 6 months I have struggled a lot with my shame and I can’t help but wrestle with the idea that this is a punishment for my sexual sin and not being chaste.

I stared at the cup of coffee growing cold in front of me, my mind spinning with the weight of what I had done. It was impossible to go back now. Everything had changed. 

Six months ago, I wouldn’t have imagined this. I was the epitome of control, a woman with a thriving career, a social life that kept me just distracted enough, and no time for anything deeper. My life was a series of meticulously planned decisions until a single choice—seeing Dr. Julian Hayes—sent it spiraling out of control.

I had come to him after a particularly bad breakup. I wasn’t heartbroken, but I was lost. It wasn’t about the end of the relationship; it was more that I couldn’t recognize myself anymore. And from the moment I sat in his office, I knew I had stepped into dangerous territory.

Dr. Hayes was nothing like I’d expected. In his early forties, with calm, intelligent eyes and a presence that immediately set me at ease, he seemed to radiate understanding. His voice was steady, soothing, and every time we talked, I felt myself unraveling, letting go of the carefully constructed walls I had built. He didn’t just listen—he challenged me, prodding at the darkest corners of my mind, encouraging me to confront the truths I had spent years avoiding.

The connection between us was undeniable. I felt it from the first session—his gaze held mine a little too long, his questions pierced a little too deep. It was subtle, though, and I told myself it was all in my head. He was my therapist. Nothing more.

But with each passing week, the line between patient and therapist blurred. At first, it was the way he looked at me during our sessions, as if he understood me more deeply than anyone ever had. Then it was the way he lingered when he walked me to the door, his fingers brushing mine for just a moment longer than necessary. 

I tried to push it out of my mind, convincing myself that it was nothing more than an attraction that would fade. But it didn’t. It only grew stronger, the tension between us building with each session, until it became almost unbearable.

The tipping point came one evening, after a particularly intense conversation. I had shared something deeply personal, something I had never told anyone. And instead of offering the usual detached advice, Dr. Hayes just sat there, watching me. His eyes held an emotion I couldn’t quite name—compassion, perhaps, but something more. 

“I don’t think we’re being entirely honest here,” he finally said, his voice softer than usual. “There’s something more going on, isn’t there?”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. My heart raced as I realized what he was implying. And before I could stop myself, I nodded, acknowledging the unspoken truth that had been hanging in the air for weeks.

That was when he crossed the room and stood in front of me, his presence overwhelming. I could feel the heat of his body, the gravity of the moment pulling me in. 

“I should walk away,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “But I can’t.”

I knew I should have said something. I knew I should have gotten up and left, that what was happening was a mistake. But instead, I stood frozen, waiting for him to make the next move. 

He lifted his hand slowly, brushing a stray lock of hair away from my face. The touch was gentle, tentative, as though he were giving me a chance to pull back. But I didn’t. Instead, I closed my eyes and leaned into his touch, the walls between us crumbling in that single moment.

And then, he kissed me. It was slow at first, tentative, as if testing the waters. But it quickly deepened, the weight of months of tension crashing down on us all at once. His hands gripped my shoulders, pulling me closer, and I felt myself give in to the moment, to the connection that had been building for so long.

I could have stopped it. I should have. But in that moment, I didn’t care about the rules, or the consequences. All I cared about was him—his touch, his closeness, the way he made me feel. For the first time in a long time, I felt alive.

The aftermath was a blur of emotions. We pulled away, breathless, both of us knowing we had crossed a line that could never be uncrossed. There was silence, heavy and thick, as the reality of what had just happened began to sink in.

“I’m sorry,” he finally whispered, his voice full of regret. “This shouldn’t have happened.”

I nodded, unable to speak. My mind was reeling, the weight of what we had done crashing over me in waves. I felt exposed, vulnerable, and more confused than ever.

As I left his office that night, I knew things would never be the same. I couldn’t go back to being just his patient, and yet, I wasn’t sure what we had become. All I knew was that the connection we had forged—the one that had started so innocently—had now become something far more dangerous. ",3,1728962990.0,stories,1,1.0,False

I feel like SUCH an idiot.

I was in Miami last week at a hotel, dodging Hurricane Milton. The rooms were insanely small, so I was spending most of my time in lobby area, the restaurant, and the pool. I am currently going through a very emotional and prolonged breakup (ex fiancee, selling house), so maybe I'm feeling more vulnerable then I had realized. I have picked up women in person before, and girls will sometimes come up to me and strike up a conversation. I'm a naturally confident and extroverted person. My ego killed me here.

I meet this attractive spanish lady at the pool bar. 90 minutes go by at the pool. We get flirtier as we get more drinks. At one point, she tells me she is staying in room 425. I was shocked, because it was a big hotel and I was staying in room 424. I couldn't believe my luck at the time.

After those 90 minutes, we left the pool and hooked up for a little bit in her room. She seemed to be loving it and my ego couldn't get enough. I told her I was taking her out to dinner and to be ready in 30 minutes.

I spent way too much and drank way too much at dinner. About 30 minutes in, I'm plastered and attempting to take her back to the hotel (both to hook up and because I know I'm too drunk). She says she is going to stay at the bar. I walk home extremely disappointed.

When I get back to the hotel. i realize that my credit card and ID aren't in my wallet. In a panic, I rush back to the bar and grab the id and wallet. Like an idiot, I whatsapp'd her telling her I was coming back briefly because I forgot my id and credit card there. I don't remember how it happened, but at the time, I didn't think much of it. Once I arrive again, the bartender hands me my card and ID. I don't see the spanish lady, and I go back to the hotel alone and fall asleep.

The next day, she texts me saying she wanted to hang out. After a pleasant day with spanish lady, I stay in her room that day/night and we end up sleeping together. I slept terribly in her room. I am normally a good sleeper, and since I had 1 beer, I didn't think anything would really affect my sleep. I didn't think much of it.

When she woke up, I was already awake on my phone. It all seems very casual and couple-y. We start kissing and I start making moves to have sex. She rejects me nicely and suggests waiting for coffee first. We don't get sexual again the rest of the trip/scam.

On day 3 I pay for a big date in the everglades. I spent several hundred dollars on this trip, but at the same time, she paid a several hundred as well.

We go to a bar that night and start having drinks. I get drunker then usual again. She suggests going to a club and her showing me how she dances like in Ibiza. I get entranced by this bullshit. Next thing you know, she suggests doing molly or ecstasy...

I'm not a drug user, but like a  fiend, I take this bait hook line and sinker. After my previous relationship, I found this girl so exciting and new.

We get the club, and I'm hating it. I hate clubs, I don't do this nightlife stuff. But for some effing reason, I decide to take the ecstasy as a way to stay awake.

The ecstasy definitely worked. I was on the dance floor all night inebriated but energetic.

This is where all of the bright red flags started appearing.

She begins giving me a cold shoulder after several hours of drug induced dancing.

I ask her again what could possibly be so upsetting. Feeling emotionally connected and drunk/high, I give her my phone to look through the text messages. She tells me I deleted them and to open my deleted folder. I do that, no girl texts. Then she says that I deleted them from the deleted folder... Then instagram...This is where I remember the scam comment from my parents.

We get back to her room, and she tells me she doesn't remember which girl the text was from, but she was disappointed in me. I did my best to act like I cared still, but I didn't really know what else to say.

About 5 minutes in the conversation, she tells me that she forgot her credit card at the club, and that she was freaking out because without it she wouldn't be able to check into the new hotel or get back to Spain. At this point, I know that this is a scam on top of a scam, but I tell her I'll go back to the club with her.

We get back to the club, and I begin to help her look for the credit card. I figured we had no chance of finding anything on the dance floor. 30 seconds later, spanish lady pops out and shows me a credit card that is cut down the middle, horizontally. I had never seen that before. She makes a point to show me that it has ""her name"" on it.

We get into the Uber back to the hotel and she gives me the standard scammer pitch that I knew was coming...

""omg oh nooooo i won't be able to check into my hotel and I won't make my flight to Spain tomorrow it's going to take weeks for a Turkish bank to send a new card.""

This is when we both knew the cat was out of the bag. I firmly said no to holding on to her personal property, and that she would need to hold onto her own card. She paused for a second, and realized the gig was up. She asks ""why are you acting strange like this? what is problem?"" I said there's no problem at all, but it's important for her to have her own card on her. Sheepishly, she attempts a weird ""joke"" saying that maybe I didn't want to hold the credit card because I was the one who chopped it at the club. Now she is really trying to plant some scam seeds. I calmly try to laugh it off, but I knew things were about to get messy.

We get back to the hotel, I begin to calmly pack my things and suggest I get the car. My goal here was to drive her to the new hotel, say I was going to go park my car, and then never come back.

I looked in my bag for my valuables. They were there. A macbook, 2 airpods, bose headphones, and some clothes. I was so confused at what exactly she was scamming me for...an expensive weekend together? Yes, I paid for way too much, but that was me being an idiot. At the same time, she paid for the hotel, that club night, and a couple of the meals we had. I couldn't figure out her angle.

What do you think her angle was? Was her angle purely just getting me to pay for her hotel and her flight at the very end? Or was it also for her to have access to my phone/airdrop/texts/instagram for more nefarious purposes?

**TL;DR:** I hung out with a scammer for 3.5 days. I spent lots of money on her, but she spent money on me too. We hooked up once, she never asked for money, and we kept hanging out like we were dating. What do you think her angle was? Was her angle purely just getting me to pay for her hotel and her flight at the very end? Or was it also for her to have access to my phone/airdrop/texts/instagram for more nefarious purposes?

1g3ykrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/deadmeatjames/comments/1g3ykrn/the_goriest_movie_of_the_year_is_not_terrifier_3/,THE GORIEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR (is not Terrifier 3),"2024 has been a great year for sicko cinema.

The Coffee Table, In A Violent Nature, and The Substance released with horrifying imagery that will be permanently grafted into my head for years. Lisa Frankenstein, Strange Darling, and I Saw the TV Glow instantly became absolute staples for many queer horror fans.

And of course, Terrifier 3 premiered number one at the box office this week. A world's first, showing that a gruesome, unrated, indie horror movie can beat a mediocre comic book blockbuster. And that's absolutely inspiring, but I want to spread the word for another movie.

**The Shadow Strays releases on Netflix October 17th**, and gore hounds should very much be paying attention to it. It's directed by Timo Tjahjanto (writer/director of V/H/S/94: The Subject and co-director of V/H/S/2: Safe Haven), and it is a spiritual successor/attempt to top the most violent movie I have ever seen; The Night Comes For Us.

If you watch the trailer it might not seem like much, but that's because it's intentionally obscuring the good shit. It will be a pure action movie like John Wick or The Raid, but every single kill will have slasher level gore effects; that's hundreds of gnarly kills. It premiered at TIFF earlier this month, and the crowd went absolutely wild for it. It brought the fucking house down.

It also has an insane sequel setup, so I'm selfishly begging you to please watch it on release day to convince the Netflix algorithm gods to let another one get made.",1,1728962760.0,deadmeatjames,1,1.0,False

I care for my mum and she’s having an extra hard time with a recent death of a relative she was close to and family drama coming from it. I’m doing the best I can to support her but it’s incredibly difficult because I’m in the middle of a depressive episode and in general I’m pretty emotionally unavailable. I’ve made it know to her and my brother that I am extremely depressed and I’m trying my best. My mum might have bpd or something of the sort and today she blew up on me. She went on and on about family drama, how she’s all alone, she’s an awful person who ruined our lives and she’s better off living alone. I was reassuring and trying to redirect her but no deescalation tactic was working. She kept twisting my words and wouldn’t let me elaborate on what I said. After us going back and forth for a few minutes, she brings up an extremely traumatic moment from years ago as a way to prove her point of us hating her and her ruining our lives. I tell her that we don’t hold that against her because she was under the influence and that we’ve moved on. She would not drop the topic and eventually it all got to me, I cracked. I broke down and yelled at her that I was a kid, I was just a kid. Of course I was angry with you and hated you. After more yelling she storms off and I tell my brother on that night she looked me dead in my eyes and said it was my fault. He and my older brother held her arm while I ran across the street to the police station in the pouring rain, barefoot and in shorts. She slit her wrist a week before my 17th birthday while drunk and high. My brother and I try to put this behind us, for the most part we have, but our mum brings it up every time she’s having this kind of freak out. She uses it as an example of her ruining our lives and us hating her. She also uses it as a way to show how everyone leaves her and she’s all alone. 

Since she’s insistent on believing that she’s better off alone and that I don’t love or care about her, I’m not going to do anything for her tomorrow. I’m going to put my phone on mute and ignore her if she calls for my help out of bed. I’m going to let her make her own coffee, grab her own meds, change her own clothes etc. I’m going to go out tomorrow and take time for myself and gather my thoughts. She would greatly benefit from a group home setting but refuses it, maybe she’ll be open to it from learning the hard way she can’t live/be alone. ",1,1728962524.0,CaregiverSupport,2,1.0,False
1g3yho5,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g3yho5/looking_for_some_small_advice/,Looking for some small advice,"Hey Reddit. I went on a very long (20km roundtrip) hike yesterday. At a fork in the road, I was wondering whether I should continue another 5.5 kilometers to reach one of the main summits (would have hiked back in darkness), or to just visit this  turquoise blue lake nearby and head back in day light.

While I was staring at the map at the fork, many people were hiking back to the parking lot, and I chatted briefly with many of them. I ended up chatting to this very kind, pretty girl for around half an hour. Before she hiked back down to the parking lot I asked her for her number and got it!

I would appreciate your guy's advice in how to proceed from here. She lives an hour away from me. Should I ask her to go on an easier hike? Get coffee? Drinks? Any wisdom would be appreciated:)

Death and I sit at a table

I pour him a cup of coffee

And his mesmerizing eyes enchant me

His nauseating smell both appeals and revolts

His hands are folded, he meets my gaze

My grip slips and bitter dark liquid stains the table

“I’d come with you” I say

“If I were able”

The dark wooden surface absorbs the light

And half of me longs for life

But all I see is Death

His promises catch my breath

And give it back again

Offering to whisk me away before life can ask me where I’ve been

Death slides towards me a paper and pen

And I sign my name

Making a pact I’m not sure I can enact

My name on the bottom line says I’ll give my life to death

Should there be too much pain

He promises to take me easily

That I will fall into his arms nearly seamlessly

A love story, my first and last

Death be my future and void be my past

 

“Coffee with Death” Rewritten

Death and I sit at a table

Eye to eye I meet his gaze

He slides towards me a paper and pen – I slide it back to him

“I am unwilling,” I say, “not unable

You promise a pact you won’t enact

You give your word but will take it back again”  
He picks up the pot of coffee,

His grip slips on the sugar cubes, leaving white powder smears

On his black knee length jacket

The spoon clatters on the floor but I act as if I didn’t hear

I turn my back on death without remorse or doubt or fear

And walk out the door of that café to meet the friends and loved ones I hold dear

“Goodbye for now,” I hear him say

1g3yd4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1g3yd4r/hand_grinder_particle_distribution/,(Hand) grinder particle distribution,"Hey all,
   I was doom-scrolling through coffee-net recently (as you do), and came upon a few recent handgrinder videos (K6 v Zp6, Tier Lists, K6 v K-Ultra etc). While watching these, a thought/question came to my mind. 

Are there any publicly available/curated spreadsheets that keep track of particle size distribution (median size, variance) at each grind setting across the range of popular/common hand grinders? By this I mean for eg, the 1zpressos, Timemore C-series, KinGrinder K-series etc.

Most of us home-brewers don't have access to particle-size analysers of course but any pro who does would be doing a great service for the community if we can put this together.

Having said all this, there are pros and cons.

Cons:

1. Particle distributions can have a wide band distribution around the same median/mean size
2. Grind profile presumably would vary across roast levels
3. Grind profile would also vary on grind speed and/or tilt (slow feed)

Pro (Only one I could think of):

1. It would be a good starting point to dialing in your pourovers when you have a different grinder for the same coffee or the same grinder for different coffees. Even help with pushing extraction for those whole like that.

I know we should be dialing in pour-overs by taste, but this might end up saving good beans from the arbitrary starting point of trial and error.

I mulled upon this for quite a few days before posting this on here to see what everyone thought. It might be too much effort for too little gain but then again, we might only need to do it once. Maybe someone might help!",2,1728962064.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

1g3yb11,https://i.redd.it/ssa1hxfc7uud1.jpeg,Collection opinions/Recommendations? ,"As a 17M broke college student, this sub has been really useful in finding affordable alternatives to overpriced scented alcohol. Below, I give my thoughts on my current fragrances/decants, but would love some recommendations too. My favorite notes are almond, vanilla, and fruity notes. I despise oud, moss, and overly ""masculine"" green/woody scents. I also love gourmand scents. I like anything male-leaning to feminine, just not overly masculine wood/green/moss scents.

Lattafa Ramz Silver/Afnan 9PM (JPG Ultramale) - I group these two together because they smell almost identical to my nose. A beautiful powdery vanilla scent that is a 10/10 in my books. This is my daily. Never smelled the OG

Lattafa Ishq al Shuyukh Silver (1 Million Lucky) - A warm nutty/vanilla fragrance with a pineapple note. Can be worn year-round, and is another 10/10. I like Ramz Silver more tho. Never smelled the OG

Lattafa Khamrah (Similar to Killian's Angel's Share) - A super dense and rich vanilla/cinnamon/caramel scent. It's so dense, it reminds me of syrup. 9/10

Versace Pour Homme - A citrus bomb with some florals. Great summer scent, I just wish it lasted longer. My go-to for the hottest of summer days. 9/10

Lattafa Khamrah Qawah - Khamrah but with a coffee note. Reminds me of a dimly lit coffee shop. 9/10

Lattafa Vintage Radio (Initio Paragon) - A warm woody scent with berries. It's nice, but I prefer the others. 8/10

Lattafa Ansaam Silver (Azzaro The Most Wanted) - A spicy, aromatic, and sweet vanilla fragrance. Something about the aromatic/vanilla combination throws me off though. 7/10

Lattafa Fakhar Extrait (1 Million Parfum) - I don't really know how to explain this one?? It smells sweet and like cashmere, that's all I got. 6.5/10

Afnan Supremacy In Heaven (Creed SMW) - Compared to the original, this one is more harsh and has a lot more woods. Bought it after smelling SMW, but it didn't live up to the OG. Should've gone with CDN Sillage. 6/10

Lattafa Bade'e Al Oud Honor & Glory - Does NOT smell like pineapple creme brulee. It does for about 15 seconds, then fades to a spicy warm pineapple scent. 5/10

Lattafa Blue Oud - Came free with decants, smells like a bit of fruit with oud. I hate oud. 3/10

Lattafa Bade'e Al Oud Sublime (Kayali Eden Juicy Apple) - Smells like fruity goodness with lychee and apple for all of 10 seconds, then turns into a spicy moss/patchouli scent. I hate this so much, because it tempts me with the fruity heaven everyone talks about, then turns into a moss fragrance. 1.5/10

Rasasi Daarej pour Homme (Valentino V pour Homme) - smells like straight plastic to me. 0/10

Fragrances I want to pick up next: 9PM, Lattafa Eclaire, Rasasi Hawas Ice, CDN Iconic

It is inevitable, considering similar worldwide myths and stories of indigenous people. For them it's even something normal.

If the western population would be aware of this, it would dismantle the very foundation of many cultures (religion) and dismantle institutions which are the base of many countries who currently dominate the world (USA, UK, EU countries). Religion is also the main weapon they use to keep their neo-colonies in constant control, these are the countries they get wealth with their resources and cheap labor.

Now, how is this related to the Immaculate Constellation?

If you are aware of the potential dangers of this information getting out, you would do anything, and I mean anything, to keep it hidden. But how? Someday surely someone will leak something, either intentionally or by accident. Normal citizens will find something strange, or something will happen, which the government has no control or even an idea of what it is and specially how to explain it to their population.

It is no coincidence that UFOs have been appearing suddenly in the media around the time governments all over the world have started creating floating devices of massive destruction. It's also no coincidence that the main people who have ""leaked"" governmental information were somehow a part of it, and are allowed to not only freely speak, but also have media coverage, not major, but just enough to make the rumour propagate to the right ears.

The plan goes as follows,

1. Hide the evidence from the faithful and the unfaithful

Keep it in the Vatican hidden vault. Create worldwide operating institutions who dictate what is true and what isn't, automatically risking the career and reputation of any researcher, scientist or journalist.

2. Make the theory seem totally! crazy and specially anyone who believes it, but make it fun:

Hollywood, the largest governmental media propaganda, is allowed to constantly create movies, shows, documentaries about the very legitimate creatures with stunning accuracy, as we now see with the Peru mummies. If you claim the alien from the E.T. movie is real, who is going to believe you?

3. The final step, make your enemies work for you:

All the fake promises of their agents, keeping the believers humiliated and the non-believers laughing at the silly news with their morning coffee is not enough to put an end to the discourse.

What helps the is to do the contrary of what you want. Leak real pictures, videos, let your weaklings swear under oath, let seniors confirm its real, only to completely dismantle it in the most catastrophical way. Humiliate and sacrifice all of them, prove that they are working for other governments, mentally unwell, the project is actually real, but meant to analyse terrorist weapons.

1g3xzkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1g3xzkt/mariner_of_the_seas_galveston_930_to_105/,Mariner of the Seas Galveston 9/30 to 10/5,"I am claustrophobic and have never been interested in a cruise, but I saw a video of a very particular corner Panoramic Suite 1864 on Deck 12 that was added during amplification in 2018 at the very front of the ship and I booked it 18 months in advance.  We paid about $2600 total with gratuities which I think was an excellent price for four people x 5 nights.


My husband and I travelled with out 2 daughters (10 & 16) and this room was simply amazing.  It has 5 panels of panoramic window and is extra spacious due to its location.  The only other similar room is on the opposite side on the same deck, but that one is handicap accessible.  We had overnight storms a couple of nights and we could see the rain and lightning for miles.  The sunrise in the morning was beautiful on the 2nd day.


My son booked himself a spacious ocean view room on deck 9 that was much more dated, but still very comfortable with a large porthole window.  I do want to point out that our bathroom was very tight with the toilet placed very close to the sink.  My son’s room had the same configuration, but more space between the toilet and sink.  Four people in the room was a small challenge, but we were close to the public bathrooms on deck 12 and we used them often and never ran into a single person.  Public bathrooms were very deluxe and spacious.  The shower had excellent pressure and hot water 24/7.


We did not get the  Beverage Package, but I did have 1 or 2 drinks each evening.  The Coffee Card was a good deal and I did get many coffees on Deck 5 where I got great service.  The one coffee that I ordered at the Wind Jammer one morning was not hot at all.  It was very convenient to take the elevator straight down to 5 since the Café is right next to those elevators.


We opted for early dining and ate dinner at the MDR 3 times.  Service was great and food was good to great every time.  We also had breakfast in the MDR twice and Lunch once.  I do prefer the breakfast in the MDR since it’s more relaxed and not crowded like the buffet.  The Windjammer was packed and busy with many options.  The Indian eggplant dish I had one night was amazing.


Soft serve ice cream on deck 11 was okay, it always seemed to be on the verge of melting and they only had vanilla and chocolate.  Got one plain hot dog at the Dog House and was disappointed, the texture, temperature and taste was not good at all.  We also visited the Café every evening for 2nd dinner after the shows and ate and embarrassing and unnecessary amount of pizza.  Sandwiches and desserts were very good there too.


We followed the recommendation to book lunch at a specialty restaurant on embarkation day and had lunch at Jamie’s.  The food was good, but service was a bit chaotic and we were feeling the first symptoms of motion sickness, otherwise I would do it again since the Windjammer was a total nightmare when we walked through it.


The highlight of our trip was Chef’s table on day 5.  We sent the girls to the buffet for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed a grown-up dinner with our son.  All the food was truly excellent, but especially the Roasted Branzino and Filet Mignon.  I am allergic to Walnuts and Pecans and there were several dishes where the chef prepared a modified plate for me with basil oil instead of pesto or a brownie instead of another chocolate item that contained walnut.  All the wine pairings were delicious and it was a unique experienced that we all enjoyed.


Our 10-year-old did attend Adventure Ocean a few times but was not impressed.  I think it was because there weren’t many children on board her age and the two groups were combined due to numbers.  I’m sure it is hard to come up with activities that appeal to kids from age 5 to 12.  16yo did meet some girls at the teen club and they did hang out most evenings.


After dinner, we spent a lot of time in the Star Lounge where they hosted live music and games.  It was comfortable and not inappropriate for kids.   We did pay for Bingo one day, but I don’t think it was worth $80 for 4 of us to play.  It was a single game and you had to black out your card, so it did drag on a little.


I had booked our excursions very early when prices were low.  Our first stop was at Costa Maya where our excursion was cancelled at the last minute.  We were supposed to do a Beach Break with Snorkeling and Open Bar but were forced to pick something new from very few options because not all options were appropriate for a 10yo, or did not have space for 5.  I selected the Town Highlights & Beach Break with a free tequila tasting.  Since it was last minute, it was double what I paid for the original excursion ($97 per person), but I was told on the voice mail and the paper flyer on our door to request a discount that evening.


I will be very honest and tell you that the town of Mahahual is very sad and dirty and in no way ready for prime time.  The excursion was a total scam.  First, you are held captive for nearly an hour at a sad parking lot where they offer you a taste of tequila and then give you a hard sell.  Honestly, it isn’t even good tequila.  Then they take you to a very rustic beach (Blue Kay) with no amenities or pool where you can lose 2 hours at a mediocre beach.  Not at all what I expected for nearly $500.


The port of Costa Maya is a tourist trap, but at least you can get off the boat for free and wander around.  If I ever go back there, I would not book an excursion.  Do your research, find a beach that is recommended and take a taxi there.  Save hundreds of dollars.


When we got back to the ship, I went to customer service to complain (wasn’t the only one complaining either) and was given back a whopping $10 per person because the original excursion cancellation was caused by weather (snorkeling visibility was low).  I was hoping they would at least let me have the excursion for the price that I had paid originally.


Second stop was at Cozumel where I had booked the Reef Explorer Semi-sub.  That was the best part of the trip.  The excursion is run by a conservation organization, the boat is in perfect condition, visibility was perfect (suck that Costa Maya), and the tour guide was excellent.  Had a wonderful time.  We then took a taxi ($20 for 5 people) to the main part of town to walk around the markets.  I have travelled in Mexico and Central America, so I expected prices to be better, but prices were quite high.  Do not be caught unawares.  Bring more cash.  We ate lunch and took a taxi back to the port.  Could have made it back to the ship pretty fast but fell into the Duty-Free shop and had some retail therapy.  Got some excellent Tequila and a few bottles of vanilla and honey.


Later that night, as I was lying in bed, I awoke with a start because I couldn’t remember where I had put the vanilla and honey.  I know I turned the booze in when I got back on ship, but the vanilla was not in our room.  Next morning I went down to customer service, and don’t you know they had my bag?!  I must have left it on the table when I turned in the booze and they send it up to lost and found.  Many thanks and good vibes to whomever found my lost bag.


Lastly, my 16yo had a sudden need for some feminine hygiene products on day 4 and I went a little mad asking strangers and checking public restrooms for a dispenser (shop wasn’t open yet and we had an early excursion).  Customer service rescued me with a couple of free units to tide me over until we could buy some in Cozumel.


I recommend that you wait until your last day to do any shopping on the ship.   Prices will keep dropping and I hit the T-Shirt Sale and got 2 shirts for $30, as well as a Make-a-Wish shirt for $25 that benefits the charity.  My husband also got a watch the last day when they were about 75% off.


The whole trip, we were watching a low-pressure system in the Gulf that eventually turned into Milton.  The water was a little rough on the way out (day 2) and very rough on the way back (day 5).  The ship seemed to be rushing back on Friday as the storm worsened and moved East.  We made it to Galveston before 6am on Saturday, which I think is earlier than normal.


If you are not from the Houston area and will be here for a cruise anyway, then I totally recommend that you make time to visit NASA/Space Center Houston.  You need to purchase your tickets in advance if you want to snag a visit to the old mission control.  The tram tour to the training center is not a big deal, but the best part is the tram tour to the Saturn 5 rocket.  It is truly impressive to behold.  Budget some $$$ for the gift shop.  I would stay an extra day just for that.  It is VERY crowded on the weekend, so go on a weekday if possible.

1g3xy0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g3xy0k/aita_for_considering_breaking_up_with_my/,AITA For considering breaking up with my boyfriend if he doesn’t get me a boo basket.,"Throw away account because my bf has Reddit. I (20 F) and my bf (20 M) let’s call him John, have been together 2+ years now. We met on a really lame dating app where you swipe to meet friends and add each other on Snapchat back in May of 2022 during our final few months as seniors in high school. At the time I was living in New Mexico and he lived in Texas so I didn’t take it too seriously. After only a couple days into getting to know each other over various snaps we started FaceTiming each other every night to go to bed. This went on for a couple of months up until August of 2022 when I finally took the initiative of driving 10 hours to DFW and finally meet him and his family for the first time. We had a cabin rented in Oklahoma for the next couples of days that was originally a trip planned with his friends but turned into a retreat for just the two of us, during this trip he very quickly asked me to be his gf and I hesitated but said yes. 

Fast forward a couple of months go by, we see each other a couple of times in NM, and finally it’s around November of 2022, I’m still living in NM and going to college and he’s started traveling for work at his first job. I had finally gotten tired of my food service job and college wasn’t going how I planned so I called his mom in the middle of a breakdown and she invited me to come live with them while I get on my feet out in Texas. I was hesitant at first and talked to him about the offer she gave me and eventually I took it. On New Year’s Eve of 2022 I moved myself over to the DFW area into his families home while he was away for work at his job for a couple of more weeks and started quickly looking for a part time job. During February of 2023 we were celebrating Valentine’s Day together when I noticed he was texting a girl from the same app we met on, I looked through the texts and didn’t see much of anything except this girl trying to flirt with him and him giving very short answers back, but still I was hurt and had a breakdown in front of him about it. After an hour or so of talking about things I quickly realized it wasn’t anything to worry about and we continued on just as normal as we did before. After 3 months of living in Texas I finally started working at a coffee shop March of 2023 and met a couple of good peers there who became close friends of mine and I would talk to them about how my relationship was going. By this time John had already gone back to another job site and was gone for about a couple of weeks after I started the job. He sent me a snap one day and it was a note a woman left on his truck asking for his number and he admitted that he texted her and even asked her how old she was. After a long interrogation he swears he only texted her to tell her that she meant to put the note on his coworkers truck because he found out she was in her 30’s and his older coworker was staying at the same hotel with an identical work truck. All of my coworkers thought it was suspicious and motivated me to get the screenshots of the messages from him and when I did it ended up that he was telling the truth. After this I had carried some guilt in not trusting him for a while but I would still talk to my favorite coworker about everything that happened during our relationship and she swore he still wasn’t a good guy to me and that I was love struck because it was my first relationship and it was his as well. 

By fall of 2023 I was getting closer with this coworker and she made me realize that he wasn’t asking me on dates, he was refusing to get me flowers because “they just die anyways”, he wasn’t making any kind of future plans or commitments to me, he was constantly canceling our plans to hang out with his friends instead. I had quickly started apartment hunting around this time due to his parents thinking the state was going to take down their house to expand a highway, he had no sort of initiative to move out with me and I instead I had to find a last minute roommate to help me pay bills. He quite literally had no interest in moving out of his parents house until his mid 20’s. By the spring time of this year he had stopped working his traveling job and decided to take off working at all for a long period of time, and nothing had changed with him and our relationship so I was on the fence about wanting to stay with him or not, but still saw a potential future with him. I had just come back from visiting NM for Easter when I had him over at my apartment, I started getting sharp pains in my chest and he rushed me to the hospital. This happened twice in a couple of days span due to the hospital mis-diagnosing me the first time. The second time I was admitted into a room and had to stay in the hospital for 6 days with a horrible case of pneumonia. During this entire time I saw his fear of losing me wash over his face in the ER when he realized I couldn’t breathe and nurses were rushing to get me oxygen, he was shaking in fear I could tell he was having a hard time staying calm and it broke my heart to see him like that. He stayed in that room with me for every second of those 6 days and only left to use the bathroom or shower. After the hospital he had me stay with him at his house for a week before I started my new job and took care of me to the best of his abilities. This really won me over because I got to see how much he truly cared for me and was afraid of losing me. 

A week or two later life went back to normal and I started working a new job shortly after that in April of this year. Now that it is fall of 2024 I’ve come to notice that he has gone back to his normal treatment as he was doing before I got sick, no dates, no flowers, canceling on me for his friends, he started a new job in August that is an hour commute from my apartment but only a 45 minute commute from his house and due to this and being on a different work schedule as my 9-5 bank job, his schedule requiring him to have a random week day off, and working Saturdays, he refuses to stay at my apartment with me because “the commute is too long”. Mind you this is the same guy I moved 10 hours to be closer to. Now due to this, the only time we spend together is when I go to his house on Saturday nights and stay until Monday morning and then straight head to work. He never wants to make plans with me because “he’s tired from working and just wants to stay home” but if his friends are in town he has no issue making dinner plans with them or going over to their houses and either spending the night or staying out until 3-4am no matter what day of the week it is. 

Recently I received a text from my dad in our family group chat that due to his random health scares (he had a random stroke in his eye this summer) doctors have found that some of his arteries in his neck are blocked and he’s experiencing random blood clotting and that he’s in need of a cancer screening. The thought of my dad possibly having cancer has taken over my thoughts and has been a hard thing to come to terms with and I’ve been emotional for a few weeks now just thinking about it. However it’s changed my perspective drastically on whether or not i truly to stay in Texas near john and pursue a career in real estate, or if I should move back to New Mexico and take care of my dad if he does happen to be sick. I told John about how I was feeling and I was considering the option of going back home to take care of my dad and his first comment was “what about me” and I was shocked that was truly the only thing that came to his mind when I told him the news of my father possibly having cancer. Now I have  been back on the fence about whether or not he’s a good boyfriend or just doing the bare minimum and I’ve come to realize he’s really just doing the bare minimum. Now that it’s October and my lease is almost up with my roommate I’ve decided that I wanted to get my own apartment a long time ago, john has continued to voice that he has no interest in moving out together until he’s At least 25 or so, my future is starting to look more and more unpredictable about where I’ll be living and what I’ll be doing with my life. So finally a week ago before I had a planned to leave and visit my dad in New Mexico I decided to mention twice to John while I was at his house before I left that I wanted to do boo baskets for Halloween this year, he seemed to acknowledge what I said but didn’t seem to take me seriously, and after that and a few other comments he’s made over the past couple of weeks I decided this is going to be my final test to see if he truly cares about what my interests are or if he’s just keeping me around as his accessory rather then someone he would do anything for. 

PS during my trip to NM this week I’ve learned my family doesn’t seem to like him after finding out he refuses to live with me, had not planned on getting me a birthday gift until I mentioned to him that I wanted one, and still lets his mother baby him by always doing his laundry, cleaning his room and bathroom (which he’s never in his life had to clean before) She even changes his sheets for him, but she has made me do all of these chores for him when I lived at their house and even makes me do all of these things to this day if I as much stay more than one night at their house even though he’s home to do these things himself.",0,1728960729.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

I write in 3rd person, past tense can easily put out a few paragraphs!  I don't have a length requirement, as long as there's effort put in and the story gets moves forward! 

OC’s only & I prefer more realistic faceclaims / descriptions, but I'm not too picky. I prefer at least 2 'main characters' per person, with a reoccurring side character or two that can get more 'screen time' if we like them! I like plotting as we go to keep the story interesting! If you really only want to play one MC that's not a deal breaker, as long as you're still helping to carry the story! 

I am a queer nonbinary guy myself, and I lean towards masculine/nonbinary characters & queer pairings, but I genuinely care most about the chemistry between the characters! I also love exploring polyamorus dynamics, but I do *not* like any characters cheating. 

I'm also 33, so I'd prefer partners be 25+, but 21+ is a requirement! 

I do like including nsfw elements in the roleplay *eventually* - if the characters have chemistry & we have been writing together long enough to be comfortable with that. I do not want it to be instant or the focus of the rp! 

Now onto the fun stuff!! 


**Modern settings / plot ideas** my main craving right now is centered around a horse ranch - I could also be convinced to do a post-apocalyptic setting on a ranch, but this would need a lot of collaborative plotting! We can also add some of the following elements or keep them separate:

Small town with the classic troupe of childhood friends / sweethearts where one moved away and one stayed. Can include the one who moved getting famous and falling from fame or moving back for PR reasons.  

Single parents  / exs / coparents

Something centered around a coffee shop - could be paired with a local or new to town musician who starts performing there or just a new hire or regular. 


**Medieval fantasy plots**  - my go to for this is usually some kind of arranged marriage - it's an overused troupe, but it's a good excuse to get the characters together and there's  always tons of drama built in! 

My ideas are mostly centered around two OCs of mine, who can be played together or separately. One is a younger (30ish) royal type who is the 'odd one out' in his family (they could even be evil / the eventual bad guys) and more of a sarcastic, 'shitkicker' type, and the other character would be his older guard (45+) who is very loyal amd almost a good guy to a fault and wouldn't act on feelings if he had them. I think it could be fun to pair them with a royal woman & her guard / maid, and then play around with pairings. I'm also down to play the guard separately as the one who is engaged for whatever reason! 


 I also write over Discord - I'll send that out after we chat a little! Feel free to send me a message or chat request if you're interested! Let me know what plots / ideas you liked and please add your own!! Collaborating and plotting together are really important to keeping the story going! ",1,1728960659.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

It is inevitable, considering similar worldwide myths and stories of indigenous people. For them it's even something normal.

If the western population would be aware of this, it would dismantle the very foundation of many cultures (religion) and dismantle institutions which are the base of many countries who currently dominate the world (USA, UK, EU countries). Religion is also the main weapon they use to keep their neo-colonies in constant control, these are the countries they get wealth with their resources and cheap labor.

Now, how is this related to the Immaculate Constellation?

If you are aware of the potential dangers of this information getting out, you would do anything, and I mean anything, to keep it hidden. But how? Someday surely someone will leak something, either intentionally or by accident. Normal citizens will find something strange, or something will happen, which the government has no control or even an idea of what it is and specially how to explain it to their population.

It is no coincidence that UFOs have been appearing suddenly in the media around the time governments all over the world have started creating floating devices of massive destruction. It's also no coincidence that the main people who have ""leaked"" governmental information were somehow a part of it, and are allowed to not only freely speak, but also have media coverage, not major, but just enough to make the rumour propagate to the right ears.

The plan goes as follows,

1. Hide the evidence from the faithful and the unfaithful

Keep it in the Vatican hidden vault. Create worldwide operating institutions who dictate what is true and what isn't, automatically risking the career and reputation of any researcher, scientist or journalist.

2. Make the theory seem totally! crazy and specially anyone who believes it, but make it fun:

Hollywood, the largest governmental media propaganda, is allowed to constantly create movies, shows, documentaries about the very legitimate creatures with stunning accuracy, as we now see with the Peru mummies. If you claim the alien from the E.T. movie is real, who is going to believe you?

3. The final step, make your enemies work for you:

All the fake promises of their agents, keeping the believers humiliated and the non-believers laughing at the silly news with their morning coffee is not enough to put an end to the discourse.

What helps the is to do the contrary of what you want. Leak real pictures, videos, let your weaklings swear under oath, let seniors confirm its real, only to completely dismantle it in the most catastrophical way. Humiliate and sacrifice all of them, prove that they are working for other governments, mentally unwell, the project is actually real, but meant to analyse terrorist weapons.

After all the theories are covered, destroy all of them. One by one. This is what happening right now. And they do not need any of their paid internet users to do it for them, we are all doing it by talking and spreading the inevitable fall of the biggest high in the UFO community has ever had.",0,1728960500.0,UFOs,1,0.4,False

I have no energy. So much has happened. For a little background, from 15-19 years old I lived in a house with domestic abuse and drug use. My step dad would abuse my mom and my mom would take it out on me. For those 4 years my dog was the only stability I had. I moved for college and found out my step dad had been recording me sleeping and showering for all 4 years I lived there. My mom helped him. I won’t go into the whole issue but we don’t have enough evidence even though we know it was for sure them. I tried getting my siblings out but I legally couldn’t take them. I moved away for my own mental health. I now have an open investigation against them and a custody battle for the kids. My dog passed a few weeks ago. I have a puppy as well but the bond isn’t the same she doesn’t understand me more than a normal house pet. 

My dog declined hard for the last few months. Her hearing and vision went, she was incontinent, and just didn’t enjoy life at the end so it was time. It was hard and my mental health is lower than it’s been in years. I have had no time for anything. And no energy to fix it. My life right now consists of working, taking care of the dog, and going bed, then doing it all again. Me and my boyfriend have no money. My mental health is horrible. I drink more than I used to, dishes and laundry are piling up, my dog’s two crates are still sitting on the porch ready to be cleaned as she soiled them the day she passed. Her blankets and her leash lay on the floor right where she last stood in our apartment. Just as she left them. It’s been almost a month. I cry every day. Multiple times a day. I have panic attacks and my need for a psychiatric service dog has become more apparent than it already was.

We can no longer get walk through our own home. I refuse to let my boyfriend move my dog’s things. Or touch them. They smell like her. They smell like home. I have a pretrial for the custody hearing on Friday and I don’t know what to do. I’m not fit to do this anymore. I can barely brush my teeth and shower daily. I have cavities. I’ve never had a cavity before now. I don’t remember the last time I ate. I live on coffee and alcohol. My boyfriend is getting tired of the way I act. I need help. But I can’t afford the help I need. Im afraid I’ll lose my boyfriend. I don’t want to be alone. If he leaves I don’t think I’ll make it much longer by myself.",1,1728960435.0,venting,1,1.0,False

Is it a red flag that a woman demands a weeknight date, or should I just expect to wine and dine women on second dates?",1,1728960303.0,dating_advice,8,0.67,False

Sorry this is a long post. 

We're coworkers, and things had been going well—he's consistently made plans with me (outside of the bedroom like nice dinners, coffee dates etc), including a recent day trip to go hiking. We've both expressed that we like each other, and he’s been open about his feelings. The sex is also incredible for both of us. I also haven’t noticed any red flags and he seemed to have self awareness. We haven’t had the exclusive talk but frankly I hadn’t felt ready anyway because I recently got out of a long term relationship. 

This week, we have a heart to heart and he mentions that he’s stressed because he wants to keep seeing me but it’s a lot for him with everything else going on in his life (I won’t get into it but his job requires a lot out of him and he doesn’t get home until 9pm on most weeknights) so he asked if I’m okay only seeing each other on weekends during his busy work season if us dating were to continue down the line. I told him that’s fine, I’m not in a rush to hangout all the time anyway & I have my own life too. We agreed to that and then planned our day trip for the weekend. 

However, the night before the trip, he slept over and we played a game where we asked each other deep questions, and after I asked him to elaborate on some of his answers, the mood shifted. He seemed annoyed and when we fell asleep, he didn’t cuddle me like he normally did. I tried not to overthink it but the tension carried into our car ride the next morning. 

In the car, he opens up that he felt I challenged him on every question in the game and how I seemed off the entire night. So, because of that, he shut down. I told him that I had a long day but it wasn’t my intention at all to be hard on him about his answers. He told me he doesn’t expect things to be perfect but that it threw him off. I apologized and said how I appreciated him being honest with me. We continued the day, went on our hike and it was great. Everything felt back to normal—he was affectionate, we were laughing again, etc. 

Then we had lunch and he again brought up doubts about our relationship, saying he was stressed with work (which I do believe because he’s getting home at 9pm most days), that he is worried because we’re different in a lot of ways, and unsure about what this would look like going forward. I heard his concern, but told him that honestly it seemed like he wasn't that into me (and that that’s okay!), but you make time for the people you care about and I’m not sure what’s the point of continuing this with his doubts, but he just kept saying he needed time to figure things out. (And to be clear, I have made it clear to him several times that I like him so it’s not like he thinks this is one sided). 

He then asked how I was feeling, and I said ""sad,"" to which he replied, ""sad or devastated?"" In my head, I’m like, ""do you expect me to cry over you?"" He’s rejecting me in another country—I’ll cry when I get home. Anyway, the conversation didn’t reach a conclusion and we started the drive back. 

While driving, he began taking deep breaths, touching his face, and his eyes were red. It literally looked like a panic attack, but he claimed he was just tired. We stopped at a rest stop, and he eventually seemed better, and when we resumed, he apologized for dampening the afternoon. Then he said, “maybe I just need a couple of days or weeks to get my shit together.” I suggested he should date other people (trying to give him an out to end things) but he insisted he didn’t want to and that it’s a life decision of whether to continue this with me, and if he’s going to be with someone it would be me. I told him it’s up to him to figure that out but it’s not on me and I’m not waiting around for him. And he understood. Then, he had the nerve to ask if I wanted him to drop me off or stay over again. I said uh no! 

I thought we were over, but his comments on the drive back confused me. 

Now, two days later, we haven't spoken and I don’t plan on reaching out. I’m left wondering what caused this sudden shift in mood and having doubts (because he seriously was so into me through words and actions even a day before that) and if he’s truly interested in me or just confused about what he wants. He does deal with anxiety and depression, but I'm unsure if that's a factor here.

My husband’s birthday was just a few days ago. I wanted to take him out to dinner and he said he just wanted a lowkey birthday at home, so I respected his wishes. We have been married for 3 years and together for 7. We have two children 2 and 3 years old. In the past years I’ve always tried my best to make him feel special on his birthday. Baking his favorite cake, made his favorite meals, did a surprise bday celebration one year, have decorated the house, and got him presents. His parents and siblings Don’t do anything for his birthday and always act like it’s any other day. His own dad forgot his bday this year and I had to call him to remind him. 

For this birthday, I got his favorite coffee and donuts when he woke up. Had baked two apple pies per his request the night before with my sister after working a full work day and taking care of my kids (he works nights and isn’t home till 9:30-10) I Had balloons downstairs and his presents from me and the kids waiting to be ready when he walked downstairs.  Everything was going well the morning of his birthday. We got home that afternoon and I stared to get a really bad headache. I’m under a lot of pressure and get headaches often. I’m the main caretaker of my children, home, and I work full time in a very difficult and demanding job. My husband tries to help, but always uses his commute and work as an excuse. Anyways, he asked me what was wrong and I told him my head was hurting badly. He was so upset and said “wow, even on my birthday I have to deal with your bullshit” threw a tantrum, then everything went downhill from there. 

My 3 year old wasn’t listening during lunch so my husband took him up to his room slammed the door shut, and started yelling at him and I ran up there to rescue my son and told my husband not to ever yell at him like that. I was already in semi tears bc of his response to my headache and then my husband told me in front of my 3 year old “I hate you, yelled and said I want a divorce” then things escalated very badly. I didn’t care it was his birthday anymore and I was so overwhelmed with sadness so I left. A few hours pass by and I tell my husband let’s just have pizza and pretend for the kids since they were so excited to sing happy birthday etc. He then proceeds to tell me this is the worst day of his life & he’s the saddest he’s ever been in his life and that I left to punish him & I didn’t make him feel special. At this point his birthday doesn’t even matter since he said all those terrible things to me. 

My birthday is coming up in 2 weeks and I just don’t want to do anything with him at all. I promised myself to focus on my health for this birth year and stop putting my energy into him since he doesn’t give me the energy I feel I deserve. How can I communicate to him the reasoning behind why  I don’t want to spend my birthday with him this year? ",19,1728959619.0,relationship_advice,20,0.88,False

I don’t shy away from colors so I’m open to any suggestions tho I’m trying to stay away from more pink but I’m not completely closed to idea. I really want a cute boho living room that’s got an ambient vibe to it, very urban outfitters/Pinterest/anthropologie vibe.

I know a lot of achieving that look will involve getting more plants but I’m just focusing on pieces right now like a rug and coffee table.  Love textures, like velvets and furry. 
I’d say a 8x10 rug or 9x11 would fit my space well, am working with a little bit of a budget so it definitely makes it a little harder looking for bigger size area rug :(

Whenever Windows does its ""background update"" process, everything slows down, and my computer seems starved for resources. Particularly, one specific resource - memory. From what I can tell, the rest of my build might be slightly outdated, but nothing that would bog down an OS this badly. The only thing I could think would be causing the problem, is if the old HDD isn't cutting it anymore.

So, I'm shopping around for an SSD. This is what I'm looking for. I need a drive that will:

1. Be reliable enough that I don't have to worry about it going out on me
2. (Hopefully) resolve my bottlenecking issue
3. Meet my storage needs (hoping for 1 TB space minimum)
4. Cost $100 or less

Pretty much in that order. But, if what I'm looking for just doesn't exist at that price point, I'll weigh my options on cost versus storage capacity. Points 1 and 2 are non-negotiable. I'm looking for a SATA drive that fits in the 3.5"" bay on my case. I'm not sure if my case supports other form factors, but if it does, I'd be open to giving one a try.

1g3xhxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1g3xhxy/postop_update_day_5/,Post-Op Update: Day 5,"
I started experiencing mild gallbladder symptoms last year. It rarely bothered me, but I consistently felt a slight pressure, like a thumb pressing where my gallbladder is located. In February 2024, after an ultrasound, I was diagnosed with multiple gallstones. Three different doctors recommended that I have my gallbladder removed. Despite this, I didn’t feel that my symptoms were severe enough to justify surgery. I’d heard stories of painful gallbladder attacks, which made me consider the surgery, but I kept thinking I could manage this discomfort without going under. I also worried about the possibility of an attack happening while I was away, like on vacation.

I made appointments with a surgeon three times, only to postpone them each time for various reasons. My last scheduled appointment was October 9th. On October 7th, I was thinking of canceling again, fully intending to call the doctor’s office the next day and reschedule.

But then, around 3 PM on October 7th, I experienced the worst pain of my life. It was indescribable—just horrible—even though I’d been careful with my diet. I ended up in the ER, and after receiving morphine and other painkillers, I finally felt some relief. By the time I left the hospital, it was the morning of October 8th, just a day before my scheduled surgery. At that point, I knew for sure: I wasn’t going to postpone it this time.

The surgery went ahead the next day. I experienced mild discomfort and about 4/10 pain for the first two days, but by day five, the pain had decreased to 2/10. I had my first bowel movement and was still dealing with gas and occasional shoulder pain, but overall, I’m glad the gallbladder is out. I was even able to drive to a coffee shop alone and grab a cup of coffee.

I didn’t experience any nausea or vomiting after the surgery, just some pain that was manageable.

Feel free to ask me any questions!

I was expecting to have more guidance going into it, at least some SOPs but there are none. I feel completely lost. I have no defined tasks, I have to make it up as I go, and I have a student worker under me. 

My boss is clearly very overwhelmed and we have a very small team. She sends me various articles and things on 3 different platforms and I’m having a hard time keeping it all straight. 

Like today — I had to give a presentation to another department with my team and my boss wasn’t there on Friday to help me or my colleague prepare (I had no idea she would be out). And I also needed to edit a video of the UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT (which is a huge deal) but I didn’t have time to because I suddenly had to prepare for this presentation. 

I am already inundated with emails from people needing me to do XY and Z for their department. I feel like I have no time to just focus on a single task and end up chasing my tail or doing too much research and getting nothing done. And then I have to find work for my student worker to do on top of it all. 

I’ve been setting up coffee chats with my counterparts in other departments which are helpful but also difficult because they have bigger teams and bigger budgets for more sophisticated scheduling tools and apps. 

I don’t know what my priorities are and I feel like I’m failing. I don’t have a concrete set of tasks and I’m learning lots of new platforms and discovered today, I’ve been using one completely wrong and have like 10 overdue tasks. 

I’m drowning and I don’t know what to do! I want to be good at this job but I feel massively underqualified and unprepared. Until now, I have been micromanaged in every job I’ve ever had and now, it feels like I don’t have enough management. 

How do I set up a system to keep myself on track?

**What is ""Jason Hale - 2 Trades A Day""?**

""Jason Hale - 2 Trades A Day"" is a day trading course that teaches you how to trade emini futures in a simple, efficient way. The system promises you can make profits by placing just two trades each day within the first 90 minutes of the market opening. The best part? It’s designed to help you wrap up your trading before 11:00 a.m. EST, leaving you free for the rest of the day. Jason Hale, the course creator, guarantees that if you don’t make back the course fee ($495) in 20 consecutive trading days, you’ll get a refund.

**Who is Jason Hale?**

Jason Hale is the man behind this system. He's been a part-time day trader since 2005 while still working a regular full-time job that he loves. Unlike many trading “gurus,” Hale isn’t a millionaire or some trading wizard. Instead, he’s a regular guy who struggled with traditional investing and eventually found success in trading emini futures. His journey from learning the ropes of trading to refining a strategy that works for him is a big part of why this course feels approachable.

**Where does ""2 Trades A Day"" fit in?**

The strategy revolves around trading emini Dow futures, focusing on price action without relying on complicated indicators or fancy software. Hale’s experience watching these charts daily gave him insight into certain market patterns that he claims consistently repeat themselves. By following these patterns, he has built a 70%-80% profitable system.

This method appeals to traders who want to keep things simple: just two trades per day, a rule-based system, and no need to stay glued to your screen all day. You can even use any trading platform, so there's flexibility in how you trade.

**When can you expect results?**

Hale suggests that you’ll likely start seeing results within the first 20 days of trading, given the 70%-80% profitability rate. He emphasizes that the system is built for the mornings, meaning you’re done trading by 11:00 a.m. EST (or earlier) most days. So, if you're someone who doesn’t want to be stuck at your computer all day but still wants to profit, this is designed for you.

**Why choose this course?**

Why choose ""Jason Hale - 2 Trades A Day""? Because it’s about simplicity and results. If you’re tired of overly complex trading strategies, this course breaks things down into a simple, manageable system. Plus, Hale has gone through the same struggles most beginner traders face—blowing money on educational resources that don’t pan out. With his method, the goal is to pocket a consistent profit daily without spending all day watching charts.

Also, the course fee is $495, which Hale claims you can earn back in one day if you’re trading multiple contracts. With no recurring fees or special software requirements, it’s a one-time investment, and you’re free to trade with whatever tools you prefer.

**How does it work?**

It works by following Hale’s rule-based system, which he honed over years of trial and error. The course comes with a concise e-manual and 10 instructional videos (plus live trading examples) to walk you through the process. You won’t need any fancy indicators—just pure price action. Once you recognize the patterns Hale teaches, you’ll enter and exit trades within minutes, all before most people have had their second cup of coffee.

**Final Thoughts**

""Jason Hale - 2 Trades A Day"" is a straightforward course for anyone who wants to simplify their trading. If you’re looking for a low-risk, repeatable system that gets you in and out of the market fast, this could be a great fit. It’s not about making millions overnight—it’s about slowly building consistent profits. If you’re a beginner or someone who’s tired of complicated trading strategies, Hale’s system might be worth a shot.",1,1728958754.0,ZaneStudying,1,1.0,False

I'm unsure if this is appropriate because it's not in their office, and it feels a bit more casual in that way. Is the houndstooth crazy or classic? like the beret but could always take it off inside too.

1g3x96r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g3x96r,Beloved Spider ,"Hi all- 

I am your typical spider scared, yet made a friend the start of summer.

She’s my beloved yellow banana / garden spider- in TX named willow. 

I’ve watched her for about 4 months now- shes moved webs a few times in the perimeter of the window. Beyond bug ethics (have thrown her a few live ones) - sprayed her web during the hot days - and gotten closer than I ever thought I would to a spider. 

After studying the life cycles and having a close eye- she hasn’t really been in a spot to be found by a mate and hasn’t left her web the whole mating season - I’ve kept my eye out for tiny males but haven’t seen them come through. But, I got worried for a day when I came for for my typical morning coffee, smoke and gaze at her and she was gone for less than a day- then back to her web like clock work. 

I see eggs semi next to her in web hidden by the roof (I shooed off the lizard, also do they eat eggs?) 

Its still 90 degrees here in oct. - she should live technically till the frost, and even after the babies if those are her eggs? 

Yet she looks so lethargic….
  I havent seen her eat, legs are shriveled, she looks so tiny compared to her usual, beautiful, glistening and bright self :( is she dying? How do ya’ll cope and try to give them a happy life and help protect the eggs for her?

my chapter went through the typical ""big little dates"" process where actives reach out to PNM's/non-initiated girls to go on dates to see if we are compatible. We were supposed to go on THREE DATES. the first girl that contacted me and took me to a coffee shop did not connect or care about me at all. I was literally in the middle of telling her a story and she picks up her phone and goes on snapchat. I just stopped talking completely and about 45 seconds goes by just SILENT. so awkward and I wanted to cry. I was not contacted again by another girl so I just went on ONE date when I was supposed to go on THREE. What im trying to say is that I feel like I missed out being able to gauge compatibility with older girls. I had to put random names down on the ""big little preference"" google form because no one else contacted me. I got in touch with the New Member Experience Officer to tell her the situation but it was just too late since big/little reveal is on a schedule. 

Fast forward to big/little basket I just didn't feel known or seen. Idc about materialistic things but I told her my T shirt size on our ""big/little basket wants"" and she got me an XS for both of my shirts in my baskets. It just didn't feel good but I was trying to have a positive attitude. She made me a big lil instagram which was super funny and nice. 

  
Then big lil reveal happens. Everyone is screaming and crying and hugging and its so emotional but I literally just walked up to her and was like oh okay its nice to meet you! She had never met me before and never had a conversation with me before either. I felt like the whole thing was poorly organized and I just felt sad that I couldn't connect with her really. We went to a local bar restaurant with other big/lil and it was cool. Anyways, ever since then she does not text me or talk to me in real life at all really. She doesn't hang out with me at chapter or go out with me at night. She hangs out with her big at every tailgate/function/group hangout and does not ask me to do anything. I told my mom all of this and she tells me to make a move, so I do. I have asked probably 3 times to hang out and she tells me 1) no sorry I can't 2) im studying sorry or 3) I'm so tired. I just feel really uncared for and have cried a couple of times about it. I know it's not a huge deal but this was something I was really looking forward to about being in a sorority. If anyone has gone through something similar please let me know any advice! ",3,1728958455.0,Sororities,2,1.0,False
