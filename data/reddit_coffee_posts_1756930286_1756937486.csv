So good. It‚Äôs been so long since I had a breakfast like this. Have finally finished my degree after three long years, single mum as well, so it‚Äôs been pretty hectic. But my son is at school and I could finally afford groceries/eggs no big bills this week, and earlier in the week got a vege box with mushrooms in it. Swiss brown buttons. Bit of baby spinach. Grain bread from supermarket bakery. Fresh free range eggs. Served with freshly ground and homebrewed latte/flat white/whatever, I have a fantastic coffee machine I won a few years ago. 

Unfortunately I overcooked the eggs. Will try again tomorrow, need to remember to make the toast before I put the eggs in to cook. They turn so quickly.",1,1756937406.0,eggs,0,1.0,False

We probably will only have one day set aside for a plantation tour, but otherwise would love to check out some local coffee. Bonus if you know of a place that does both coffee and chocolate (because kids). Unfortunately, I‚Äôm a bit worried that the popular/pre-arranged  options will probably showcase gross coffee.

Drinking water steadily throughout the day instead of chugging late at night

Cutting back on coffee (tough but worth it)

Adding more fruits/veggies that don‚Äôt irritate the bladder (like pears, cucumbers, spinach)

Doing light pelvic floor exercises

Managing stress better, since I noticed urgency worsens when I‚Äôm anxious


What‚Äôs kept me on track is finding little ways to stay consistent. I even started using an app that reminds me to drink water and shares small tips‚Äîit makes it easier to stick with these habits.

I'm looking for intel. My family are staring down the barrel of a marathon journey in Hamilton while our dad is in the ICU in Waikato Hospital. They've been flown in from out of town. I'm trying to gather good info on the places in Hamilton that will make this chapter of our lives a little less miserable. 

What I need?

**Best coffee spots**... good coffee, maybe a solid cabinet offering, somewhere they can drop in on their way to the hospital, grab something to go, and tackle the day caffeinated. 

**Best grocery stores**... they are currently staying in Hamilton East. What stores have good fresh produce, isn't too chaotic, and good access to pop in and out? I'd also take any ideas for fruit and veggie shops. 

**Best short walks**... self care and movement will be important over the coming weeks. Are there any pro tips for quiet places to be in nature, decompress, do a gentle walk? 

**Best massage/care spots**... the global family are already asking about places they could buy vouchers for mum to get a massage or a little bit of gentle care. Anything stand out to anyone? 

**Best healthy-ish takeout.**.. for exhausted days, where are the good places to grab something to eat that is not going to make the shit feelings worse? Esp. Japanese, Thai, or really good salady things? 

**Best pre-prepared meal options**... if anyone wanted to fill the freezer with good heat and eat kai, whats the local offering like? 

**Best hotels, motels, moter lodges for out of towners**... where would you suggest for 1-2 night stays for anyone who might want to visit once dad (fingers crossed) is up for visitors? Especially keen to know of places that are quieter and calm-ish. 

**Best anything around the hospital?**

The funeral ambiance was all around the house. The room was steeped in a heavy silence, the kind that presses against the chest and refuses to lift. Dim amber lights cast long shadows along the walls, illuminating the worn lines on mourners‚Äô faces, each etched deeper with grief. Everyone was in muted blacks or grey clothes with a cup of coffee or any hot beverage that was offered. The sadness was all over the rooms, the feeling that someone dearly to all of them had left, and the last time to see them was the last memory they had with them. Everyone just stood around softly murmuring about the life they had with Watts, worrying that they might disturb the sacred memory of the one they lost. Words were going around the room about what a nice guy he was and how small his cycle was, yet his death touched a bunch of people in that house. At the center stood a framed photo of Watts, his familiar smile now immortalized in stillness, resting atop a pedestal wreathed in white lilies and pale roses. The room was full, but everyone felt the dire emptiness all around the room.

Jason‚Äôs friends were all in the room, wondering how hard it must be for Jason, first not being able to grow up with his mother and now his dearly father, the one parent he had, having to die right by his side. They just couldn‚Äôt be sorrier for him, and nothing could ever match the type of sadness that their friend was having. Jake convinced them to go and see Jason up to his room. They all worked up the courage to do that. In fact, moments like these are the reason why they were all friends to bring each other up every time one is down.

Jake, Matt, Ryan, and Kaitlyn walked into the room. Jason was staring outside helplessly through the window, wondering how fast things had just escalated. He was deep in thought that he barely noticed his friends in his room. Jake held his shoulder; he turned to face him, his eyes all tired from all the grief and the constant disbelief of everything that had happened. For a moment, a little bit of hope filled his eyes. The hope that maybe he hadn‚Äôt lost everything that he ever had. He hugged all of them except for Kaitlyn, who was beside the group, leaving a chance for friends to work it out amongst themselves. Jake, Matt, and Ryan said their words of hope, trying to lift their friend's spirit up, which hardly worked. After a while, they all felt like they did all that was worth it, and they said their farewells to Jason, leaving the room to him and Kaitlyn alone.

They all moved close to each other and hugged tightly, Jason leaning his head on her shoulder restlessly. They weren‚Äôt that close, but the urge to let go to someone filled his head, and Kaitlyn just felt like a peace of mind. Tears of grief left his eyes as he sobbed quietly. Kaityn felt his pain as she softly ran her hands back and forth on his back, trying to calm him

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be alright, Jason, I‚Äôm right here now.‚Äù She said softly, trying to calm him down.

After a long while of a long hug, they all sat on the bed, Kaitlyn holding Jason‚Äôs hand, softly trying to move her fingers around it. Jason turned his face to her.

‚ÄúHe is all that I had left, and he‚Äôs now gone.‚Äù He said painfully as a tear rolled down his cheek.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Jason, you still have people who care deeply for you.‚Äù She said convincingly.

‚ÄúYes, but they are not him, they can never be.‚Äù He said a bit with a tone.

‚ÄúJason, I know it‚Äôs never going to be alright.‚Äù She stated. ‚ÄúThis emptiness you feel no one can ever fill, and I would be lying if I said that I understand what you‚Äôre feeling.‚Äù She moved a bit closer to him, keeping her hand around his shoulders. ‚ÄúBut I do not, what happened is loss, and to lose a loved, a dearly loved one, isn‚Äôt that easy at all.‚Äù She said, staring at Jason‚Äôs eyes, which stared back at her. ‚ÄúAll I can offer right now is to promise you that I‚Äôll be here by your side for as long as you need me, and if you call on me, I‚Äôll be right here, for the most parts.‚Äù She said as they both held hands, their fingers interlocking as that of a large fist.

They gazed on each other for a while, feeling the closure amongst them. That moment made them feel a bit closer to each other. What Jason heard from Kaitlyn and the fact that she was there with him even with the silence which did speak volumes, gave him almost all the closure he wanted.

‚ÄúThe other day at the lab, what were you working on?‚Äù Kaitlyn asked, trying to get his mind off the grief.

‚ÄúOh, did I not get a chance to explain it?‚Äù He said jokingly.

‚ÄúThere you go, now you‚Äôre cracking some jokes.‚Äù She smiled at him.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve got to give it to you, you have a special skill to raise my spirits.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she chuckled. ‚ÄúPlease stop, you are not making it any easier.‚Äù They both chuckled, and after a little silence, Jason cleared his throat.

‚ÄúWell, I was working on some antigen that would enhance the repair mechanism of body cells.‚Äù He explained.

‚ÄúSo basically, making some medicine to enable the body to heal fast?‚Äù She asked curiously.

‚ÄúYes, you get the gist, so a normal wound that would take maybe a month to heal will now heal for like an hour or two, plus some mild nightmares maybe, judging on the discomfort of the lab rats I‚Äôve experimented with.‚Äù He explained.

‚ÄúWow, that would be a huge breakthrough.‚Äù She said, more surprised.

‚ÄúOh yeah, if only I made it on time for my dad to even see it,‚Äù Jason said with regret.

¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to have much more impact, Jason; it‚Äôs like a small price to pay for greatness, although it‚Äôs unfair,‚Äù Kaitlyn explained, trying to make him understand.

Jason stared at her, ‚ÄúHow do you know what to say every time and make me feel alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess I just get you the same way you get me.‚Äù She explained.

‚ÄúWe get each other.‚Äù He said as they held hands and stared deep in their eyes.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be there for each other every time in need, how about that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be happy to be there for you every time you call on me.‚Äù He said confidently.

The room livened up a bit as they both shared their childhood stories, Kaitlyn trying to make Jason feel like his life has not gone to waste and that there‚Äôs more to come in life. And Jason is just trying to stay with the good memories he had with his father. It was a lovely moment. At that moment, Jason felt like his problem might just end, and there were more things to look forward to. Jason fell for her more deeply, and she got to know the guy she‚Äôs falling for more and more. After a long while of that sharing and empathy, Kaitlyn noticed the red dusk filling the room.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm doing alright, you can go and maybe come back tomorrow,‚Äù Jason suggested.

‚ÄúAre you sure, because I can easily make an excuse for myself to not go home today.‚Äù She insisted.

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll be alright, just go for now, let me have some alone time, at least for this night.‚Äù He explained. ‚ÄúMaybe try to figure things out on my own and then see how I‚Äôll move forward.‚Äù He added briefly.

Kaitlyn gazed at his face carefully, then she brought herself to stand up from the bed. ‚ÄúOkay, if you insist that much.‚Äù She then turned and faced him again. ‚ÄúJust take care of yourself, you‚Äôre going to be all alone.‚Äù She insisted.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Kate, I can take care of myself. Just be careful on your way back.‚Äù He told her with a more of caring tone.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my best, Jason.‚Äù She said as she put on her shoes.

Jason also got off the bed. He escorted her outside, and they shared a hug. A hug that, when it was released, the feeling of something more crossed both of their minds. Something had to be shared more than just a hug. She faced the ground while she licked her lips, then released a soft sigh. Jason held her hand and pulled her closer to him, then kissed her gently on her forehead. She smiled effortlessly and kept a few strands of her hair behind her ear. Jason smiled back, and they both said their farewells for the night. Jason watched her drive off. Immediately as her car left, that feeling of emptiness struck him again, this time harder than before. His mind raced, not knowing what to do, feeling helpless and hopeless. He dragged his body upstairs to his room, trying to find something to do.

In his room, he glanced at the antibody he was working on. The feeling of working on it more filled his head. He had seen something different when he used his blood, his blood samples were all made of different parts of DNA than any other he had tried with. He began working on it with his blood samples. Deep in his work that he entirely forgot that he was grieving. He fueled all his emotions on what he was working on. His mind kept pushing as if his last breath depended on the antibody in the next minute. He did all that he could, and after a couple of hours, he was all done. He let the computer run the diagnosis, and he fell on his bed utterly tired, failing even to pull a blanket to cover himself up. The room was filled with an unusual silence, and all he heard was just a beep from the computer, which was soothing enough for him to fall deeply asleep.

¬†

¬†

The cruel nightmare of his skin tearing from his body and a hairy body emerging underneath the skin woke him up. The pain he felt could not be more real. He stared at his fingertips, then his nails. Which were both in the right state. He rushed to the computer, and the satisfaction of finding all the work done was just pure satisfaction for him. He loaded a syringe with the antibody, then stared at it with quite an ambitious feeling about it. It had to work right at that moment. It was that moment or never. Nothing couldn‚Äôt work this time; he was sure of it.

Suddenly, the hair at the back of his neck stood firmly, for a moment, he had a strange feeling, and he kept his hand at the back of his neck trying to calm himself down. Something felt off. He kept his hands on the table, clenched his hands into fists, and inhaled deeply, forcing himself to focus. He exhaled slowly while opening his eyes; his pupils were pulsing with a deep amber color, and he saw their reflection on the window mirror in front of him. He moved closer to examine himself more, but he got interrupted by an unusual heartbeat. He turned in its direction as a foreign scent, yet a bit familiar, filled his nostrils. The same scent and heartbeat that he heard when his dad died. A different primal instinct was all over him. He glanced around the room, only for his eyes to settle on the syringe loaded fully with the antibody. He grabbed it and had a peek from the window, trying to see what was going on outside the house. The scents got closer and for a moment it was as if he was seeing the scents, as clear as if scents were colors. His breathes went fast and so did his heartbeats. He took another look at the syringe. This time, he saw his nails slowly turning to claws. The skin covering his nails was slowly tearing as his nails pushed out. He quickly injected himself with the syringe at his neck. He took a deep breath and pushed all of the antibody in his body. He threw the syringe and dashed as fast as he could downstairs.

In the living room, he was greeted with the loud banging of the door. His bones crackled; he felt the pain in his spine. His nails were now fully developed into claws. He tore his shirt easily as he was trying to scratch himself. A glance at his chest and he saw all of his skin peering from his body, revealing what was a hairy and built-up chest. He noticed that he was getting taller, his trousers tore, leaving only a simple short-like piece. He felt the pain of his skin peeling away and bones crackling to form a different body structure. He screamed with pain, only for it to turn to an angry groan. He put his hand on his mouth only to feel a long mouth as that of a wolf. He felt his teeth completely turned to predatory canines. For a moment, he glanced at the mirror from the windows only to see what he‚Äôs become. He was about seven feet tall, a fully developed Lycan, his eyes dull amber. He raised his hands to see his claws and paws. The continuous banging of the door brought him back to the moment. He took a step and groaned angrily as loudly as he could. For a second, everything went silent. His heavy breaths were all over the house. After a short while, the door kept on banging. He dashed to it with the animosity he never knew he had, he teared the door easily with his claws and held on to one of the soldiers banging the door, leaving the others thrown back, struggling to catch a glance of what just came out the house. Jason held the soldier very angrily and groaned at him ferociously. Every soldier halted for a bit, trying to see what was to happen next. Eight feet of snarling muscle and fur, eyes glowing molten gold, claws like machetes. He ripped off the merc‚Äôs head clean, spine dangling like a snapped whip. He launches himself into the squad before they could make more moves, like a meteor of muscle and teeth. Blood exploding into the air.¬†¬† ¬†

It was all chaos; some soldiers tried to run, and others were brave enough to shoot back, but nothing succeeded; they were all better off running away. Jason grabbed one soldier trying to retreat. He tore through his torso, organs spilling out in a wet pile. Blood splattered all around the compound, like a grueling warzone with all body parts every step, soldiers being slaughtered mercilessly. Still, Jason stopped at nothing. Bullets hammer into his frame, but they only fueled more rage in him. He grabbed a soldier, slammed him into the ground so hard his helmet caved into his skull, and he swung the body like a club, snapping limbs and skulls in a symphony of gore. ¬†He held two soldiers, one on each of his paws, as he howled loudly. He threw the soldiers to the ground and stepped on their heads. He growled with satisfaction and then kicked the dead bodies away. An armored truck was still shooting at him. He jumped close to it. One merc besides Jason easily punched through his chest, holding his heart in his hand, and he tossed it aside like trash. The soldiers in it were thrown around in the truck, hoping for a death far less cruel. Jason growled deeply, thunderously, inhumanely. He gripped the truck‚Äôs front bumper, muscles bulging, struggling to lift it. Metal groaning, wheels spinning uselessly in the air. With a final roar, he hurled the truck straight at the house, crashing through the front, exploding in fire and shattered wood. He groaned angrily as he saw everything burst into flames. The country house was nothing but a strong blaze of fire. The constant screaming of injured soldiers filled the compound. Jason stood before the blaze, blood and soot dripping from his fur, chest rising with every ragged breath. All the eyes that looked back at Jason were struck with fear and helplessness; they couldn‚Äôt do anything more. If they had known that this was what they were up against, they would‚Äôve done everything not to be on that battlefield. A feeling of guilt filled Jason's heart, weighing heavily as if trying to bring him down. Something was about to wear him down back to his human form. The mess he had made was too much for him to see. He slowly began feeling a relief as he began to slowly go back to his normal height. He dashed into the woods as he was transforming back, not to see the mess he did when he will be in his right state.

The forest was a blur of shadow and mist, the first hints of dawn piercing through the canopy in pale streaks. The heavy sound of the helicopter‚Äôs propellers woke him up. He found sanctuary beside one of the stash boxes his father kept around the thick forest. He carefully examined his environment, praying that what had happened last night was just a nightmare. But the torn trousers were a constant reminder that things are not normal at all. He quickly stared at his fingertips, then his claws, thankful that it was all over and he was back to normal. He rubbed his eyes as if trying to wash away the sleepiness from them. He searched in the stash box; he grabbed the torch and a heavy fur jacket that he put on. He quickly reached for the bottle full of water and gulped a massive amount of water while also trying as hard as he could to catch his breath. When his thirst was quenched, his breath slowed down for a while, and everything around him seemed to be more specific, even the scents of different animals in the forest. He tried to catch a trace of anything that sounded dangerous, but the helicopters in the sky were just too loud. He stood up, then began slowly pacing around the forest with his flashlight off to avoid suspicions from the helicopters in the sky.

Heavy footsteps edged closer and closer to him; they didn‚Äôt sound human, and not even any normal animal thrusted its feet on the ground like that. The scent and the heartbeats made Jason quite sure that he was up against something not normal at all. The thrashing of the trees and bushes was evident that the creatures hunting him were very close to him. He started dashing away, trying to run away from them. His legs carried him as fast as he could, and he later went on all fours, grabbing the ground with his claws, trying to find that grip to make his run more agile. The footsteps were still getting closer and closer, and before he knew it, he sensed that the creatures were mere meters away from him. Jason kept running as fast as he could, muscles burning, lungs heaving, but his focus was sharper than the knife‚Äôs edge. Bark rips under his grip as he vaults over fallen logs and slides beneath hanging roots. Every movement is fluid, desperate, and deliberate.

Jason‚Äôs boots thud against a low boulder. He kicked off it and grabbed a jutting branch, swinging himself into the trees. A narrow path formed in his mind. He hit the parkour with great agile movements, perfectly landing every step where it‚Äôs supposed to. Springboarded off a stump, wall kicked off a moss-covered rock face, he raised his arms, grabbed a low branch, hurling himself into a backflip, vanishing into the mist midair. They were left startled, not seeing any trace of what they were hunting. Their heavy breaths took over; that was the only thing heard in that area. Suddenly, a strong thud behind them. Jason landed behind them, crouched low in a patch of disturbed leaves. His arms were thick with fur, claws extended, spine slightly arched. His eyes gleamed feral amber in the soft light of dawn. Their breath steamed in the cold air. The creatures turned, but they were far too late; Jason was already charging towards them with such feral energy in his veins.

The moment the first creature whirled, Jason lunged in the air like a launched spear. His clawed hand ripped through its chest, splattering black ichor across the bark. It screeched, but he did not stop; he slammed his shoulder into it, cracking bones, sending it flying into a tree that split on impact. The second one was on its way, leaped towards Jason, teeth bared. Jason spins under its strike, hooks his claws into its guts, dragging a gory arc across its midsection. It howled and slashed wildly, catching his arm, blood spraying all over like a leaking pipe. Jason growled deep with pain, animalistic, his eyes flaring with such rage. He grabbed the creature by the throat and slammed it into the ground, again, again, then again, until the dirt was painted dark. Its snarls died in a gurgle. That‚Äôs when Jason left it for death. The other one was already up, charging. Jason met it halfway. They collided like beasts of war jaws snapping, claws tearing. It grabbed him strongly then lifted him. He bit down into its neck, ripping sinew, his mouth coated in gore. He flipped it drove his elbow into its skull so hard it cracked mimicking a dry wood cracking.

Both creatures staggered, wounded, hissing but Jason didn‚Äôt wait. He surged forward, a flurry of claw strikes and brutal kicks. He ducked, spun, leaped off a rock and came down hard, both claws driving through one beast‚Äôs shoulders, pinning it to the forest floor. It screeched once, then went still no more energy for another movement. The helicopter whirring spooked him again, he walked slowly towards the dying creature, his half Lycan form towering in the twilight fog, steam rising off his wounds. He grabbed its skull and snapped its neck clean, black ichor gushing from its severed neck. Jason threw it on the ground scanned his surrounding quickly, the forest still again mist drifting, leaves fluttering from disturbed trees. He couldn‚Äôt waste any more time he charged as fast as he could deeper into the thick forest.

The wind was all settled, what was left of the country house stood like the bones of a beast, blackened ribs of timber piercing the sky., smoke rising like whispers towards the heavens. Crows circled overhead as a beacon of disaster already happened. They kept their distance from something far worse than fire. The silence was thick, pressed down over the clearing like a velvet curtain. The wind further cleared an opening as if welcoming something.

A shape moved, it was not the rustle of wind or the shift of burnt wood, it was more intentional, controlled, with a hint of danger. A feminine figure stepped through the ash and cinders with the precision of someone used to moving death. She has been carefully following through incidents like these eager to find something, something maybe that she lost, or perhaps the truth, no one knew for sure. She was a lone wolf carefully gathering clues whenever she was. She had no unit, no banner, and definitely no allegiances, only a purpose. She learnt how to survive the hard way, alone learning from her past mistakes.

Everything she wore was black slick, form fitted tactical fabric that hugged her figure like second skin. Completely blending with the shadows. Her coat long and split at the sides, moved around her like ink spilled in water. The sleeves were tight, her gloves reinforced. Her boots made no sound despite stepping on glass and gravel. Slung across her back was a high-tension arrow gun handcrafted, matte and silent. On her hip, twin silver revolvers sleek, modified for recoil and precision. Resting diagonally along her lower back, a folded war fan blade with obsidian edges and a custom locking grip, an elegant weapon for someone who never wasted a movement.

Her hair was brunette, thick but disciplined, sweptback into a low tail beneath her hood. Her face heart shaped, framed with subtle strands that softened her otherwise commanding presence. And her eyes, God her eyes. They were forest green, with just a hint of brown when they caught the light. Not quite human, not quite supernatural, but entirely unreadable. You did not meet Felicity‚Äôs eyes, you survived them.

She walked through the skeleton of the cabin, one hand brushing a half-burnt photo pinned to the remains of a wall. The image was gone, consumed by smoke, but stared at it like it still held meaning. Then she knelt, running two fingers through the soot-dusted floorboards, lifting them to her nose. Blood, Steal, Silver, Lycan sweat, burnt oil, adrenaline, and something else. Something a bit more interesting and more familiar.

Felicity stood again, slow and deliberate, her silhouette a cut-out of shadow in the wreckage, the perfection in an imperfection you might say. She walked through the space like a ghost in a cathedral, reverent and unafraid. This meant something for her, she was close to finding him closer than ever. Someone did survive this and she was going for him. It didn‚Äôt matter what happened when she gets to him, what mattered was she was closer than ever.

Her gaze drifted to the claw marks in the wall, the crumpled truck half inside what used to be the bedroom, and a torn flag of the AlphaCorp, now shredded and caked with dried marrow. She smiled the sense of warmth, getting closer to exactly what she has been tracking. The wind picked up again, catching the edge of her coat as she turned and stepped back through the doorway if you could still call it that. She did not run. She did not need to. She was certain that this time she had all the cards right.

¬†

The wind screamed between the trees like it was warning the forest itself. The continuous thud of Jason‚Äôs feet on the ground made more of rhythm, feral and fast his breathes all over the place. Running while still making sure nothing was following him. Jason dashed through the forest, jumping across fallen tree barks keeping his momentum as long as he could. The ghost of fire still in his lungs and ash in his veins, muscles thrumming beneath his skin. His claws half-sprung, beneath ragged from sprint and fury. He was reeling from the last fight, the creatures did get the best of him, his back raw with healing wounds, his ribs tight and fractured. There was a scent pulling him closer, burnt pine, wet fur, the closer he got the clearer it got.

He broke through a thicket of bramble and stumbled into a clearing, a natural amphitheater of moss, rock, and silence. The moonlight stabbed through the trees in long but dull pale rays. A figure stood at the center, bones cracking finalizing its transformation waiting for war to begin. Black-furred Lycan, taller, broader, covered in tons of fresh wounds fueled with such anger and ferocity. Shoulders like a monster carved from war itself. This was more different maybe a bit taller than Jason‚Äôs Lycan form an inch or even four. A red scar clawed down his face, still raw.

Jason halted restlessly. Then again, this surge of energy flowed in his veins awakening the feral instinct inside of him. He wasn‚Äôt ready for another fight, but the monster laying inside him wasn‚Äôt getting enough of it. His blood surged, and before thought could rise, instinct devoured it. He snarled and charged and the other Lycan mirrored him.

The sound they made as they collided was violence distilled flesh hitting flesh, bone striking bone, claws slashing wild arcs through the air. Jason struck first, claws across the chest, opening skin, but the other Lycan tanked the blow and slammed his head into Jason‚Äôs jaw, spinning him sideways. Jason rolled and leapt up, not Jason anymore, but something in-between. Wolfish, long-limbed, predatory. He lunged low, but he grabbed Jason mid leap and suplexed Jason into a rock, shattering it like brittle glass. No words went between them, only feral growls and heaving breath and pure, animosity between them.

Jason‚Äôs knee connected with the other Lycan‚Äôs side. The other Lycan‚Äôs elbow crushed down on Jason‚Äôs spine. They tumbled again, kicked apart, both steaming with sweat and blood. Jason darted forward, shoulder-checking him into a tree with a crunch, but he responded with a swift, savage backhand, sending Jason skidding through dirt and roots. For a moment they paused, panting, teeth bared, claws twitching. It was strength with strength unmatched between the two. Neither knew the other but they both assumed the worst.

At the edge of the clearing a shadow moved, Felicity stood just beyond the tree line, still as a statue, the wind pressing her coat back like wings of midnight. Her war-fan blade rested folded in one hand, her other slowly lowering the arrow gun from her back. Her storm-glass eyes studied them, calculating, unblinking, she held her cool, not speaking not yet waiting for the right moment. One wrong move and she could be collateral damage.

Jason surged again. He caught him by the throat this time, dragging him backward, but he twisted midair and planted both feet into Jason‚Äôs stomach, sending Jason crashing to the earth. Leaves flew. Dust kicked up like smoke. He stood, blood dripping from his mouth, Jason rose slower this time taking a look at his clawed-up chest, fresh wounds all over closing up, the sound of meat just mushing with each other.

Felicity took her time she moved swiftly yet very fast, in a blur, she crossed the distance between them, pivoted on one heel, and swept Jason‚Äôs legs clean out from under him. He fell with a grunt, face-first into dirt, too winded to recover in time. Her war-fan blade pressed gently at the back of Jason‚Äôs neck.

‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù She said strongly commanding attention.

Jason growled, twitching beneath her.

‚ÄúI said enough.‚Äù She repeated, sharper now, in a voice that shook the clearing. She didn‚Äôt press the blade, but her intent was a weight all its own.

The other Lycan, halfway to rising, paused. His eyes widened. Slowly, his bones cracked, from shrinking, posture falling in on itself like a dying fire. Muscle receded, fur withdrew, until only the man remained. At this point Jason saw an uncanny resemblance, his hair chestnut brown color all wet from sweat and hints of blood, poorly kept, long but not falling across his diamond shaped face. His eyes pure hazel with a hint of honey, they looked tired though widened with anticipation. His slightly pointed nose dripping drops of sweat rolling from his forehead. He staggered upright bruised, filthy, and battered, but his eyes shone.

Jason all confused glanced at Felicity as she retracted her war-fan blade. Jason slowly stood also turning human.

‚ÄúFelicity‚Ä¶‚Äù her name fell from the lips of the other male like a ghost.

She was staring at him not at Jason anymore. ‚ÄúDanvers.‚Äù She whispered her expression didn‚Äôt change, but her hand trembled slightly before tightening on the hilt of her weapon.

Jason blinked up to her. ‚ÄúYou two know each other?‚Äù Felicity still didn‚Äôt look at him, her stare was still on Danvers.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still alive.‚Äù She said a little bit glad.

Jason‚Äôs wounds healed completely; he stared at both of them cautious, maybe even ready for another brawling fight against the two if he‚Äôs brought to it. ‚ÄúSomebody, start explaining.‚Äù

Felicity sighed and finally stepped back, letting her blade fold with a metallic whisper. She glanced between the two. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you see that you are the same kind.‚Äù

‚ÄúNext time ask each other a thing or two before jumping on your throats.‚Äù She explained, then faced Jason. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúJason.‚Äù He stated.

‚ÄúJason son of who?‚Äù She asked as if knowing what to expect.

‚ÄúJason son of Watts.‚Äù He said as if angry with the amount of negging he‚Äôs receiving.

Felicity then turned her glance towards Danvers, giving him the I told you so look. ‚ÄúSee.‚Äù She sighed. ‚ÄúIt does help knowing who you‚Äôre about to kill even if he‚Äôs your brother.‚Äù

‚ÄúBrother?‚Äù Jason asked more confused with the unfolding of things. ‚ÄúMy brother died, the same night those mercs took my mother for dead.‚Äù He said pointing at the direction the cabin house he thought was.

‚ÄúAnd who told you that?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúOkay, Felicity, is it? I‚Äôm not quite getting fond of your tone.‚Äù He glanced at her a bit with rage.

‚ÄúCalm down Jackson...‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Jason.‚Äù Jason corrected getting a bit frustrated and angrier.

‚ÄúOkay, Jason not the time now.‚Äù She stared at him as he exhaled heavily.

‚ÄúMy Dad told me so.‚Äù Jason explained.

‚ÄúAnd where is he?‚Äù Danvers asked.

Jason stared deep into the forest with deep frustration. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead, they got to him yesterday.‚Äù He explained carefully landing his watery eyes on Danvers‚Äô face. ‚ÄúYou look like him, more than the way I do.‚Äù Jason admitted.

‚ÄúYou look more like mother, her unwavering determination to punch back when she‚Äôs punched, it‚Äôs all in your eyes.‚Äù Danvers explained.

‚ÄúShe dead too?‚Äù Jason asked. Danvers nodded with deep regret.

‚ÄúShe reminded me of you, I thought they got you too.‚Äù He admitted trying to catch a step or two. ‚ÄúLast time I saw you was the night before your first birthday.‚Äù Danvers moved closer to Jason, laying his hand over Jason‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúLast time we broke out we hid in this forest an abandoned house couple yards from here. We only saw dad, and she was there.‚Äù Danvers pointed at Felicity. ‚ÄúLaid low for a month or so, couldn‚Äôt really kept track of time.‚Äù He explained.

‚ÄúWe better head that way then, find a place to lay low for the night and maybe see what to do next.‚Äù Jason suggested.

They all agreed on that, and began covering ground towards the location where the abandoned safehouse was.

¬†

The house had long since collapsed in on itself. Only half a roof remained, blackened, warped. Its walls bowed outward, like it had sighed and never exhaled. Windows were holes now, frame-splintered and blind. But there was space to lie down, a few floorboards unburnt, and shelter from the rising wind. They found it useless to light a fire on that night. The moon hung low over the forest, dimmed behind cloud cover. The night birds had gone silent, perhaps warned off by the blood still drying on Jason‚Äôs knuckles. He had a quite a day and never really caught a relaxing rest after the one he had when he was waiting for the antidote diagnosis. The thought of it made him eager to check his blood activity the cells and how the antidote was working on him. He checked for wounds around his body, but not even scars were visible.

Jason sat cross-legged against the wall, breathing deep, arms resting on his knees. He watched Danvers, his brother apparently still he couldn‚Äôt in any way figured that the day would end with him finding his brother, and this magnificent girl who clearly is in some sort of complicated scenario with Danvers, Felicity everything about her was a mystery. Her clothes weapons of choice and her eyes you had to survive them. Danvers‚Äô head bowed, the silver gleam of an old dog tag flickering under the folds of his tor shirt. He on the other hand had quite an experience for the past couple of days. He escaped what he would say an impossible prison to break out to. In there he had no rest, it was constant torture and blood samples taken from him everything in there was just brutal, a complete survival place to be in. He watched his mother die, blaming himself only if he was fighting with her side to side maybe she could survive even a couple of hours even minutes longer.

Felicity on the other hand she was a complete mystery indeed. She was the only one pacing around, out the wreckage of a house and back in with various valuable supplies. She was constantly checking the perimeter as if trying to get a clear image of the surroundings. She easily vanished into the trees with more of a ghost-like ease, and then emerged back carrying a small bundle of scavenged supplies and rain-damp leaves to bed down with.

Apart from Felicity movements and the wind everything remained still, quiet as ever. Only when the silence thickened too far did Jason finally ask, voice low and quiet.

‚ÄúHow did she die?‚Äù

Danvers slowly turned his gaze to Jason. ‚ÄúWe were on the verge of escape I thought splitting up would help more, so I told her to focus on moving out.‚Äù He explained failing to continue his eyes filling up with tears.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to get into detail now.‚Äù Jason said a bit patronizing. ‚ÄúJust tell me who she was.‚Äù He demanded.

‚ÄúHer name was Getrude, Queen of the Varienth bloodline. The last true matriarch.‚Äù He spoke with such gravitas as if deeming how powerful she was.

Jason blinked hard. ‚ÄúI only know her name; I had no idea that I was this thing.‚Äù He said honestly.

‚ÄúShe knew.‚Äù Danvers stared out through a hole in the roof. ‚ÄúShe always called the precious young prince, she left you with Dad, she never wanted any of us to been taken away, but it just happened to me and she was filled with much regret even after the last time they captured us again.‚Äù

He ran a hand through his dirty hair. ‚ÄúThey took her first, I watched arrows jolting with electricity shot through her, I just couldn‚Äôt I was too young to see it but I did see it.‚Äù

Jason‚Äôs stomach twisted. ‚ÄúAnd now she can‚Äôt even see me for who I really am.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe always knew exactly what you are, and what power you have in the Varienth bloodline.‚Äù Danvers comforted him.

‚ÄúShe died knowing I was safe, and I never knew if she was a Queen or anything.‚Äù Jason pressed a fist to his chest, something hot and broken rising in his throat. ‚ÄúWho even does that?‚Äù He asked angrily.

Felicity sat down beside Danvers now, her expression unreadable, hands resting atop her folded legs.

‚ÄúShe died a Queen. Fighting. That‚Äôs what is worth remembering.‚Äù She insisted.

Danvers leaned into her, briefly like instinct, shoulder against hers. Jason saw the small flicker in her eyes as they touched, something long-missing and fragile returning to the surface.

‚ÄúYou two?‚Äù Jason asked.

Felicity didn‚Äôt look away from the floor. ‚ÄúWe were. Until the last time he escaped. They caught up to us. We split to survive.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought you were dead.‚Äù Danvers said, his voice cracked. ‚ÄúThey had your scent. They sent the hunters. I heard the shots.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt easy to catch.‚Äù Her smile was sad, but real. ‚ÄúAnd I made damn sure they regretted trying, more like what Jason did with the country house, only less environmental destruction.‚Äù



Danvers sat up straighter, jaw tight. His fists clenched. ‚ÄúI always thought I‚Äôd see Dad again. Even after the last time.‚Äù He whispered. ‚ÄúTo ask why he never came for us. Why he let her die.‚Äù

Jason shook his head. ‚ÄúKnowing him, I think he didn‚Äôt want to lose me too, maybe waiting for me to become who I am then burn Alphacorp from the inside.‚Äù

A long silence followed, Then Felicity spoke.

‚ÄúDanvers, they wanted a weapon out of you, and they settled for your blood, to make something they would control.‚Äù She sighed. ‚ÄúThey killed the people you loved the most, the world of yours and they both were trying to fight.‚Äù She glanced between the two. ‚ÄúBut the legacies they left are you two.‚Äù

Jason looked up. His eyes weren‚Äôt feral anymore. They were just tired, Human. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to do this.‚Äù He admitted. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm supposed to be.‚Äù

Danvers gave a bitter smile. ‚ÄúThat makes two of us.‚Äù

Felicity reached into her coat and pulled out a worn piece of cloth faded with time, stitched with an insignia Jason didn‚Äôt recognize: a crest of two wolves circling a crown.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about what you were supposed to be.‚Äù She said sounding even more optimistic. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bigger than that.‚Äù She paused a bit trying to weigh her next words even more. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about what you decide to become.‚Äù

The room went silent, Felicity trying to shift her glance between the two. Making sure that they got the gravity of what she was saying. The words were heavy for both Jason and Danvers. Are they going to run away, or they going to fight. And most significantly how are they going to fight, what‚Äôs the strategy, in fact they will be going against a bigger enemy not even their parents succeeded to fight against.

They rested in silence, Danvers falling asleep first, leaning back into the wall, shoulders slumping like a weight was slowly being pulled from him. Felicity sat awake a while longer, watching him with eyes that betrayed old pain and older love. Jason remained by the broken window, the cool night air licking against his skin. He stared up at the sky. For the first time, he felt the weight of blood not as a curse but as a question.",1,1756936144.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False
1n7s1v2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n7s1v2,Big Island trip report (still can‚Äôt believe our luck with catching the Kilauea eruption üåã),"Took a family trip to Big Island (4 adults, 2 grandparents, 1 toddler). First time in Big Island but we have been to Hawaii before (Maui, Oahu and Kauai). We stayed in Waikoloa the entire time and drove all over the island, with a mix of relaxation at beaches and the resort, and some excursions for snorkeling and volcanoes. Overall had such a good time even though it was only 5 full days (plus two days on either end for travel). We were so so lucky catching the Kilauea eruption on our last day! 

**Day 1 (Resort day and Manta Ray snorkel)**
- **Hilton Waikoloa Village**. It‚Äôs really massive, very family and kids oriented, and the pools are quite large and extensive. There‚Äôs no beach access from the resort. But they do have their own saltwater lagoon and manmade beaches so it‚Äôs great for little kids. We spent most of our time at the larger pool. 
- ** Waikoloa Shrimp Co.** Delicious garlic shrimp. We also got some poke from the grocery store **Island Gourmet Market**, which was alright but nothing special. 
- **Anaeho ªomalu Beach**. It was super windy during the afternoon so we mostly watched the kite surfers. Water was kind of murky (not good for snorkeling). Also took a walk to the King‚Äôs Shops and had **Gypsea Gelato**
- **Manta Ray Night Snorkel**. We went with a smaller boat by **Coral Reef Snorkel Adventures** (10-12 person tour). The ride was really bumpy. We were sitting on the rubber sides and holding on to the bars the entire way. The snorkeling portion was absolutely magical. If you are looking for more adventure and thrill, this was pretty fun, but if you get seasick easily I would highly suggest booking with a bigger boat. 

**Day 2 (Kona and Captain Cook)**
- **La'aloa Beach Park (Magic Sands)** Really big waves at this one and a lot of boogie boarders. Felt a lot more like a locals beach, not so many tourists, probably because of dangerous waves and rocks. Sand was very soft, water was bright blue. There‚Äôs also a shaded area with trees on one side. 
- **Sacred Grounds Coffee Farm** Incredible patio overlooking the ocean and great coffee too. One of my favorite places we visited.
- **Kaaloa's Super J's** Good and affordable lunch plates. I‚Äôd recommend taking it to go and finding a park or somewhere else to eat, since the inside is pretty small, hot and stuffy. 
- **Honaunau Bay (‚ÄúTwo Step‚Äù)** Nice grassy park with shade to hang out, and ok snorkeling. Visibility wasn‚Äôt great since we went in the afternoon.
- **Kona**. Walked around town, did some gift shopping and got an Acai bowl from **Kona Wave Cafe**. Was super hot and humid so we didn‚Äôt walk around as much as I would have liked. 

**Day 3 (Snorkel Excursion and resort)**
- **Kealakekua Bay Snorkel** with **Fair Wind Cruises**. Well run tour, spacious boat, good food, and attentive service. We did the morning tour with 2.5 hrs of snorkeling. The snorkeling was great and very good for beginners. It was also kid-friendly, they had some boogie boards with a little viewing portal in the middle so kids can just sit on the board and look into the water. 
- **Pa'akai Poke**. Our favorite poke from the trip. Outdoor seating only, we took it to go and ate it back at our hotel. 
- Back to the **Hilton** to relax. We went to the other side of the resort to explore. There‚Äôs some nice walking trails around the property, and good sunset views. 

**Day 4 (Beach and resort day)**
- **Waialea Beach**. Amazing beach with lots of shade, and great snorkeling. The water was a little bit choppy due to wind so the snorkeling is more intermediate level here (you need to be able to swim well). 
- **Hilton resort**. Revisited the pool and just relaxed and took a nap. 

**Day 5 (Hilo and Volcano National Park)**
- **Hilo**. Went to **Puna Chocolate** to pick up some souvenirs, then **Two Ladies Kitchen** for mochi. It was good but not really worth the long wait. We got some takeout from **Suisan Fish Market** (poke was good) and **Kitchen Umeke** (awesome little Japanese spot with bento boxes and sushi to go)
- **Volcanoes National Park**. Got extremely lucky to witness an active lava fountain at Kilauea! We saw the big smoke plume on the drive there. Also did the Lava Tube walk, but otherwise we didn‚Äôt do a lot. Mostly just walked along the crater rim to see the eruption. Honestly for most people one day is probable enough to see the highlights, I‚Äôm glad we did not try to stay overnight in Hilo or in the park area. It would only make sense if you want to do some serious hikes in the park. 
- **Punalu ªu Beach (Black Sand Beach)** Really pretty beach, we saw a few turtles poking their heads out of the water, but with the strong waves it‚Äôs pretty hard to see them up close. 
- **Honokohau Beach** a very secluded beach, kind of hidden but once we got there it was really stunning. Saw turtles right from the beach shore. 
- **Beach Tree at the Four Seasons**. The vibe, live music, dining right next to the beach and ocean was A+, and the food was actually delicious too. Afterwards we walked along the private beach boardwalk. Great way to cap off our trip!

**Hotel:**
We stayed in **Waikoloa Colony Villas**. Our townhome was newly remodeled, had good AC, a lot of space, in-unit washer and dryer, a kitchen, Hilton Resort Pass, bikes, beach chairs, boogie boards, hand cart for hauling beach gear (which was super helpful). The whole Waikoloa area is a giant resort and golf course suburban rich neighborhood vibe. It‚Äôs very nice, clean and quiet, but feels far removed from the local island scene and has no nightlife. It was perfect for our family style vacation but could feel isolated and boring for couples (unless you plan to spend a ton of time golfing or at the resort). 

**Weather:**
- Mix of sunshine and a bit of clouds and rain. I think Waikoloa side was much more dry and sunny than elsewhere on the island. The landscape was very dessert-like, brown and lava-rocky compared to Kona or Captain Cook areas which were green and lush, but also had more rain and humidity. Still beautiful in its own way but if you want that lush tropical vibe, staying around Kona may be better. 
- Big Island felt a lot windier than other islands we‚Äôve been to. We pretty much never used the beach umbrella and just found shade under trees. 
- Volcanoes National Park was significantly cooler than the rest of the island. It was a nice change.

**Tips:**
- Many of the casual food places (eg plate lunch) are cash only, and may not have AC
- Check the opening days and hours of everything! Most things are not open all 7 days a week 
- Loved having a kitchen and being able to cook food for breakfast and dinner. Overall, food was pretty mid, and expensive
- Book a hotel/apartment that comes with beach amenities. Having the Hilton resort pass and beach gear was amazing. We didn‚Äôt have to rent or buy anything for the beach. ",8,1756936090.0,VisitingHawaii,3,1.0,False

Okay... is anyone familiar with how some autistic folks find it therapeutic to be squeezed tightly? As that is what I'm hoping to maybe find from this post.

Essentially, there's a lot weighing on me lately. I'm dealing with chronic and worsening health stuff, I'm feeling disconnected from the city and local social communities (health stuff makes it hard to go out), and with a project I'm working on at the moment? It is definitely an overwhelming, and intimidating task, and honestly even if it is a passion project, I wonder if I bit off more than I could chew.

With all of this (and more) weighing on me... I'm sort of feeling this overwhelming urge to just be held, and squeezed. I mean, it is one of those things that has been known to bring comfort to many people who are on the autistic spectrum after all, including myself. And no, this isn't a ""hug"" like some people thought I meant on my last posts. To be honest, it doesn't even have to involve physical contact. I mean, just having me wrapped up in a blanket burrito, and being squeezed from the outside of the burrito would be much closer to what I'm hoping for out of this. 

Of course I'd absolutely love to cook you some food! We could watch a show, listen to music, talk (or not), and of course we could do the squeeze whenever you felt comfortable! The squeeze would ideally last for a few minutes, but that can be discussed. I just think it should be long enough that i can actually allow myself to relax into it. Ideally, we should talk online, and meet for a coffee first since something like this requires at least a bit of established trust. 

Honestly, I don't even know if posting this will yield anything. I'm nervous about even being this vulnerable with expressing a need like this. But hey, I've met some fabulous people on reddit before... so honestly? Why not?

If you are open to this concept, feel free to reach out! I'd love to talk, and see what we can do from there! If you'd benefit from a good squeeze too, I can do the same for you!

A bit about me! I'm 26, non binary, living in Coquitlam (but can travel anywhere!). I'm neurodivergent (obviously), and have interests that range from music, art, and creativity, to transit, and horror! I love going out into nature sometimes, but I also enjoy staying in, and gaming too. I'm also trying to get into alternative fashion more!

For something like this, I probably would prefer to connect with other LGBTQ+ folks, and neurodivergent folks too. I do tend to be picky about the cis men I connect with, but I'm not opposed. Just please approach me with a message that actually shows you read this post, and DO NOT bring up, or even imply anything that is NSFW, otherwise I will block you! This act is meant to be platonic in nature. 

Anyways! I look forward to hearing from some people!

Also, to help show me you've read this post, please tell me your favourite types of music!",2,1756935935.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1n7rz0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n7rz0t/a_closet_appeared_in_the_woods_i_smoke_at_its/,A closet appeared in the woods I smoke at.  It‚Äôs getting closer to my house.,"I need someone to see this and believe me.¬† I have called the police multiple times, and I have had friends check it out with me, but no one will or can do anything about it.¬† Not now.¬† I‚Äôm at the end of my rope, and I just need to know it‚Äôll all be ok.¬† Let me explain my situation as clearly as possible, and then perhaps someone can help me before it's too late.

I live on the outskirts of Roanoke, Virginia, just on the cusp of the Appalachian rainforest.¬† Like anyone lucky enough to live so close to a natural wonder, I go on weekends to camp and smoke in the forest.¬† After a long week of working a soul-crushing remote job doing nothing all week, the forest has been a haven for me to recharge.¬† This has been a part of my routine for several years now.¬† I go to the same abandoned campsite and stay overnight, cooking while high and loving every second I am away from it all.¬† I knew this spot intimately.¬† I knew where to get the best view, the best spot for my fire, the perfect patch of soft foliage for my sleeping bag, everything.¬† Never in all my years visiting this site did I notice anything peculiar or out of the ordinary, until earlier this month.¬†¬†

After enjoying several rounds of campfire hot dogs and generous amounts of weed, I decided to stand on the scenic cliffside and enjoy the evening breeze.¬† High as a kite, like the loser I am, I stood on the precipice of the cliff, feeling the wind on my face.¬† When I turned around, I almost jolted right off the cliff.¬† Just outside the light of my fire, poking out of the treeline, was a doorway.¬† Its silhouette jutting out of a bush, it faced me.¬†¬†

I stood petrified, convincing myself for several moments that I was high and could just be seeing things.¬† Bracing myself, I slowly approached the campfire, hoping that the more I stared at it, the quicker it would disperse, a simple illusion of the light on my inebriated mind.¬† It did not.¬† Fully protected in the warmth of the bonfire, I stood waiting.¬† For what, I have no idea.¬† Perhaps I hoped it would leave as easily as it came.¬† My anxiety, fueled by weed, began to blur my head with a suffocating dread.¬†¬†

Several more minutes passed before I finally decided to investigate.¬† I pulled out my LED flashlight from my camping supplies and forced my feet to approach the pair of doors protruding from the bush.¬† The forest darkness enveloped it until I flicked my light on.¬† Fully exposed, I examined it from multiple feet away.¬†¬†

It looked like a closet door.¬† The pair of simple oak doors was coated in a clean layer of white paint, unmarred by the surrounding forest.¬† The doorframe itself, also a white trim, twinkled with the 2 sets of bronze door hinges, pristine as the day they were made.¬†¬†

The modest design was unsettlingly modern for a mountain range riddled with the bones of century-old settlements, many I passed on my weekly adventure.¬† An anxiety that was impossible to pin down ravaged me as I begged my body to sober up quickly.¬† Instead, my curiosity took over.¬† Rationally now, I understand that, at that moment, there was nothing inherently menacing about a pair of doors in the woods.¬† But if I knew then what I do now, then I never would have gone near them.¬†

I stepped closer, light fixated on the closet, fully expecting a beast to jump screeching out of it like some childhood nightmare.¬† However, only the crunch of leaves under my boots echoed through the wood, even as I placed my hand on the knob.¬† With a smooth click, I turned the knob, and gracefully the left door opened, without a sound.¬† Nothing but the treeline greeted me on the other side.¬†¬†

The relief was a high in and of itself.¬† The tension calmed as I caught my breath.¬† Fear dispelled, curiosity was all that remained.¬† Like a dolt, I played archaeologist and spent the rest of the night examining every inch of the closet.¬† The bizarre appearance still tainted my mood with a sense of foreboding that I couldn't shake, but it didn't stop me from running my fingers all along the doors and trim, trying to find any sign of weathering.¬† Still, no signs of age, let alone deterioration.¬†¬†

Fully analyzed, or as well as it could be considering my current state of mind, I snuggly packed myself away into my sleeping bag, ensuring the fire was fed enough to last a couple more hours without me.¬† I lay, facing the closet, its presence prodding out of the bushes.¬† Needless to say, it took me a while to fall asleep.¬† It stood stoically, its mint condition paint revealed by the crackling campfire.¬† Sleep came, along with a sober mind that reassured me that my horrible habit wholly caused my paranoia.¬† It definitely was a wake-up call to reexamine my smoking.¬†¬†

In the morning, I blurrily stumbled about packing my campsite, the lack of sleep weighing me down.¬† It stood all the while, completely revealed in the daylight.¬† Its immaculate condition was vibrant and visible.¬† With a final glance, I looked it over before shaking my head in disbelief and beginning my journey home.¬† Another week came and went, work hazing by and chores done here and there, and then, the weekend returned.¬†¬†

After a hesitant decision, I decided I wasn‚Äôt going to let last week's abnormal visitor keep me away from my relaxing routine.¬† The drive to the mountain trail was‚Ä¶ tense.¬† That foreboding had remained nestled in my mind, waiting for this moment to come, and it returned loudly to the forefront of my thoughts.¬† Reaching the parking lot, just below the trail, I took a deep breath and put the car in park, trying to will my anxiety away as a childish notion.¬† Unloading my pack, I began up to my hidden campsite; it was still early afternoon.¬† As I made my way up, I took my usual turn off-trail when I almost lunged backward.¬† My heart punched my ribcage as I regained my balance.¬† The closet was standing in the middle of the path.¬†¬†

I stared at it, disbelief painting my face.¬† It was the very same one.¬† Same coat of white paint, same bronze hinges, same trim and doors.¬† As polished and clean as the first night I saw it.¬† I stepped closer to feel it, the familiar grooves confirming this was, for certain, the same closet.¬† Walking around it gave me no answers; there were no signs of drag marks, no footsteps indicating it had been carried.¬† No evidence for how it got here.¬† With what little curiosity I had left, I reached gingerly for the doorknob.¬† An attempted twist was met with firm resistance.¬† The closet was now locked.¬† A cold sweat broke over me as I twisted the handle desperately, shaking the door with each try.¬†¬†

Firmly, it remained locked.¬† I can‚Äôt describe the reasoning; all I know is that this filled me with a coldness I couldn‚Äôt shake.¬† My sweaty palm released the knob, heart aching as it continued racing.¬† I didn‚Äôt want to be there anymore.¬† Even though my camp was another mile away from it, I didn‚Äôt want to be in the woods anymore.¬† I tore back down the trail, head aching with a palpitating fear.¬†¬†¬†¬†

Throwing my pack into my car, I drove home.¬† Almost an entire day down the drain, this would have irked me under normal circumstances.¬† Instead, I sped home with the desire to lock myself away and spend the remainder of the night binge-watching TV.¬† I ached for distraction as I pulled into my driveway.¬† Immediately, I tossed my pack onto the floor and pulled out a bottle of vodka from the freezer.¬† Drinking and TV, that was the cure I needed, the relief from this underlying nervousness.¬†¬†

Hungover the next day, I decided to plan a different type of trip the following weekend.¬† I called a friend, inviting them out for a quick camp session.¬† My friend Vince was free.¬† I told him all about the closet and planned on showing him as well.¬† Talking it over eased a lot of my worries; the presence of someone genuinely interested in seeing it deterred most of the more menacing aspects of the situation.¬†

Distracted most of the work week, I pressed into another weekend.¬† A rekindled anxiety gripped me.¬† Picking up Vince and joking through the car ride helped immensely, but it remained burrowed in the back of my mind. ¬† We pulled up and, after grabbing all our gear, began the trudge up to my secret spot.¬† Vince distracted me with observations on the natural beauty of the forest and exclamations about how excited he was to finally see not only my hidden campsite, but a mysterious anomaly he joked was straight out of an *X Files* episode.

Fully expecting to run into the closet on the way up, I was shocked to reach the campsite without spotting it.¬† Vince shared his disappointment that I tried to feign in response, but the relief flowing through my system was obvious.¬† So, an uneventful good time filled the night, then, after the most restful night I had had all week, I woke to a gorgeous dawn.¬† With a taste of relief still in my mouth, I packed up the site, letting Vince sleep in a bit as a sign of gratitude.¬† When he woke, we pulled on our gear and laughed our way down the mountain.¬† The drive was pleasant, crisp morning air filling the car.¬† With a huge thank you, I dropped Vince off and resumed my drive home.¬† The veins of the Applaichan forest trail along the highway basically up to my doorstep, which I peacefully glanced at as I finished the last portion of my journey, when something caught my eye.¬† Breaks in the treeline I drove by showed glimmers of it as I slowed down.¬† A rising nervousness spilled from my stomach as I pulled to the side of the road.¬†¬†

Shakily, I stepped out of my car and gazed down into the forest several yards away, trying to find another breakage I could see through.¬† A gap between a huddle of trees guided my eyes into the clearing just past them.¬† There it stood.¬† The shadows of the wood were incapable of hiding the white of the closet.¬† It sat squarely facing me.¬† My breath caught in my throat as I peered at it.¬†

Even from that distance, I could see.¬† One of the doors was cracked open.¬† Fists clenched, I stood frozen, enraptured by its foreboding presence.¬† A minute or so passed.¬† Then, the door shut.¬† I bolted to my car and tore down the highway, desperate for the safety of my home.¬†

The urge to call some form of law enforcement, or maybe the local rangers of the trails, filled my head as I began to spiral.¬† I needed answers, I wanted security.¬† I never wanted to see those closet doors again.¬† I could barely look at my own anymore.¬† Every night, I stared down the foot of my bed at them, expecting them to congeal and morph into the pair from the woods. My otherwise plain oak closet stood innocently as my mind played tricks on me.¬† Did the doors just turn white? Were my hinges turning bronze?¬† No, they stood, their plain oak held in place with metal hinges.¬†¬†

¬†I have been sleeping on my living room couch for a couple of nights now.¬† No matter how childish I felt, I just couldn‚Äôt stop psyching myself out.¬† Working from home helped in the sense that I didn‚Äôt spend every morning driving while in a state of borderline hallucination, expecting the closet to appear in my rearview mirror.¬† My fridge was stocked too, but I knew I could only go a couple more days pushing off going outside.¬†¬†

Finally, the day came when I had to step out.¬† Like an idiot, I pushed it off so last-minute that it was well into the evening when I decided I couldn‚Äôt survive off a dwindling supply of snack foods anymore.¬† I spent several minutes in front of my door, desperately trying to numb my nerves by ridiculing my pathetic behavior.¬† With a forced speed, I opened my door and marched willfully to my car.¬† My eyes remained fixed on my car; no glances into the nearby treeline were allowed.¬† Slamming shut into the safety of my car allowed a moment of relief as I buckled in and drove down the driveway.¬†¬†

I deeply resented my local grocery store for being in the direction of the mountain trail, but I pressed on, eyes glued to the road.¬† I got my supplies and began my journey home without a hitch.¬† I could breathe easier as I turned down the familiar side roads back onto the highway, forest cusping all sides of me still.¬† I passed the last sighting of the closet, and with newfound courage, I dared a passing glance as I zipped down the highway.¬† I recognized the breaks in the treeline, but there was no closet to be seen.¬† No white monolith staring back at me.¬†¬†

I finished the drive with high spirits, listening to music on an otherwise solemn drive.¬† I turned back into my neighborhood, enjoying the blur of green trees caught in my headlights as I slowed.¬† A blob of white interrupted the passing emerald colors.¬† I slammed on my brakes, bags of groceries spilling in my backseat.¬†¬†

The night around me began to feel suffocating, blackness surrounding my car.¬† Stomach aching with the rising bile of fear, I glanced in my rearview.¬† My red brake lights illuminated the daunting closet, just barely visible behind a pair of withered trees.¬† It‚Äôs bronze hinges glinting in the crimson light, door cracked open.¬† I stared, too afraid to blink as I shivered in my car, throat choking down the quivering horror my stomach demanded to release.¬† I saw it in the closet; my eyes stung.¬† A hand was gripping the side of the left door from inside.¬† Just as I registered it, it pulled quickly back inside, slamming the closet shut.¬†¬†

A panic polluted my lungs, and I slammed on the gas.¬† Pulling into my driveway, nearly crashing into my home, I ran inside and began to dial 911.¬† I was in hysterics, I‚Äôm surprised the cops even showed up, considering my raspy voice gagging for air between sentences.¬† My shaking remained when they pulled in fourty minutes later, and continued as I pointed in the general direction I saw the closet in the woods.¬† I told them a man was following me, hoping that would spark more determination in the officers scanning the scattered veins of forest around the neighborhood‚Äôs entrance.¬†¬†

Nothing came of it.¬† No signs of a man, let alone an anomaly like a closet sitting solemnly in the middle of nowhere.¬† I apologized and saw the police officers off, too numb and exhausted to heed whatever advice they gave me.¬† I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to enter my bedroom, so I slept in my clothes on the couch, TV and lamp light on all the while.¬†¬†

The weekend dawn came and went.¬† Saturday was here, and no camping was to be done.¬† I did eventually gather my groceries from the car.¬† Thankfully, the cold Appalachian fall nights kept most of the frozen stuff in a salvageable state.¬† Once again, I holed up in my home, trying to distract myself, smoking and drinking.¬† I had the curtains drawn all day.¬† I couldn‚Äôt stand looking out towards the woods.¬† By nightfall, I was beyond intoxicated, barely conscious as I lay on the couch watching TV.¬† Getting up to pee, I stumbled past the living room window, balancing myself with the curtain.¬† It shifted with me, and my drunken walking corpse couldn‚Äôt rebalance in time.¬† I tumbled to the hardwood floor, nearly bashing my head on the coffee table in the process.¬† With a clang, the curtain rod came down with me.¬†

Grunting, I pulled myself up, curtain still in hand.¬† My head throbbed as the abuse I had put my body through came rushing in all at once.¬† Rubbing my knee, I hobbled back to the couch and plopped down like the defeated sack of meat I was.¬† Returning my attention to my aching temples, I began rubbing them as I turned toward the scene of the tumble to see if anything besides the curtain had been damaged.¬† I slight dent in the wall from my elbow, and a bent curtain rod.¬† I realigned my sight to the window, hoping I hadn‚Äôt cracked it.¬†¬†

The window remained intact, revealing the long stretch of lawn outside, lit by my back porch light as it flickered the last of its life away.¬† The dying illumination revealed something else.¬† In the woods just past my property line.¬†¬†

It stared at me from the treeline.¬† Squarely facing me from the shadows.¬† That closet.¬† My scream winded me as I jumped from my couch.¬† My porch light died.¬† Black night pressed against my window, stifling all sight beyond those panes.¬† I ran to my doors, locking them, before running back to my window and pathetically attempted to fix the curtain.¬† The cheap aluminum rod was too bent to fit, and one of the hooks had been pulled out of the wall.¬† On the brink of tears, I pleadingly, tried to cover the window with a single dangling curtain.¬† My porch light flickered on for a second more, its last gasp at life.¬†¬†

In the blink of an eye, I saw the closet on my lawn, before darkness hid it once again.¬† A moan of horror and defeat gasped from my throat.¬† Grabbing my phone, I tore to my room, locked the door behind me, and pulled the curtains shut before dragging my dresser in front of the window.¬† Another 911 call, promises of them being there soon.¬†¬†

That was twenty minutes ago.¬† I‚Äôve been hiding here all this time, hoping that writing this whole experience down on my phone would keep me sane for just a few more minutes.¬† And that someone out there will know how to help me.¬†¬†

I think I hear someone knocking on my front door now.¬† It's still locked.¬† And I can‚Äôt answer it.¬† I‚Äôve been in the corner of my bedroom for the last ten minutes.¬† The closet is in my room now.¬† I blinked one moment, and it had replaced my closet entirely.¬† The smooth click of its doorknob echoed in the room.¬† It's been creaking open ever since.¬† Centimeters at a time every couple of seconds.¬† Please, someone, believe me and help me.¬† Before it's too late.¬†¬†

I see its hand now, gripping the side of the door.¬† Its rotting flesh perfectly contrasting with the pristine wood of the closet.¬† Please, someone, help me.¬†",6,1756935904.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all.

1n7rsjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CommercialRealEstate/comments/1n7rsjk/icsc_florida_2025_owneroperator_recap_long_post/,"ICSC Florida 2025 ‚Äì Owner/Operator Recap (Long Post, Lots of Data)","Just got back from ICSC Florida in Orlando and figured I‚Äôd share my takeaways for anyone in leasing, acquisitions, capital markets, or just curious about retail. I‚Äôve been going since 2001 (missed only one year when I was on sabbatical), and this year was one of the more interesting ones.

# Market Sentiment

* 2025 feels stronger than 2024 across the board: **leasing, investment sales, capital raising, and overall deal velocity.**
* Retailers are still expanding aggressively. Recent bankruptcies (Big Lots, Jo-Ann, Party City, etc.) actually created opportunities ‚Äî those spaces backfilled almost instantly.
* Despite all the negative press, the mood in the halls was positive.

# Leasing & Occupancy

* 2024‚Äôs issue: **centers were too full.** Vacancy was \~3% (lowest in decades). Leasing teams joked about ‚Äúleasing themselves out of a job.‚Äù
* Vacancies ticked up a bit this year (\~3.5%), but still extremely low by historical standards (pre-COVID ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was 4‚Äì4.5%).
* Very little new supply under construction ‚Üí rents holding firm.

# Investment Sales & Capital Markets

* Deals are flowing again. **Cap rates ticked up, interest rates edged down**, so transactions make sense.
* Equity groups are raising serious money (hundreds of millions per fund) to target grocery-anchored and strip centers.
* Debt markets are open: banks, life co‚Äôs, credit unions, CMBS, and even private long-term lenders. Many said they‚Äôre underweight retail and want exposure.
* I asked lenders about REO retail ‚Äî basically none. Compare that to apartments or office.

# Retailer Mix

* **200+ retailer concepts represented.** Nearly half were food & beverage:
   * 30 QSRs
   * 20 full-service
   * 20 coffee concepts
   * 20 fast casual
* Service categories (fitness, daycare, beauty, entertainment) also strong.
* Example of growth: **Seven Brew Coffee** (Blackstone-backed) went from 15 units in 2021 to 500 today.

# Attendees

* **4,139 people / \~800 companies.**
* Breakdown: 200+ retailers, 290 landlords, 51 investment sales firms, 28 tech firms, 230 vendors, 21 banks.
* 60% from Florida, 40% from out of state (top feeders: GA, NY, TX, NC, CA, OH).
* 150 students (big jump from 2018). UF sent 57 ‚Äî impressive pipeline.

# 2018 vs. 2025

* Attendance dropped \~15% (4,950 ‚Üí 4,139), but quality went up. 45% of attendees were VP+ vs. 37% in 2018.
* More retailer concepts today (200+ vs. 175).
* 28% of attendees were at both conferences. Of those, 40% got promoted over the 7 years.
* Tech presence has exploded ‚Äî AI/data companies everywhere.

# Challenges

* **Permitting delays** are brutal. Pre-COVID, average tenant buildout/opening was 4‚Äì6 months. Now it‚Äôs 9‚Äì12. That‚Äôs millions in delayed revenue/jobs.
* Programming felt lighter than past years ‚Äî fewer keynotes/economists.

# Personal Tips for ICSC

* **Golden hours**: 30 min before doors open and last hour of the day = best convos.
* **Hybrid scheduling**: 6‚Äì8 locked meetings + leave the rest open. Produced more real connections than overbooking.
* **Follow-up system**: badge photo + note (Evernote) ‚Üí easier CRM input later.

# Big Picture

Retail is not only alive ‚Äî it‚Äôs thriving in strip centers and grocery-anchored. Supply is constrained, fundamentals are strong, and capital is chasing the space. Execution at the **local store level** (management, merchandising, customer experience) remains the differentiator.

Curious what others here think:

* Did you see the same level of optimism?
* Are permitting delays as bad in your markets as we‚Äôre seeing in Florida?

1n7rpli,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1n7rpli/i_got_my_high_school_girlfriend_pregnant_this_is/,"I got my high school girlfriend pregnant, this is how it is going. Any advice?","
Hey guys, I need some advice. I 21 (M) have been with this girl 20 (F) for 3 years. We met at the ripe ages of 16-17. For a little background, neither of us had been in a real relationship before this. So when we first met it felt magical and exciting. So let me start from the first year we were together. The first couple of months we were together were hell, she lied to me (about another guy) and used me. We stopped talking and she came back, stupidly I took her back because I thought she had changed. She then got kicked out of her parent‚Äôs house a month later, I felt responsible for this and helped her. ( her parents were very mentally/physically abusive)  she moved in with her sister (single mother of 4 with all different fathers). Obviously this wasn‚Äôt going to be without a cost so I helped her get a job and pay her rent. She did not have anything when she got kicked out so I got her clothes/a bed/ a tv!/ but most importantly a shoulder to cry on and someone to make her feel safe. I did love this girl, or was I just attached? I have never had a close relationship with anyone, I have always been alone, so when this girl came along it felt like she was the one. Was I young and stupid? All I ever did for this girl was provide a loving companion. 

Throughout this first year she continued to lie to me and use me (after she got kicked out) she would talk badly about me to her sisters (she has 7 siblings), do things I asked her not to do (drink/talk to guys/ dress provocatively) was I being over controlling? In my defense I had a reason not to trust her after what she had did to me. This all happened oct 2022- march 2023. May 2023 she had moved into my house with my parents. My parents were kind enough to see what this girl had gone through and let her into our home. 

From here we had stopped working the minimum wage job we had for ourselves. I got a more prestigious job an hour away which kept me out from 5am to 8pm. She stayed at home. I understand how she must have felt with everything happening so fast (leaving her siblings and parents behind) we only lived 8 minutes from her parents house but the initial 6-8 months her parents did not speak to us. She must have felt so sad and lonely, but she never communicated this with me and kept a smile on. I was stressed from the long hours I was working but never put that onto her. I would always show up with presents or maybe a night out the both of us. I thought things were getting better but the small things that were affecting me like the past and present problems ( she would never clean up those 15 hours I was gone and never had a cooked meal for me when I got home so things were always a disaster when I got home after a long ass day of work. I would work close to 60 hours a week)  these things would always pester me and I would always communicate this but she would always just respond with an excuse or somehow blame me, so I stayed quiet.

 This went one until our big fight in September 2023. We were in a bad state. We often had unprotected sex from the beginning of our relationship but never had a pregnancy scare or anything of the sort. September 29th, she told me she was pregnant. This obviously changed things, I wasn‚Äôt unhappy with the news but as if a new light came on me. I was excited to start a new with this girl and add another to our roster. (Fast forward a year- she told me she meant to get pregnant with my child so I would love her again)

2024- I got a new job that gave me more freedom to be with my family,  but still able to sustain my family and work towards the future. On the other hand- she did not seem to be getting any better with her mentality or actions. The thing with her is after growing up in a toxic and negative environment her entire life she is a die hard pessimist( I am a naive optimist). She does not believe she has the capabilities to do anything her self or to pursue something new. I tried helping her with this by showing her new hobbies and things we could do/learn together. To me, I was being the loving husband she needed, comforting her, being romantic, bringing her presents, cooking for her majority of the time, helping her keep things tidy but nothing ever was enough for her. She spent 8+ hours on her phone everyday and did not do anything, she would then complain that she didn‚Äôt feel well. This would obviously frustrate me because she wasn‚Äôt making any effort into our relationship or her well being ( keep in mind she was pregnant at this time) we then got the news that our daughter needed open heart surgery at birth to prevent her from dying. She was born with a rare condition called TGA. This hit me and our family hard and created a more tense environment. I kept my head high and kept working towards our future family because I knew everything was going to work out. As for her she kept in her little bubble. I did not pressure her with any responsibilities because I knew she had already been through a lot along with pregnancy. I took everything on from providing her safe space and keeping everything functional at home. 

May 2024 our beautiful baby girl was born. She was in the PICU/NICU for a month but came out healthy as ever which I am very grateful for.  This was a sigh of relief for all of us. 2-3 months in were great but then she started to neglect her responsibilities pumping/producing milk for our baby. I am against using synthetic formula as it is not as nutritious and contains unknown ingredients which I did not want to feed my baby. This created a huge argument between us but at the end she got her way, what was I supposed to do? She just ended up blaming me and not taking accountability because it hurt her and it was hard. She told me I wasn‚Äôt a woman so I wouldn‚Äôt understand. So after 3 months of pumping for our baby with a heart condition she gave up because it was to hard. Since then we have had our arguments about her not being responsible around the house and not doing what she is supposed to and her being on her phone/tiktok for 8 hours+.  

2025- I realized that telling her what to do wasn‚Äôt going to help anything so instead I started to incorporate new things into our lifestyle that may motivate her. We started going to the gym, waking up early and having a routine, reading books, gardening, getting her supplies for new hobbies she wanted to try out. Yet non of my efforts did any good, she did not change one bit- I felt like I was going crazy, what I was supposed to do for the sake of my future family and child? This all happened before may- before our babies first birthday. Now it has gotten to a point where she doesn‚Äôt cook the babies food until she is crying with hunger. My mom has noticed this pattern and started making baby food an hour before she is to eat so the baby wouldn‚Äôt be neglected like that, she also fails to spend any quality time with her because she is so ‚Äúbusy‚Äù ( she is still spending 6-7 hours on her phone daily.) our baby is behind on her milestones because of this and she has admitted that not until this point she has put any effort into having 1:1 time with her. ( I have recordings of her saying these things for my own protection) 

 So guys, I seriously feel stuck. I am not trying to picture myself as the saint here, but I have never done anything to hurt this girl or make her feel less of herself. It feels like I am always talking to a brick wall and if the conversation ever goes to her saying how she feels it is just her blaming me for how she feels and for the way she does things. I feel like I have put in the effort, whenever she asks my to buy her something or take her somewhere I do and have. I think by doing these things will make her feel better. We are not poor but also not rich. We are well off- so non of us are missing anything materialistic to fill that void society has implemented in us. Whenever she starts a normal conversation with me it‚Äôs just about what she saw on TikTok and that she wants me to buy her something. This has been the only thing she ever talks about and it drives me crazy because she never has enough. On the other hand I try and bring excitement by taking our family on a date to the park or to get coffee,bowling, hiking things that she likes doing to show that I still care but I never get anything back. And I don‚Äôt expect anything in return but a responsible and happy wife, that‚Äôs all I ask for. 

These past couple of months have been the worst because I have lost all patience with her,I do not give into her wants (going out and spending money is the only thing she finds joy in) and do not sugarcoat my words anymore. I have tried to implement more date nights but still no reciprocation.  I tell her what needs to be done and expect them to be done when I get home. I thought maybe this would open her eyes a little more but it has done the opposite. She is more angry nowadays and has a terrible attitude towards everything. She tells me she doesn‚Äôt have time to spend with the baby and get everything she needs to get done, but always have 5+ hours on her phone. This makes no sense to me but when I bring it up to her she just justifies her actions and takes 0 accountability. She is now threatening me that she is going to leave with the baby back to her parents. I do not want my child growing up in an environment like that. 
Like I mentioned, I have recorded some of our conversations of her admitting these things and her actions for my own sake, because if something to were happen who would believe the man/father? 
Guys what do I do? Am I fuckdd? Did I make a poor decision? Am I in the wrong? Am I bad person? Where did I go wrong in the formation of this relationship? Is it my job to try and fix things for her? 

It feels like I have tried everything to make our relationship fun and exciting again like it used to be but nothing seems to fix it. She tells me I don‚Äôt talk to her enough but when I do it just turns to her asking me to buy her something and that‚Äôs just such a turn off. ",0,1756935272.0,AskMenAdvice,17,0.5,False

Life always has a way of humbling you.

After a messy breakup last year, I did what a lot of heartbroken twenty-somethings do: I downloaded the dating apps, met some guys my age, and fell into a casual hook‚Äëup with someone who could‚Äôve been my dad. He was nearly twice my age, smart, confident, the kind of man who orders wine without looking at the menu. What started as me scratching an itch turned into something unexpected ‚Äì it felt safe. He listened when I talked about my career, he asked me what I wanted out of life, he didn‚Äôt make me feel small for not having it all figured out. It was supposed to be one night. It wasn‚Äôt.

We slept together. There‚Äôs no salacious detail to share because that‚Äôs not the point. The point is that the intimacy forced me to confront the fact that I had been chasing approval from boys who only pretended to be men. He showed me what respect looks like, what true attentiveness feels like. It was jarring. That night didn‚Äôt magically heal me, but it did reset my compass. It made me stop settling for crumbs.

Two weeks later, as clich√© as it sounds, I met someone at my favourite coffee shop. He‚Äôs my age, lives in the same messy flatting situation I do, doesn‚Äôt own fancy suits or expensive watches. We talked about books and travel and how we both hate coriander. I probably wouldn‚Äôt have given him a second glance if I hadn‚Äôt just come off that experience. But that encounter with the older man made me realise I deserved to be loved fully, not half‚Äëheartedly. So I let my guard down. I took a risk on someone who wasn‚Äôt on my usual radar because I knew what it felt like to be seen, and I wanted to feel that again without the baggage of a huge age gap.

Fast forward to now, and I‚Äôm in a relationship with the coffee shop guy. We‚Äôre equal parts messy and madly in love. I don‚Äôt regret sleeping with someone older. It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúdaddy issues‚Äù or desperation; it was curiosity that evolved into an unexpected life lesson. It taught me to stop apologising for my desires and to demand more than bare minimum effort from partners.

I know people will judge me. That‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm sharing this because there‚Äôs always someone out there who thinks they‚Äôve ruined their chance at a ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship because of a wild decision. You haven‚Äôt. Your past doesn‚Äôt dictate your future. Sometimes the mistakes, the taboo experiences, the things we swear we‚Äôll never do are the very things that shove us onto the path we were meant to take.

So yeah. I slept with a man who was old enough to be my father. It made me realise what I wanted, and shortly after, I found the love of my life. Life is weird like that.",0,1756935078.0,confessions,2,0.5,False

1n7rlxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1n7rlxh/i_went_camping_with_my_friend_we_found_something/,I Went Camping with My Friend. We Found Something That Shouldn‚Äôt Have Been in the Woods.,"I don‚Äôt want sympathy. I‚Äôm not looking for theories about sleep deprivation or campfire smoke messing with my head.

I just want someone to tell me I‚Äôm not crazy.

Because I know what I heard in those trees. I know what I saw just outside the firelight. I know what it left behind.

You can say I‚Äôm mistaken. That‚Äôs fine.

Just don‚Äôt tell me it wasn‚Äôt real.

It was my friend Marcus‚Äôs idea. It‚Äôs always Marcus‚Äôs idea‚Äîwinter hikes, off-trail shortcuts, rafting when the river advisories say don‚Äôt. I usually give him a hard time and go anyway. But this time I pushed back more than usual.

‚ÄúWhere is it?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúOld service road, maybe an hour off the highway.‚Äù He was scrolling on his phone, showing me a satellite view. A smear of green, a thin silver line, and then nothing‚Äîno campsites, no picnic icons, no little tent symbol. ‚ÄúGuy on a hunting forum flagged a clearing way out past the marked trails. Said it was quiet. No trash. No sign anyone‚Äôs camped there in years.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs posted?‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúLand management map says public. Nobody‚Äôs going to be out there.‚Äù

I should‚Äôve said no.

We left early Friday‚Äîtents, water filters, a hatchet, lanterns, my old Polaroid camera because I liked the way photos feel when they develop in your hand. The truck rattled up a rutted road and died in a patch of gravel and weeds. Past that, the trees closed in. No cell service. No noise from the highway. Just us.

We cut through knee-high ferns and ankle-grabbing roots, worked our way deeper, and deeper, until the forest swallowed the ribbon of sky behind us. Marcus checked his grandfather‚Äôs brass compass every twenty minutes, tapping the glass like it would balk if he didn‚Äôt remind it of north. He had flagging tape‚Äîbright orange‚Äîlooped around his wrist. Every hundred yards he tied a strip to a branch.

‚ÄúBelt and suspenders,‚Äù he said, nodding at the compass and the tape. ‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs getting lost.‚Äù

Four hours later, we reached the clearing.

It was bigger than I expected. Not a meadow‚Äînothing as soft as that‚Äîbut a broad circle of flattened grass surrounded by tall pines and black spruce. The ground sat strangely level, like someone had shaved the ridge and pressed it flat with a giant hand. No fire rings. No bottle caps. Not even old ash kicked into dirt. The place felt untouched.

And very, very quiet.

No wind. No birds. Not even the invisible hiss of insects that usually fills the spaces between trees. It felt like the forest had paused mid-breath to listen.

‚ÄúFeels dead,‚Äù I said.

Marcus grinned. ‚ÄúFeels perfect.‚Äù

We set camp at the edge of the circle‚Äîtwo tents, a low fire pit scraped to mineral soil, food hung in a bear bag high on a limb. The light slid down the trunks and pooled at the base of the trees until it all went the color of copper. I snapped a Polaroid of the clearing‚Äîthe pale grass, the two tents, the orange tape flickering on the perimeter like desperate little flags‚Äîand tucked the picture warm into my jacket pocket.

We ate beans and jerky cross-legged by the fire. Marcus told a story about his grandfather giving him the compass and telling him never to trust a trail that looks too easy.

‚ÄúLike this one?‚Äù I asked, nodding toward the opening we‚Äôd carved into the brush.

He poked the fire. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a trail.‚Äù

The shadows stretched thin and long. The trees‚Äô silhouettes leaned over us until the circle of sky was a coin you could cover with your palm. I tried to name constellations. They seemed wrong. Shifted. The stars looked too sharp, like points punched through a black sheet.

When the fire burned down to heart-coals, we crawled into our tents. The nylon mushed the world into soft shapes and softer sounds. The zipper teeth muttered closed. I lay on my back and watched my breath fog the beam of my headlamp.

Sometime after midnight, I woke to a sound.

Not twigs popping. Not the light patter of a deer stepping cautious through brush.

Breathing.

Slow. Heavy. In and out, like bellows. Not close, not far. Just past the reach of the firelight, where the clearing pressed against the dark. It paced, measured, circling. The breaths didn‚Äôt match the rhythm of mine. They didn‚Äôt match Marcus‚Äôs, either; I could hear his soft, regular snore through the fabric. This was deeper. Deliberate. Something that enjoyed the drag of air.

Then the scrape.

Not on rocks. On bark. The long whisper of something hard and pointed drawn down a trunk. A pause. Another trunk. Another pause. Around us.

I held my breath until my chest hurt, until my body insisted on air and I let a little out and drew a little in, trying to move the tent as little as possible.

The breaths went on.

At some point‚Äîwith no sound marking it‚Äîthe air felt different. Thinner. Cleaner. The breathing wasn‚Äôt gone, exactly. It was‚Ä¶ sated. Or amused. Or something I don‚Äôt have a word for.

When I woke again, it was gray morning and my mouth tasted like I‚Äôd been sucking pennies. Marcus had the camp stove going and kept glancing over my shoulder at the trees.

‚ÄúYou hear anything?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúBreathing,‚Äù I said.

He nodded once, like that was an answer he‚Äôd been waiting for and didn‚Äôt like. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll check the treeline after coffee.‚Äù

We followed the orange tape we‚Äôd tied the day before, shaking night from our legs. Fifteen feet into the trees, there were marks on a spruce: four parallel grooves, deep as a thumbnail is wide, scored from shoulder height down to the roots. The cuts were clean. Not bear. Not anything with a claw that tears and splinters. It looked like someone had carved meat from the wood with a blade that wasn‚Äôt smooth.

We found more marks. On three different trunks around the clearing, all at the same height. All pointed inward.

‚ÄúCougar?‚Äù I said, even though I knew that wasn‚Äôt right.

‚ÄúCougars don‚Äôt do that,‚Äù Marcus said. His fingers brushed the grooves and came back with resin shining. Fresh.

We left it. We had a day to fill, and pretending things are normal is an easy way to move your legs. We took the stream trail Marcus swore he‚Äôd seen on a topo map. It wasn‚Äôt a trail, exactly, but it was a depression in the duff that suggested other feet had once passed through. The forest opened a little into a place where light caught in the needles like dust and the water ran in a black vein across stones.

On the opposite bank, I saw them.

Carvings, in a dead oak that leaned over the creek. Dozens, maybe hundreds of little figures razor-cut into the bark, each no bigger than a matchbox. The same symbol over and over: a human shape bent backward so far its spine made a circle. Thin arms extended, thin legs braced, head tipped to the sky or where the sky should be if there weren‚Äôt trees.

Every one of them faced the direction of our clearing.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, pointing.

Marcus stared for a long time. ‚ÄúThose weren‚Äôt here last time.‚Äù

Last time. My skin tightened. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been out here before?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer. He crouched and wetted a handkerchief in the stream, then scrubbed the closest marks. The water ran gray and then pinkish. The carvings had bled; whoever made them had cut through live cambium. He touched the pocket with his compass like he was checking it was still there.

We said very little the rest of the day.

Back at the clearing, we rebuilt the fire and stacked extra wood within reach. I swapped dead batteries for fresh. The first stars blinked through. I took another Polaroid, more to busy my hands than to make a record: tents, fire, Marcus‚Äôs profile in the orange light, the ring of trees beyond.

The smell came just after full dark.

Sweet and wrong. Not garbage, not skunk, not rot exactly. Like fruit syrup that‚Äôs been heated and left to sit until it turns. It moved before the breathing did, a soft ribbon of scent that slipped over the circle, tasting us, then slid back to the black.

Marcus‚Äôs knuckles were white around the haft of the hatchet. ‚ÄúStay put,‚Äù he said, like I was thinking of wandering off.

The breathing started again.

Closer this time. It drew around us like a tide around an island. In and out, slow enough to count. Something scraped wood‚Äîlightly at first, then with pressure, then lightly again, like fingers testing grain.

My lantern stuttered. Not out. Just a slow dimming and brightening like a pulse syncing to the breaths.

The laugh came after.

If you can call it a laugh. Sound shaped wrong. A lung pushing air and catching on something to make it rise at the edges. Amusement without a mouth.

It froze me harder than the breathing.

The shadows at the edge of the clearing leaned; that‚Äôs the only way I can say it. The dark pushed itself closer, not by walking but by sort of reorganizing where it was. The fire had to decide how far it reached, and it chose us and nothing else.

Something stood just beyond that reach.

I saw the outline as a cut in the dark, not because it reflected light but because it refused it. Tall. Much too tall. Arms long and loose at its sides. Shoulders pointed. Ribs like the slats of an old barrel. A head tilted the wrong way, like a listening dog that doesn‚Äôt understand you.

I brought the Polaroid to my face and pressed the shutter.

The flash punched a hole in the night.

When it collapsed back in, the edge of the clearing was empty. The smell thickened.

We didn‚Äôt say a word. We didn‚Äôt sleep. Every noise meant the same thing so words weren‚Äôt useful anymore.

By dawn, mist hung knee-high over the grass. Everything that should have felt like relief just felt like a reprieve.

I checked the Polaroid as we packed.

The clearing wasn‚Äôt there. No trees. No tents. No auras of firelight. The whole frame was a wash of whiteness like snow with no texture. Centered on it‚Äîperfectly centered‚Äîwas a little figure, bent backward into a circle.

Smiling with a mouth thin as a cut.

My first thought was that the camera was broken. But when I lifted it, I could feel the warm square still developing under my thumb. The lens was intact. The shutter had worked, and something had worked back.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving,‚Äù Marcus said. His voice was raw from not talking.

We should have made it back in three hours. It took us nine.

The forest we entered wasn‚Äôt the forest we left. The orange tape we‚Äôd tied on the way in hung in different places‚Äîhigher on some trees, lower on others, and on one trunk it was threaded through a ring of gouges like someone had looped it into a smile. We reached places we didn‚Äôt remember passing and didn‚Äôt reach places we should have hit. The compass needle trembled in a slow circle no matter how often Marcus tapped the glass.

By mid-afternoon, I saw our own footprints in a patch of damp loam where a seep ran across the path. I felt a rush of relief‚Äîproof of a loop we could break if we only turned‚Äîbut when I pressed my boot into the print it didn‚Äôt match. The tread pattern was right. The size was right. But the angle of the heel, the depth of pressure, the place where I scuffed my toe‚Äînone of it lined up with the way I walked. It was like the forest had traced my step wrong, or decided to try wearing it.

We stopped at a low rise to drink. That‚Äôs when I noticed the cairns.

Little stacks of rocks, no higher than my knee, circled the knoll. The top stone on each pile was a thin, flat piece carved with the same figure as the tree‚Äîthe bent spine, the ring, the narrow arms‚Äîscratched with something sharper than a knife. Every cairn faced the direction we were traveling. All of them were new; their bases sat on leaves that hadn‚Äôt browned or curled. One stack had a feather tucked under the top stone. The feather was wet with something sweet and sticky.

Marcus‚Äôs face had gone a strange color. ‚ÄúWe need to step off,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is bad sign.‚Äù He said it like a phrase his grandfather had taught him along with how to hold a compass and how to clean a fish. He cut left, deeper into a tangle of young fir. I followed because going a different way from the only person you came with felt like volunteering to be the lesson the woods wanted to teach.

It got darker in the fir. Sound deadened. Our breath sounded too loud. The air felt warm in a way that wasn‚Äôt temperature. It felt like the woods had been warmed once, long ago, and remembered it now.

We broke out of the fir into another clearing.

Smaller than the first. Oval. The grass here was different‚Äîshorter, slicker, like hair on skin. The trees around it leaned inward a degree or two, enough to notice if you stood still. The sky above it pressed closer than it should.

In the center, there was a ring of wood. Not a structure, not a fence‚Äîjust logs laid end to end in a perfect circle, bark peeled, pale wood exposed. Each log‚Äôs inner face was etched with the same figure as the tree, as the stones, as the Polaroid. On the outside of the circle, in the grass, were little arrangements of things‚Äîbird bones wired together with thin twine, teeth strung like beads, ropes braided of something that looked like fibers and looked like hair.

I didn‚Äôt step into the ring. Every part of me that still believed in being untouched by things like fear and consequences refused all at once.

Marcus edged along the perimeter and crouched. The pale wood wasn‚Äôt dry. It was damp. It smelled sweet.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù he said.

We didn‚Äôt argue about direction anymore. We went away.

The forest let us.

By the time we reached the campsite, the sun was low and the clearing had that orange glow that makes everything it touches seem like a memory of itself. We didn‚Äôt see our tents until we were right at them. They looked‚Ä¶ wrong. A little too tall. A little too narrow. The lines weren‚Äôt exactly the lines we‚Äôd pitched.

The bear bag hung on its limb, fat with food. The knot I‚Äôd used to tie it off was a knot I don‚Äôt know how to tie.

‚ÄúDid you‚Äî‚Äù I started.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Marcus said.

My Polaroid was on my sleeping pad, face down. I hadn‚Äôt left it there. When I turned it over, it was a photo of the clearing, at night, with two figures standing at the edge where the trees begin. They were taller than the trees. They were bent backward in that circle way, arms too long and too slack. Between them, hanging on nothing, was something that might have been a smile.

Our fire pit had been rearranged. Not scattered‚Äîrearranged. The stones were stacked into a ring taller than my calf, maybe twenty inches high. There were marks on the inside of each stone‚Äîburns, but not from fire. Smudges, like something had exhaled on them until they turned black.

‚ÄúPack,‚Äù Marcus said. The word sounded like it hurt to push out. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not staying another night.‚Äù

We moved fast. I shoved the Polaroid under my shirt because my pack felt too far away from my skin. I didn‚Äôt notice right away that the bright strips of orange tape on the perimeter branches were no longer bright. Their color had leeched to a pale, dull peach, like a photo left in the sun.

We should have left then.

We didn‚Äôt.

We were slow because there were more things to look at than our hands. We were slow because we didn‚Äôt want to turn our backs to the trees. We were slow because the world was the size of a circle and there was more outside it than there had been when we walked in.

By the time we had everything in place, the light had dipped into that last band of day when you can pretend you‚Äôre not about to be shut in. The forest‚Äôs quiet had grown teeth.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be worse in the dark,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Marcus said. He said it like he was agreeing with gravity. He swung his pack up. He didn‚Äôt look at me. ‚ÄúGo.‚Äù

We went.

We didn‚Äôt get very far.

The tape we‚Äôd put up wasn‚Äôt ours. It still sat on the branches where we‚Äôd tied it, but the knots were too tight, the tails too even. On one tree, someone had braided the tape into a little rope. On another, the end had been cut clean, not torn, the edges heat-sealed like plastic cut by wire. And on another, the tape hung in two strips like a pair of lips‚Äîone long, one short‚Äîand someone had scratched the bent-back figure into the bark between them where a mouth would be.

We walked faster.

The forest walked with us.

When we stopped to breathe, everything else stopped too.

When we started again, we didn‚Äôt know we had until a branch cracked somewhere to our left and the crack was answered by a crack to our right the same distance away. Like something pacing us at the distance of a thought.

Full dark fell in a way that felt more like being closed in than losing light.

The breathing came immediately.

Not outside us. Around us. The sound didn‚Äôt come from a place; it unrolled like a coil and we were in the center of it. Inhale. Exhale. Slow. Measured. Not the rhythm of an animal moving under its weight and air. The rhythm of something counting.

We kept going because stopping meant choosing a position to die in.

I don‚Äôt know how long we walked. My hands hurt from where nail met skin. My breath made small clouds that turned to black faster than they should.

Somewhere in the middle of that, I realized Marcus wasn‚Äôt beside me.

I turned.

My headlamp picked out trunks and brush and the white flash of the tape. There wasn‚Äôt a sound of me and there wasn‚Äôt a sound of Marcus. The breathing went on like we were nothing in it.

‚ÄúMarcus?‚Äù I said, not loud. That word didn‚Äôt belong in the breathing.

No answer.

‚ÄúMarcus,‚Äù I tried again.

The breathing stopped.

The forest held absolutely still.

Then something in front of me moved that wasn‚Äôt me, wasn‚Äôt wind, wasn‚Äôt anything I have a word for. The dark rearranged itself. My headlamp found two points of pale that weren‚Äôt eyes because there weren‚Äôt eyes there, just the places where eyes would be if something had them and closed them, and above those the suggestion of a forehead and above that too much nothing.

I took a step back and my heel hit a root.

Something brushed my sleeve.

Not a hand. Not fur. The memory of a hand.

I ran.

Branches slapped my face and cut my lips. The tape flashed in little funerals of orange that didn‚Äôt help. My headlamp caught the white flare of exposed wood where something had rubbed bark away and made it smooth. The woods stopped being a place and became lines of dark I had to not run into.

When the breathing stopped again, I fell.

I don‚Äôt remember landing.

I don‚Äôt remember getting up.

I remember crawling. Dirt under my nails. The smell of earth and that other smell, the sweet one that makes you think of sugar and heat and then turns in your throat. I remember a shape in front of me that was lighter than everything else and then cool air on my face and the tight, unsteady miracle of stars.

I was at the edge of a road cut into a hillside. A narrow ditch ran along it. The ditch held a trickle of water and the reflection of my headlamp looked like a startled animal. The road‚Äôs gravel was the most beautiful thing I‚Äôd ever seen.

I don‚Äôt remember how I got back to the truck. The door was open. There was dirt on the seat I don‚Äôt remember dragging in. The keys were in my pocket where I don‚Äôt remember putting them.

I woke up in my apartment two days later. The sheets were muddy. My mouth tasted like I‚Äôd been breathing through metal. My Polaroid camera sat on the kitchen table next to a glass of water I hadn‚Äôt poured. The photo of the clearing with the single bent figure lay under the glass like I‚Äôd put it there to keep it flat.

Marcus‚Äôs pack wasn‚Äôt in my living room. His boots weren‚Äôt by the door. His jokes weren‚Äôt in my head where they should‚Äôve been.

His number was disconnected.

His socials were empty. Not deactivated. Not private. Scrubbed.

The orange tape I‚Äôd tied and retied around my wrist that first day sat on the counter, pale as old scars.

And then someone slid something under my door.

It made a soft whispering sound when it came to a stop. I thought it was junk mail until I saw the knot.

It was a strip of pale leather tied around a bundle of hair.

Hair braided the same way Marcus used to braid his sister‚Äôs hair at her soccer games when she asked him to ‚Äúdo the rope one.‚Äù I recognized the pattern. He‚Äôd shown me once, leaning over a picnic table, laughing at how serious I looked while I tried to copy him.

The braid was cut clean at one end. The cut had been heat-sealed.

There were markings burned into the leather. Not letters I knew. Not any runic alphabet my desperate Googling would later suggest. Little figures in a line, each a perfect version of the one before: the bent body, the ring spine, the praised sky, the long thin limbs.

And on the inside of the leather, pressed into it like someone had used a brand smaller than a thumbnail, were five words in English.

YOU WERE MEANT TO WATCH.

They weren‚Äôt crooked. They weren‚Äôt shaky. They sat straight and clean like something had pressed them one after the other with care.

I stared at the braid so long my vision went white at the edges.

When I blinked and the room came back, the Polaroid camera had moved.

It was closer to me by a few inches. The lens faced my chest. The strap hung off the table like a tongue. I hadn‚Äôt touched it.

I picked it up. My thumb found the shutter because that‚Äôs what hands do when they don‚Äôt know what else to do.

The flash went off in my face. The apartment lit white and then collapsed back into itself.

I put the camera down and waited for the photo to develop.

The square stayed gray longer than it should have. Then an image came up like bruises emerging.

It was the clearing.

Not the way my eyes had ever seen it. The grass was too smooth. The trees leaned in too far. The tents weren‚Äôt tents. The ring of stones around the fire pit was taller and the black on the inside of each was wet.

Two figures stood at the edge of the frame.

They were bent backward into rings. They were taller than the trees. Where their faces should have been were the places for faces. And between them, on nothing, a thin smile hung the way a strip of leather hangs when it‚Äôs been tied and then slipped.

In the bottom right corner, smaller than my thumbnail, a third figure stood between the first two like a child between adults crossing a street.

Its face was Marcus‚Äôs.

I‚Äôm not posting this for attention. I don‚Äôt care if you believe me.

I‚Äôm posting it because sometimes, just before dawn, I hear breathing in my apartment walls. Not mice. Not air through vents. The slow, patient draw of something that likes reminding me it doesn‚Äôt have to hurry.

And because I woke up yesterday with resin on my fingers and four parallel grooves scraped into the wood of my kitchen table at the exact height my shoulder is when I stand there.

And because the Polaroid I left face down on the counter last night was on the floor this morning, and when I turned it over, it was blank white except for a thin ring in the center, burned so lightly into the paper that you only see it if you tilt it to the light.

During my trip to Poland I purchased a reed diffuser (created in collaboration with a woman known for home renovations etc- there's a whole collection). It's simply called Caramel, but the fragrance is so much than this. Upon first opening it, I was pleasantly surprised by an intense note of sweet strong coffee, followed by freshly baked caramel biscuits. 

The official notes are as follows: 

Top notes: Cocoa, Roasted hazelnut

Heart notes: Warm milk, frangipani wood

Base notes: Sweet vanilla, Arabica coffee, Fresh bread


This is strange to me as I'm not a gourmand fan usually; I lean towards floral, fruity and spicy fragrances. But smelling this in my room made me want more than anything to smell like this myself and make people wonder who just baked caramel coffee cookies! 

Any suggestions for a perfume that would match this scent profile?

1n7rjpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThaiBL/comments/1n7rjpa/ranting_and_rating_your_sky/,Ranting and rating Your Sky,"I need to rant about thus series to someone. This is an absolutely amazing series for fluffy BL lovers like me. You get to see actual character development in Teerak and Muenfah. 

Rak begins as this sweet boy who is just a big people pleaser. He has a hard time saying no making himself an easy target. This is seen with Mew and Oh. He just doesn't want to upset people or disappoint them. After he starts ""dating"" Fah. Fah has already noticed this and feels bad for him and genuinely shows Rak that he wants to help him change. We first start seeing this in action when Rak sees Mew on their ""date"" at the zoo. Fah shows genuine concern for Rak and shows Rak he truly wants to help him get better. After that we start to see Rak getting more comfortable saying no. The main part when Oh tries to get Mew to get Rak to date him again and Rak actually says no. And he gets more comfortable throughout the show.

For Fah, he has a hard time expressing his emotions as well as some anger issues causing people to be scared of him. Even just after meeting Rak, you can already see this shift in him. Him smiling when Rak tries to clean the coffee off his shirt and even when the ball almost hit Fahs face. You can see he is just a bit calmer seeing Raks face. I think the main time we start to notice this change though is when Fah is playing soccer and almost beats the shit out of Oh. But if course, Rak remembers Fah just needs to calm down so just simply calling for Fah was enough to calm him down. There's really only one other scene where Fah slips up and that's when Oh is trying to take Rak at the bar and pushes him down. And Fah doesn't want his baby hurt. But he immediately feels bad after Rak calls for him. Another thing is you start to see Fah and Raks friends becoming an ever bigger friend group together. Like originally Joy and Type were scared of not only Fah but also Hia and Real just because they were friends with Fah. But now Hia and Real bring them treats. For example at that project show case. And I just think that goes to show that the 6 of them plus Babe and Dom have grown much closer purely because they aren't scared of Fah anymore and sees him for who he actually is, a real gentleman.

I really wish there was more story for RealHia. I wish we had more of an explanation as to why Real started to fall for Hia and when it started happening. Because they made it seem as if Hia fell for Real first but then Hia was hesitant to even start dating Real. 

Same goes for LeeGhlai/GhlaiLee. I know in the novels they make more sense so I wish they had more of that. But TeePorTee made me really excited for their new upcoming show so. 

Same goes for Magic Lovers. I love ThomasKongs chemistry on and off scene. 

All in all I loved this show, and I wouldn't give it a full 10/10 but still a 9.5/10. This is probably my favorite BL tied with LITA. I could rewatch Your Sky and Your Sky of Us over and over again and wouldn't get bored. 

If you haven't watched Your Sky and Your Sky of Us and you liked fluffy bls with minimal drama, I highly recommend this series. I watched it on IQIYI. 


Oh side note; after watching I found Dexx which is a Thai pop group that consists of TeeTee, Por and Auau and 3 other members. 

I really love Auau, Save, Por, TeeTee, Thomas and Kong like an unhealthy amount- I love seeing AuauSave, TeePorTee and ThomasKong in action. Esp TeeTee calling Por, P'Por...they are all just a bunch of sweeties. ",2,1756934882.0,ThaiBL,5,0.75,False

I requested them to be very honest with me and they said they never felt anything unpleasant. I shared bed with them during my trips in the last two years. But somehow I feel very anxious if I my coworkers feel uncomfortable or something. One of my coworkers comes close to me and talks to me. I‚Äôm doing everything I can like dental cleaning every 4 months, mouth wash, electric toothbrush etc. 
These thoughts are making me scared of dating people as well.

1n7rg2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n7rg2k/i_got_my_high_school_girlfriend_pregnant/,I got my high school girlfriend pregnant,"
Hey guys, I need some advice. I 21 (M) have been with this girl 20 (F) for 3 years. We met at the ripe ages of 16-17. For a little background, neither of us had been in a real relationship before this. So when we first met it felt magical and exciting. So let me start from the first year we were together. The first couple of months we were together were hell, she lied to me (about another guy) and used me. We stopped talking and she came back, stupidly I took her back because I thought she had changed. She then got kicked out of her parent‚Äôs house a month later, I felt responsible for this and helped her. ( her parents were very mentally/physically abusive)  she moved in with her sister (single mother of 4 with all different fathers). Obviously this wasn‚Äôt going to be without a cost so I helped her get a job and pay her rent. She did not have anything when she got kicked out so I got her clothes/a bed/ a tv!/ but most importantly a shoulder to cry on and someone to make her feel safe. I did love this girl, or was I just attached? I have never had a close relationship with anyone, I have always been alone, so when this girl came along it felt like she was the one. Was I young and stupid? All I ever did for this girl was provide a loving companion. 

Throughout this first year she continued to lie to me and use me (after she got kicked out) she would talk badly about me to her sisters (she has 7 siblings), do things I asked her not to do (drink/talk to guys/ dress provocatively) was I being over controlling? In my defense I had a reason not to trust her after what she had did to me. This all happened oct 2022- march 2023. May 2023 she had moved into my house with my parents. My parents were kind enough to see what this girl had gone through and let her into our home. 

From here we had stopped working the minimum wage job we had for ourselves. I got a more prestigious job an hour away which kept me out from 5am to 8pm. She stayed at home. I understand how she must have felt with everything happening so fast (leaving her siblings and parents behind) we only lived 8 minutes from her parents house but the initial 6-8 months her parents did not speak to us. She must have felt so sad and lonely, but she never communicated this with me and kept a smile on. I was stressed from the long hours I was working but never put that onto her. I would always show up with presents or maybe a night out the both of us. I thought things were getting better but the small things that were affecting me like the past and present problems ( she would never clean up those 15 hours I was gone and never had a cooked meal for me when I got home so things were always a disaster when I got home after a long ass day of work. I would work close to 60 hours a week)  these things would always pester me and I would always communicate this but she would always just respond with an excuse or somehow blame me, so I stayed quiet.

 This went one until our big fight in September 2023. We were in a bad state. We often had unprotected sex from the beginning of our relationship but never had a pregnancy scare or anything of the sort. September 29th, she told me she was pregnant. This obviously changed things, I wasn‚Äôt unhappy with the news but as if a new light came on me. I was excited to start a new with this girl and add another to our roster. (Fast forward a year- she told me she meant to get pregnant with my child so I would love her again)

2024- I got a new job that gave me more freedom to be with my family,  but still able to sustain my family and work towards the future. On the other hand- she did not seem to be getting any better with her mentality or actions. The thing with her is after growing up in a toxic and negative environment her entire life she is a die hard pessimist( I am a naive optimist). She does not believe she has the capabilities to do anything her self or to pursue something new. I tried helping her with this by showing her new hobbies and things we could do/learn together. To me, I was being the loving husband she needed, comforting her, being romantic, bringing her presents, cooking for her majority of the time, helping her keep things tidy but nothing ever was enough for her. She spent 8+ hours on her phone everyday and did not do anything, she would then complain that she didn‚Äôt feel well. This would obviously frustrate me because she wasn‚Äôt making any effort into our relationship or her well being ( keep in mind she was pregnant at this time) we then got the news that our daughter needed open heart surgery at birth to prevent her from dying. She was born with a rare condition called TGA. This hit me and our family hard and created a more tense environment. I kept my head high and kept working towards our future family because I knew everything was going to work out. As for her she kept in her little bubble. I did not pressure her with any responsibilities because I knew she had already been through a lot along with pregnancy. I took everything on from providing her safe space and keeping everything functional at home. 

May 2024 our beautiful baby girl was born. She was in the PICU/NICU for a month but came out healthy as ever which I am very grateful for.  This was a sigh of relief for all of us. 2-3 months in were great but then she started to neglect her responsibilities pumping/producing milk for our baby. I am against using synthetic formula as it is not as nutritious and contains unknown ingredients which I did not want to feed my baby. This created a huge argument between us but at the end she got her way, what was I supposed to do? She just ended up blaming me and not taking accountability because it hurt her and it was hard. She told me I wasn‚Äôt a woman so I wouldn‚Äôt understand. So after 3 months of pumping for our baby with a heart condition she gave up because it was to hard. Since then we have had our arguments about her not being responsible around the house and not doing what she is supposed to and her being on her phone/tiktok for 8 hours+.  

2025- I realized that telling her what to do wasn‚Äôt going to help anything so instead I started to incorporate new things into our lifestyle that may motivate her. We started going to the gym, waking up early and having a routine, reading books, gardening, getting her supplies for new hobbies she wanted to try out. Yet non of my efforts did any good, she did not change one bit- I felt like I was going crazy, what I was supposed to do for the sake of my future family and child? This all happened before may- before our babies first birthday. Now it has gotten to a point where she doesn‚Äôt cook the babies food until she is crying with hunger. My mom has noticed this pattern and started making baby food an hour before she is to eat so the baby wouldn‚Äôt be neglected like that, she also fails to spend any quality time with her because she is so ‚Äúbusy‚Äù ( she is still spending 6-7 hours on her phone daily.) our baby is behind on her milestones because of this and she has admitted that not until this point she has put any effort into having 1:1 time with her. ( I have recordings of her saying these things for my own protection) 
 So guys, I seriously feel stuck. I am not trying to picture myself as the saint here, but I have never done anything to hurt this girl or make her feel less of herself. It feels like I am always talking to a brick wall and if the conversation ever goes to her saying how she feels it is just her blaming me for how she feels and for the way she does things. I feel like I have put in the effort, whenever she asks my to buy her something or take her somewhere I do and have. I think by doing these things will make her feel better. We are not poor but also not rich. We are well off- so non of us are missing anything materialistic to fill that void society has implemented in us. Whenever she starts a normal conversation with me it‚Äôs just about what she saw on TikTok and that she wants me to buy her something. This has been the only thing she ever talks about and it drives me crazy because she never has enough. On the other hand I try and bring excitement by taking our family on a date to the park or to get coffee,bowling, hiking things that she likes doing to show that I still care but I never get anything back. And I don‚Äôt expect anything in return but a responsible and happy wife, that‚Äôs all I ask for. 

These past couple of months have been the worst because I have lost all patience with her,I do not give into her wants (going out and spending money is the only thing she finds joy in) and do not sugarcoat my words anymore. I have tried to implement more date nights but still no reciprocation.  I tell her what needs to be done and expect them to be done when I get home. I thought maybe this would open her eyes a little more but it has done the opposite. She is more angry nowadays and has a terrible attitude towards everything. She tells me she doesn‚Äôt have time to spend with the baby and get everything she needs to get done, but always have 5+ hours on her phone. This makes no sense to me but when I bring it up to her she just justifies her actions and takes 0 accountability. She is now threatening me that she is going to leave with the baby back to her parents. I do not want my child growing up in an environment like that. 
Like I mentioned, I have recorded some of our conversations of her admitting these things and her actions for my own sake, because if something to were happen who would believe the man/father? 
Guys what do I do? Am I fuckdd? Did I make a poor decision? Am I bad person? Where did I go wrong in the formation of this relationship? Is it my job to try and fix things for her? 

It feels like I have tried everything to make our relationship fun and exciting again like it used to be but nothing seems to fix it. She tells me I don‚Äôt talk to her enough but when I do it just turns to her asking me to buy her something and that‚Äôs just such a turn off. ",1,1756934639.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

The window showed the moon and stars. Brian is reading a book in the living room with a light on. His face is calm. Brian turned the page, and his face felt a sense of peace. Stewie looks at Brian's face and says, ""Why are you so happy?"" Brian paused and then put down the book. ""I feel still. Like nothing's rattling around up there anymore."" Brian smiles slightly. There is a box next to him, a small brown box under the coffee table. Stewie's eyes locked on the box. asks, ""What's in that box?"" Brian does not look up. ""Just stuff. I need to pack some things."" Stewie snickers. ""Move it, or Peter will use it as a step stool."" 



 



 Brian nudges the box further under the coffee table. The window shows the sun. Stewie is in the kitchen playing around. Lois was at her computer playing her game when an email popped up. It says urgent. Storage at the bank; payments are due now. Huh? Why does Brian have a bank charge? Stewie shrugs. ""Maybe he wants to keep overpriced books in a vault."" Later, in the living room. It is clean-up day, and Brian is going back and forth. Peter is in the closet. And Stewie Peter is digging through the closet. He finds an old gun. ""Guys, look at this random old gun I found!"" Brian glances over and whispers to himself, ""Needs cleaning."" Stewie hears it. And suddenly, it connects. He remembers the time Brian was vulnerable, the time he admitted the gun in the safe was meant for himself, for when life got too har

d. Stewie realizes Brian is planning to leave. And that thought scares him more than he's ready for.  



 



The full moon shines onto the Griffin house. The family is asleep. Only Brian and Stewie were awake. Brian is in the living room again, still reading the same book. Stewie finally gets courage. ""Do you still have the gun, Brian?"" The air disappears from the room. Brian, calm as ever: ""Yes. I still have it."" Questions swirl in Stewie's head. One cuts through: ""Do you know what you said at the bank? Because we were trapped in that bank, you said that gun had a way out when life became too heavy. Has your mindset changed, Brian? ""Brian doesn't answer. Stewie looks at him. Realization was dawning on him. Oh god. ""Okay, we have three options. Hospital, 911, or a gun lock."" Brian thinks for a beat. ""I don't want to go to the hospital. Or have you called 911? So‚Ä¶ a gun lock."" Brian replied, ""Of course,"" Stewie replies flatly. Then raises an eyebrow. ""But where would we find a gun lock?"" Brian blinks. ""Are you serious? It's been unlocked for three months. Stewie's already on his phone. ""Free guns are locked near me. Oh, look, Brian. The police have a gun lock. Let's go"". They drive to the Police Station. At the front desk, the officer hands over the lock. Stewie takes it. He give  



 



 



 Brian gave a sharp look. Voice quietly: ""Let's not have an accident."" He stares into Brian's soul. Five full seconds. They drive to the bank. The thick silence clings to his throat and settles in his chest. They're back here again. The gun lock feels like a brick in his hand. Heavy. Cold. Too necessary. The vault opens. Inside: a gun. And a book. Brian steps forward. ""One moment."" He lifts the gun like he's done a thousand times. Hands steady. The movements are too smooth. Flick. Click. Pop. The chamber opens. 



 



 A single bullet drops into his paw. He stares at it. A moment of looking at it. Stewie's face changes into pure fear. Then, with zero hesitation, Brian snaps the chamber shut. There's nothing behind his eyes when he does it. It's just a dog who's done pretending. No emotion. No change in expression. Just a routine. He doesn't speak right away. His expression says everything. Brian, calm as ever: ""I wanted to check if there was a bullet in there."" Stewie's voice is tight, eyes sharp: ""You damn knew there was a bullet in there."" Without another word, Stewie locks the gun. Hands trembling, grip firm. He locks it like it's the only thing keeping his heart from falling apart. Stewie's face made me give a sharp glance at Brian. ""What the fuck, Brian? Why do you look at that bullet like that?"" 10 seconds of silence. Brian goes silent and blank, not looking at Stewie. ""Oh, oh god, we need to go to the hospital now."" The room is quiet except for the click of the gun lock. Stewie is standing in one place. Breathing hard and fast. Then look at Brian with shock and fear.  



   



Stewie speeds to the hospital. Weaves through traffic. He picks up the phone. Calls Meg. In a panicked voice, ""meet me in the hospital. It is Brian. Don't tell Peter or Lois, one won't care, and the other one will make it worse. ""Meg tease. You called me instead of handling it on our own. Must be something huge."" There was a pause."" How big is it?"" she asked."" Meg, "" ...It is huge, so meet me at the hospital. ""



   



They wait in the waiting room. Time slows down. Meg is there, Stewie, and Brian. Before they check in, Brian. Stewie says Thank God it is over. Brian's face fell into a frown. Stewie's face says Say what the fuck you wanted to say. Brian gets taken.   



   



Meg and Stewie come home. Stewie sits down on the couch. And looks around the room. What the fuck did his face mean, he thought. Then his eyes caught the brown box. Sitting under the coffee table, He slowly reaches the box. And in the box was a collar, a book, and a note that crumbled up. He opened the note and said, ""Take care of the stuff. This stuff is worth more than anything in my life."" Stewie's mouth drops, and the note drops. Meg backs away.    



   



Two weeks later, Brian was released from the hospital. The air is tense. Stewie turns on the radio. The song ended with another happy, upbeat tune. The next song was called ""Let Down"" by Radiohead. Stewie tries to change the song but doesn't. ""You know, you know where you are with   



You know where you are with   



Floor collapsing   



Floating, bouncing back. They get to the end of the song, and he turns off the music. Stewie whispers, ""I know where I am. Briain pauses. With my best friend, who has a way out, it's like another task. Dinner is silent, and Lois and Peter joke about their days. But the silence between Meg, Brian, and Stewie is undeniable. It's night. Brian goes to Stewie's room. And look around. He sees a book that has a bump. He picks it up. Click. The key dropped. He looks at Stewie, whispers Not today, and hurriedly puts away the key. The next day, Brian and Stewie eat breakfast. Brian says, ""Did you know that books are the key to an open mind? Brian stares at Stewie. But it was blank with a sad eye pleading for help.    



At 3 pm.. He picks up the phone and calls Joe, the police officer. Ring. ""What's up, Stewie? ""Joe answered. ""I will be at the library in an hour. Please."" Something shifted in Joe's voice. ""Okay, I'll be there."" The library was quiet. Two of them were at one table. ""So,' Joe said, clearing his throat,"" What's up?"". Stewie didn't look; He slid the key across the table, Joe. Joe picked it up. ""What is this, Stewie?"" Joe said. The gun lock, Brian's Stewie voice was flat. ""It's Brian's way out. Just take it."" Joe froze. Stewie's eye flicked up for the first time. He opened his mouth to explain the box, the bullet, and how Brian's hand didn't shake. But the word caught. He shut his mouth. And that was enough. ",1,1756934589.0,u_Civil-Advance-2841,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone, I (28M) have been with my partner (26F) for 11 years, and I‚Äôm confused about whether what I‚Äôm experiencing is emotional abuse or just ‚Äúnormal‚Äù conflict. I felt like living a progressive hierarchy building between us since we started living together, two years ago.

Some of the negative patterns or episodes that profoundly touched me:

* When I try to talk through issues, she often stonewalls me: silence treatment, she tells me she's tired, that's not the moment to speak, or that I'm ""heavy"".
* During arguments, she sometimes says things like *‚Äúyou‚Äôre useless in the house‚Äù* or *‚Äúthen just leave me‚Äù*. Minutes later she‚Äôll act like nothing happened, without apologizing, being kind and lovely, never acknowledging what she did before.
* After a 12-hour shift at work when I was exhausted and asked her to cook dinner, instead of showing empathy she said *‚Äúwell, just make yourself a salad‚Äù* while lying on the couch, scrolling tiktok
* There‚Äôs a constant sense of hypercriticism at home, like I‚Äôm always being corrected, evaluated, or ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù in small ways
* She can be very controlling in little things: for example, insisting I eat older leftovers instead of opening new food, or telling me what I should/shouldn‚Äôt cook even when I‚Äôve already started preparing something
* She makes decisions for both of us (‚Äúwe‚Äôre eating this tonight, I‚Äôve already decided‚Äù) and leaves little space for my input
* She often invites me not to wear in a certain way because it's not ""cool"" or an underwear because not ""sexy"" (she often tries to hide me things she doesn't enjoy)
* Sometimes when I try to open up about something serious, she dismisses it with sarcasm or by making a noise (like burping loudly while I‚Äôm mid-sentence, as if to mock me).
* She often chooses her own portion of food while I intentionally give her the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù one (more seasoned, cooked better). I tend to be sacrificial for her, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it goes both ways.

At the same time, there are positives:

* For my birthday she decorated the house with balloons, bought my favorite coffee and sweets, and even organized thoughtful gifts with my family.
* Sometimes she does small caring gestures, like preparing fruit for me, making sure there‚Äôs cold coffee in the fridge, or asking me to join her at the gym (offering to pay my entry).
* We do share moments of playfulness and affection when things are good.

The problem is that the negatives feel like a constant ‚Äúdrip-drip-drip‚Äù of criticism, dismissiveness, and control, which makes the positive gestures feel more confusing than reassuring. Even if the positive/negative ratio is 90/10-95/5, it's beginning to be difficult to bear.

So I‚Äôm honestly wondering: are these signs of emotional abuse, or just normal relationship ups and downs? How do you know when you‚Äôre in something toxic versus just going through rough patches? I feel disrespected and frustrated, but I fear I'm overreacting or hypersensitive.

* When do people book in for medical cannabis consultations?

* Ready to take the next step?

In last month's blog,¬†[***‚Äò90,000 interactions. One clinic. Medical cannabis matters***](https://releaf.co.uk/blog/medical-cannabis-engagement-releaf-insights)***‚Äô***¬†we revealed there were 4,600 visits to our pricing page and almost 20,000 visits to our sign-up page in the final week of June alone. These statistics, naturally, sparked our curiosity.

We wanted to know more. Not just about this week or this group of potential¬†[medical cannabis patients,](https://releaf.co.uk/patient-stories)¬†but about every week since our clinic launched and every patient we support, to see how this translates into clinical behaviours.¬†

So, we performed another data analysis.¬†¬†

In this analysis, we get into the nitty-gritty. The times, days, and even dates, Releaf accounts are created, consultations with our expert doctors and nurses are booked in, and prescribed medications are ordered, are explored here to identify behavioural patterns.¬†

Why?¬†

So that we can get to know our patients even more.

So, without further ado, let‚Äôs get started:

# When do people sign up for medical cannabis?

Our recent analysis found:¬†

* Mondays and Wednesdays are the most popular days for people to create an account with Releaf with 15.4% and 15% of all accounts created on these days.
* This is followed by Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday (14.8%, 14.6% and 14.7% respectively), Friday (13.5%) and Saturday (12.5%).

And, that didn‚Äôt seem enough - so we got even more granular:¬†

* Releaf accounts are created most frequently during the day, peaking between 12pm and 3pm (17.7%)
* The next most popular time was between 9am and 11am in the morning (16.4%).¬†
* Only 6% of Releaf accounts have been created between 12am and 5am.¬†

From these figures, it wouldn‚Äôt be unreasonable to assume that most have either signed up to¬†[Releaf¬†](http://releaf.co.uk/)during their lunch break, or, at the start of their working day.¬†***But why?***¬†

Perhaps because their symptoms have made the morning tough, or perhaps thei[r motivation had peaked,](https://releaf.co.uk/blog/motivated-mondays-why-the-start-of-the-week-is-popular-for-healthcare)¬†or perhaps because they‚Äôd ‚Äòslept on it‚Äô and decided to sign up after their first coffee. Regardless of the motivation, the figures remain the same.¬†

So, off the back of this, we‚Äôve implemented steps to make the process as quick as possible, so that you can get back to your lunch - or start your day - with all your ducks in a row.¬†

How? Well, earlier this year, we integrated with¬†[NHS Login](https://releaf.co.uk/blog/making-history-in-healthcare-releaf-integrate-with-nhs-spine)¬†to allow patients to grant us instantaneous and automatic access to their medical records, speeding up the signup and triage process considerably.¬†

Why? Because our core belief has always been the same: healthcare should be easy to access, and patient-led. And with account creation being the first step in every patient‚Äôs Releaf journey, we‚Äôre continually improving the sign-up and account creation process to make it as simple and streamlined as possible.

# What conditions are people turning to medical cannabis for?

So now that we‚Äôve established when these accounts were created, let‚Äôs take a look at why.¬†

Our data shows that chronic pain dominates as the primary reason for signing up to medical cannabis through Releaf, affecting almost 2 out of 3 of those who create an account.¬†

Over half also cited mental health concerns such as¬†[anxiety](https://releaf.co.uk/conditions/psychiatric/anxiety-medical-cannabis-treatment-uk)¬†and¬†[depression,](https://releaf.co.uk/conditions/psychiatric/depression-medical-cannabis-treatment-uk)¬†and a combined 38% cited sleep-related issues.¬†

These clinical findings align with the trends we found when we conducted our analysis into online behaviours, and interactions with our website. Here we found our dedicated¬†[medical cannabis and mental health,](https://releaf.co.uk/conditions/psychiatric)¬†and¬†[medical cannabis and chronic pain,](https://releaf.co.uk/conditions/pain)¬†webpages were viewed over 3,000 times in the space of 90 days, and our[¬†medical cannabis and sleeping disorder¬†](https://releaf.co.uk/conditions/sleep-disorders])page was viewed 1,500 times in this same space of time.

And while these are the most frequently presented conditions at Releaf, the patients we treat have almost 60 different diagnosis‚Äô altogether.¬†

# When do people book in for medical cannabis consultations?

Now we‚Äôve looked into when and why people make their first steps in terms of creating an account, let's have a look at when they‚Äôre keen to take the next step, and meet with a¬†[medical cannabis doctor.¬†](https://releaf.co.uk/medical-cannabis-doctors-uk)

This dataset found 43% of Releaf patients book in for and pay for their[¬†initial consultation](https://releaf.co.uk/blog/your-first-medical-cannabis-consultation)¬†on the day they create their account, suggesting a large proportion feel confident and ready to take the next step simply after signing up.

And when it comes to the days these consults are booked in for, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays repeatedly prove the most popular.

Because of this, we‚Äôve upped our clinical availability during the week by onboarding even more doctors and nurses to prescribe medical cannabis through¬†[Releaf¬†](http://releaf.co.uk/)\- and, will continue to do so as our patient base grows.¬†

# When do people order medical cannabis?

Now we‚Äôve covered the account creation and appointment booking data, we thought it would be good to take a look at all things pertaining to prescriptions.

Here‚Äôs what we found:¬†

* Most prescription orders are placed in the morning, with 20% at 9am, 11% at 10am, 10% at 8am and 8% at 11am.¬†
* Meanwhile, only 1.7% are placed between 12am and 6am.¬†
* Releaf patients typically order their medication on a weekday, with 89.6% of orders being placed between Monday and Friday.¬†

So, much like account creation and consultation booking, it appears most medical cannabis patients in the UK like to get their health admin out of the way at the start of the week. But, this time we took it another step further, and looked into specific dates.¬†

Unsurprisingly because of salaried paydays in the UK, the 30th is the most popular day people[¬†order medical cannabis through Releaf.](https://releaf.co.uk/our-products)¬†Meanwhile, the least popular date for payment of prescriptions is the 31st, which again is unsurprising, as not every month has 31 days.¬†

In general terms, there tends to be a dip in prescription activity towards the middle-late end of the month, with peaks occurring at the start and end of each month. So, what have we done since learning this?

We have enabled part-dispensing on the¬†[Releaf Dashboard](https://releaf.co.uk/blog/navigating-releafs-new-patient-portal)¬†\- meaning patients can order their medical cannabis in 10 gram intervals, cannabis oil in 30mls at a time, and THC vapes in 0.5ml quantities.¬†

This means Releaf patients don‚Äôt need to buy their full monthly prescribed allowance all at once, they can check out as many times as they like within the month providing it's within their prescribed allowance, to make it easier for those who are paid weekly or bi-weekly as opposed to monthly.¬†

# Ready to take the next step?

Our analysis shows that choosing medical cannabis is often a thoughtful, timely decision- whether it‚Äôs signing up during a lunch break, booking a consultation at the start of the week, or placing an order around payday. At¬†[Releaf,¬†](http://releaf.co.uk/)we‚Äôre continually refining our processes to make each step as smooth and patient-friendly as possible.

The surname Hououji (È≥≥Âá∞ÂØ∫) is made up of three kanji, and their meaning is crucial to understanding your analysis of Akane's family. Here are the links and a breakdown of their meaning, which reinforces your theory that they are a powerful dynasty.

È≥≥ (HOU): This kanji means ""male phoenix.""

Âá∞ (OU): This kanji means ""female phoenix.""

ÂØ∫ (JI): This kanji means ""temple.""

Together, È≥≥Âá∞ÂØ∫ translates as ""Temple of the Phoenix."" This name is symbolic and not a coincidence. The phoenix is ‚Äã‚Äãa mythical creature that represents rebirth, power, and immortality. Using this name for a family suggests that they see themselves as a dynasty that has reemerged to dominate politics and the tourism industry.

You can check the meaning of the kanji at these links:
https://www.kanshudo.com/kanji/%E9%B3%B3(HOU)
https://www.kanshudo.com/kanji/%E5%87%B0(0U)
https://www.kanshudo.com/kanji/%E5%AF%BA(JI)

And I think that's why they benefited from this with the resort hotels and Fuwa-san was just a tool for Hayato to blame him for everything.

Akane's family aren't just hoteliers, they represent a dynasty. There are several clues that support your theory, even though the family wears traditional clothing. The way they dress, their clan name, and their actions are the key clues.

Attire: The Elite Uniform
At first glance, Akane's family's attire appears traditional, but if you look closely, it's more than that. Their clothing is formal and elegant, reflecting a taste for luxury and formality. In Japan, the clothing worn by a businessman or politician is a statement of their status. A kimono is a traditional garment, but the one Akane's grandmother wears is made of expensive fabric and has an elegant cut that reflects her elite status. This suggests that their aesthetic is that of a luxury hotel brand, where image is as important as service. It's the uniform of a real estate family, not a family business.

The Name: The Key to Their Business
Akane's family name, Hououji (È≥≥Âá∞ÂØ∫), is the strongest evidence that they are a hotel and real estate company. It's not a random name; it's a symbol of power and ambition.

The Phoenix (È≥≥Âá∞): The phoenix is ‚Äã‚Äãa mythical creature that represents rebirth, power, and immortality. This, in the context of real estate, could mean that their business involves transforming land and properties, taking something old and turning it into something new and luxurious.

The Actions: The Acquisition Strategy
The actions of Akane's family only make sense if viewed as those of a corporation seeking expansion. Their obsession with the coffee plantation is the most compelling evidence. A real estate developer doesn't obsess over a coffee shop, but rather over the land where his grand tourism project is located. His plan to demolish the cafe isn't an act of revenge, but rather a property acquisition.

Fuwa-san's actions confirm his decision when he warns them not to mess with the government, as he had already achieved his goal of making Hayato lose the cafe. He's no longer in the game, but there were still attacks after his visit, which is odd given that he has no reason to attack the mayor.

Now I will explain their power since they have resources as a company and politics

The Political and Economic Power of the Hououji
Akane's mother is a minister, giving them direct access to power. Akane's family uses this power to control the local government and eliminate anyone who stands in their way. In this case, the mayor who opposed their tourism project. Akane's family doesn't act with direct bribes, but instead uses the threat of public shame and ""disgrace"" to manipulate the mayor and force his resignation.

The Hotel as a Symbol of Power
Akane's family's hotel and tourism project is not just a business, but a symbol of their power. For the family, the hotel is a way to demonstrate that their power goes beyond politics and money. Their clan name, Hououji (È≥≥Âá∞ÂØ∫), ""Temple of the Phoenix,"" is a declaration of their ambition to dominate. The phoenix is ‚Äã‚Äãa symbol of rebirth, power, and immortality, reflecting their desire to transform a small town into a tourist destination and, in the process, increase their political and economic power.

The mayor's attacks were strategic since he was against tourist hoteliers

The Motive for the Attack
The main motive for the attack on the mayor was a business plot. Akane's family didn't simply want the caf√©; their real target was the land on which it stood. The city government had planned to build a resort in the area, and the caf√©, owned by an acquaintance of the mayor, was in the way. Akane's family needed to eliminate the mayor in order to continue with their construction project.

The Method of Attack
Rather than resorting to violence or outright bribery, Akane's family used a more subtle and destructive tactic. They accused the mayor of harassment and of accepting a four million yen bribe to oppose the resort project. The attack was carried out through a ""justice accusations"" account on social media, which generated public outrage and severely damaged the mayor's reputation. This type of attack, which destroys a politician's reputation with public accusations, is a common tactic in the worlds of business and politics.

And for that reason they silenced the mayor and also put the honor of Ami's family at stake and also in danger.

Now, the reasons why they silenced him with accusations. Furthermore, Akane's mother was a council member and didn't object. Apparently, the mayor saw something suspicious in this, which reinforced Fuwa-san's warning not to interfere with the government. He noticed, and although the mayor protested, Fuwa-san remained silent.

The Mayor's Silence: A Lonely Opposition
Not only did the mayor not support the project, he actively opposed a ""proposed bill"" from the city council. He apparently did so because he believed the project's profitability was unclear. This meant that the mayor was the only significant obstacle, and therefore, he became the primary target of Akane's family.

The Connection to Akane's Mother
Akane's mother, as a minister, has the political influence necessary to pull the strings at city hall. Her position allows her to manipulate the council and eliminate anyone who opposes her plans. The social media smear campaign that resulted in the mayor's downfall is a tactic only a person with considerable power could have orchestrated. By eliminating the mayor, Akane's family ensured there would be no opposition to their real estate project.

The attacks against the mayor were coordinated and happened so quickly that he had no time to react, demonstrating the effectiveness and power of Akane's family. Mayor Takumi Fujioka learned of the accusations at a press conference and was forced to respond immediately, suggesting he was unprepared for the attack.

Synchronized and Ruthless Attack
The conspiracy was meticulously planned to leave the mayor with no options.

Social Media Attack: The smear campaign through an anonymous social media account was the first step. People, upon reading the accusations of bribery and harassment, were immediately outraged, creating massive public pressure.

Press Conference: The press conference appears to have been timed to coincide with the release of the accusations. The mayor had to respond to the claims immediately, but with no proof of his innocence, he could only state that the claims were baseless and would be investigated by an independent committee. This suggests that the attack took him by surprise and that he was unprepared to defend himself.

Akane's family managed to eliminate their opponent quickly and without leaving any direct evidence of their involvement.

The Coincident Attack: Calculated Collateral Damage
The social media campaign attacked the mayor for ""bribery"" and, at the same time, attacked the caf√©'s reputation, claiming the owner had paid 4 million yen to oppose the resort bill. This coordinated attack had a dual purpose:

To silence the mayor: By accusing him of bribery, Akane's family discredited his opposition to the project, forcing him to resign.

To damage the caf√©: By implying that the caf√© was part of the bribe, Akane's family attacked the business's reputation, making it easier for them to acquire the land.

The speed of the attack and the way it spread on social media demonstrates that Akane's family is not driven by emotions, but by business logic. They are an unscrupulous company that will stop at nothing to get what they want.

And now we return to Fuwa-san, who tells Hayato to make the most of this. It seems like a way of letting him know that the buyer is an expert in this.

Fuwa-san: The Hire Salesman
Fuwa-san isn't just a rival, but a pawn in Akane's family's game. Upon learning who the buyer is, Fuwa-san tells Hayato to ask for more money because he knows Akane's family has the power and the money to pay. If the buyer is a private individual, they'll only pay the market price, but a large real estate corporation with a multi-million-dollar project won't spare any expense.

Fuwa-san's Role
Fuwa-san isn't the buyer of the coffee, but rather a middleman. He's working for Akane's family, who remains in the shadows. His warning to Hayato to ask for more than he is due because ""the other party already knows who the owner is"" is a way of telling him that the buyer is so powerful that he can force him to sell the coffee. His advice is also a sign that he's aware that the property's price is very high due to Akane's family's plot.

Akane's Family as the Final Buyer
Akane's family has a significant advantage over Fuwa-san and the other suitors. Her mother is a minister, which gives them direct access to power and the government. With their power, they can influence the real estate market and manipulate prices in their favor. It's very likely that Akane's family is buying the coffee land for their tourism project, and that Fuwa-san is merely a pawn in their game.

I think that's all. I don't know if there's more, but I think I'll post a second part another day. I tried to be as serious as possible about this topic, and I also know I'm going to get attacked and all that, but the situation calls for it.

So I decided I want to work at my favorite coffee shop:¬†~~(redacted)~~. I want to work there because I'm looking to open up my own coffee shop/vinyl record caf√© in the future and they do really good coffee there, so getting the experience of working at a place like that would be mad beneficial. So I spent a bunch of time getting my resume going and it looks¬†*really*¬†good. I even put it in a plastic protective sleeve and paperclipped three 2x2 inch printed pictures of latte art that I've made. I was very proud and very excited to go in. I knew there was the possibility that it wouldn't work out. And I had to tell myself this. I had to remind myself that god has a plan and if this doesn't work out that's because he has something else in mind for me and hopefully that knowledge can put my nerves at ease.

So I went in, walked up past the line of 26 people, and went to the endo of the counter. I told the employee (Mo, I knew her already) That I'd like to apply for a job and I'm wondering if there's a manager present that I could speak to. And god it's always such an awkward thing but I had to do my best to be confident. I mostly succeeded. Then, she told me ""Oh, we're actually not hiring right now. But I can take your resume! The owner always looks through the resumes even when we're not hiring. And that way, when we are hiring he'll already have your resume!"" I said thank you and told her I was going to get in line to order a coffee. I got in line and tried to not look awkward and I'm pretty sure I succeeded... then I got to the front.

It was ironic because the lady in front of me was talking to the baristas telling them how her brother really wants to work there and that he's fed up with his job. And the baristas laughed because they knew exactly who her brother is. They said, ""Oh yeah, your brother? Every time he comes in he reminds us that he really wants to work here üòÇ."" It was kinda funny because like... that's me. I'm real fed up with my job and I really want to work here.

Then once it was my turn I talked to that same barista. Dave, and asked him how it was going... more specifically, I asked him what's the most exciting thing happening in his life right now. I like to ask that question because it prompts a genuine response over ""How's it going"" which prompts an obligatory inauthentic one. He thought for a second and then said, ""Honestly nothing"" in a semi-depressed tone. (He's a little older than me by the way. I'm 23 and I'd estimate he's 28-31). I kinda laughed and said, ""Aww, that sounded so sad.."" And he replied ""Yeah"" I asked what's going on and tilted my head. He said, ""I'm just not where I want to be right now."" ""Like location wise?"" He clarified, ""No, in my career... I want to be moving on from this place and get focused on what I actually want to do"" I asked him what he was trying to do and he told me he wants to be a firefighter. I have a close friend that's an EMT and is struggling to be a firefighter so I know a little bit about that. I asked him if he has his certs and is doing his testing and just overall talked about the whole process for a few moments until I had to move on from his part of the counter and pay. I paid and left. And when I left I started to feel really down.

So many people, including myself, just aren't where they want to be right now. Me: I'm fed up with my job and want to be progressing. My girlfriend: She was really lost and decided to try out a coaching job at a school and found out she does not like working with kids. She's trying to get a remote job and she's doing her best but she's not there yet. My sister: She's a massage therapist in San Diego but wants to be a singer. Dave from the coffee shop: He's a barista but wants to be further along on his path to firefighting than he currently is. My friend Grant: still struggling as an EMT looking to promote to firefighting. My friend Amber: She finally got her job as a high school chem teacher but she can't even afford to buy a house to move out of her parents house yet which is a high priority because it is an incredibly toxic environment. She could rent but that would be half her paycheck and it just sucks.

Everybody is struggling. It feels like the macroeconomic forces just aren't in peoples favor right now. And it makes me sad.",0,1756933587.0,jobs,0,0.5,False
1n7qxwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n7qxwu/revenge_is_a_dish_best_served_cock/,Revenge is a dish best served COCK!,"For Spring Break 2013 I road-tripped from Chicago to Denver to spend a few days hiking, biking, and hanging out at my friend Pete's place, with some of his CO friends.  Names are real, because Fuck You, Pete.  (note: we've been friends since 7th grade, this is our love language)

Took forever to wrap up loose ends before leaving Chicago, and I didn't hit the road until about 4:00am.  Got out of Chicagoland before traffic, and took a few power-naps along the way.

Super easy drive.  Boring AF drive, but easy.  Sunny, 50F or so.  Had the windows down during said power naps.  Was able to tune into March Madness through most of Nebraska.

Calming, Zen Drive.

And then things went to shit - clouds, then rain, then clumps of slush, then shitty snow, then holy f'in slip-n-slide Interstate 76.

The final 80 miles took almost three hours, much of it after sunset.

Arrived in Denver absolutely frazzled.  Friends wanted me to go out drinking with them, but I was done.  Joined in for a pre-game beer, and wished them well on their way out.

Sleep.  Euphoric sleep.

Until what seemed like 5 minutes later.  It was, in fact, about 5 hours later, a bit after 3:00am.

I regained consciousness to chants of, ""Taco Bell!‚Ä¶  Taco Bell!‚Ä¶""

Fuuuuuuuuuck.

The only way I could make it stop was to designated-drive them to Taco Bell.  A 24-Hour Taco Bell. WTF? I didn't even know that was a thing.

On the drive back, as the drunken assholes finally became silent (they were face-stuffing Taco Bell), I switched off the music and said, ""You know you guys are going to pay for this, right?""

""Don't care.  Taco Bell,"" was the only (somewhat muffled) (mouth full of tacomeat) reply.

Back to sleep by 4:00.  

Woke up AWAKE at about 8:00.  Made breakfast.  Debated fucking with the soon-to-be-hungover detritus splayed about the living room.

And there it was, right there on the coffee table:  Pete's phone.  

SETTINGS / AUTOCORRECT / 

Taco Bell -> COCK!

taco bell -> COCK!

tacobell -> COCK!

Enjoyed the rest of the trip.  Heard nothing about the autocorrect.

Drove back to Chicago:  Nothing.

Spring quarter:  Nothing

Summer: Nothing.

At this point I figured that either it didn't work, he blamed someone else, or he didn't want to give me the satisfaction.

2014:	Nothing

2015:	Nothing

2016 - March 2020:		Nothing

COVID lockdown:  Get a text:  ""You motherfucker.""  

And then a screenshot of a group text message chain with Pete saying,

""I'm just happy that COCK! is an essential service.""

1n7qxs5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n7qxs5,The dark side of cord-cutting [OC],"On June 4, I posted a caption in which I paid homage to my 2012 Scion xD for having reached 160,000 miles. Little did I know, that would be exactly FIFTEEN days before I would NEVER be able to drive my car again. üíÄ

On June 19, 2025, I drove to a coffee shop to get some work done. About an hour and a half into my grind, I got a call from a scary unknown number (which I ignored). The number, however, turned out to be MUCH less scary than the ensuing VOICEMAIL‚Äì‚Äìwhich was a message from the sheriff‚Äôs office informing me that my parked car on the street had been struck by a GARBAGE TRUCK.

Before I go any further, I want to recognize and appreciate that neither I (nor anyone else) was hurt in this incident‚Äì‚Äìand that the situation could‚Äôve been a LOT worse. From what I could tell, a garbage truck had turned a corner TOO sharply and struck my rear left wheel and bumper in the process. It was basically the vehicular equivalent of stubbing your toe‚Äì‚Äìexcept with thousands of dollars‚Äô worth of damage involved. üòé

That dollar figure is NO joke, either. I initially deluded myself into believing that my Scion could be repaired with a couple new parts, some duct tape, spit, and a blessing from a local priest. As the auto shop later pointed out, however, the frame of my car was SO badly rusted that I had no choice but to put my car to sleep and send it off to car heaven. The insurance folks concurred, and I was cut a small check equal to my Scion‚Äôs salvage value.

I have since bought myself a 2024 Toyota Corolla Hatchback, which I absolutely LOVE‚Äì‚Äìmake no mistake. Nevertheless, I have NOT yet finished grieving the loss of my first and ONLY other car of nearly 10 years‚Ä¶ üòî

Realizing her grandma had more friends and a social life than her). She made interesting points that I feel like I could start implementing into my own community here to help those who may feel alone or may not have a club, organization, or church to be a part of. (Plus September is National Suicide Prevention Month, and I know feeling alone is often a power over so many, please use this as something to look forward to!)

#1 I recognized was a consistent meeting spot, every week. (Her grandma was going to church every sunday)
#2 Having multiple different groups to split off into. (Grandma example: Bridge group, brunch group, coffee group, having her friend with dementia over for dinner - all groups stemming from church). 

I'm positive there are more, but IMO those are the most pertinent. I'm suggesting a, ""Group of Groups"" meet-up every single Wednesday at 7pm-7:30pm. (I chose this time because there's typically no large events happening, street parking is free, and usually people need a mid-week de-stresser, and this gives you the opportunity to make plans with someone or somepeople to do something with, giving you something to look forward to!) There is NO sermon, speaker, agenda, rules(other than being courteous of your fellow humans). Just show up and start making friends. I will show up each Wednesday of September with a piece of paper in a 3 ring binder saying, ""Group of Groups"". I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE you to bring something you enjoy and maybe someone will have similar interests ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (personally I will be bringing a cribbage board and cards, and will absolutely teach anyone wanting to learn). 

After September is over I will hopefully still be attending, but will have pushed the weight of 3 RING BINDER POWER over to the community, as I am no leader but merely one of you. Anyone and everyone is encouraged to make their own sign so that at least 1 person showing up will have a sign out showing where we are meeting!

DATE: Every Wednesday (rain, shine, snow)
TIME: 7pm-7:30pm
LOCATION: Memorial Union - Der Rathskellar (where they air badger games).

I also met another woman that night and I've been talking to her too, we even went out for coffee today. I'm also going out for coffee with my ex tomorrow and I'm feeling conflicted.

I think that the new girl is pretty into me and I'm contemplating just making it clear from the start that exclusivity is probably not going to happen. That being said, if things don't work out with my ex, I'd be ready to give the new girl a shot, I really like her too.

I'm also not even sure if I want to be exclusive with either of them. 

Also, I'm not really sure either of them is contemplating exclusivity with me. So if I bring it up, maybe it's too soon. If I wait, maybe it's too late... 

What should I do? I want to be as honest as possible, but at the same time is it really their business who else I'm talking to if exclusivity isn't a conversation yet? At the same time, I kind of don't want to say anything to risk things with either of them, which is a disingenuous thought on my part.

I also brought several lightweight packable towels, and I needed them!¬† One I cut in half to have a washcloth for showering, two we used as full-sized towels for showering, but then we wanted them to dry our feet after the river crossings too! [https://www.litesmith.com/lightload-towels/](https://www.litesmith.com/lightload-towels/)

Small stick of bodyglide

**Food**: 4 vegan backpacking dinners (Pad Thai and Chili Mac), 10 cliff bars, two vegan backpacking breakfasts (a berry granola hot cereal, which was very good), Starbucks instant coffee packets, lactaid, plus a bag to fit all of this and the food we bought in Iceland (wound up doing two bags to split between our backpacks)

**Cooking**: 2 plastic produce bags for garbage, 2 lighters (plus one in our emergency kit), backpacking stove, pot, and forks (bought fuel there)

**Clothes** (per person): Waterproof hiking boots (allegedly, mine failed), 5 pairs of socks, 5 pairs of underwear, water shoes (Classic slip on water shoes from Lands End), Thermal base layers top and bottom, lightweight long sleeved t shirt, warm hats, two pairs of gloves, one pair of hiking pants (Prana Stretch Zion), rain jacket (REI), rain pants (REI), puffy coat, two sports bras, sunglasses, swim suit

I highly recommend bringing bags (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8VT82FT?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title) for your clean clothes and a different bag or method of storage for your dirty clothes.¬† They get wet and covered in sand.

**Sleeping arrangements**: Tent (REI Halfdome 2 I think), sleeping bags rated to 20F, sleeping bag liner, mattress pads, backpacking pillows, repair kit for tent and mattress pads, waterproof stuff sacks for sleeping bags

**Other**: Backpacks with waterproof covers, first aid kit, trekking poles, camelbacks, one Nalgene bottle, toilet paper, knife, multitool, powerblock and short charging cable for phones, bug nets, cables to hang things to dry in tent, kindles, some cash, multiple credit cards, passports, phones

**Things we are definitely glad we brought** (beyond the obvious): the multitool had pliers good for pulling up tent stakes, the cable to hang stuff in our tent was very welcome to keep our wet clothes off our sleeping bags, some way to hang your rain gear outside of your tent but under the rain fly if possible, trekking poles were critical for sketchy, slippery dirt and the water crossings (and I don‚Äôt usually use them), and the towels and lightweight bags were very nice to have.

**Things we wished we brought, or wished we didn‚Äôt**: we brought the swimsuits for the sauna at the Volcano Huts, but didn‚Äôt wind up using it; the water shoes were fine for me, but my husband wished he had his chackos instead, we did not need our puffy coats (though I might bring them anyway), and, most importantly, I wish I had brought several additional pairs of socks.¬† Our packs were plenty light enough.

**A note on credit cards:**

My credit card (Wells Fargo Autograph Card) kept repeatedly denying online transactions, and I could not push them through without calling the company.¬† Because of this, the date for one of the bus trips must have reset when I was trying to book it and I did not notice.¬† I booked it for the wrong day, but fortunately they were able to accommodate us.¬† Fortunately my card was not declined once I was in Iceland.

Also, triple check your bank statement when you get home.¬† My husband was double charged at a bakery and I was charged two different full-room amounts at a hotel where we stayed one night.

Day 1 thoughts ‚Äì We wound up using the public bus system to get to some better stores; google maps just told us the route to go, and it was very easy.¬† The Bonus in Reykjavik was quite small and I wasn‚Äôt sure where to go for camp fuel ‚Äì BSI would have had it, but the store was closed when we arrived, and it would have been very expensive.¬† There was not a place where people were leaving unfinished cans of gas anywhere that we were at the start of our trip.¬† We only saw it in Thorsmork, at the end of the way people usually do the trail.

We thought the Hygge bakery was fine and Harry‚Äôs Seafood and Grill was quite good.

**Day 2: Travel to Landmannalauger and hike to Hraftinnusker (bit crowded, but beautiful day)**

Get up early

Breakfast: instant coffee from hotel and our yogurt we picked up yesterday

Walk to BSI bus terminal to catch 7 AM bus to Landmannalauger

Bus stopped in Hella on the way ‚Äì just go to the gas station to use the bathroom, the line in the bakery was ridiculously long; got coffee at the gas station

Get a very expensive but very delicious hot dog at the green bus shop in Landmannalauger for lunch

Hike to Hrafntinnusker at about noon, after the hot dog.

Day 2 thoughts ‚Äì Somehow I screwed up the day on our bus ticket.¬† Thankfully the bus was not full and he was able to load my ticket from the different day.¬† This was the biggest stress and mistake of our trip.¬† Getting coffee at the gas station was a mistake, since I had to pee for the next 2 hours over the rugged roads to Landmannalauger.¬† The hike on the first day was frustrating until we lost the day-hikers; I felt they were very in the way, and we constantly had people all over us for the first several miles.

The hike itself was beautiful, but very windy.¬† It took us about 3.5 hours, and we‚Äôre not particularly fast hikers.¬† It took a bit of trial and error to figure out how to attach our rain fly for our backpacks so that they would be impervious to the wind.¬† It was not raining very hard, only misting.¬† Our biggest mistake was that we were warm, and it really wasn‚Äôt raining very hard, so we did not put on our rain pants.¬† Of course we forgot about the fact that drying our pants would be a problem!

Hraftinnusker was my favorite of the rugged camp sites we used.¬† It had the nicest hut for cooking and they had nice circles of rocks to protect the tents from the wind.¬† It did not occur to me in advance that the hut would be absolutely necessary for cooking ‚Äì the wind and the rain would otherwise make it very miserable!¬† The toilets did smell horrible ‚Äì I think that if people closed the lids, it would smell much better, but there were no signs telling people to close the lids.¬† There was a single outhouse closer to the tents that smelled much better.¬† All bathrooms had toilet paper except this one, but I brought some TP so I used it most of the time.¬† The warden came out at 7 PM to give us an update on the weather for the next day.¬† He advised us to delay our departure until the afternoon to avoid the bad weather and maybe get a little sunshine the next day.

At night, there was a lot of wind ‚Äì we started to wonder if our tent was sturdy enough!¬† We brought an ultralight tent (REI halfdome 2).¬† It held up, but it seemed to get whipped around more than other tents.

Also at night, there was some sort of snow/sleet/rain precipitation that seriously hindered visibility.¬† The reflectors on my tent were hidden by the rock circle, and every obsidian rock reflected my head lamp.¬† I got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and could not find the way back to the tent.¬† Fortunately they left the lights on at the hut, so I didn‚Äôt worry about actually getting lost, but if they had it would have been a very concerning time.¬† I kept going back to the cooking hut to get my bearings and then heading out again.¬† Maybe leave a light on in your tent?¬† Or at least dress to be out for more than a few minutes, just in case.

**Day 3: Hike to Alftavatn (perfect day, amazing views, ideal weather)**

The weather cleared earlier than anticipated, so we headed out a little before noon.¬† This day was so perfect.¬† Just amazing views, perfect weather, and an all around very enjoyable hike.¬† We did the first river crossing, which was no big deal.¬† We got to see the sun.¬† I wore my baselayer and my rain pants only, which was perfect.

We got to Alftavatn at around 5:30, which was later than expected.¬† It was such a nice hike that we stopped for longer to enjoy it.¬† The warden had advised us to continue on to Hvanngil, but you try explaining to your hungry husband why he can‚Äôt relax and eat at the restaurant as promised!¬† There was no way he was hiking another 4 km, and it did not feel very windy at Alftavatn.

Alas, it was, in fact, quite windy, which became clear after we set up the tent.¬† We once again worried it would collapse, but we were very tired and managed to sleep through it anyway.¬† This campsite had nice bathrooms and a shower, which we took advantage of.¬† It was very nice to have a hot shower.

The restaurant was fine.¬† Somehow a lot of people had made reservations there?¬† I don‚Äôt even know how you would do that, or how you would know to do so.¬† Fortunately they had one table that was not reserved where we could eat.¬† They only had one thing available for dinner (quinoa chili).

**Day 4: Hike to Emstrur (trudge in the wind and rain)**

We elected to pack up our tent and hike to Hvanngil to cook.¬† There was no cooking hut at Alftavatn, and the wind and rain would have made our breakfast unpleasant.

There was a river crossing between the two huts.¬† It wasn‚Äôt too bad, but the weather was colder, windier, and rainier today.¬† As my husband said: ‚ÄúThe only part of my that was dry was my feet.¬† I‚Äôd really like to change that!‚Äù¬† So, we did the crossing, but grumbled a little bit about the cold water and wet feet.

Hvanngil really was kind of far, and I‚Äôm glad we didn‚Äôt hike there after our late start the previous day.¬† The hut was strange ‚Äì I was under the impression that you should pay a day fee to use the facilities, but the warden looked at us like we were insane.¬† She pointed us in the direction of the cooking hut, which was not near the rest of the huts ‚Äì we actually thought it was a barn for animals or something.¬† There was a downstairs area that was very dark and an upstairs area for cooking.¬† It was not as nice as the hut at Hraftinnusker, but it was welcome given the weather.

After Hvanngil, we had to cross another river (same story, cold, wet, rainy) and then started on what felt like 15 miles of straight black sand (but in reality was probably 7 miles).¬† It was so windy that the flaps covering the zippers on our rain pants were completely blown open and the rain penetrated the zipper, getting our legs all wet.¬† My waterproof boots failed this day also, although it took me a while to realize it (I was blaming the pants). ¬†My raincoat from REI wet through too, so I was generally quite damp! ¬†Visibility was poor, so we just felt like we were on a desolate black expanse forever.¬† I was very happy to finally reach Emstrur.

Emstrur was supposed to be more sheltered, and perhaps it was, but the weather was worse and we once again felt like our tent was collapsing.¬† My husband was starting to lose his patience with being very wet, which made selecting a campsite and setting up the tent difficult.¬† We did not want to leave the tent after entering it, so we ate a cold dinner rather than venturing back out into the rain.¬† I did have to go out twice to use the bathroom.¬† Our tent was far away from the hut, so I was very careful to memorize the route so as not to get lost.¬† Visibility was pretty good, but they did not leave the lights on at the hut.¬† My husband turned his headlamp on in the tent to make it easier to find my way back.

**Day 5: Hike to Thorsmork (improving weather, tough water crossing, whole feet became hot spots)**

The wind was wicked in the morning, but once I got up to find the bathroom I found it wasn‚Äôt as bad up by the hut.¬† I used this information to coax the grumpy husband out of his warm sleeping bag.¬† My feet started out a little raw from my failed boots yesterday, and the situation only got worse as the day went on.

We ate our pad thai dinners that were supposed to be for last night for breakfast this morning.¬† We spoke to the warden about the last river crossing, which I heard could be challenging.¬† He said it was deep, and you‚Äôd probably have to take your pants off, but that it should be fine.

As a side note, we saw later on facebook that they issued a warning to hikers to remain at the huts due to the high water levels.¬† I guess that warning was issued after we spoke to the warden, and we had no other way of knowing, so we ventured on.

We expected the weather to be horrible today, but it slowly improved as we hiked.¬† The landscape was much more varied, and we got intermittent protection from the wind.¬† We saw a beautiful rainbow.

The biggest problem was my failed boots.¬† I still hadn‚Äôt pegged them as the problem for why my feet were getting wet.¬† I stopped to wring out my socks and put on some blister cream, but they were still pretty uncomfortable and slowed me down.¬†

The final river crossing was much more challenging than expected.¬† The water came up to my mid-thigh at the deepest point and was moving very fast.¬† I was very glad for my trekking poles.¬† I never actually thought I was going to get swept away, but I definitely had moments where I really needed my next step to get me into a better situation or else I would be worried I‚Äôd be swept away.¬† I don‚Äôt think losing your feet would be fatal; I think you‚Äôd wind up in a pile of rocks downstream.¬† But I wasn‚Äôt sure of that and did not want to find out!

After getting our boots back on, I stepped into the water of a final shallow part of the stream that we hadn‚Äôt crossed.¬† This is the point where I realized my boots were definitely compromised and now full of water.¬† Unfortunately the last 2 miles were pretty rough for me.¬† I stopped and wrang out my sock again halfway, which mildly improved things.¬† They were quite sore for the rest of the night after reaching our campsite, and still pretty sore the next day, but they improved a lot after that.

Speaking of campsites, we did the glamping hut at the Volcano Huts in Thorsmork this night and I could not be happier.¬† That tent was the best thing I ever saw.¬† It had a heater, so we could dry some of our wet things, and a real bed with real blankets, and a hot shower with no time limit.¬† That shower was the best of my life.¬† Just so warm, and so big, and you had as much time as you wanted so I could really try to wash all of the black sand off my feet and water shoes (although there was still more ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think it will ever all go away).¬† We ate the dinner buffet at the restaurant.¬† You didn‚Äôt have to book in advance, but I would if you‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre going to eat there ‚Äì it‚Äôs not a big operation, so it helps them to know how much food to make.¬† The restaurant was very nice and a good place to hang out, but we were so tired and not in the mood for socializing. ¬†Went to bed early.

**Day 6: Hang in Thorsmork, then take bus back to Reykjavik (perfect recovery day, welcome rest)**

Checkout was at 10 AM, so we got up and went to the breakfast buffet and then packed up all our stuff.¬† They had a place to store our bags, so we grabbed a water bottle and did a short hike that left from next to the sauna up to a beautiful overlook.¬† The weather was sunny and warm and we took off our boots up there and sat in the grass.¬† On the way back down we found a cave that was cool to hang out in.

Then we walked along the water to the end of the levy/dam/whatever it was (turning left from the huts) and found a place where we could dip our feet in the river.¬† The cool water and soft sand felt amazing.¬† We had a snack there while our feet dried off before heading back to the huts.¬† They had lots of tables that we could hang out at, but my husband was restless and so we went out to hike around some more.¬† Due to limited time and increasingly sore feet, this was not as rewarding, but it was fine anyway.

The bus came at 4 ([https://www.re.is/highland-bus/](https://www.re.is/highland-bus/)).¬† It was honestly quite early (arrived around 3:30-3:40) and seemed like it would have left without us if we had gotten there right at 4, so definitely good to be early.¬† Watching that bus cross the 5 foot deep river was very impressive.¬† It stopped in Hella (or around there) on the way back and we had to move to a different bus that was much more crowded.¬† We only had 10 minutes to move our bags to the new bus and use the bathroom, which was quite rushed.

The bus dropped us off at BSI bus terminal and we hobbled to our luggage storage at the hostel and then to our very welcome hotel (Center Hotel Laugavegur).¬†",2,1756932926.0,VisitingIceland,0,1.0,False

I threw a stuffed animal off the bed and it bounced off the wall onto her bedside stand, knocking her laptop off. The laptop ended up with a crack down the screen. I agreed I‚Äôd help pay to get it fixed.

Summer went by and she didn‚Äôt mention it again until the beginning of August, when she told me it would cost $400 to repair. I told her I could give her half of that at the time. Yesterday, while I was at her apartment, I left some money and texted her about it. This is how that conversation went: (warning for bad grammar lol) 

Me: I left $90 on your night stand under your candle btw for your laptop, I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs all the money I got rn but I‚Äôll have more one day 
Her: Can you just ask your parents I really need to get it fixed and I don‚Äôt have 300 dollars 
Me: I can‚Äôt ask them they‚Äôve spent a lot of money on my car already and if I ask I‚Äôm just going to get yelled at and told no 
Her: Ik but you are the one the broke it and it shouldn‚Äôt be my responsibility 
Me: I could‚Äôve not given you anything but I choose to give you literally everything I have I‚Äôm not in a good position right now especially with having classes I haven‚Äôt been babysitting so I literally have 0 income right now like I‚Äôm trying my best I already feel like shit 
Her: Well I‚Äôm pissed and your the one that broke my computer tell you parent 
Answer my text tell your parents 
Me: And what are my parents going to do about it? They won‚Äôt even take me to the fucking grocery store and you out of all people should understand the relationship I have with them it‚Äôs extremely disrespectful for you to be asking me that. It was an accident, I‚Äôm taking accountability and paying you back, I never said I‚Äôm not going to, it‚Äôs just gonna be a few weeks, and your acting like your laptop is completely unusable when it‚Äôs not. You could‚Äôve figured it out with me over the summer but you didn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs not on me, I‚Äôm doing what I can and if that‚Äôs not good enough for you, don‚Äôt talk to me. I‚Äôm not going to sit here and let you disrespect me. 
Her: I get that it‚Äôs in close disrespectful, but you‚Äôre also the one that broke it. It was an accident, but you still have to take responsibility for what you did and it‚Äôs been months. That‚Äôs the problem and there‚Äôs things I need to do with the touchscreen, but I can‚Äôt because you broke it. I got that computer because it had a touchscreen And I couldn‚Äôt figure it out because you weren‚Äôt paying me and I‚Äôm not the one disrespecting you you‚Äôre disrespecting me and my stuff in my time this is your responsibility to pay me back for something you did you know I don‚Äôt care about money and letting you use things and letting you stay at my place but this is all your fault. I am not disrespecting you so don‚Äôt even say that.
I‚Äôve also asked so many people to check me if I‚Äôm being disrespectful or doing too much but you know what so many people have told me to text your mother and your dad, but I said no because I didn‚Äôt want that to affect our relationship, but it‚Äôs to the point where you are being blatantly disrespectful and rude to me when I have given you months to give me the money
Me: I already gave you money and told you how I‚Äôm gonna pay you back so it‚Äôs not fair acting like I‚Äôm not taking responsibility. Yeah it was me that caused the accident but it also wouldn‚Äôt of happened if your laptop was somewhere safe and not on your bedside stand. It‚Äôs not just about the relationship I have with my parents either, they don‚Äôt just have extra money laying around. They have bills, the camper, credit cards, stuff you don‚Äôt even realize. I‚Äôm paying you back with what I can, when I can. This doesn‚Äôt involve my parents whatsoever, I‚Äôll tell them, idc about that but like I said, nothing is going to come from it. And like yeah I appreciate the times you‚Äôve been there for me, it means a lot to me and I love you, but you also know I hate asking people for things. I never asked you for food, and staying at your apartment before class wasn‚Äôt something I even had a choice about, if I could‚Äôve avoided that, I would‚Äôve. So it feels like you‚Äôre just using those things against me now. What I‚Äôm not okay with is you guilt tripping me and especially saying you‚Äôd text my parents. That‚Äôs super disrespectful and if you actually did that I don‚Äôt think I could forgive you. And you don‚Äôt get to tell me how I should feel about being disrespected, those are my feelings not yours. I am taking accountability but I‚Äôm not gonna let you cross my boundaries in the process 
Her: And I can set my fucking computer on my nightstand if I fucking want, and I don't wanna rent those slow ass computers from uni when I spent $1000 on a computer and you're the one guilt tripping me saying that your parents don't have the money when they spend random amounts of money on stupid stuff it's the fact that you can't even ask to see if they will say yes I can understand why they would say no if you broke your laptop, but it's the fact that you broke mine and I am doing as much as I can to stay respectful but it's the fact that you won't even try to get the money when you were spending money on coffee and leaving the whole coffee in my room. You have had five months to pay me. You automatically were disrespectful to me from the get-go saying that you could've not given me anything when I've been asking you to pay me for about two months now when I had time to get my computer fixed
Me: I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs your fault because you set it there, but you‚Äôre acting like the only reason it broke was because of me. Yeah I had a part in it, but there were other factors too, it‚Äôs nuanced. The computers they rent out are fine, if they weren‚Äôt, they wouldn‚Äôt give them to students. What my parents spend their money on has nothing to do with me. I don‚Äôt control their spending, and I didn‚Äôt buy coffee. Malorie gave it to me because she didn‚Äôt like it. I haven‚Äôt spent a dime in a month, actually exactly when told me how much it would cost to fix because my priority has been to pay you back. You didn‚Äôt even tell me the cost until the beginning of August. I also don‚Äôt get how you‚Äôve talked about Carly not taking your feelings seriously and brushing them off, yet you‚Äôre literally doing the same to me. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be disrespectful, I was setting a boundary when you told me to ask my parents. Doubling down after I calmly explained why that isn‚Äôt okay is what‚Äôs actually disrespectful. it‚Äôs disregarding what I said and acting like you know better. You might think my parents would pay because I broke it, but that‚Äôs exactly why they wouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not their responsibility, and they‚Äôd tell you the same thing. And yeah, I said I could‚Äôve not given you any money because you barely asked or talked about it. If this was such a big deal, you should‚Äôve communicated that better with me.
I‚Äôm done arguing, so please don‚Äôt text me about this again. I‚Äôll continue paying you back like I said. 

She‚Äôs texted me since then I just haven‚Äôt looked. So tell me Reddit, am I being unreasonable?

I am of two minds for this. I love that this patch has forced me to think outside of the box, and vats, but I do kind of hate that I don't use cremator as much anymore. Why don't I? See below. 

https://imgur.com/a/DCwxxFO

Because the Gauss minigun is now so superpowered that using anything else just seems pointless. Yes you need two separate gauss miniguns for this build I'll explain why. Yes this build is extremely mod heavy. It is not a beginner build. 

In this patch, multiple projectiles is the new name of the game. Each projectile counts in both bullet storm and onslaught stacks. What this means is... You want to be throwing as many bullets downfield as possible. 

For my everyday non-raid build I use reverse onslaught. Yes really. Tri-Barrel Gauss minigun with explosive instead of rapid. I use single projectile weapons because I am doing such high damage to mobs that two shots from the Gauss minigun will destroy literally everything in the game. Fire starters take about three shots. If they are close, you can take a fire starter down with a single shot at max onslaught and bulletstorm. I have found that consistently I put out nearly double the damage using reverse onslaught and single projectile then I do using regular onslaught and just throwing more bullets downrange. It is also much better for your AP. I use vats crit whenever possible. I also tried it a couple different ways and I found class freak to be absolutely necessary or I was pretty much made of paper. Great survivability with this. The new EMT perk is absolutely wild. Auto revive along with the agility stimpack use perk means the only person killing you will be yourself. Yes you will kill yourself a lot with the gauss minigun and this build. If you shoot a wall. You will evaporate. Don't shoot walls. Git gud. Grenadier is in place because it will tag about 10 times more enemies if you just spray and pray at events. I have never had so many corpses for looting at rad rumble. 

I purposefully do not run stabilized in my everyday build because I want my weapons inaccurate so that they tag more things with spread. No one needs a laser beam gat plaz when you're trying to hit everything in sight. 

For raids this is my heartbreak... But also new fun. Penta barrel gauss mini. Faster fire rate. Polished might be better than conductors right now for sure, but I can't be buggered to keep my weapons that repaired. Pinpointers if you like it. I am still using conductors because sometimes I will chug coffee and whenever possible I will Vats crit until my AP evaporates. For the most part you will be manually aiming with everything but snake. Fighting ultracite terror and putting it down in a reasonable amount of time with criticals uses about 10 coffee per run. If you are with a group, don't use the coffee and don't go for crits too much. Use it when you can, don't worry about it when you can't. There's a lot to explain about why I did what but honest I don't feel like it. Try it out and if you like it use it. If you don't like it, good for you. I am able to solo the raids without difficulty using it though. Using vats crit and my easy lazy carnivore bonuses... I crit for around 6800 PER SHOT on en06. It's dumb. 

 Yes this post Rambles.  No I don't care. If you don't like one of the perks, swap it out. I'm not your mom. For me, these are so frighteningly deadly as to be laughable. Both of them are better than the previous patch, although I do slightly miss using cremator... Gauss minigun is the new king and with demo expert you will be tagging everything no problem anyway. Hail to the King, baby. As I mentioned before, if you shoot anything within 5 ft of you with this gun, you will evaporate. Don't shoot things that close. But I'm used to it from using cremator for so long. 

Anyway, that's all. If you have any questions ask below. If not, enjoy being a Golden God with your miniguns. 

EDIT: if I was not clear... This build is the most fun I have ever had. At least I'm not just sitting there holding crit during a raid. Actually having to aim is pretty fun. I'm also doing approximately 30% MORE damage then I used to do which was already stupid high. 

Double edit: as some commenters have pointed out, I could see a furious pepper shaker easily coming within spitting distance of the damage this build puts out with some minor tweaks to the multi projectile perks in strength. I might run some tests if they put builds on sale with it. Yes I said furious and not quad. You will hit bullet storm stacks without any problem at all thanks to the multi-projectile bonuses. Do not try that with reverse onslaught though. Make sure it is regular onslaught. ",10,1756932789.0,fo76,12,0.86,False

To this day I still have a key to the house to pick them up when arranged with her if she‚Äôs at work, this is the level of trust we‚Äôre talking about here. She and my Mum recently bumped into each other shopping and had a nice catch up conversation. 

Now over the last year when I‚Äôve attended to pick the dogs up, on a few occasions she‚Äôs invited me in, and I‚Äôve even helped her with a few bits around the house, heavy lifting and DIY esque stuff she‚Äôs in the middle of and needs help with, in the Summer she asked if I could help with some heavy lifting in the garden (She has a back injury) then we sat on the patio and had a drink. Sometimes when I return the dogs we end up in the living room talking like we‚Äôre good friends.

A few weeks ago I asked if she‚Äôd like to take the dogs out together and grab a coffee and catch up. She agreed and we had a lovely morning together for a few hours, there was no awkwardness, I‚Äôve never chased for rekindling or tried to pursue anything no strings. 

However, today one of our dogs has not been well the last few days and she arranged for a visit to the ver this morning. I told her a few days ago I‚Äôd come along too, concerned. At 2am this morning she bluntly text me 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come vets tomorrow. It‚Äôll be awkward and weird for me. She‚Äôs feeling better I think it‚Äôs an allergy‚Äù

I replied saying I don‚Äôt appreciate my presence being insulted like that given it hasn‚Äôt been awkward and weird when she‚Äôs asked for help. And that I felt offended and disrespected by her text message at 2am when I‚Äôve made adjustments to my sleep and work schedule (I was coming off a night shift to get to the vets) and she‚Äôs known this for the last 4 days prior, and that obviously this was about OUR dog, not HER dog.

She read it. Ignored it. Then just replied confirming our dog has an allergy and what medication she will be on. Absolutely no acknowledge or apology of what I wrote and how I felt‚Ä¶..

Do I ignore it? Do I chase her up?

1n7qg32,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Oogiebearz23/comments/1n7qg32/the_blur/,The Blur,"As soon as night falls, and the moon comes up. The overweight, inbred man in the muumuu is going to eat me. I can see him in the corner slobbering all over himself, licking his fingers and staring at me cross-eyed. I wish he would start playing the banjo, so I could get a good laugh in before I die. Normally, a short king, nine hundred pound guy, who can not move, would not scare me, like at all. I am not in the greatest shape, but I am fairly confident I could outrun a man too large to move. Unfortunately for me. Nothing about this situation is normal. I left normal at the starting line a long time ago, in a galaxy not that far away, because it was this one, and never looked back.

You see, the overweight inbred man does not live in a trailer park, or a swamp, or the mountains, or the hills. He lives in a mansion. A mansion in Connecticut. Specifically, Greenwich Connecticut‚Äôs Golden Triangle. One of the richest neighborhoods in America. This son of a you know what, lives in thirteen thousand square feet of American awesome. When I was being dragged through one of his living rooms. I saw a one hundred and ten inch curved ultra 16K OLED television. I am not going to lie. The sight of it turned me on, just a little. If I told you his last name, you would not recognize it. We‚Äôre not talking Bill Gates rich. We‚Äôre talking secret rulers of the world rich. Before the Illuminati imploded, this guy's inbred family had a seat on the inner council.

Why would a family of inbred hippo sized people have that kind of clout? Well, it‚Äôs because they are shapeshifters, duh. They have to breed with each other to keep the shapeshifter gene in the family. They are extremely obese because a shapeshifter can only transform whatever mass it already has. So a hundred and fifty pound human can transform into a hundred and fifty pound whatever. A nine hundred pound human can transform into a nine hundred pound death machine.

When in human form, they are overweight, dumb, and slow. When they shift, they are smart, deadly, and fast. It‚Äôs an even trade-off if you ask me. Cows during the day, unstoppable monsters at night. Welcome to the world of the rich and powerful. So now that you know, try not to judge them too hard on all the icky sister cousin loving. Doesn't the bible say only those without sin can cast the first snarky post on their phone?

Now you‚Äôre probably wondering two things. Who am I, and why am I talking to myself? The answer to the second is. I am not talking to myself. I am talking to you. I have created a link between us. Maybe you are reading this on an online forum, or in a book. Maybe it‚Äôs a tall tale being told to you in a bar. Maybe a friend handed you a piece of freshly printed paper, and told you to tell him what you think. Maybe you are reading this on Reddit. Maybe you‚Äôre schizophrenic, and I am a voice in your head. What it boils down to is this. I am uploading my story into your subconscious in case I do, in fact, get eaten.

It‚Äôs a trick I was taught by that wandering immortal lothario St. Germain. If I die and the link is broken, you will be compelled to seek out and tell this tale to a talking Chihuahua. If I live, you will just have really weird dreams for the rest of your life. Either way, you get to touch a world that is so far beyond you, you should count yourself lucky. Hell, I think a thank you is in order. You don‚Äôt want to seem like an ungrateful douche. Do you? Maybe you do. I don‚Äôt know what kind of sick kinks you‚Äôre into.

Now, back to who I am. I am the Blur. Who is the Blur? A fool who had too much time on his hands. Since I had too much time on my hands, I read a lot. Since I read a lot, I thought I was smarter than everyone else. Since I thought I was smarter than everyone else. I wanted to find a way to become better than everyone else. Since I was such a genius, I figured out two ways to achieve my goal. I could build a mini hadron collider in my garage, and smash really tiny protons into myself, or I could find ten magic rings. Being a rational man of science. I believe in evolution and everything. I naturally chose the ten magic rings.

Now, I am going to tell you how I got my ten magic rings. Why? Because there is still time before the sun goes down, and this aforementioned overweight inbred eats me. That‚Äôs why. You for sure, should just listen to everything I say. I am a freaking hero. I have saved the world and everything. Well, I was right next to someone who did one time. Don‚Äôt scoff at me. What have you done? Do you have anything else to do as I invade your mind? Huh, do you? I thought not. It‚Äôs all just complain, complain, complain, from you. I mean, you have not actually said a word. But my point still stands. My point always stands. I am the Blur. I am special. You‚Äôre just you. Get over it and go with the flow. My flow. The first three rings I won in a series of games against three strippers named Strawberry, Peaches, and Cream.

Strawberry is a red-headed, green-eyed, Mongolian girl. I am assuming from Mongolia. Mongolia, if you did not know, is where the Chinese get their beef. Just go to any Chinese restaurant and look at the menu. They all say Mongolian Beef. Once, when she was gyrating on my lap, Strawberry told me she was related to Genghis Khan. I find it highly doubtful she was related to a Star Trek villain, but I did not want to argue with her. Since you know, she was gyrating on my lap. Strawberry and I played a game of Senet. Since lady luck was on my side. I beat her to the afterlife and won the game. So Strawberry gave me the Bramham Moor Ring. Which is a ring made of electrum that makes my blood congeal faster than normal.

Peaches is a brunette with blue eyes from Georgia. The country, not the state. Peaches has, how do I put this, gigantic assets. If you think they grow them big in Texas, they grow them bigger in Georgia. Again, the country, not the state. She once said the reason her assets were so huge was because of a special gene that runs in her family. Her family originally came from someplace called Chernobyl, before they emigrated to Georgia for health reasons. My best guess at the time was that ‚Äòspecial gene‚Äô was a euphemism for plastic surgery, and ‚Äòhealth reasons‚Äô was code for the Georgian health care system being top notch. Sadly, I did not ask any direct questions at the time. I was too busy staring at those assets to actually care. God bless those Georgian titty doctors. Peaches and I played a game of Fidchell. I made sure to wear a blindfold so I would not be distracted, I won easily. One unbroken line later, Peaches gave me the Kingmoor Ring. A gold ring that makes my bones re-knit kind of quickish.

Cream is an albino with pink eyes and white hair from Brazil. Cream and I had a thing for a while. That's how I knew about the rings to begin with. She loved me more than anything. I loved me more than anything. You would think that common interest would make us a perfect match. Alas, it twas not to be. The relationship ended when she caught Strawberry gyrating on my lap while I was staring at Peach‚Äôs assets. I was trying to help out the local flailing economy by supporting an artisanal mom and pop business. Who knew a stripper would be jealous of other professionals in her own line of work. Go figure.

Anywho, Cream and I played a game of Karn√∂ffel. I had Strawberry as a partner, she had Peaches. I was dealt the Karn√∂ffel, the Devil, the Pope, the Kaiser, and the Oberstecher. Since I am sure you are familiar with the game of Karn√∂ffel. I mean, who isn't, right? You know that is a guaranteed winning hand, no matter what anyone else was dealt. From Cream, I got the Linstock Castle Ring. A ring made of agate that when worn in conjunction with the Bramham Moor Ring and the Kingmoor Ring, enhances the attributes of said rings.

Now that I was a little harder to hurt, it was time to get my next ring. I performed a standard evocatio to summon away the deity of the city I was passing through. If you do not know what that is, learn Latin, or go read a book, or Wikipedia, or something. Don't they teach anything in schools anymore? Since the city I was passing through was Chicago. The deity I summoned away was a giant anthropomorphic onion named Garlic. I burned a Packers flag, gave Garlic some deep dish pizza, a beef combo dipped in meat cum, and a Polish sausage with grilled onions and mustard. In return, he told me the current location of Solomon‚Äôs Ring.

So I flew on a plane, not a broom, to Ethiopia. I traveled to the small town of Aksum, where I was challenged to a rap battle by an Ethiopian monk named Kool Moe Dawit. I easily defeated him with my sick rhymes. So he was honor bound to hand over the Ring of Solomon. A brass and iron ring in the shape of a hexagram, that when worn, allows the wearer to control demons and speak to animals and shit. You would never believe how freaking funny dolphins are. It‚Äôs all crude sexual jokes, which is problematic. I do not condone porpoise humor. I only laughed out of politeness.

The next two rings were easy to obtain. Using Solomon‚Äôs Ring, I commanded the demon/fallen angel Abezethibod to go forth and find me a ring that would allow me to travel between worlds. If you have never had the pleasure of meeting Abezethibod, I highly recommend it. It is hilarious. It has only one wing. You should see it try to fly around and do your bidding. It‚Äôs better than having one of those little remote controlled drone things.

Abezethibod returned with two rings. A green ring and a yellow ring. The yellow ring takes me to some crappy place with nothing but woods and no coffee shops. The green ring takes me from the crappy woods with no coffee shops to any other world and time in existence. Sweet and convenient if you ask me. The only downside is, I don't get to rack up all those air miles anymore. There is this all you can eat rib shack in Duluth, Minnesota, that accepts air miles instead of cash, sigh.

With the yellow and green ring, I went on a little tour of the multiverse. I did a lot of awesome things that would make you want to be me. I would tell you about all the things I did, but your head would explode from how cool I am, and we don‚Äôt want that happening yet. I mean ever. So I'll skip to the next ring. I got it from some annoying British guy with glasses and a scar on his head. He was all, I need it to stop some evil guy if he ever returns. When I asked the evil guy's name, he said he couldn't say it. What a loser. So I just took the Marvelous Ghost Non Infringing Copyright Ring from his discarded pants after I introduced him to the goblin redlight district. The Marvelous Ghost Non Infringing Copyright Ring is a gold ring with a black stone that allows whoever is wearing it to communicate and interact with the dead. I needed it to uhmmm, chat, yeah chat. With Marilyn Monroe.

After chatting with Marilyn Monroe, the ghosts of John and Bobby Kennedy started to haunt me for no reason. I thought it was best I should lay low. So I set forth to find rings that would make me invisible. I am a cautious person who believes more is better, so I thought I should get three rings to make me extra super invisible. I traveled to the past and beat the crap out of Plato. He knows why. From him, I obtained the Gyges ring. Next, I watched a play by some guy named Wagner. It was okay, a little long, it took days to perform, but I like to think of myself as sophisticated. From inside his mind, I pulled the Ring of the Nibelung, which besides invisibility, has the added bonus of making me the ruler of the world. The third invisibility ring I caught at the last second before it sunk into a volcano. Some short, barefoot guy with big hairy feet was throwing it in. I guess he never heard of custom made orthopedic shoes. One man's garbage is another man's treasure, I say. Since it was the last ring of invisibility I obtained. I like to call it the one ring to fool them all. Sure, the last ring makes me cranky, but it also makes me feel special and precious.

So that is how I got my ten magic rings. Now you're probably wondering, how does someone as perfect and powerful as me get caught by an inbred, overweight shapeshifter wearing a muumuu? Why don't I use my awesome sauce magic rings to escape? The answer is fairly obvious. The first thing the sister fucking asshole did was bite off my hands. Luckily, as has been mentioned before, I am smarter than everyone else. I foresaw such a problem. The rings have a spell on them that teleports them into a shoe box underneath my bed if they are ever detached from my body. This is a dangerous, thankless job. You can never be too careful. I was sent in to stop these rich cryptozoological large marge fucks from killing and eating virgins. I mean, I do not like to look down on anyone's culture, but orders are orders. The dog wants these guys stopped. I stop them. End of story.

Or is it?

Now that the sun has set. There is no longer an overweight inbred man in a muumuu in front of me. There is an eight foot death machine with fangs, claws, and a big ole dick in front of me. I can see pleasure in his eyes, and glee in his heart. His dick is getting hard. He wants me bad. More than Marilyn did. More than Strawberry, Peaches, and Cream combined. He leaps and tears the gate off my cage. The last thing I want to tell you is this. I am a coward. I do not want to die.

Also, I am a compulsive liar. You see, this connection between us is not just me giving you my story so you can report to the dog in case I die. This connection between us has been open long enough for me to crawl inside your mind and make myself a home. I‚Äôm sorry, I really am. I know I‚Äôm supposed to be one of the good guys, a superhero, but it‚Äôs only because they pay better. The fact of the matter is. I am more important than you are. I am special. My mom and my rings say so. I am the Blur. You‚Äôre probably just a loser. An average joe. I‚Äôm going to make your life mean something. So we‚Äôre switching places now.

Sorry, you‚Äôre about to be screwed over. You might enjoy being shapeshifter food. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not going to be as bad as you think. Once I get my rings back, I‚Äôll probably get around to undoing all this, and making everything copacetic with timey wimey doctor in a phone box shenanigans. It really depends on what new shows are streaming tonight, and whether your junk is bigger or smaller than mine. I just realized you might not even have junk, shit. Hopefully you won‚Äôt remember any of this.

For starters I don't know if I have lyme + co or not as I have not tested, but my functional medicine doctor is treating me for it based on my symptoms. My symptoms are mostly neurological (dizziness, brain fog, POTS, dissociation, air hunger panic attacks, etc) and seem to be MCAS/Histamine related, and I have been having them since October 2024 (11 months). My symptoms are debilitating in the morning but I often feel better in the evening

First we thought it may be mold since it started close to when I moved into a new place. I moved home to my parents, and my job let me work remote this past summer. We did the mold treatment for 3 months, but it didn't seem to help my symtpoms at all (we used Biocidn LDF, Binders, and Probiotics).

So she then suspected we are dealing with Lyme or a tick-borne illness, so we started 6 weeks of Doxycycline 100mg twice a day on August 1st with plans of doing herbal treatment afterwards. I eat an organic, low-histamine diet, I've quit alcohol and sugar, and I drink one cup of coffee a day black. I take Quercetin, NAC, a probiotic, charcoal binders, and Magnesium Glycinate. I have definitely experienced die-off and an increase in my symptoms while on the abx.

That brings us to today. I moved to Boston on September 1st and was scheduled to return to working in my office today, as life must go on. My work is hybrid, with every other week being remote, you must be in the office the weeks you are scheduled (unless you have an exception like I did this summer). I had a HUGE flair on moving day, and haven't been able to sleep through the night the past 2 days. I went into my office today, and I was so dizzy, my hands were numb, and I was trying my hardest not to have a panic attack sitting at my desk. I eventually had to head home and use half of a sick day. I used to be able to use Zyrtec and Pepcid on days like this and get through it, but those haven't worked recently.

After talking with my doctor we are stopping the doxycycline, but I am laying in bed terrified that my condition has gotten worse, and I will not become stable enough to work in-person in the near future. And as my company requires it, I am in fear for my job security. It's a shame because I work very hard and I love my job and my co-workers, but I don't think I can keep asking for remote exceptions. Before treatment, my mornings were still rough but I was able to work in person no problem

I'm looking for any advice to help me get stable. My game plan is obviously to stop the doxycycline, I ordered DAO enzyme to maybe stabilize my reactions, and I am drinking some ginger tea. I also plan on doing some Igenex tests once the doxy is out of my system, and starting Buhrner herbs in the next few weeks (very slowly). I know I will get better, I am a painfully optimistic person, but this stage is very hard.

TLDR; Lyme treatment with abx has exacerbated my MCAS symptoms, making it very hard to work in-person and I need advice to be stable enough to work again.

Any help is so appreciated, sorry for the long post. Thank you so much in advance <3",1,1756932286.0,Lyme,3,1.0,False

About two weeks ago, I started a low-carb/keto-like diet. Everything was fine in the first days, no issues at all. But last Friday, while I was sitting on the couch drinking my coffee, I suddenly noticed these ‚Äúskipped‚Äù or ‚Äúthumping‚Äù heartbeats and started to panic. I asked ChatGPT, and it said it matches the description of PVCs exactly, which made a lot of sense.

I went to the lab to check my electrolytes. Sodium and magnesium came back fine, but my potassium was borderline low. I figured that must be the problem, so I started taking NoSalt (potassium salt) by the spoonful, morning and evening, and also cut down on coffee. But it didn‚Äôt really make a difference.

Interestingly, I don‚Äôt feel it at all when I‚Äôm standing, walking, or exercising, only when I sit down, and especially if I lean back, it hits hard, sometimes back to back.

Has anyone else experienced PVCs after starting a low-carb diet?

Instead of just hitting the usual spots post office, war museum, Ben Thanh market, I joined a local walking tour and it turned into the most authentic part of my trip. We started with breakfast in a family‚Äôs home tucked in a small alley simple dishes that were somehow better than anything I‚Äôd had in restaurants. After that, we explored an old apartment block where people still run tiny caf√©s out of their living rooms. Sitting there with strong Vietnamese coffee while listening to stories about the building‚Äôs history was honestly magical.

What I loved most was how personal it felt. My guides, Spring and Hieu, speak great English and are super easygoing. They joked around, introduced me to shopkeepers they grew up with, and answered all the random questions I had about daily life. It felt less like a tour and more like hanging out with friends who just happen to know all the best spots.

We also wandered through wet markets, where they explained ingredients and local food culture. Zero tourist traps, no pushy sales just genuine moments.

I saw at a sandwich place the same brand of energy drink I drank at a geek convention, and felt semi-tempted to buy it.



Not because I would have felt any noticeably stronger caffeine rush. I don't recall enough distinction to tell. I've probably built up a tolerance to caffeine.



Not because I would have preferred the taste. If anything, given enough cream and sweetener, coffee tastes better. (Actually, I used to be ashamed of how much more coffee than tea I drink because of said difference in taste. Not as ashamed of it now, though.)



But because it would be a taste that reminded me of that geek convention, just as the scent of cigarette butts in a washroom reminds me of Shanghai.



I am... semi-concerned about this. I am semi-concerned that I, ostensibly an adult, was able to get sentimental about what was effectively a drug, if a milder one than heroin or crystal meth, how easily this can be made marketable to kids by putting animesque visuals on the stand where they're sold, especially if coffee is the exact same price, isn't actively advertised in that manner at that stand, and is marginally more time-consuming to make yummier than said energy drink by finding the cream and sweetener and some unused surface somewhere in the vicinity to stir them, etc...



We know that, as caffeine sources go, coffee is healthier than energy drinks, if only for coming with antioxidants. It has centuries more precedent than energy drinks do. So why aren't we incorporating that difference into the pricing? We have cigarette taxes, alcohol taxes, etc... why not taxes on caffeine to antioxidant ratios at odds with the caffeine to antioxidant ratio in mother nature's caffeine source, to incentivize the healthier option? We know that where coffee is only available hot, and energy drinks are available cold, people will opt for the cold energy drinks at a searingly warm convention floor, so why not use a tax to shape the laws of supply and demand until it's more profitable to provide iced coffee than not to?",0,1756931612.0,PoliticalOpinions,2,0.25,False

1n7q2q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1n7q2q2/guide_how_long_does_it_take_to_see_results_from_a/,(Guide) How long does it take to see results from a reflux-friendly diet?,"Hey everyone, my last writeup was pretty popular (really glad some found it so helpful!) so I figured I‚Äôd do another one. This short guide is about something I see asked a lot in comments/posts here: ‚ÄúI changed my diet to be more reflux-friendly, but how quickly should I expect my symptoms to improve or go away?‚Äù

This is definitely a reasonable question to ask; many of us have jobs, relationships, etc that our reflux is impacting, and we want to get back to normal ASAP. Hopefully this will encourage you and keep you focused, whether you‚Äôre following something like the Acid Watchers Diet or a similar plan. From my experience, these are the common things I‚Äôve seen:

1. Early relief CAN come within days or a week or two, but it‚Äôs usually not full relief

When you first switch to a reflux-safe diet (essentially cutting out triggers like coffee, chocolate, fried foods, alcohol, etc.), I know of a lot of people who feel at least some relief in only a few days. A big reason for that is because some triggers act like immediate irritants, and by removing them, you‚Äôre removing some of the main things that may be causing your symptoms.

However, this early relief is not quite the same as long-term healing. People who have had reflux for a while typically have an inflamed/irritated esophagus, which takes longer than just a few days to heal. So even with the right diet, patience is key here- if you notice improvement in the first week, that‚Äôs great, but don‚Äôt be discouraged if symptoms don‚Äôt disappear right away. Also note that some people may take longer than a few days before they start to feel early relief, especially if their reflux is more serious or they have other gut health problems.

2. Expect better results (and actual healing) to take at least a few weeks

A reflux-safe diet usually doesn‚Äôt fully impact you until after around 3‚Äì6 weeks of consistency (depending on how severe your reflux/GERD is). After a few weeks pass, this is when inflammation in the esophagus usually has had enough time to reduce (assuming you stayed consistent), and your digestive system had adjusted to your new diet.

During this period, from my experience combining diet changes with other strategies (meal timing, portion control, not lying down right after eating, elevating your bed, etc.) can really help speed up results. Many people also find it really helps to track their symptoms and diet with an app like NoBurn, Bearable, etc or with a journal/notes. The main thing you should be focusing on here is consistency. Even small comprises (like late-night pizza, or wine, or one of your specific triggers) can cause setbacks and make it seem like the safe diet isn‚Äôt working.

3. Long-term stability usually takes months, but it almost always comes eventually 

For a lot of people, it takes several months a disciplined diet (and making necessary lifestyle adjustments) to feel like their reflux is under control. If you‚Äôve had reflux for a long time, or if you also have a complication like a hiatal hernia or esophagitis, note that it may take longer. Also, some people find that a diet alone isn‚Äôt enough, and use medications (like PPIs or H2 blockers) temporarily while their esophagus heals. This is OKAY to do and is often expected, and often why medical professionals prescribe the medication in the first place!

The important thing is not to expect a cure in one or two weeks. Reflux-safe diets work, but they work gradually. Again, with consistency, a combination of diet, lifestyle changes, and (when needed) meds is almost always enough for you to have both short-term relief and long-term stability. The only caveats here are physical issues like a hiatal hernia (which could need surgery) and having other gut conditions (some of which may require a different approach than reflux, and be needed to heal before you can tackle your reflux); either of these may lengthen the process of healing. 

Stick with whatever works for you, and don‚Äôt get discouraged if your timeline looks different from someone else‚Äôs. Everyone‚Äôs reflux is a little different. Hope this helped!",1,1756931470.0,GERD,0,0.67,False

My brother who is 14M has a job at this cafe in the town we live in and he acts all superior because he has a job that pays him ¬£5 an hour and he always calls me lazy, so I politely asked him if he could put in a word about me because I have over a years worth of experience doing voluntary work and he was like 'no just go down with your cv'- the thing is in my area I swear you can only get jobs through connections and if a company says they're hiring you apply and they never get back to you.

Anyways, my siblings just find anything to make fun of me for, they'll be like 'oh remember when\_\_(I don't want to put my name on here) did this ages ago it was so funny she's so dumb' at the most random times, or today I was making a coffee for myself and I was pouring boiling water into a mug and my sister was getting in the way annoying me and asking random things so I said 'oh I'm just pouring hot water and don't want to hurt myself' and she yelled at me saying I was rude 24/7 and no wonder I don't have friends.

1n7q1bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n7q1bm/aitah_for_accidentally_being_creepy/,AITAH for accidentally being creepy,"So some context about me: was in a long relationship from freshman year of college, like the 3rd one I‚Äôve ever been in. 8 years later, we broke up (on good terms, our careers took us in different directions). I‚Äôve never ‚Äùchased‚Äù a girl before because I didn‚Äôt want to freak someone out by being creepy‚Ä¶in college and high school it was always more or less a friendship and then they decide to make out with me at some point. But now I‚Äôm single and in NYC where I feel like you gotta chase it because everyone‚Äôs too damn busy.

Anyway, the point is, any girl I‚Äôve ever flirted with, I‚Äôve known for sure they were into me. I was always concerned with coming off as creepy, especially because I felt like I was a relatively unattractive Indian guy, and we already have that stereotype about us.

Anyway so since we broke up, I‚Äôve really been focused on myself‚Ä¶doing my best at work, hitting the gym consistently, and developing my skills/hobbies. It‚Äôs paid off a bit, I look about the best I‚Äôve ever been, and I‚Äôm pretty happy. Friends tell me that I look good which is super nice to hear, even if they are obviously biased.

I just don‚Äôt like being alone. Doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm pretty picky in general since, as I mentioned, every girl I‚Äôve been with is someone I truly loved and clicked with on a physical, humor, emotion, and intellect level.

Anyway, so I was heading back into my apartment after doing laundry and smoking a cheeky little evening J, when I see this absolutely stunning girl. I can‚Äôt help but check her out, and I notice her looking at me too. Like a couple times. Then we get in the elevator and lo, everyone gets off except us, and there‚Äôs only one floor left. I sensed some tension between us, but we weren‚Äôt looking at each other so idk if it was real or I was just insanely attracted to her and getting my wires crossed. I let her get off first and she turns around, looks me right in the eyes, and gives me this beautiful smile. 

I felt like I should have said something then, but I was high as balls and kind of paranoid that my eyes were red. As I got back to my apartment I was just mourning the missed opportunity because maybe they do for some guys, but chances like that don‚Äôt really fall out of the sky for me. This is where I fucked up.

I was like ‚Äúohhh what do I do, I can‚Äôt knock on her door at 9:30 pm that‚Äôs rude but I also don‚Äôt want to wait to accidentally run into her in the hallway again‚Äù. So I was like ‚Äúoh I know, I‚Äôll drop her a note‚Äù. Dumb move. 

I wrote her a note, but I think I went wayyyy too hard calling her ‚Äúthe cutie in apartment XYZ‚Äù and telling her that her smile made my heart stop. It‚Äôs almost a reflex because that‚Äôs how I used to talk to my girl. I realize I haven‚Äôt said a word to this girl.

Anyway, I gave her my number and told her to text me if she wants to get to know each other better, but I did say ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not into it we can just pretend this didn‚Äôt happen and be polite strangers who pass each other in the hallway‚Äù.

Somehow at no point in this process did this seem like a bad idea. I wake up at 5 am for jiu jitsu and I had a coffee at work because I was working late so I was pretty sleep deprived when I decided to slip it under her doorway. Not an excuse but I do think it was a factor. Also she really is stunning and I was thinking with my dick a little.

Anyway, since this morning I have been replaying my note to her in my head and realizing how creepy it sounds, especially from someone who lives on your floor so it‚Äôs not like you can really avoid them. Now I am literally what I never wanted to be‚Ä¶the creep at the end of the hall. What an insane fuckup. 

Any advice on how to fix this? Maybe just ignoring the fact that it ever happened is an option. Should I apologize? I‚Äôm dreading the possibility of running into her in the hallway.",2,1756931386.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

I'm 21, a college student (biology), and I really don't see the end of the tunnel. I have no brothers or sisters, and my parents are not good when it comes to health condition. For these 21 years, I haven't learned a single useful skill. It's part due to my laziness, but it's also because my parents were basically treating me as a prince. They were always telling me that my only job is to study hard. And now... I feel worthless. I wouldn't be able to work even as a waiter because of my clumsiness. I really want to help my parents, and myself also, but I don't know where to begin.

I have no friends, also. No matter how hard I tried to blend in, to smile and laugh, to keep conversations of other people, it wasn't enough. Don't get me wrong, I speak with people, they help me and I help them, I even go out for a coffee with them, but it's always ""inside college business"". Social life outside college basically doesn't exist for me (I am actually inside of a pub quiz group, but all of them are older than me, so we don't have compatible conversations, and every one of them either already have someone, so I stick out like a sore thumb). I tried to go to some alternative clubs, but I always changed my mind at the last moment.

Two things that I will cover now are really big problem for me: first - I am a masochist, in sexual way, and society where I am is primarily man-oriented (patriarchy), and it would be ultra-humiliating if I said to a girl that I like being dominated in bed. She would discard me in an instant. Second thing is that I have body dysmorphia, and the reason for that is that I have a really noticeable post-acne scars, and when I say they are noticeable, THEY ARE. It looks like I have been burned, and my dermatoligist said that my skin will never fully recover. My parents spent a good amount of money for laser treatments and stuff like that, but it didn't really help in the end. We don't have money for plastic or reconstructive surgery, and I think that we don't have any specialists for that in my country.

So, in the end: I don't have friends or girlfriend, or skills for gaining something useful, parts of my face look disgusting, my fetishes are destroying me, and my luck is good as a dead horse.

I have some good qualities, but most of the time they are outshined by bad ones.

1n7puus,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1n7puus/finding_a_church_that_is_right_for_me_in_sweden/,Finding a church that is right for me (in Sweden),"I was raised Catholic in Italy, but without attending church often. My family has never been particularly religious. Given my makeup, however, I could easily join a very strict denomination. Some say Mormons and JWs are high demand, but I tend to be much more extremist. I've never had sex, never kissed, I don't watch porn, I don't drink coffee or alcohol, I don't use tobacco, I always dress classic, and I have no tattoos, piercings, etc. 

Now I'll list all the points I don't approve of in the various denominations I've seen here.

Catholics. Excessive focus on saints, excessive forgiveness, too much openness to modernity and multiculturalism. I appreciated figures like Vigan√≤, who, however, was excommunicated for criticizing the pope.

Lutherans. The whole idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfaith alone opens the way to accepting everything. And in Sweden, the Lutheran Church approves of divorce, gay marriage, abortion, etc.

LDS (Mormons). The first ones were fairly well-founded, but doctrine based on permanent revelations opens the way to constant contradictions. Just as God has changed his view on mixed marriages in the 70s, just as he has changed his view on excommunications for premarital sex, modesty, and rituals, it risks becoming too lax over the years. And for me, joining a church is a long-term investment. I have very clear ideas, but I want to find a wife with similar views, and I want my children to grow up in a community with similar, unchanging values.

JW. Strange doctrine, I don't like their desire to erase Easter, Christmas, and the symbol of the cross. And I don't like their pacifism.",2,1756930982.0,TrueChristian,15,0.75,False
1n7ptip,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n7ptip,Hi guys Taurin + L-Theanine,"Hi this year is my big exam year, i have yks (turkish S.A.T. exam)
And i had some serious problems with stress And I can't focus. I was in such a depression phase a few months ago that I started having hallucinations. With Redepra and Rexapin, I had hallucinations (sometimes audio, sometimes visual) 3-4 times a month.
It went away, but the depression remained. When the hallucinations stopped, I stopped taking the medication. Anyway, as I said, I'm having trouble focusing. I need a supplement that will reduce my stress and significantly improve my focus and learning. I'm considering 3 doses of 2 grams of Taurine per day, so the effects will last throughout the day while I'm working (taurine's effects last 5 hours in humans, and I'm thinking 2-3 grams per dose for a slightly more effective dose).
+
L-Theanine
I'm thinking of taking 200mg in the morning + coffee and
200mg in the evening, 3 hours before bed. Do you think this would significantly help me? It might sound a bit cringe-inducing, but I noticed a feeling of relief and focus an hour after taking Monster. When I researched it, I discovered it was from taurine and L-Theanine. I learned about both on a forum. I've researched both extensively. Don't worry, but if anyone has tried it, your opinions are very important to me.

I know I need to take a week off every 2-3 months.

Do you think this makes sense, or is it something like:
""Stress
Difficulty concentrating
Supposed to make learning easier""
Do you have a better suggestion?

1n7psvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1n7psvx/day_33_unleashed/,Day 33 - unleashed,"I‚Äôve done a few sober months over the years but today marks the longest I have made it since I went to college (30M). This experience has been profound at times but honestly very predictable. I knew for a long time that ‚Äúman if I would just stop drinking like this I would be crushing it‚Äù and to no one‚Äôs surprise it turned out to be 1000% true. 

Here‚Äôs what being sober has enabled me to do: 

- Working out consistently and already look the best I have in years. Compliments tend to make me uncomfortable but the ‚Äúwow you look great have you been going to the gym‚Äù is THE most gratifying thing. 

- Sleep quality is immeasurably better. 7-8 hours and most days I can get out of bed at 6am and go straight into a morning routine of electrolytes, walk outside, stand in sunlight, high protein breakfast, make coffee, and still get to the office early. Look up Andrew Huberman‚Äôs morning protocol and do it consistently for one week. It‚Äôs crazy how easy it can be to have a great day every day if you simply put your brain and body in a position to operate the best they can. 

- I‚Äôm in a great place with my job. On top of to-dos, clear communication with colleagues, more confidence with clients, and not at all tweaking or overthinking what/how I said or did something. Work-related stress was one of my biggest drivers for drinking but all it did was make me less effective at my job and create a vicious cycle of cope-crash-catchup-cope etc etc 

- Overall mood is solid. Stable, calm and just‚Ä¶.solid. I‚Äôm not euphoric or enlightened or anything like that ‚Äî though I have had a few days where I‚Äôm in such a good state of mind it feels like someone slipped me an adderrall.

So here‚Äôs the thing I know now and the best ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù I can offer if you are just starting out:

Sobriety will not simply gift you a better life. Sobriety will grant you the opportunity to make one. Don‚Äôt bother waiting around for motivation and joy to arrive, because they‚Äôre not coming. You MUST put the work in. Everything you need for this journey is already within you. And trust me it cannot wait to be unleashed.

1n7pqbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlcoholFree/comments/1n7pqbn/changing_my_life/,Changing my life,"I'm 25 M 
Alcohol caused nothing but problems from me 
Even in the problems that created i thought 
Drinks is solution to ease my mind 
I tried to quit alcohol
I lasted upto 3 to 4 days then I am back at it again
With more speed 
Started alcohol while drinking in college 
But that used be at moderation friends around me moderate drinkers we use to make fun of people who drink daily he will damage his liver early or something 
But now that I am alone since 1 year 
The friends I roam around with now are toxic 
Eat brains of me give me more irritation even when I try to cut off those people 
Loneliness is the problem now I'm facing because the friends that I used to since 1 years are totally shit 
Because I invested my time in wrong people. And i cutt off because they of irritation and focus on life
Now that I am all clear 
I will drink my last drink on 5 th sept after completing every pending work only 
5th will my last day of drinking alcohol as an alcoholic 
While I was battling this thing I found its loopholes i guess 
1)never drink alone And don't drink with people who drinks all the time 
2)don't make up unccessary reasons for drinking 
And don't justify yourself that I am drinking because of this reason.
3)never drink because no one understands you. That will make you more sad but the problem with this is 
U need to vent out your emotions somewhere 
I found online game valorent and all are best way to vent out feelings as they don't take anyone seriously and people are generally toxic and it's casual there 
Don't bottle your feelings up vent it out but not to people that are close to you . Vent it on Twitter or someting or reddit maybe.
4) consider bar as unholy places where people eat bad food or people pay to die early u should feel the disgut like gutter . God has given this life to live  ur reducing that life 
What would God feel about you he will be sad I guess 
Already life span of human beings is reducing 
Plus extra life span reduce .
5)some people say think of parents and all but addiction doesn't work that way u started it knowing that u have parents so it doesn't help much that's temporary. U should think about yourself all the more fun you can do girls u can check out 
U can talk or fun things u can do like movies , more exciting stuff learning new stuffs in life through YouTube it doesn't matter maybe whistle maybe to yo it always doesn't have to be big .
6) people say instead of drinking u can buy this that 
But it doesn't work that way that's why it's called addiction it will drain your pockets and empty .
7) chips lemons food certain foods reduce cravings
Eat ice cream , a apple or orange  coffee people don't usually drink after having fruit ice cream brain already have bad experiences drinking after certain foods generally.
8)don't fall for peer pressure stuff 
Don't replace ur drinking addiction with weed or something . 
9) some people say u should know your alcoholic 
Realize and acknowledge you have a problem 
That's bullshit you should not consider yourself 
Alcoholic first if u made that Identity of yours into reality u will more likely to not drink daily.
10) if ur going for drink on 7 pm usually after quitting workout at 6 pm 1 hrs before 7 pm hardcore 
U will vomit there even if u go for drink cause stomach will through it out 
11) cut out negative people from life 
Your already going through something u don't need other people stress 

Imp notice:-  reset your instagram feeds before quitting alcohol and unfollow drinking related contents reset everything related to alcohol in your phone 
Don't feel like it's task that I'm doing quitting alcohol 
It will more likely to feel burden counting days 
Just don't think of it that much . Consider yourself a non drinker 

Alcohol doesn't suit my personality 
People are idiots who think alcohol is cool 
 Reality:-Being healthy is the actual flex now people appreciating those who live healthy and workout 
Higher standards  high life 
Alcohols are low standards 
Don't talk to drunk people that much after quitting talk them while they sober up 

My way of life  now :---

I have decided 
That from tomorrow that is 5th September I will cut my hair in saloon clean look 
Bath after that.
 I will drink my last sip of alcohol not just any but good alcohol lets quit with a bang . I'll have good food after that 
And before sleep ill take hot water bath 
And ors juices hyderation day after for hangover recovery. 
Then its over 
I'll read books Play online games 
Wisdom and fun are the only thing that are actually cure me i know 


I'n life there will come certain times where u have to
Be in a party 
1)I will  not go for parties where I don't know people if barley known person invites you also 
2) I am not stay longer if person invites you just meet them show them your  presence drink redbull say I have some some where I need to be i will not let anyone peer pressure me . 2nd This is for person u know but not that close 
3) closes ones
Depends upon their achievements or celebration 
That will more likely to happen once in a Blue moons
I will try drink redbull 
If not possible i will drink red wine üç∑ that day 
Never whisky rum other drinks and beer also it has better taste i will roll back 
Again start from zero 
Its such a hectic thing to start from zero it doesn't suit my personality i guess .

That's how I will successfully quit alcohol 

No more self sabotage. No more harming my body 
I will not go back that shit hole living shitty life blaming others for my own downfall.

Hope somewhere this will help someone 
The reality and facts I faced and life lessons i learnt from 18 to 25 years old my life that is  7 years

The September 5 gathering will close with two cultural dances and an official city-approved Murray Baker Bridge lighting in black, white, green, and red Palestine colors in celebration of indigenous resilience. 



‚ÄúAfter nearly two years of witnessing a genocide, and having our pleas ignored by local, state, and federal leaders, we continue to bring awareness to our communities through various activities such as this peaceful September 5 riverfront gathering,‚Äù Dr. Tara Wood of PFP added. 



‚ÄúOur hope is that we can open the eyes of those who have yet to see or accept the crimes against humanity being committed upon the people of Palestine at the hands of the Israeli government through the military and political support of the United States.‚Äù
