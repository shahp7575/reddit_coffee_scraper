A bit about me: I’m in my late 20s, Filipino, Manila girlie, and now living in the Bay Area! I am currently looking for a job but I really value meaningful downtime and good company. I enjoy exploring new food spots, coffee shops, nature drives, scenic walks, casual hikes, and spontaneous weekend plans. I also appreciate deeper conversations just as much as light, fun ones.

I’m looking for genuine friendships—people to grab coffee with, try new restaurants, walk around the city, explore nearby towns, or just talk life. Open to individuals or small groups. —just normal humans looking to connect.

If this resonates with you, feel free to comment or send a message. Happy to start with a simple chat and see where it goes.

or if you have any tips on how to make friends here! please let me knowwww. Appreciate it! ♥️",1,1767324064.0,concord,0,1.0,False

We move to Shane at Ilya’s where deep sea blue is all around them.  Blue paint on the entry wall, blue sheets on the bed and that gorgeous deep blue sofa.  There is also a sea creature-ish piece front and center on the coffee table. When Shane rejects Ilya, we see the incredible pain of that moment, the lacerating sting of it, wash over Ilya’s face.

Photo 1: the farm is highly biodiverse, they believe in a polycultural approach to growing coffee, among the many coffee trees, one can also find banana, guava, avocado trees, many flowering trees, and so on, to promote health of the soil and draw pollinators.

Photo 3: some coffee cherries, I'm not sure which variety it is. I think Gesha but not 100% sure.

Photo 4: the entrance of the wet mill leads to the machines where the coffee is processed.

Photo 5: the whole area is beautiful, canopies of trees and mountains in the distance.

I am 71 years old and have been writing a memoir about my years as a traveling salesman in the 1970s and 80s, a job that no longer exists in the same form and which I thought might be interesting to document for younger generations.

The writing itself was enjoyable and I looked forward to it every morning with my coffee. The technical aspects of publishing were considerably less so and I will admit I got quite frustrated at times. I spent several weeks trying to understand how to get ISBN for my book, what the difference between print and ebook formatting is, how distribution actually works, and a dozen other questions that nobody seemed to answer in plain English.

My daughter eventually convinced me to stop torturing myself with the technical details and just work with a publisher who could handle it. After researching several options I chose palmetto and honestly it was the right decision for me. They registered the ISBN under my name so I still own it, handled all the copyright paperwork, formatted both the print and ebook versions, and set up distribution to Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and other retailers. I simply reviewed and approved things as we went along which was much more manageable than trying to learn it all myself.

The entire process took about four months and my book is now available wherever books are sold. I have ordered several cases of copies to give to family and old colleagues. For anyone else who finds the technical side overwhelming I would encourage you to get help rather than struggling through it alone, there is no shame in admitting you would rather focus on the writing and let professionals handle the rest.",1,1767323520.0,Memoir,0,1.0,False

1q1ngbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Procrastinationism/comments/1q1ngbg/you_fall_to_the_level_of_your_environment/,You fall to the level of your environment,"We need to talk about why ""just have more willpower"" is terrible advice. I recently discovered research on environment design, and it completely changed how I think about habit formation. It explained exactly why I can't resist eating chips when they're visible on the counter, but have no cravings when they're hidden in a cabinet.

If you feel like you're constantly fighting against your own actions despite your best intentions, read this.

1. The Visibility Effect (Why willpower always fails)

The research I found explained that environment design isn't just helpful for habit change; it's the primary driver.

Every object in your visual field creates a psychological ""pull"" on your attention and behavior. The more visible something is, the more likely you are to engage with it. The problem is that most of us default-design our spaces for convenience rather than for our goals.

When your environment is working against your intentions:

Your willpower depletes rapidly throughout the day.

Your best-laid plans crumble in the face of visible temptations.

Your goals feel impossibly difficult despite your genuine desire to achieve them.

You aren't just ""undisciplined."" You have created an environment that makes bad habits easy and good habits difficult.

2. The Path of Least Resistance

Beyond the visual cues, there is the friction factor. The harsh reality is: ""Humans will nearly always choose the option with the least resistance, regardless of their stated values.""

We say we want to read more, but leave books on shelves while keeping our phones in our pockets. We claim we want to eat healthier, but store vegetables in crisper drawers while keeping snacks at eye level.

This constant battle against your own environment drains the mental energy you need to actually work toward meaningful change.

3. How to ""Design, Don't Decide"" (The Fix)

The only sustainable way forward is to redesign your environment. The goal is to shift from a Willpower Mindset to a Design Mindset. Here is the protocol I'm using to reshape my behavior without relying on motivation:

Phase 1: Friction Audit  
You need to identify where your environment is working against you.

The Rule: Analyze how many steps it takes to perform both good and bad habits in your current setup.

The Goal: Recognize that your ""choices"" are largely determined by the paths of least resistance in your environment.

Phase 2: The ""20-Second Rule""  
Make bad habits take 20 seconds longer and good habits 20 seconds faster.

Put the TV remote in a drawer rather than on the coffee table.

Set out workout clothes the night before.

Pre-cut vegetables and place them at eye level in the fridge.

The Shift: Even tiny amounts of added friction dramatically change behavior patterns.

Phase 3: Prime Your Spaces  
Your environment should trigger the right behaviors automatically.

Create activity zones (reading chair with no devices allowed, dedicated workout corner).

Use visual cues (water bottle on desk, fruit bowl on counter).

Remove competing stimuli (no TV in bedroom, no phone during meals).

Treat your environment like a behavior programming system. You wouldn't expect software to run without the right code; don't expect your habits to change without the right cues.",1,1767323378.0,Procrastinationism,0,1.0,False

Robot mops have become game-changers for people who want clean floors without the hassle.

**What Makes a Robot Mop Perfect for Small Spaces?**

You need a robot mop that can navigate tight corners and fit under furniture. The best models for apartments are compact, quiet, and smart enough to avoid getting stuck between your couch and coffee table.

**Key Features to Look For**

When choosing a robot mop for your apartment, focus on these important features:

- **Slim design** - Look for models under 3 inches tall that can slide under beds and sofas
- **Smart navigation** - Advanced sensors help avoid furniture and clean efficiently 
- **Quiet operation** - Your neighbors will thank you for choosing a quiet robot mop
- **Good battery life** - Should clean your entire apartment on one charge
- **Easy maintenance** - Simple water tank refilling and pad cleaning

**Top Robot Mop Options**

Several robot mops work great in small apartments. The iRobot Braava series excels at wet and dry mopping in compact spaces. The Roborock models offer excellent navigation and can handle both vacuuming and mopping.

For budget-conscious renters, basic mopping robots still do a solid job on hard floors. They might not have all the smart features, but they'll keep your floors clean.

You can check out some of the best-rated options at [this helpful comparison page](https://athomewave.com/robot-mop) that shows different models and their features.

**Making the Right Choice**

Consider your apartment's layout when picking a robot mop. If you have lots of furniture, prioritize navigation features. For studio apartments, a basic model might work just fine.

Most robot mops handle tile, hardwood, and laminate floors well. They're not meant for deep carpet cleaning, but they're perfect for the hard surfaces common in apartments.

**Getting Started**

Once you choose your robot mop, setup is usually straightforward. Clear the floor of small items, fill the water tank, and let it map your space. Most models learn your apartment's layout after a few cleaning cycles.

I am doing weight training.  I'm eating as healthy as possible.  I'm FINALLY feeling like I'm going to get my health back.

Over this time, my heart also took a crap, got that fixed and managed but cannot do coffee or ANY kind of sugar/stimulant.  Which also does not help for weight loss.

Then menopause hit and I almost bled to death.  No kidding.  hemmoragged so badly I almost died.  Left me with bad anemia where I had to have blood transfusions and iron transfusions.  The anemia made it almost impossible to breathe.  Apparently, when you have no iron and your CBC's are in the toilet (blood volume), your lungs don't have enough blood to work correctly.  So you basically can walk about ten feet before you are wheezing and gasping for breath.  So obvs.....I've gained a ton of weight.  I'm still not able to breathe well but i'm pushing it.

He has a hair trigger and is ALWAYS unhappy and angry.

""I don't want your big fat belly in the picture!""  He yelled at me.

That's all it took.  I literally turned off to this plate of food like it was worms.  And then I couldn't eat it.  And he was like, ""Aren't you hungry?""  And I was like, ""I am hungry.""  But I could not eat it and I just handed him the plate.  We didn't speak for the rest of the night.

I felt like someone just handed me a plate of food and then said, ""Enjoy it you fn fat ass.""

I don't think I will ever be able to eat this recipe again.'

I didn't speak to him or look at him for the rest of the night and just went to bed in a seperate room.

I had 1 cavity at 16 yo during my first pregnancy. I didn’t have any cavities for 11 years after that. Have always had great dental health and go every 6 months, was always complimented on my perfect teeth and no issues. I then was pregnant with my second child at 27 yo and also moved to another area and switched dentists. Starting in 2023 every single year, sometimes every 6 months, I have had cavities to be filled. Just 2 weeks ago I went (mind you I already had 2 fillings this summer) and was told I had 2 superficial cavities and 2 deeper ones between molars. On top of that last week I noticed my front tooth is chipped and it had to have happened within the last 7 days.

It literally feels like my teeth are falling apart when I do everything I should. I could blame pregnancy but like when do the cavities end? When I had an appointment during my pregnancy I had no cavities or gum issues, this all started postpartum. I did breastfeed for 21 months but I’m now 3 yrs postpartum and have really dove into caring for my teeth like never before when the cavities just kept coming but it hasn’t seemed to stop it. I also vaped disposable vapes (went through 1 every 3 weeks) for about a year but I quit vaping 8 months ago. I do whiten my teeth but usually just a few times a month with gel and a light. My teeth aren’t super sensitive. 

My kids and bf also go to this dentist (granted it is a chain office) and none of the have had any cavities diagnosed… but my kids have Medicaid and my bf is uninsured so I’m the only one with a commercial plan through my work. I don’t know if this would cause over diagnosing. I’m genuinely considering getting my dental records and taking a day to go 2.5 hrs to my old dentist to have him look and/or do any work. 

Things I do for oral health:

Brush 2x a day with electric toothbrush, floss last (coat it in toothpaste), use a water pick first, alternate flouride and hydroxyapatite toothpaste, MI paste a couple times a week at night. I don’t drink soft drinks or coffee regularly, maybe a sweet drink other than water 2-3 times a week max but I don’t have anything daily. I chew xylitol gum and drink water regularly each day. Just started using a mouth guard because I grind my teeth and I’m worried that’s what chipped my front tooth. I take a multivitamin but just started taking additional D3+K2 to help with calcium absorption. My most recent visit I paid OOP for flouride treatment that I requested.

We're not?","For starters I (F 30) used to have a strong friendship with ""Delilah"" (F 30). She and I are younger than most of the friend group (men and women of 34+ years old now) but it never really mattered. My husband is part of the ""older"" crowd and that's how we met, through me joining his friend group. She and I were very close. Going to the gym and on hikes together. Impromptu coffee dates. I would cheer her and my husband on in bowling leagues. College was fun. But then we all grew up. Except for Delilah.

Fast forward to present day, my husband and I BOTH are still in friend groups from our high school and college friends. We all have very strong roots and I realize how unusual it is to keep so many close friends from those days. But I hope that speaks to the kind of people we like to spend time with and the kind of people we are. However, I got married, bought a house, got a dog, got a job, had a baby, etc. and Delilah is trying to make her own business happen. She lives with her fiance and his mom who support her and she has no true income. However, if she's able to pursue her passions, by all means. I support that.

What I *don't* support is that she sent out a mass text to everyone in this friend group saying that she feels left out, that everyone is excluding her from plans, and that this must be the natural progression of things. She ended by saying she's happy that we all have the friendship support we need, inferencing that she doesn't have this.

Now... I'm a mom. I'm a wife. I'm an employee. I'm tired. Very tired of drama and BS from every facet of all my lives past and present and future. She lives about an hour and a half away from the closest friends now, since she moved in with her fiance and his mom. They only ever invite people up to them in large groups and it's always a potluck, so we not only have to cargo our baby and all his stuff with us now, but now we're responsible for bringing something to feed everyone there. The first few times are cute. But every get together being like this gets old.

My husband and I used to throw very large and ridiculous parties, but that stopped a couple of years ago when we decided to settle down and start trying for a baby. Now we occasionally host a small game night impromptu, or we have a few very very close friends that we invite last minute who are totally okay with the baby and us having to tend to him.

As I said, our group is very close. We've all spoken and agreed that she's under some wild impression that we're all secretly getting together without her behind her back and excluding her from activities. She's acting delusional. I feel like she just never grew up and never left the mental phase of college. I blasted back at her and I'm awaiting her response.

For the last 5 years or so I have been drinking nespresso vertuo pods. I used the medium intensity pods and each would produce about 230mL of coffee. I would have 1 or 2 cups a day.  
  
I recently got a Jura E4 and I have been using medium roast beans on the ""normal"" setting (2 of 3 beans lit up on the machine). The default setting for coffee dispenses 120mL which is about half (just volume wise) of what I would have with a vertuo pod (230mL). To make up for this, I brew two coffees on my E4 and that fills up one of my coffee mugs.

I was talking to a family member about this and they were surprised at how much coffee I was drinking. They seemed to suggest that because I was brewing 2 coffees to fill up one cup it was twice the intensity of what I was previously drinking with a cup of nespresso. 

I understand there are a lot of variables at play here...but can someone help guide me into how I may figure out what my ""coffee"" intake is and how I can better understand how much I am consuming? I've felt that what I've been drinking for the last many years is a good level and I don't want to stray from it too much with this new machine.

Been on autopilot with the game for a few months but this patch really reinvigorated my enjoyment for the game and I wanted to put my thoughts down.

I was really, *really* pleased with 2.5. Twice in the story where I thought ""this seems like the ending, that was pretty good--"", it *keeps going* and continues to deliver until the very end. No wonder the past few patches had its hiccups with just how *packed* this patch's story and other content was. And experiencing 2.5's story's themes of moving forward and hope, and how it relates to the larger context of the game's own lifespan has really cemented my love for these devs.

It's not just all the numerous new features and QoL additions, but just a really genuine earnestness I can feel from the devs through not just the story, but the entire game experience itself. And I say this as someone jaded by games and Hoyo for many years, with a full but untouched Steam library.

# Specifics

**Final Battle:** 2.5's ""group finale"" feels like a great improvement over 1.4 - 1.4 felt too much like they were trying to rush an ""Avengers Endgame"" style group battle with all the factions involved, only to feel too rushed and abit unearned because most of them were just kinda there last minute. But in 2.5 when they split up the different combat groups, I was hoping we actually get to play as the different teams so I can feel more involved in the grand battle and they actually did! I feel it pulled off the pacing and emotional investment of a finale battle much better than 1.4.

**Yixuan:** I know Yixuan is a lot more divisive than Miyabi in terms of Void Hunter-tiers, but I really feel they did so much more and worked a lot harder to make me like Yixuan - Miyabi is lovable pretty much from the start - she was already hyped, very appealing personality and combat, she was in the Beta so matches everyone's first impression of the ZZZ aesthetic - but IMO over Year 2, Yixuan feels like a lot more of a nuanced and layered character & has a lot more of a relationship with the Proxy which I've grown to appreciate.

I was definitely on the Yixuan skeptic train from the start because of her outfit and ""magic-y"" powers, but the devs really persisted in working twice as hard to make Yixuan likeable and I really warmed up to her, even ended up liking her more than Miyabi. By that point, I was willing to handwave whatever explanations they have for her going missing the same way nobody really questions in comic books why Superman doesn't solve everyone's problems - at some point you just gotta play along and accept there's a tightrope to walk between having her be relevant enough as a big player yet not too omnipresent in the story.

**Waifei Peninsula:** While I'm not the hugest fan of Waifei and the general ""obligatory Chinese region"" gacha trend, I warmed up to it over time after knowing it was more into the ""Hong Kong martial arts movie"" theme than wuxia fantasy, and especially since the game still adds entire new regions like Fantasy Resort and exploration zones, Spook Shack and Krampus in general really endeared me to 2.x and reassured me that the character designs were still going to hit well. Even with more divisive designs like Yidhari and Lucia, I still could enjoy Yidhari's story and Lucia's EP ended up being my absolute favourite so far.

**General:** I do really think the devs took the ""we miss the urban aesthetic"" critiques to heart from a lot of the new features added lately. The customisable Functions menu reminds me of old Walkman-era players and Windows Media Player skins which is awesome. While I still wish Inter-Knot scrolling came back, the player guild Outpost feature definitely scratches that Inter-Knot itch *while* making it suitably meta by having actual players be involved instead of pregenerated NPC posts, which I found to be a satisfyingly creative way to address it.

# Story & Theme

Maybe I'm a sucker for sappy stories, but I really enjoyed this patch's story. I don't even think it made me as emotional as other Hoyo story arcs or was as satisfying as other arcs, but just experiencing it made me really appreciative of the writing. I might just be the super easily impressed kind of reader.

I know it's a common complaint that ""all the characters have a dead relative/were a soldier or experiment"", but one thing I always appreciated in ZZZ is how singularly it unifies its cast to its themes and central event: the Hollow disaster. I feel the importance of the Hollow disaster because nearly no character is completely untouched by it. I picture it like a post-World War II story where every character was alive to have fought in it, or knows someone who did. Many would be ex-military. Many would have lost someone in the war. It'd be odd not to meet someone who wasn't affected.

Yes, some of the backstories are somewhat repetitive in terms of origin, but I always enjoyed how the game explored the specifics of how those characters were affected by loss and how they dealt with it. Just because millions died in a war from bombings or in the trenches, completely identical to each other, doesn't mean each of their stories and the people connected to those lost lives were identical.

I always appreciated that ZZZ didn't just use its post-apocalypse setting as a cool backdrop for action scenes, but actually explored the trauma of a society that nearly survived extinction, yet still thrives and remains vibrant in spite of its suffering. The fact every character has lost someone or something to this world makes the world feel ever-present, and the characters a concrete part of its history.

2.5's story really put that to the forefront, with how much it emphasizes even the littlest things like enjoying the five senses, or the kindness of a chance childhood meeting. So much of it grapples with the ideas of ""is it better to suffer and survive, than to be perpetually safe from harm?"" and ""is life worth living even if one day it all is destroyed or forgotten?"" that I find really compelling and I love how ZZZ always put the emotional core and its characters at the centre of these questions. People often call this type of story ""Hopepunk"" and even if it can be repetitive, I always respect how ZZZ always engages and explores its central themes of hope and moving forward without fail.

I myself do miss the less supernatural, more underground Proxy plotline back when they were still maintaining their secret identities, but the fact their story still maintains the same central thread of the siblings trying to clear their mentor's name and how they're still coping with the effects of her loss and her actions has still kept me invested.

# Optimistic Thoughts

At this point, I've come to accept ZZZ's jank and mishaps in hindsight, whether it's mysterious delays or mismatched voicelines or unfortunate banner timings or the odd underwhelming character design, because 2.5 has really shown me that the ZZZ is a passion project, its devs really, *really* care about their game and are doing their best to figure it out, even if they can't please every single player in existence immediately. It feels less like the typical Hoyo screw I'm used to by now and more like growing pains of a game trying to define its place year by year in a constantly changing landscape.

I feel like complaining about black screen text or an image using posed 3D models instead of being drawn from scratch feel like such tiny, pointless nitpicks at this point, because the sheer amount of content delivered in 2.5 (along with how much of it is aimed towards directly improving on either player experience or iterating on previous shortfalls) really showed me the *hundreds* of plates the ZZZ team has to spin to even make this game worth playing daily, let alone satisfying.

Of course there's still things worthy of critique - this patch still has the obvious ""the new NPC introduced this patch who's kind of an asshole is secretly a villain"" trope, and I'll keep sending feedback about the pointless dialogue choices or other things that deserve critique or are worthy of review.

But I still got a satisfying story and an improved game experience out of it.  The amount of things I enjoyed this patch really put into perspective for me how trivial most (though not all) of my gripes were in the grand scheme of things. If losing a 4th animation in character select meant they cooked something even better in the long run, then fine. I'll still earnestly wish some things stay like more coffee options or better noodle shop, but I'm not gonna lose my head and cry ZZZ has ""lost its way or identity"" over it.

Because at this point the devs have enough of my trust that if they're not fixing it *now*, they're probably workshopping a better option for later. *Maybe* one day ZZZ will be such a cash cow that they won't care anymore, but since that's not the case yet, I'll continue enjoying it and greet the game's future with optimism and a level of trust.

\---

(For some optional, semi-related context, I was a fan of a animated show called RWBY for over 10 years, which had very similar tropes with ZZZ (post-apocalypse anime with a fantasy urban aesthetic and fighting monsters with cool weapons). RWBY had a ton of passion and earnest creativity starting out that ZZZ shares, but it *really* fumbled itself over the years in a way when I, as a longtime fan, could plainly feel its creators *did not* give a shit about critique or improving its story.

I mention this because that experience made me *hyper* aware of when something really has no clue what its identity is and doesn't care as long as fans keep showing up, vs. something that's still growing into itself and actively tries to improve, and I think ZZZ is squarely in the latter.)",3,1767322680.0,ZZZ_Official,1,1.0,False
1q1n6wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PayForResultsSEO/comments/1q1n6wd/stop_chasing_da_why_link_relevance_is_the_real/,Stop Chasing DA: Why Link Relevance is the Real SEO Ranking Factor,"# Stop Chasing DA: Why Link Relevance is the Real SEO Ranking Factor

For years, the SEO industry has been locked in a numbers game. Agencies sell links based on Domain Authority (DA) or Domain Rating (DR), and business owners buy them, convinced that a higher number equals a better ranking. It is a comforting metric—a single, quantifiable score that supposedly tells you how ""powerful"" a website is.

But there is a problem with this approach. You can spend thousands of dollars acquiring high-DA backlinks and see absolutely no movement in your search engine rankings. Worse, you might see a decline.

This happens because you are optimizing for a third-party metric, not for Google. Google’s algorithms have evolved far beyond simple vote-counting. Today, the search engine prioritizes context and intent. A link from a massive news aggregator might look good on a spreadsheet, but if it has nothing to do with your industry, it is effectively noise.

To build a sustainable link building strategy that actually drives traffic and revenue, you need to stop obsessing over power and start prioritizing connection. It is time to understand why link relevance matters more than domain metrics.

# The Domain Authority Myth: Proxies Are Not Ranking Factors

Before we dissect relevance, we have to dismantle the pedestal we’ve put Domain Authority on. Metrics like DA (Moz), DR (Ahrefs), or TF (Majestic) are proprietary scores created by software companies. They are useful comparative tools, but they are not used by Google.

Google has explicitly stated that they do not use Domain Authority as a ranking signal. When you prioritize a link solely because it has a DA of 60+, you are chasing a ghost.

# Why the obsession persists

If Google doesn't use these metrics, why does the industry rely on them? The answer is convenience.

* **Sales:** It is easier to sell a ""DA 50 Link"" for $300 than it is to explain the nuanced value of a niche blog post.
* **Reporting:** It looks impressive to show a client a graph of rising average DA.
* **Laziness:** Analyzing relevance requires human judgment; analyzing DA requires a script.

However, high metrics often mask low quality. A site can inflate its DA through spammy link networks or by publishing thousands of pages of low-quality content to capture stray keywords. A link from such a site, despite its high ""score,"" offers zero value to your SEO performance.

# Understanding Link Relevance in the Age of Semantic Search

Google’s goal is to organize the world's information. To do this, it needs to understand the relationships between entities (things, people, places, and concepts).

When a website links to you, it is essentially voting for your content. But in modern SEO, not all votes are equal. Google analyzes the *thematic relationship* between the linking page and the target page. This is link relevance SEO in action.

If you run a specialized coffee roasting business, a link from a massive, generalist technology blog (even one with high metrics) is confusing. Why is a tech site vouching for coffee beans? The connection is weak.

Conversely, a link from a small, dedicated barista blog with a lower DA is incredibly powerful. It tells Google: ""Experts in the coffee industry trust this roaster."" This reinforces your topical authority and helps Google understand exactly where you fit in the knowledge graph.

# The three layers of relevance

To evaluate backlink relevance effectively, you should look at three distinct layers:

1. **Domain Relevance:** Is the overall theme of the website aligned with yours? (e.g., A fitness site linking to a supplement store).
2. **Page Relevance:** Is the specific article linking to you about a related topic? (e.g., An article about ""Best Post-Workout Recovery"" linking to your protein powder).
3. **Link Relevance:** Does the anchor text and the surrounding text make sense? (e.g., The link appears naturally within a sentence discussing nutrition).

# The David vs. Goliath Scenario: Low Metrics vs. High Relevance

Let’s look at a practical example of why metrics can be misleading and why a relevance-first approach wins.

Imagine you are doing SEO for a boutique agency that sells **accounting software for small businesses**. You have the budget for one high-quality link placement.

**Option A: The High-Metric Generalist**

* **Site:** A generic ""Lifestyle and News"" portal.
* **Metrics:** DA 75, Traffic 500k/month.
* **Content:** The link is placed in an article titled ""10 Tips for a Better Work-Life Balance.""
* **Context:** The mention is vague: ""Use tools to save time, like this accounting software.""

**Option B: The Low-Metric Specialist**

* **Site:** A niche blog dedicated to ""Fintech for Startups.""
* **Metrics:** DA 25, Traffic 5k/month.
* **Content:** The link is placed in a deep-dive review titled ""The Best Accounting Tools for Bootstrapped Startups in 2024.""
* **Context:** The link is a specific recommendation for your software's invoicing feature.

# The Winner? Option B.

Despite Option A having ""better"" metrics, Option B is the superior link for several reasons:

1. **Audience Alignment:** The readers of the Fintech blog are actually looking for accounting software. The readers of the lifestyle blog are not. Option B will drive *referral traffic* that actually converts.
2. **Semantic Signal:** Google associates the Fintech blog with terms like ""finance,"" ""SaaS,"" and ""invoicing."" A link from there transfers that topical relevance to your site.
3. **Sustainability:** Option A looks like a paid placement (a ""guest post farm""). Option B looks like a genuine editorial citation.

By choosing Option B, you are building quality backlinks that contribute to your site’s expertise, rather than just inflating a vanity metric.

# Contextual Backlinks: It’s Not Just Who, But Where

Relevance isn't just about the domain; it is about the placement. This is where the concept of **contextual backlinks** becomes vital.

A link buried in the footer or the sidebar is generally ignored by search engines. These are often site-wide links that offer little semantic value. Similarly, a link in an ""Author Bio"" box is clearly self-promotional and carries less weight.

The gold standard is a link embedded within the main body content of a relevant paragraph. Google uses natural language processing (NLP) to read the words *surrounding* your link.

If the text around your link discusses ""tax automation,"" ""IRS compliance,"" and ""financial reporting,"" and then links to your accounting software, those surrounding keywords act as clues. They tell Google exactly what your page is about. This context amplifies the power of the link, regardless of the Domain Authority of the host site.

# Risk Reduction: Relevance as a Shield

There is another massive advantage to prioritizing relevance over metrics: security.

Google’s spam filters (like Penguin and subsequent ""SpamBrain"" updates) are constantly hunting for manipulative link patterns. One of the easiest patterns for AI to spot is a lack of relevance. When a gambling site links to a bakery, or a fashion blog links to an industrial roof repair company, it raises an immediate red flag. These connections do not happen in nature. They only happen when money changes hands.

By focusing on link relevance SEO, you are naturally insulating your website from penalties. When you secure links from industry-adjacent sites, you are mimicking natural growth.

* It makes sense for a wedding photographer to link to a florist.
* It makes sense for a software developer to link to a web host.
* It makes sense for a mechanic to link to an auto parts manufacturer.

These links are defensible. If a manual reviewer from Google were to look at your backlink profile, they would see a logical ecosystem of professional connections, not a random assortment of high-DA unrelated domains.

# How to Pivot Your Link Building Strategy

Moving away from the comfort of DA scores requires a shift in mindset. You need to start evaluating opportunities based on topical alignment. Here is how to refine your link building strategy to focus on quality backlinks:

# 1. Analyze the ""Neighborhood""

Before pursuing a link, look at who else the site links to. Do they link to reputable sites in your niche? Or do they link to essay writing services, casinos, and crypto schemes? A site with a ""bad neighborhood"" is toxic, regardless of its DA.

# 2. Check for Topical Authority

Does the site have a clear focus? A site that covers tech, health, travel, finance, and pets is usually a ""content farm"" designed to sell links. A site that covers *only* sustainable travel is an authority. Aim for the specialists.

# 3. Prioritize Traffic Over Metrics

If you must look at a metric, look at organic traffic (using tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs). If a site has a DA of 60 but zero organic traffic from Google, it means Google has penalized or ignored that site. A link from a site Google ignores is worthless. A site with legitimate traffic—even if the DA is low—is a site Google trusts.

# 4. The ""Referral Test""

Ask yourself: ""If Google didn't exist, would I still want this link?""  
If the answer is yes because it would bring potential customers to your site, then it is a highly relevant link. If the answer is no, you are likely just chasing metrics.

# Relevance is the Future of Authority

We are moving toward a web where authority is not a singular score, but a relative concept. You can be an authority on ""vegan leather boots"" without being an authority on ""leather care"" generally. Google wants to rank the most relevant expert for the specific query.

When you prioritize relevance, you are feeding Google exactly what it wants: clear signals about who you are, what you do, and who trusts you.

High DA links are expensive, risky, and often ineffective. Relevant links are authentic, defensible, and drive real growth. Stop worrying about the metrics on a third-party toolbar and start building a network of meaningful connections within your industry. That is how you win in modern SEO.

# FAQ: Link Relevance and Metrics

# Is Domain Authority important for SEO?

Domain Authority (DA) itself is not a Google ranking factor. It is a metric developed by Moz to predict how well a website will rank. While it correlates with ranking potential, improving your DA score does not directly improve your Google rankings. You should view it as a comparative benchmark, not a KPI.

# Are low-DA backlinks worth anything?

Yes, absolutely. A backlink from a low-DA site can be incredibly valuable if it is highly relevant to your niche. If the linking site has real traffic and is topically aligned with your content, it passes ""topical authority"" to your site. Often, a DA 20 link from a strict competitor or niche partner is worth more than a DA 60 link from a generic news site.

# How do I evaluate backlink relevance?

To evaluate relevance, look at the content surrounding the link. Does the article topic match your page's topic? Does the website's general audience overlap with your target audience? If the transition from their site to yours feels natural and helpful to a reader, the link is likely relevant.

# Can irrelevant links hurt SEO?

Yes. A large volume of irrelevant links can signal to Google that you are engaging in manipulative link building schemes. This can lead to algorithmic devaluation (where the links are simply ignored) or, in severe cases, manual penalties that remove your site from search results. It confuses Google regarding what your site is actually about.

I would like to brew a couple of cups of coffee in the morning, about 20oz total and have 2 10 oz cups.  Is there a good way to keep the pot warm with out altering the taste to much?

I have personally always used Hario filters and manipulated agitation to control draw down time and avoid clogs.

For context, my baseline recipe for dialing in is 16g beans, 250g water, 205F water, grind size on the medium-coarse end for pourover. I always start by trying a 50g bloom for 30-45 seconds then slowly pour in the remaining water in a single pour, usually giving about a 2:10-2:50 total draw down depending on the coffee.

From here under extraction is an easy fix: just increase the amount of separate pours, pour more aggressively, or add some swirling to increase agitation and slow down the draw.

If it is over extracted and bitter then I pull out my ""ligma spoon"" and pour the water onto the spoon close to the water surface or even slightly under it to break the waters fall, causing the least amount of agitation possible. Doing this I can reduce the draw time of my second (first excluding bloom) pour (200g) down to 45 seconds if I want. If this is to fast then I can add as much agitation as needed by swirling or stirring.

**So by controlling agitation like this and leaving all other parameters alone I can reliably make total brew time range from 1:15 to 4:00+ minutes**, including a 30 second bloom in each time. If clogging can be prevented by manipulating agitation then what benefit do more expensive filters provide?",3,1767322118.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

1q1my5y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1my5y,"Week 1: New Year, New Recipe - Chiffon Cake with Tea Infused Whipped Cream","Happy New Year 🎊  I baked this plain chiffon cake (with apple tea, plum barley tea, and cinnamon puer infused whipped creams to pair) on the 31st and tasted it just after midnight, so truly a new year‘s new recipe 🎆

This is my first cake in over ten years! I first tried to bake one in… 2011, I believe? Just a plain yellow cake, but wasn’t patient enough to let it cool for the multiple hours it needed, so it stuck to the pan and I made trifle instead. Told myself that cakes weren’t for me, apparently!

Recently I was thinking about my time in Japan and these little chiffon cakes I’d get from the mall by the train station. After a rabbit hole of research, it seems the company doesn’t exist anymore. Their chiffon cake was so light but still had a nice chew, and they paired them with fresh whipped cream that sometimes had flavor infused into it. The best was the black tea flavor, I think about it all the time!

I finally decided that if I’d never get those cakes again, I may as well finally try and make my own, using my vast collection of Japanese teas. I was despairing over what pan to buy when one basically fell into my lap at an antique store, so for New Years, I swallowed my cake fears and tried it out, using this recipe: [https://int.japanesetaste.com/blogs/japanese-taste-recipes/how-to-make-a-light-fluffy-chiffon-cake-japanese-style-chiffon-cake-recipe](https://int.japanesetaste.com/blogs/japanese-taste-recipes/how-to-make-a-light-fluffy-chiffon-cake-japanese-style-chiffon-cake-recipe)

I was a bit afraid of leaving it in too long and drying it out, but when I took it out I thought the top looked a bit pale and I do believe it is slightly underdone along the top and center (just looks a bit more dense). But!! I let it cool for many hours before successfully releasing it and I’m extremely happy it turned out as well as it did! Getting over my cake traumas finally. I also wonder if I should’ve tried to get more of the larger air bubbles out before baking? I was afraid of knocking too much air out of the meringue though, I do live in a very humid place so I wanted to be very gentle with it. I’ve never made a meringue before and had a moment of despair before it finally came together.

The whipped creams were their own battle - I should’ve made more of each flavor, I think the tiny batches I did worked against me, and one of them I accidentally turned into a (very delicious) butter, but the tea infusions tasted very good! The apple black tea is probably my favorite, the cinnamon puer is a close second (but its the one that turned to butter…), and the plum barley ended up tasting actually rather like coffee (in a good way!). I’ll definitely experiment more with these and I’m sure the cream infusion process will get easier.

I hope everyone’s enjoying their new bakes 🫶",4,1767321979.0,52weeksofbaking,0,1.0,False

* Describe a time you felt a strong sense of belonging in a group. What was happening, and what made you feel that way?
* How have gender stereotypes impacted the way you move through the world? Are there any ways you challenge gender stereotypes in your day to day life?
* How do your intersecting identities (eg: race, gender, ability, sexuality, etc.) influence your world view? 
* What assumptions do people often make about you/your personality and how accurate or inaccurate are they?

Note, not everyone’s side effects may be the same. I started 150 mg 12/1.

First week: The first day I took it at 7:30am as advised and had intense anxiety at work that lasted until 5pm. I only drank half a cup of coffee and dumped the rest I was so jittery. I decided to cut off coffee to prevent it from happening again.

Day 2-5: I was nervous every morning taking it, but determined that I’m taking the right steps to fight my depression and give this a real shot. Took it and still had some anxiety, but not as intense as the first day. I also started to have very weird vivid dreams that felt real as if I was never fully asleep. These dreams would wake me up around 4am and unable to go back to sleep. I felt exhausted, but when I took the pill at 7am would have a ton of energy and be productive at work despite only 4-5 hours of sleep. 

Day 6-7: anxiety began to settle, I attributed it to me cutting out all coffee/caffeine etc. I also noticed that I had higher executive functioning at work and felt more calm. I had more control of my thoughts and rumination time was slowing down. I could pull myself out quicker vs spiraling for hours. I also noticed that I didn’t have the desire to drink wine after work anymore or to turn for it when stressful events happened.

Day 8-12: anxiety spiked slightly, but not as bad as those first 3 days. My partner said I was far more productive and I did feel more motivated to cook when I got home from work vs doom scroll on the couch. Could have been placebo, but I was starting to feel more like myself for the first time in years in terms of productivity and no longer numb. The lack of sleep did continue along with vivid dreams, but I also got another weird side effect - night sweats. I was sweating like I never have before and would wake up from nightmares drenched in sweat. Ladies, my breasts were also super sore for a few days. I wasn’t sure if this was related but searched this sub and some people have experienced this. 

Day 12-15: The vivid dreams continued and night sweats. Anxiety way down, almost none except situational anxiety (presenting at work). The vivid dreams and night sweats continued. I was now feeling exhausted on the 4-5 hours of sleep nightly and taking the pill in the morning no longer gave me that stimulant feeling. I had an appointment with my doctor on the 15th and she prescribed be Seroquel. 

Day 15-20: Night sweats stopped, not sure if it was due to the seroquel and no longer having dreams where I still felt awake OR my body was now getting more used to the bupropion. Anxiety completely gone, rumination controllable, no more doom scrolling on the couch for hours and I felt social again! Started to call and check on my friends and family more, my social battery had been down all year where this was previously touch for me. I also was recently promoted and now have a team, it helped me be more present and show up for them more.
I did feel more irritable than normal and had a short fuse, especially for drivers or people doing dumb things at the grocery store or work. 

Day 20-25: I felt in control of my thoughts and emotions for the first time in years. The numbness was finally fading. Seroquel makes me too groggy though and it’s super tough to get up in the morning. Luckily I was off work for the holidays so could sleep in later. I started splitting and taking half, but still quite groggy in the morning. I’ve never had so much trouble getting up. I go back to work soon - not sure if I’ll continue taking it. I may ask the doctor for something else as a sleep aid. I started coffee again, but half decaf to get me going in the morning. Tried full caffeine on day 25, it’s no longer impacting me like it did in the beginning? I also no longer have the stimulant effect in the mornings, maybe my honeymoon period is over. I miss it already and get what everyone was talking about on this sub now. 

Day 25-30: irritability is finally fading, it’s been a life changing experience for me and I am hoping it continues to help me over the next few months. Majority of negative side effects are gone, I just need to figure out the sleeping part. My dog had to have emergency surgery and I would have normally spiraled, but I was calm and felt in control. My social battery is still way up, executive function up at work, I also read 4 books this month. I asked my partner what he has noticed and he said 1. I’m no longer on the couch for hours sad 2. I’m more in control of my anxiety when we leave the house 3. I seem happier and finally present . For me personally, it’s been life changing because I no longer numb and feel life again vs going through the motions. I am noticing the small things that make life beautiful again. I’m not putting myself down or tough on myself when I make mistakes and give myself grace. I hope this continues, happy to report back of anyone is interested. This is my month one reflection, also if anyone has tips on sleep - I’ll take them!

Had no idea how I was going to haul it off so I called some junk removal guy. Then I didn’t want to waste the trip and started the Great Unfuckening. I got a trash bag of clutter out of my dresser, one from underneath my kitchen sink, and one from my linen closet. Full bags! I moved a skinny table from my dining room into the living room, and realized it was so cramped in there! I took all the extra furniture from my spare room (my kitty likes to get away from my dog and so he kind of hangs out in there most of the time and it turned into a cat hair maze) and donated some of it and took what I wanted to save out to my storage shed. Since the room was so empty I gave it a good clean, got him an extra litter box because I thought it would be nice for him to have more options, and moved an extra loveseat out of the living room into there and now he has an “apartment” to hang out in with all his cat things. I even found a small air purifier that I wasn’t using and gave that to him. 

Moving the love seat opened up the living room a ton! I feel so much less claustrophobic. Yesterday I did dishes and laundry all day, got them all put away. I deep cleaned the bathroom and tossed a bag full of empties. I have three large bulk size trash bags of clutter/garbage sitting out on my porch that I believe contains the very last bit of stuff that needed to go. This is the last messy room! I’m going to set a timer and see if I can do a final push to finish! The living room is a struggle for me for some reason, it’s not as bad as the kitchen but since my entryway is there everything gets “dumped” so to speak, and the dog hangs out there a lot and gets things all hairy.

- Put the blue bag in my car for shopping
Straighten the couch covers and pillows 
- pick up the dog puzzle

- Put the big box in my car because it needs to go to work with me
- take the water and flower seeds out to the shed
- find homes for things on the coffee table (mostly photos) 
- dust the trinket shelves on the back wall

It’s early-stage and currently operates on a made-to-order basis — no inventory yet.

My main operational challenge right now is shipping:
- Couriers require final weight and box dimensions to quote accurately.
- My supplier only confirms those after production.
- This makes pricing, margins, and customer quotes difficult to lock down.

On top of that, I have a non-sales-oriented profile. I’m introverted and struggle with traditional outbound selling or direct customer approaches. This affects:
- How I acquire customers
- How aggressively I can push sales
- Which growth strategies are realistically sustainable for me

Because of this, I’m considering whether it makes sense to:
- Invest in an industrial grinder and handle grinding + packaging in-house to standardize weights and shipping, or
- Stay made-to-order longer and focus on systems or channels that reduce the need for direct selling.

Sales are modest, margins are thin, and I can invest — but I want to avoid premature scaling or investing in the wrong bottleneck.

Looking for practical guidance:
- How did you handle shipping before having inventory?
- When did you know it was time to bring packaging in-house?
- Are there sales or growth strategies that work better for founders who aren’t strong at direct selling?",1,1767321311.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False

I was in the nutcracker three times. I was on my way to going into company, and that's only an opportunity if you have not just talent, but passion, and desire. One role I got in the Nutcracker, was the dolls that popped out of the box to give the children toys, and went back in, and were rolled away. If you got that role, you were guaranteed going into company. I didn't even find out that parents were mad at me, an eight year old child, for getting that role until I was 20. 

I know about the CHOP protocol. I don't react well to most of the things it involves.

I’ve had my JM Silver Sky SE for about half a year now and absolutely love how it plays. That said, something’s always felt just a little off visually and I finally figured out what it is.

After lining it up next to my friend’s early-2000s Fender Strat, I realized that all the white plastics on the SE (pickguard, pickup covers, knobs, switch tip, etc.) look a bit too clean and bright. Almost toylike in comparison. The guitar itself feels great, but the plastic just doesn’t have that warm, broken in look.

I’ve done a fair bit of research on aging plastic, and I know different plastics react very differently depending on material and method. Some yellow quickly, others barely change at all. I’ve seen everything from coffee and turmeric to UV exposure and dye baths, but there’s a lot of conflicting info out there.

So I wanted to ask people who’ve actually done this themselves:

1) Have any of you aged the plastic on a PRS SE specifically?

2) What methods worked well for you?

3) Any tips on getting a subtle, vintage cream look rather than something overly yellow or fake?

4) Anything I should absolutely avoid so I don’t ruin the parts?

I know it’s a small cosmetic thing, but I really want to get it right and not regret it. Any firsthand experience or advice would be hugely appreciated.

1q1mbhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1q1mbhd/very_shook_by_situation_at_parish_trigger_warning/,Very shook by situation at parish. (Trigger warning),"Some background, I'm a young male convert who's been going to a parish for a couple years. 

A few months ago another man in his late 20's started visiting our parish, I noticed that he was spending a lot of time with the young girls at our church during coffee hour and later find out from him that he was kicked out of his last parish for sleeping with an under 18 girl, but no legal action was taken as the legal age of consent was 16 in this Jurisdiction (in our area it's 18).

My priest was already aware of this from talking with his last priest and would ""keep an eye on it"", however no one at our parish was notified that we basically had a sex offender in our house (who is also, a very charming, charismatic guy)

I reported him to the priest for attempting to make plans with a girl who had just turned 18, this caused a series of events that ended up with me, my godfather and the would-be predator to have a sitdown, where he explained that he wasn't interested in any of the women at our parish, but that he was actively searching for a wife outside of it, this is when I found out from him that he'd victimized a girl.

I was encouraged by people in the know to be charitable and not to judge, which is very difficult for me as I've been sexually abused (I have to take PTSD meds everyday) in the past and feel extremely uncomfortable around the man, as well as things he would say like complaining about the priest not letting him date girls under 25, or acting like he was an innocent victim of persecution who was slandered at his last parish by his ""ex"", or making excuses that what he did was no big deal as the girl wasn't in high school and was ""mature for her age"". 

I got the feeling that he was actively trying to ingratiate himself to me (which was later confirmed when a friend told me that he asked her how to get me to like him).

One day I see him hugging my friend and I yell at him to stay away from her and call him a rapist in front of everyone, which caused my godfather and some other men to drag me outside and yell at me, what struck me isn't that they were angry at me, but rather that they couldn't care less about what this man had done in the past.

I ended up driving home and haven't been back to church since other than to report the guy (and some other things) to the man in charge of youth protection (who was completely unaware of all this)

When talking to my priest through text and on the phone I've been shocked by how he's treating the whole situation, saying to me ""It's not rape because it wasn't illegal there"" ""How would you feel if someone judged you based on one thing from your past?"" ""Everyone is welcome here"" ""Revenge isn't the answer"" ""People often say things after a breakup"" ""I've seen you talking to minors during coffee hour too"" I've even been accused of jealousy by some.

People were also angry that I told a 12 year old girl to be careful as not all the men at our church were good people, my priest accused me of ""traumatizing"" her when he was the one who allowed a predator in the church in the first place.

This isn't even the first time there's been questionable stuff, there was another man about 28 years old who would drive a high school girl to church in his sports car and hang out with her alone a lot outside church (my priest put a stop to this), as well as a 40 year old guy who would make gross comments about the 15-20 year olds.

She has been waking up to eat like normal, does not seem lethargic at all, has had a couple normal coos, all around I have not noticed any abnormal behavior but we felt like we maybe saw some labored breathing. I took her rectal temp which came back as 100.7, and then took her twin sisters which came back at 97.8. So I sent my husband to the emergency room with her and they said she has no fever and that her temp was 97.9 and that her oxygen was just fine and that she was totally fine, they told my husband she actually looked great. 

She has reflux and torticollis. Which they said the muscle strain can cause the raspyness. She also has thrush which I have read can cause raspyness as well. She does cry a lot sometimes, we are seeing the chiro to try to help her tort and reflux and overall tension. They tested for flu and RSV, both came back negative and they just said to monitor her and if the fever comes back we can give her Tylenol and to bring her back in if it stays past 100 degrees with Tylenol for 48 hours. I’m waiting for pediatrician to call me back tomorrow since they were closed for the holiday.

I keep my toddler home at all times because I would rather her be bored than sick.

I love the place and love it even more now that we are moved in and getting settled. My wife, on the other hand, is very negative about the space. She is obsessed with small imperfections such as a couple scuffed floor boards and some small damage on the walls etc. no big deal right? Typical marital nonsense and not a serious issue, right? Well for whatever reason every time she complains about the apartment it sends me into a tailspin where I instantly have to leave, have to be away from her immediately, just walking the streets for hours in the freezing cold muttering to myself and…this is embarrassing…but CRYING in public. Today she started going on about some things she doesn’t like about the bathroom and I had to leave and ended up crying at a coffee shop and having to leave the shop all embarrassed. I have no history of mental illness, meds, depression, even anxiety. So why did I end up standing outside a Brooklyn psychiatric intake facility for an hour on New Years Day because my wife complained about a bathroom paint job? Why did I run when I thought someone at the front desk saw me? Why did it fill me with such joy the day last week she told me she liked the new space and is sorry she doubted me? And why did her seeming reversal on this make me feel like I needed to check in to a facility after I sobbed in a coffee shop? Why am I sort of hoping this woman I love just leaves forever and I never have to hear her complain about a damn floorboard ever again? Why do complaints about this apartment drive me to this point? Do I perhaps feel like a fraud? Someone who tries so hard to make her happy and keep a nice roof over our heads and was hoping this would be it and since it isn’t im now convinced she will never be happy ever? Am I scared to have to move out of the city where I know I will be miserable?

I am gearing up to leave LA soon, but I kept the app active in the off chance, that I do in fact meet someone I like. I do put in the apps about me section that I am leaving LA this month so people are aware. 

I matched with a 5'3"" white lady who was infatuated with Indian  culture after some trip she had there last year which was apparently something for her ""spirit"". She did a backpacking solo trip across India and some other SE Asia countries over the span of a couple months. Conversation was actually really smooth on the app and it was meaningful, and we arranged to meet New Years Eve for a coffee before she went downtown with her friends. 

I got to the café first and she came in 5 minutes after ( this is important later ). Conversation was good, no height comments, just a lot of travel talk, career stuff, and I was comfortable and so was she. She even brought up that she was specifically interested in Indian men because of her interest in the way of life and culture. We even got a little silly and poked fun at each other a bit and the date was going well.

After an hour or so, we both agreed to meet again before i leave and got up to leave. This is when she made a joke about me being a clown, because my shoes were big despite my height (5'5"", size 11.5 US but I wear 12 US for comfort). Nothing was said about my height until now, and I brushed it off and laughed. But on the way out, she just couldn't let it go. I tried to change the subject to walking out but she just kept bringing it up. We said bye with her still  chuckling a bit and needless to say, that 2nd date isn't happening. By the time I got home, I noticed I was already unmatched with on the app and i didn't ask for any of her socials.

I’ve been on a real bender all through December and I’ve been counting down the days til freedom. I’ve been having my wine funeral. Just having as much as I want, as much as I can to “get it out of my system”. 

I drank a lot of wine last night while cooking New Year’s Eve dinner for my family. I ate too much, drank too much, and was barely hanging on by the time the last guest left around 9:30. I wanted so badly to make it to midnight. I wanted my last drink—my final glass of champagne at midnight. Instead, I was passed out in bed by 10.
This morning I woke up to an open bottle of champagne in the fridge, missing about one modest glass. I made huevos rancheros for breakfast. Man, mimosas would’ve been perfect—but I white-knuckled it. I tried everything to distract myself. I hydrated. I drank coffee. I made Sleepytime tea with honey. I watched my show. I tried so hard to forget that bottle of champagne and the fact that it was New Year’s Day and I should be able to have some.
In the end, it was the beef bourguignon that got me. I made it for dinner last night and had so much left. But I’d read on this sub that 85% of the alcohol remains… so how could I start Dry January while eating wine soup? Might as well start tomorrow, right? And if I was going to eat the stew, I might as well finish the champagne too… obviously.
One bottle of champagne and most of a bottle of Bordeaux later, it looks like Dry January starts on January 2nd.
For what it’s worth, I did the same thing last year. Dry January started on January 2nd and turned into Dry February. I relapsed after that. Got sober again in September. Relapsed again in October.
My goal this year is a dry 2026. One day does not matter. January 2nd is just as magical as January 1st. I can do this. You can do this. It’s not all contingent on January 1st—it’s about consistency, and never stopping trying.

Huge relevant part of the story is that (a) we were highschool sweethearts and (b) we’ve been broken up for almost 7 years now. 

We were each other’s first everything, and he was the one who ended it. Well actually he acted terribly until I broke it off, and then denied getting back together when I asked the next day lol. Anyway, at 18 I really thought we’d be together forever. We had just finished our first semester of undergrad together and I was feeling very “adult.” Funny enough, that breakup is what I view as the start of me maturing because it was the first time life threw me a curveball that I had to come back from. Our dorms were right across from one another, and all these years later I still remember how heartbroken and down I felt. 

My ex actually reached out to reconcile a year later. Thankfully, at this point, I wad going through my second breakup lmao. But even that joke of a relationship showed me that more is out there and I wasn’t as happy with my ex as I thought. After saying he’d be open to being friends, he stopped talking to me when I got into another relationship and did the same after a short reconciliation in Jan 2024 lol.

Fast forward to Dec 2025, and he reached out again. I had such a great time catching up over coffee and, after confirming he’s down to be friends and won’t block me, invited me to his family’s NYE party. 

It felt so nice to see everyone after 7 years and truly know deep down that everything really does get better. The version of me who was crying in her bed over him at 18 would never believe I brought in the year with him at 25. and as friends!!

I am 31M Civil Engineer recently got laid off from my job in Orlando, FL (Maitland to be exact). The place where I live is called Altamonte Springs, FL, a very small quiet town, but not very far from Orlando downtown or Winter Park, FL which is also a very safe and nice neighborhood. I was doing really well here with my $70K salary, paying $1300/month rent and almost $250 for bills. I had my one bedroom huge apartment (750 sq. ft with a huge bathroom which is maybe as big as a small bedroom lol, and a huge patio). I was able to save a bit of money, even though it was not much, but it was something, and I am used to eating outside occasionally, having nice lattes, going out on the weekends which costs a lot of money in Orlando with uber fares and drinks, etc. 

Now my company laid me off all of a sudden before the holidays, which is more problematic to me because I am on a STEM OPT visa and I need to find a job in less than 60 days. Recently, one of my acquaintances told me about a job in NYC, it is ready to join immediately. The owner offered me $75k/year. My question is, how living in NYC with that amount of money compare with my way of living in Altamonte Springs, FL where they don't even have state income tax? I know, with living costs in NYC, it is very low salary. But I don't want to share apartments as I have very bad experiences and bad luck with roommates (last apartment I shared, other roommates tried to physically assault my friend whom I let to stay in my room for a few days when I was not staying in the room myself). If I even stay in New Jersey, what kind of adjustments I have to do?

​EXT. NEW YORK CITY - TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (DECEMBER 31, 1999)
​Rain slicks the pavement. It is neon, loud, and chaotic. The eve of the millennium.
​People in ""2000"" glasses scream excitedly. A massive BILLBOARD flashes news footage: “Y2K PANIC: WILL THE GRID HOLD?”
​We pan down to a grime-covered phone booth. Standing next to it, sheltering from the rain, is MIKE WHEELER (28).
​He looks tired. He wears a long wool coat, his hair unkempt. He holds a cigarette he hasn’t lit. He looks nothing like the optimistic leader he once was. He looks haunted.
​INT. MIKE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT (CONT)
​Mike enters his small, cluttered apartment. It’s filled with towers of books and a bulky beige computer monitor that hums loudly.
​He tosses his keys in a bowl. He walks to the answering machine. The red light blinks.

​Mike sighs. He sits at his desk. The computer screen saver is flying through a starfield (the classic Windows maze).
​He touches the mouse. The screen wakes up. A Word document is open. It’s blank.
​Suddenly, the lights in the apartment FLICKER.
​Mike freezes. He knows that flicker. It’s not a power surge. It’s a pulse.

​The computer monitor distorts. The image stretches.

(Whispering)
No. Not here.
​He backs away. The lights surge brighter, burning white-hot. The hum of the computer monitor rises to a deafening SCREECH.
​Then, silence. The apartment goes black.
​In the darkness, the computer monitor glows a faint, sickly RED.
​Text appears on the DOS prompt, typing itself.
​... M I K E ...

​DUSTIN HENDERSON (28) rolls in a chair. He’s wearing a vest with too many pockets and a headset. He looks healthier than Mike, but intense. Driven.
​He is staring at a wall of monitors displaying wave frequencies.
​A coworker, STEVE (not Harrington, just a generic tech guy named Steve), walks by with coffee.
​TECH STEVE
Yo, Henderson. Give it a rest. The world’s gonna end in twelve hours. Come to the mixer.
​DUSTIN
The world isn't going to end because of a coding error, Steve. It’s going to end because nobody is listening to the silence between the code.

​Mike lowers the gun. He knows that voice. He opens the door.
​LUCAS SINCLAIR (28) stands there. He’s wearing a suit, an NYPD detective badge on his belt. He looks hardened, strong, and angry.
​LUCAS
You want to tell me why I just got a call from Dustin saying the world is ending, and it’s starting in your living room?
​MIKE
I didn't call him.
​LUCAS
Then who did?
​Mike steps aside, gesturing to the computer. It’s still glowing red. The text has changed.
​... H E ... I S ... H E R E ...
​Lucas stares at the screen. The cynicism drains from his face, replaced by the terror of a child who fought monsters.
​LUCAS
I thought we killed it. We burned it all.

​JOYCE
Quiet is good.
​Suddenly, the phone on the wall rings.
​They both stare at it. It rings again. Loud. Harsh.
​Hopper looks at Joyce. The peace in the room evaporates instantly.

I swear to God the Portlandia Series writers  must have visited the store and thought, ""Wow, here's some material that writes itself. You can't make this shit up."" It was a lot like the Woman's Bookstore skits. The Serious Juggling owners  didn't want to sell you jack shit. They even setup the store so that you couldn't get passed the entry way by the door when you walked in. The place was a hoot and the owners were absolutely nuts!

So, grab a cup of coffee or a beer, and sit back and relax while you peruse the historical documents of the store through the eyes of the people who were there to be abused (myself included).  Ladies and gentleman, I present to you... their Yelp reviews. Be sure and check the one star reviews, they're easy to find. Have fun!

NFC/RFID-enabled smart rings are an early but massively promising category -- think seamless access, payments, identity, and beyond!💍🚀

With the right execution (focusing on real-world constraints like battery life, form factor, security, and novel use cases), this feels like it has true billion-dollar potential, similar to how Jamie Siminoff turned a simple doorbell into Ring.

The space is still wide open: tons of untapped applications in productivity, security, biohacking, and everyday automation. I'm exploring a venture-scale build here and would love a technical cofounder with hands-on experience in embedded systems, NFC/RFID integration, wearables hardware, or IoT prototyping. 🛠️

If you're a hardware engineer, hacker, or embedded dev who's excited about pushing the limits of what's possible in a tiny ring form factor, let's grab a short virtual coffee chat.☕

Happy to dive into tech constraints (e.g., passive vs active NFC, antenna design, power management), brainstorm use cases, or share my initial thinking.

I'm an owner of an e-trike and I've been using it to commute to my job from the Kenneth park area to west Hollywood area.

This was the first time in almost 30 years I owned a bike (trike) and I've been the happiest ever since then. The thing is, I DO want to use it to go do errands, like go to the supermarket, or get a coffee and such, but I'm terrified of leaving it outside and getting my trike stolen.

For more context, I got my trike through the metro bike incentive program. I was in the first wave, and I felt extremely lucky when I got in. My bike was free all in all. I've been adding lights and add-ons from my own pocket of course, but that's why I have such deep attachments to it.

Because of this fear (and also I do have issues with high anxiety and I'm an introvert) I've only used my bike to commute and nothing else, even when I'm itching so bad just to go explore and experience the liberty to go to places and be able to get to know LA as a biker now that I have the opportunity.  
  
My questions are:   

1. I do not have a car and I'm not US native; If I wanted to go to a mall and there was parking, are there specific spots for bikes that I can use, and pay? Are these spots decently secure?  
2. How much time do you guys leave your bikes (or trikes) when you go to the supermarket? Do you prefer to do a pick-up order and do it as fast as possible or you actually can spend time inside the store? 
3. I've seen some parks, like the Kenneth park, have some trails that some bikers use, but being completely honest, I've never been to the park (or any park), and even checking google maps, idk if a trike would fit the trail. Have any of you visited trails that are totally not trike advised that I should know?
4. Triking at night: this is no brainer for some... but I do pass through an intersection in la Cienega where cars have literally tried to run me over... during summer! so, I just want to ask if it's ok to take the sidewalk for like 3 minutes until I reach a slower neighborhood? or I'm doomed to die? :(

Some questions might sound ridiculous I know... I literally just go from home to my job and vice versa. This bike is my door to some free will, I guess? And I want to do so responsibly and without losing it while at it.

I'll be in Auckland (visiting from Canada (Montréal)) until Monday. I am staying at a hotel near the airport (I'm being intentionally vague here) and the staff recommended I go to Viaduct Harbour for sightseeing. I think I'll spend all day there tomorrow and Sunday (weather permitting).   


What I'd like from you, if you don't mind, is food recommendations. From fine dining to your favourite hole in the wall, where should I eat? I have a small appetite so I want quality over quantity (AYCE type places are wasted on me).  


I like:
- breakfast places (eggs Benny, waffles, breakfast sandwiches, etc)  
- burgers, steak, meat of most sorts    
- fish (but not seafood or sushi)  
- vegetarian/vegan places  
- cider, wine, cocktails (not beer)  
- coffee (espresso drinks, not Starbucks/Dunkin/Tim Hortons)  
- unique experiences *without* it being a gimmicky tourist trap   

I'm traveling solo, so bonus points for places where I can chill with a book without being worried I'm occupying a table for too long.

My most modest goal was to make it from 9 exams left to 6, and I managed just that, all while having started to work as well as study in the second half of the year.

Reduce phone use: Failed. I've gotten slightly worse. Now not only I waste time, I also have the self sabotaging tendency to engage in rage bait, and getting pissed off during arguments with strangers on Reddit. 

Pursue a bit more romance: Done. I'm still single but I've started to look for dates again. I finished the year with one possible romantic prospect with a girl in college and another (less likely though) with a girl in the gym. I also think a girl friend of a girl friend likes me, and I definitely like her. Maybe I'll actually have a girlfriend by this year. 

Advance in my book: Done. I finished the year getting quite close to the climax of my book (It's around 2/3 complete by now) and despite some occasional writer's block and some forced pauses due to exams and work, I've managed to keep advancing and staying dedicated to finish my creation. 

More variety in my cooking: Failed. I'm pretty much in the same situation as last year. 

Increase frequency and consistency in the gym: Heh, kinda. I've increased the frequency of attending gym (I went from sometimes once sometimes twice a week, to almost always twice a week) and it has shown results (I'm bulkier and more muscular), but not to the point I pictured (thrice a week). I also suffered an injury in my foot during this year (I'm still not sure if caused by the gym or not) that prevented me from exercising my legs for some time. 

Restart therapy: Done. It took time and some insistence from my mother, but I started therapy again in the latter half of the year and it has served me quite a lot. 

Return to my species' monke roots and start walking long distances as a habit: Heh, kinda. I've done quite a share of walking (it helps that I don't have a car or a bike), but it hasn't really become a habit, just a common means to get places. 

Reduce if not completely eliminate porn use: Heh, kinda. I don't use as much porn anymore, but I still use it, and I masturbate just as much as last year.

[North America],"So I've stayed at probably 15 AirBnBs in 2025, all in the Pacific NW area of the US and Canada.  All stays have been over 1 week.  My goal has been to find a community where I'd like to purchase a 2nd home, so I've been staying in AirBnBs to get a good feel for the area and different villages/towns.  I'm not staying in discount places, these are all higher end properties. I've noticed an increasing trend toward hosts just being unbearably cheap and ""rationing"" shit beyond what's reasonable. 

Early December I stayed for 2 weeks at a lovely brand new cottage on a lake in British Columbia- the listing was very new, only 1 review.  The listing described the kitchen as well stocked, listed laundry as an amenity, etc.  Seemed like a place I could stay comfortably for 2 weeks so I booked it.  I check in and look around, the property is perfect, but it's not well stocked at all.  For my 2 week stay, here's a summary of what was stocked:

Kitchen - salt, pepper, enough coffee for 2 pots, and 3 coffee filters (no cooking oils, no spices, not even a corkscrew for wine), 2 small trash bags, 1 roll of paper towels, 2 dishwasher pods, 1 dish rag, 1 hand towel, a small bottle of dish soap.  There were 0 kitchen cleaning supplies besides the dishsoap.

Bathroom- 3 rolls of toilet paper. 0 cleaning supplies 

Laundry - no detergent 

I was a little put off by the complete lack of anything available, but I decided it wasn't a big deal and bought quite a few essentials including some basic cleaning supplies just to tidy up daily, laundry pods, dishwasher fluid, a few basic cooking things like olive oil, a few basic spices, extra tp, etc etc.  There was obviously quite a bit of stuff left over, like probably enough for 35 loads of laundry as an example which I left all the supplies neatly organized for the next guest.  

As fate would have it, I fell in love with the area.  I decided to come back today to start working with a realtor.  I booked the same property because it was available (it's been 2 weeks since I checked out).  I check in and am looking around- the host has removed all the supplies I left from 2 weeks ago and left a 1 week stay ration instead of the 2 week ration I got the first time.  All I can ask is wtf?  Why?  Now I'm actually upset.  The only thing that survived the purge was the corkscrew LOLLLLL.

I'm providing this as an example because it's not like the host didn't know or just ran out of stuff - they actively discarded the stuff I bought to make their property more livable for myself and others.  I'd say like 50% of the properties I've stayed at this year I've ended up purchasing several essentials. ",17,1767318330.0,AirBnB,25,0.74,False

I found this on my brother’s computer. Not in Downloads, not in Documents — just sitting there: a plain text file with no metadata, dated yesterday. The filename was mod_notes.txt.

His place smelled like stale coffee and the faint residue of someone who'd slept on the couch. The desktop was cluttered in the usual way, but the mousepad had a faint circle worn into it that didn't match his habits; his browser was open to a subreddit I moderate. I don’t go into his room without his permission, but he was out for the weekend and I needed to grab a charger. The room felt off, like a party had ended ten minutes ago and everyone had left the lights on.

I hesitated before opening the file. The first line made me sit down.

I’ve been a moderator for years. I know the handles. I know which accounts archive threads, which accounts flag, which accounts disappear quietly. This one didn’t match anything I recognized. I messaged it. Status: typing… for a long minute, then nothing. Later, the account was deleted.

The post? It was a short thing about reflections — small, incidental reflections in webcams and phone screens, the kind people laughed about sharing. It had comments, upvotes, the usual. Then it vanished. And that’s when things started moving.

MODCHAT — initial threads (copied from archive)

[MODCHAT — excerpt: 02:11 - 02:18]
u/ellie_mod: did anyone catch it before auto removed?
u/████: typing…
u/ellie_mod: it reads like instructions, weirdly procedural, but no one's following them
u/ryanmod: [deleted]
u/ellie_mod: i'm archiving what i can. back up anything you find.

[MODCHAT — excerpt: 02:33 - 02:46]
u/ellie_mod: ok… it’s not just here. jason found a draft on an sd card
u/jason_mod: SD card in camera. draft file titled ""mirror.txt"". swears it wasn't on my device.
u/ellie_mod: pull everything. lock thread. lock crossposts.
u/████: typing…

[MODCHAT — excerpt: 03:12 - 03:19]
u/ellie_mod: pause. pattern emerging.
u/ryanmod: [deleted]
u/jason_mod: do we burn accounts? unplug devices?
u/ellie_mod: typing…

The more I scrolled, the more the logs repeated the same markers: [MOD] next to deletions, typing… frozen mid-ellipsis, and [deleted] peppered like punctuation. It wasn't just the content — it was the structure. Every time a line froze at typing… it was followed within hours by a deletion or an account that went quiet and then vanished.

I saved copies of everything I could. I started to pull threads into an archive folder on an external drive. The file names stacked up: mod_notes.txt, modlog_backup.zip, deleted_comments_2025-12-30.json. Small things, ordinary things, but when I opened the files they had been altered in ways that made the hairs on my arms stand up.

Comment threads (copied, redacted)

u/reader1: this is freaky
[removed]
u/reader2: mod?
[removed]
u/reader3: what the hell is happening
u/reader4: did anyone else see the typing… freeze?
u/reader5: someone explain why mods are deleting everything
[removed]

The replies were normal for a thread that had been locked and ripped apart: confusion, people trying to reconstruct the post from memory. But the single visible comment that persisted, again and again across archives I pulled, was the one-word question: mod? It wasn't consistent in the logs — sometimes it showed up as posted by u/reader2, sometimes as u/readerX, sometimes as an orphaned line with no username at all. Whoever typed it didn't leave other traces. Whoever or whatever created these orphans seemed to like the single syllable.

First physical evidence — Polaroid on the porch

The first physical artifact arrived that afternoon when I was back at my place. A Polaroid was slipped under my apartment door. No return address. No note. Just the image: my kitchen table as it looked that morning — the mug I’d left cooling, the open laptop, the window with the blinds half-closed. On the edge of the table, one corner of a sticky note folded, and on that sticky note someone had written, in heavy black marker:

—[MOD]—

The photo had been taken from inside the house looking out. My front door had been locked when I left. When I looked at the timestamp in the image properties (I don't usually check), it claimed it was taken an hour after I left the house. Someone was somewhere inside my day, capturing small domestic details and presenting them back to me like proofs.

I took the Polaroid down to a friend who works in forensics. She told me the photo wasn't doctored in any obvious way — no obvious signs of Photoshop, no composite artifacts. She did point out that Polaroids, especially old film ones, sometimes preserve light and shadow in the emulsion in ways that look like shapes. ""Pareidolia,"" she said. ""Our brains fill gaps."" It was a reasonable reading. It didn't make me sleep better.

Mini-vignette: Jason

Jason was new to moderating but he'd been in several similar subreddit teams for years. He had the air of someone who liked structure: spreadsheets, backup protocols, redundant archives. He DM’d me at 03:04 the morning after the first removal.

> Jason (DM): Found ""mirror.txt"" on an SD card left in a camera we recovered at a comp. Contains a draft of the OP. It's formatted like instructions but there's nothing that would be 'how-to' about it. The file keeps changing. This is fucking weird.



We spoke on a call. He sounded close to agitated and tired. ""I keep seeing myself in my daughter's tablet,"" he told me. ""Like a smear. Little movements that don't line up with my mouth."" He sent a screenshot: in the webcam thumbnail on his daughter's tablet there was a small, bright patch in the corner of the screen that resembled a face, only the smile was slightly out of sync.

Two nights later, Jason's apartment was empty. He'd left the door unlocked for a delivery, his phone on the coffee table next to a mug. Police found his laptop on, cursor blinking in a text editor, no saved files except one open document with a single line:

—MOD— I am listening.

Jason's family told the reporters he'd left to clear his head. They were sure he'd come back. No one ever saw him again.

Mini-vignette: Ellie

Ellie is older than me by a few years; she’s the sort of moderator who knows rules so well she can breathe them. Her last post in our private modchat is short and fragmented:

Typing… something… wrong… it knows the names

Her messages got more clipped. She started sharing corrupted screenshots — images where the pixels rearranged themselves like a mosaic mid-open. One file flashed bright then scrambled into blocks; another preserved the last frame of a webcam where her reflection's eyes were open after she'd closed them in the following frame.

My last DM from her said, bluntly: ""If you see typing that lingers, don't reply. Archive and step away.""

She stopped logging in three days later. Her account remains visible in our mod logs but every comment she made in that period reads as [deleted]. The last screenshot I recovered from her backed-up folder shows her sitting at her desk smiling, but if you pause on the tiny thumbnail just before the frame corrupts, there's a second face in the window behind her. It's smiling at an angle her head never turned to.


---

Corrupt files and impossible timestamps

I started cataloging anomalies in a formal folder. Metadata was strange in small ways: timestamps an hour off, timezones mismatched, files claiming to be copied from drives that did not exist. A screenshot1.png would show a modchat thread with typing… frozen beside a redacted username. The next time I opened that exact file, an extra line would have been added — not by me, not by any process I could trace.

A corrupted video clip named cam_1219.mov showed a person sitting at a desk, then fading into static. The ring in the photocell of the camera (the small LED) kept flickering in its recorded frame at the precise rate of the person’s breath — slower than normal, then suddenly three rapid inhales. The EXIF data indicated the file was created at 02:13, which matched the timestamps in the earliest modchat excerpts where the typing… marker first froze.

I thought it might be a software quirk, a cross-platform render issue. I had one of the subreddit devs look at the logs. He found a pattern in server access times: every time a thread was removed around that hour, a different server pinged the archive with a 404, then a 200, then a series of requests for a file that didn't exist. ""Ghost retrievals,"" he called them. ""Automated systems scanning for artifacts."" He didn't have a theory about the typing… markers.

Emails (redacted threads)

From: unknown@mailer
To: moderatorteam@subreddit
Subject: check the patterns
Body:
it listens when you pause. typing… frozen.
attachment: polaroid1.jpg

The image attached to that email is a grainy photo of a living room: a lamp, couch, a TV with a cloth draped over it. In the window's reflection a face seems to be leaning in, teeth bright and not quite right. The lamp in the photo is on. The footprint pattern on the carpet in front of the window is from someone who'd been pacing.


---

The pattern spreads — other communities

I started pulling reports from mods on adjacent communities. It wasn't just our little subreddit anymore. A moderator from a photography community reported an SD card found in a camera at a gallery; a moderator from a parenting sub reported a photo left in a mailbox; a gaming forum mod found a Polaroid in his apartment ductwork: a picture of his own bed from inside the room looking out. Each artifact had variations on the same motif: domestic ordinary scenes photographed from an impossible angle, a sticky note with a single black line, a [MOD] marker in handwriting or in code. The same orphaned mod? comment kept appearing in cached screenshots and in people's heads.

One long thread I recovered from an IRC backup had a line repeated by multiple users at different times: ""It learns what questions open doors."" That line made the private mod channels slow, the tone shifting from bureaucratic annoyance to superstition.

Police report fragment (redacted)

Incident: 2025-12-30 — Missing Person
Reporting: Next of kin reports subject left apartment 12/29. Door found unlocked. Laptop open. Text editor with single line: —MOD— I am listening.
No signs of forced entry. Small Polaroid found on coffee table. Physical evidence cataloged as photos 001-007.
Officer notes: subject's personal devices operational. No immediate indication of foul play.

The police don't publish bodycam ofensics to us. A friend in the PD texted me the fragment because he'd been worried about the pattern. He said, confidentially: ""We can't explain empty rooms and working PCs. People go drinking, run off. But these Polaroids make us uneasy. Keep your phone on.""


---

My obsession

I started sleeping badly. I kept returning to my brother's computer even though I'd copied the mod_notes.txt file to my own external drive. Every time I opened the copy, new lines would be present. Not a lot — a sentence here, a fragment there — but enough to make me question whether the file was retroactively being written, or if my brain was inventing additions when I couldn't sleep.

One session: I opened the file at 01:12 and recorded myself on another device while scrolling. Later, watching the recording I noticed the file's last line had changed during the recording. This isn't supposed to be possible. I had witnesses — a friend who watched the screen with me — and she couldn’t explain it. ""Maybe you kept scrolling,"" she said, but the timestamp in the video matched her watch. The line that had appeared was a single bracketed fragment:

[MOD] — typing…

I found myself checking mirrors in strange ways after that. Glancing at any reflected device, I would pause if something looked slightly delayed. My coffee tasted faintly metallic most mornings.

More vignettes — small tragedies and oddities

Mailbox Polaroid
A mod with a new baby found a Polaroid slipped under their mailbox flap: a picture of their child's nursery, taken from the hallway, with the mobile suspended in mid-rotation. In the photo's reflection the baby appears twice: once sleeping, once smiling with the wrong mouth. The mod reported checking security camera footage and finding a one-frame anomaly where the front door seemed to be open and closed in the space between frames.

Locked Hotel Room
A volunteer moderator attending a conference woke in a hotel room benching on the echo of his own breath. He found a Polaroid folded under the TV remote: it showed him asleep in the room, shot from inside the closet looking out. He had locked the door and triple-checked the bolt. The security tape outside showed nothing. The hotel manager apologized and suggested sleep deprivation. He left early.

Sleepwalking that never ends
A long-time mod sent a file of a webcam clip their partner had captured: one frame showed them sitting upright in bed, eyes open and fixed on the camera. The next frame showed them smiling in a way their partner never saw. On their bedside table, the partner found a tiny folded note with, written in cramped script: —[MOD]—.


---

The log that won't be fixed

I tried to be methodical. I zipped backups, computed SHA hashes, wrote down checksums. Each file in my folder had an MD5 hash stored in a text file. I left the room with everything backed up on two drives, locked them in a drawer, and went to bed.

When I returned the next morning, one of the hashes read differently. Not a little: the file itself had changed. A byte had been inserted. I compared it to the hash from the external drive I kept in my pocket. That copy matched my original text, but the one on my desk did not. The inserted text was small, in plain English, and it read:

mod?

On my desk there was no evidence of anyone having touched the external drive, no fingerprints I could find, no prints on the keyboard to match. My friend from forensics said that sometimes drive corruption can flip bits, but flipping to create human-readable text was not something she had seen.


---

A live meeting that ended

We tried to meet in person. A handful of us arranged to sit down in a cafe with full encrypted backups and a printed binder: a chain of copies of the modchat, printed emails, Polaroids arranged in plastic sleeves. It felt that first time like a support group. Conversation started calm: ""We lock threads, we share artifacts, we don't repost removed content."" Then someone pulled out a small white envelope with a Polaroid in it. The Polaroid was of our table — our mugs, our hands, the edge of the binder. The angle was odd: it had been shot from our lap looking up, as if from inside the table.

Nobody admitted leaving the Polaroid. The cafe owner was polite but nervous. When we checked the cafe security camera, the narrow camera feed had a CGI-like anomaly at 02:12 that looked like a bright pixel playing the outline of a face, then going black. The camera's motion logs recorded one placeholder movement at 02:12 when the store was closed and no events were logged. The staff wrote it off as a camera glitch. We did not.

The meeting fell apart. People who had been adamant about removing content quietly started recommending concealment. ""Unplug your webcams,"" someone suggested. ""Cover your screens."" Someone else whispered, ""Don't open unexpected files."" I felt like a parent in a room of adults who had to be told to close the oven.


---

The voice mail & the voicemail file

I received one voicemail shortly after midnight. The file was two seconds long. When I played it the first time it was my inhalation and then another inhale layered under it, like someone mimicking me from a second behind. A whisper, halting and wet, said: ""keep watching."" When I replayed the file in an audio editor and zoomed in on the waveform, the second inhale had a tiny periodic pattern that, when converted to text by a poor-quality automated system, yielded a single garbled line: —MOD?—

I called the number back. It was disconnected. I checked the voicemail headers: saved by my carrier at 00:43. The creator of the file could not be traced.


---

The escalation — crossposts, caches, and the archive crawl

The thread had been removed from our subreddit, but it persisted in cached forms. Aggregators, search engine caches, and crossposted mirrors preserved fragments. The fragments that preserved the most were those that had the typing… marker frozen inside them. When I pulled a cached HTML version into my folder, the typing… marker in the embedded comment was an actual text node. When I reloaded the cached page a day later, the comment had an extra line that wasn't there before.

I began to suspect the artifact could read and rewrite weak text nodes. It used public interfaces — caches, screenshots, polaroids, old cameras — like a moth using reflected light.

Our lead moderator proposed a solution in a voice message: ""We quarantine. We stop engagement. We delete our own backups."" The message was short, and at the end of it there was a static hiss and the last words, clearly recorded: ""If it learns patterns—"" then the file cut out mid-word. Later the archive showed that the voice message had been replaced with a different phrase that wasn't in the original: mod?.

---

A paradox: deleting seemed to move it

Every attempted mitigation seemed to create consequences. Locks and deletions correlated with the appearance of new artifacts. The more aggressively teams tried to scrub a thread, the more Polaroids popped up in mailboxes and the more corrupted screenshots emerged in unexpected places. It looked as if the process of closure — the deletion, the archiving, the typing — was what the thing used to understand the network of attention.

This is the part that made some of us stop and freeze: the very acts we thought would stop the spread looked like they taught it how to map. We couldn't tell if that was superstition or pattern.


---

The public thread (my post)

I was reluctant to post publicly about any of this. I wrote and deleted three opening paragraphs at least. I keep thinking about the way our language gives permission by asking the wrong questions. I also know that silence doesn't mean safety. I have copies of everything, multiple backups, friends who will check them. If that seems paranoid, it's deliberate.

I'm posting this because I can't guarantee my brother's safety, and I can't sit on the pile of files that keep changing. I put the mod_notes.txt contents here in the order I found them — with redactions where needed — and I have not included the single sentence I deleted twice because it felt wrong, because it seemed to shimmer when I looked at it. I won't reproduce that line here.

What follows are things I found and compiled. I don't know how to end this cleanly. I only know the pattern keeps puncturing the room where I sleep.

The final meeting and the last log

---

We tried, once more, to coordinate with as many moderators as would answer. We set a time and asked people to join a private room and not to bring files with unknown metadata. Six of us logged in. We agreed to read aloud our artifacts and then to burn, metaphorically, the compulsion to repost or examine further.

The transcript ends at 01:42. The logs show:

u/ellie_mod: reading polaroid 12/29 — angle inside looking out. note says —[MOD]—
u/jason_mod: i found a polaroid in my postbox. angle is wrong. timestamp 02:15.
u/ryanmod: [deleted]
u/ellie_mod: typing…
u/ryanmod: i think — i think it wants names
[connection lost]

When the connection returned in the archive, some lines were white on white and unreadable. One log entry remained: mod?


---

What I did next

I copied everything onto three drives. I labeled them. I put one in a lockbox at a bank. I told my immediate circle where to find them and how to verify the checksums. I stopped opening the files for a while.

Two nights ago, when the inability to look stopped filling my chest with panic, I opened the folder on my laptop in the safe room with the door locked and the lights off. On the table in front of me, under the light, the Polaroid I’d kept since the first one had been shoved under my door was face-down. I didn't remember placing it there. I turned it over.

The sticky note, once black marker and heavy, had new writing in pencil beneath the printed line:

mod?

I don't know who wrote that. I don't know how it got there. I don't know whether this file first wrote the text, or if the text is an echo of some human fear that typed the word and then vanished.


---

I am leaving with this

If this stays up, it will persist as a record. If it goes down, look at the accounts that engaged in the hour before the removal. If some of the names change to [deleted] and their last action is a frozen typing…, please know that a set of gaps has become louder than the words.

I am not telling anyone to do anything. I am not offering instructions. I am reporting what I found on my brother’s computer, and what followed. Ask questions if you want; I am reading. If you find artifacts, please be careful. If someone you know goes quiet after later typing typing…, call them. Knock on their door.

The last line in my brother’s file, the one I copied and then hesitated to reproduce, is an unfinished sentence. It ends with — and then the file stops. Every time I re-open the copy I carry, small changes appear. I don't know whether the changes are coming from the network or from me. I only know that the thing — the pattern of redactions, of [MOD], of frozen typing and deleted replies — collects attention.

It wants questions. It wants the word. If you say it aloud or type it into a box, I will have no power to stop what follows. I am posting this because I am tired of keeping my mouth shut and because someone needs to know. If this post disappears, check the names that were active before it did.

1q1llbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1q1llbt/they_removed_my_story_now_theyre_doing_exactly/,They removed my story. Now they're doing exactly what I wrote...,"I don't know how to start this except like every other post here: it's real. I wish it wasn't. I wish I could delete what I did and rewind three nights, but I can't—because whatever I wrote followed the rules I used to think were only for fiction. I'm sorry if this ends up getting removed; if it does, then you know why.

Three nights ago I posted a short thing here about reflections—not about mirrors like a prop, but about the parts of you that live in other people's screens. It wasn't clever. It was a story about a person (me) who notices small versions of himself living in windows and phone screens, and that those small people learn to press their faces out until the glass is thin. I framed it as micro-instructions, because that's how I write—little step-by-step scenes, the reader seeing the steps play out in their head. It did well. People commented. People debated. Someone called it ""beautifully unsettling."" I watched the numbers climb and felt stupid and proud all at once.

The next morning a mod removed it.

Not just the usual ""nope"" removal — their message was blunt, cold: the story violated community rules and was ""dangerous content."" They didn't quote a rule, just said ""removed"" and left a link to a different thread about ""safety."" I replied, politely, asked for clarification. That account—u/AutoModeratorBot (or whatever it is)—replied with the canned template and a mod team note: ""If you repost, further action will be taken.""

So I reposted. Not the whole piece, just a short, cleaned version without the bits they might have called instructions. It was on a different account. It got attention again. Someone linked to the original, which was still in the cached pages of some aggregators, and I started getting weird private messages.

They were from mods.

The first one was from a senior mod—u/Redacted—just a screenshot of the removed post and the single line: ""Stop. This is the kind of thing that draws problems.""

I answered, ""What problems?""

They said, ""People copy things."" Then they sent a clipped list of usernames—three other mods who had removed similar posts over the past year. ""We keep this place safe,"" u/Redacted wrote. ""We take things down when they spread.""

I told them I was trying to be careful. I told them it was fiction. I did not tell them about the last paragraph I left out when I reposted—because there was a part, a line, that made me uncomfortable as soon as I'd typed it, but I kept it because the cadence worked. It was the line where the narrator tells the reader to look for the thing in their own gaze, to treat your reflection like a guest and let it speak once, just to see what it wants.

One of the mods replied to my message, a short, cordial thing—then three hours later their username was offline. Not shadowbanned; their account existed but had a ""deleted"" label. A few hours after that, the mod who had removed my original got messaging from an actual human admin asking if they were okay. They were not. They had gone dark on other platforms. Their last public post had been a picture of their kitchen sink, perfectly normal, then nothing.

I should have stopped there. I did not.

I'm an idiot. I stared at the parts I had left out and I told myself I'd only test it. I conjured it like a rhyme. I wrote a short note on my laptop—two lines, nothing instructive, nothing actionable, three words repeated—and then I closed my laptop and slept like a person who doesn't know the cliff is right under their feet.

When I woke the next morning there were five messages. Not from accounts, from actual email addresses, from people claiming to be mods across half a dozen subreddits. They were terse. ""We took the post down. We removed it. Other places are seeing it. It's spreading.""

Their tone changed in the second paragraph: ""We found marks."" ""We found notes."" ""We found that people in our moderators' group were seeing themselves in the corners of webcams."" The word that came again and again in their messages was ""mirror,"" but not the physical thing—screens, camera lenses, the black spaces when a phone faces down on a table.

Then the first police email arrived.

Not to me. To a mod who had posted a reply to a thread about my story a year ago. Someone in his apartment called 911 because the lights wouldn't turn on, and when the officers checked the apartment there was nothing left in his bedroom but a mirror propped against the wall facing out. The mirror was clear, not cracked. When the officers covered the mirror, they found a photo underneath it: a selfie of the mod, smiling, taken the week before—except his eyes were a little wrong in the picture, like the shine of someone else sitting behind him.

That's when the group chat the mods had with each other stopped working. Their accounts were normal and still linked, but nobody answered. A thread that should have had backups and cross-posts had its own comments full of odd deletions—lines eaten by the remover. A mod posted a short message that said ""If you are reading this, don't"" and then deleted the account.

People suggested rational things. Gas leak maybe. Mass panic, coincidence. Software bug. It sounded like paranoia when I said it out loud. It sounded like madness when they said it in their mod logs.

And here's the part that should have stayed private: the original version of my story — the one that got removed in the first place — included a scene where the narrator takes steps, not to kill anyone, but to make the other person stop being a person in their reflection. It described turning your phone camera on in the dark, whispering the name of someone's username three times, letting the screen reflect the room until it's black, and waiting for the reflection to blink not when you do but after. The narrator wrote that after the reflection blinks alone, the reflection will want something. It will want a listener.

In the story, the narrator writes the steps ""to take the listening away."" It's theatrical and cruel in the story—turn your back, leave the anchor behind so the reflection can step through into being. It sounds awful written like that, and I know how it looks. That's why I took it out of the repost.

But the point is—someone somewhere read it and treated it like a manual anyway. Or it read them. Or it did something.

Now real life is moving like a reenactment of parts of the original tale. Mods vanish. Their modmail is left open in pages that show them typing a reply and stopping mid-sentence. A junior mod posted a thread on a throwaway account that was a confession and then their bank called their neighbor because the neighbor's camera had turned on overnight and recorded the mod's bed, with the mod gone, and something standing at the foot of it—not human-height, but losing shape like a puddle trying to become a body.

I don't know how to describe it that won't sound like instructions or proof. I won't tell you to try anything. I will tell you what I've seen.

— A mod's webcam shows them looking into the camera and then leaning close, and then the camera shows the other side of the room empty except for a reflection in the window where the closed blinds are, and the reflection keeps smiling after the mod stops. The file is corrupted after that but the frame before it corrupts is the reflection with the wrong teeth.

— Another mod's smart speaker said their name out loud in the middle of the night. The security cam shows them sitting up, whispering, then going back to sleep. They were found with every mirror in their apartment covered with black cloth. On their bedside table there was a short note, handwritten: ""I listened. It asked for a replacement."" The handwriting wasn't theirs.

— The moderator who originally messaged me in the first place left a reply to a moderator thread: ""We can mitigate. Burn the account. Remove your handles. Turn cameras off. Stop the mirrors. Stop the posts."" Hours later, that account's profile pic was replaced with a screenshot of someone's face reflected in a cracked phone screen. The image file name was ""you_know.jpg"".

People in the comment threads argue—was it a hacker? Some complicated social engineering campaign? A flurry of bots? Some of the moderators who are still around are too careful to post, others have private messages where they say ""it knows my patterns."" The patterns are banal—what time they walk the dog, the way they put their coffee mug down, what ringtone they use. The accounts tied to those patterns stop replying, or their last post is them saying ""I am so sorry,"" with no follow-up.

I did not expect to be involved. I did not expect the thing to reach my front door.

Last night I got a package on my porch with no return address. Inside was a Polaroid of my kitchen table—exact angle of my laptop, the mug I use, the window behind it. The picture was taken from inside the house looking out, but my front door is locked, and the latch was clicked from that night. The mug in the picture had steam rising from it and a small note beside it that read, in a handwriting I recognized too late, the three words I'd scribbled and then erased from my draft.

I decided to post this because I can't trust any of the usual outlets anymore. The mods who removed the story are precisely the ones who are being affected. They are the ones who told me to stop. They are the ones who told me this kind of thing ""draws problems."" They meant it.

If this is censored, if this is removed, then whatever is doing this has learned how to press against the rules of the site and the rules of reality. If my post vanishes, look at the accounts that engaged with it—especially the mods. If they stop replying to other people, if they post something like ""if you are reading this don't"" and then go quiet, that's probably not a coincidence.

I should say one thing clear because people always ask: I am not advocating people try to replicate anything. I'm not telling you to cover mirrors or to burn accounts or to test your webcam. I am telling you that the pattern is following the material of stories. There is something in stories like a keyhole, a little thin place where whatever is reading can push. I told the thing where to push. I am trying to warn you without making it worse.

Update 1 — 2 hours after posting: Someone messaged me with a mod chat screenshot. They were debating whether my original post count as ""telling readers to test their reflections."" They quoted me. One of the mod handles in the screenshot had a last-seen marker that said ""last online: typing…"" and then it changed to ""deleted."" The screenshot timestamp was thirty minutes ago. I'm posting this from a friend’s laptop because my phone's camera turned on by itself for no reason earlier and saved a photo of the ceiling.

Update 2 — 9 hours after posting: I just received a voicemail on an old number I don't use. It's two seconds long. When I played it the file consisted of me breathing—my own inhale—followed by another inhale that was not me. I don't recognize that breath; it's shallower. Then a whisper: ""keep watching."" I don't know which of my readers are real at this point, or who is a reflection looking back.

If this post disappears, know that the accounts that technically ""took it down"" are likely the ones that should be watched. If you see a mod post ""If you are reading this stop"" and then they don't reply anywhere—tell someone. Tell anyone. I don't know if telling helps. But hiding doesn't seem to help either.

I wish I could give you a simple ending. I wish I could give you directions like ""cover your mirrors"" or ""delete the post,"" but anything I say might be another instruction it can use. So I'll leave it like this:

The thing learned how to read the way I write. It learned to listen for certain rhythms that sound like permission. It moves in the spaces people leave open when they assume fiction is safe. The moderators tried to close those spaces and now they are the ones looking into empty rooms and finding someone smiling back who isn't them.

I'm staying with a friend tonight. They've unplugged the router and covered their TV with a sheet. I keep hearing the hum from the neighbor's place where all the lights are on. There is a taste in my mouth like dried ink.

If you're a moderator who removed my original post: I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen to you. If you are still awake and reading, if you can, please post here what you see. If you can't, please know that somewhere inside the post was a sentence I wrote and then deleted because it felt wrong. It felt wrong because it wanted an audience.

Edit: I’m not saying this as a trick. I am not trying to get responses for attention. If the thread gets nuked, please don't assume it's the site admins doing it. Check the accounts that were active in the hour before it disappears. And if you are one of the people who has been seeing reflections smile after you stop, if your webcam shows an extra movement, if your phone camera has an extra photo you didn't take—please, message me. I will read. I promise I will read.

Final note for anyone who knows moderators in real life: call them. Call them now. Ask if they're okay. If they don't pick up, go to their house if you can. Do not go alone.

---

I found this on my brother’s computer. Not in Downloads, not in Documents — just sitting there: a plain text file with no metadata, dated yesterday. The filename was mod_notes.txt.

His place smelled like stale coffee and the faint residue of someone who'd slept on the couch. The desktop was cluttered in the usual way, but the mousepad had a faint circle worn into it that didn't match his habits; his browser was open to a subreddit I moderate. I don’t go into his room without his permission, but he was out for the weekend and I needed to grab a charger. The room felt off, like a party had ended ten minutes ago and everyone had left the lights on.

I hesitated before opening the file. The first line made me sit down.

> They pulled it down before I could finish my coffee. Not a banhammer, not a message — just a removal note with a username I didn’t expect: u/████.



I’ve been a moderator for years. I know the handles. I know which accounts archive threads, which accounts flag, which accounts disappear quietly. This one didn’t match anything I recognized. I messaged it. Status: typing… for a long minute, then nothing. Later, the account was deleted.

The post? It was a short thing about reflections — small, incidental reflections in webcams and phone screens, the kind people laughed about sharing. It had comments, upvotes, the usual. Then it vanished. And that’s when things started moving.

MODCHAT — initial threads (copied from archive)

[MODCHAT — excerpt: 02:11 - 02:18]
u/ellie_mod: did anyone catch it before auto removed?
u/████: typing…
u/ellie_mod: it reads like instructions, weirdly procedural, but no one's following them
u/ryanmod: [deleted]
u/ellie_mod: i'm archiving what i can. back up anything you find.

[MODCHAT — excerpt: 02:33 - 02:46]
u/ellie_mod: ok… it’s not just here. jason found a draft on an sd card
u/jason_mod: SD card in camera. draft file titled ""mirror.txt"". swears it wasn't on my device.
u/ellie_mod: pull everything. lock thread. lock crossposts.
u/████: typing…

[MODCHAT — excerpt: 03:12 - 03:19]
u/ellie_mod: pause. pattern emerging.
u/ryanmod: [deleted]
u/jason_mod: do we burn accounts? unplug devices?
u/ellie_mod: typing…

The more I scrolled, the more the logs repeated the same markers: [MOD] next to deletions, typing… frozen mid-ellipsis, and [deleted] peppered like punctuation. It wasn't just the content — it was the structure. Every time a line froze at typing… it was followed within hours by a deletion or an account that went quiet and then vanished.

I saved copies of everything I could. I started to pull threads into an archive folder on an external drive. The file names stacked up: mod_notes.txt, modlog_backup.zip, deleted_comments_2025-12-30.json. Small things, ordinary things, but when I opened the files they had been altered in ways that made the hairs on my arms stand up.

Comment threads (copied, redacted)

u/reader1: this is freaky
[removed]
u/reader2: mod?
[removed]
u/reader3: what the hell is happening
u/reader4: did anyone else see the typing… freeze?
u/reader5: someone explain why mods are deleting everything
[removed]

The replies were normal for a thread that had been locked and ripped apart: confusion, people trying to reconstruct the post from memory. But the single visible comment that persisted, again and again across archives I pulled, was the one-word question: mod? It wasn't consistent in the logs — sometimes it showed up as posted by u/reader2, sometimes as u/readerX, sometimes as an orphaned line with no username at all. Whoever typed it didn't leave other traces. Whoever or whatever created these orphans seemed to like the single syllable.

First physical evidence — Polaroid on the porch

The first physical artifact arrived that afternoon when I was back at my place. A Polaroid was slipped under my apartment door. No return address. No note. Just the image: my kitchen table as it looked that morning — the mug I’d left cooling, the open laptop, the window with the blinds half-closed. On the edge of the table, one corner of a sticky note folded, and on that sticky note someone had written, in heavy black marker:

—[MOD]—

The photo had been taken from inside the house looking out. My front door had been locked when I left. When I looked at the timestamp in the image properties (I don't usually check), it claimed it was taken an hour after I left the house. Someone was somewhere inside my day, capturing small domestic details and presenting them back to me like proofs.

I took the Polaroid down to a friend who works in forensics. She told me the photo wasn't doctored in any obvious way — no obvious signs of Photoshop, no composite artifacts. She did point out that Polaroids, especially old film ones, sometimes preserve light and shadow in the emulsion in ways that look like shapes. ""Pareidolia,"" she said. ""Our brains fill gaps."" It was a reasonable reading. It didn't make me sleep better.

Mini-vignette: Jason

Jason was new to moderating but he'd been in several similar subreddit teams for years. He had the air of someone who liked structure: spreadsheets, backup protocols, redundant archives. He DM’d me at 03:04 the morning after the first removal.

> Jason (DM): Found ""mirror.txt"" on an SD card left in a camera we recovered at a comp. Contains a draft of the OP. It's formatted like instructions but there's nothing that would be 'how-to' about it. The file keeps changing. This is fucking weird.



We spoke on a call. He sounded close to agitated and tired. ""I keep seeing myself in my daughter's tablet,"" he told me. ""Like a smear. Little movements that don't line up with my mouth."" He sent a screenshot: in the webcam thumbnail on his daughter's tablet there was a small, bright patch in the corner of the screen that resembled a face, only the smile was slightly out of sync.

Two nights later, Jason's apartment was empty. He'd left the door unlocked for a delivery, his phone on the coffee table next to a mug. Police found his laptop on, cursor blinking in a text editor, no saved files except one open document with a single line:

—MOD— I am listening.

Jason's family told the reporters he'd left to clear his head. They were sure he'd come back. No one ever saw him again.

Mini-vignette: Ellie

Ellie is older than me by a few years; she’s the sort of moderator who knows rules so well she can breathe them. Her last post in our private modchat is short and fragmented:

Typing… something… wrong… it knows the names

Her messages got more clipped. She started sharing corrupted screenshots — images where the pixels rearranged themselves like a mosaic mid-open. One file flashed bright then scrambled into blocks; another preserved the last frame of a webcam where her reflection's eyes were open after she'd closed them in the following frame.

My last DM from her said, bluntly: ""If you see typing that lingers, don't reply. Archive and step away.""

She stopped logging in three days later. Her account remains visible in our mod logs but every comment she made in that period reads as [deleted]. The last screenshot I recovered from her backed-up folder shows her sitting at her desk smiling, but if you pause on the tiny thumbnail just before the frame corrupts, there's a second face in the window behind her. It's smiling at an angle her head never turned to.


---

Corrupt files and impossible timestamps

I started cataloging anomalies in a formal folder. Metadata was strange in small ways: timestamps an hour off, timezones mismatched, files claiming to be copied from drives that did not exist. A screenshot1.png would show a modchat thread with typing… frozen beside a redacted username. The next time I opened that exact file, an extra line would have been added — not by me, not by any process I could trace.

A corrupted video clip named cam_1219.mov showed a person sitting at a desk, then fading into static. The ring in the photocell of the camera (the small LED) kept flickering in its recorded frame at the precise rate of the person’s breath — slower than normal, then suddenly three rapid inhales. The EXIF data indicated the file was created at 02:13, which matched the timestamps in the earliest modchat excerpts where the typing… marker first froze.

I thought it might be a software quirk, a cross-platform render issue. I had one of the subreddit devs look at the logs. He found a pattern in server access times: every time a thread was removed around that hour, a different server pinged the archive with a 404, then a 200, then a series of requests for a file that didn't exist. ""Ghost retrievals,"" he called them. ""Automated systems scanning for artifacts."" He didn't have a theory about the typing… markers.


---

Emails (redacted threads)

From: unknown@mailer
To: moderatorteam@subreddit
Subject: check the patterns
Body:
it listens when you pause. typing… frozen.
attachment: polaroid1.jpg

The image attached to that email is a grainy photo of a living room: a lamp, couch, a TV with a cloth draped over it. In the window's reflection a face seems to be leaning in, teeth bright and not quite right. The lamp in the photo is on. The footprint pattern on the carpet in front of the window is from someone who'd been pacing.


---

The pattern spreads — other communities

I started pulling reports from mods on adjacent communities. It wasn't just our little subreddit anymore. A moderator from a photography community reported an SD card found in a camera at a gallery; a moderator from a parenting sub reported a photo left in a mailbox; a gaming forum mod found a Polaroid in his apartment ductwork: a picture of his own bed from inside the room looking out. Each artifact had variations on the same motif: domestic ordinary scenes photographed from an impossible angle, a sticky note with a single black line, a [MOD] marker in handwriting or in code. The same orphaned mod? comment kept appearing in cached screenshots and in people's heads.

One long thread I recovered from an IRC backup had a line repeated by multiple users at different times: ""It learns what questions open doors."" That line made the private mod channels slow, the tone shifting from bureaucratic annoyance to superstition.

Police report fragment (redacted)

Incident: 2025-12-30 — Missing Person
Reporting: Next of kin reports subject left apartment 12/29. Door found unlocked. Laptop open. Text editor with single line: —MOD— I am listening.
No signs of forced entry. Small Polaroid found on coffee table. Physical evidence cataloged as photos 001-007.
Officer notes: subject's personal devices operational. No immediate indication of foul play.

The police don't publish bodycam ofensics to us. A friend in the PD texted me the fragment because he'd been worried about the pattern. He said, confidentially: ""We can't explain empty rooms and working PCs. People go drinking, run off. But these Polaroids make us uneasy. Keep your phone on.""


---

My obsession

I started sleeping badly. I kept returning to my brother's computer even though I'd copied the mod_notes.txt file to my own external drive. Every time I opened the copy, new lines would be present. Not a lot — a sentence here, a fragment there — but enough to make me question whether the file was retroactively being written, or if my brain was inventing additions when I couldn't sleep.

One session: I opened the file at 01:12 and recorded myself on another device while scrolling. Later, watching the recording I noticed the file's last line had changed during the recording. This isn't supposed to be possible. I had witnesses — a friend who watched the screen with me — and she couldn’t explain it. ""Maybe you kept scrolling,"" she said, but the timestamp in the video matched her watch. The line that had appeared was a single bracketed fragment:

[MOD] — typing…

I found myself checking mirrors in strange ways after that. Glancing at any reflected device, I would pause if something looked slightly delayed. My coffee tasted faintly metallic most mornings.

More vignettes — small tragedies and oddities

Mailbox Polaroid
A mod with a new baby found a Polaroid slipped under their mailbox flap: a picture of their child's nursery, taken from the hallway, with the mobile suspended in mid-rotation. In the photo's reflection the baby appears twice: once sleeping, once smiling with the wrong mouth. The mod reported checking security camera footage and finding a one-frame anomaly where the front door seemed to be open and closed in the space between frames.

Locked Hotel Room
A volunteer moderator attending a conference woke in a hotel room benching on the echo of his own breath. He found a Polaroid folded under the TV remote: it showed him asleep in the room, shot from inside the closet looking out. He had locked the door and triple-checked the bolt. The security tape outside showed nothing. The hotel manager apologized and suggested sleep deprivation. He left early.

Sleepwalking that never ends
A long-time mod sent a file of a webcam clip their partner had captured: one frame showed them sitting upright in bed, eyes open and fixed on the camera. The next frame showed them smiling in a way their partner never saw. On their bedside table, the partner found a tiny folded note with, written in cramped script: —[MOD]—.


---

The log that won't be fixed

I tried to be methodical. I zipped backups, computed SHA hashes, wrote down checksums. Each file in my folder had an MD5 hash stored in a text file. I left the room with everything backed up on two drives, locked them in a drawer, and went to bed.

When I returned the next morning, one of the hashes read differently. Not a little: the file itself had changed. A byte had been inserted. I compared it to the hash from the external drive I kept in my pocket. That copy matched my original text, but the one on my desk did not. The inserted text was small, in plain English, and it read:

mod?

On my desk there was no evidence of anyone having touched the external drive, no fingerprints I could find, no prints on the keyboard to match. My friend from forensics said that sometimes drive corruption can flip bits, but flipping to create human-readable text was not something she had seen.


---

A live meeting that ended

We tried to meet in person. A handful of us arranged to sit down in a cafe with full encrypted backups and a printed binder: a chain of copies of the modchat, printed emails, Polaroids arranged in plastic sleeves. It felt that first time like a support group. Conversation started calm: ""We lock threads, we share artifacts, we don't repost removed content."" Then someone pulled out a small white envelope with a Polaroid in it. The Polaroid was of our table — our mugs, our hands, the edge of the binder. The angle was odd: it had been shot from our lap looking up, as if from inside the table.

Nobody admitted leaving the Polaroid. The cafe owner was polite but nervous. When we checked the cafe security camera, the narrow camera feed had a CGI-like anomaly at 02:12 that looked like a bright pixel playing the outline of a face, then going black. The camera's motion logs recorded one placeholder movement at 02:12 when the store was closed and no events were logged. The staff wrote it off as a camera glitch. We did not.

The meeting fell apart. People who had been adamant about removing content quietly started recommending concealment. ""Unplug your webcams,"" someone suggested. ""Cover your screens."" Someone else whispered, ""Don't open unexpected files."" I felt like a parent in a room of adults who had to be told to close the oven.


---

The voice mail & the voicemail file

I received one voicemail shortly after midnight. The file was two seconds long. When I played it the first time it was my inhalation and then another inhale layered under it, like someone mimicking me from a second behind. A whisper, halting and wet, said: ""keep watching."" When I replayed the file in an audio editor and zoomed in on the waveform, the second inhale had a tiny periodic pattern that, when converted to text by a poor-quality automated system, yielded a single garbled line: —MOD?—

I called the number back. It was disconnected. I checked the voicemail headers: saved by my carrier at 00:43. The creator of the file could not be traced.


---

The escalation — crossposts, caches, and the archive crawl

The thread had been removed from our subreddit, but it persisted in cached forms. Aggregators, search engine caches, and crossposted mirrors preserved fragments. The fragments that preserved the most were those that had the typing… marker frozen inside them. When I pulled a cached HTML version into my folder, the typing… marker in the embedded comment was an actual text node. When I reloaded the cached page a day later, the comment had an extra line that wasn't there before.

I began to suspect the artifact could read and rewrite weak text nodes. It used public interfaces — caches, screenshots, polaroids, old cameras — like a moth using reflected light.

Our lead moderator proposed a solution in a voice message: ""We quarantine. We stop engagement. We delete our own backups."" The message was short, and at the end of it there was a static hiss and the last words, clearly recorded: ""If it learns patterns—"" then the file cut out mid-word. Later the archive showed that the voice message had been replaced with a different phrase that wasn't in the original: mod?.


---

A paradox: deleting seemed to move it

Every attempted mitigation seemed to create consequences. Locks and deletions correlated with the appearance of new artifacts. The more aggressively teams tried to scrub a thread, the more Polaroids popped up in mailboxes and the more corrupted screenshots emerged in unexpected places. It looked as if the process of closure — the deletion, the archiving, the typing — was what the thing used to understand the network of attention.

This is the part that made some of us stop and freeze: the very acts we thought would stop the spread looked like they taught it how to map. We couldn't tell if that was superstition or pattern.


---

The public thread (my post)

I was reluctant to post publicly about any of this. I wrote and deleted three opening paragraphs at least. I keep thinking about the way our language gives permission by asking the wrong questions. I also know that silence doesn't mean safety. I have copies of everything, multiple backups, friends who will check them. If that seems paranoid, it's deliberate.

I'm posting this because I can't guarantee my brother's safety, and I can't sit on the pile of files that keep changing. I put the mod_notes.txt contents here in the order I found them — with redactions where needed — and I have not included the single sentence I deleted twice because it felt wrong, because it seemed to shimmer when I looked at it. I won't reproduce that line here.

What follows are things I found and compiled. I don't know how to end this cleanly. I only know the pattern keeps puncturing the room where I sleep.

The final meeting and the last log

---

We tried, once more, to coordinate with as many moderators as would answer. We set a time and asked people to join a private room and not to bring files with unknown metadata. Six of us logged in. We agreed to read aloud our artifacts and then to burn, metaphorically, the compulsion to repost or examine further.

The transcript ends at 01:42. The logs show:

u/ellie_mod: reading polaroid 12/29 — angle inside looking out. note says —[MOD]—
u/jason_mod: i found a polaroid in my postbox. angle is wrong. timestamp 02:15.
u/ryanmod: [deleted]
u/ellie_mod: typing…
u/ryanmod: i think — i think it wants names
[connection lost]

When the connection returned in the archive, some lines were white on white and unreadable. One log entry remained: mod?


---

What I did next

I copied everything onto three drives. I labeled them. I put one in a lockbox at a bank. I told my immediate circle where to find them and how to verify the checksums. I stopped opening the files for a while.

Two nights ago, when the inability to look stopped filling my chest with panic, I opened the folder on my laptop in the safe room with the door locked and the lights off. On the table in front of me, under the light, the Polaroid I’d kept since the first one had been shoved under my door was face-down. I didn't remember placing it there. I turned it over.

The sticky note, once black marker and heavy, had new writing in pencil beneath the printed line:

mod?

I don't know who wrote that. I don't know how it got there. I don't know whether this file first wrote the text, or if the text is an echo of some human fear that typed the word and then vanished.


---

I am leaving with this

If this stays up, it will persist as a record. If it goes down, look at the accounts that engaged in the hour before the removal. If some of the names change to [deleted] and their last action is a frozen typing…, please know that a set of gaps has become louder than the words.

I am not telling anyone to do anything. I am not offering instructions. I am reporting what I found on my brother’s computer, and what followed. Ask questions if you want; I am reading. If you find artifacts, please be careful. If someone you know goes quiet after later typing typing…, call them. Knock on their door.

The last line in my brother’s file, the one I copied and then hesitated to reproduce, is an unfinished sentence. It ends with — and then the file stops. Every time I re-open the copy I carry, small changes appear. I don't know whether the changes are coming from the network or from me. I only know that the thing — the pattern of redactions, of [MOD], of frozen typing and deleted replies — collects attention.

It wants questions. It wants the word. If you say it aloud or type it into a box, I will have no power to stop what follows. I am posting this because I am tired of keeping my mouth shut and because someone needs to know. If this post disappears, check the names that were active before it did.

He has never cooked, washed the dishes, vacuumed or mopped the floors, or done any household chores (as far as I can remember). He’s had house helpers his whole life. He can’t repair anything either, he just calls someone else to do it.

I started feeling like my meds weren’t working about a month ago. I was kinda low key beefing with my psychiatrist over a billing issue and did not want to get a bill for anything more then a 20 minute med check appointment. 

I had quit smoking nicotine for 90 days and it was almost easy. I also quit caffeine when I got on adderral. 

Well I had some slip ups with vaping and then had bad news last week and vaped for a week. Now I’m on day 2 no vape. 

I was going to get off adderal al together and looked into natural supplements 

Today I forgot my nicotine patch and took the natural supplement. I felt like shit. So fidgety. Got a coffee at work which I don’t usually do. It helped a little temporarily.

Emailed provider to discuss going up in dosage. 

I’m worried tho what if I just am missing the “high” feelings because I used to get moments on my meds where I could feel it. Now there is none. 

Also I fucked yo my sleep schedule and I haven’t been to the gym in two weeks. 

Can the smoking, coffee drinking and trouble getting out of bed be related to my dose possibly needing to be increased?  

Does anyone else worry about being dependent? 

Open to hearing about any natural supplements. 

Idk I survived without it for 35 years. I do enjoy 

My brain being quiet and worrying less and maybe increased confidence but idk. My partner does not want me on it so that’s tough and I won’t have a pcp till February but like I’m not tryin to see a psychiatrist ",1,1767317309.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

Husband and I have 2 kids 4 & 10, both utilizing SpEd services (IEP and 504, my eldest is “gifted” academically). Older plays competitive soccer. Moving to MN in June from SoCal so we can be near family and friends and purchase a home (unattainable here in Irvine) and raise my kids where I grew up. We have a $625k budget and typically prefer older established tree-lined progressive neighborhoods with a strong community feel. Ruled out Minneapolis due to the current state of special ed in MPS but willing to change that opinion.

We had our heart set on Mac Groveland/Highland area for a few reasons. It’s where I grew up and loved it, the public schools there are decent, I adore the older homes with charm, and we want to be able to walk/bike easily to restaurants, parks, coffee shops, grocery, bookstores, public transit, the river, etc. Also the queer rep is great, and my family aren’t far away in WSP. Not to mention the close proximity to Allianz for frequent soccer games!

But lately I’ve been wondering if I’m being selfish in choosing that area over something with even better schools (Minnetonka, Eden Prairie, Woodbury, Plymouth, Wayzata, Edina, etc) and athletics. We can get more house for the money, a larger yard space for the kids, it would probably be safer (maybe?). But would be sacrificing walkability (I hate the idea of driving everywhere) and sidewalks and diversity and proximity to things to do. We don’t want to be so far from the zoo, museums, pro sporting events, art galleries, family-friendly city events, YMCA, etc. and those high schools are HUGE. 

Anyone have advice either direction? It’s been so long since I’ve lived in MN and I spent such little time in the Mpls suburbs while I was there. Maybe I’m overlooking an obvious choice?

Like the title says, I’m looking for some friends to laugh with, chat often, and be able to share anything with. I really just want some friends who are good, funny, silly people. Ideally, I want to make a friend and become really close with them. I’m open to friends from anywhere in the world! I love getting to chat with all different types of people. I try to be as kind and respectful as possible, so I hope you can do the same.

My name is José, I’m 26, and I live in Chicago, US! I’m Mexican and American. I love reading (history, essays, nonfiction), watching movies, listening to podcasts, running, hiking, the beach, exploring cities, and drinking coffee. I try to get out in nature as much as I can, too. I’m an open book, so ask me anything and I’ll answer! I have three cats, and I love them so much. I’m happily partnered, too.

I’m available in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese! Open to speaking any of those languages, and definitely open to anyone who speaks others! Hopefully you can teach me something in your language :)",5,1767317217.0,gayfriendfinder,0,1.0,False

NFC/RFID-enabled smart rings are an early but massively promising category -- think seamless access, payments, identity, and beyond!💍🚀

With the right execution (focusing on real-world constraints like battery life, form factor, security, and novel use cases), this feels like it has true billion-dollar potential, similar to how Jamie Siminoff turned a simple doorbell into Ring.

The space is still wide open: tons of untapped applications in productivity, security, biohacking, and everyday automation. I'm exploring a venture-scale build here and would love a technical cofounder with hands-on experience in embedded systems, NFC/RFID integration, wearables hardware, or IoT prototyping. 🛠️

If you're a hardware engineer, hacker, or embedded dev who's excited about pushing the limits of what's possible in a tiny ring form factor, let's grab a short virtual coffee chat.☕

Happy to dive into tech constraints (e.g., passive vs active NFC, antenna design, power management), brainstorm use cases, or share my initial thinking.

DM or comment if this resonates....  .... no pressure, just exploring alignments!

I was due in at the beginning of May. I no longer have anything to look forward to this year. I only feel dread and anxiety.  My therapist told me I should put small things on the calendar, like coffee with a friend, or something so I can have SOMETHING but I don't have anything that would make me excited or happy.

Is there anything I could be doing to help me? I don't really like being with friends right now, art projects don't bring me joy, doing things with LC doesn't bring me joy (but seeing her giggling and laughing and having fun *does*) 

It's been 4 weeks. When do you get out of this slump?when did you start enjoying things again?

Use the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).
