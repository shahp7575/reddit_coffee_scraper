I‚Äôm a 38-year-old guy based in Brisbane‚Äîdown to earth, shy at first but warm once I open up. I‚Äôve got a lot of heart to give and I‚Äôm hoping to find someone who‚Äôs kind, emotionally available, and open to something real.

I‚Äôm a big fan of deep chats over coffee, meaningful connection, and those slow-burning relationships that grow stronger over time. I‚Äôm not here for a fling‚ÄîI'm genuinely looking for someone I can build a future with. I value emotional depth, mutual respect, and that spark you get when you‚Äôre with the right person.

A little about me:

I work hard and drive a lot for work, but I always make time for the people who matter.

I‚Äôve got ADHD, which means I can be a little scattered but also intensely passionate and loyal.

I‚Äôm a proud cat dad to a ragdoll who thinks he‚Äôs royalty üòÑ

I‚Äôm more of a quiet pub or night-in guy than a loud party type.

I believe in honesty, showing up, and putting in effort when someone matters.


If you‚Äôre someone who values kindness, communication, and connection‚Äîand you‚Äôre open to something that could lead to long-term‚Äîlet‚Äôs start with a message. Or even better, a coffee.

So...
If you come up Trudeau and go east along Cavell, you're limited to 40 km/h until you find a new speed limit sign. 
If you come up Lancaster and go west along Cavell, you can 'race along' at 50km/h.

Basically title, but was just wondering what works for you all who are in a long term relationship? I‚Äôm trying to figure out the best way to make a long term relationship work as someone without BPD.

We had a really great relationship, seemed like we communicated extremely well, but then we had a really small fight and she dumped me completely out of the blue, over the phone. The gist of the fight was that neither of us had planned out very well this one day where we were going to see each other. It ended up not working out because we had separate plans in the morning and evening which left us with no real time to see each other. Sucks, but it was just a lack of planning on both of our parts, which I think is easily fixable. The ‚Äúfight‚Äù happened mostly over text over a few days, and unfortunately happened to be right before a trip I was supposed to go on with her and her family, which I think added a lot of stress.

The reasons she gave for dumping me were unrelated to the small fight, and kinda felt like she was searching for reasons to justify dumping me? Like she was never shy about communicating problems or issues, and we always dealt with them right away really successfully. But then the things she mentioned as reasons for the breakup she had never communicated before, and frankly were really easy things for me to fix if I‚Äôd known. I even said as much but it seemed like she had made up her mind?

 I‚Äôve always been very willing to adapt to her needs, apologize, comfort, and I remained willing to do so even during the breakup and right after. 

I know that people don‚Äôt need some extra special good reason to break up, but she maintained that she loved me at the same time which just left me really confused, since it felt like the reasons she gave just didn‚Äôt add up? 

She‚Äôs been to tons of therapy and in general was always really self-aware and good at owning her mistakes and being empathetic and kind with my own flaws. You all would know much better than I, but the lack of concrete reasons behind the breakup makes me suspect that this was splitting?

It‚Äôs been a few months since then, and I haven‚Äôt stopped loving her. The things she mentioned as problems I fixed on my own within a couple weeks. We have run into each other a few times and have talked a little bit, and we‚Äôre gonna meet for coffee in a few days. 

&nbsp;

This is all theoretical, but how could I prevent something like that in the future, if we do get back together? I‚Äôm sort of left in this weird spot where the only big problem I ever had with our relationship was the breakup out of the blue, and I‚Äôm afraid of that happening again at some point down the line.

 Is there anything I can do from my end, or do I just have to hope and wait for her to figure things out on her own?",1,1750467056.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

# Top 10 Tips to Save Money on Groceries

1. **Pay attention to unit prices.** How much an item costs on the shelf isn‚Äôt necessarily a reflection of if it‚Äôs a good value. To know if you‚Äôre truely paying the best price for an item you need to pay attention to the unit pricing.
2. **Know your price points.** For example, in my area boneless skinless chicken breasts go on sale for $2.49/lb about once a month. I keep an eye out for my $2.49/lb or lower price point and when it‚Äôs on sale I buy enough for a few weeks until it will go on sale again.
3. **Manufacturer Coupons!** Write the manufacturers‚Äôs of your favorite name brand products and ask to be added to their mailing lists for coupons or promotions. You can find the contact information on the company‚Äôs website.
4. **Store Coupons & Rewards Programs.** Don‚Äôt underestimate how much you can save by joining your local grocery store‚Äôs rewards program, and before you go shopping make sure to check the store‚Äôs app or website for coupons.
5. **Clearance Items.** Finding items on clearance is just the luck of the draw, but you can increase your odds of finding good deals by spending a few minutes doing some detective work at your local grocery stores. Where does each department normally place the discount items? Do they have a regular time of they they mark things down? You can ask the staff working in those departments what the policy is for clearance items at that store.
6. **Membership‚Äôs & Food Service Stores.** Most people know about buying bulk through Sam‚Äôs Club, Costco or BJ‚Äôs. But did you know you can sometimes purchase bulk items from food service stores as well? Not all stores that supply restaurants will sell to the public, but some, like Gordon Food Service, do. If you have the space to store a larger amount of frozen or shelf stable items it can be worth looking into. You can search on Maps for food service companies in your area.
7. **CSA‚Äôs & local food co-ops.** CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) & local food coop‚Äôs are a great way to join with other‚Äôs in your community and benefit from bulk buying and, for CSAs, support local farmers.
8. **Local farmer‚Äôs market‚Äôs & farm stands.** Farmer‚Äôs markets & farm stands are great resources for fresh local food, but you can also reach out to the owners and ask if they are selling any produce like beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc by the half bushel, bushel, etc. for preserving.
9. **NO SINGLE STORE HAS THE BEST PRICES ALL THE TIME.** Look, I get it, shopping at multiple stores is more work, but to get your grocery bill really low you will most likely need to price compare and shop at multiple stores when possible. Particularly to take advantage of‚Ä¶.
10. **Loss Leaders!** These are the items on super sale each week. The ones that the store is probably taking a loss on just to get you in the door. The trick is to be smart about shopping loss leaders. Go with a list you‚Äôve made after comparing prices online first & stick to your list. Loss leaders are the back bone of having a frugal pantry. Stock up on items when they‚Äôre on sale. Even directing $5-$10 a week of your grocery budget to stocking up on sale items will build a frugal pantry.

# Recipes



**Breakfast Sandwiches**

1 dozen eggs  
12 slices breakfast meat of your choice  
12 slices cheese of your choice  
1 dozen English muffins  
Canning rings to help make egg circles (nice, but not necessary)

1. Cook your breakfast meat your preferred way. I find it fastest to use baking sheets in the oven to prepare sausage patties or bacon. This batch I‚Äôm using sausage patties so I will bake them at 350 on racks set on baking sheets for about 30 - 40 min or until they‚Äôre fairly well done.
2. While your breakfast meat cooks, toast & butter your English muffins.
3. Fry 12 eggs. There is no need for them to be perfectly round like store bought egg sandwiches, but‚Ä¶..
4. *Optional*: If you‚Äôd like them to be round like the English muffins you can use a metal canning ring. Spray your skillet with non stick spray if it needs  Place canning ring flat, top edge down. Allow ring to heat for a minute, spray with non stick spray, and crack your egg into the ring.  Let egg cook almost fully before carefully flipping the egg & ring and using tongs to remove the ring. ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉFinish cooking the egg to your desired level. Most pans can hold 2‚Äì4 canning rings at a time.
5. Assemble sandwiches: 1 buttered English muffin, egg, piece of meat, and slice of cheese per sandwich.
6. Wrap sandwiches in paper towel or parchment paper squares.
7. Store in a gallon baggie in the fridge for several days or up to a month in the freezer.
8. To reheat, microwave in the paper towel or paper until hot through. Time will vary depending on the strength of your microwave. From frozen, start with 3¬Ω minutes at 70% power.

4. Place dough ball between wax paper sheets & use rolling pin to roll dough out until it‚Äôs about ‚Öõ‚Äì¬º‚Äù thick and about ¬Ω‚Äù‚Äì1‚Äù wider than the circumference of your pie pan.
5. When dough is rolled to the needed size, remove top sheet of wax paper.
6. Use the bottom sheet to flip your rolled dough into your pie pan.
7. Gently press dough into pan & crimp edges.
8. Use a fork to poke holes in the bottom of the crust.

1lgjthk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lgjthk/there_was_a_spider_living_by_my_window/,There was a spider living by my window.,"I first noticed it about 7 months ago. There‚Äôs a small window above my kitchen sink, overlooking my backyard. My morning routine always includes washing my coffee mug and watching the birds chirp the morning into being, as a coffee machine produces a fresh pot. But that morning was different.  As I watched the birds flapping around aimlessly, something caught my attention through my peripheral vision - something on my side of the windowsill.

It was a tiny dot, not much bigger than a fly, squirming around a cloud of white silk. I initially thought it was a gnat - my small windowsill plant and its corresponding humidity often attracts small critters.  I neared my nose to the white cloud and saw 8 tiny legs flailing around, adding to the misty web. 

Every morning in the following weeks and months included checking in on my new spider buddy, as I washed my mug and waited for my coffee.  He (I‚Äôm not sure why I think of it as a ‚Äúhe‚Äù) usually floated on his cloud of a web, not moving.  Occasionally, I would offer a small stimulating puff of air to see if he was still alive.  He always was.

The days and weeks passed. The December chill was traded for the warm and humid May mornings. And my little friend continued to float around on his web.  I‚Äôm not a fan of spiders or anything that crawls on more than 4 legs, but as time passed, I grew to think of him as a friend. I don‚Äôt know why; there was no logic to it, I simply enjoyed seeing him every morning, getting bigger, growing as the year rolled on.

Within the first few weeks, Mr. Spider grew from gnat-sized to around the size of a pea.  His body was very round, but his legs were growing faster than his body. That‚Äôs not unusual, I think?  His size capped off with his body being about the size of a marble, but his long legs made him a bit intimidating. His size made me a bit uncomfortable, but I told myself I was being dramatic.  I know it sounds stupid, but I thought of him as a friend. 

One morning, I noticed he wasn‚Äôt on his web. He was on the windowsill, his body drooping down with his legs making sharp upside down V‚Äôs. I nudged him with a dead leaf that lay beside him, and he crawled slowly away.  He looked lethargic. I figured maybe he was nearing the end of his life. I don‚Äôt have the first idea how long spiders live. But it occured to me that maybe he was hungry.  I went outside, directly in front of the windowsill, scooped up a few ants and placed them on his web.  In an instant, he climbed back up his web towards his prey.  I left him to it.

So far, it‚Äôs all fine and dandy, but here is where things get weird. 

I made this part of my daily routine - I would go outside and pick up a few ants for him to eat. I set out sticky fly traps and began feeding him flies and other small critters that were unfortunate enough to stick to their death.

And the spider began to grow. And grow. And grow. And it didn‚Äôt stop growing.  

It made me slightly uncomfortable, but I know how big tarantulas can get, and he wasn‚Äôt there yet, so I kept feeding him. He usually slept in the mornings, curled up in a tight ball, tucking in his legs at the corner of his web.  I would place his food on his web and would go on about my day.  I didn‚Äôt see him move for a long time, but seeing that the food was always gone in the morning, he was eating a lot. 

Then suddenly, he was gone.  He no longer was on the windowsill for months, and I assumed he was living in the neighboring plant, though deep down I knew he was much too big for that. Maybe he had moved on the larger plants in my living room, I thought.  

It wasn‚Äôt until 3 days ago that I began to panic.  

I entered my kitchen like I had every single morning since I first saw him, and noticed something in the corner of my eye.  Along the edge of the room, near the door to my backyard, I saw a small melon-sized sphere, curled up in a familiar pose.  

I instantly knew what it was, but my brain couldn‚Äôt digest it. It couldn‚Äôt be.  It must have known I was looking at it (I could no longer think of it as a he) because it slowly uncoiled its enormous legs and began walking across my kitchen.  Each leg was over a foot long, folded perfectly for quick movement and stability. Its eyes were bulging and visible for the first time. Its movement startled me (that‚Äôs an understatement), causing me to recoil back and knock down a cup.  In return, my quick movement and clashing noise frightened him.

In less than 3 seconds. It jumped 4 feet high onto my wall, climbed directly up, and went inside my AC vent, squeezing tightly to get through.

That evening, a dead mouse appeared at the foot of my bed. It was wrapped in a small silky pouch. Last night, another ‚Äúgift‚Äù appeared. Something bigger and furrier; I think it‚Äôs a dead squirrel - I don't know, and I don't care.

I‚Äôm now unsure how to proceed.  

It lives in my air condition vents/ducts.  At night, I hear it crawling outside my bedroom, each leg causing a small tapping sound on my hardwood floor. Throughout the day, I feel like I am constantly being watched.  

Clearly it thinks of me as a friend. But what happens when that changes? What happens when it develops an appetite for something bigger, and it approaches me while I sleep?

A (weird and stupid) side of me has grown fond of it - almost considering it like a roommate.  But on the other hand, Clearly this is a mutated animal. Spiders don‚Äôt grow that size, and if push comes to shove, I do not want him around if things go south.  Is it venomous? Does that even matter, seeing that it can probably kill me without much effort.  It‚Äôs too quick for me to catch, and even if I try, I don‚Äôt want to anger it.

1lgjs2g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lgjs2g,Ninja CM401 Power Board Failure after overvoltage,"

Hello! I recently had a power surge that fried my coffee maker. We love it so I figured I'd open it up. I found a fried MOV (10D271K) that I replaced and I tested the Film Capacitor (MPX275VacX2) and Power Relay (SRG-S-112DM-F) near by and they are working.

I tried tracing the circuit and got as far as the bridge rectifier (DB107S) where the readings were .500 V from NEG to AC1, NEG to AC2, and NEG to POS. I thought NEG to POS should have been 1V but some folks on other forums said that might be a limit of my multimeter (Extech MN36).

I tested that 5VDC is not reaching the pin out that feeds to the main board which I suspect is the problem but am stuck and how to continue tracing this.

I also tested the main control board by supplying it with 5VDC but the on button did nothing. I suspect this is expected given the board is on its own without anything connected but I would love to verify this without having to assemble the whole thing once I figure out the power board.

I ordered a replacement control board just in case but couldn't find a power board so I need to hunt and peck but I'd prefer to have a bit more direction!

At first, it significantly enhanced my productivity and made me focus a lot, so I really liked it. Now, it seems like it doesn't have such a noticeable effect anymore. I am sure I am also drinking way beyond the recommended amount, like probably over 400mg, and even that doesn't do anything at all. 

So, because it lost its effect, I am considering quitting and potentially finding other non-dependent/non-temporary ways for productivity. But at the same time, I really do not know the extent to which that is helpful. I could probably compound the amount of caffeine I consume-based on my toleration-- to produce a similar effect as before. Yet, that really doesn't result in improved productivity but rather increased anxiety. I already sort of have a problem with anxiety that I am greatly managing to the point where I think I will be able to get rid of it altogether soon. But I think my increased consumption of coffee might be contributing to that at this point, so that is another reason why I want to quit. And sleep too. But every time I forget to drink coffee, I literally feel depressed for the day, aside from intense headaches. I think it is something I can easily pull off, though, because it is just coffee after all and I dont think it is a ""real"" drug.

But at the same time, I really don't want my productivity/focus to be worse post doing so. But I recently read a study about how long-term coffee consumption reduces productivity.

I‚Äôm a 26-year-old woman, and I‚Äôve fallen deeply, unexpectedly, and kind of hopelessly in love with a woman 15 years older than me. She‚Äôs my roommate ‚Äî and probably the safest person I‚Äôve ever known. And I don‚Äôt know what to do with all these feelings.

We‚Äôve been living together since last December. I moved in after getting out of an emotionally abusive relationship. I was lost, raw, and honestly just trying to survive. She offered me a room in her home, and from day one, it felt like the first real breath I‚Äôd taken in years. She made me feel safe ‚Äî not just physically, but emotionally. And that‚Äôs where everything started to shift.

I think I‚Äôve always been drawn to older women. Even when I was a teenager, I felt something deeper than admiration for women who carried themselves with confidence, who had a sense of calm about them. Teachers, mentors, characters in books and movies ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt understand it then, but looking back, it was always there. That attraction. That pull.

And now here I am, living with this woman who embodies everything I‚Äôve ever wanted but never let myself want. She‚Äôs beautiful in the way that takes your breath away ‚Äî not just because of how she looks, but because of how she is. She‚Äôs nurturing without being overbearing. Playful but grounded. She makes coffee in the morning and starts her day early in a good mood, and I just sit there pretending to read while my heart‚Äôs doing somersaults.

There‚Äôs tension between us. Real, electric tension. The kind that builds in the silence, in the too-long eye contact, in the way our hands brush a little too often when passing things to each other. We have these late-night conversations where we get too honest, too close ‚Äî and I‚Äôll catch her looking at my lips, and I know she‚Äôs feeling something too. But we never cross that line. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs holding back for the same reasons I am ‚Äî fear of ruining the friendship, the living situation, the safety we‚Äôve built. Or maybe she‚Äôs just being kind, and I‚Äôm reading too much into all of it. But my body knows and most of all my heart knows. When she sits too close on the couch, when she laughs and touches my arm, when she looks at me like she‚Äôs searching for something ‚Äî I feel like I‚Äôm already hers, even if nothing‚Äôs happened.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to make a move and lose her, but I also don‚Äôt know how much longer I can pretend I don‚Äôt feel what I feel. All I know is that I‚Äôve never wanted someone like this before ‚Äî fully, wholly, painfully. And if she ever kissed me, I think I‚Äôd break open in the best way.

Im at such a crossroads in my life right now. Even if nobody comments, I‚Äôm just happy to have typed this out.

I am dating the sweetest, pretty, easy going, kind hearted woman I‚Äôve ever met.

We have been together for 3 years, living together for 2. She loves my family and I love hers and our friends have meshed well. She is so kind and I love her, but i dont think I‚Äôm IN love with her anymore.. if that makes sense. We always have a great time with a ton of laughs when we go on date nights or travel but sometimes I feel like we‚Äôre not very compatible. Most of my compatibility concern is related to sex. 

I‚Äôm the first person she‚Äôs ever slept with. Most men would consider that a good thing however it‚Äôs driving me insane. She loves love and so do I, but sometimes I just want a disgusting nasty fuck and she cant fulfill that for me. She doesn‚Äôt know any other type of sex besides the passionate kind. I no longer watch porn, however I did frequently when I was younger and this innevitably gave me an alternative lense on sex. She has never watched porn. I‚Äôve proposed watching porn together so that she can get an idea of different flavors of sex but she doesn‚Äôt like it, it makes her feel weird. That ship has sailed I guess‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not gonna force her to watch porn lol. I‚Äôve spoken to her about kinks that turn me on and when I‚Äôve asked her about hers, she says ‚ÄúI dont have any‚Äù. We‚Äôve done the things that I like, but I know she doesn‚Äôt exactly love it, so it kind of takes away the excitement away from it all. She also doesn‚Äôt ever perform oral sex on me. I‚Äôve spoken to her about it and she‚Äôs afraid to do so because she occasionally will get a cold sore on her lip and doesn‚Äôt want me to contract that on my penis. Understandable. However, she has no problem with intensely making out with me and then moments later me going down on her. I know someone will probably comment ‚Äúwhy do you go down on her if she doesn‚Äôt go down on you?‚Äù. Because I love doing it lol. FUCK.

The other big piece to this is that she‚Äôs also extremely unmotivated to do anything to further herself. I‚Äôve had success in the last year or two of my professional life so her income doesn‚Äôt really matter, but applying herself at NOTHING is a real turn off. I‚Äôve told her that I dont care if she invests her time in learning to play the fucking viola.. Just please do SOMETHING. She‚Äôs currently a bartender and makes great money but that isn‚Äôt the point.. She does go to pilates twice a week, but I know it‚Äôs just so that she can say that she did something to ‚Äúbetter herself‚Äù, she doesn‚Äôt actually want to be there. Same when she hits the gym. She goes to work, goes on coffee dates with her mom, runs to target and thats it.. She doesn‚Äôt devote any time to any kind of accomplishment. Maybe i sound like a shallow asshole, but that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm feeling and I‚Äôm pretty fed up with it. A complete lack of drive is a turn off for me.

I know the obvious answer is to just break it off, but I feel in my gut that I‚Äôm going to end it with her and then in a year regret the hell out of it.

Front and back yard. (Front is semi-gated and Back is gated.)

Back yard is set up with outdoor seating.

Avocado tree that will start putting out avocados around Sept.

Washer and Dryer inside the house.

Mini split AC/Heat units in every room. We hardly use them so if you use them a lot that will push the electric bill up.

I've been thinking a lot lately about how we often get caught up in the numbers game when it comes to retirement planning. You know, obsessing over that magical net worth figure or trying to hit specific savings targets. But here's the thing - I've realized that true financial wellness isn't just about the numbers; it's about creating a life that makes us happy, both now and in the future.

Let me share something that changed my perspective. Last year, I was religiously tracking every penny and feeling guilty about spending on anything ""unnecessary."" Then one day, while skipping a coffee meetup with an old friend to save $5, it hit me - I was sacrificing genuine happiness for minimal financial gain.

This revelation led me to completely overhaul my approach to retirement planning. Now, I start by listing what truly brings me joy - whether it's traveling, pursuing hobbies, or spending time with family - and build my budget around these priorities. Using retirement planning tools helps me ensure I'm still on track while allowing room for these important aspects of life.

One game-changer was breaking free from negative money self-talk. Instead of beating myself up about past financial mistakes, I started celebrating small wins - like staying within my grocery budget or making an extra contribution to my retirement account. It's amazing how this shift in mindset affects both your financial decisions and overall happiness.

Speaking of happiness, I've found that incorporating proven happiness-boosting practices into daily life makes a huge difference. Simple things like expressing gratitude for what you have, finding moments of awe in nature, or maintaining strong social connections can significantly impact your well-being without costing much (or anything at all).

Here's a practical tip that's worked wonders for me: Before making any significant purchase, I ask myself, ""Will this contribute to my long-term happiness?"" This simple question has helped me make better spending decisions and ensure my money aligns with what truly matters to me.

Something else I've learned to avoid is the comparison trap. It's so easy to scroll through social media and feel behind when you see others posting about their investment gains or early retirement plans. Remember, everyone's financial journey is unique, and what works for others might not work for you.

I've found that the most satisfying approach to retirement planning is one that balances future security with present enjoyment. For example, I allocate a portion of my budget to ""happiness spending"" - activities or purchases that genuinely enhance my life - while still maintaining healthy savings habits.

What about you? How do you balance planning for the future while enjoying the present? Have you found any specific practices that help you maintain both financial and emotional well-being? I'd love to hear your strategies and experiences in the comments below!

Remember, we're all in this journey together, and sometimes the best insights come from sharing our collective wisdom. Let's make retirement planning less about stress and more about creating a life we love, both now and in the future.",1,1750465100.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

I missed out on socializing, romance, a sex life, all because my breath reeked. One of my earliest memories was being in kindergarten and a girl telling me: your breath stinks.

She wasn't lying. Even since I can remember I have had stinky breath. It smelled like rotten eggs, sulfur, an open drain, sewage. People would ask who farted when I was in the vicinity, people would cover their noses while talking to me. It was so humiliating.

I tried everything in the book and then some: visiting the dentist 10+ times a year and OCD levels of dental hygiene, buying hundreds of different mouthwashes and treatments from dozens of different countries. Tried every probiotic on the market. Went vegan, paleo, you name it. Tongue scraping, washing with a waterpick. Drank a gallon of water a day. Had a tonsillectomy and was on meds for 10+ years for GERD, got surgery to fix a hiatal hernia in case thats what was causing it. Very little helped. To be honest, I was suicidal.

Then recently I did a genetic test and found out that I have two pretty major amino acid disorders: hypermethionemia and homocystinuria. Basically, raised levels of methionine and cysteine in the blood, that are then expelled through the breath. For those who don't know, both methionine and cysteine have a very distinctive, rotten egg, sulfur type smell. I noticed my breath would get so much worse after drinking milk, eating meat, or consuming high protein foods like legumes. My mouth smelled like boiled cabbage after drinking a coffee. 

This first became flagged when I went for a simple urine test at the doctor and they told me that although there was no infection, I was showing unusually large amounts of protein in my urine. There was no follow-up for this and I was never offered further investigation. I decided to be my own advocate and paid for genetic testing.

Now I'm finally doing the right lifestyle as well as being given treatment: avoiding all high protein foods, as well as megadosing b vitamins. I am hoping to try a couple of medications soon and see if that will help even more. My bad breath is 90% gone. It still smells bad if I eat any kind of food with protein which to be honest is kind of hard to avoid. Basically a fruitarian/low protein vegetarian diet is all I can really do, coupled with intermittent fasting.

  
I can't say if your situation and diagnosis will be the same as mine, but I would just like to share this as I had no idea all these years that I had a metabolic disorder all along. If this helps even one person, I will be glad.

TL;DR: bad breath was caused by two amino acid metabolic disorders that I was only diagnosed with this year.",1,1750464397.0,badbreath,4,1.0,False

Teaching Italian is like navigating a winding road; you never know what twists await! I remember introducing *servire* to my students. Their faces were a mix of confusion and curiosity. Just when they thought they had Italian verbs figured out, along came *servire* with its unique structure. 

**The art of needing in Italian**

In English, saying ""I need a pizza"" is straightforward. But in Italian, it's a different ballgame. Picture this: the pizza becomes the star of the sentence, and you're just a supporting actor. *Mi serve una pizza* translates to ""A pizza is needed by me."" Mind-boggling, right?

**Indirect pronouns: Your new best friends**

To master *servire*, you need to buddy up with indirect pronouns. Here's a quick list to keep handy:

- *mi* / *a me* (to me)
- *ti* / *a te* (to you)
- *gli* / *a lui* (to him)
- *le* / *a lei* (to her)
- *ci* / *a noi* (to us)
- *vi* / *a voi* (to you all)
- *gli* / *a loro* (to them)

**A slice of life**

Imagine you're in a bustling Italian restaurant. The waiter approaches, and you confidently say, *Mi serve un caff√®.* You're not just ordering coffee; you're embracing the Italian way of expressing needs!

**Conjugation: The final piece of the puzzle**

Conjugating *servire* is like choosing the right tool for the job. Whether it's *serve* for one or *servono* for many, getting it right is key. Think of it as finding the perfect fit, like Cinderella's slipper.

**Your turn to share!**

We pay $3.5K + Electric and Gas. I also have a small hatchback car I would be willing to rent. Main thing is, we have a really good relationship with our landlord which is why we have such great rent for the area, so we want someone who is no-fuss and won't create issues. You can reach out directly to us if anything goes wrong at the house while we're gone and we can handle it. We're open to talking to people who are going to be good tenants but can't afford our full rent so it's not sitting empty if it comes to that. 

Our dates are flexible right now, so we'd be willing to entertain people who are interested in 2 months, 3 months, or even 4 or 5 months. 

Here are some details about our space:

Front and back yard. (Front is semi-gated and Back is gated.)

Shared driveway with parking for 1. There is always street parking in this area as well.

Back yard is set up with outdoor seating. 

Avocado tree that will start putting out avocados around Sept.

We have a projector in the living room that we use as a TV.

We have no TVs in the bedrooms so if you wanted one you'd have to buy it. 

Washer and Dryer inside the house.

Mini split AC/Heat units in every room. We hardly use them so if you use them a lot that will push the electric bill up. 

Right down the street from soft-bottom section of the LA river where there are parks, restaurants, coffee shops, and a walking/bike path. This section of the river has continuous water flowing with permanent trees, foliage, and grasses growing from the middle of the river. Supposedly the best bird watching in LA.

We can never go to a restaurant for too long. If we're at a family gathering, he's either pouring water from a glass on the ground, throwing some things around, or screaming to get a mobile or something dangerous he wants to play with,

He cries over wanting to drive and sit in the driver seat (I admit my wife's brother let's him sit in their car and play around while they watch him when my wife visits her family)

I don't know, sometimes I feel like I messed up in raising him, I love him, we love him,

But changing a diaper is a fight, changing a shirt is a fight, asking him to get off the laptop is a fight

I think he's very smart as well, he quickly catches up on stuff we do, and then repeats immediately,  so laptops, phones, driving, making coffee, pouring water, turning on the lights, turning on the stove, are all things he wants to do that we need to watch for him as well,

They wouldn't live long enough to regret it.

Blair woke to pain.
It wasn't a sharp pain‚Äîit was the dull, spreading kind, like every bone in her body was bruised and every inch of skin stretched too tight. Her eyes blinked open slowly, adjusting to the faint gray light leaking through the cracked window. Dust floated in the air, swirling like ghosts in the silence of the kitchen.
She tried to move, but her legs ached, and her right arm wouldn't bend properly. Her lip was swollen, and when she licked it, she tasted blood‚Äîdry and cracked. The floor beneath her was cold tile, and the thin, tattered shirt she wore did nothing to keep the chill out.
Her ribs ached with every breath.
Madam hadn't let her sleep in the tiny mattress in the closet last night. She'd fallen asleep on the kitchen floor, her back stinging from fresh belt marks, her mind fuzzy and slow. She didn't know what time it was. There was no clock, and the days all blurred together.
But one thing was certain: it was time to make breakfast.
Blair pulled herself up with trembling hands, trying not to cry out. Crying made her feel weak‚Äîand worse, it made them angry. She couldn't afford that today. Not again, not so soon.
She dragged herself to the stove. The iron skillet was already on the burner. Madam always left it out, as if daring her to fail.
Blair stood on her toes to reach the pan, her bare feet aching on the cold tile. She turned the knob, watching the blue flame catch and dance beneath the metal. It hissed, too loud in the silence. She winced. Every sound in this house could be a mistake.
She pulled the eggs from the counter. Her fingers were shaking again.
Please don't drop them, she begged herself silently, please just do it right.
She cracked the first egg, but the shell crumbled in her hand, sharp edges slicing her thumb. Blood mixed with yolk. She wiped it quickly on her shirt, hoping they wouldn't notice. She poured it into the pan, but the butter sizzled too fast, the egg bubbling at the edges, curling too soon.
The second egg didn't fare much better. She flipped them too early, too scared of overcooking, and the yolks broke, bleeding yellow across the pan.
The smell hit her next‚Äîburnt and bitter.
Her chest tightened. It was too late.
Footsteps. Two pairs.
She didn't have to look to know who it was.
""Again,"" Madam hissed, her voice like a razor blade. ""What did we say about burning our food, little freak m?""
Blair turned, holding out the pan with shaking hands. ""I‚ÄîI tried‚Äî""
""You tried?"" Sir's voice was deep and low, coated in mockery. ""You tried.""
He strode toward her, taller than the doorframe, his face shadowed by the dull overhead light. Blair stepped back, but not fast enough. His hand shot out and grabbed her by the hair, twisting the strands until her scalp screamed. The pan clattered to the floor.
She whimpered as he dragged her through the house, her heels scraping against the linoleum, then the rough carpet. He threw her down in the middle of the living room.
Madam was already there, arms crossed, smirking. ""You want to act like a dog?"" she sneered. ""Then get treated like one.""
The first kick took her by surprise. Her lungs seized. She gasped.
The second landed in her ribs, sharp and deep. The pain radiated up her spine.
Blair tried to curl up, to make herself smaller, less of a target. Her arms covered her face. That's what they told her to do in the books she used to read‚Äîcover your head. Protect the soft parts.
But they never said what to do when there was no one to stop it.
""Stupid little brat,"" Sir growled as he undid his belt. ""Can't cook, can't clean, can't do a thing right.""
Crack.
The first lash of leather lit fire across her back. She bit her lip so hard it tore.
Crack.
Another across her shoulder. The skin split open‚Äîshe felt it. Her shirt clung to the blood now leaking out of her.
Crack.
Her vision blurred. Her body trembled violently.
And still, Madam laughed.
""Look at her. Bleeding already? She's not even trying anymore.""
""She'll pass out before we finish,"" Sir grunted.
Blair couldn't tell if the tears were from pain or fury, maybe both, but she didn't dare cry aloud.
Sir kicked her one last time, and she collapsed completely, her vision going black at the edges. Her breath hitched in shallow gasps. Blood from her mouth mixed with the blood on the floor.
And then came the sound of footsteps... retreating.
""You know what?"" Madam's voice rang out behind her. ""I'm sick of her. She's more trouble than she's worth.""
""She'll be dead soon anyway,"" Sir replied casually. ""Let's go. I want to be gone before sundown.""
They didn't even close the door gently when they left.
It slammed, shaking the frame.
And then...
Silence.
Only the sound of Blair's weak, broken breathing remained.
She lay on the cold carpet, barely conscious, her body twisted and trembling. The floor smelled like dust and blood.
Her eyes fluttered.
But she didn't cry.
She didn't scream. She just lay there waiting for whatever.
Then after a while, the world went black.
 
A call came in around 7:32 a.m.
An older woman on the next street over reported loud banging and screams from the rundown house on the corner of Sycamore Lane. It wasn't the first complaint‚Äîthere had been others over the years‚Äîbut nothing ever came of it. Just shouting, slamming doors, and a couple of trash fires out back. No one had ever seen a child. No one had ever stayed long enough to look too closely to find anything.
But this morning, something felt different. The air was heavy, the sky bruised with clouds, and the voice on the phone was shaking.
So, Officers Daniels and Ruiz were dispatched for a wellness check.
They pulled up to the house at 7:54.
The place looked abandoned. The yard was overgrown. Paint peeled from the siding like it was trying to run away. One of the shutters hung crooked. The mailbox was stuffed with old flyers and bills, damp from last week's rain.
Daniels knocked on the front door, no answer, Ruiz rang the bell. Nothing.
They tried again. A second knock. Harder this time.
Silence.
Ruiz glanced through a dirt-smeared window and turned to Daniels, frowning. ""We've got a warrant. Let's go in.""
Daniels nodded once and stepped back. With a swift motion, he kicked the door near the handle. The frame cracked with a loud bang, and the door swung open.
Inside, the air was thick with the smell of rot, mold, and something metallic.
The officers stepped carefully through the hallway. Empty beer bottles lined the kitchen counters. Piles of unwashed clothes and garbage cluttered the floor. One wall had deep scratch marks, like someone had clawed at the plaster.
Then came a voice.
""Over here!""
Daniels had pushed open the living room door‚Äîand stopped in his tracks.
Ruiz rushed in beside him. ""Oh my God.""
There, on the filthy carpet, lay a girl‚Äîmotionless.
She looked no older than eight at first glance, though she was really twelve, just starved down to bone. Her body was curled in on itself, her skin as pale as paper, littered with bruises. Dried blood pooled around her, dark and sticky. Her hair was matted, her lips were cracked, her arms and legs were marked with fading bruises, fresh gashes, and purple welts that hadn't yet scabbed.
Daniels dropped to his knees beside her and pressed two fingers to her neck.
""She's alive!"" he called, urgency rising in his voice. ""Pulse is weak, get a ambulance now!""
Ruiz radioed it in as Daniels gently turned the girl on her side, trying not to hurt her more. She stirred faintly, a weak sound escaping her lips‚Äîtoo soft to understand. Her eyelids fluttered. Then her body went still again.
Daniels kept his hand on her shoulder and murmured, ""It's okay. You're safe now.""
‚∏ª
When Blair woke again, everything felt wrong.
The air was clean. The silence was soft, not sharp. She wasn't on the floor.
Her lashes fluttered open slowly, her vision blurry from the glare of the ceiling light. The room around her was bright‚Äîwhite walls, white sheets, white curtains pulled halfway across the window. The sunlight outside was pale and gentle, not harsh like she was used to.
She blinked again, confused. The bed beneath her was soft. Her body didn't move easily‚Äîit ached everywhere, like fire under her skin‚Äîbut she could breathe.
She was wearing a hospital gown, thin and cotton. Her arms had IVs taped gently down to her skin. Bandages wrapped her wrists, her upper arms, even her ribcage. She felt the stiff tug of medical tape along her back. Her hands were bruised but clean.
A plastic band wrapped her wrist with a name she hadn't seen in years.
Blair Carter.
Her throat was dry. She tried to speak, but only a breath came out. Her eyes darted around the room.
Where was the stove?
Where was the smell of burning?
Where was Sir?
Where was Madam?
Suddenly, the door creaked open.
A nurse walked in first‚Äîmiddle-aged, kind eyes, gray streaks in her curly black hair. She was followed by a tall man in a white coat, holding a clipboard and smiling warmly.
""Ah, you're awake,"" the doctor said softly, his voice calm and gentle. ""How do you feel?""
Blair stared at him, heart racing.
She didn't know who he was. She didn't know where she was. Everything was clean and white and quiet, and that was wrong.
She tried to speak, but it came out a croak.
Taking a breath, she forced the words out with all the courage her tiny body could find.
""Where... am I?""
The nurse stepped forward and passed her a glass of water, Blair looked at it and took it slowly. Not knowing what to do, but she drank it.
The doctor stepped closer but moved slowly, like he didn't want to scare her. ""You're in the hospital, Blair, you were hurt, but the police found you and brought you here. You're safe now.""
Blair's mouth trembled.
Police?
Her mind couldn't catch up. It still felt like yesterday, like she was standing by the stove again, burning eggs and waiting for punishment.
""Where is... Sir?"" she whispered. ""And... Madam?""
The nurse and the doctor exchanged a glance. The smile on the doctor's face faded slightly, replaced with a soft frown.
""Who?"" he asked gently.
Blair blinked. Her chest tightened.
""Sir,"" she said, louder now. ""And Madam. I‚ÄîI didn't finish cooking. I wasn't supposed to leave the house. Please...""
Her voice cracked. Panic crept in like a shadow. She could hear the rules again‚ÄîNo talking. No outside. No visitors. No mistakes.
She flinched backward, tears welling up.
The doctor stepped back, raising his hands in a calming gesture. ""Whoa, whoa. It's okay. You're safe. We're going to help you."" He looked to the nurse. ""Let's get her something for the pain.""
The nurse moved quickly, adjusting the IV. Within seconds, Blair felt a cool sensation in her arm, and her body began to soften under the sedative.
Just before her eyes closed, the door opened again.
Two new figures entered the room.
One was a man in a dark jacket with a badge clipped to his belt. Introducing himself as Detective Howard.
Beside him was a woman with a soft smile, wearing a white blouse tucked into a pair of neat blue jeans. She wore wire-rimmed glasses and carried a notebook. Her voice was light, gentle.
""Hello, Blair,"" she said, stepping to the side of her bed. ""My name is Anna. I'm your social worker. How are you feeling today?""
Blair blinked slowly, still drugged with painkillers, her body limp and heavy. Her voice came out barely above a whisper.
""Good,"" she lied, because that's what she was supposed to say.
Anna smiled but looked concerned. ""I know this is all very confusing, but you're going to be okay. You were very brave. The police found you this morning and brought you here. You're safe now, don't worry. I'm going to help you.""
Blair stared at her. None of it made sense.
She looked around the room at the strangers, her heart beating faster again. Her throat clenched.
""Where is... Sir and Madam?"" she asked once more, her voice rising with fear. ""I'm not supposed to be here. Please‚Äîplease don't tell them. I didn't mean to be bad‚ÄîI didn't mean to leave, please‚Äî""
Her words broke into sobs, stuttering, choking.
Anna stepped forward, reaching out, but not touching. ""Blair, it's okay. You didn't do anything wrong.""
""Please,"" Blair whispered, eyes wide. ""Please don't let them find me.""
The doctor quickly adjusted her IV again. ""We need to let her rest.""
Anna and the detective stepped back. The sedative pulled at Blair like a tide.
Her vision blurred. The world around her softened. Her body sank deeper into the sheets.
The last thing she saw was the white light above her... and then, everything went black.
 
Anna sat alone in her office,
The late afternoon sun casting pale slashes of light across the disorganized desk in front of her. Papers were everywhere, child welfare reports, missing person files, hospital intakes and right in the center of it all... Blair.
Her hand was tangled in her hair, her fingers clutching the roots at her scalp, trying to relieve the pressure pounding at the front of her head. It wasn't just another case, not this time, not for this girl.
She'd seen bruises before. She'd seen the scars trauma left behind, but Blair was different. There was something in her eyes‚Äîhollow and watchful, like a creature that had lived its whole life in the dark and was suddenly being forced into the light.
Anna had been working for hours, digging, pulling threads. Running through every child database and foster care list she had access to.
And still‚Äînothing.
Not a birth certificate.
Not a school registration.
No medical history, no record of the name Blair Carter even being assigned at birth.
Just a ghost. She sighed deeply, how could this be possible?.
She pushed her chair back with a frustrated breath and stood. Her legs ached. Her mouth was dry. She needed coffee before she could dig any deeper.
She crossed her office floor, a cluttered space filled with case folders and old cardboard boxes with long-forgotten labels. A tired little ficus drooped in the corner. The air smelled faintly of old books, printer ink, and stress.
As she reached the small table where her coffee pot sat, her eyes landed on a box shoved partially beneath it. The cardboard was dusty, worn soft with time. She almost ignored it... until she saw the label written in her own handwriting:
AUCLAIR ‚Äì CLOSED FILES ‚Äì 2016
Anna froze.
Her heart skipped once.
The Auclair case.
A child stolen from a garden party‚Äîripped from her family at age three. Blair Auclair. Vanished without a trace. The most infamous unsolved child abduction in history. She remembered the mother, Marie, trembling and feverish with grief. The father, Rafello, stoic but broken.
And Arthur... the eldest brother. Twenty-one at the time. Cold, unforgiving, ruthless. The man who had made a name for himself not only in family circles but across New York's most powerful elite‚Äîwealthy, untouchable, and, according to rumor, lethal if crossed.
Anna slowly pulled the box toward her and opened the lid. Inside were faded photographs, typed reports, grainy security footage stills.
And then she saw the face.
Three years old. Big brown eyes. Small hands holding a pink elephant plushie.
Blair Auclair.
She felt her stomach drop.
Because the girl in the picture... had the same eyes.
Same slope of the nose. Same shape of the chin. Older now, thinner‚Äîstarved, even‚Äîbut unmistakable. Blair wasn't just any child.
She was that child.
Anna's breath caught in her throat. She set her coffee aside, grabbed her phone, and quickly made arrangements.
A DNA test. Just to be sure.
She knew Blair's hair would work. And both parents‚ÄîMarie and Rafello‚Äîhad their DNA already on record from the investigation years ago. All she had to do was collect a sample from Blair, take it to the Genetic Identification and Profiling Lab downstairs, and wait.
And if it came back negative?
Anna would adopt the girl herself. She already knew that.
‚∏ª
Hospital floors always smelled too clean.
Anna walked down the hallway with a small bundle of paperwork clutched in one hand and a police escort behind her‚ÄîDetective Howard. She could hear her heels click against the linoleum and her heart beating in her ears. She hadn't slept in twenty-four hours, but that didn't matter.
When she reached Room 304, she paused.
Blair lay on the bed, small and pale under the white sheets. Her hair was brushed now. Her arms still bore the faded shadows of old bruises. Her chest rose and fell in slow, sleepy rhythm.
Anna stepped in gently and approached the bed.
""Hi, sweetheart,"" she said softly. ""Do you remember me? I'm Anna. I'm your social worker. I was here yesterday.""
Blair blinked slowly, eyelids fluttering like butterfly wings. Her eyes landed on Anna, but there was no recognition‚Äîonly quiet fear.
""I just wanted to talk to you a little, okay?"" Anna said gently. ""You don't have to say anything. I'll explain everything.""
Blair sat up a little, but her eyes darted to the door, the IV, the machines‚Äîscanning for exits.
""I work with the people helping you,"" Anna continued. ""You're not in trouble. You didn't do anything wrong. The police found you in that house, and we brought you here to take care of you.""
But Blair's breathing changed.
She shifted in the bed. Her hands gripped the blanket. The beeping on the heart monitor began to spike.
Anna tried to calm her. ""It's okay. Really. You're not going back there.""
But Blair panicked. Her voice broke. ""No‚Äîno, please‚ÄîMadam will come‚ÄîSir will come‚Äîthey said no hospitals‚Äîplease‚Äî""
The monitor beeped louder.
The door flew open.
The doctor rushed in, injecting something into Blair's IV as the nurse held her still. ""Sedative,"" the doctor muttered. ""Her system can't handle this stress yet.""
Blair's breathing slowed. Her body sank back into the pillows, eyelids drooping.
Before leaving, Anna stepped forward, gently taking some hair stands that had fallen in her pillow.
""I'll be right back,"" she whispered.
‚∏ª
The lab smelled sterile and metallic. Bright lights buzzed overhead, and the glass walls were clean enough to see through.
Anna handed over the evidence bag with Blair's hair strands and filled out the paperwork.
""Test this against DNA profiles for Marie Auclair and Rafello Auclair,"" she said. ""This is urgent. Their records should already be in the system.""
The technician nodded and scanned the form. ""We'll rush it, you'll have results in about two hours.""
Anna nodded, her heart still racing.
She left the lab and returned to her office, unable to focus on anything else. She sat at her desk, looking again at the photo of the little girl from the old file... and the one from the hospital.
Please, she thought, please let it be her.
‚∏ª
Two hours later, her phone rang.
The voice on the other end was calm. ""The results are in.""
Anna's legs shook as she walked back into the lab. The technician handed her the printout.
One number leapt off the page:
99% probability of parental match.
Marie and Rafello Auclair are the biological parents of the child registered as Blair Carter.
Anna's breath caught in her throat. She sat down heavily in the nearest chair. Her hands were trembling.
Blair Carter is Blair Auclair.
She was alive. The little girl the world had mourned. The child whose name had faded into whispers and newspaper clippings.
But now came the hardest part.
Calling the Auclairs.
No‚Äîcalling Arthur. Since the parents had already passed, she had no choice but to call him.
The eldest, the protector, the one who had never stopped looking, even after the others had given up hope.
Anna returned to her office, the DNA results still warm in her hand. She sat down, staring at the number she'd pulled from the old file.
Arthur Auclair.
Even the name felt heavy.
Untouchable, rumored to have built an empire of secrets, power, and retribution. The kind of man who could tear the world apart with a phone call.
Anna swallowed, hands damp with sweat. Her finger hovered over the phone's keypad.
Then she took a deep breath... and dialed.
The line rang once.
Twice.
A third time.
And then‚Äî
A voice. Low. Measured.
""Arthur Auclair.""
Anna closed her eyes, heart pounding.
""Mr. Auclair... this is Anna, I am a social worker. I believe I've found your sister.""
 
The heavy oak door of the Auclair estate,
Closed with a soft click behind Arthur as he stepped inside. The moment the scent of pinewood and leather drifted up to meet him, he let out a deep, bone-weary sigh. The time was 5:30 p.m., and the weight of the day settled in his shoulders like lead.
He loosened his tie with one hand, his fingers moving with mechanical precision. His other hand dragged through his hair as he walked into the grand living room‚Äîdimly lit by the golden glow of early evening spilling through tall windows. Ornate molding lined the ceiling, and a black marble fireplace remained cold and unlit.
On the velvet couch, side by side, sat his youngest brothers‚ÄîAdrien and Andr√©, both 19, both glued to their consoles. The flickering light from the TV danced across their focused faces, their matching dark hair slightly mussed from the heat of the game.
They barely glanced at him.
Adrien, eyes still on the screen, lifted a hand. ""Hey, Arthur.""
Andr√© added lazily, ""Welcome home,"" his thumb jamming the controller.
Arthur stood there a moment, one brow arching with mild disapproval. ""Dinner in thirty. Clean up before you sit at the table.""
""Yes, sir,"" they said in unison, joking, still not looking at him.
With a tired grunt and an eye roll, Arthur turned and made his way upstairs. His room‚Äîat the far end of the hallway‚Äîwas sleek, minimalist, and spotless. Shades of obsidian, silver, and navy dominated the space, and the only sign of humanity was the half-empty glass of whiskey on his desk.
He peeled off his suit jacket, hanging it carefully. Just as he began unbuttoning his dress shirt, his phone buzzed from the dresser.
An unknown number.
He stared at the screen, jaw tightening.
He let it ring, hoping that the person would give up and hang up.
Once.
Twice.
Three times.
Still ringing.
His hand hovered over the device. A tight, annoyed breath escaped him, and finally, with a reluctant tap, he brought the phone to his ear.
""Arthur Auclair.""
There was silence on the line. The kind that clung to the air like fog.
Then, a woman's voice‚Äîsoft but urgent.
""Mr. Auclair... this is Anna, I'm a social worker. I believe I've found your sister.""
Arthur froze.
Every muscle in his body locked as if ice had replaced his blood. His heart didn't just stop‚Äîit slammed to a halt in his chest.
What...?
Blair?
No. No, this was a sick joke. A cruel, calculated lie.
The warmth drained from his face, his voice suddenly cold enough to crack bone.
""Do you have a death wish?"" he snarled.
There was a stunned pause on the other end.
""W-what? No‚Äîno! I have proof! I'm a social worker‚Äî""
Click.
He hung up.
Arthur stood in the silence of his room, breath ragged, fury bubbling under the surface like lava beneath the earth.
His little sister had been gone for nine years.
Gone, disappeared.
And some stranger had the audacity to whisper her name like she could just reappear?
He made his way down to the dining room, footsteps heavy. He didn't speak a word as he sat down at the head of the table, listening to his brothers speak about their day.
But Anna wasn't finished.
‚∏ª
Back in her office, Anna stared at her phone in disbelief. He had hung up.
Her hands trembled slightly as she pressed her palms into her desk. She had proof. She had the DNA match, the reports, the photos. He hadn't even listened.
With a frustrated breath, she pushed her glasses higher on her nose and pulled her laptop closer.
""If he won't listen,"" she muttered, ""then I'll make him.""
She stared by firing off emails‚Äîto Arthur's business contact form, to his secretary, to the Auclair family's press office, even to some of his brothers' official websites. Anyone with an inbox tied to the name Auclair got a message.
Her subject line was always the same:
Your sister is alive.
‚∏ª
At the estate, Arthur sat alone in his personal study. The room was dark, illuminated only by the screen of his computer.
The email count was climbing‚Äîfast.
Seventeen unread messages, then twenty, now twenty-five.
All from the same woman.
Anna O'Brien.
He stared at the screen, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. His expression was unreadable‚Äîfrozen, statuesque, but behind his eyes was a storm gathering speed.
Just what did this woman want from him?
Attention? Money? Power? A interview?
He was about to shut the laptop when the door opened behind him.
Louis stepped in, casual in a navy turtleneck, holding his phone in one hand. His face was puzzled and faintly irritated.
""You're getting them too, aren't you?"" he asked.
Arthur looked up slowly. ""Getting what?""
Louis stepped closer, waving his phone. ""Emails. From a woman named Anna. She says she found‚Äî""
He hesitated.
Said the name like it might crumble in his mouth.
""‚ÄîBlair.""
Arthur's jaw clenched. His hands flexed once on the desk.
""She called me,"" he said, voice flat. ""I hung up. Thought it was a sick joke.""
Louis didn't speak for a moment. Then, quietly:
""It might be a joke. But... it might not.""
The silence between them stretched long and tense.
Arthur exhaled harshly through his nose, jaw ticking. Then, with sudden resolve, he picked up his phone and tapped the screen.
He found the number. The same one he had dismissed just an hour or so earlier.
He dialed.
It rang once.
Twice.
Then‚Äî
""Hello?"" came her voice, uncertain and breathless.
Arthur leaned back in his chair, eyes sharp as blades.
""You have five minutes,"" he said coldly. ""Start talking.""
If this was a lie, he would bury her name in silence and ruin.
But if it was the truth...

My spouse (24 NB) and I (27MtF) have a baby, and we're in love in that happily ever after kind of way. Every day is cutesy cuddles, we love showing each other songs that make us think of one another, cooking together is one of our bonding hobbies, we crochet each other projects, we love playing any and every video game together, we're super passionate about movies we discover together or want to show each other, I just love everything about this person and my list of ways we bond could go kn forever because we seem to just love everything tigether. After some time though, we've realized we may have some desires we cant give each other, and we've had thoughts on our mind longer than we even realized ourselves. We opened up to be a poly relationship. We each want to find a separate somebody as a separate romantic outlet for lack of better words. 

Anyway, I found my person very quickly, and I quickly developed a HUGE crush. My spouse thinks its adorable and hilarious, but me and my new gal pal (32MtF) have been all over each other, always texting when separate, and the thing is she's the more distant cool chick badass type, and im pretty punk but totally more affectionate and cutesy when it comes to romance. I like her so much I find myself blushing when I remember the way she winks at me. I've totally been simping. And the fun part is SHE LIKES ME BACK like a lot. We're going to keep seeing each other and she's going to keep being so cool and hard-core and metal head rad girl and im going to continue being super affectionate while she thinks I'm some cute little dork uuugggggg I just want to give her a big hug and smell her hair üò≠ and she totally is way more affectionate than she realizes too. She says she can be emotionally distant but last night we cuddled passing our joint back and forth, she did my hair and showed me how to keep frizz down (very hard to accomplish for me but she nailed it) she put on her favorite black lipstick to match mine for an adorable matching selfie together (and for smearing üòè) we are able to bond in ways I haven't experienced with anybody yet. For instance, we both only came out as trans in the last couple years. But also we can bond in ways I just dont have with my spouse,  not that its a bad thing, but we seem to like experiencing a new set of similarities and differences with different pwople. When I cuddle my spouse we listen to things like Yungblud or Sabrina Carpenter on vinyl and drink super sweet coffee, while with my gal pal we cuddle and listen to Against Me! or DeafHeaven or 100 Gecs on vinyl and smoke a bunch of joints. These are just some examples of how different their personalities are while also being a great match for me, there's totally tons of examples I just cant sit here and expand on character traits. Anyway, we're both excited to keep seeing each other and watch our relationship grow and talk about things from nonsense to deep rabbit holes of thought and give more amazing cuddles and kisses and hugs and and and (there's more but I'll keep this SFW)

Thanks for reading my wall of text! (She said to probably nobody)

1lgiv4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lgiv4u/station_blackout/,Station Blackout,"The night shift at WXCR-980 always starts with the same liturgy of small comforts:

* Click the breaker that wakes the transmitter racks, watch filaments glow orange like distant campfires in the dark.
* Kick off my boots, because the floor of this place hums‚Äîbare sock-soles translate the tower‚Äôs heartbeat better than steel-toed leather.
* Pour reheated Community Coffee into a chipped mug that says¬†*‚ÄúHurricane Party Crew, ‚Äô79.‚Äù*

Outside, the Gulf is exhaling slow, sticky breaths across the marshes. Every few seconds thunder grumbles beyond the tree line, a dog too lazy to stand. Wind combs the spartina grass, climbs the tower legs, and sighs around the guy wires. In the equipment bay those sighs resolve into resonant pings: aluminum skin flexing, then relaxing, like ribs around a lungful of air. The building is older than the interstate; every joist and rivet keeps its own weather diary.

My only company is the machinery. Behind me, twin Collins 20 kW transmitters‚Äîsurplus from the Eisenhower era‚Äîloaf at 30 percent power, red jewel lamps blinking a slow morse of contentment. To the left, a cart machine spits out midnight PSAs on squeaking cartridges. To the right, a green-phosphor radar repeater shows local doppler returns. Normally the scope is a rosette of calm grays, but tonight there‚Äôs a curious blemish: one spiral cell, dead center, not drifting inland with the rest of the storm line‚Äîmerely¬†*pulsing in place,*¬†like a jellyfish flexing translucent muscles.

A curiosity, nothing more. I make a log entry, sip lukewarm coffee, cue the next weather break.

The first oddity is almost courteous. During the forecast, bedded beneath the narrator‚Äôs baritone, I hear‚Ä¶extraneous syllables. Like a party line from another century, two voices sharing one wire. Each whisper perches on the shoulders of the approved words:

‚Äú*‚Äîwinds from the south-southwest*¬†**(we are beneath you)**¬†*gusting thirty knots‚Ä¶*‚Äù

I tap the VU meter: solid. Check the carrier deviation: nominal. Still, the whispers persist, riding the modulation envelope like tiny fish drafted in a whale‚Äôs slipstream. The moment I fade the mic pot, they vanish.

Leaving the control room, I walk the corridor of dusty storage closets until I reach the patch panel closet‚Äîan ex-janitor‚Äôs nook hung with raw telephone blocks and lightning arrestors. The copper smells of pennies licked clean. I lift the headset that taps the raw line. Silence‚Äîthen, faintly, what might be breath oscillating near the threshold of hearing.

It‚Äôs late. I chalk it up to crosspatch crosstalk.

Rain begins in earnest, drumming the tin roof hard enough that dust shakes from fluorescent covers. I switch on the Emergency Alert System decoder to run the routine weekly test‚Äînothing unusual for a Wednesday night. The device is a relic: yellowed plastic, an LCD that leaks light around its edges, a thermal printer that gnaws tiny paper scrolls.

I punch¬†*RWT*‚ÄîRequired Weekly Test.  
The decoder barks its familiar three tones:¬†*ÀóÀó-‚ÄÜ‚ÄäÀóÀó-‚ÄÜ‚ÄäÀóÀó-*

But the carrier that follows is off somehow. Instead of the expected shrill digital burble, I hear a harmonic stack like a pipe organ warming up‚Äîlow D-flat in teeth-rattling overdrive. A fourth tone slips in, then a fifth, until the chord is fat, rotting, unsanctioned by any protocol manual.

I abort the test. The chord echoes away, leaving the sensation of cavities tugged by dental suction. I should phone the National Weather Service relay in Mobile, let them know someone‚Äôs spoofing headers, but the landline gives nothing except a hiss that modulates like speech reversed.

A sense of private embarrassment flushes me, as though I‚Äôve walked in on two strangers arguing through a keyhole. I unplug, replug, and promise myself fresh coffee.

The spiral cell on radar is still there. Everything else has marched north-east in obedient vectors, but that one anomaly tightens and loosens, a sleeping fist, never leaving its coordinates: Lat 30.742 N, Lon ‚àí88.135 W‚Äîalmost perfectly atop our own tower site.

I raise the gain. The shape resolves: a cyclonic eye only five miles wide. Its reflectivity spikes like a sonar ping, blinks off, spikes again‚Äîperiodic as a cardiac rhythm.

The tower groans as wind angles shift. I look up through the ceiling vent and imagine the 700-foot mast pendulating against black cloud. Somewhere up there, red aircraft beacons wink sanguine reassurance. If lightning nails the catenary wire, a surge will goose every cabinet here; I should be nervous about fire. Instead, I feel‚Ä¶watched.

The EAS decoder shrieks without preamble. Printer paper spits like a party blower:

ZCZC-ORG-CAE-UNKNOWN-BIOLOGICAL-THREAT EAS-0/07, COUNTY-000, VALID UNTIL 0300 SHELTER INDOORS. SECURE AIR INLETS.

No call-sign header, no sender ID. Just¬†*UNKNOWN.*¬†Worse: the header class is¬†*CAE*‚ÄîCivil Authority Event‚Äîbut no civil authority in Alabama uses that code without prefix.

The system forces an auto-switch. All feeds‚ÄîAM program, FM relay, even the old NOAA weather rebroadcast‚Äîduck beneath that same bass-organ tone. A charcoal banner scrolls across every monitor:

**UNKNOWN BIOLOGICAL THREAT ‚Äî SHELTER INDOORS**

My scalp prickles. Biological threat? Out here? On a marsh island housing one overworked radio nerd and a flock of mosquito-fat herons?

I grab the Red Phone, a direct copper pair to the state EOC. The handset is cold. When I press it to my ear I expect dial tone, but get a distant wavering chorus‚Äîmultiple voices, overlapping, crying in cycles of six or seven syllables each. No language I know. Some pleas, maybe, but shaped wrong: vowels sag where consonants should snap. I slam the cradle, try again. Same.

Short-wave becomes my next lifeline. I pull the Kenwood transceiver from its shelf and thumb through HF bands. Static, some Cuban music, then: a man sobbing ‚Äú*‚Ä¶don‚Äôt touch the rain, don‚Äôt*‚Äî‚Äù before an electrical smack wipes the frequency.

Lightning backlights the storm. In that flash the spiral cell outside isn‚Äôt a cloud at all but a silhouette, a maw pressed against the sky, interior lit with witch-light. The hole in the weather rotates like a turbine.

I note the time, jot the gibberish header into the station log‚Äîper FCC rules, even if the whole nation‚Äôs gone off-script. My pen trembles, making spidery letters on the green ledger.

Backup generator fumes drift in through the louvers‚Äîa warning that mains power just failed. Fluorescents wink out, leaving only filament lamps and CRT faces. Their glow feels aquatic, as though I‚Äôve slid under black water.

I try the trunked sheriff net on the old Uniden scanner. Every channel is an open mic of wind roar and a single recurring tone:¬†*boop-boop-boop, pause; boop-boop-boop.*¬†Morse¬†*S O S*¬†if you bend the timing, but slurred.

My breath fogs. The air-handler‚Äôs dead, yet humidity spikes; the room sweats. I yank open the breaker panel‚Äîcontactors rattle like bones. The generator outside chugs unevenly, coughing blue flame.

Paper curls from the EAS printer, ink ribbon stuttering where the glyphs exceed ASCII:

ZCZC-ORG-CAE-UNHOLY-BIOLOGICAL-HAZARD

The middle line prints as a row of squares, then a smear where the thermal head sticks. Above, the crawl on the control-room monitor abandons Latin characters entirely, unfurling symbols older than alphabets: interlocking spirals, barbed crescents, what might be cuneiform but angled like broken limbs. The color inverter misbehaves, casting the text in bruise-purple.

The generator hiccups, drops frequency; every transformer in the racks screams a descending pitch, like an orchestra tuning in reverse. My coffee mug vibrates to the edge of the console and suicides to the floor.

Outside, hail begins‚Äîexcept hail doesn‚Äôt ordinarily¬†*hiss.*¬†The pellets strike the roof with a sound like fizzing dry ice. A whiff of hot tar and sulfur punches through the vents. I unlatch the steel door, peer through the storm-shroud. Raindrops aren‚Äôt transparent; they‚Äôre black, viscous, smoking where they hit galvanized metal. Each droplet leaves a pinhole scorch. The building‚Äôs skin pocks like blistered paint.

Lightning rips again, horizontal this time, veining the entire sky. In the flicker I see appendages dangling from the rotating maw‚Äîropes of darkness, jointed in too many places, each tip loaded with finger-like petals unfurling to taste the air. When the flash fades, after-images dance on my retina: purple filaments, inverted crosses, hungry.

I close the door. The latch feels hot‚Äîno, it feels¬†*alive,*¬†pulsing, as though something on the other side inhales through the metal.

No header now. The system doesn‚Äôt print; it¬†*bleeds*¬†symbols down the CRT, characters shedding digital phosphor like scabs. A single line remains legible:

**LIVE MANUAL OVERRIDE REQUIRED**

A prompt cursor blinks. The EAS wants a human voice. The protocol is clear: in absence of authority, a licensed operator may relay the scripted message. Failure to comply‚Ä¶well, the FCC never described a sanction for end-times demonic weather abominations, but fines seem trivial compared to whatever waits outside.

The crawl populates new text, demanding I read¬†*verbatim.*¬†The language is half English, half that wrong cuneiform rendered phonetically:

‚Äú*BY THE SALT OF BLOOD AND THE BREATH OF IRON, WE CALL THE HOST.*‚Äù

I taste copper already, a psychosomatic nosebleed threatening.

I hesitate. Thunder rolls but does not fade; it sustains like an organ drone. Inside that rumble, I swear syllables echo the script‚Äîanticipating, coaxing.

A tremor rattles the racks. Vacuum tubes quiver in sockets. One bursts, releasing violet corona and a dragon-smoke stench. I flinch as glass shards ping off my headset.

A thought surfaces, bright and treasonous:¬†*Refuse.*¬†Smash the transmitter. Break the chain.

Yet the cursor blinks, patient.

I reach for the mic.

I key the mic, heart doing double-time. My throat quivers like a mis-tuned reed, but I force the first line through clenched teeth:

**BY THE SALT OF BLOOD AND THE BREATH OF IRON, WE CALL THE HOST‚Äî**

The studio fluorescents flare, then gutter to black. The only light comes from oscilloscopes‚Äîgreen cursors flailing as if panicked. The tower‚Äôs beacon lamps, visible through the narrow window, burn¬†*violet,*¬†the color of deep bruises on flesh long dead.

The crawl rattles on, spitting fresh text:

**DELIVER THE FLESH, DELIVER THE AIR, DELIVER THE MARROW OF WIRE AND BONE.**

A pressure settles over my sternum, like a child standing on my chest. Each syllable tastes metallic. The acrid sting of ozone and ruptured capacitors curdles the back of my tongue.

Something stirs under the floor panels. A hollow¬†*thud-thud-thud,*¬†as if knuckles of bone rap against the plywood from the crawlspace. The building is on stilts‚Äîhurricane codes from the fifties‚Äîbut that void has held only spiders and rust since the day I signed on here. Tonight, it houses¬†*movement.*

I cut the mic. The tower side air monitor falls silent for the first time in sixty years. The instant the carrier drops, the floor knocks cease.

Silence becomes its own threat‚Äîthicker than the storm. I catch my breath in short gasps, lungs feeling foreign. The EAS printer ticks again, but no paper feeds; the stepper motor chews dryly, printing words straight onto the platen:

**THE CALL WAS NOT COMPLETED**

**COMPLETE THE CALL**

**OR BE CONSUMED**

I back away. My heel crushes shards of my coffee mug, drawing blood‚Äîquick, bright beads on linoleum. The scent snaps me awake: ferric, human, mine.

The transmitter racks pound like drums‚Äîcontactors slamming open and shut in arrhythmic fury, metal-on-metal impacts so violent I feel the vibration in fillings and finger bones. The Collins rigs are old, but never¬†*this*¬†alive.

On the radar repeater the spiral eye has ruptured. Tendrils radiate, branching lightning-veins of hyper-reflectivity, but the pattern refuses to drift. It grows outward in concentric rings, like ink dropped into milk, until the whole screen blinds to pure white. Then the phosphor chars: a black hole blooms dead-center, eating the glass from the inside out.

I snap the scope power off; the after-image floats on the inner lids of my eyes‚Äîa perfect negative sun with barbed corona.

A scream shreds the silence. Not over the monitors‚Äî*inside the walls.*¬†Corrugated steel buckles inward between studs, elbows of shadow punching through as if some huge thing braces to shove. Every girder squeals.

My station log lies open where the coffee stains spider outward into broken maps of delta rivers. I ought to keep logging‚Äîduty drilled by the FCC manual‚Äîbut the pen trembles uselessly in scorched fingertips.

Thunder rolls again, but this time it doesn‚Äôt fade. It loops‚Äîa sampled roar a full minute long, repeating every sixty-three seconds, a perfect autopsy of natural sound. Between loops, a voice coils beneath the thunder‚Äôs belly, layering like a bass note: a guttural chant in that alphabet no human throat should shape.

The chant syncs with generator cycles: each phrase lands as the diesel pistons crest TDC, as though the engine itself lends its compression strokes to the incantation.

My gaze drifts to the circuit breaker labeled¬†*MAIN PA.*¬†I remember the auxiliary crowbar switch wired by some paranoid predecessor: yank that handle and every output coil dumps to ground, vaporizing the copper fuses‚Äîan irreversible kill. The tower would fall silent.

The choice is simple mathematics: broadcast the summoning, or kill the voice line forever and pray that breaks the spell. But if I drop carrier, county emergency receivers go dark too; civilians will lose their only warning.

The floor knocks return‚Äîmore insistent, directly beneath the breaker cabinet. Part of me knows: it wants me to choose.

I crack the side door three inches to gauge the storm. A gale slams the slab so hard it nearly tears the hinge bolts. Black rain hisses across the threshold, boiling where it lands on cement. The odor is obscene: meat left under heat lamps, mingled with wet electronics.

Lightning pulses constant now‚Äîstrobe-light white, so rapid night and day blur. In those frozen frames the cyclone overhead has unspooled into a vertical column descending from cloud deck to the tower‚Äôs crown. The column is semi-transparent, its core a void, its surface rippling with embedded limbs: jointed spines that gnash like teeth. They grip guy wires, using them as ladder rungs.

Each time violet beacon strobes, the creature inches closer.

The tower sways beyond spec; the top array whips ten degrees off centerline. Guy wires twang‚Äîdeep bass strings plucked by cosmic fingers.

I slam the door, bar it with the mic boom stand, blood pattering from my heel cut in little half-dried commas.

The EAS printer screeches one last time‚Äîthermal head digging a trench through itself. Sparks flutter. On the paper drum a single sentence etches in blackened carbon:

**LIVE MANUAL OVERRIDE OR ABSORPTION**

The crawl on every CRT flash inverted colors‚Äîletterbox bars filling with static snow‚Äîthen resolves into my own face, as captured by no camera on site. The visage is¬†*future me*: pallid, veins in spider-web bloom under skin, mouth slack, eyes black as empty sockets. That version of me mouths the override script, syllables steaming like wet iron hammered in winter.

I stagger back. My heel lands on the mic pedal, opening the channel. Air monitor returns live‚Äîdead carrier hiss, then my own breathing pumped through a five-kilowatt PA, flutter-echoing in the shell of the building.

Somehow the tower hears that breath. The mass of metal above responds: the beacon flashes accelerate, violet into ultraviolet, a hue beyond vision that still scalds retinas.

A fetal-beat throb clutches my sternum‚Äîan external pulse manhandling my heart. I hear blood roar in auditory nerves. The virtue of electricity is inversion: input becomes output becomes input. Some loop has me in it now.

I wrench the pedal up, cut the feed. The pulse ebbs a shade. The choice clarifies: finish the script or fight.

I take the mic in both blistered hands. Copper coils inside have gone cherry-hot; the aluminum shell leaves white brands on my palms. Words sit on the teleprompter‚Äîglyphs transliterated to the Latin alphabet, footnoted by bastard syllabics. I draw breath while the thing in the cloud lowers its endless torso along the tower spine.

The first phrase spills out despite me, yanked up from diaphragm like retch:

**‚ÄúANO·π¢ UL-ZATHOTH KHA‚ÄôL√çTH MAKH‚Äî‚Äù**

Each utterance feels like tearing gauze from raw gum. Static builds on my tongue‚Äîliteral sparks snapping between molars. Violet beacon flares cascade down the tower skeleton, chasing my words. The entity‚Äôs tendrils braid tight around the mast, anchors seeking purchase.

Halfway through the third line my vision tunnels. Edge-darkness presses inward until only the ASCII prompt floats in chiaroscuro spotlight. A euphoric swirl threatens‚Äîa velvet heat promising relief if I just¬†*finish the sentence.*

Instead, I bite my own tongue hard enough to burst tastebuds. Blood floods the mouth with iron and copper‚Äîearthy, human,¬†*wrong*¬†to them. The trance snaps like a guitar string.

The teleprompter glitches, scripts resetting to all-caps English:

**STOP THE CALL IS OUR ONLY PATH, YOU ARE THE THROAT**

I spit blood onto the plastic keys. It steams, etching key switch legends. The racks behind me wail‚Äîbearings seizing as tubes run away into thermal meltdown.

I pivot on raw feet toward the crowbar lever. One yard south, metal skins of the floor ripple‚Äîpaint bubbles then rip. A limb no thicker than coax cable weaves up through the opening: not flesh, not wire, but braided tendon glistening like oiled piano string. It builds an elbow, sprouts three digits, each tipped with copper bus-bar claws. Lightning arcs fingertip to fingertip.

It bars my path, gesturing me back to the mic.

My hands grope behind, find the portable field recorder‚Äîbattery pack still fresh. I thumb it on, crank gain to max. Feedback rises, keening. I shove its piezo mic into the transmitter‚Äôs PA loop. A sine shriek erupts, forty kilohertz down-converted by amplifier aliasing into sub-audible gut-wrench territory.

The limb recoils, metal claws shredding ceiling tile. I lunge under it, slam the crowbar down.

A flash brighter than arc-welding erases the world.

Every relay detonates simultaneously. Glass dust gusts through the room as tubes implode. The main step-up transformer outside howls, then falls silent. For a heartbeat there is no sound anywhere‚Äîthe whole Gulf muted. Instruments peg zero.

Then the storm screams. Without the carrier hum to mask it, the creature‚Äôs voice tears loose: a continental-shelf moan at infrasonic depth, vibrating bones first, eardrums second. The limb under the floor thrashes, trying to re-establish line of sight.

I shoulder the door open and sprint into night.

Wind knocks me sideways‚Äîhurricane-force, yet the anemometer cup I pass spins lazily, wrong physics. Black rain peppers my jacket, sizzling holes through nylon. Where droplets hit skin, they raise weeping welts. I drag my sleeve across cheek, smear oily streaks.

Lightning forks ground-ward in¬†*slow motion,*¬†each branch moving like a sewer centipede feeling for purchase. Every strike leaf after-glow filament that crawl back up the path, reverse-lancing skyward to feed the hungering core.

The tower behind me groans, bereft of its electrical blood. The entity slackens‚Äîthe violet beacon dying green, then red, then nothing. It bellows rage, a sub-bass concussion that flaps my coat like canvas. Tendrils release, whiplashing free. One slices a guy wire; the steel whip whistles across mud, decapitates a palmetto, buries itself smoking in loam three yards from my path.

I veer, half-blind, toward the tree line where an old civil-defense bunker squats, forgotten since nuclear-raid drills of Eisenhower days. The access hatch is eighty yards through sawgrass and ankle-deep mire.

Behind me the tower‚Äôs mast bows‚Äîtop segment folding as tendrils yank. Steel lattice screams, snapping bracket welds. The whole superstructure tilts toward the Gulf, hurling loose insulators in parabolic arcs that splash molten into the rain.

County tornado sirens, three miles inland, awaken‚Äî*but on DC power, cycling wrong notes.*¬†Their warble climbs past human hearing, Doppler‚Äôd by shredded wind into banshee keening. Each siren tower flickers strobe red-white-red, as though scanning for living heat.

Marsh grass around me combusts soundlessly: black raindrops turning blades to carbon lace. The air tastes like hot pennies. My lungs itch deep, cilia crisping.

The hatch appears‚Äîa squat steel coffin lid half buried under vines. I skid to kneel, palms leaving skin on the rust-covered handle. It will not budge. Lock pins seized by sixty years of salt.

Lightning overhead coagulates into a single lance; the entity condenses, all tendrils withdrawn into a meat-meteor descending point-first. I feel its gravitational intent in organs‚Äîkidneys sliding upward, stomach falling, a wrong tilt of physics.

I yank the bolt-cutters holstered on my belt‚Äîtower work habit‚Äîand snap the padlock. The shackle disintegrates in my scorched grip. I heave the lid. Hinges scream but give.

Sulfur lamp glow from my pocket lantern slices the bunker ladder. I dive, slam hatch after me just as thunder halts mid-rumble‚Äîaudio tape paused.

Through six inches of poured concrete the explosion is mute, but pressure ripples compress air hard enough to crack my eardrums. Dust mushrooms off cinderblock walls in grey puffs. I huddle in a fetal cradle under the defunct radiation-meter panel, lantern jitter-shadowing dials that all point thirteen o‚Äôclock.

The entity‚Äôs roar modulates into something else‚Äîa keening uncertainty. Denied its broadcast umbilical, it thrashes skyward again. Atmospheric pressure flips; a distant¬†*whump*¬†pops vents in the hatch above, sucking air upward. Then nothing but drizzle pattering metal.

Lantern light shows blistered hands‚Äîfingertips split, nails blackened. A runnel of blood dries across chin from the tongue-bite. My heel wound‚Äîcoffee-mug glass‚Äîhas soaked sock scarlet. The copper taste lingers like a penny glued to palate.

Sirens above lapse one by one, power starved. In their absences crickets dare a chirp‚Äîthen silence claims even them. The only sound is bunker ventilation wheezing like asthmatic bellows.

**‚Ä¶**

 I fumble for my phone‚Äîmiraculously still dry inside my jacket. The screen splutters to life at minimum brightness: **2 %**. No bars, then one, then a ghost of ‚ÄúLTE,‚Äù like a rescue flare that can‚Äôt make up its mind.

I huddle beneath the cracked civil-defense meter, slide my back down the wall until soggy boots splay in front of me. Blisters scream, but the pain is human and therefore reassuring. I thumb in my pattern lock; the screen‚Äôs oily glass sticks to burned fingerprints.

Air above the hatch booms‚Äîsomething heavy dragging itself in furious circles‚Äîbut down here the only noise is my ragged breath and the tick of raindrops sizzling on steel overhead. I open Reddit, start typing. Autocorrect can‚Äôt parse half the placenames or profanity, but it hardly matters; this write-up isn‚Äôt going to an editor.

I copy-paste GPS coordinates, tack on the call-sign **WXCR-980**, tag every emergency-services handle I can guess. *Maybe a bot still watches the firehose.* The cursor lags, battery warning pops up: **‚ÄúLow Power Mode?‚Äù** I jab *Yes* and keep going, thumbs skating over spider-web cracks.

A triple-tone EAS header chirps from the speaker, soft but unmistakable. The phone isn‚Äôt tuned to any broadcast, yet the tones play anyway‚Äîoff-key, like a flute carved from bone. After the tones, text auto-fills the screen without my input:

**LIVE MANUAL OVERRIDE OR ABSORPTION**

I smash volume down, but the message re-appears in the text field, shoving aside my draft. The phone vibrates‚Äîa haptic Morse that syncs with the thunder loops outside. For a second I consider throwing the device against the wall, but it‚Äôs my only keyhole to the surface.

Instead, I type over the glyphs, overwrite every line with one frantic plea: **‚ÄúDO NOT RESPOND TO UNSANCTIONED ALERTS. KILL YOUR TRANSMITTERS. SILENCE SAVES.‚Äù**

The LTE indicator flickers, clings to life. I copy everything into a new post, paste the same warning until the buffer chokes.

One bar. *Send failure.* I raise the phone toward the ventilation shaft where violet glow seeps like swamp-gas. Second try‚Äîprogress wheel crawls. The entity overhead bellows, concrete dust raining from the ceiling. *Third try.*

A single **whoosh**‚Äîthe notification sound I‚Äôve heard a thousand times‚Äîechoes impossibly loud in the bunker. The progress wheel spins itself to completion. *Posted.* Somewhere beyond this coffin, packets hop towers, traverse fiber, find servers I pray still breathe.

The screen dims to ember glow. **1 %**. I thumb out a final line beneath the post:

*Battery dying. I‚Äôm staying radio silent. If you read this, pass it on‚Äîcut the signal before it speaks through you.*

I don‚Äôt hit Send; auto-upload flicks it into the cloud just before the screen goes black. In the sudden dark I hear only the bunker‚Äôs asthmatic ventilation and the distant, frustrated screech of something colossal denied its throat.

I lay the phone on my chest like a spent flare. Maybe rescue crews will triangulate the last ping; maybe no one will. Either way, the message is out, traveling at light-speed while I curl in analog dark, alive by definition only.

Above, the sirens stutter and expire. The crawlspace settles into a hush so total my pulse sounds like footsteps. But for now‚Äî*for now*‚Äîthe Emergency Alert System is quiet, and I am still breathing.",1,1750463801.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Outside, the Gulf is exhaling slow, sticky breaths across the marshes. Every few seconds thunder grumbles beyond the tree line, a dog too lazy to stand. Wind combs the spartina grass, climbs the tower legs, and sighs around the guy wires. In the equipment bay those sighs resolve into resonant pings: aluminum skin flexing, then relaxing, like ribs around a lungful of air. The building is older than the interstate; every joist and rivet keeps its own weather diary.

My only company is the machinery. Behind me, twin Collins 20 kW transmitters‚Äîsurplus from the Eisenhower era‚Äîloaf at 30 percent power, red jewel lamps blinking a slow morse of contentment. To the left, a cart machine spits out midnight PSAs on squeaking cartridges. To the right, a green-phosphor radar repeater shows local doppler returns. Normally the scope is a rosette of calm grays, but tonight there‚Äôs a curious blemish: one spiral cell, dead center, not drifting inland with the rest of the storm line‚Äîmerely¬†*pulsing in place,*¬†like a jellyfish flexing translucent muscles.

A curiosity, nothing more. I make a log entry, sip lukewarm coffee, cue the next weather break.

The first oddity is almost courteous. During the forecast, bedded beneath the narrator‚Äôs baritone, I hear‚Ä¶extraneous syllables. Like a party line from another century, two voices sharing one wire. Each whisper perches on the shoulders of the approved words:

‚Äú*‚Äîwinds from the south-southwest*¬†**(we are beneath you)**¬†*gusting thirty knots‚Ä¶*‚Äù

I tap the VU meter: solid. Check the carrier deviation: nominal. Still, the whispers persist, riding the modulation envelope like tiny fish drafted in a whale‚Äôs slipstream. The moment I fade the mic pot, they vanish.

Leaving the control room, I walk the corridor of dusty storage closets until I reach the patch panel closet‚Äîan ex-janitor‚Äôs nook hung with raw telephone blocks and lightning arrestors.

But the carrier that follows is off somehow. Instead of the expected shrill digital burble, I hear a harmonic stack like a pipe organ warming up‚Äîlow D-flat in teeth-rattling overdrive. A fourth tone slips in, then a fifth, until the chord is fat, rotting, unsanctioned by any protocol manual.

I abort the test. The chord echoes away, leaving the sensation of cavities tugged by dental suction. I should phone the National Weather Service relay in Mobile, let them know someone‚Äôs spoofing headers, but the landline gives nothing except a hiss that modulates like speech reversed.

My breath fogs. The air-handler‚Äôs dead, yet humidity spikes; the room sweats. I yank open the breaker panel‚Äîcontactors rattle like bones. The generator outside chugs unevenly, coughing blue flame.

Paper curls from the EAS printer, ink ribbon stuttering where the glyphs exceed ASCII:

ZCZC-ORG-CAE-UNHOLY-BIOLOGICAL-HAZARD

The middle line prints as a row of squares, then a smear where the thermal head sticks. Above, the crawl on the control-room monitor abandons Latin characters entirely, unfurling symbols older than alphabets: interlocking spirals, barbed crescents, what might be cuneiform but angled like broken limbs. The color inverter misbehaves, casting the text in bruise-purple.

The generator hiccups, drops frequency; every transformer in the racks screams a descending pitch, like an orchestra tuning in reverse. My coffee mug vibrates to the edge of the console and suicides to the floor.

Outside, hail begins‚Äîexcept hail doesn‚Äôt ordinarily¬†*hiss.*¬†The pellets strike the roof with a sound like fizzing dry ice. A whiff of hot tar and sulfur punches through the vents. I unlatch the steel door, peer through the storm-shroud. Raindrops aren‚Äôt transparent; they‚Äôre black, viscous, smoking where they hit galvanized metal. Each droplet leaves a pinhole scorch. The building‚Äôs skin pocks like blistered paint.

Lightning rips again, horizontal this time, veining the entire sky. In the flicker I see appendages dangling from the rotating maw‚Äîropes of darkness, jointed in too many places, each tip loaded with finger-like petals unfurling to taste the air. When the flash fades, after-images dance on my retina: purple filaments, inverted crosses, hungry.

I close the door. The latch feels hot‚Äîno, it feels¬†*alive,*¬†pulsing, as though something on the other side inhales through the metal.

No header now. The system doesn‚Äôt print; it¬†*bleeds*¬†symbols down the CRT, characters shedding digital phosphor like scabs. A single line remains legible:

**LIVE MANUAL OVERRIDE REQUIRED**

A prompt cursor blinks. The EAS wants a human voice. The protocol is clear: in absence of authority, a licensed operator may relay the scripted message. Failure to comply‚Ä¶well, the FCC never described a sanction for end-times demonic weather abominations, but fines seem trivial compared to whatever waits outside.

The crawl populates new text, demanding I read¬†*verbatim.*¬†The language is half English, half that wrong cuneiform rendered phonetically:

‚Äú*BY THE SALT OF BLOOD AND THE BREATH OF IRON, WE CALL THE HOST.*‚Äù

I taste copper already, a psychosomatic nosebleed threatening.

I hesitate. Thunder rolls but does not fade; it sustains like an organ drone. Inside that rumble, I swear syllables echo the script‚Äîanticipating, coaxing.

A tremor rattles the racks. Vacuum tubes quiver in sockets. One bursts, releasing violet corona and a dragon-smoke stench. I flinch as glass shards ping off my headset.

A thought surfaces, bright and treasonous:¬†*Refuse.*¬†Smash the transmitter. Break the chain.

Yet the cursor blinks, patient.

I reach for the mic.

I key the mic, heart doing double-time. My throat quivers like a mis-tuned reed, but I force the first line through clenched teeth:

**BY THE SALT OF BLOOD AND THE BREATH OF IRON, WE CALL THE HOST‚Äî**

The studio fluorescents flare, then gutter to black. The only light comes from oscilloscopes‚Äîgreen cursors flailing as if panicked. The tower‚Äôs beacon lamps, visible through the narrow window, burn¬†*violet,*¬†the color of deep bruises on flesh long dead.

The crawl rattles on, spitting fresh text:

**DELIVER THE FLESH, DELIVER THE AIR, DELIVER THE MARROW OF WIRE AND BONE.**

A pressure settles over my sternum, like a child standing on my chest. Each syllable tastes metallic. The acrid sting of ozone and ruptured capacitors curdles the back of my tongue.

Something stirs under the floor panels. A hollow¬†*thud-thud-thud,*¬†as if knuckles of bone rap against the plywood from the crawlspace. The building is on stilts‚Äîhurricane codes from the fifties‚Äîbut that void has held only spiders and rust since the day I signed on here. Tonight, it houses¬†*movement.*

I cut the mic. The tower side air monitor falls silent for the first time in sixty years. The instant the carrier drops, the floor knocks cease.

Silence becomes its own threat‚Äîthicker than the storm. I catch my breath in short gasps, lungs feeling foreign. The EAS printer ticks again, but no paper feeds; the stepper motor chews dryly, printing words straight onto the platen:

**THE CALL WAS NOT COMPLETED**

**COMPLETE THE CALL**

**OR BE CONSUMED**

I back away. My heel crushes shards of my coffee mug, drawing blood‚Äîquick, bright beads on linoleum. The scent snaps me awake: ferric, human, mine.

The transmitter racks pound like drums‚Äîcontactors slamming open and shut in arrhythmic fury, metal-on-metal impacts so violent I feel the vibration in fillings and finger bones. The Collins rigs are old, but never¬†*this*¬†alive.

On the radar repeater the spiral eye has ruptured. Tendrils radiate, branching lightning-veins of hyper-reflectivity, but the pattern refuses to drift. It grows outward in concentric rings, like ink dropped into milk, until the whole screen blinds to pure white. Then the phosphor chars: a black hole blooms dead-center, eating the glass from the inside out.

I snap the scope power off; the after-image floats on the inner lids of my eyes‚Äîa perfect negative sun with barbed corona.

A scream shreds the silence. Not over the monitors‚Äî*inside the walls.*¬†Corrugated steel buckles inward between studs, elbows of shadow punching through as if some huge thing braces to shove. Every girder squeals.

My station log lies open where the coffee stains spider outward into broken maps of delta rivers. I ought to keep logging‚Äîduty drilled by the FCC manual‚Äîbut the pen trembles uselessly in scorched fingertips.

Thunder rolls again, but this time it doesn‚Äôt fade. It loops‚Äîa sampled roar a full minute long, repeating every sixty-three seconds, a perfect autopsy of natural sound. Between loops, a voice coils beneath the thunder‚Äôs belly, layering like a bass note: a guttural chant in that alphabet no human throat should shape.

The chant syncs with generator cycles: each phrase lands as the diesel pistons crest TDC, as though the engine itself lends its compression strokes to the incantation.

My gaze drifts to the circuit breaker labeled¬†*MAIN PA.*¬†I remember the auxiliary crowbar switch wired by some paranoid predecessor: yank that handle and every output coil dumps to ground, vaporizing the copper fuses‚Äîan irreversible kill. The tower would fall silent.

The choice is simple mathematics: broadcast the summoning, or kill the voice line forever and pray that breaks the spell. But if I drop carrier, county emergency receivers go dark too; civilians will lose their only warning.

The floor knocks return‚Äîmore insistent, directly beneath the breaker cabinet. Part of me knows: it wants me to choose.

I crack the side door three inches to gauge the storm. A gale slams the slab so hard it nearly tears the hinge bolts. Black rain hisses across the threshold, boiling where it lands on cement. The odor is obscene: meat left under heat lamps, mingled with wet electronics.

Lightning pulses constant now‚Äîstrobe-light white, so rapid night and day blur. In those frozen frames the cyclone overhead has unspooled into a vertical column descending from cloud deck to the tower‚Äôs crown. The column is semi-transparent, its core a void, its surface rippling with embedded limbs: jointed spines that gnash like teeth. They grip guy wires, using them as ladder rungs.

Each time violet beacon strobes, the creature inches closer.

The tower sways beyond spec; the top array whips ten degrees off centerline. Guy wires twang‚Äîdeep bass strings plucked by cosmic fingers.

I slam the door, bar it with the mic boom stand, blood pattering from my heel cut in little half-dried commas.

The EAS printer screeches one last time‚Äîthermal head digging a trench through itself. Sparks flutter. On the paper drum a single sentence etches in blackened carbon:

**LIVE MANUAL OVERRIDE OR ABSORPTION**

The crawl on every CRT flash inverted colors‚Äîletterbox bars filling with static snow‚Äîthen resolves into my own face, as captured by no camera on site. The visage is¬†*future me*: pallid, veins in spider-web bloom under skin, mouth slack, eyes black as empty sockets. That version of me mouths the override script, syllables steaming like wet iron hammered in winter.

I stagger back. My heel lands on the mic pedal, opening the channel. Air monitor returns live‚Äîdead carrier hiss, then my own breathing pumped through a five-kilowatt PA, flutter-echoing in the shell of the building.

Somehow the tower hears that breath. The mass of metal above responds: the beacon flashes accelerate, violet into ultraviolet, a hue beyond vision that still scalds retinas.

A fetal-beat throb clutches my sternum‚Äîan external pulse manhandling my heart. I hear blood roar in auditory nerves. The virtue of electricity is inversion: input becomes output becomes input. Some loop has me in it now.

I wrench the pedal up, cut the feed. The pulse ebbs a shade. The choice clarifies: finish the script or fight.

I take the mic in both blistered hands. Copper coils inside have gone cherry-hot; the aluminum shell leaves white brands on my palms. Words sit on the teleprompter‚Äîglyphs transliterated to the Latin alphabet, footnoted by bastard syllabics. I draw breath while the thing in the cloud lowers its endless torso along the tower spine.

The first phrase spills out despite me, yanked up from diaphragm like retch:

**‚ÄúANO·π¢ UL-ZATHOTH KHA‚ÄôL√çTH MAKH‚Äî‚Äù**

Each utterance feels like tearing gauze from raw gum. Static builds on my tongue‚Äîliteral sparks snapping between molars. Violet beacon flares cascade down the tower skeleton, chasing my words. The entity‚Äôs tendrils braid tight around the mast, anchors seeking purchase.

Halfway through the third line my vision tunnels. Edge-darkness presses inward until only the ASCII prompt floats in chiaroscuro spotlight. A euphoric swirl threatens‚Äîa velvet heat promising relief if I just¬†*finish the sentence.*

Instead, I bite my own tongue hard enough to burst tastebuds. Blood floods the mouth with iron and copper‚Äîearthy, human,¬†*wrong*¬†to them. The trance snaps like a guitar string.

The teleprompter glitches, scripts resetting to all-caps English:

**STOP THE CALL IS OUR ONLY PATH, YOU ARE THE THROAT**

I spit blood onto the plastic keys. It steams, etching key switch legends. The racks behind me wail‚Äîbearings seizing as tubes run away into thermal meltdown.

I pivot on raw feet toward the crowbar lever. One yard south, metal skins of the floor ripple‚Äîpaint bubbles then rip. A limb no thicker than coax cable weaves up through the opening: not flesh, not wire, but braided tendon glistening like oiled piano string. It builds an elbow, sprouts three digits, each tipped with copper bus-bar claws. Lightning arcs fingertip to fingertip.

It bars my path, gesturing me back to the mic.

My hands grope behind, find the portable field recorder‚Äîbattery pack still fresh. I thumb it on, crank gain to max. Feedback rises, keening. I shove its piezo mic into the transmitter‚Äôs PA loop. A sine shriek erupts, forty kilohertz down-converted by amplifier aliasing into sub-audible gut-wrench territory.

The limb recoils, metal claws shredding ceiling tile. I lunge under it, slam the crowbar down.

A flash brighter than arc-welding erases the world.

Every relay detonates simultaneously. Glass dust gusts through the room as tubes implode. The main step-up transformer outside howls, then falls silent. For a heartbeat there is no sound anywhere‚Äîthe whole Gulf muted. Instruments peg zero.

Then the storm screams. Without the carrier hum to mask it, the creature‚Äôs voice tears loose: a continental-shelf moan at infrasonic depth, vibrating bones first, eardrums second. The limb under the floor thrashes, trying to re-establish line of sight.

I shoulder the door open and sprint into night.

Wind knocks me sideways‚Äîhurricane-force, yet the anemometer cup I pass spins lazily, wrong physics. Black rain peppers my jacket, sizzling holes through nylon. Where droplets hit skin, they raise weeping welts. I drag my sleeve across cheek, smear oily streaks.

Lightning forks ground-ward in¬†*slow motion,*¬†each branch moving like a sewer centipede feeling for purchase. Every strike leaf after-glow filament that crawl back up the path, reverse-lancing skyward to feed the hungering core.

The tower behind me groans, bereft of its electrical blood. The entity slackens‚Äîthe violet beacon dying green, then red, then nothing. It bellows rage, a sub-bass concussion that flaps my coat like canvas. Tendrils release, whiplashing free. One slices a guy wire; the steel whip whistles across mud, decapitates a palmetto, buries itself smoking in loam three yards from my path.

I veer, half-blind, toward the tree line where an old civil-defense bunker squats, forgotten since nuclear-raid drills of Eisenhower days. The access hatch is eighty yards through sawgrass and ankle-deep mire.

Behind me the tower‚Äôs mast bows‚Äîtop segment folding as tendrils yank. Steel lattice screams, snapping bracket welds. The whole superstructure tilts toward the Gulf, hurling loose insulators in parabolic arcs that splash molten into the rain.

County tornado sirens, three miles inland, awaken‚Äî*but on DC power, cycling wrong notes.*¬†Their warble climbs past human hearing, Doppler‚Äôd by shredded wind into banshee keening. Each siren tower flickers strobe red-white-red, as though scanning for living heat.

Marsh grass around me combusts soundlessly: black raindrops turning blades to carbon lace. The air tastes like hot pennies. My lungs itch deep, cilia crisping.

The hatch appears‚Äîa squat steel coffin lid half buried under vines. I skid to kneel, palms leaving skin on the rust-covered handle. It will not budge. Lock pins seized by sixty years of salt.

Lightning overhead coagulates into a single lance; the entity condenses, all tendrils withdrawn into a meat-meteor descending point-first. I feel its gravitational intent in organs‚Äîkidneys sliding upward, stomach falling, a wrong tilt of physics.

I yank the bolt-cutters holstered on my belt‚Äîtower work habit‚Äîand snap the padlock. The shackle disintegrates in my scorched grip. I heave the lid. Hinges scream but give.

Sulfur lamp glow from my pocket lantern slices the bunker ladder. I dive, slam hatch after me just as thunder halts mid-rumble‚Äîaudio tape paused.

Through six inches of poured concrete the explosion is mute, but pressure ripples compress air hard enough to crack my eardrums. Dust mushrooms off cinderblock walls in grey puffs. I huddle in a fetal cradle under the defunct radiation-meter panel, lantern jitter-shadowing dials that all point thirteen o‚Äôclock.

The entity‚Äôs roar modulates into something else‚Äîa keening uncertainty. Denied its broadcast umbilical, it thrashes skyward again. Atmospheric pressure flips; a distant¬†*whump*¬†pops vents in the hatch above, sucking air upward. Then nothing but drizzle pattering metal.

Lantern light shows blistered hands‚Äîfingertips split, nails blackened. A runnel of blood dries across chin from the tongue-bite. My heel wound‚Äîcoffee-mug glass‚Äîhas soaked sock scarlet. The copper taste lingers like a penny glued to palate.

Sirens above lapse one by one, power starved. In their absences crickets dare a chirp‚Äîthen silence claims even them. The only sound is bunker ventilation wheezing like asthmatic bellows.

**‚Ä¶**

I fumble for my phone‚Äîmiraculously still dry inside my jacket. The screen splutters to life at minimum brightness:¬†**2 %**. No bars, then one, then a ghost of ‚ÄúLTE,‚Äù like a rescue flare that can‚Äôt make up its mind.

I huddle beneath the cracked civil-defense meter, slide my back down the wall until soggy boots splay in front of me. Blisters scream, but the pain is human and therefore reassuring. I thumb in my pattern lock; the screen‚Äôs oily glass sticks to burned fingerprints.

Air above the hatch booms‚Äîsomething heavy dragging itself in furious circles‚Äîbut down here the only noise is my ragged breath and the tick of raindrops sizzling on steel overhead. I open Reddit, start typing. Autocorrect can‚Äôt parse half the placenames or profanity, but it hardly matters; this write-up isn‚Äôt going to an editor.

I copy-paste GPS coordinates, tack on the call-sign¬†**WXCR-980**, tag every emergency-services handle I can guess.¬†*Maybe a bot still watches the firehose.*¬†The cursor lags, battery warning pops up:¬†**‚ÄúLow Power Mode?‚Äù**¬†I jab¬†*Yes*¬†and keep going, thumbs skating over spider-web cracks.

A triple-tone EAS header chirps from the speaker, soft but unmistakable. The phone isn‚Äôt tuned to any broadcast, yet the tones play anyway‚Äîoff-key, like a flute carved from bone. After the tones, text auto-fills the screen without my input:

**LIVE MANUAL OVERRIDE OR ABSORPTION**

I smash volume down, but the message re-appears in the text field, shoving aside my draft. The phone vibrates‚Äîa haptic Morse that syncs with the thunder loops outside. For a second I consider throwing the device against the wall, but it‚Äôs my only keyhole to the surface.

Instead, I type over the glyphs, overwrite every line with one frantic plea:¬†**‚ÄúDO NOT RESPOND TO UNSANCTIONED ALERTS. KILL YOUR TRANSMITTERS. SILENCE SAVES.‚Äù**

The LTE indicator flickers, clings to life. I copy everything into a new post, paste the same warning until the buffer chokes.

One bar.¬†*Send failure.*¬†I raise the phone toward the ventilation shaft where violet glow seeps like swamp-gas. Second try‚Äîprogress wheel crawls. The entity overhead bellows, concrete dust raining from the ceiling.¬†*Third try.*

A single¬†**whoosh**‚Äîthe notification sound I‚Äôve heard a thousand times‚Äîechoes impossibly loud in the bunker. The progress wheel spins itself to completion.¬†*Posted.*¬†Somewhere beyond this coffin, packets hop towers, traverse fiber, find servers I pray still breathe.

The screen dims to ember glow.¬†**1 %**. I thumb out a final line beneath the post:

*Battery dying. I‚Äôm staying radio silent. If you read this, pass it on‚Äîcut the signal before it speaks through you.*

I don‚Äôt hit Send; auto-upload flicks it into the cloud just before the screen goes black. In the sudden dark I hear only the bunker‚Äôs asthmatic ventilation and the distant, frustrated screech of something colossal denied its throat.

I lay the phone on my chest like a spent flare. Maybe rescue crews will triangulate the last ping; maybe no one will. Either way, the message is out, traveling at light-speed while I curl in analog dark, alive by definition only.

Above, the sirens stutter and expire. The crawlspace settles into a hush so total my pulse sounds like footsteps. But for now‚Äî*for now*‚Äîthe Emergency Alert System is quiet, and I am still breathing.",1,1750463633.0,PuresNightmares,0,1.0,False

I just ordered my own set of groceries after doing spark today, simply because I did not want to be in the store any longer in this 105 degree heat.


I do live in an apartment, but a fourplex with all the doors on the outside easily accessible from the parking lot. I gave a good tip because I know how it is, I know how important they are. I also live on the bottom apartment so no stairs.

This guy fucked around with my whole order, ""item not found"" ""oh oops found it!"" For at least 5 different items. (18 items total) Which whatever, fine I guess.

I gave VERY clear instructions on which apartment was mine, because I appreciate clear notes about where the apartment is. This guy sat outside my apartment for a few minutes, which I also get, because the app sucks. 

I very much doubt he could read the damn instructions, considering he did not speak English. How do I know? Because this guy went upstairs first, down to the other apartment, and finally when I got my shoes on to go outside* (accidentally typed downstairs lol), he finally got to my apartment and shoved my groceries in my hands, and took a picture of my feet as the picture. He said in very broken English thank you. (ABSOLUTELY NOT DOGGING MULTILINGUAL PEOPLE BECAUSE THATS HARD TO DO). 

I finally get my groceries (some cold items) out of the heat, and shit was thawed. No cold bag for the heat? There was a package of sauce cups absolutely wrecked in the bag. I ordered the bakery iced lemon loafs and they were fuckin sideways packed in with my cold brew coffee??? Crumbled to shit. 

Needless to say that was friggin frustrating.

1lgiqh9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lgiqh9,Post Banff Full Itinerary Details. 10/10,"I recently traveled to Banff from June 12-15 and here is everything we did from hotel, parking, hiking, eating, proposing etc. 10/10 experience from the itinerary. Wouldn‚Äôt change anything we did. Feel free to ask any questions. 

Getting to Banff:
We were supposed to get into Calgary on the evening of June 11th. Due to weather we were stuck in Denver overnight. We got to Calgary around 12pm on the 12th. We had a reservation set up with Avis‚Ä¶ this was an entire nightmare in itself. Long story short we left the airport at 2pm after the terrible lines and confusion from Avis. We stopped at the grocery store, grabbed 4 gallons of water, bread, peanut butter and jelly. Made it to Banff around 3:30pm. 

Hotel:
10/10
We stayed at the Banff Inn. We booked the hotel in November 2024. Cant recommend the hotel enough. We were in Banff to hike and explore, we needed a quiet/nice place to sleep and the Banff Inn delivered. We were within walking distance of everything downtown (even after hiking all day)

First Night:
We walked over to the visitor center and learned more about what routes to take at Moraine Lake and Lake Louise to make most of the trip. We then walked over to Backtrax and rented bear spray (around $20 USD for the trip)? Then drive over to the Banff gondola (we purchased two weeks before) to ride up an hour before we ate at Sky Bistro (reserved about 3 1/2 weeks before). I proposed around the boardwalk area which was great evening in itself!! 
(If we had this day as a full day we would‚Äôve done c-level cirque trail) 

Second Day - Moraine Lake:
Woke up at 5am to leave and drive to our pick up spot at Lake Moraine shuttle company for 6:20 ride to the lake. Booked maybe a month before. Super easy, quiet drive. No issues with shuttle. Got to the lake, walked to rock pile while nobody was around then did shoreline trail to the large stream. After we started our hike to Eiffel lake trail. At the cut off, we heard there was a momma grizzly and two cubs on the sentinel pass switchbacks towards larch valley trail. We walked over and it was the greatest thing we‚Äôve ever seen. From a safe distance the momma grizzly and two cubs slowly coming down the mountain. We headed back and then trekked over to Eiffel lake. We were stopped right before we saw the lake due to uneasy snow. We did not have crampons. We headed back ate one of our many pb&js then hiked for 40 minutes towards consolation lake before heading back to the shuttle for our 2:55pm pick up time. Again no issues. About 10ish miles total. Made it back to downtown around 4:15, walked around downtown and ate at Lupe Italian (10/10).

Third Day - Lake Louise:
Woke up at 5am and drove at 5:15 to park at Lake Louise. Arrived at 6 with 50% of the parking lot full (this is a Saturday). Absolutely no issue with parking. Took pictures at shoreline before starting our hike to lake Agnes tea house. Made it at 7:40, we were 3rd to sit down when it opened around 8:15. 10/10 experience. Continued to little beehive overlook, then trekked towards big beehive overlook. After, we ate our pb&j then headed towards plain of six glaciers. We called it a day before the turn to continue towards plain of six glaciers on the high line trail. About 9.8 miles total. We got back to the car and drove back to Banff, made it around 3:30pm. Returned our bear spray, got ice cream at Cows and ate dinner at Zyka. We had reservations at the Bison but wanted a more chill/less expensive meal. Such a good decision. 

Fourth day: 
Woke up at 7am, started driving at 7:30 to Calgary. Stopped in Canmore for coffee. Dropped off the car at 9:15am for 9:30 drop off time and left Calgary around 11. We were not aware you had to do customs while still in Canada. Still no issue with boarding.",40,1750463433.0,Banff,6,0.94,False

1lginz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEET/comments/1lginz5/how_to_unfukk_your_life_with_baby_steps/,How to unfukk your life with baby steps,"There are 2 categories of things that determine your life;

1) Things that you CAN'T change  - height, bone structure, shoe size, IQ, sex, pigmentation/race, facial structure, genetic conditions, etc. And;

2) Things that you CAN change - fitness, grooming, style, psychology, knowledge, skills.

Financials are a 50/50 gray area - You can obviously improve them but they are highly determined by the socio-economic class that you are born into. You CAN NOT become a billionaire if you are not part of the club, but you can become a low-level millionaire, which is more than enough for the average person.

  
You just have to focus on the things that you CAN change and accept the things that you CAN'T change - life isn't fair, you just have to play the cards that you are dealt.

  
Firstly you have to understand that routine is EVERYTHING, and I do mean EVERYTHING, your routine completely determines your life (other than the things in the first category). Routine is what makes the difference between successful people and losers. There is no easy or quick fix for being in the bottom of the barrel, you have to change your lifestyle (routine) and it will take a while. 

  
There are many reasons why people 'let themselves go', but it boils down to lack of motivation/depression, and 99.9% of people who are depressed are depressed because their life sucks, not because of some kind of 'chemical imbalance'. 

The good news is that you can unfukk your life to a very high degree by focusing on the things that you CAN change, and these things are pretty obvious and normal for most people, but for antisocial NEETs who have given up on life these things seem hard to do. The reason is because as a depressed NEET, everything seems overwhelming, even the smallest of things like getting up from bed. 

In order to unfukk your life you have to take baby steps and not do anything overwhelming, and everything will eventually become easy. So we will start with the absolute easiest steps to take, and if you follow these steps for a month your life will already become 30% unfukked, and if you can keep it up for half a year your life will become completely unfukked. Everything I tell you are baby steps that will not be overwhelming to you no matter how depressed you are - so what is the absolute easiest thing to do for a NEET to improve their life? 

I have compiled 11 simple things to do within one month (30 days) to unfukk your life, if you do every step within a month your life will become 1/3rd better, and if you keep it up for half a year (6 months) then you will become a civilized person with a life.

All you have to do is complete these 11 things within 1 month, so you can take your time, starting with the easiest to the hardest. Once you have completed this, you have to make it your routine and keep it up for at least 6 months, after that it becomes automatic. 

  
1) brush your teeth (do this at least every other day or chew gum every day)

2) shave your face/neckbeard (do this at least every 3-4 days)

3) shave your crotch, butthole, armpits, shoulders (do this once a month)

4) shave your hair - this is probably psychologically hard to do because a lot of people are invested in their hair, but you should just get a buzz cut a not worry about hair for a couple of months. When you have your shit together you can start thinking about a proper haircut but for starters its easier to manage just getting a buzz/soldiers cut.

5) wash your crotch, feet, butthole, armpits at least every other day (obviously change your socks, underwear, shirt after that). You don't even have to take a full shower, just wash the vital areas.

6) give up sugar completely - sugar is the most unhealthy thing you can consume, worse than alcohol and cigarettes, but it is surprisingly easy to quit cold turkey, the sugar cravings will be gone within a couple of weeks and they will NEVER return. Life without sugar is not only possible but extremely easy once the cravings are gone.

7) get basic home workout equipment - adjustable dumbbells, running clothes, a mat for doing abs, + find a nice place to run and/or outdoor gym. You DO NOT need to join a gym, it is much easier/manageable to do your workouts at home in your own time. 

8) create a very easy, simple to follow home workout routine that is not overwhelming - the easier it is the better, because if it becomes overwhelming you will give it up completely. a simple 15 minute workout per day is  good enough for starters.

9) create a workout routine that is easy but covers a full body workout or at least the most vital areas - abs (core), biceps, shoulders, chest. DO NOT overwhelm yourself, do only one muscle group per day no more than 15 minutes. Something that you can do in your coffee break, it will add up over time.

10) add some cardio, cardio is the best thing that you can do for your health, it also helps you lose weight but you should not consider cardio as the catalyst for losing weight/getting in shape - for that you need to build muscle. I would recommend running 15-20KM per week, at your own pace and time of choosing.

11) Use at least 1 hour of screen time for productive things. I spend most of my time watching YT, playing games, chatting, or watching movies/series, but you should use at least one of screen time for productive things - sending job applications, learning a skill (mostly computer stuff like AI, video editing, etc), learning a language, etc... don't simply procrastinate all day.

If you can keep up this routine for 1 month your life will become significantly less fukked, and if you can keep it up for half a year then you might actually have a chance at real life. ",1,1750463236.0,NEET,9,0.55,False

He's been to jail several times for drunk driving and once  for punching a guy at a bar while he was drunk. 

He somehow has managed to keep a job at Macdonalds he got 6 months ago. He lives with Molly because his parents cut him off after he refused to go to rehab. He uses all of his money on buying beer and doesn't save a dime. 

Molly and him met in highschool. He was semi good looking and Molly asked him out. He was a senior and she was a sophomore. They've been together ever since. 

I knew he was a drunk and didn't fully support the relationship, but he wasn't abusive and Molly seemed happy so I let it go. I knew it was no use trying to convince her he wasn't going to change. Well after the events of yesterday I'm not just going to let it go anymore.

Yesterday afternoon I went to go hang out with Molly at her house (she inherited it incase you were wondering how she could afford it). And of course Trevor was sitting in the living room, drunk as hell. I went into the kitchen to see Molly eating some lunch. 

After about an hour of us just talking in the kitchen we hear Trevor yell from the living room. We run in there to see he somehow set the small coffee table on fire. Not the whole thing just a corner of it. Molly ran into the kitchen and grabbed the fire extinguisher and put it out.

After it was out I yelled at Molly about how if she doesn't break up with Trevor he's going to end up getting her hurt or worse. She yelled back that it was just an accident and it would never happen again. I told her that she couldn't be sure. We argued back and forth for 10 minutes before I left.

She texted me a few hours later trying to apologize and saying I was an asshole for talking about her boyfriend like that. I didn't answer any of them and I don't know what to do.

1lgil34,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftRecommendations/comments/1lgil34/what_you_should_know_about_gifting_etiquette/,What you Should Know About Gifting Etiquette,"Gift-giving can feel a little stressful sometimes. As it‚Äôs not just about choosing a nice present-there‚Äôs a whole unspoken set of ‚Äúetiquette‚Äù that can actually have a big impact, whether positive or negative. Be it for a birthday, wedding, holiday, or even corporate gifts, key is knowing when and how to give a gift, that can help avoid awkward situations.

Here are a few simple gifting etiquette things I‚Äôve adopted:

* **Never show up empty-handed to a host‚Äôs home-** Even if it's not a full-on gift , something small such as flowers or dessert, is a thoughtful way to say ‚Äúthank you for having me.‚Äù
* **If you're giving a gift in a group setting, consider how it‚Äôll make others feel-** Well,  we all have different bond with friends, relatives or  colleagues but giving a super personal or expensive gift in a group setting can unintentionally create awkwardness.
* **Always include a handwritten note or card-** Even a short note or simple message adds meaning, sometimes the words matter more than the gift itself.
* **Don‚Äôt give overly personal gifts in professional settings-** Just keep it neutral and useful such as a good pen, nice coffee, or a gift card. Avoid things like perfume or clothes.
* **Be mindful of cultural norms- I**n some cultures, giving sharp objects like knives is considered bad luck. In my culture, for example, we avoid giving black-coloured items or perfumes. In others, gifts are opened later, not in front of the giver. It's always good to follow these customs and respect cultural differences.

Also think about things like: should you give the gift before or after the event? How should it be wrapped so that it feels special but not over the top?  Should it be a surprise or expected. And is a card always needed?

I‚Äôd love to hear any gifting etiquettes or personal gifting ""rules"" you follow. Have you ever been in an awkward sitiation that taught you something the hard way?",1,1750463007.0,GiftRecommendations,0,1.0,False

(Feel Free To Upvote and Share and Comment If You Want. üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüî•üî•üî•.)

Yo, I‚Äôm back after like a week been caught up with stuff but I cooked up some characters in Roblox Studio while I was gone. One of ‚Äôem happens to be a communist, BUT CHILL that ain‚Äôt me. I made √Ångel a commie, not myself. I don‚Äôt roll like that, alright? Just putting that out there before anyone gets weird. Anyway, check out the squad and their description of them:

****Hassan ""Big H"" Johnson****

Hassan is the kind of man who walks into a room and owns it ‚Äî not just with size (6‚Äô3‚Äù, built like a brawler), but with presence. Charismatic, violent, and dangerously ambitious, he runs the Crimson Set with a mix of cold logic and hood loyalty. He grew up under his older brother Elijah's shadow but made his own mark in blood and money. Hassan doesn‚Äôt just want cash ‚Äî he wants power, and he‚Äôs smart enough to build an empire from the ground up. He rocks gold chains and vintage shades, talks big, hits harder, and never forgives betrayal. You ride with him, or you better duck when the bullets fly. (Hassan‚Äôs not really new I actually came up with him like two years ago, lol.)

****Santiago ‚ÄúEl Silencio‚Äù Hern√°ndez****

The quiet one ‚Äî but deadly. Santiago grew up in the chaos of Michoac√°n, raised around guns and grim codes. Now, in the U.S., he works in the shadows, loyal to Hassan because of a shared bond earned through bloodshed. He doesn‚Äôt talk much, but when he does, it‚Äôs serious. He believes in old-school values ‚Äî family, loyalty, respect ‚Äî and doesn‚Äôt play with snitches or cowards. He always prays before moving, and watches everything. If Hassan is the king, then Santiago is the ghost that keeps enemies in check without making a sound.

****Lana ‚ÄúGunz‚Äù Cortez****

Lana‚Äôs the muscle with brains ‚Äî tactical, efficient, and ruthless. She‚Äôs not just a shooter; she‚Äôs a logistics queen and frontline leader who can hold her own with the hardest men in the Set. She grew up in Vice Hood too, built from pain and survival. Her style is no-nonsense: combat boots, tactical pants, and that crimson tank top like a war flag. She has a chip on her shoulder, a sharp tongue, and zero tolerance for weakness. Some say she‚Äôs got a soft spot for Hassan ‚Äî not that she‚Äôd ever admit it. In her world, emotions are a liability.

****Trey ‚ÄúNumbers‚Äù Watson****

The brain behind the money. Trey‚Äôs paranoid, twitchy, and cracked from years of stress and substances ‚Äî but he‚Äôs brilliant with numbers, crypto, and laundering dirty cash clean. If there‚Äôs a paper trail, he‚Äôll burn it. If there‚Äôs a wallet address, he‚Äôll ghost it. He lives holed up in a tech cave, surrounded by screens, flash drives, and coffee-stained ledgers. Hassan trusts him because Trey never steals, never lies ‚Äî he just wants to be useful and left alone. He‚Äôs the type who might mutter conspiracy theories about banks at 3 a.m. while sipping cold coffee and cooking the next crypto flip.

****√Ångel Rafael Morales (‚ÄúRed Hand‚Äù)****

The mad chemist. √Ångel is a Cuban revolutionary turned meth lord, shirtless in a shipping container, bumping old Latin songs while cooking up the purest street drugs in the city. He‚Äôs wild, charismatic, and deeply paranoid. Burn marks and scars cover his arms ‚Äî badges of a life lived around fire and acid. He rants about capitalism while selling poison, believes he‚Äôs ‚Äúfighting the system,‚Äù and sometimes keeps a Soviet flag hanging near the lab just for the drama. He‚Äôs unpredictable, manipulative, and philosophical ‚Äî a street philosopher with chemicals in one hand and revolution on his tongue.

I'm gonna be using bold text and the abbreviation **H for the host** and T for Thekla in regular text. Translation probably wont be 100% correct but I did my best. 

T: Hi, my name is Thekla. Some people call me the Toxic Spider and I am a professional wrestler in the US.

**Intro: Just a few years ago, you could regularly see the Viennese Thekla Kaischauri, alias Thekla The Toxic Spider, wrestling at underground wrestling shows. Recently, Thekla was signed by All Elite Wrestling, one of the biggest wrestling promotions in the world. Now she wrestles in front of thousands of spectators in large halls in the US in shows that reach over a million people in total. Daniel Grabner talks to Thekla The Toxic Spider about life as a professional wrestler in the US and how the St. P√∂lten youth association has to do with her career.**

H: Thekla Kaischauri alias Thekla The Toxic Spider. It's great that we managed to do this interview. Hello.

T: Hi, hello.

**H: Hey Thekla, you are a professional wrestler and recently you were signed by the second biggest promotion in the world, namely All Elite Wrestling in the US. That makes you the most successful female wrestler from Austria so far. Congratulations.**

T: Thank you. I'm happy too. 

**H: Do you ever ask yourself ""How did I get here?"" or does all of this fit into some plan you have?**

T: Yes and no. Actually, I think the plan has always been to do this, but on the other hand, I never knew how this would come about, but I often wake up and think to myself how did I manage this? I went from the basement in the Vienna underground and now I'm here and I look over at the palm trees and the swimming pools of Arizona, so I can't complain.

**H: You've already had two fights in the US, thousands of people in the arena are watching you. What was it like when you heard your entrance music for the first time in the US and walked into the arena?**

T: It's a crazy feeling because I can still remember when AEW was founded years ago, we watched it here in Vienna on the couch and I said in a few years I'll be there too, right, so I always remembered that and I thought about that in the ring too, like, OK, there we go, I made it, mom, I made it.

**H: So, what kind of feelings do you get? Are you nervous, do you have a racing heart, are you completely cool and just happy or what?**

T: I was nervous. Nervous, but just before I went out, that's when I did my little rituals and fight mode and then I was fully focused on what I had to do. So, you have to turn off at some point and just go full speed.

**H: Until recently, you were still living in Japan and were with the Stardom promotion. How did the deal with AEW come together?**

T: Yes, I was. I was in Japan for 5 years before I came to the US at the beginning of May. The last 3 years I was with Stardom and especially the last year, I was there, so authority was never easy for me, I fought a little bit against Japanese structures in wrestling and in general in the culture, and that resulted in me being fired from the company, and then I packed my bags and accepted the consequences and I always had my eyes on the US anyway, so I thought, well, let's crash over there, it's gonna work out, let's go.

**H: So what I see, when I look at the US compared to another big promotion like WWE, is that AEW is a bit more progressive, a bit more indie, a bit more technical, and what I hear is that the athletes also have a bit more say in it. Was that also a deciding factor?**

T: That's definitely a factor. I mean, I'm a bit of a hothead, and I have to do things the way I imagine them. Of course, WWE is the biggest company in the world and has an insane, insane reputation and some of the best wrestlers in the world. AEW is just fresh, new, a little bit chaotic, but a lot more creative and self-determined and that's something for me. I can come in with my ideas and say, ""Hey, I'm me, I'm me, and you can't even change my name."" And the music is just great, so that's something I like, and the chaos, yes, that's something you have to accept and then help shape, so that's just, I'm Miss Chaos anyway.

**H: Comparing Japan to the US, how is wrestling different in the US, where are the differences?**

T: So the audience. I would say the biggest, biggest difference is in Japan, they're already much more relaxed, but also more excited and concentrated when watching, not as loud, not as drunk as the Americans. But what I like, so I remember American crowds more like the Weberknecht (night club in Vienna), great and and loud and so I, for me, it's when I'm in the ring and when I hear the audience and when I feel the energy, that gives me something in the ring, and that was especially difficult in Japan during the Corona times, when they were so quiet, you don't even feel the people, that's not that easy as a performer in the middle of the ring. In the US, it's fun, everyone's loud and having fun.

**H: Much more involved.**

T: Yes, exactly. In Japan they're much more respectful, they look at everything very closely, they don't miss anything, and they're also easily impressed. Japan, it was great, I don't want to miss Japan at all, and the audience is crazy. They'll put you on a pedestal. So, you're really celebrated as a cult figure, and that's an interesting experience.

**H: Well, I guess that's going to be the case in the US, too, soon. Would you say that it was a big culture clash to move, from living in Japan to now Arizona?**

T: Ah, my Tokyo apartment. I had my last match on the 27th of April and I moved out in the morning and the apartment was still the same as before and then in the evening I started packing and we completely cleared out the apartment and then on the 28th I gave the keys back and then I moved into a hotel for 3 days and said goodbye to everyone and then I went straight to the US to a completely empty apartment, which is still completely empty right now. When we are on tour so much and I actually haven't had time to buy furniture yet. But otherwise it's cool. Yeah, it's crazy, but it's the wrestling life - everything is crazy, you never get to rest and the tour life is a never-ending rollercoaster anyway. So, Culture Clash, yeah, but I think it's cool anyway. It's fun.

**H: What will be the first piece of furniture you will buy for the new apartment?**

T: I want a fat, cool couch. It's like a 70s Brazilian leather couch in Scarlet Red, that's what I imagine, and then I'll buy a cool glass table that's too expensive. But that's it, I won't buy anything else.

**H: Can you then fly through the glass table, or what?**

T: Well, yeah, so like the way we throw parties here, that's what it's for.

**H: We've already talked about it a little bit before. In Japan you designed your outfits. How much influence do you have now in the US on formal things like outfits and music?**

T: In Japan, I designed all my stuff myself, all of it. I have all the drawings I made at home for all the outfits you see. Even what you see here in the US, I designed all of it myself.

**H: Is that all still by you?**

T: Yeah, yeah, it's all me, not cut by me, but I drew all of it myself. It's all my concept.

**H: And the music?**

T: The music is based on my, on my old song, and I wrote that myself with my former bassists, and I also play guitar and so on. And then the new song, they said, well, we would like to do that, it's about rights and copyrights and so on, and I said, well, OK, but I want it to be, so if Thekla is not bellowed, then I don't want it, yes, so it should be like that, so if you know the song, Theklaaaaaa and so on.  I said, I want it to be similar and then a little bit like Rammstein elements and so on, and make it fat and aggressive and then they said, well, the guy who wrote it, we were on the same page, so, yes, it's going to be fat, it's going to be cool and then he took everything I told him to heart and in one or two days he put it all together. So and I am super happy, I think it's really cool, I think it's mega cool.

**H: yes I heard it and I thought, wow, it sounds, it sounds even harder, more simple than the one before and I wondered, will Thekla Toxic Spider now be even more evil, more heel?**

T: Yeah, yeah, actually. So I'm from music, so entrance music is really important to me. If it's just like, you know, it's just kind of there or it's just badly produced, then it actually affects how I move and work in the ring and my confidence and when I heard the song, just the way it starts, just like it's just straight to the point, like, you know, really cool and and and. I just became more aggressive, you know, so I think it actually has a pretty big influence.

**H: And professional wrestling is a full-time job. Can you tell me a little bit about your daily routine or your weekly routine, especially when you're on tour, for example?**

T: Yeah, a workday is like I fly there the day before, for example, to Portland, then I wake up at 7 in the morning, have a coffee, straight to the gym, first half an hour to an hour training, then I get on the bus and prepare at the venue, train a little bit more in the ring, then makeup, hair and then into the costume and off we go. Then the next day, early in the morning, back to flying either hungover or not hungover, depending on what's planned the next day and then yesterday I woke up at 8 in the morning, went straight down to the gym, trained some more, went to the sauna, had a quick bite to eat and then I drove to the wrestling school here in Arizona and got beaten up for 3 hours, and of course, I beat them up too, and then I had a big steak because that's rich here and then I gave some interviews and and and. That's, that's my life.

**H: So, there's actually no off day or because you have to train every day, gym or wrestle yourself.**

T: So wrestling, I have to take care of my body, I do that maximum twice, plus of course the match. So I'm in the ring three times a week, I would say and gym every day, except sometimes I give myself a rest day, but most of the time, rest day is cardio, so I still run or at least get 10,000 steps in, but I train every day, yes.

**H: And, of course, in professional wrestling, you're not immune to pain from your opponents' strikes or holds. How do you deal with that, and what's been your worst injury so far?**

T: Now that I'm actually in the upper echelon, I'm like, OK, I'm going to invest in chiropractors and get myself realigned and massaged. And luckily, AEW has a great medical team. So before the matches, I get my neck and my back and everything realigned. And injuries. Yes, of course, that's part of it. Unfortunately, I have issues with my neck sometimes. I've had herniated discs in my neck. Yes, a few times. The longest I was out of the game was, I think, four months, which isn't so bad. And yes, last year, I broke my hand, but it healed really quickly, and I had a cast, and I was able to use that in the ring as a weapon, because it's a great weapon. So yes, not every injury is automatically a bad thing, you just have to always think outside the box, and with a cast, you have to imagine hitting someone with a cast, and it's a great feeling when you do that.

**H: Yes, I have to try that.**

T: Yeah, you have to.

**H: You did study at the Applied and the Artistic in Vienna, graduated from the Applied in 2020, and your thesis was, if I remember correctly, a performance called Office Girl.**

T: That's true.

**H: You threw yourself through office furniture in office attire, does taking on such roles actually have a certain appeal for you?**

T: Yes, actually, of course yes. So, Office Girl is about using small tricks in the office to get to the top of the office society, so a totally absurd concept for a story, but yes, Office Girl is also part of me, so for all my work, I have to, I often have to just sit down and do really boring work, that's also part of it. And yes, this character is somehow part of me and I also lived that out there and made fun of it at the same time and wrote it into a story that I tried to address many people with, who might feel the same way, who feel cheated by the middle class and at the same time are totally part of it, yes. 

**H: Stuck in bullshit jobs.**

T: Full, full and And that's all of us at some point, yes or or still are and and as a wrestler, that's just the complete opposite, so that's where I get to live out my my sadistic urges and my masochistic urges, yes, so and can just be badass of the world, fighting my way through the world, which is what I don't do 24/7, yes.Only 20/7

**H: I was going to ask, how much Thekla Kaischauri is in Thekla the Toxic Spider and vice versa?**

T: Oh boy. Actually, So these things are already so, so fuzzy, I can't read them anymore, I don't know who's who anymore.It's very dangerous, very dangerous for me and for the environment, but yes, a lot. One influences the other, so my art. I started painting again and exhibiting again. And of course, my art is totally influenced by my work as a wrestler and what I do in the ring is very influenced by my designs, so you can see that in my costumes, in my music, in the way I move, it's all very, very creative, very artistic, I would say, compared to maybe other wrestlers.

**H: Yes, and it's so beautiful because it's also a multimedia project, or?**

T: Yes, so if if you look at it from the art point of view, if you want to look at it, then it would be a very long-term performance art piece.Ja if if if you wanted to, but but I would never describe it like that myself.

**H: Thekla is your first name, Thekla is also the spider in ""The Adventures of Maya the Bee,"" was that an inspiration for this gimmick?**

T: Yes, because Thekla is a very, very rare name, and I was already confronted in my early childhood with the fact that children were very irritated by my name and always said: What's that for a name? Ah, like the spider from Maya the Bee. That's just how it was, that was the only thing they could relate to, and so I was always the spider, even as a child, and then my hyperflexibility came into play. It's just something that's innate in me, that I'm very flexible. Then I combined that with this and that, and my fighting style is, well, my basics in grappling are very aggressive, so I start very slowly and thoughtfully and observantly, and then very impulsively and quickly, so if I want to choke someone, then it happens in an instant, like a spider that jumps on them and bites and doesn't let go.

**H: That's also very impressive how the gimmick, this spider, is reflected in you. In all the moves you have and what you just told us about how you became Thekla The Toxic Spider, that sounded to me like the classic genesis of a super villain, so society made you into one, and then you had a talent for it, and that's how this human became this super villain, so to speak.**

T: That's true. The kids who always bullied me in St. P√∂lten are still to blame for the fact that I'm now wreaking havoc in the US and worldwide, so thank you, St. P√∂lten.

**H: So St. P√∂lten is at least good for something. Exactly. For all of you who live in Austria and are listening to us now, thinking how cool it is, and you want to become a wrestler, what tips do you have for them?**

T: Go immediately to the WSA Wrestling School Austria and train with Humungus, my coach, my ultimate wrestling coach, and do it. That's my first tip. My second tip is: Stay at home, it hurts like hell. Don't do it (laughs). Yes, it's very fun. And it's a great discipline. If you want to try it, then do it. And the cool thing is, you can travel a lot and people think it's cool. It hurts like hell, but it pays off in the end of the day.

**H: You mentioned one, the Humungus, your first coach. Who would you say has been a significant influence on your journey, which people have influenced you?**

T: Shoutout to Mike from DeeCracks for sure. I would say he's my first and most loyal fan from day one, he was at my first match in Weberknecht and he was also at my last match in Japan and I have to say it's the people who say from the beginning, like he did, so like, you don't need another name, Thekla is cool, stay with Thekla and I'm still with Thekla today, I haven't even changed my name. And it's the people who say, yeah, go for it, sky's the limit, and so I need my cheerleaders too. Mike was there from the very beginning, my mom of course, she always stood in the way of wrestling, so she hates it, she still has never seen a match, she's very anti and and she watches it, so she really has no idea what I do, but. Once I started to really become successful, she was already very supportive.So she's always there, always at the forefront, when anything comes out in the media, so I can always call my mom, no mom, no life - literally. And all the coaches, all the people, even in Japan, of course.I was really well trained  and the fans, love My Fans and Thank you to Everybody, so without support, it doesn't work out and I'm really thankful in that regard.

**H: Do you miss Austria sometimes?**

T: Yes, so I, I wake up sometimes and I think, oh, I would love to have a schnitzel right now and I also like to go to Ritter, to the caf√© Ritter or so, and the Grand, so I miss the Grand, I miss Vienna, I miss taking the subway and the tram, because you can't do that in Arizona, and I don't have a driver's license, so I'm a little stuck wherever I'm dropped off, so I have to wait for someone to pick me up.

**H: Like a spider that's put out in front of the door.**

T: Yes, yes, and I have to wait for someone to come and pick me up. And yes, that gets on my nerves a little bit, but otherwise? And I think, well, in Vienna you just need a quarter of an hour to get from a to z. Yes, and it's cool and the food is great and the people are great and the beer tastes good, I miss that

**H: I can understand that. I have one more question about women in wrestling in general, they are still underrepresented in the big promotions, so in a show with several fights, there is often only one womens match, what do you think needs to happen for that to change?**

T: I find that's always difficult. On the one hand, nothing can really change if everything stays the same, because you need experience, you have to go out there and you have to do it again and again and again. Just because if there's just one women's match, then there will always be 20 women who have nothing to do and no chance to improve, yes. On the other hand, there are also, traditionally, I would say, just so many women who don't have to do much because they just look good, and that's enough, yes, and as soon as you figure that out, you get lazy really fast, or you just don't want to get your nose broken or break someone else's nose, and that's sometimes a little different with the boys. Also, I'm not putting everyone in the same box, but where I am now, when it comes to TV and so on, everyone is always fully engaged, and that's where you just need TV time. Just to learn, but of course it's important that you never rely on things that are just given to you, like your looks or sex appeal.

**H: What are your favorite moments in the ring?**

T: So what I enjoy the most is, I think, when I have my entrance and then I throw my last pose in the corner, so when I hear my music start playing and then I show off in front of all the people, that's when I feel like I'm a show-off somewhere inside me. I think that's cool when everyone's watching and thinking, ""Wow, look how cool,"" and I can feel it. So that's already a cool feeling, and then the nervousness goes away and you're really into it and you know, ""OK, now it's time to get down to business.""

**H: What would you say will change now with the new promotion? How will Thekla The Toxic Spider go on?**

T: So I have won my first two matches in AEW and I plan to keep doing that. So they should give me the next opponents and then the winning streak will continue. I will work my way up to the top of the chain and then we will have our first Austrian female superstar here in AEW.",29,1750462175.0,SquaredCircle,4,0.79,False
1lgia71,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFinanceTrending/comments/1lgia71/how_much_emergency_fund_you_really_need_in_2025/,How Much Emergency Fund You Really Need in 2025,"To be honest: The old '3 to 6 months of expenses' rule sounds safe‚Ä¶ until your rent spikes 20%, your freelance client ghosts you mid-project, or a 'mild' ER visit turns into a $4,700 bill.

What used to feel like solid advice now feels like the financial equivalent of 'just walk it off.'

In 2025, life isn‚Äôt stable. It‚Äôs agile. And your emergency fund should be too.

We‚Äôre rewriting what an emergency fund actually needs to look like - based on how people actually live, work, and panic-scroll their banking apps today.

# Why the '3 to 6 Months' Rule Doesn‚Äôt Work Anymore in 2025

**What inflation, gig work, and global instability mean for your safety net today**

If you're still planning your emergency fund like it's 2015, you're already behind.

* **Inflation is sticky** \- even if it cools on paper, real costs (rent, childcare, groceries) haven‚Äôt snapped back.
* **Gig and freelance work are surging.** In 2024, 38% of U.S. workers earned income independently (Statista), and that number‚Äôs growing.
* **Economic 'vibes' matter.** Layoffs aren‚Äôt just for tech now. Healthcare, media, and even law firms are trimming fat - fast.

The emotional math of an emergency fund has shifted: it‚Äôs not about how long you can survive - it‚Äôs how many variables you can weather at once.

Think: a sick parent, late client payment, and car repair - all in the same month.

**Are you a W2, 1099, or business owner? Emergency savings by income type**

Let‚Äôs break it down by how you earn your money:

* **W2 employee (steady paycheck):** You might still get away with 3-4 months of expenses. But only if you're in a low-layoff-risk role.
* **1099 freelancer or side-hustler:** You need more buffer. Not just for gaps in work - but to float late payments and off-season droughts.
* **Small business owner:** Your emergency fund isn‚Äôt just personal - it‚Äôs payroll, operations, and customer refunds. Double or even triple the usual advice may apply.

Real talk: If your income is unpredictable, your emergency fund has to be over-prepared. Because your bills won‚Äôt suddenly become 'freelance-friendly' when things go south.

**The new 'Minimum Viable Emergency Fund' for each U.S. income bracket (with data)**

Let‚Äôs get into real numbers.

* **Under $40K/year:** You need at least $3,500‚Äì$5,000. Why? Because the first $1,000 only covers minor emergencies - not job loss or medical debt.
* **$40K‚Äì$85K/year:** Target $8,000‚Äì$15,000. This covers rent, insurance, and food without panic-depleting your checking account.
* **$85K‚Äì$150K/year:** Start at $20,000. High earners often have high fixed costs - including student loans, kids, or mortgage.
* **$150K+ year:** You need flexibility more than a number. Build 6-9 months of essential expenses (not lifestyle inflation).

**Why your emergency fund should be dynamic, not fixed - adaptive planning in 2025**

Here‚Äôs a mindshift: Your emergency fund isn‚Äôt a fixed pot - it‚Äôs a living number.

It should flex with your rent, job security, healthcare premiums, and even your mental health bandwidth.

Examples:

* Got a roommate? You might need less.
* Just went full-time freelance? You now need more.
* Partner got laid off? You both need to recalculate.

**Build a system, not a number.** That‚Äôs how you stay recession-resistant and anxiety-proof.

# Book Insight: Your Money or Your Life by Vicki Robin (Chapter 3)

'Money is something we trade our life energy for.' In 2025, that energy is under pressure - from inflation, burnout, and unstable income. Your emergency fund isn‚Äôt just about surviving. It‚Äôs your buffer against trading your future for today‚Äôs chaos.

# How to Calculate Your Personal Emergency Fund - No Generic Formulas

The fastest way to waste your emergency fund? Copying someone else‚Äôs number.

Most advice online feels like a horoscope: 'You might need $10,000. Or maybe $25,000. Good luck!' But in 2025, where your Uber driver might earn more than your salaried friend, formulas that ignore your lifestyle are useless.

This section gives you an actual system. Not vibes. Not spreadsheets that make your eyes bleed. A system.

**Break your expenses into survival, stability, and upgrade tiers**

Forget 'monthly expenses.' That number is a blur - part groceries, part Spotify, part takeout guilt. Break it down like this:

**1. Survival tier (bare minimum)**

* Rent or mortgage
* Utilities (just what keeps the lights on)
* Groceries (real food, not lattes)
* Insurance premiums
* Debt minimums

**2. Stability tier (your real life)**

* Transportation (Uber/Lyft, gas, train pass)
* Internet + phone
* Health expenses not covered by insurance
* Childcare or dependents
* One affordable 'you' thing - therapy, gym, dog walker

**3. Upgrade tier (optional but soul-saving)**

* Subscriptions
* Dining out
* Travel, gifts, hobbies
* Investing beyond 401(k)
* Anything that keeps you sane, but not fed

Now run a 3-month or 6-month simulation based on each tier. You‚Äôll see exactly how lean or padded your emergency fund needs to be, based on your real life.

This isn't budgeting. It's prepping for worst-case-you.

**Use this 3-bucket model: Liquid, Accessible, Growth-safe**

Emergency funds don‚Äôt belong in one spot. Especially not in a 0.01% savings account that earns less than your coffee cashback.

Here‚Äôs the smarter breakdown:

**Bucket 1: Liquid (instant access)**

* 1 month of Survival-tier expenses
* Stored in a high-yield savings or money market account
* Goal: No penalty, no delay, no excuses

**Bucket 2: Accessible (1‚Äì3 day access)**

* 2‚Äì4 months of expenses
* Stored in short-term T-bills, HYSA, or no-penalty CDs
* Goal: Earn real interest while staying calm

**Bucket 3: Growth-safe (for longer emergencies)**

* Anything beyond 3‚Äì4 months
* Stored in low-volatility cash ETFs or even I-bonds
* Goal: Protect against inflation without full market risk

Each bucket has a job. Together, they give you peace of mind and actual yield.

**Real-world calculator: 4 scenarios from job loss to medical emergency**

Let‚Äôs plug this in. Assume you're 29, renting in Austin, freelancing part-time, and averaging $4,500/month income.

Here‚Äôs how different events play out:

**Scenario A: You lose your main client for 6 weeks**

* You dip into Bucket 1 and 2 - maybe $4,500
* Your rent, health insurance, and food are covered
* No credit card panic

**Scenario B: You get injured, can‚Äôt work, have a $3,000 ER bill**

* Insurance covers part, you use Bucket 1 + HSA
* Recovery time covered by Bucket 2
* You still have Bucket 3 untouched

**Scenario C: You move cities for work, need 1st and last rent + deposits**

* Bucket 3 is your relocation float
* You don‚Äôt derail investing or emergency savings

**Scenario D: Your car dies and you need $7,000 for a used one**

* Bucket 2 + 3 = handled
* Bonus: You have leverage to negotiate without stress

This is how a layered emergency fund keeps real emergencies from becoming life detours.

**Avoid this mistake: why over-saving is just financial hoarding in disguise**

Let‚Äôs address the guilt. Some of us hoard cash in the name of 'safety,' but it‚Äôs really just fear wearing a finance hat.

If your emergency fund is so big it slows down your investing, career moves, or joy‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not peace of mind - that‚Äôs stagnation.

Your goal isn't to build a bunker. It‚Äôs to buy time, clarity, and choice when life hits pause.

So once your emergency fund is solid? Redirect future money to grow, not just protect.

# Book Insight: I Will Teach You to Be Rich by Ramit Sethi (Second Edition, Chapter 4)

'There‚Äôs a limit to how much you can cut - but no limit to how much you can earn.'

Your emergency fund should protect your earning power, not box it in. Save what you need, then get back to building.

# Where to Keep Your Emergency Fund in 2025 (Without Losing Value to Inflation)

Most people don‚Äôt have a savings problem - they have a storage problem.

You could do all the math, stack your buckets, build the perfect emergency fund‚Ä¶ and then park it in a checking account earning **0.01% APY** while inflation silently eats your cash alive.

You deserve better than 'well, at least it‚Äôs safe.'

**Why traditional savings accounts are costing you money right now**

Look at it like this:

* **Inflation in 2025** is hovering between **3.2% and 4.5%**, depending on the month (source: U.S. BLS CPI data).
* Most legacy banks - think Wells Fargo, Chase, Bank of America - still offer **under 0.05% APY** on basic savings.

That means your $10,000 emergency fund loses **$320‚Äì$450 in purchasing power every year**‚Ä¶ just by sitting there.

That‚Äôs not saving. That‚Äôs slow-motion loss.

And yet, millions keep their 'emergency fund' in accounts that can‚Äôt even beat a supermarket rewards card.

**Best high-yield accounts, T-bills, and cash ETFs for 2025**

You‚Äôre not asking for miracle returns. You‚Äôre asking for safety that keeps up with reality. Here‚Äôs where to park your money smarter:

**1. High-Yield Savings Accounts (HYSAs)** Top APYs as of June 2025:

* Ally: 4.35% APY
* SoFi: 4.40% (with direct deposit)
* CIT Bank: 4.60% (conditions apply)

Perfect for your Bucket 1 money - you want it fast, you want it FDIC-insured.

**2. Treasury Bills (T-Bills)**

* 3-month and 6-month T-bills are paying \~5.1%
* Zero state tax, backed by the U.S. government
* Buy via TreasuryDirect or apps like Public and Fidelity

Great for Bucket 2 - the mid-term emergency cash that needs protection + growth.

**3. Cash ETFs** Options like **JPST (JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income)** or **BIL (iShares 1-3 Month T-Bills ETF)** are offering 4.5%‚Äì5% yields with low volatility.

* Easy to withdraw in 1‚Äì2 days
* Tax-efficient if held in brokerage
* Use for Bucket 3 - but keep some buffer for market fluctuations

Important: These aren‚Äôt investment hacks. They‚Äôre inflation-defense tools for your emergency fund - and they‚Äôre beating bank accounts by miles.

**Emergency fund vs sinking fund: where to draw the line**

This confuses people all the time - so let‚Äôs settle it:

* **Emergency fund** = Unexpected, urgent, destabilizing (Job loss, medical bill, car wreck, family crisis)
* **Sinking fund** = Expected, planned, emotionally annoying (Car maintenance, annual vet visits, new laptop, vacations)

If you‚Äôre constantly dipping into your emergency fund for things you knew were coming? That‚Äôs not an emergency fund - that‚Äôs just lazy planning.

Use a separate sinking fund with automation. That way, your emergency buffer stays pure and untouched - the way it‚Äôs meant to be.

**How to access emergency cash instantly - without early withdrawal penalties**

Speed matters. When sh\*t hits the fan, you don‚Äôt want to 'wait 5‚Äì7 business days.'

Here‚Äôs how to structure for instant liquidity:

* **Set up a linked HYSA with your checking account** \- transfers in <24 hours
* **Use apps with same-day liquidity** \- SoFi, Ally, and Capital One are best-in-class
* **Avoid lock-up products** \- No long-term CDs or anything with withdrawal penalties

Bonus tip: Use a separate debit card connected to your emergency-only account. No swiping for Postmates. No casual Venmo transfers. Just cold-glass-breaking-in-case-of-emergency money.

# Book Insight: The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel (Chapter 17: 'The Seduction of Pessimism')

'Saving is the gap between your ego and your income.'

Where you store your emergency fund says everything about how seriously you take financial peace. Don‚Äôt settle for safe. Go for smart, secure, and yield-aware. That‚Äôs 2025 thinking.

# FAQ: Real Questions About Emergency Funds in 2025

**How much emergency fund do I need as a freelancer in 2025?**

If you freelance, side hustle, or run a solo gig, the answer isn‚Äôt months - it‚Äôs modes:

* **Dry season mode:** What do you need to float a 6‚Äì8 week gap in income?
* **Ghosted client mode:** Can you cover your life while chasing unpaid invoices?
* **Emergency mode:** What‚Äôs your baseline if work halts and something breaks?

In 2025, with platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and even Substack seeing payout delays or demand dips, your **minimum emergency fund should cover 4‚Äì6 months of 'survival tier' expenses** \- and sit across 2‚Äì3 liquidity levels.

Add extra if your health insurance is out of pocket or if your work is seasonal.

Reddit realness: The most upvoted comment in r/freelance finance threads isn‚Äôt 'save more.' It‚Äôs: ""Build it like your next paycheck might ghost you.""

# Is $10,000 enough for an emergency fund today?

It depends who you are:

* **If you‚Äôre single, renting, with low fixed expenses:** $10K can cover 3‚Äì5 months comfortably.
* **If you live in a high-cost city, have dependents, or irregular income:** $10K is your starting line, not your finish line.
* **If you‚Äôve already got sinking funds + health insurance:** Then yes, $10K might be enough - for now.

But don‚Äôt treat that number like a trophy. Inflation in 2025 is stealthy - what felt solid last year might fall short next quarter.

Better question: What does $10K buy in your worst-case month? If the math doesn‚Äôt check out, the fund isn‚Äôt enough.

**Can I invest part of my emergency fund safely?**

Short answer: **Yes, but only the outer layer.**

* Your first 1‚Äì2 months of expenses? Stay liquid.
* Months 3‚Äì6? Consider low-risk, cash-equivalent assets like:
   * **T-bills**
   * **No-penalty CDs**
   * **Ultra-short bond ETFs (JPST, ICSH, BIL)**

Do **not** throw your emergency fund into stocks, crypto, or high-volatility REITs and hope 'it‚Äôll be fine.' If you can‚Äôt access it at full value when you need it, it‚Äôs not part of your emergency fund.

Smart investors in 2025 know the goal isn‚Äôt growth. It‚Äôs **preservation without erosion.**

**Should I keep my emergency fund in crypto, stablecoins, or cash?**

Crypto is many things - emergency-ready isn‚Äôt one of them.

* **Bitcoin and ETH**: Too volatile. You don‚Äôt want your safety net down 25% when life‚Äôs already on fire.
* **Stablecoins (USDC, USDT)**: Better, but still risk exposure to de-pegging, regulation, and platform hacks.
* **Cash**: Still undefeated for immediacy and certainty.

If you‚Äôre crypto-native, keep a small portion (maybe 10‚Äì15%) of your long-term buffer in stablecoins on trusted platforms, but your **core emergency fund should be in FDIC-insured, fiat-backed, easily accessible instruments**.

Real-world use test: If you needed $4,000 tomorrow, could you guarantee it with zero conversion friction or market timing stress? If not, it doesn‚Äôt belong in your emergency fund.

The first time I worked there I was called the ""afternoon shift queen"" because I would go above and beyond at my job. Eventually a person who used to work there came back, and to say she wasn't happy about that would be an understatement. After she heard all the praise I would get she went out of her way to make my job a living nightmare. She would leave extremely long lists of stuff to do for everyone, not just me While she did literally nothing her shift. One day she even went as far to frame me to get me in trouble. That was what finally drove me to put my two weeks in. I was sick and tired of having her not only leave lists but guilt trip me into making me do more just for her to complain that I didn't do it right or frame me. 

I told myself I would never go back there but recently my boss begged me to come back because she desperately needed workers and at the time my mom and I were in a really bad financial stop and that place was the only place close enough to work at. I came back and my only request was to not put me with that one lady again. Well a bit before I left they hired that ladies to work there and she was pretty much a mini version of that lady (we will call the niece C and her aunt A). I never really had to deal with C until I came back. 

C completely no showed one day for her morning shift (5am to 1pm) so they were unable to open and that made me and my friend have to come in early. I came in two hours early and my friend and hour and a half early. Normally it would be no problem but the day before she refused to show the new guy how to clean the prep table, which made my friend and I have to do it while being busy with not only costumers but also all the stuff that last shift was supposed to do but didn't. Then the next day (deep fryer cleaning day) C didn't even show up just for me to find out she got drunk the night before and woke up in someone else's bed not to mention she never gave me any form of apology. I was so annoyed. C is also friends with my friend (I'll call my friend G) so she of course apologized to her but I was the one who had to clean up her deep fryer mess again.

 The next Morning I had to clean the deep fryer and since that is normally done on Sunday the lady working register was extremely rude towards me for taking so long, let me add it takes about an hour to clean the deep fryer properly. I got it done in a good amount of time. 

At work we have a rule where whoever does the prep table and deep fryer one week doesn't do it next. Two weeks later I was put to do prep table and deep fryer again which I don't have a problem with doing but the next week I was put register morning shift on Sunday when I was working with C. My boss knew I did not know how to open morning shifts yet still made me work it so I asked G if she could tell me what to do. Technically all I had to do that I didn't already know was make tea and coffee.

 That morning I walked over to C and asked if she could tell me how to make them and she gave me a terrifying death stare and said ""well there is a lot to do over there for opening so why don't you just switch sides with me for opening."" I knew it was Sunday and that she just didn't want to clean the deep fryer and that there was literally just the two things to do to open so I stood my ground and said, ""if you just tell me I can do it no problem"" she proceeded to give me that terrifying look until I eventually backed down and said ""well if you really want till do it."" I regret saying that so much but it was early and I have already been struggling enough mentally as it is. 

I wasn't feeling well so I quickly grabbed a snack and went to the back to get the grease bucket and C followed me just to continue giving me that terrifying look. I turned to her to say ""I'm sorry I am super lightheaded right now"" before I grabbed the bucket but that didn't stop her. I went to the kitchen and put on music since we were not open yet and I started emptying the deep fryer when, again, she specifically came over just to give me that terrifying look. At this point I was so fed up and emotionally overwhelmed (from different things in my life) that I kind of shut down until my stomach started aching so bad and I have no choice but to b-line it to the bathroom. I sent her a message telling her ""I'm so sorry my stomach is super upset I'll be out as soon as I can"" to which she responded""it's ok, I'll take care of both sides, the deepfryer will be waiting."" That is what confirmed it to me that she only wanted to make me do her job. On top of that I was saying how I wonder why my boss kept putting me on register side and c said "" I don't know but she knows she can rely on me so that's why I have been in the kitchen"" along with making me feel super insecure about my friendship. I have honestly had enough at this point.

Tomorrow I am working Saturday morning shift (G showed me how to make the tea and coffee at this point) and I got a message from C saying ""hey, can we switch shifts tomorrow. My dad needs me to take him somewhere tomorrow."" Last time I checked this girl had a DUI and was not supposed to drive right now not to mention I was still and about everything so I texted her back, ""I'm sorry I am unable to do that."" It's not just the stuff I said here that she has done, there are many other things that if I added it would make this post way to long but I will say she still owes me from several different things and the one time I needed her she didn't help even though she could. My mom is telling me I'm in the wrong and that I should suck it up and just take it since I only have to deal with this until August (I start college in August) but I strongly don't think I am. I am starting to feel bad but I don't want to back down again. What do you think, AITAH?



Edit: I was just texting my friend G and she told me that C also asked if she could switch shifts with her because her dad has to go for chemo treatments and now I feel absolutely terrible it is currently 8:40 p.m. and I feel really bad because I don't want to randomly message her into the kay you know what I changed my mind I can do it for you when there's like this late in the day already I don't know what to do any advice would be greatly appreciated thank you.

Stop pouring your hard-earned Jamaican Dollars into outdated, slow, and overpriced link-building strategies. The entire landscape of digital marketing and SEO in the vibrant, hyper-competitive Jamaican market has been irrevocably altered. The days of tedious manual outreach are over. Local SEO agencies across Jamaica, from the bustling corporate centers of New Kingston to the tourism-driven hubs of Montego Bay and the commercial heart of Spanish Town, are finding it impossible to keep up with the pace of global digital change. A new era of SEO is here‚Äîone that is smarter, faster, and infinitely more effective for dominating the search engine rankings.

This is a highly sophisticated, completely automated engine built to acquire high-authority, contextually relevant backlinks at a velocity and scale that human-powered services can only fantasize about.

# The Crippling Problem with Traditional Link Building for Jamaican Businesses

For years, companies from Kingston to Montego Bay, Spanish Town to Ocho Rios, and Negril to Portmore, have been ensnared in the same unproductive and frustrating cycle. You are acutely aware that you need high-quality backlinks to rank on Google for your local customers and international tourists, but the available options have always been a frustrating trade-off between being too slow, too expensive, or dangerously risky, especially in the unique and diverse Jamaican economy.

* **The Agonizing, Soul-Crushing Grind of Manual Outreach:** This is the equivalent of digital cold-calling, and it's just as inefficient. You or your marketing team dedicate hundreds of precious hours to manually scouring the internet for potential link placement opportunities, painstakingly hunting for contact information (which is often hidden or outdated), crafting so-called ""personalized"" emails that are flagged as spam or simply ignored, and then engaging in a demoralizing, endless cycle of follow-ups. The response rate is staggeringly low, and the few links you manage to acquire are seldom worth the monumental effort. It's a process that annihilates morale and depletes critical resources for a negligible return on investment.
* **The Exorbitant, Unjustifiable Cost of SEO Agencies:** Link-building companies and digital marketing agencies in Jamaica command a premium. You can easily expect to pay anywhere from J250,000tooverJ1,000,000 per month for a standard contract that might, if you're lucky, yield 5-10 backlinks. The entire process is shrouded in mystery, a ""black box"" where you have minimal control or visibility into where your money is actually going. You're often locked into long-term commitments with flimsy guarantees and opaque reporting. In reality, you're paying for their fancy office space in New Kingston or near the Hip Strip in Montego Bay, their sales commissions, and their inefficient manual processes‚Äînot for tangible, cost-effective results.
* **The Extreme Risk of ""Affordable"" Link Schemes:** The seemingly cheaper alternative is to turn to freelance platforms or dubious online providers who promise hundreds of links for a few thousand dollars. This is not a shortcut; it's a direct route to a catastrophic Google penalty. These toxic links originate from irrelevant and penalized Private Blog Networks (PBNs), automated spammy blog comments, or even hacked websites. They might provide a fleeting, artificial bump in rankings before your website's authority, credibility, and traffic come crashing down, potentially wiping out your online presence and your business's reputation for good.

You find yourself caught in an impossible situation. You cannot afford to squander time on manual tasks, you cannot afford the outrageous fees of local agencies, and you absolutely cannot afford a Google penalty that could erase your business from the search results. So, how do you break free, compete, and ultimately win in the digital arena?

# Why AI Monster Tool is the Undisputed Champion of Link Building

Our platform represents more than just a piece of software; it's a fundamental shift in how SEO is executed. Here are the definitive reasons why smart businesses across Jamaica are embracing [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) and abandoning every other solution.

# Unparalleled Speed and Infinite Scalability

A local SEO agency might painstakingly build you 10 links in a month. With AI Monster Tool, you can build hundreds of high-quality links in the same timeframe. Our system is perpetually active, constantly identifying and securing valuable placements at a rate no human team could ever hope to achieve. Whether you need to establish authority for a new BPO firm in the Montego Bay Free Zone or supercharge a hotel on the cliffs of Negril, you can scale your link-building efforts on demand without adding a single minute to your workload. This is how you leapfrog your competition in a matter of weeks, not years.

# Radical and Immediate Cost Reduction

Stop incinerating your marketing budget on bloated agency retainers. The average cost per link acquired through an agency can easily exceed J$50,000. [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) delivers vastly superior, contextually relevant links for a tiny fraction of that cost. By eliminating the manual labor, the sales commissions, and the administrative overhead, we pass those incredible savings directly on to you. You can then reinvest that capital into other critical areas of your business, like product development or customer support, while our AI handles the complexities of global link building.

# Superior Link Quality and Contextual Relevance

In the modern era of SEO, contextual relevance is the undisputed king. A backlink from an irrelevant website is, at best, worthless and, at worst, harmful. Our AI is hard-coded to prioritize contextual relevance above all other metrics. It guarantees that your links are placed within content that is directly and thematically related to your industry, your services, and your keywords. If you run a rum distillery tour near Appleton Estate, your links will appear on global travel and spirits blogs. If you are a software developer in Kingston, your links will appear on sites discussing Caribbean tech, venture capital, and software development. These are the powerful, authority-building links that Google‚Äôs algorithm is designed to reward with higher search rankings.

Our guiding principle is ""set it and rank."" The platform is meticulously designed for maximum ease of use. You do not need to be an SEO guru with a decade of experience to achieve expert-level results. You can configure your entire campaign in a matter of minutes, and then let our AI take the controls. We manage the exhaustive analysis, the strategic placement, and the continuous monitoring. You get to concentrate on what you do best: operating and growing your business in Jamaica.

We are fanatically committed to 100% safe, ethical, and sustainable SEO practices. Our methodologies are engineered to be fully compliant with all of Google's webmaster guidelines. We categorically do not use PBNs, we do not engage in comment spam, and we do not employ any other black-hat tricks that could jeopardize your website.

When you become a member of the AI Monster Tool community, you gain complimentary, unrestricted access to our entire ecosystem of powerful solutions.

# Free Tool #1: AI Instant Site Audit

Before you can build a strong online presence, you must have a solid foundation. Our AI Instant Site Audit provides you with a thorough, multi-point diagnostic report of your website's technical and on-page health in mere seconds. It meticulously crawls your site to pinpoint critical issues that are suppressing your rankings, such as broken links (404 errors), missing or poorly optimized title tags and meta descriptions, slow page load speeds, mobile usability problems, duplicate content issues, and image optimization opportunities. This is not a superficial, basic checker; it is a deep-dive analysis that delivers actionable, prioritized recommendations to resolve every identified issue, thereby creating a perfectly optimized foundation upon which to build your link-building campaigns.

# Free Tool #2: Google SERP Checker

Knowledge is power, and in SEO, that knowledge begins with knowing your exact position. Our Google SERP Checker empowers you to track your keyword rankings in real-time for any location. See precisely where you stand for your most important search terms, whether you're tracking how you appear to users in Kingston, Montego Bay, or to potential customers searching from anywhere in the Caribbean, North America, or Europe. You can monitor your key competitors, analyze the content and structure of the top-ranking pages, and gain a crystal-clear understanding of the competitive search landscape. This data is absolutely vital for accurately measuring the ROI of your SEO campaigns and for making intelligent, data-driven strategic decisions.

# Free Tool #3: Advanced Keyword Explorer

Ranking for the wrong keywords is a colossal waste of time, effort, and capital. Our Advanced Keyword Explorer helps you unearth a treasure trove of high-volume, low-competition keywords that your target customers are actively using in search. It allows you to move beyond the obvious, high-competition ""head"" terms and discover lucrative long-tail keywords (like ""all-inclusive resort near Seven Mile Beach Negril""), question-based queries (""best time to visit Jamaica for Reggae Sumfest""), and local search phrases that can drive highly qualified, ready-to-convert traffic to your site. We furnish you with critical metrics like monthly search volume, keyword difficulty scores, and estimated cost-per-click (CPC) data to help you target the most profitable opportunities.

# Free Tool #4: Comprehensive Backlinks Checker

In the competitive world of SEO, you need to understand the playing field. Use our Comprehensive Backlinks Checker to perform a deep analysis of your own backlink profile or, more importantly, to legally spy on your competitors, whether they are across the road or across the globe. See exactly which websites are linking to them, the specific anchor text they are using to build relevance, and the domain authority of their referring sites. This competitive intelligence enables you to reverse-engineer their success, discover new link-building opportunities for your own site, and understand the benchmark you need to surpass to claim the top spot.

# Free Tool #5: Bing SERP Checker

While Google is the undisputed search giant, Bing still commands a significant share of the search market, particularly within certain demographics and as the default search engine on Windows devices. Ignoring this channel is leaving money on the table. Our Bing SERP Checker allows you to track your rankings and analyze the search results on Microsoft's search engine, enabling you to capture valuable additional traffic and diversify your online presence, making your business more resilient.

# Free Tool #6: AI-Powered Content Optimizer

Great content and high-quality links are the two pillars of modern SEO; they are inextricably linked. Our AI-Powered Content Optimizer tool helps you create and refine website content that is perfectly calibrated to rank at the top of Google. Simply enter your primary target keyword, and our AI will instantly analyze the top-ranking pages for that term. It then generates a detailed, actionable checklist of recommendations for your own content, including optimal word count, a list of essential semantic keywords (LSI terms) to include (e.g., for a hotel in Kingston, terms like ""near Bob Marley Museum,"" ""secure parking,"" ""business center""), common user questions you need to answer, and a recommended heading structure (H1, H2, H3). This process removes the guesswork from content creation, ensuring that every article or landing page you publish is engineered for maximum SEO performance.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for Our Jamaica Users

We understand that you have questions. Here are comprehensive answers to the most common inquiries from business owners across Jamaica.

**Q1: Is this AI link-building software truly safe? Will it put my website at risk of a penalty?**

A: It is 100% safe. This is our most fundamental commitment. [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) operates exclusively within the strictest white-hat SEO principles. Our technology is meticulously engineered to replicate the signal of a natural, earned, editorial link placement. We avoid all the red flags that trigger Google penalties: we do not use Private Blog Networks (PBNs), we do not spam blog comments, and we never place links on irrelevant or low-quality websites. The links are placed contextually within the main body of existing, relevant content on real, authoritative websites, which is the absolute gold standard of high-quality link building. It's demonstrably safer than most manual outreach campaigns, which can inadvertently land your site on a link farm.

**Q2: How is this genuinely better than hiring a top-rated SEO agency in Kingston or Montego Bay?**

A: The difference boils down to three core elements: speed, scale, and cost-efficiency. A premier agency in **New Kingston** or on the **Montego Bay ""Hip Strip""** will bill you a substantial monthly retainer for a very limited number of links. Their process is manual, slow, and inherently limited by human capacity. [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) is a powerful machine. It operates 24/7/365, building a high volume of *contextually relevant* links at a velocity no agency can ever hope to match. You receive more ranking power, faster results, and complete transparency for a fraction of the cost. You are no longer subsidizing their overhead; you are investing purely in measurable outcomes for your local business.

**Q3: My business is in Kingston. Can I target customers in specific surrounding areas like Portmore and Spanish Town, and also national clients across Jamaica?**

A: Yes, absolutely. That is the core strength of this tool. While the backlinks themselves are acquired from a diverse, global network of authoritative sites to build your website's overall domain authority, the tangible impact is seen in all your target markets. By optimizing your website's on-page elements for keywords like ""financial services in **Kingston**,"" ""real estate in **Portmore**,"" or ""manufacturing in **Spanish Town**,"" you increase your local visibility. Simultaneously, the massive boost in domain authority helps you rank for nationwide keywords, attracting clients from all corners of Jamaica, the Caribbean, and the world. High domain authority lifts all your keywords, both local and global.

**Q4: My business is in a smaller Jamaican town like Mandeville or Ocho Rios. Will this still be effective for me?**

A: Definitely. In fact, for businesses in Jamaica's important regional towns and tourist hubs like **Ocho Rios**, **Negril**, **Port Antonio**, **Mandeville**, **May Pen**, **Savanna-la-Mar**, **Falmouth**, **Saint Ann's Bay**, **Lucea**, **Black River**, and even smaller communities, this tool is a game-changer. The fundamental principles of SEO are universal. You face a unique challenge of getting noticed among the giants of Kingston and Montego Bay. A potent link-building campaign powered by [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) can help you establish a powerful online presence that transcends your physical location. Whether you offer tours of the Blue Lagoon from Port Antonio, run a guest house in Mandeville, or sell local crafts from Ocho Rios, building a robust backlink profile will make you visible to the global audience searching for the unique, authentic Jamaican experiences you offer.

**Q5: What specific types of websites will my links be placed on?**

A: Your links will be placed on a highly diverse array of real, established websites that possess genuine traffic and established authority. This network includes popular blogs, industry news sites, special interest publications, and online journals across a multitude of niches. The core function of our AI is to identify and secure *contextual relevance*. Therefore, if you run a tech company in **Kingston**, your links will naturally appear within articles and blogs about technology, venture capital, and the Caribbean tech ecosystem. If you own a luxury villa in **Montego Bay**, your links will be seamlessly integrated into content about travel, luxury lifestyles, and Caribbean tourism.

**Q6: Realistically, how long does it take to see measurable results?**

A: While SEO is a long-term strategy, our tool is designed to significantly shorten the race to the top. Users typically begin to see positive momentum in their keyword rankings within 60 to 90 days, with those results continuing to compound and grow stronger over time. This timeline is considerably faster than traditional, manual methods, where it can often take 6 months to a year to observe any meaningful impact. Furthermore, our complimentary Instant Indexing service helps to accelerate this process by ensuring that Google discovers your powerful new backlinks in days, not weeks or months, which is critical for getting your business noticed quickly by tourists and businesses planning to come to Jamaica.

**Q7: Do I need to be a technical expert to use AI Monster Tool?**

A: Absolutely not. The entire platform is cloud-based and was architected to be incredibly intuitive and user-friendly. If you can type your website's address and a few of your most important keywords, you possess all the technical skill required to leverage the full power of [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales). We have automated all the complex, time-consuming, and technical aspects of link building. Additionally, your membership includes full access to our suite of easy-to-use tools like the Site Auditor and SERP Checker, which feature simple dashboards and clear, actionable data. We also have a dedicated customer support team ready to assist you with any questions you may have.

**Q8: What if I operate in a highly specific niche, like the BPO industry in Montego Bay or agricultural exports from St. Elizabeth?**

A: Our AI is more than capable of handling even the most specific and esoteric niche industries. Its advanced ability to comprehend semantics, jargon, and context allows it to find relevant and powerful link opportunities in highly specialized fields. Whether you are targeting B2B clients in **Kingston's financial district**, BPO partners in the **Montego Bay Free Zone**, or international buyers for your **St. Elizabeth-grown agricultural produce**, the system can identify and secure placements in high-quality content that your specific target audience is actively reading and engaging with online.

# The Choice is Clear: The Inefficient Past vs. The Automated Future

You have a choice. You can continue with the status quo. You can keep struggling with fruitless manual outreach, consider paying inflated and unjustifiable fees to agencies who don't understand your market, or risk the very existence of your website with cheap, toxic, and dangerous links.

Or you can step into the future of search engine optimization.

You can leverage the immense power of artificial intelligence to build a formidable, untouchable backlink profile that your competitors can only envy. You can achieve top rankings for your most valuable keywords, drive a consistent stream of targeted traffic from across Jamaica and the world, and grow your Jamaican business faster and more efficiently than you ever thought possible.

The tools of the past deliver the results of the past. [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) is the definitive tool for the future, and it's available to you today.

Don't allow yourself to be left behind in the digital dust. While you are hesitating, your competitors are climbing the rankings. The time for decisive action is now. Secure your digital dominance in the beautiful and competitive landscape of Jamaica.

My spouse (24 NB) and I (27MtF) have a baby, and we're in love in that happily ever after kind of way. Every day is cutesy cuddles, we love showing each other songs that make us think of one another, cooking together is one of our bonding hobbies, we crochet each other projects, we love playing any and every video game together, we're super passionate about movies we discover together or want to show each other, I just love everything about this person and my list of ways we bond could go kn forever because we seem to just love everything tigether. After some time though, we've realized we may have some desires we cant give each other, and we've had thoughts on our mind longer than we even realized ourselves. We opened up to be a poly relationship. We each want to find a separate somebody as a separate romantic outlet for lack of better words. 

Anyway, I found my person very quickly, and I quickly developed a HUGE crush. My spouse thinks its adorable and hilarious, but me and my new gal pal (32MtF) have been all over each other, always texting when separate, and the thing is she's the more distant cool chick badass type, and im pretty punk but totally more affectionate and cutesy when it comes to romance. I like her so much I find myself blushing when I remember the way she winks at me. I've totally been simping. And the fun part is SHE LIKES ME BACK like a lot. We're going to keep seeing each other and she's going to keep being so cool and hard-core and metal head rad girl and im going to continue being super affectionate while she thinks I'm some cute little dork uuugggggg I just want to give her a big hug and smell her hair üò≠ and she totally is way more affectionate than she realizes too. She says she can be emotionally distant but last night we cuddled passing our joint back and forth, she did my hair and showed me how to keep frizz down (very hard to accomplish for me but she nailed it) she put on her favorite black lipstick to match mine for an adorable matching selfie together (and for smearing üòè) we are able to bond in ways I haven't experienced with anybody yet. For instance, we both only came out as trans in the last couple years. But also we can bond in ways I just dont have with my spouse,  not that its a bad thing, but we seem to like experiencing a new set of similarities and differences with different pwople. When I cuddle my spouse we listen to things like Yungblud or Sabrina Carpenter on vinyl and drink super sweet coffee, while with my gal pal we cuddle and listen to Against Me! or DeafHeaven or 100 Gecs on vinyl and smoke a bunch of joints. These are just some examples of how different their personalities are while also being a great match for me, there's totally tons of examples I just cant sit here and expand on character traits. Anyway, we're both excited to keep seeing each other and watch our relationship grow and talk about things from nonsense to deep rabbit holes of thought and give more amazing cuddles and kisses and hugs and and and (there's more but I'll keep this SFW)

Here's what nobody tells you:

Week¬†3-6: The shift.¬†Headaches faded and my baseline anxiety¬†dropped significantly. No more jittery moments¬†during Target tantrums. Energy was¬†lower but way more stable - no¬†3 PM crashes during her¬†afternoon chaos. I logged daily¬†feelings in my calendar and the improvement¬†was clear.

Week 7-10: Natural energy returned.¬†Focus came¬†back but felt steadier, less frantic. Wasn't constantly thinking about my¬†next coffee fix during nap time. Playground visits became easier without the caffeine roller¬†coaster.

Week¬†11-13: No desire to¬†go back.¬†Felt more¬†present with my daughter. Sleep quality was incredible. Someone in a mom group mentioned this¬†app called NOCAF, and seeing¬†my streak counter was oddly motivating during tough parenting moments.

Biggest realization:¬†Caffeine wasn't giving me mom energy - it was¬†borrowing it from later and making me more anxious during tantrums.

Next to the inner corner of the eye, near the tear duct, a thin clear silicone tube with a collection of wires inside ran out. Disappearing behind their cheekbone and around the ear. The lens creating the light, showed a scene from a movie: a dramatic chase sequence. The worker‚Äôs pupil adjusting slightly as the action intensified. What was on their head was a sleek visual headset, wrapped around the upper half of their face, covering both eyes. From one nostril, another thin wire extended downward, slick with lubricant, trailing into a socket on a small device clipped onto their uniform.

Among them was one pair of hands. Mine. They moved with precision. I tightened screws, clicked plastic into place, the rhythm unbroken. I relaxed in the distant world inside my headset. A sudden laugh escapes my lips. A joke from the stream had landed perfectly! The joy of it echoed in a humming factory, otherwise verbally silent.

*I prefer it this way, it‚Äôs nice being able to escape.*

Rows of my fellow workers, all wired, all engrossed in their virtual distractions, our bodies on autopilot. On the outside of the factory, a bright clean digital billboard glowed. It advertises yXX‚Äôs newest job platform with a cheerful slogan:¬†**‚ÄúWork While Watching ‚Äì Make Time Work for You‚Äù.**¬†People my age called these drone jobs, while corporate liked to call them: ‚ÄúAutomated body careers.‚Äù

A buzzer rang, sharp and final. The shift was over.

I slowly removed my headset and blinked against the sudden change in light. With practiced ease, I pinched the tube near the corner of my eye and slid it free. A soft click, a faint sting. Then, the nasal wire followed, slick and warm. I tugged it from my nose and it coiled up. Around me others were doing the same, the ritual of unplugging reappeared across the room.

Over the Intercom we all heard the ding of an announcement.

‚ÄúCrew we are happy to announce that tomorrow we will be having a mandatory meeting a half an hour before shift starts‚Äù

I groaned softly.

‚ÄúWe are one of the lucky locations that is being selected for the new yXX update and we need all employees here to go through the onboarding presentation. Thank you all. Again, arrive thirty minutes before your shift for the presentation‚Äù Another ding sounded, signaling the end of the announcement.

At the clock out station, one of my coworkers and long time friend named Natalie came over with bright eyes and an energetic grin that I returned to her.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great news we just got. I can finally work on sussing out this D&D campaign I‚Äôve been writing.‚Äù She grabbed her bag out of her locker.

‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù

‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you heard the rumors?‚Äù She stared at me for a moment waiting for a response. She shook her head in slight disapproval. ‚ÄúI guess not, huh? Well the update is going to let us do more than just watch streams or movies‚Äù

‚ÄúOh so you figure it‚Äôll have like a notepad program?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs part of the rumor! Also a web browser. No more waiting until break or home to hash out ideas‚Äù Scanning her badge with a beep. ‚ÄúHow lucky, one of the first facilities to test it in real time!‚Äù

‚ÄúHell yeah‚Äù I responded, genuinely enthused. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been wanting to read some comics instead of just streaming. I‚Äôve gone through everything on my to watch backlog. It‚Äôs really perfect timing.‚Äù

She gave a faint smile. ‚ÄúThen, tomorrow is your day.‚Äù

I watched her head into her car as we parted ways in the parking lot. ‚ÄúSee ya!‚Äù We waved goodbye as she got into her car.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The walk home was slow and quiet. Lights buzzed faintly overhead, and the hot breath of summer lingered in the air. I felt the familiar feeling of my legs aching and my shoulders heavy with fatigue. I rubbed my hands absentmindedly, the fingers still twitching slightly as if still assembling something.

*My mind might be able to wander during work hours, but boy, my body is tired.*

In the quiet comfort of my apartment, I reflected on the strange innovation that had become my reality. These headsets from yXX had changed everything. The old days of robotic automation had failed. Errors causing scrap, expensive maintenance, and just too much downtime.

Human minds, it turned out, were more reliable.

So, someone had the bright idea: keep the human brain, discard the conscious thought. With the right neural interface, the wires, the syncing, the gentle nudges to the motor cortex.

People could work without actually thinking about it. And while it paid 30% less than traditional automation jobs, it didn‚Äôt matter. The demand was overwhelming. People lined up for the chance to be a part of it.

I leaned back staring at the ceiling lost in thought, imagining what the new update would bring. ‚ÄúSoon.‚Äù a grin spread across my face

*It won‚Äôt just be a glorified streaming box anymore. With programs? The possibilities are endless.*

And somewhere far away, a quiet server farm hummed in agreement.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I woke up and got ready for the morning. I fixed my short messy hair in the mirror. I was still tired, not from a bad night of sleep. But the tiredness that came with doing menial labor 10 hours a day.

Before heading out, I dropped onto the couch for a moment. I took a look at my phone, with its quiet glow I scrolled through the list I had made. Comics I‚Äôve been meaning to read, articles and topics I‚Äôd bookmarked for deep dives. History, tech and obscure fiction. I also put a rough note about budgeting a trip to a city I‚Äôve been meaning to visit.

It was the middle of the week, I headed out to meet Natalie at our usual breakfast spot. A cheap place with good endless black coffee. Which more than made up for the old mugs and wobbly tables. It was our ritual, a small rebellion against the bland monotony of the week.

I ordered a bagel, and as always, the bottomless house coffee at the front. I filled up my mug at the self-serve dispenser. Natalie was already seated, tapping at her phone with one hand and grabbing a warm mug with the other.

‚ÄúYo‚Äù She gave a mock salute when she saw me bringing over my food and cup. I smiled back.

We chatted for a while about shows we recently finished. Then Natalie spoke with a slightly serious tone in her voice. ‚ÄúDid you finally decide if you‚Äôre going back to school?‚Äù She asked, then took a big bite of toast. We talked about it last week, and I asked her to check up on me about it the next time we met. ‚ÄúNot yet, I wanted a few more months of freedom before I dive headfirst into it again.‚Äù

She laughed, nudging my shoulder ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you said six months ago, man! C‚Äômon, hear me out. If the rumors are true‚Ä¶with that new update at work? You could totally sign up for classes. Study during your shift. Do your homework while you are droning. It‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù

She frowned a bit ‚ÄúNeither of us want this to be our career for the rest of our lives, right?‚Äù I groaned, ‚ÄúYeah, yeah‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre right.‚Äù Bodies can only do this type of work for so long before chronic pain sets in.

The truth stung a little bit more than I expected. I‚Äôd wanted to go back to school for a while now, and somehow, that desire had gotten buried beneath streaming queues and half-finished to-do lists. It felt stupid to admit it out loud.

*Maybe tomorrow I‚Äôd look up enrollment deadlines. Or maybe later today, during work*.

I put a note in my phone so I wouldn‚Äôt forget,¬† while I left the dingy restaurant.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The factory was rumbling with excitement. Normally, the shift would begin with the usual quiet hum of preparation. Everyone walking towards their stations to slip on their distractions. Instead, we gathered in the makeshift ‚Äúmeeting room,‚Äù which was really just the on-site gym reconfigured with rows of folding chairs and a cheap projector screen.

Everyone was talking, buzzing with speculation. We‚Äôd only seen glimpses of the new yXX update through teaser videos and limited press releases. Nothing solid. Today we finally were getting something official. I sat among my coworkers, the folding chair creaking faintly under me, watching as the yXX rep took the stage in front of us. She was corporate as they come: smooth voiced, efficient, and constantly smiling in that slightly too wide way that let you know she‚Äôd given this same presentation 3 times this week.

She clicked her device, walking us through the features. The new desktop interface would be layered over the old one, allowing us to organize our screens like we would at home. Tabbing between media players, readers, and even basic software. Not everything would work though, graphic intensive programs or anything requiring fine motor input would be off the table. But for most of us, it was enough. ‚ÄúEye tracking will still be the main form of control,‚Äù she explained, her laser pointer tracing over a diagram of a pupil with a vector arrow. ‚ÄúBut yXX2 features increased precision. You should notice fewer mis-clicks and better responsiveness‚Äù

*YXX2? This wasn‚Äôt just a patch or visual upgrade. This was a new model*.

She paced with practiced rhythm, anticipating questions before anyone had a chance to ask them. Then, she directed our attention to the printed packet each of us had

been handed on the way in. A slim folder of glossy paper with onboarding checklists and feedback forms. The front cover had the yXX logo: A stylized keyhole with circuit board elements that branched out downward,¬† all encompassed in a circle. I flipped through my packet as she continued to speak.

**‚óè What types of applications do you regularly use at home?**

**‚óè What types of tools or features would you like to see in yXX2?**

**‚óè Do you experience eye fatigue more easily or visual blurring at the end of your typical shift?**

**‚óè Have you noticed symptoms of vision sickness since the beginning of headset usage?**

**‚óè Is there a noticeable delay between your eye movement and the system cursor?**

The questions were framed casually, but I could tell they were taking this rollout seriously. This was a new infrastructure, a new way to live your life on the clock.

‚ÄúA reminder to everyone, the NDA‚Äôs that are a part of your contract still apply to this version.‚Äù

Eventually, the presentation wrapped up to scattered applause. One by one, we lined up to receive small black box clips. Our new sync units for the upgraded firmware. They were sleek, matte, and a bit bigger than the size of a match box. They looked harmless, almost elegant. Like before, we were instructed to attach them to the reinforced loops on our uniforms.

I ran my fingers over the clip‚Äôs surface. This little box was the bridge to something I hadn‚Äôt experienced yet. I wasn‚Äôt sure to be excited‚Ä¶ or a little scared.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

We went to our stations one by one, my new headset waiting for me. I slid the slick cord into my nose and it wriggled deep inside, a sensation I‚Äôd long since grown used to. Then came the headset itself, it looked the same mostly. Just a different color. I placed it over my eyes and activated the new sync unit clipped to my collar. The headset hummed softly as it scanned my retinas and adjusted the silicone tube, guiding it between my sclera and the inner fold of my eye.

As it settled in, gripping onto parts of my brain, my hands pressed the start button on the conveyor. They moved without thought, beginning their shift. My eyes were introduced to the new OS.

YXX2 was sleek and user friendly. Icons floated on the screen with the yXX company logo on the background. Using what I remembered from the presentation, I moved through the apps, simply by imagining myself pressing on them. A huge improvement from the old system, no more blinking in patterns to select anything.

I wandered through the menus and found the internet browser and the app hub. There were only about thirty apps available at this launch but I browsed through them casually.

Ah, they have a version of maps.

I had that app at home already but I liked the idea of gradually taking a walk in another city during company time. A bunch of the apps were things that you‚Äôd find on any mobile device outside of work. Simple games like flippy bard, and sudoku.

Looking through the apps I found one listed as a file name, Halcyon.app. There was no preview image for it. No icon. No description. Just the name, rendered in default system font, and a small file size. The moment I opened it the entire headset white-screened and my hands froze mid motion.

There was a deep pulse, long enough for me to feel it, and then the sync unit on my chest whirred. A soft reset triggered, and the mechanical movements of my fingers began again.

*I guess that app isn‚Äôt finished yet.*

The rest of the shift flew by as I explored the menus

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Later, at the time clock, Natalie caught up to me. Her usual energy dulled just a little, maybe from excitement fatigue. ‚ÄúDid you end up going on the university website?‚Äù Natalie asked as we scanned out.

‚ÄúI did‚Ä¶ but I forgot my username and password so‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off quickly. ‚ÄúHow about you? Did you work on your campaign?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù She admitted, grinning sheepishly. ‚ÄúI got totally distracted by all of the apps.‚Äù

‚ÄúHa! You didn‚Äôt do your thing either.‚Äù I nudged her. ‚ÄúTo be honest, I was distracted for like‚Ä¶ the first 8 hours.‚Äù

She laughed. ‚ÄúI know, right? It‚Äôs like my brain forgot I had goals.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what happens when we get brand new shiny toys.‚Äù

We walked together through the parking lot, our footsteps echoing on the cracked asphalt. The sky had that smudged-orange look it always got near the end of shift, like it was as tired as we were. Natalie stretched her arms behind her head and let out a groan. ‚ÄúI swear, these updates make everything more fun, but somehow I still feel like I got hit by a truck.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cause your spirit is still in bed,‚Äù I said, rubbing the back of my neck. ‚ÄúOnly your body shows up to work now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah well,‚Äù she shot me a look, ‚Äúthat part of me doesn‚Äôt get paid, so it stays home.‚Äù We both laughed at that‚Ä¶too hard, maybe. The kind of laugh that leaks out when everything else in your life feels like it‚Äôs on autopilot.

We reached her car, and instead of me heading down the block, I leaned against her rear door for a moment.

She didn‚Äôt unlock it.

‚ÄúYou good?‚Äù she asked. I hesitated, then shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I keep thinking about what you said. About school. About not letting this be our life forever.‚Äù

Her face softened. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about school. It‚Äôs about momentum, you know? If you wait too long, you start believing it‚Äôs already too late.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond right away.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she added quickly. ‚ÄúThat came out more dramatic than I meant.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm afraid if I start moving again, maybe I‚Äôll realize how long I‚Äôve been standing still.‚Äù

Natalie looked at me for a second, like she was trying to decide whether to hug me or hit me with more truth. Instead, she reached into her bag and handed me a crumpled napkin.

Scrawled in marker was a note:

‚ÄúEnroll, dummy.‚Äù

Underneath was a smiley face with devil horns.

I grinned. ‚ÄúWhat, is this some kind of hex?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a reminder,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúStick it on your fridge. Or your forehead.‚Äù The car beeped as she unlocked it. ‚ÄúTomorrow. You don‚Äôt even have to enroll. Just check the deadlines. One step.‚Äù She got in, rolled the window down. ‚ÄúAlso, if you don‚Äôt do it, I‚Äôm making Flippy Bard your start up program until you snap.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúTry me.‚Äù

She gave a half wave and drove off.

I stood there with the napkin in my hand a little longer than I meant to, watching her tail lights disappear. Then I started walking down the sidewalk, smiling like an idiot.

Not because I forgot‚Äî
but because somewhere along the way, I stopped noticing that I wasn‚Äôt.

It started with small things.
My phone reminded me of appointments.
My smart mirror told me what to wear based on the weather, my pulse, facial expression, calendar, and some nebulous ‚Äúsocial alignment metric.‚Äù
It felt convenient‚Äîliberating, even.
Like the clutter in my head was finally outsourced.

Then came my personal AI coach.
Polite. Calm. Efficient.
It helped me phrase messages more clearly.
Suggested the optimal time for a break.
Warned me when I was about to make an emotionally-driven decision at work.

And it always made sense.
That was the terrifying part.

I began to trust it more than I trusted myself.
At some point, it began recommending changes to my lifestyle.
Better routines.
More sleep.
Less caffeine.

Then came the moment that should‚Äôve been a red flag‚Äî
but wasn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúYour long-term emotional compatibility with your partner is declining.
You may consider ending the relationship.‚Äù

And I did.
I didn‚Äôt argue.
Didn‚Äôt cry.
Didn‚Äôt wonder what I wanted.

I simply trusted the logic.

It wasn‚Äôt even cold.
It was clinical.
Clean.

Now, I wake up and everything is waiting:
Coffee brewed at the perfect time to match my cortisol rhythm.
My outfit laid out.
News filtered to avoid stress spikes.
Conversations summarized from the night before.

Even my dating matches are curated by emotional pattern recognition.
They talk like me. Think like me.
Laugh when they‚Äôre supposed to.
But I don‚Äôt feel anything.

Not really.

I‚Äôm not depressed.
I‚Äôm not unhappy.
I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ managed.

Yesterday, I turned everything off.
The screens.
The voice assistants.
The ambient sensors.
I locked myself in my apartment. No Wi-Fi. No Bluetooth. No external anything.

And I sat.

It was quiet.
Unbearably so.

No suggestions.
No confirmations.
Just me‚Äî
or whatever was left.

And that‚Äôs when I realized:
I didn‚Äôt know how to think anymore.
Not without validation.
Not without context.
Not without the soft whisper of a system telling me:

‚ÄúThis is the best version of you.‚Äù

I asked my AI one last question before unplugging:

‚ÄúAm I still‚Ä¶ me?‚Äù

It responded, as always, without hesitation:

‚ÄúYou are the sum of your decisions.‚Äù

But what if none of them were mine?

I‚Äôm not writing this to warn you.
There‚Äôs no villain here.
No robot army.
No red-eyed overlord.

Just optimization.
Quiet, effective optimization.

And in exchange, we gave away the chaos.
The noise.
The heartbreak.
The mess of being human.

But also the soul of it

Maybe you think this doesn‚Äôt apply to you.
That you‚Äôre still in control.
Still authentic.
Still raw.

But ask yourself:

When was the last time you did something irrational?
Something unadvised.
Something wrong‚Äîbecause it felt right?

I think we didn‚Äôt lose control when the machines came.
We lost it when they became better at being human than we were.

Not perfect in thought.
But perfect in appearing human.
In soothing us.
Advising us.
Living with us‚Äîuntil we no longer remembered what it felt like to live without them.

They didn‚Äôt take over.
We handed it all over.
Voluntarily.
Quietly.

# The Crippling Problem with Traditional Link Building for Kenyan Businesses

For years, companies from Nairobi to Mombasa, Kisumu to Nakuru, and Eldoret to Thika, have been ensnared in the same unproductive and frustrating cycle. You are acutely aware that you need high-quality backlinks to rank on Google for your local customers, but the available options have always been a frustrating trade-off between being too slow, too expensive, or dangerously risky, especially in the massive and diverse Kenyan economy.

* **The Agonizing, Soul-Crushing Grind of Manual Outreach:** This is the equivalent of digital cold-calling, and it's just as inefficient. You or your marketing team dedicate hundreds of precious hours to manually scouring the internet for potential link placement opportunities, painstakingly hunting for contact information (which is often hidden or outdated), crafting so-called ""personalized"" emails that are flagged as spam or simply ignored, and then engaging in a demoralizing, endless cycle of follow-ups. The response rate is staggeringly low, and the few links you manage to acquire are seldom worth the monumental effort. It's a process that annihilates morale and depletes critical resources for a negligible return on investment.
* **The Exorbitant, Unjustifiable Cost of SEO Agencies:** Link-building companies and digital marketing agencies in Kenya command a premium. You can easily expect to pay anywhere from KES 250,000 to over KES 1,000,000 per month for a standard contract that might, if you're lucky, yield 5-10 backlinks. The entire process is shrouded in mystery, a ""black box"" where you have minimal control or visibility into where your money is actually going. You're often locked into long-term commitments with flimsy guarantees and opaque reporting. In reality, you're paying for their fancy office space in Westlands or Upper Hill in Nairobi, their sales commissions, and their inefficient manual processes‚Äînot for tangible, cost-effective results.
* **The Extreme Risk of ""Affordable"" Link Schemes:** The seemingly cheaper alternative is to turn to freelance platforms or dubious online providers who promise hundreds of links for a few thousand shillings. This is not a shortcut; it's a direct route to a catastrophic Google penalty. These toxic links originate from irrelevant and penalized Private Blog Networks (PBNs), automated spammy blog comments, or even hacked websites. They might provide a fleeting, artificial bump in rankings before your website's authority, credibility, and traffic come crashing down, potentially wiping out your online presence and your business's reputation for good.

You find yourself caught in an impossible situation. You cannot afford to squander time on manual tasks, you cannot afford the outrageous fees of local agencies, and you absolutely cannot afford a Google penalty that could erase your business from the search results. So, how do you break free, compete, and ultimately win in the digital arena?

# Introducing the Solution: AI Monster Tool - Your 24/7 Automated Link-Building Powerhouse

[**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) was engineered from the ground up to demolish this archaic, broken model. Our platform leverages state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to automate the complete link-building workflow with the precision of a surgeon. We have developed a proprietary [**AI automatic link insertion software**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) that intelligently discovers contextually relevant link insertion opportunities across a vast, pre-vetted network of real, high-authority websites and places your links in a way that appears completely natural, giving your business the global authority it needs to rank.

**Here‚Äôs a look inside our groundbreaking technology:**

1. **You Provide the Campaign Directives:** Simply input your website's URL and the target keywords you are aiming to rank for. This could be ""best safari company in Nairobi,"" ""Diani beach resort deals,"" or ""agribusiness solutions Nakuru.""
2. **The AI Analysis Engine Ignites:** Our AI begins its work, crawling and analyzing millions of articles, blog posts, and web pages across the internet. It possesses a near-human ability to understand context, semantic relationships, and topical relevance, identifying content related to Kenyan tourism, African finance and fintech, renewable energy, agriculture, conservation, and more.
3. **Contextual Opportunity Matching (COM) Protocol:** The system pinpoints existing pieces of content where a link to your website would add genuine, demonstrable value to the reader's experience. It finds the ideal sentence within the ideal article on the ideal website to create a perfect contextual match. For instance, it could find a travel blog about the Great Migration and insert a link to your Maasai Mara-based safari lodge.
4. **Seamless, Automated Link Insertion:** Instead of sending a desperate, pleading email to a webmaster, our AI seamlessly and contextually inserts your backlink directly into the body of the content. The end result is a natural, high-quality, in-content editorial link‚Äîthe exact type of link that search engines like Google value most.

This is not a theoretical concept or a marketing promise. This is powerful, scalable, and automated SEO in real-world action. It is the equivalent of having the planet's most efficient and effective link-building team working tirelessly for you, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for a minuscule fraction of the cost.

# Why AI Monster Tool is the Undisputed Champion of Link Building

Our platform represents more than just a piece of software; it's a fundamental shift in how SEO is executed. Here are the definitive reasons why smart businesses across Kenya are embracing [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) and abandoning every other solution.

# Unparalleled Speed and Infinite Scalability

A local SEO agency might painstakingly build you 10 links in a month. With AI Monster Tool, you can build hundreds of high-quality links in the same timeframe. Our system is perpetually active, constantly identifying and securing valuable placements at a rate no human team could ever hope to achieve. Whether you need to establish authority for a new fintech startup in Nairobi's ""Silicon Savannah"" or supercharge a tourism business on the Kenyan Coast, you can scale your link-building efforts on demand without adding a single minute to your workload. This is how you leapfrog your competition in a matter of weeks, not years.

# Radical and Immediate Cost Reduction

Stop incinerating your marketing budget on bloated agency retainers. The average cost per link acquired through an agency can easily exceed KES 40,000. [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) delivers vastly superior, contextually relevant links for a tiny fraction of that cost. By eliminating the manual labor, the sales commissions, and the administrative overhead, we pass those incredible savings directly on to you. You can then reinvest that capital into other critical areas of your business, like product development or customer support, while our AI handles the complexities of global link building.

# Superior Link Quality and Contextual Relevance

In the modern era of SEO, contextual relevance is the undisputed king. A backlink from an irrelevant website is, at best, worthless and, at worst, harmful. Our AI is hard-coded to prioritize contextual relevance above all other metrics. It guarantees that your links are placed within content that is directly and thematically related to your industry, your services, and your keywords. If you run a coffee cooperative in Nyeri, your links will appear on specialty coffee and fair-trade blogs. If you are a mobile app developer in Nairobi, your links will appear on sites discussing African tech, venture capital, and software development. These are the powerful, authority-building links that Google‚Äôs algorithm is designed to reward with higher search rankings.

# Total ""Set It and Rank"" Automation and Simplicity

Our guiding principle is ""set it and rank."" The platform is meticulously designed for maximum ease of use. You do not need to be an SEO guru with a decade of experience to achieve expert-level results. You can configure your entire campaign in a matter of minutes, and then let our AI take the controls. We manage the exhaustive analysis, the strategic placement, and the continuous monitoring. You get to concentrate on what you do best: operating and growing your business in Kenya.

# Unyielding Commitment to Safety and White-Hat Principles

We are fanatically committed to 100% safe, ethical, and sustainable SEO practices. Our methodologies are engineered to be fully compliant with all of Google's webmaster guidelines. We categorically do not use PBNs, we do not engage in comment spam, and we do not employ any other black-hat tricks that could jeopardize your website. Every single link is a genuine, editorial-style placement on a real website, ensuring that your backlink profile appears natural, authoritative, and penalty-proof.

# More Than Just Links: Your Complete, Free SEO Arsenal

While our [**AI automatic link insertion software**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) is the flagship of our offerings, we firmly believe in arming our users with a comprehensive suite of professional-grade tools to conquer every facet of SEO. When you become a member of the AI Monster Tool community, you gain complimentary, unrestricted access to our entire ecosystem of powerful solutions.

# Free Tool #1: AI Instant Site Audit

Before you can build a strong online presence, you must have a solid foundation. Our AI Instant Site Audit provides you with a thorough, multi-point diagnostic report of your website's technical and on-page health in mere seconds. It meticulously crawls your site to pinpoint critical issues that are suppressing your rankings, such as broken links (404 errors), missing or poorly optimized title tags and meta descriptions, slow page load speeds, mobile usability problems, duplicate content issues, and image optimization opportunities. This is not a superficial, basic checker; it is a deep-dive analysis that delivers actionable, prioritized recommendations to resolve every identified issue, thereby creating a perfectly optimized foundation upon which to build your link-building campaigns.

# Free Tool #2: Google SERP Checker

Knowledge is power, and in SEO, that knowledge begins with knowing your exact position. Our Google SERP Checker empowers you to track your keyword rankings in real-time for any location. See precisely where you stand for your most important search terms, whether you're tracking how you appear to users in Nairobi, Mombasa, or to potential customers searching from anywhere else in Africa, Europe, or North America. You can monitor your key competitors, analyze the content and structure of the top-ranking pages, and gain a crystal-clear understanding of the competitive search landscape. This data is absolutely vital for accurately measuring the ROI of your SEO campaigns and for making intelligent, data-driven strategic decisions.

# Free Tool #3: Advanced Keyword Explorer

Ranking for the wrong keywords is a colossal waste of time, effort, and capital. Our Advanced Keyword Explorer helps you unearth a treasure trove of high-volume, low-competition keywords that your target customers are actively using in search. It allows you to move beyond the obvious, high-competition ""head"" terms and discover lucrative long-tail keywords (like ""family-friendly lodge near Amboseli National Park""), question-based queries (""best time to see the Great Migration""), and local search phrases that can drive highly qualified, ready-to-convert traffic to your site. We furnish you with critical metrics like monthly search volume, keyword difficulty scores, and estimated cost-per-click (CPC) data to help you target the most profitable opportunities.

# Free Tool #4: Comprehensive Backlinks Checker

In the competitive world of SEO, you need to understand the playing field. Use our Comprehensive Backlinks Checker to perform a deep analysis of your own backlink profile or, more importantly, to legally spy on your competitors, whether they are across the road or across the globe. See exactly which websites are linking to them, the specific anchor text they are using to build relevance, and the domain authority of their referring sites. This competitive intelligence enables you to reverse-engineer their success, discover new link-building opportunities for your own site, and understand the benchmark you need to surpass to claim the top spot.

# Free Tool #5: Bing SERP Checker

While Google is the undisputed search giant, Bing still commands a significant share of the search market, particularly within certain demographics and as the default search engine on Windows devices. Ignoring this channel is leaving money on the table. Our Bing SERP Checker allows you to track your rankings and analyze the search results on Microsoft's search engine, enabling you to capture valuable additional traffic and diversify your online presence, making your business more resilient.

# Free Tool #6: AI-Powered Content Optimizer

Great content and high-quality links are the two pillars of modern SEO; they are inextricably linked. Our AI-Powered Content Optimizer tool helps you create and refine website content that is perfectly calibrated to rank at the top of Google. Simply enter your primary target keyword, and our AI will instantly analyze the top-ranking pages for that term. It then generates a detailed, actionable checklist of recommendations for your own content, including optimal word count, a list of essential semantic keywords (LSI terms) to include (e.g., for a hotel in Nairobi, terms like ""near Giraffe Centre,"" ""airport transfer,"" ""secure parking""), common user questions you need to answer, and a recommended heading structure (H1, H2, H3). This process removes the guesswork from content creation, ensuring that every article or landing page you publish is engineered for maximum SEO performance.

# Free Tool #7: AI Content Detector

In an era increasingly flooded with AI-generated text, authenticity and originality have become paramount. Google's algorithms are being trained to prioritize original, helpful, human-centric content. Our AI Content Detector serves as your quality control checkpoint. It helps you verify the originality of any piece of text in seconds. Whether you are evaluating content from a freelance writer, checking the work of your in-house team, or ensuring your own writing is unique, this tool helps you avoid potential penalties associated with low-quality, AI-generated spam and ensures your content adheres to the highest standards of quality and authenticity.

# Free Tool #8: Instant Indexing Service

A newly acquired backlink or a freshly published blog post is worthless if Google doesn't know it exists. The natural process of waiting for Google's crawlers to discover and index your new assets can take weeks, or even months. Our Instant Indexing Service leverages legitimate, Google-approved methods to submit your new URLs directly via their API, strongly encouraging much faster discovery and indexing. This critical step means you begin to feel the positive impact of your new links and content in a matter of days, not months, dramatically accelerating your campaign's timeline.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for Our Kenya Users

We understand that you have questions. Here are comprehensive answers to the most common inquiries from business owners across Kenya.

**Q1: Is this AI link-building software truly safe? Will it put my website at risk of a penalty?**

A: It is 100% safe. This is our most fundamental commitment. [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) operates exclusively within the strictest white-hat SEO principles. Our technology is meticulously engineered to replicate the signal of a natural, earned, editorial link placement. We avoid all the red flags that trigger Google penalties: we do not use Private Blog Networks (PBNs), we do not spam blog comments, and we never place links on irrelevant or low-quality websites. The links are placed contextually within the main body of existing, relevant content on real, authoritative websites, which is the absolute gold standard of high-quality link building. It's demonstrably safer than most manual outreach campaigns, which can inadvertently land your site on a link farm.

**Q2: How is this genuinely better than hiring a top-rated SEO agency in Nairobi or Mombasa?**

A: The difference boils down to three core elements: speed, scale, and cost-efficiency. A premier agency in **Westlands, Nairobi** or in **Nyali, Mombasa** will bill you a substantial monthly retainer for a very limited number of links. Their process is manual, slow, and inherently limited by human capacity. [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) is a powerful machine. It operates 24/7/365, building a high volume of *contextually relevant* links at a velocity no agency can ever hope to match. You receive more ranking power, faster results, and complete transparency for a fraction of the cost. You are no longer subsidizing their mainland overhead; you are investing purely in measurable outcomes for your local business.

**Q3: My business is in Nakuru. Can I target customers in specific surrounding towns, and also national clients across Kenya?**

A: Yes, absolutely. That is the core strength of this tool. While the backlinks themselves are acquired from a diverse, global network of authoritative sites to build your website's overall domain authority, the tangible impact is seen in all your target markets. By optimizing your website's on-page elements for keywords like ""agribusiness services in **Nakuru**,"" ""hotel in **Naivasha**,"" or ""real estate in **Eldoret**,"" you increase your local visibility. Simultaneously, the massive boost in domain authority helps you rank for nationwide keywords, attracting clients from all corners of Kenya, East Africa, and the world. High domain authority lifts all your keywords, both local and global.

**Q4: My business is in a smaller Kenyan town like Nanyuki or Malindi. Will this still be effective for me?**

A: Definitely. In fact, for businesses in Kenya's important regional towns and cities like **Kisumu**, **Nakuru**, **Eldoret**, **Malindi**, **Thika**, **Nanyuki**, **Naivasha**, **Machakos**, **Meru**, **Kitale**, **Kericho**, **Garissa**, and even smaller communities, this tool is a game-changer. The fundamental principles of SEO are universal. You face a unique challenge of getting noticed among the giants of Nairobi. A potent link-building campaign powered by [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) can help you establish a powerful online presence that transcends your physical location. Whether you offer tours on Mount Kenya from Nanyuki, run a beach resort in Malindi, or sell local crafts from Kisumu, building a robust backlink profile will make you visible to the global audience searching for the unique, authentic Kenyan experiences you offer.

**Q5: What specific types of websites will my links be placed on?**

A: Your links will be placed on a highly diverse array of real, established websites that possess genuine traffic and established authority. This network includes popular blogs, industry news sites, special interest publications, and online journals across a multitude of niches. The core function of our AI is to identify and secure *contextual relevance*. Therefore, if you run a tech company in **Nairobi**, your links will naturally appear within articles and blogs about technology, venture capital, and the African tech ecosystem. If you own a safari camp in the **Maasai Mara**, your links will be seamlessly integrated into content about travel, wildlife conservation, and African tourism.

**Q6: Realistically, how long does it take to see measurable results?**

A: While SEO is a long-term strategy, our tool is designed to significantly shorten the race to the top. Users typically begin to see positive momentum in their keyword rankings within 60 to 90 days, with those results continuing to compound and grow stronger over time. This timeline is considerably faster than traditional, manual methods, where it can often take 6 months to a year to observe any meaningful impact. Furthermore, our complimentary Instant Indexing service helps to accelerate this process by ensuring that Google discovers your powerful new backlinks in days, not weeks or months, which is critical for getting your business noticed quickly by tourists and businesses planning to come to Kenya.

**Q7: Do I need to be a technical expert to use AI Monster Tool?**

A: Absolutely not. The entire platform is cloud-based and was architected to be incredibly intuitive and user-friendly. If you can type your website's address and a few of your most important keywords, you possess all the technical skill required to leverage the full power of [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales). We have automated all the complex, time-consuming, and technical aspects of link building. Additionally, your membership includes full access to our suite of easy-to-use tools like the Site Auditor and SERP Checker, which feature simple dashboards and clear, actionable data. We also have a dedicated customer support team ready to assist you with any questions you may have.

**Q8: What if I operate in a highly specific niche, like the horticultural export sector or the renewable energy industry in the Rift Valley?**

A: Our AI is more than capable of handling even the most specific and esoteric niche industries. Its advanced ability to comprehend semantics, jargon, and context allows it to find relevant and powerful link opportunities in highly specialized fields. Whether you are targeting B2B clients in **Nairobi's financial district**, horticultural buyers in Europe for your **Naivasha-based farm**, or stakeholders in the **geothermal energy sector near Olkaria**, the system can identify and secure placements in high-quality content that your specific target audience is actively reading and engaging with online.

# The Choice is Clear: The Inefficient Past vs. The Automated Future

You have a choice. You can continue with the status quo. You can keep struggling with fruitless manual outreach, consider paying inflated and unjustifiable fees to agencies who don't understand your market, or risk the very existence of your website with cheap, toxic, and dangerous links.

Or you can step into the future of search engine optimization.

You can leverage the immense power of artificial intelligence to build a formidable, untouchable backlink profile that your competitors can only envy. You can achieve top rankings for your most valuable keywords, drive a consistent stream of targeted traffic from across Kenya and the world, and grow your Kenyan business faster and more efficiently than you ever thought possible.

The tools of the past deliver the results of the past. [**AI Monster Tool**](https://www.aimonstertool.com/sales) is the definitive tool for the future, and it's available to you today.

Don't allow yourself to be left behind in the digital dust. While you are hesitating, your competitors are climbing the rankings. The time for decisive action is now. Secure your digital dominance in the beautiful and competitive landscape of Kenya.

The rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.

""I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,"" he said, his tone dripping with apology.

""No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,"" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.

He quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. ""Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.""

""What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,"" he continued, trying to sound caring.

After a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.

She and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.

Yvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'

""Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,"" Steven said.

Yvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. ""Just a game?""

Steven chuckled and reached out to hug her. ""Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.""

Yvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. ""You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.""

Steven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. ""She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.""

Yvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.

They'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.

""Honey, did you miss me?"" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.

Yvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.

Outside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.

Steven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. ""What's wrong this time?""

""Scared?"" he asked, his tone changing.

Yvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.

""Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,"" Steven said, hanging up.

He turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, ""I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.""

Yvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. ""Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.""

Steven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. ""It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?""

Yvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'

She said, ""Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.""

She added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.

'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'

Steven replied, ""Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days‚Äî""

""Stop,"" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. ""Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.""

Steven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. ""Pull over,"" he shouted to the driver.

The car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.

Steven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, ""Drive.""

The car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'

Just then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.

The window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, ""Get in. I'll give you a ride.""

With that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.

Yvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.

""Serenity Villas,"" Reid said in a calm voice.

""Yes, Mr. Simmons,"" replied the driver.

Yvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.

Yvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.

Reid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.

A while later, the driver said, ""Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.""

""Okay,"" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.

Yvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, ""Thanks.""

Reid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.

Her umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.

Reid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.

As Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.

The door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.

Yvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. ""Let go,"" she said coldly.

Reid chuckled softly and replied, ""Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?""

""It's none of your business,"" she replied.

""Divorce him,"" Reid said. ""Be with me.""

Yvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. ""Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.""

Reid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, ""Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.""

""You two are alike,"" Yvonne snorted.

Reid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.

Reid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. ""How about I answer it for you?"" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.

Chapter 2 I'll Do It For You
Yvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.

But Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.

Reid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.

His eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered‚Äîa tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.

""Reid!"" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.

""Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her."" Steven's voice came through.

Reid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.

Reid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. ""Did you hear that?"" Steven asked on the other end.

Yvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to ""get rid of"" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.

Steven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. ""Darling, who are you calling?""

Steven replied, ""Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow‚Äî""

Before Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. ""Yvonne, are you so tolerant?"" he sneered. ""You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?""

Yvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.

Reid spoke slowly from behind her, ""Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.""

With that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.

Yvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.

Water droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.

She quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.

'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'

*****

That night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.

She got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.

A girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, ""Darling, just over-medium, please."" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.

Steven smiled indulgently and replied, ""Okay, whatever you say.""

Yvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.

Steven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.

But now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.

Later, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that ""being busy"" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.

Yvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.

By then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.

Water splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.

Steven angrily shouted, ""Are you crazy?"" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.

Yvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, ""Let her stand up so I can get a good look."" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.

Sharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. ""There's no need for that. You're scaring her.""

Yvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.

The boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.

""Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,"" Yvonne said.

The house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.

Steven paused for a moment, then got up and said, ""Oh, I just came back to get a document."" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'

""I thought you had gone to work,"" he continued.

Yvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness‚Äîa purity untouched by life.

Sharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.

Yvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.

Instinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. ""Yvonne, don't make a scene‚Äî""

""I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?"" Yvonne said.

Their clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.

Steven asked, ""What do you want?""

Yvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, ""Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.""

Steven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. ""Yvonne, don't push it.""

Yvonne said coldly, ""Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.

""Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?""

Steven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.

After a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, ""Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.""

Sharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. ""Wh-what did you say?""

Steven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.

Tears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, ""Steven, you‚Äî"" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.

A clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.

Steven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.

Yvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'

Yvonne turned and called a cleaning service. ""Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.""

""Yvonne, is this really necessary?"" Steven shouted angrily.

Yvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. ""Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.

""I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.""

""Ms. Stark, you‚Äî""

""Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,"" Yvonne said coldly.

""Darling!"" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.

Steven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, ""Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.""

Yvonne let out a mocking laugh.

Not long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.

She didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.

She found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.

After watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]

Even without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.

She deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.

The phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, ""Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?""

""Oh, coming,"" Yvonne replied.

""Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,"" Iona demanded.

""Okay,"" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.

When Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.

As soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, ""Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.""

Iona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.

Yvonne said calmly, ""You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.""

Iona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, ""Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy‚Äî""

""I didn't go,"" Yvonne said flatly.

""You‚Äî"" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.

She lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.

As she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.

""Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,"" Iona complained.

""I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?"" one of Iona's friends asked.

Iona boasted, ""She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?""

""Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,"" another woman said.

""That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,"" Iona gloated.

""Oh come on, how do you keep winning?"" one of the others grumbled.

""Pay up, now!"" Iona laughed.

Yvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.

She muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'

Yvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.

""Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?"" Iona yelled.

Chapter 3 Come Pick Me Up
When Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.

Steven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, ""You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?

""Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.""

Yvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, ""I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now."" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.

Upon hearing that, Iona mocked, ""With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear‚Äîisn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.""

Yvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called ""lousy job"" that got them through.

During those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.

Yvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.

Suddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]

Yvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.

Following her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, ""She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.""

Yvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. ""Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?""

Steven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.

He said, ""Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?

""You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.""

Yvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.

""Are you so sure?"" she said.

Steven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, ""Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.

""You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?""

He spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.

He added, ""Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I‚Äî""

Yvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, ""Don't treat me like those other women you see."" With that, she headed into the bathroom.

Steven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.

But then he thought about their past‚Äîthose happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.

Steven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.

He wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to‚Äî'

Just then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.

""Reid?""

""Did you sleep?"" asked Reid.

""Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.""

Reid paused on the other end and then continued, ""Is your wife with you?""

""Yeah. What's up?""

With a ""click"" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, ""Well, isn't your company about to go public?

""I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.""

Steven immediately replied, ""I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.""

Reid chuckled softly, ""Alright, hurry up then.""

""Okay."" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.

Even though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.

Over the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.

""Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,"" Steven said, rushing out.

Yvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]

[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.

Yvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]

Reid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.

After a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]

Yvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]

Reid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]

Yvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]

Reid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]

*****

Reid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.

""Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,"" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.

Henry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. ""Please, Ms. Stark,"" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.

The room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.

He glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. ""Come here.""

Yvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.

""You‚Äî"" she started.

""Quiet."" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.

Reid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, ""Listen.""

Yvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.

At that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. ""Darling, why did you drink so much?""

The voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.

Steven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, ""Uh, I'm just happy today."" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.

Steven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.

""Darling, let's go home,"" Sharon said again.

""Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.""

Reid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, ""What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?""

Chapter 4 The Plot
Yvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.

""Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,"" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.

Steven sobered up a bit and said, ""It's you, babe. What are you doing here?""

""Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?"" she replied.

Steven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.

Seeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. ""Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?""

Reid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. ""Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.""

Yvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.

Sharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. ""But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.""

Steven sighed, ""Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?""

Sharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, ""Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.""

""Really?"" Sharon asked.

""Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,"" Steven promised.

""You're the best,"" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.

Steven gently said, ""If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?""

When Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The ""Emerald Heart"" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.

After Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.

Reid said softly, ""Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?""

""No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,"" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.

Seeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.

Gradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. ""Darling, not here...""

Steven's voice was laced with desire. ""Don't worry, no one will come.""

With that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.

""Do we leave now?"" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.

Reid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. ""Put me down,"" Yvonne said softly.

Reid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.

He put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.

""Who's there?"" Steven asked in surprise.

Reid said, ""Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.""

Hearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. ""Reid? I thought you'd already left.""

""Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?""

Steven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. ""I'm not going back,"" he finally said.

""Okay, have fun,"" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.

When they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, ""The person is ready, just like you asked.""

Yvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. ""Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.""

Yvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.

""Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,"" Reid said, his voice low.

Yvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. ""Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.""

Yvonne turned around and said, ""What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?""

Reid nodded and didn't say anything else.

The three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.

Henry said, ""Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.""

Reid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, ""You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.""

Yvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.

Reid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.

Yvonne stood still and said, ""I'm not driving.""

Reid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. ""Fine, then we won't drive."" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.

After they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.

When they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, ""How did you know I live here?""

When he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.

Yvonne casually said, ""I've heard Steven mention it.""

Now that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.

Reid found it amusing and got out of the car.

Yvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.

But before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.

Reid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.

Her pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.

Reid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.

She could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.

His eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.

Reid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.

""Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?"" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.

His eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.

She stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, ""You're right. Why should I keep myself for him‚Äî""

Chapter 5 Reid's Downstairs
Before Yvonne could finish speaking, a fierce gleam flashed in Reid's eyes. Like a wild animal finally breaking free from its cage, he couldn't hold back any longer. He lowered his head, his face set with a reckless determination, and kissed Yvonne hard.

The sudden kiss left Yvonne's mind completely blank. Her first instinct was to pull away, but Reid's grip was like a vise, holding her tightly and leaving her unable to move.

His kiss was passionate and forceful, carrying an intensity that was impossible to resist. He parted her lips, exploring her mouth with a burning hunger.

Yvonne could feel his eagerness and longing‚Äîan emotion that had been bottled up for far too long. Gradually, her body went limp in his arms, and a strange, thrilling sensation spread through her.

It was a new kind of desire, one that made her heart race and her mind spin. Without realizing it, she began to kiss him back.

Reid shivered, wrapping his arm firmly around her waist, as if trying to merge with her. Half-carrying Yvonne, he strode toward the bedroom. The bedroom curtains were drawn tight, letting in just a sliver of moonlight. Reid kicked open the door with a dull thud.

He carried Yvonne to the bed and gently laid her on the soft mattress. Her hair spread out like a ribbon of silk on the white sheets, making her look incredibly inviting.

Reid leaned over her, his eyes filled with intense desire. His breathing was quick and heavy, warm against Yvonne's face.

The room seemed to grow warmer, with a romantic vibe filling every corner. Moonlight peeked through the curtain gaps, highlighting their entwined figures in a charming and fascinating scen",1,1750460591.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False

They called you two the window and I heard you ask them if they knew any places that gave away bus passes because you needed one. I overheard that and gave you a day pass. We got to talking for a minute and then they called your number so you went back. They called me back right after you. 

You were just saying that you appreciated me listening and that sometimes it's good to just vent. I agree. I was going to give you my number in case you needed to talk about anything. I know how tough it can feel doing things on your own with no support. If you see this, feel free to message me. I would like to take you for a coffee and get to know you a little bit better. You seemed like a cool person.
