She has made / watched me make many lattes at my setup (Delonghi ECP31.21 + DF54) and wants to get ""something better"".

We're mainly looking at second hand machines since there can be machines going for 50-60% the original price that are not even that old / heavily used by people that gave up or found espresso too complicated. The only criteria other than price is thermoblock, it will usually be used in a rush before Uni before leaving home, so it can't heat up for 10 minutes.  
  
She's been on the subreddit and has been influenced that the Bambino Plus is the best machine at this price point, but that leaves barely any room for a grinder. That ends up costing us 370EUR new with some corporate benefit coupon, and roughly 300EUR used in relatively good condition + \~90EUR for something like a Kingrinder K6.

On the other hand, Dedicas are going for insanely cheap on the used market. I found a Dedica 685 for 50EUR that's extremely clean with very little use. That would allow her to not settle with a hand grinder and maybe go for the Fellow Opus or Baratza Encore ESP. I already modded my ECP steam wand for a rancilio style one from aliexpress, we could do something similar to that for roughly 10 euros.

What route should we go? Is it wise at all to go for a dedica? The budget isn't really that tight, since she's in this excited state of making a new setup, but I'm a bit worried she's overspending for a beginner setup and not considering the importance of a good grinder yet. I've also watched the Toms Coffee Corner video comparing the BBP with the Dedica and it really doesn't look like it has too much difference in taste.

TLDR: 50EUR Dedica + Baratza Encore ESP or 300-370EUR Bambino Plus + some under 100EUR hand grinder? Is the bambino plus really worth the price difference?",1,1760299706.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1o4z90o,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinghtm/comments/1o4z90o/olivias_story/,Olivia‚Äôs Story,"Five Years 

November 17, 2023 marks five years of independence and freedom from the troubled teen industry. If you have a minute, I would like to share my story. 

For background, as a twelve year old child I was dealing with my parents horrific divorce and struggling with ODD, ADHD, and depression. I was failing in school and sneaking out and experimenting with weed, drinking, and self harm.

I was thirteen when I was sent to a place in Clayton, AL (‚Äúbumfuck nowhere‚Äù as my godmother referred to it - she wasn‚Äôt wrong). I say ‚Äúplace‚Äù because it was never clear what is was - ‚ÄúHarvest Time Christian Ministries, Inc.‚Äù by name. Referred to as ‚Äúgirls home‚Äù, ‚Äúboarding school‚Äù, ‚Äútroubled girls home‚Äù, and my favorite ‚Äúhome for wayward girls‚Äù. A Pentecostal boarding school for behavioral rehabilitation of teen girls. I met Jesus for the first time. But I was sheltered from the world, contact limited to monitored phone calls, monitored letters, and monitored monthly visits. 

We were placed on a ‚Äúlevels system‚Äù to track our spiritual growth. Each level (1-4) has led different privileges and ‚Äúresponsibilities‚Äù. In retrospect, I‚Äôve realized these levels were just to track our submission to the system. Were you behaving? Saying the right things? Acting the right way? 

There were cracks in the walls of our dorm that let in a draft if you happened to be on the top bunk in the winter.  We had a rodent problem that we exterminated ourselves. Often we handled the mice with sticky traps, set and disposed of by myself. Before preparing dry goods like rice, oats, flour, etc. we would sift through all of it for a southern bug called a ‚Äúweevil‚Äù, which infested the pantry. We had to maintain the entire 9 acre property ourselves. We were told that we should be grateful for the work because it means we are being useful to the kingdom of God. Most of the time when we were working outside, it was under an Alabama heat advisory. We mowed, did the weed eating, picked the pecans, trimmed hedges, etc. Holidays felt like their own special torture because the pastor had a poor childhood so they ‚Äúwanted us to have everything they could never have‚Äù so they made us decorate seven trees to her liking. If the decorations - lights, garlands, ornaments- weren‚Äôt to her liking the whole thing would be taken down and redone until it was. I‚Äôll never look at a Christmas tree the same ever again. 

I work with children now and have to follow certain guidelines - as we are an accredited school with safety guidelines. It is wild to me to think about the child labor I endured in the Alabama heat‚Ä¶ it was all just considered a necessary evil. And I never thought twice about it because I was a child. No one was looking out for us. Beyond Christ being the higher power and protecting me through all these things‚Ä¶ there were no laws and no government officials that even batted an eye at what was happening here. 

Our punishments were nothing short of religious abuse - being forced to copy word for word pages upon pages of the Bible while our peers got to watch movies. Sometimes the staff would go out of their way to get sweet treats for the rest of the students while we were on ‚Äúrestriction‚Äù. We were denied certain types of food while on restriction - any type of sugar. Not just desserts but even sugar for our coffees. This was never particularly triggering for me as I never struggled with an eating disorder. However, I can only imagine that mind game that played on someone who already felt like they weren‚Äôt worthy of eating that day.  If we wanted ‚Äúseconds‚Äù on the food that was donated from the United States Department of Agriculture Food Bank (USDA), we had to wait till we were last. Sometimes they would reward ‚Äúseconds‚Äù to the ‚Äúhigher level‚Äù students in the program. 

The quality of food nutritionally was poor. Whether or not that‚Äôs a big deal to you as a reader, I don‚Äôt know. The food was high in fat, carbs, grease, cholesterol. When you order from the USDA, you order boxes of ‚Äútypes‚Äù of foods. For example you could sign up for a box of snacks or a box of poultry. Sometimes we would get ten boxes of twinkies in our ‚Äúsnack‚Äù order and then that would be our only snack option for weeks.  Outside recreational time was very seldom. Considered a privilege even. Physical Education was very rarely rarely enforced, because it meant someone would have to guide us in a workout. I went from 120 to 160 in a matter of months. Going through puberty while taking in an unrealistic amount of calories every day and not having anywhere for those calories to go was devastating to my self esteem and relationship with food. 

There were no nutritionists, no psychologists, no therapists. I won‚Äôt say never never, but rarely did our ‚Äúteachers‚Äù even have teaching degrees. Most of the ‚Äúteachers‚Äù and staff were graduated students. Children honestly. 17 year olds teaching fifteen year olds geometry, algebra, civics.

There were girls at this home that had been snatched out of their beds in the middle of the night by people that they didn‚Äôt know, tossed into a van, and transported to this location. Most girls had NO IDEA where they were for most of their time there. Girls were lied to constantly to get them to this school the day of intake. Some people were drugging their kids with over the counter medications. 

Since working with children I have been required to take classes on sexual abuse of children and what it means to be a mandated reporter of child abuse and neglect. The state of Alabama, where this institution resided, states that social workers, teachers, clergy, and any employee at ‚Äúhospitals, clinics, and sanitariums‚Äù are mandated reporters. Circling back to what I said about ‚Äúwhat even was this place categorized as‚Äù, that just about covers whatever the staff at Harvest Time could refer to themselves as. 

I was abused emotionally and physically by my mother. I was groomed by a peer and raped when I was thirteen while nearly a dozen teenage boys watched from the woods. Four months after my arrival at this place I told the staff members, a year later I told my mother. 

Nobody told me I had rights and could press charges. Nobody reassured me that that wasn‚Äôt my fault and that I was a victim. I felt like I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and therefore ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt be protected by God‚Äù as I was ‚Äúliving in sin‚Äù. For years I have felt disgusted by my body - I felt my figure must be responsible for being such a target to this kind of premeditated violation. This feeling was only reinforced by the detrimental purity culture forced  upon young women by southern churches (and churches in general for the most part). 

These girls came from families with trauma, neglect, abuse of all sorts. The vast majority of these girls confided in their mentors and teachers. I‚Äôm deeply disturbed that no one saw fit to report these incidents to the higher authorities. 

Institutions that are not held accountable by accreditations like NAEYC should NOT be allowed to exist. Every single staff member that works with children should be trained on incident reports (injuries and sickness) and mandated reporting. If an accredited institution had even half of the injuries (frequently sustained during outside manual labor and ‚Äúplayful competitions‚Äù that they organized) reported as I saw while at HTM they would LOSE their accreditation and be facing shutdown imminently. I‚Äôm so disgusted by the lack of advocacy and accountability I‚Äôm realizing every day that it was willful ignorance that kept us each from receiving advocacy and justice. 

I really can‚Äôt even begin to explain the damage this did to me emotionally and mentally. I was in this program for 4 years and stayed on an additional year as an intern until I had turned 18, all I knew is that I wasn‚Äôt going to be safe in my mother‚Äôs care. I had extreme social anxiety, made poor decisions as I experienced a major culture shock (Surprise! The world changed ALOT between 2013 and 2018). Not to mention I don‚Äôt even have a high school diploma thanks to this place. They weren‚Äôt accredited and were using a Christian homeschool system that still doesn‚Äôt teach evolution. I had to take a GED test even after I ‚Äúgraduated high school‚Äù. I like to say I graduated twice‚Ä¶ finding the humor in the situation. 

Three months after my graduation my mother disowned me and I was forced to take my own life by the reigns with no practical life experience - I had had no independence, had developed no self discipline as everything was regulated for me, I had no concept of money - while I worked for this Ministry for over a year, I was an unpaid intern. I had no career/job experience. It was ‚Äúfake it till you make it‚Äù all day.

According to the American Psychological Association - ‚ÄúMore than 1 million American youth end up in juvenile court every year, and about 160,000 of them are referred to residential placements, including detention centers, residential treatment centers, correctional institutions and group homes, according to a 2011 Social Policy Report by the Society for Research in Child Development. However, the report finds that such settings often do more harm than good, causing depression, thoughts of suicide, acting-out behaviors and recidivism among these youth.‚Äù (‚ÄúA Better Option‚Äù by Tori DeAngelis published on Dec. 11, 2011)

 I called the Reverend in 2021 (‚ÄúRev‚Äù is what the people closest to her called her) and asked if she could sign a statement saying that my relationship with my parents was emotionally and at times physically abusive and she refused, stating, ‚ÄúIf I had felt you were unsafe I wouldn‚Äôt have released you to your mother‚Äôs care.‚Äù This statement was going to help FAFSA more accurately identify my financial ability to support myself through school by myself. In that moment‚Ä¶ I knew that it wasn‚Äôt about what was best for me. It never had been. It was about self image and self righteousness. Signing that statement would have been an admission of wrong in her perspective. Never-mind the fact that I was eighteen at that point and had made my own decision to come home, removing her of any said culpability for whatever came after. I didn‚Äôt know I needed as much healing as I now know to be true, even hearing her voice that day made me break into tears. 

Obviously I was at a point in my life where someone needed to intervene. What I needed were parents who listened to the thoughts in my head without taking them as personal attacks. I needed someone to show me I could be loved through my negative behavior, that I was still worthy of love while in a dark place mentally. If you are a parent considering a home or center for your child, please make sure you‚Äôve done some serious introspection into what you could be contributing to the issue. And if you know anyone who‚Äôs told you they‚Äôd been placed in a troubled teen facility, give them an extra hug or some support because you never know what they‚Äôve been through. 

Recently, the last young woman associated with this ministry broke free and as I read her story I sobbed into my boyfriends arms. In order to not lose my mind entirely, I will always look back on certain moments with fondness. When faced with darkness we all learned how to make our own light in the day to day. And again, I praise God for the good that came out of such a hurtful and confusing situation. 

This isn‚Äôt a sob story about me. This was my reality and many many others reality. It continues to this day. The troubled teen industry is a disgusting practice that needs to be put to an end.

I tried at first to keep the conversation just a hi, I live here now. He told me he wanted to talk outside and I agreed. He wanted to kiss me and I said no. He told me all of the things I wanted to hear. That he still loves me, thinks it‚Äôd be easier this time around now that I‚Äôm local. I told him if we do this I‚Äôve got boundaries and he said he‚Äôd respect them. I agreed to kiss him and then all the feelings came back. I asked him to come home with me to cuddle. He obviously wanted to do more than that. 


The next morning we got coffee and talked about taking things slow. When I dropped him off at his car he mentioned friends with benefits. Got his number cuz I deleted it. His replies were very one worded and when I told him I wanted to get my sweats back cuz I‚Äôm in a weird headspace he didn‚Äôt say anything besides ok.

1o4z3k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1o4z3k6/is_this_friendship_becoming_onesided/,Is this friendship becoming one-sided ?,"I (31F) have a friend (also 31F) who is in her first romantic relationship after being single all her life.  We have the same career and have studied together. For most of our friendship, we‚Äôve related deeply through shared struggles ‚Äî career stress, emotional growth, and navigating life without the usual ""milestones"" (relationships, marriage, etc.).

For context: I‚Äôve been single all my life except a few months relationship 7 years ago that was emotionally abusive. I didn't even have sex because I couldn't trust the guy. I took time to work on myself, relocate for work, and focus on emotional stability. I‚Äôm in a good place now, but still single despite my efforts ‚Äî and sometimes still feel sensitive about romantic milestones. All of my friends from high school are paired up.

This specific friend started dating a year ago for the first time in her life, and her third first date turned into her first-ever serious boyfriend. They‚Äôre happy together, which I truly am glad for !! But lately, the dynamic between us has changed and I‚Äôm struggling with it emotionally.

She often says things like:

* ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my first relationship ‚Äî I struggle with it, especially compared to my brothers who‚Äôve had girlfriends forever, you know?‚Äù
* ""I feel incredibly late in life compared to people who‚Äôve already married and bought houses a few years ago !""
* ‚ÄúMy parents are just so happy I finally have someone. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll like him no matter what.‚Äù
* I had mentioned a painful experience I had last year, when I had to walk away from a non-comital guy who I was developing feelings for. I didn't feel safe and seen enough to delve deeper in the topic, so I just said ""really, it's awesome you have met your boyfriend !! Not all men are like this. Just recently I had a bad experience with one of them ... She replied ""aaah !!"" in a ""that sucks"" way, but didn't ask any more questions 

On the surface, these are innocent comments ! But in context, they feel tone deaf. She knows I‚Äôm single and that I had a difficult past relationship ‚Äî but she never checks in on how I‚Äôm feeling about love, dating, or emotional milestones. The conversation is 75% about her, really : her boyfriend, her anxieties regarding emotional intimacy with her bf, her in-laws, her taxes. I listen, nod and when I give advice, she says things like ‚ÄúThank you so, so much, that really helped,‚Äù which is nice ‚Äî but I can‚Äôt remember the last time she gave me support or insight that helped me emotionally.

Overall, I feel like she's self focused at the moment.

She didn‚Äôt attend my thesis defense, even though I went to hers. She offered me a coffee to ‚Äúcelebrate,‚Äù which was kind, but I contributed to her graduation fund and drove 2 hours to attend her event ‚Äî it felt disproportionate. I‚Äôm trying not to be petty, but it stung. For her defense though, I was quite disheartened to see that some other friends and family members couldn't make it to my they defense (she knew) so I told her ""yeah it's no big deal anyway !"".

I keep wondering ‚Äî am I just being envious? Is this my issue to work through? Or is it fair to expect a friend to make space for¬†my¬†experience too?

She wasn‚Äôt always like this. She used to be more emotionally available and balanced. I think this relationship ‚Äî her first ‚Äî has created tunnel vision, and maybe she doesn‚Äôt realize she‚Äôs become self-centered. I don‚Äôt want to confront her in a dramatic way, but I also don‚Äôt want to keep shrinking myself emotionally in a friendship that no longer feels reciprocal.

**TL;DR**  
My friend is in her first relationship and shares a lot about it, often in ways that feel unintentionally insensitive to my experience. I feel like the emotional balance in our friendship has shifted, but I don't know if I am just being envious ? Thank you so much !!!",1,1760299277.0,AskWomenOver30,1,1.0,False

1o4yye6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4yye6/how_to_get_over_ex/,How to get over ex?,"Hi all,

Some things changed for confidentiality. So I dated my ex for four years, and one day of the blue they broke up with me. We had been doing long distance, which was tough, but doable, and the end was in sight. The long distance was my fault for having to go off to school for two years. after he broke up with me, he kept in touch and called every day until I moved home six months later. I was still desperate to have him back, and he is the only man I‚Äôve ever loved (I‚Äôm 32 now). 

When I moved home we started seeing eachother twice a week for dates, and I did keep telling him I wanted a relationship but he would be cagey about it. At dinner once he said that the worst day of his life would be the day I married someone else. And a month later he cried in my arms about how he had hurt me. 

In parallel, my job when I moved back was terrible, and I got an opportunity to move again far away for an awesome job. I took it and it again will be a temporary thing where I will be gone for three years. And then I‚Äôm moving back home permanently.

I told him I was leaving again and he looked crushed, but how am I supposed to plan around a man who can‚Äôt make a decision? I was begging him to stay. 

Two weeks before I am leaving (which I felt terrible because I hated leaving and moving so incredibly much) he asked me for a walk and said he had started dating someone else. He had been messaging me still every day and using my pet names.
 
I was crushed but I picked myself up and moved countries. He called every three days or so and used my pet names and was charming. Three months into the new place I asked him to stop contacting me because if he wasn‚Äôt going to date me then it was actual torture. He said at that call that it was a good thing he didn‚Äôt try to date me because I would‚Äôve just left again and he couldn‚Äôt have survived that.

Cut to a couple months after that, he sent the most beautiful note for my birthday last year and he sent text messages throughout the year, although he grew more distant obviously because he had a full blown relationship with someone else. But he was still messaging probably once a month using my pet names.

We had a mutual work thing in April (a year out from me moving) and we met for dinner with a colleague and he looked like he saw a ghost. I was acting normal and I just would catch him looking at me and it was the oddest thing. He broke my heart over and over and I don‚Äôt understand why he was looking at me so odd. I wanted to address it, so I asked for a coffee during the week, but he really was so avoidant. I‚Äôve never had an ex seem to need to flea a room, and I wasn‚Äôt angry but I was just so confused and hurt. He used me as like an emotional comfort blanket so that he could fall in love with the new girlfriend.

I texted him for his birthday and I was the first person he messaged back on his birthday and he was super sweet about it. And then a month later I heard from a mutual friend that he is moving in and marrying the new girlfriend. And after that I sent a message that I heard, was happy for him, but asked him to please never contact me again. We spent like 24/7 together before I moved and all our time talking when I moved and he was my best friend for like 5 years.

Basically I‚Äôm wanting to know of any examples where people got over stuff like this. I really haven‚Äôt found love again and have dated a ton, and I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs going to happen for me. And I still feel so hurt and used. And I think maybe there is something wrong with me psychologically for not being an able to let him go.",1,1760298936.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

We moved in together early on because she had to move out of her old apartment (which she shared with her ex boyfriend) and I offered to move in. This way we‚Äòd find out if we‚Äòre compatible or not eary on.

These past few months we‚Äòve been fighting about a few things, two main topics have been resurfacing every time. First of, her messiness. When I offered her to move into my apartment I thought I made it clear that I do not like living in a messy space. My girlfriend appartently does not care, because she still has not unpacked all her boxes, she does not vacuum the place even though her cats leave behind a lot of hair. She doesn‚Äôt clean the dishes, she doesn‚Äôt return packages and instead lets them sit on the coffee table for weeks. No matter how often I‚Äòve brought it up, she makes an effort for a few days and then it‚Äòs back to leaving the place in a mess.

It‚Äòs messing with my head. Before her my apartment was always tidy. It gives me peace of mind. I don‚Äôt want to live in a place where there‚Äòs laundry laying around, cat hair on all the furniture‚Ä¶ I work a lot, and after work I also clean up after two people, even though househould chores were supposed be shared.

The second argument we‚Äòve been having on and off is her terrible financial situation. She owns 3 horses for a start. Horseback riding is an incredibly expensive hobby, having 3 horses is almost impossible to finance if you dont have a high paying job. She also has an expensive car, which she has to pay off monthly. Up until about a year ago her father paid all those things for her, but at one point he said enough is enough, so he stopped paying.

My girlfriend doesn‚Äôt have a normal job. She works as a waitress in a Restaurant, and she gives horseback riding lessons for kids. It‚Äòs not a steady paycheck, there are good months and bad months. She cannot save any money, everything she earns is gone the minute it hits her bank account, because her lifestyle is so expensive. Instead of trying to save some money, she spends what little she has left each month on clothes, shoes, coffee‚Ä¶ 

For our shared apartment we bought a sofa together. I payed upfront, and told her to pay  me back when she can. A few weeks ago we went on vacation together, I also paid her part upfront. A few months ago she went on a bachelor party and asked me to loan her 400$, I did because I didn‚Äôt want her to be left out. She owes me almost 3000$ at this point, and whenever I try to discuss this topic she blocks me off and walks away. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I love her very much, but these things bother me.",3,1760298823.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

We've had a wasp nest in the side of my house for a while now.  Last week they stung one of my friends, so it was time to get rid of them.

Given the amount of wasps in and out, it seemed like a big nest.  To guestimate the size, I would say a wasp entered or left the nest once a second, all day.  I didn't want to just squirt poison down the hole - that would just piss them off and not reach most of it.  So I decide to seal the nest with expanding foam sealant.  I snuck out in the dead of night, and stuck enough foam in that hole to seal half a construction site.  

Little did I know how terrible of an idea this was.  

APPARENTLY, there was another exit to the nest - going inside the house.  

This nest is ENORMOUS.  Average size for a nest this late in the season is 2000-4000 wasps.  Half our house is currently inaccessible.  I sneak down to the basement at night to change the traps.  I keep a hand vac next to my work station.  Our cats are NOT happy they've been locked into a single room, and are pissing everywhere to show their discontent.  Doing my best Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonation, I've gone through ~7 magazines on the bug assalt shotgun, with maybe 40 shots per magazine.  These fuckers are amor plated, and do not die easily.  I've *injured my arm, pumping the shotgun so many times*.  

I think the most disconcerting thing is how normal it's become.  I wake up, grab the shop vac on the 60ft extension cord, and just clear the house as a matter of routine.  Its part of rising and shining for the day.  Coffee, breakfast, wasp vacuuming, kiss the wife goodbye - time to work!  The cold is going to kill them at some point....right?

For reasons I won‚Äôt bore you with my husband and I had a regular bicker about laundry after work one evening. Nothing drastic, no one did anything or anything really bad. Yet somehow the fight went on and on and on and it got worse and onto 100 other topics. Before I knew it I said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm done, I can‚Äôt do this anymore‚Äô (we argue A LOT) and much to my dismay he said ‚Äòok‚Äô 

I doubled down and said I‚Äôm packing my things. He said ‚Äòalright‚Äô 

I was devastated but carried on. I pulled all my stuff out the house into the spare room. Things that were inherently mine like a hot pink coffee cup, my books, my stuff ya know. 

He sits on the sofa and says nothing. I look at him and say ‚Äòyou could literally stop this. U know what to do to stop this‚Äô which was just like stop being stubborn and talk to me and stop me or say something anything idk (he does this a lot) but he doesn‚Äôt do anything. We have a super king bed made up of two mattresses. I take my ‚Äòhalf‚Äô to the spare room to sleep in there as I‚Äôm like, telling him I‚Äôm sick of fighting and the marriage is done for. I asked 100 times for couples counselling and he wouldn‚Äôt book it and I couldn‚Äôt book it as he has a strict work schedule , I do not. So he needed to figure out his availability to do it. Anyway, I could have booked it too, I guess. It was my one request our last huge fight was that he booked it for us and I think I was testing if he‚Äôd care enough to book it‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt. 

So I‚Äôve gathered most my stuff up I‚Äôm very angry, upset, hysterically crying because I‚Äôm like damn he didn‚Äôt stop me like we‚Äôre getting a divorce I guess? Bevause of course if he agrees it‚Äôs done with too and it can‚Äôt be fixed then‚Ä¶that‚Äôs that. He comes into the spare room and asks kindly, soft as a mouse, with all the love ‚Ä¶what do you want for dinner? 

I‚Äôm like WHAT? What do I want for dinner?! I just packed all my stuff, tore the house apart separating my things, booked a hotel for tomorrow night for space and u watched me do it all like it was a play or something and the first and only words I got is ‚Äòwhat do you want for dinner?‚Äô He said well we have to eat? 

Okay???? So that happens, he gives me some dinner in the spare room which is nice but I‚Äôm hysterically crying, hyperventilating, snotty full on girl cry mess. He rubs my back affectionately AND ASKS ME WHAT IS WRONG?! I felt like I was punched. I reiterated the above. He said ‚Äòok‚Äô the morning came and he brought me coffee into the spare room. He said ‚Äòsee you later‚Äô to which I said ‚Äòyou won‚Äôt? I‚Äôm staying at a hotel for some space for one night remember?‚Äô (I‚Äôve NEVER done this) he said ‚Äòoh okay. If that‚Äôs what you want to do. Can I have the house keys?‚Äô I‚Äôm flabbergasted. Perplexed. Bewildered. I say nothing and do exactly that. I go to work as normal back a small overnight bag and go to a hotel to think about wtf just happened did my marriage just end (we‚Äôve been together 6 years) and he doesn‚Äôt call or text me all day, that day. I text him something like ‚Äòreally?‚Äô Normally we text all day like got to work, how‚Äôs lunch, what‚Äôs ur work day like and then we text at the end of the day for rides? I get to the hotel at 3pm and carry on working from there. 6pm comes round he finally texts and says do u want me to pick u up after work?! I says ‚Äòno. I‚Äôm at the hotel‚Äô he said oh‚Ä¶. Okay see you tomorrow 

Tomorrow comes he didn‚Äôt call he doesn‚Äôt text he didn‚Äôt check on me at all. I felt it right there. I fell out of love right in that second when I woke up at 10am to not one message. Usually he would 100% text me in the morning / when he got to work / if I go on holiday with family etc 

I call him because my first thought was - did the late night of us texting all night where I was trying to explain how insane this is (got no where) make him over sleep and miss work! Bevause that‚Äôs totally a him thing to do. No. He answers ‚Äòhi‚Äô all moody. I say ‚Äòwhat the fuck? Really?‚Äô And he goes this is why I didn‚Äôt call I knew it be hours of this 

I‚Äôll stop there. I had to go home that night, as I had no more money to stay another night. I got home, he wouldn‚Äôt pick me up either which normally he does so I got the bus.

When I was happily married I didn't care to much about because I was codependant on my partner and she filled in on all my needs. I had years were I struggled with my physical self and always assumed that my appearance was the thing that kept people at away.

Last year I divorced, begun working on myself and got in best shape I ever was. Then came the realisation that people were still not reaching out because I was not letting them.
I struggle with talking to strangers in a public because I lack a ""mask"" to wear in that setting. I wear ""masks"" at my work, interests or when I do sports. I reserve ""maskless"" me for a select few.

Talked about this with my psych and he recommended getting out of my comfortzone and meeting with strangers and be maskless me. I signed up through a website for a coffee-meet with a small group (I don't feel like big groups where I need to approach people myself) of people in a pub at my city.

Set my nerves aside and went today to find reserved table with 3 other guys. We had good talk about about general topics such as politics, housing problems, jobs, etc.
At some point I felt like taking the plunge and told then I was there to expose myself due to my social anxiety. My heart was beating like crazy expecting because I felt like I was sharing something they possible considered cringe but they turned out really supportive! Gave me advice for other meets and one of them even told me that he had similar social anxiety and meetings like this helped out a lot for him.

We left eventually and I went back home feeling proud but as the moments passed by I started spiraling in my head. Started to hate myself for needing this, being dissapointed in myself to even think that people would judge me over expressing myself.

It left me in a poor mood when it should have made me feel great. And that in turn is even more discerning because I feel like I could be a great person trapped inside a prison of doubt and negativity in my head.",3,1760298627.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

*(Flowers R. Blooming)*¬†

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

There once was a man named Flowers Reginald Blooming. He lived a few blocks away from me, down the street. I used to see him almost every day on my way to school. As a kindergarten kid, hand in hand with my mother or father, I would always see him tending to some wildflowers or petting a stray cat or pouring out water for the dogs. He would wave at me, I would wave back, all smiles, having never been taught shame yet. And so it was, until I graduated from kindergarten.¬†

‚Ä¶

I graduated from kindergarten, then moved into elementary school, which was luckily still near my home. I began to attend football practice on the weekends, and so would again see Mr. Blooming on the way to the field. Sometimes I‚Äôd see him napping underneath a tree. Sometimes he'd be sitting at a cafe, sipping on a coffee, reading a newspaper. Sometimes, he‚Äôd be smelling the flowers in the meadows.¬†

‚Ä¶

Elementary was long, and it was hard. Looking back, I think it was too many years to ask me to sit still for. I still saw Mr. Blooming nearly every day, but as the years dragged on, as the pencil marks on the doorframe multiplied. As my clothes grew too small, then too long, then too small, then too long again. Mr. Blooming was still around, tending to his flowers, or feeding his strays, or sipping on his coffee, or taking his naps underneath his trees, or flying his favourite kite. And so it was, for most of the years of elementary school.

‚Ä¶¬†

But the wrinkles on his forehead and the sag of his cheeks did not go unnoticed. It took him more effort to bend over and tip the bag of food for the cats. He groaned more often and took longer when getting up from his naps underneath his trees. The water bowl for the stray dogs ran dry more often. His kite slowly lost its colour from the layer of dust that developed on its shell. By the time I graduated from elementary school, his kite had fallen into disrepair.

‚Ä¶¬†

With the end of elementary came junior high school. It did not improve. Struggle followed me through those halls all the same. The junior high was a drive away from my home. Every morning, I donned the uniform that did not fit me right around the stomach and neck and thighs, and I climbed into a car that I wished to stay in forever, after getting out of a bed that I wish I did not have to leave.¬†

‚Ä¶

Looking out the car window, I would still see Mr. Blooming, now standing and peering up at his trees and the sky. Or, I could find him sitting in his chair at the cafe, sipping on his coffee. He wore a hat now, I thought it was because he wanted to hide a bald spot that was forming. He wore coats and jackets more often now. The bowls of kibble and water were now more often empty than they were filled. And so it was, for the duration of junior high.¬†

‚Ä¶

I graduated junior high, and my mother found me a senior high she thought I‚Äôd enjoy more. ‚ÄúAway with the uniform!‚Äù she said, though it was never really the issue. The senior high school was a car ride and a train ride away. And so it was, climbing into a car earlier than ever in the morning, carrying a bookbag that was often too damn heavy, to get to a train that was always too bloody crowded. I usually spent those car rides sleeping, or listening to music, trying to prepare myself for the day ahead, and all the expectations it‚Äôd bring. Truth be told, I stopped looking for Mr. Blooming. I do not know where he went, or where he had gone, or who, or if, someone had taken him away. I spent the first few years like this, ignoring the coming and goings or the world outside the window. I missed Mr. Blooming often I think. I sometimes wonder just how many times it really was.¬†

‚Ä¶

There were still moments, I think, I caught glimpses of him. Rounding the street corner, I could almost swear I saw his coattails disappearing behind a tree. On really sunny days, ones without a cloud in the sky, it was as if I could almost make out the shape of a kite in the middle of the blinding sunlight. The cafe he always sat at never seemed to seat anyone at his table, or even move his chair when a group that was too large came in. There was sometimes a clearing in the pile of leaves underneath shedding trees.¬†

‚Ä¶

Senior high was close to coming to a close. A few months out, university applications coming and going, dread and excitement and everything in between for the future was all anyone could really think about. But, sometimes, on the car ride, or the crowded train ride, I would look out those windows, and I would see a tree or a sky or a stray or a cafe, and I could think of nothing else but breaking out from the car or train.¬†

‚Ä¶

I am now in university, with far too much time on my hands, in a room that is far too quiet. I have a hard time recognizing the boy I see in the mirror sometimes. I look down and all I see is the body of a boy, trapped in this suit of flesh that people usually accept as being some sort of adult.¬†

‚Ä¶

I tried to look for Mr. Blooming. I thought maybe he‚Äôs seen that little toddler, or that shy little boy, or that tired kid, or that impatient and angry teenager, or the lost and scared ‚Äúperson‚Äù. I tried his cafe and his dusty table. I tried the corner with his rusty metal bowls. I tried his tree stumps. I tried the overgrown meadows. I tried the empty skies. I continued to try until my mother noticed after I failed one of my tests. After she found out, she told me Mr. Blooming died years ago. I knew that simply was not true. But, alas, I could not find him. I do not know if I ever did.¬†

‚Ä¶

I try to remember Flowers. I try to remember how he treated strays. I try to remember how he sat and sipped his coffees. I try to remember the kite that he flew. I try to remember how he slept underneath those trees.¬†

‚Ä¶

I may be the fool. For those strays are no longer here nor are they alive anymore. Those trees have been cut back or chopped down. Those cafes have been replaced with corporate or profit-driven establishments. And who the hell flies a kite anymore? Maybe Flowers was a fool to begin with, and I am just following in the clumsy and messy footsteps of a thing that didn‚Äôt know what he wanted or was going.¬†

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

I am not convinced that Flowers is dead. Too many empty tables. Too many fat and happy strays. Too many spots suspiciously devoid of fallen leaves. I am not convinced Flower is dead.¬†

‚Ä¶

I think I should feed the strays at my university. In his name, of course. Probably.¬†

‚Ä¶

*(\[ I \] wonder if Mr. Blooming was ever real ‚Äì or if he, like a lot of the other things I remember seeing, was just something else my child-mind made up to explain something I couldn‚Äôt understand.)*

1o4ytjd,https://i.redd.it/cw787eikjquf1.jpeg,Paid with rewards and returning,Hello! I paid my entire order with points ($69 worth). I see an option to do drop offs at staples which I‚Äôd like to do as it‚Äôs more convenient for me but the return amount doesn‚Äôt mention any recovery of points. Can anyone confirm that I would receive the points back to my account the same as an in-store return? Thanks!,0,1760298623.0,Oldnavy,1,0.5,False

Accent chair or getting an additional one seater for the sofa to turn it into a 3-seater? 2 seater doesn't feel big enough.

I got a lot of comments about the mismatch between the lamps. I've tried placing it next to the piano to make it look more like a music area (thanks to the person who suggested this idea). Does this work? 

The coffee table is now out of proportion, would a round one or a square one work? 

I also got a lot of comments about the overwhelming beige. I'm adding browns and some green. Next thing on my to do list is painting an accent wall behind the sofa. I'm thinking limewash, any ideas?

1o4yrfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o4yrfq/the_portraits_in_the_kremlin/,The Portraits in the Kremlin,"

A few weeks ago, my Israeli friend‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him Eliav‚Äîdid something simple that shook me in a way I can‚Äôt explain.

He took off his glasses.

His piercing blue eyes, suddenly naked and sharp, met mine‚Äîice-cold, unblinking. I froze. My whole body trembled, and I started muttering to myself in Mandarin, ‚ÄúÂ§©ÂïäÔºåÂ§™ÂèØÊÄï‰∫Ü‚Ä¶‚Äù (God, this is terrifying).

He frowned. ‚ÄúAngel, get over yourself,‚Äù he said dryly.

But his eyes‚Äîthose eyes‚Äîreminded me of Leon Trotsky‚Äôs in those old portraits: intelligent, defiant, but somehow cursed.

That night, I had a dream.

Eliav, my boyfriend Antonio, my best friend Alexa, and I were inside the Kremlin. The hallways were endless and drenched in a strange red glow. On the walls hung massive portraits‚ÄîStalin, Trotsky, Grace Kelly, Henry Kissinger‚Äîwatching us as Swan Lake played faintly from somewhere far away, the violins echoing like ghosts.

Eliav stood before Trotsky‚Äôs portrait. The painting seemed to breathe. As he stared, his skin began to wrinkle, his hair turned white, and before my eyes he transformed into an old man.

Antonio stepped toward Stalin‚Äôs portrait‚Äîhis face hardened, his jawline aged, his youth drained away. Alexa wandered toward Grace Kelly and Henry Kissinger, and the light shifted‚Äîher reflection in the golden frame flickered, showing her face changing with each note of the ballet.

Then‚ÄîAntonio shoved Eliav down the grand staircase. His body shattered into a pile of bones that clattered across the marble.

Alexa gasped and stumbled backward, uncovering a hidden compartment behind one of the walls. Inside was an old black-and-white photo of my maternal grandpa when he was twenty-six, wearing his PLA uniform. On the back was a handwritten note:

 ‚ÄúÊàë‰ª¨‰∏ç‰∏ÄÂÆöÈúÄË¶ÅÁî∑Â≠©Â≠êÊù•ÂΩìÈ¢ÜÂØºÔºåÂ•≥Â≠©Â≠êÁÖßÊ†∑ÂèØ‰ª•ÂΩì‰∏çÈîôÁöÑÈ¢ÜÂØº„ÄÇ‚Äù
 ""We don‚Äôt necessarily need boys to be leaders. Girls can be great leaders too.""

Before I could process it, my *paternal grandma* appeared out of the shadows, her voice soft but urgent:
‚ÄúÂ≠©Â≠êÔºåÂø´Ëµ∞„ÄÇ‚Äù 

She handed Alexa a golden apple. Alexa ran toward the window, leapt‚Äîand a black swan swooped beneath her just in time, carrying her away. In the distance, a red swan flew over the water, dropping bright red berries‚Äîczerwone jagody‚Äîas a Polish folk song began to play.

Then I woke up.

The next morning, I met up with Eliav for coffee. I couldn‚Äôt look him in the eyes. I even dressed up‚Äîbougie, like Audrey Hepburn‚Äîwith a dress and sunglasses, trying to look like someone untouched by nightmares.

Eliav was particular as always‚Äîabout his food, his clothes, his cologne... and maybe, I realized uneasily, his women.

He let me sip his coffee. Later, we shared a drink using one straw.

And as I tasted the mix of caffeine and his cologne, I caught a glimpse of his reflection in the caf√© window.

For a second, he looked like Trotsky again.

And I swear‚Äîhe winked.

1o4yr6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1o4yr6n/still_not_getting_strong_coffee_from_my_delonghi/,Still not getting strong coffee from my DeLonghi Rivelia (especially for larger drinks) ‚Äì what am I doing wrong?,"Hey everyone,

A while ago I bought a DeLonghi Rivelia fully automatic coffee machine. I‚Äôve already asked a few questions here before, but after using it for about a month, I still have some frustrations and doubts.

My biggest issue: the coffee just isn‚Äôt strong enough ‚Äî no matter what I try. I‚Äôve used different beans (cheap, expensive, dark roast, light roast, etc.) and I keep reading everywhere that if you set the grinder to a finer setting (closer to 0), the coffee should be stronger.

Now, the Rivelia lets you adjust the grind size from 1 to 7 (with 4 being the default). But when I go below 4 ‚Äî even with the same type of beans ‚Äî the machine simply jams. It literally blocks because it can't pump/push the water through the coffee anymore, it also says it on the display btw.

Is that normal? And if it is, then why even give me steps lower toward 1 if the machine can‚Äôt handle it anyway? It just feels weird.



Apart from that, the coffee itself is *fine*, but whenever I want a larger cup, for example by selecting a ‚ÄúLong‚Äù coffee, the machine simply adds a more water. The result is a watery, see-through drink. I usually use a glass so I can see it, and honestly, it looks ridiculous.

I get that there‚Äôs a difference between a double espresso and a long coffee, but even regular milk-based drinks taste way too weak to me. I wouldn‚Äôt mind if the machine grounds twice the amount of beans for larger drinks ‚Äî I just want a strong cup! Nobody wants watery coffee‚Ä¶ or am I the only one? Am I just a bad coffee drinker?

I even tried making an Americano, using the ‚ÄúTo-Go‚Äù option ‚Äî where it brews directly into a travel mug or thermos. But again, same issue: it makes a big coffee, yet only grinds once. The result is basically hot water with a faint coffee flavor.

I honestly don‚Äôt get it anymore. What am I doing wrong? Any advice from other Rivelia owners (or people with similar DeLonghi machines) would be super appreciated.

1o4yps0,https://www.reddit.com/r/reading/comments/1o4yps0/pandabake_a_taiwanese_private_baker_making_light/,"PandaBake, a Taiwanese private baker making light cream cakes for pickup or delivery from Lower Earley","We first tasted one of [PandaBake](https://www.pandabake.co.uk/)'s cakes at a friend's birthday party, where we were shocked by how light and fluffy the strawberry roll cake was. It was just like the cakes we're used to from Asia! A friend gave it the ultimate Asian compliment of ""**It's not too sweet!**"" We asked our friend where she got the cake from, and it turns out that it was just a one-woman operation, baking cakes to order. Our friend works for Huawei, which regularly orders from her. That's how we first discovered Junyi.

Since then, we've ordered 2 cakes from her. The first time were 2 half roll cakes and we picked it up for free from her house in Lower Earley. Yesterday, we ordered a ¬£40 whole cake for my sister-in-law's birthday. This most recent experience is the reason why I'm writing this up now, as it was truly transcendent and my sister-in-law literally said it was the **best cake she's ever had**!

[6\\"" round Tropical Mango whole cake](https://preview.redd.it/m629593ybquf1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fed5bcbf02a8879c45fa8545854878414e14225)

Junyi drove over to our house yesterday afternoon to deliver it herself, and reminded us to keep it in the fridge due to the fresh cream. We opened the box, and it looked even better than on the website! We put it in the fridge and couldn't wait to tuck in later.

[Cross-section](https://preview.redd.it/4idsuf7hcquf1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40d27842819cb1b6ce3e27d5e2e8fe676e236028)

After dinner, we cut it into eighths and were amazed at how delicious it is. Cakes in Far East Asia are generally lighter and not as sweet as cakes in the UK. They're less chocolate based, and more often fresh fruit and cream based. This one was exactly like what we were used to, except with higher quality ingredients. The mangoes were a deep orange, with a puree that tasted like Alphonsos. The cream was light yet indulgent at the same time, surely double cream that she whipped herself. The cake was fluffy and heavenly, as if you're biting into a souffl√©. Lots of egg whites were needed to make that happen. Even the meringue was delicious and I'm normally not a fan. Everyone round the table loved it, we were only regretful that we finished it so quickly!

[Strawberry & cream half roll cake\/Yuzu matcha half roll cake](https://preview.redd.it/mw7whdnjequf1.jpg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dffb1508bba37a954a5647133481e59d1aa79c7)

The other cake we had ordered first from her were 2 half roll cakes - **strawberry & cream vs. yuzu matcha**. These were cheaper than the whole cakes (¬£26 for 2 halves), and you get to try more flavours. They were still pretty and delicious, but we thought because they start as sheet cakes with less height to work with, the unique fluffiness could not shine as it did in the whole cake.

[Flavours leaflet](https://preview.redd.it/fyywqjdvequf1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90e735bb6d6014a574f380546901b829cac872ad)

And the flavours, what flavours! From classic flavours like lemon or coffee, to more adventurous flavours like lychee or durian! I foresee a lifetime ahead of trying various flavours until either of us move away. 

In this Instagram world of ours, it's rare to find cakes that both look good and taste good, yet we've found it here in PandaBake. I would trust Junyi with my wedding cake if we were to get married again. Look through her [website](https://www.pandabake.co.uk/) and see if there's anything that catches your fancy. Or look through her [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PandaBake/photos?locale=en_GB) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pandabakeuk/?hl=en-gb) galleries for some bespoke designs that truly allow her to flex her decorative skills. 

We did all the ordering and payment via Whatsapp, she does need some advance notice since she needs to plan around her customers. The cakes are not cheap, but I think it's worthwhile as a treat for such high quality cakes to support a local business, everything is handmade and hand decorated herself. Since both Patisserie Valerie and the Lola's locker closed in Reading, there's been less choice for celebrations, whilst Paul is pretty expensive too. Hope you get a chance to taste one too sometime, enjoy! :)",3,1760298373.0,reading,0,0.71,False

We‚Äôre a married couple‚Äî38M and 35F‚Äîlooking to explore a closed polyfidelity relationship (F+F+M). We're fairly new to polyamory and taking things slow, starting with friendship and seeing where the connection leads. Ideally, we‚Äôre hoping to find a woman in the 25‚Äì40 age range who is emotionally available, not already in a relationship, doesn‚Äôt want kids of her own but is comfortable being around children, as we have a toddler and plan to have one more. Must be self sufficient as we dont plan on having you move in right away until we get to that bridge in the relationship. We both love playing games when time permits and do love playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends if given the opportunity. We also play video games such as minecraft!

üë© About Her (35F):

Loves cuddling


Identifies as a bratty sub, open to discovering her dynamic with the right person

Emotionally open, caring, and very nurturing


üë® About Me (38M):

Night owl but flexible; I can match morning energy when needed üòâ

High sex drive, into kink, and would love a partner who is sexually adventurous

Big fan of anime, camping, hiking, gardening, going to the gym, and DIY home upgrades

Handy, protective, and love building things that last.

Emotionally grounded and genuinely invested in creating a warm, balanced lifestyle.


üíï What We're Looking For:

A woman who is kind, emotionally mature, adventurous, kinky, and genuinely interested in building a closed throuple dynamic (just the three of us‚Äîno outside partners)


You should be STD-free, ideally childfree (but okay with kids being part of the picture)


Open to eventually living together (we're open to long-distance for now, as long as the goal is to close that gap)


Someone who is either already into homesteading or finds the idea of building a hobby homestead as a safe haven / retirement dream exciting


Comfortable starting out as friends and growing the connection naturally

I have the below setup, I've run it for about 8 years or so and have finally gotten fed up of the FPS drops so I come to you more learned folks to help me identify the problem.

The only upgrade I've ever done is the PSU, as it eventually died (as they do)

This is the setup right now, the GPU heat is a bit high but tbf I am running Space Marine 2 which is a pretty intense game. Could that be the cause? I have had intermittent FPS drops as long as I have had this computer, so that would be quite surprising given the GPU was only about 3 months out from being the newest in the market when I bought it.

I was recently told I‚Äôm in the *prediabetes* range (A1c 6.3). In July from a blood test. My doctor said it‚Äôs still technically ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù but that I should start paying attention to my lifestyle and diet so I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reading lately.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve gathered so far:

* Cut out sugary drinks (juice, soda, coffee shop drinks).
* Reduce or completely avoid sweets, candy, desserts, and anything high in sugar.
* Increase fiber, and reduce white carbs (rice, bread, pasta, etc.).
* If I *do* have something sweet, pair it with fiber or protein to blunt the spike.
* Avoid eating late at night.
* Reduce saturated fats.
* Move a lot and sleep early.

I‚Äôve already lost quite a bit of weight I used to be **270 lbs**, and now I‚Äôm **202 lbs**. I don‚Äôt really eat rice or bread anymore, and I‚Äôm planning to start **resistance training** soon to build some muscle.

One thing I‚Äôm still unclear about when people say you can have sweets ‚Äúoccasionally,‚Äù what does that actually mean? Once a week? Only on holidays?

Would love to hear how others have managed their prediabetes or reversed it!

I also started reading about hemoglobin E traits in the South Asian diaspora it‚Äôs interesting how that genetic trait can cause anemia-like symptoms. I come from a South Asian family, and we had a bad habit of eating late at night, around 10 p.m., usually rice and other carbs. I‚Äôve cut out a lot of that now.

[https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/9731-a1c](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/9731-a1c) (scroll down where they talk about the hemoglobin traits for different peoples) 

  
[https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/h/hemoglobin-e-trait.html](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/h/hemoglobin-e-trait.html)

Hemoglobin E trait is an inherited blood disorder. That means it's passed down through your parent‚Äôs genes. It leads to an abnormal form of hemoglobin that may cause mild anemia. It occurs most often in people of Southeast Asian descent.\\

  
Hemoglobin E/thalassemia. This means you have one hemoglobin gene from one parent, and a beta-thalassemia gene from the other parent. In this disease, the hemoglobin E causes anemia symptoms.

Looking for someone with whom we share our lives, someone who's gonna be there when everyone else leaves, someone who's gonna be the shoulder (and I'll be theirs) when we cry.

As mentioned in the title, I will be going to Colombia this December for 2.5 weeks and I am looking to see if my itinerary isn't too rushed or if I'm staying at certain places too long or too short. Basically all the things you get paranoid about when planning a trip.

Here is how it currently looks:

* **December 4-7th: Cartagena**
   * Getsemani, Walled City, Rosario Islands
* **December 7-10th :Santa Marta/Taganga**
   * Scuba diving, Tayrona National Park (just for the day, not actually sleeping in Cabo San Juan)
* **December 10-13th: Minca**
   * Seeing the waterfalls, bird watching, coffee tour and generally relaxing
* **December 13-16th: Medellin**
   * City Square, Botero Park. Communa 13, daytrip to Guatape
* **December 16-19th: Salento**
   * Valle de Cocora, Plaza di Bolivar
* **December 19-22nd: Bogota**
   * Botero and Gold Museum, Monserrate, Plaza Bolivar

My main niggles is sort of around the second half of the trip. Am I staying too much time in Minca for example? When I go abroad, especially faraway, I have a tough time relaxing and want to see as much as possible with the time I have. And is that time maybe eating away at Medellin, which when you put traveling there by plane into account, would mean I would only really have one real day in the city if I do a day trip to Guatape.

I'm prioritizing ease-of-use; I know that if I get a manual grinder and a manual coffee maker like a french press or pour-over, it's going to end up collecting dust in my cabinets. 

The cheapest automatic setup I've been able to find with no plastic touching the beans or water comes out to about $1000.

Grinder: https://www.option-o.com/shop/p/lagom-casa ~$550

Drip Brewer: https://simplygoodcoffee.com/products/the-brewer-plastic-free ~$450

1o4yewj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o4yewj,Step by Step ü©µ Office Slow Burn Perfection,"I didn‚Äôt plan to write about Step by Step because it hasn‚Äôt been one of those dramas that sends me spiraling with thoughts or reactions.  It‚Äôs just quietly enjoyable. But that‚Äôs exactly what makes it special.

Step by Step feels like a calm coffee break: steady, romantic, and grounded. Sometimes you just need a BL that feels like a warm, slow-brewing cup of coffee ‚òïü©µ

The workplace dynamic feels real without being dull. It‚Äôs one of those rare BLs where you can actually imagine these people having morning meetings and coffee breaks. The slow-burn romance builds so naturally through glances, small gestures, and unspoken moments that by the time something finally happens, it feels completely earned.

I really enjoyed the age and maturity difference between the main couple.  It adds a nice layer of realism and tension. The secondary couple has great chemistry too, and even the minor third couple is surprisingly cute. Honestly, I‚Äôm here for all the couples üòç

I loved seeing Mark Sorntast‚Äôs cameo.  His little two-episode ship is adorable, and it was such a fun surprise! üòÄ

**The build-up**

The unofficial date vibes in episode 6 ü•∞ The tension üòÆ‚Äçüí®

Episode 8 is deceptively steamy for a show that‚Äôs technically still in the pre-kiss phase üòè

That whole episode is one long emotional and visual flirtation.  The lighting, the casual intimacy, the subtle touches, and the way Jeng looks at Pat‚Ä¶ all of it gives strong we‚Äôre-already-a-couple energy. They‚Äôre fully in that ‚Äúsoft launch‚Äù stage: unspoken attraction, mutual awareness, and domestic comfort disguised as ‚Äújust hanging out.‚Äù

The dance scene is pure serotonin.  It‚Äôs one of those rare moments where all the work tension melts away and you just see them being themselves together. The way Jeng looks at Pat says everything.  He‚Äôs completely smitten but trying to play it cool.

It‚Äôs also a key turning point where their dynamic shifts from to something more equal and emotionally open. After that, the chemistry stops simmering quietly and starts to glow.

That‚Äôs part of why Step by Step feels so mature.  It leans on atmosphere and tension rather than rushing physical moments. When the kiss finally lands in episode 10, it carries extra weight precisely because of those earlier ‚Äúdate vibes.‚Äù


**Confession Rejection**

Then the usually composed and put-together Jeng breaking down in front of his brother after his confession to Pat is rejected ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫

That scene hits so hard because Jeng has been the epitome of calm and control up to that point and then suddenly you see him completely unravel.

You can feel how much he‚Äôs been bottling up. It‚Äôs not just heartbreak; it‚Äôs years of restraint, vulnerability, and longing finally surfacing. And his brother‚Äôs quiet, steady presence makes it even more powerful.

That moment completely humanizes Jeng.  It‚Äôs the first time he stops being ‚Äúthe boss‚Äù and becomes a man in love who‚Äôs hurting ü•∫

**The payoff**

The kitchen counter scene was perfection. The way Jeng clears space, steps in close, and lifts Pat onto the counter so naturally.  Both dominant and tender at the same time. It‚Äôs such a satisfying payoff after all that tension between them. 

And then the car makeout? ü•µ Confined space, low lighting, long day, bottled-up attraction finally snapping.  Cinematic gold üòÆ‚Äçüí®

Both scenes hit that perfect Step by Step balance: mature chemistry, not rushed, but undeniably passionate. You can feel the weight of everything they‚Äôve held back.


**Break up & Resolution**

I love how Put isn‚Äôt a toxic ex.  He even encourages Pat to clear things up with Jeng. Normally I‚Äôm not a fan of breakup tropes or time skips, but here it never felt depressing or dragged out.

And the karaoke serenade to get back together? üé§ Yes, please üòç

Their reconciliation destroyed me üò≠üò≠üò≠ Jeng saying he‚Äôs afraid he‚Äôll hurt Pat again, both of them apologizing, Jeng crying when Pat hugs him. Absolutely beautiful ü•≤

**The ensemble**

Another thing Step by Step quietly excels at: the supporting cast actually feels like real people, not filler or comic relief.

Each of them adds texture to the story, making the show feel like a lived-in world where everyone has their own motivations, flaws, and small victories. That ensemble quality is what makes Step by Step feel so mature.  It‚Äôs not just a love story, it‚Äôs an ecosystem of people learning and growing around each other.

This series finds that perfect balance. Enough tension and angst to keep you hooked, but never too much. Not too fluffy, not too heavy. Just right. üëåüèª",1,1760297681.0,boyslove,0,0.67,False

1o4yeak,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1o4yeak/my_love_affair_with_coffee_childhood_story/,My love affair with coffee (childhood story),"Hey coffee lovers,

I thought I‚Äôd share a small story from my life (I‚Äôm 32 M now) ‚Äî one that goes all the way back to 2007, when I was a 14-year-old kid growing up in Kota, Rajasthan.

Back then, we all knew only one kind of coffee ‚Äî instant coffee. And honestly, I loved it. My mom had this special coffee recipe that she‚Äôd make only on rare occasions, something she had learned from her elder brother. That was my first introduction to the comforting aroma and sweet kick of coffee ‚Äî and I was instantly hooked.

That same year, I became friends with a boy whose family was originally from Kerala, though they lived in Rajasthan. My teenage, stereotypical brain assumed, ‚ÄúWell, they‚Äôre from Kerala, so they must be drinking amazing coffee at home all the time!‚Äù

One day, out of pure curiosity, I asked him whether his family drank any special kind of coffee. He smiled, and the very next day he surprised me with a small jar of roasted coffee beans.

It was the first time I‚Äôd ever seen actual coffee beans. I had no idea how to make coffee from them. So, naturally, I asked him. He was also 14 and told me with total confidence:

‚ÄúJust grind them in a mixer grinder, boil them, and strain it ‚Äî that‚Äôs it!‚Äù

Armed with this ‚Äúexpert‚Äù advice and zero actual knowledge, I took my mom‚Äôs mixer grinder, dumped the beans in, and ground them into what I thought was the right texture. In reality, it was a coarse grind, but I assumed it would work just like instant coffee.

I boiled some milk, added the coarse coffee grounds, and waited. I could smell the coffee ‚Äî that familiar aroma was definitely there ‚Äî but something felt off. The powder wouldn‚Äôt dissolve in the milk. I tried straining it, but it turned into a complete mess.

And that, my friends, was my very first interaction with real coffee beans, grinding, and preparation. A total failure, but a story that still makes me smile every time I think about it.

P.S. The coffee my mom used to make back then is the very same one that later became famous worldwide during the Covid lockdown ‚Äî Dalgona Coffee!",2,1760297640.0,IndiaCoffee,3,1.0,False
1o4yd2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o4yd2l/the_performance_never_ends/,The performance never ends.,"I'm writing this from my car because I need to get it down before I talk myself out of what I just saw. My hands are shaking, and the rain hasn't stopped.

My headlights burned out three days ago‚Äîthe regular ones, not the high beams‚Äîand I kept meaning to replace them but work has been brutal and I just kept putting it off. So tonight, driving home on County Road 12, I'm running on high beams alone, and the rain is coming down in sheets, and I can barely see fifteen feet ahead of me.

That's when the fog bank appears.

It's dense. Unnaturally dense. I'm slowing down, my foot pressing lightly on the brake, and through the wall of white I see a shape. Small, low to the ground. A child, I think. Or a dog. Something living and solid and directly in my path.

I slam on the brakes, brace for impact, close my eyes‚Ä¶

Then nothing.

When I open them, I'm through the fog and there's only an empty road ahead, rain-slicked and black. My heart is hammering. I check the rearview mirror but the fog is already dissipating behind me, wisping away into nothing.

Just fog. Dense fog. I was seeing things.

I keep driving home.

I pass the Patchetts‚Äô farmhouse about two miles later. I've driven past it a thousand times. Their white house and red barn, that ancient oak in the front yard. Except tonight, as my high beams sweep across the property, I see Mrs. Patchett standing in her kitchen window.

She's washing dishes.

That's not strange; I know my neighbors well enough to know their daily routine. What's strange is the *way* she's doing it. Her hands move in precise circles, over and over, the same motion, but there's something mechanical about it. Performative, like she's playing the role of someone washing dishes rather than actually cleaning them.

And her face. I only see it for a second as I pass, but her face is pointed straight at the window, and her expression is completely blank. Not tired, not thoughtful. Blank. Empty.

I tell myself I'm seeing things again. The adrenaline from almost hitting something is making me paranoid. Mrs. Patchett is just tired. It's late. People zone out all the time when they do dishes.

I keep driving.

Another fog bank appears about a mile later, thicker this time. I slow to a crawl.

This time, I see other cars. Three of them, heading the opposite direction. Their headlights cut through the fog like searchlights, and for just a moment‚Äîjust a flash‚ÄîI see the drivers and my face contorts into something ugly.

They're not driving. They're consuming.

I don't know how else to describe it. Their mouths are slightly open, their eyes fixed forward, and they're no longer just people commuting home from work or running errands. They're feeding. The motion itself‚Äîthe act of going, taking space, moving forward‚Äîthey're devouring it. Like the distance is something they need to swallow just to keep existing.

One of them is a woman in a sedan. As we pass each other, she turns her head slightly and our eyes meet through the fog and rain.

There's nothing behind her eyes. Nothing at all. Just the desperate, automatic performance of being a person driving a car.

Then I'm through the fog again, and my hands are gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles are white.

I pull over. I need to pull over.

I'm at a turnout overlooking Miller's Pond. I put the car in park and I'm breathing too fast. This is shock. This is my brain misfiring because I almost hit something and my nerves are shot and I haven't been sleeping well and‚Äî

I look down at my phone and keep typing because I need to write it down. I need someone to see this before I convince myself none of it happened.

Okay, I'm calmer now. I've been sitting here for maybe ten minutes, gulping air to fill my lungs then slowly exhaling to calm my nerves. The rain is lighter, my breathing has slowed, and my heart isn‚Äôt fluttering like a trapped animal behind my ribs anymore.

I can see the lights of town from here, scattered across the valley like dropped coins. People in their homes, living their lives. Their very normal lives.

I'm going to finish driving home. It's only another three miles up the road. Maybe someone can tell me I'm having a panic attack or that there's some kind of gas leak making me hallucinate. Something rational.

There's a 24-hour gas station at the edge of town. I wasn't planning to stop, but my tank is nearly empty and I don't want to deal with it tomorrow morning.

I pull in. The fluorescent lights are too bright after driving in the dark, and they make everything look washed out and artificial. There's only one other car here‚Äîa blue pickup truck at pump three.

I get out. The rain has stopped but the air is heavy with moisture, and I can see my breath.

The man at pump three is filling his tank. I recognize him. David something‚Äîhe works at the hardware store. I've bought paint and light bulbs from him, the kind of routine interactions you have in a small town where you're not quite friends but you know each other's faces.

He sees me and nods. I nod back.

I start pumping gas, and then the fog rolls in.

It comes from nowhere, thick and low, its tendrils pooling around the pumps like something alive. David is still standing there, watching his pump, and I'm watching him, and the fog is rising.

His hand is on the pump handle, but he's not looking at the numbers. He's looking at nothing. And I can see it now‚Äîreally see it‚Äîthe way I couldn't before.

He's hollow.

Not metaphorically. I can see the shape of him, the outline of a man in a jacket holding a pump, but there's nothing inside. No thoughts, no feelings, no‚Ä¶self. Just the performance itself. The learned behavior of being David-at-the-gas-station, executing the script: pump gas, check numbers, replace nozzle, get receipt, drive away.

And underneath it all, underneath the performance, there's just this desperate, gnawing need to do something, to keep moving because stopping means facing the emptiness.

He's feeding on the act of completing tasks, on the illusion that any of it‚Äîany of *this*‚Äîmeans anything at all.

The fog thickens and I see myself in the reflection of my car window.

Oh god.

Oh god, I'm doing it too.

I'm standing here pumping gas at night because that's what people do. That's what I'm supposed to do. And I'm going to drive home and I'm going to walk inside and I'm going to make coffee or check my email or watch something on my phone, and every single action is just me trying to fill the void. Trying to convince myself I'm not hollow.

But I am.

We all are.

David-something gets in his truck and drives away as the fog is starting to clear.

My pump clicks off. I replace the nozzle. I get my receipt.

I perform the script.

I drive another seven minutes down the street, and I'm home now.

I've been sitting in my driveway for twenty minutes, staring at my front door.

Inside is my life. My furniture, my routines, my carefully constructed existence. The person I pretend to be when I wake up and make coffee and go to work and come home and do it all again.

But I can't unsee it now.

Every choice I make, every word I speak, every interaction with another person‚Äîit's all just a performance, an elaborate shared delusion that we're real, that we matter, that any of this means something.

And the worst part? The absolutely worst part?

I'm going to keep doing it.

I'm going to walk inside. I'm going to take off my coat. I'm going to brush my teeth and go to bed and wake up tomorrow and do it all again. Because what else is there?

So I'll keep performing. Keep consuming. Keep feeding the emptiness.

Just like everyone else.

I'm posting this now because maybe that's all we can do‚Äîreach out across the void, hoping someone else sees it too, hoping that sharing the horror makes it more bearable.

But I know better now.

This post is just another performance. Another way to fill the emptiness. I'm using your attention, your validation, your responses to convince myself I exist.

We're all doing it. Every post, every comment, every interaction‚Äîwe're all just hollow things trying to feel solid for a moment.

The fog didn't change anything, not really.

I need to go inside now. I need to keep performing. Because the alternative is admitting there's nothing to perform for.

1o4ybdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1o4ybdc/is_it_ok_to_now_decline_my_nephews_wedding/,"Is it OK to now decline my nephew's wedding invitation, because of me falling out with his dad?","For context - im Female, 44. Fell out with my brother last year. Hes emotionally abusive basically (which is the reason why I stopped contact) and has history of falling out with female family members. His wife/My sister in law, has slowly began to phase me out of things too. Things have become pretty untenable, insofar, it wont be long before she totally cuts contact (not like she kept in touch anyway tbf). He has 2 kids, and one of them is getting married in few weeks. 

Im fine with my nephew, but we dont have a relationship really. Likely stemming from his dad and I falling out. We bump into each other every couple of months in the area,  and its super friendly - theres no animosity or anything. Hes a lovely young man of 28.

My parents split up when I was 8. My mum is going the wedding, naturally, as her relationship is fine with my brother (though she'sunhappy he doesn't make effort, see her as much as I do). Im supposed to be going wedding with my mum.

My dad and step mum are going, begrudgingly,  because he is afterall my nephew's grandfather. They dont have a close relationship either. He was invited out of formality. The relationship I have with my mum and dad is difficult,  because I suffered from acute trauma because of their divorce. They have their own issues which make me feel worse (mum can be emotionally abusive, stone wall me etc.  Dad blows hot and cold). Ive only just got on good terms with my dad after an on and off relationship the last 20 years. Were in a good place, but my mum tolerates him at best when they end up in each other's company.

To be honest,  as a child (deep down) with childhood trauma issues, and an ongoing conflict with my brother, id rather not go the wedding now?

I don't want to. Im going through a difficult mental health period in my life right now (severe anxiety), and I can't think of anything worse than being surrounded by my mum,  dad, step mum AND a brother who I havent seen for 12 months, with a sister in law who is clearly on side with her husband now. Its not like the wedding is in the same city. Its a different part of country where I am expected to stay overnight. 

I honestly dont know why im going. Things have changed alot since I got the invite 18 months ago. Im just not in a good place and being around people who would trigger my trauma is too much to bare.

Would it be OK for me to decline the invite, by meeting up with my nephew for a coffee and explaining things?

To note - my brother fell out with a very close auntie of ours, whom he borrowed money from twice, and totally abused her position of trust. My nephew invited her too, but she had to politely decline, saying it 'wouldn't be a good idea'. He respected that and understood.

Now things have become basically untenable (because now my sister in law is making it obvious she is stepping back), is it reasonable and ok for me not to go the wedding?

Part I ‚Äî The Child of Applause

I used to believe the world was built for people like me.
The kind of people who finish thoughts before they begin, who see the answer waiting long before anyone else finds the question.
When I was a child, I thought that was what made life fair.
If I worked hard, if I kept thinking, if I kept winning, the world would always open another door.

Teachers called it potential.
My parents called it a blessing.
I called it normal, because I did not know any other way to be.

What I remember most about those years is not the noise of the classroom or the smell of chalk.
It is the quiet that came afterward, when everyone left and I was still there.
The kind of quiet that hums.
At first it sounded like the air conditioner.
Later I realized the sound came from somewhere else.
Inside me.
A vibration behind my eyes that pulsed when I focused.
When I solved a problem, it brightened.
When I hesitated, it dimmed.
I decided that was what genius sounded like.

By eight years old I understood that being different unsettled people.
If I finished a puzzle too fast, they frowned.
If I asked a question the teacher could not answer, they smiled, but it was the kind of smile adults use when they want you to stop talking.
So I started watching.
Not learning, watching.
The way other kids slouched in their chairs.
The way they whispered before the bell.
The way they laughed without earning it.
I studied those things until they became patterns I could copy.

When I laughed, they laughed back.
When I said something ordinary, they called it funny even when it was not.
I realized that people like rhythm more than truth.
If you move in time with them, they stop listening to what you are actually saying.

That was the first trick I ever learned.
It worked so well that it never left me.
I wore it the way some kids wore lucky shirts.
It made life easier.
It made me invisible in the right ways.

Home was quiet, too quiet.
My parents loved me, but their love had conditions they never spoke aloud.
Every conversation ended with a small reminder.
Keep it up.
Do not waste what you have been given.
They did not say it harshly.
It was just their way of telling me that love was earned through achievement.
I learned to perform for them the same way I performed for everyone else.
Perfect grades.
Clean room.
Polite smile.
No noise except the hum.

Sometimes I would lie awake and try to feel what other kids felt when they were proud.
All I could sense was motion.
Like gears turning somewhere deep in the dark part of my brain, too fast to stop.
The hum would rise until it filled the whole room, a sound without source, a reminder that there was still more to do.

By ten I was living for that sound.
It came whenever I learned something new, whenever I improved, whenever someone praised me.
It was like applause that only I could hear.
I did not need friends.
I did not need rest.
I just needed that vibration under my skin that told me I was still moving forward.

My teachers adored me.
They said I had focus, discipline, drive.
None of them knew that the focus was not a choice.
It was compulsion.
Stopping meant silence, and silence felt like drowning.

I filled my days with anything that kept the noise alive.
Piano lessons.
Science club.
Track team.
Every hour was another chance to feed the hum.

The first time I noticed something strange, I was eleven.
I had stayed late in the art room, sketching geometric patterns I could not stop drawing.
Concentric circles.
Perfect symmetry.
The teacher had gone home.
The school halls were empty.
Fluorescent lights buzzed above me, but the hum was louder than usual.
It had rhythm now, almost like breathing.

When I put the pencil down, I heard it shift.
Two short bursts of sound, sharp and hollow.
Clapping.
Not loud, not human.
Just the echo of hands that were not there.

I remember turning around slowly, expecting a janitor, a prank, anything.
Nothing.
Only the smell of paint thinner and the faint hiss of the lights.

I told myself I imagined it.
But that night, when I closed my eyes, the clapping returned.
Slow.
Measured.
One‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ pause‚Ä¶ one‚Ä¶ two.
The rhythm matched my heartbeat until I fell asleep.

Middle school blurred by like a film on fast forward.
Every new subject felt easy.
Every challenge ended the same way.
Applause, even when there was no one left to give it.
I learned to fake modesty because people liked it better that way.
When they said, you are so talented, I smiled and said, I just got lucky.
Inside, I felt the hum swell, warm and electric, as if luck were listening and proud of me for lying.

I started to think of the hum as a friend.
It never scolded me.
It never left.
It waited patiently for me to achieve, then rewarded me for doing so.
It made me better.
It made me feel less alone.

By high school I was living two lives.
There was the version of me everyone saw. Confident, balanced, polite.
And then there was the other one.
The one who could not sleep if a line of text was not aligned, who whispered answers under his breath to problems no one had asked, who stared at the ceiling at night waiting for the hum to return.
I told myself it was normal.
Everyone has something that keeps them going.
Mine just sounded different.

I remember walking home once after a debate tournament.
It was winter, late enough that the streets were empty.
I was replaying every argument in my head, every word that landed, every nod from the judges.
The city was silent except for the crunch of snow beneath my shoes.
Then the hum started again, soft but clearer than it had ever been.
It rose with each breath until I felt it vibrating through the streetlights.
For a moment the air shimmered, faintly, like heat on asphalt.
And in that shimmer I thought I saw movement.
Shadows leaning toward me as if listening.
Then it stopped, and the night fell still.
I stood there smiling, convinced that even the dark itself was applauding.

That was how it began.
Not with fear, not with horror, but with pride.
I thought the hum was proof that I was meant for something greater.
It made sense then.
Every genius has their process, their secret.
This was mine.
I did not understand that what I was hearing was not admiration.
It was appetite.

When the world around me grew quiet, it did not mean I was alone.
It meant something else was waiting for me to think again.

Part II ‚Äî The Quiet Years

Adulthood is a different kind of silence.
No bells.
No trophies.
No teachers who light up when you raise your hand.
There is work.
There are deadlines.
There is a clean apartment that does not care who you are when you unlock the door.

I became a data analyst because patterns felt like mercy.
You can drown in noise if you do not give it shape.
Spreadsheets became a religion.
I could stack meaning into columns and hide the emptiness between cells.
It paid enough.
It was respectable.
No one asked questions if you were good at numbers.

At first I tried to keep the childhood pace alive.
Courses at night.
Freelance projects on weekends.
Gym at five in the morning because running gave the hum a place to go.
I told myself I was building a life.
What I was building was momentum.

Years passed.
New hires came and went.
Supervisors changed.
The praise thinned out.
Everyone was busy with their own survival.
People stopped clapping.

The first time I noticed the difference, I had finished a large audit.
It took weeks.
It was perfect.
No one cared.
Two sentences in an email and a meeting that ran long.
I sat at my desk after everyone left and waited for the hum to swell the way it used to when something was done right.
It did not come.
I felt a space open inside me where the sound should have been.

I worked later that night.
I organized, reorganized, colored rows that did not need color.
I aligned headers and realigned them.
I told myself it was for clarity.
It was not.
It was ritual.
It was the old mask, put on for an empty room.

The silence grew teeth.
It did not feel like rest anymore.
It felt like a mouth.

I tried to fill the evenings.
Puzzles.
Online forums.
Short courses that promised to make me twice as productive in half the time.
I learned a new language until the grammar began to sound like numbers.
I learned a card game and memorized the deck patterns until no one wanted to play with me.

The hum returned in pieces.
Not the warm one from childhood.
This one came thin and bright, like a wire pulled too tight.
I would be chopping vegetables and the knife would hit the board in a rhythm that did not belong to me.
I would wake to my phone vibrating and realize it was not the phone.
It was a sound in the room, steady and patient, asking me to get up and do something worth listening to.

When I ignored it, it got louder.
When I gave in, it softened and spread through my chest like heat.

I started keeping a notebook beside the bed again.
Notes helped when I was young.
They might help now.
I wrote thoughts as they came.
Clean sentences.
Numbered lists.
Steps that would make tomorrow better.

One night I opened the notebook and found a page I did not remember writing.
The handwriting was mine.
The words were not.

Keep it moving.
Keep it even.
Keep it worthy.

I told myself I had written it in my sleep.
Habit.
Nothing more.

Another week passed.
I woke to the hum again.
I lay there and listened.
It matched my pulse.
I tried to slow my breathing and break the rhythm.
The sound adjusted.
It stayed with me.
I had the thought, uninvited, that it was learning.

I began drinking coffee at strange hours.
Midnight coffee meant I could work.
Working meant the hum would calm down.
Calm was better than the bright wire sound in my skull.
My apartment smelled like beans and old paper.
I took pride in the order.
Every object had a right angle.
Every cable was coiled and labeled.
If the world would not clap, at least my desk would approve of me.

There were days when I did not speak to anyone after five.
The mask did not fit right in empty rooms.
Without people to mirror, my face relaxed into something I did not show anyone.
A quiet, flat expression that felt efficient.
I would catch myself in the window at night and not recognize the shape.

Once, while washing dishes, I saw my reflection lag behind by a second.
Not because of the glass or the light.
My hand moved.
The hand in the window hung in place, then caught up.
It smiled when I did not.

I turned the kitchen light off and stood in the dark.
The hum came back at once, relieved, like I had finally allowed it to speak.

I started sleeping with a fan to drown it, the way I did in high school.
The white noise helped for a week.
Then I began hearing the hum underneath the fan.
It threaded itself through the sound.
No matter what I put on top, it found a way beneath.

I saw a doctor.
I told him I had tinnitus.
He asked about stress.
I said I worked a lot.
He said to take time off, go outside, find balance.
I went home and washed the sink twice because his advice left a residue on the counter that I could not see and could not stand.

Colleagues invited me to drinks on a Friday.
I went because I needed witnesses.
The mask still worked.
I knew how to make people comfortable.
Nod here.
Ask about their kids.
Miss a chance to make a joke so they can be the funny one.
They said I was easy to talk to.
They said I had it together.
I smiled and watched their eyes for the small cues that would let me move in time with them.

When I left the bar and walked into the night, the city felt thinner.
Streetlights stretched too far across the pavement.
My shadow had two edges.
The hum rose, pleased.
At the crosswalk I heard it split.
The low tone stayed with me.
A softer sound drifted to my left.
I looked.
No one was there.
Just a billboard with a blank white surface awaiting a new ad.
The white was not empty.
If I stared long enough, I could see the suggestion of an audience pressed into it.
A faint pattern like palms.

I went home and made tea I did not drink.
I opened the notebook to a new page.
I wrote a sentence to prove the world was real.
The pen moved.
The sentence formed.
I read it and felt the heat leave my hands.

You are most alive when they are watching.

The next morning I tore the page out and threw it away.
By lunch I had taken the bag to the chute because I did not trust the trash to stay still beside the sink.

Work assigned me to a new client.
They wanted a system that could predict behavior.
Sales, but they used the word behavior as if they were scientists.
I built the model.
I watched patterns shift in real time as people clicked things they did not need.
The project manager clapped when we hit the target.
It was the first real applause I had heard in months.
It felt like sunlight after a long winter.
That night the hum rocked me to sleep like a lullaby.

I began to understand the shape of the problem.
I was not bored.
I was starving.
The world of adults did not feed me.
The praise had dried up.
The stimulation had dulled.
The mask required an audience.
Without one, it hung on my face like damp cloth.

The hum did not want me to be content.
It wanted me to be seen.

‚∏ª

Part III ‚Äî The Reawakening

I started to chase projects that would put me in rooms where people noticed.
Presentations.
Whiteboards.
The smell of dry erase markers and the small gasp a room makes when a number surprises it.
I dressed better.
I timed my speech to the attention span of executives who measured time in costs.
They looked at me the way teachers used to.
Bright.
Useful.
Almost human.

The hum warmed me afterward.
In the elevator, alone, I could feel it along my spine like a hand.
Good.
Again.

I told myself I was in control.
I chose the work.
I chose the pace.
I chose the mask.
Then small things began to disobey.

My apartment door sometimes resisted my key for a second longer than physics allowed.
Emails I was certain I had sent were not in the outbox.
I kept two calendars to cross check.
Both would match for a week, then drift by a minute, then reconcile on their own.

At night the reflection in the black television screen started to feel crowded.
I do not own many things.
I keep a clean room.
Nothing to cast strange shapes.
Yet when I passed the screen, there would be a suggestion of people sitting in rows.
If I stood still, they faded and left only my face.

I told myself that the mind plays tricks when it is tired.
I told myself the hum had become a habit and would go away if I made new ones.
I stopped coffee for two days and woke with my heart hammering like a warning.
On the third day I made the strongest pot of my life and cried while I drank it because the relief felt like confession.

I tried to date.
It seemed like a reasonable solution.
Someone to witness me.
Someone to make me stop measuring my own pulse every time a room went still.
The first date was kind.
She laughed in the right places.
She asked careful questions.
She mentioned a podcast about high achievers and burnout.
I nodded and pretended to recognize myself.
When we said goodbye, she touched my arm and told me to get some sleep.
That night the hum went so quiet I searched the apartment with the refrigerator door open just to hear the compressor and know that the world had not stopped.

The second date noticed the mask.
She did not call it that.
She asked why my eyes went flat when I listened.
I told her I was focusing.
She said it felt like talking to someone behind glass.
She did not want to try again.

There was a third date.
It was worse.
She liked me instantly and I felt nothing.
I mirrored interest because I remembered that interest creates interest.
She reached for my hand and I let her.
She leaned in and I could not.
When she left, I stood in the hall and waited for the hum to judge me.
It did not.
The silence did.

At work I took on a side project that should have been two jobs.
The model needed to watch people in real time and shift its predictions as they changed their minds.
I wrote code until the letters swam.
I ate at my desk.
I slept at my desk once and woke to the sound of clapping with no hands.

When I looked up, the office was dark.
Emergency exit signs spilled a thin light across the carpet.
The glass walls reflected a room that was not mine.
Rows of chairs.
A stage.
I could not see who sat in the chairs, but I could feel the attention.
It sat on my skin like static.

I stood and the reflection stood a moment late.
In the glass, the crowd leaned forward.
In the room, there was just me.

I went home and told myself I was not well.
I promised to rest after the delivery.
I promised to call my mother and accept the small scolding she gives that sounds like love.
I promised to take a weekend with no screens.
I wrote these promises down and underlined them so the page would believe me.

The next morning the notebook held a new line in my handwriting.

Your promises are intermissions.
Get back on the stage.

I do not scare easily.
Fear requires belief.
Up to that point I believed in exhaustion and lonely habits, not in haunted glass.
Still, I tore the page, shredded it, ran water over the pieces until the ink bled into a blue cloud and the drain took it.

The hum did not punish me.
It did the opposite.
It gave me what I craved.
Work flowed.
Words arrived when I opened my mouth.
The client called the model elegant.
The room clapped for the first time in a year.
A real sound with real hands and no glass to confuse it.

In the elevator afterward, I did not press a floor.
I stood while the doors closed and listened.
The hum swelled and on top of it came the smaller sound it sometimes wears.
One‚Ä¶ two.
Pause.
One‚Ä¶ two.

I said, out loud, because no one was there to watch me, that is enough now.
The sound softened like an animal settling.
I felt loved.

That was the moment I should have feared.
Not the reflections.
Not the notebook.
The relief.
The love.
I did not earn it, yet it wrapped me the way praise used to wrap me, and I let it.

‚∏ª

Part IV ‚Äî The Breaking Pattern

Sleep began to slide.
I dreamed in clean rooms where microphones waited on empty stages.
I would step up to speak and wake with my mouth open and no air in my lungs.
I started counting my breaths to keep them steady.
By ten my heart would match the count.
By twenty the hum would match my heart.
By thirty I would forget which one started the rhythm.

I placed the desk against a different wall to change the room.
For two days the house felt new.
On the third day the light fell across the keyboard the way it used to.
Dust moved as if a hand had encouraged it.
The hum approved.

I stopped visiting my parents.
They live close enough for breakfast on Sundays.
I practiced what I would say on the drive and still could not prevent the mask from arriving before I did.
They looked older.
They looked proud of me and worried about me at the same time.
My mother asked if I was happy.
I said yes in the voice that sounds like yes even when it is not.
She told me to keep taking care of myself.
I promised I would.
In the bathroom I washed my hands until the water ran hot and the skin went red, then I stared into the mirror to be sure my face still knew how to be kind.

I left before lunch and sat in my car without starting it.
The silence inside the car was different from the silence in my apartment.
Smaller.
It pressed on my eardrums.
The hum filled it the way water fills a cup.
I rested my head on the wheel and whispered, I am trying.
I expected a voice.
Instead the engine started itself and stalled.
The key was not in the ignition.

I walked home.
I did not tell anyone because I did not want the story to sound like a story sick people tell.

At work the side project ended.
They thanked me.
They moved me to maintenance.
Small changes.
No presentations.
I watched the hum go still as a coin.

Three nights later my neighbor knocked.
He is polite, always a little out of breath from the stairs.
He asked if I was playing music late.
I said no.
He asked if I had guests.
I said no.
He apologized.
He said he heard clapping from my side of the wall and wanted to make sure the sound was not the plumbing.
We both laughed at that and promised to keep an ear out.

After he left I put my palm on the shared wall and waited.
Nothing at first.
Then a small vibration, the way a phone feels in a heavy jacket.
It did not feel like sound traveling through drywall.
It felt like the wall itself was glad I had touched it.

I slept on the couch because the bedroom felt like a stage where someone had forgotten to lower the curtain.
The television glass did not reflect a crowd that night.
It reflected one person sitting in the third row, center.
A silhouette with shoulders I recognized.
My own.

In the morning the reflection returned to normal.
My face.
My room.
The window with the clean line of light across the floor.

I went to the office and tried to keep my thoughts small.
Do the task.
Drink water.
Check the calendar twice.
Do not let the mind heat up.
Do not invite the hum.

At lunch I found myself in a supply closet with the door closed.
I do not remember walking there.
The air smelled like cardboard.
It felt safe.
No one expects a performance between shelving and spare toner.
I stayed long enough that someone asked if I felt sick.
I told them I was fine and went back to my desk where the spreadsheets waited with their quiet grid of permissions.

That night the notebook waited with a new message.
Short.
Three words.

They are bored.

I wrote beneath it.
Who.

The page stayed empty.
The paper was not the kind that bleeds ink unless you hold the pen there too long.
A dot formed under the question mark as if the page was trying to answer and could not.

I closed the book and turned the television on to break the room.
The news was a parade of disasters.
The hum grew bored with it faster than I did.
I muted the sound and watched the closed captions until the words started to move before the mouths.
I changed the channel to a nature show where nothing asked anything from anyone.
The hum quieted and then, insulted, slithered back to life behind my teeth.

I spoke to it.
I said, you do not get to decide.
The room blinked.
Not the lights.
The room.
A half second cut from the film of reality and spliced back in at the wrong frame.
The air felt one degree warmer.
The clock on the stove read a time that did not exist.

I stood very still and listened the way I used to listen before competitions, when calm meant victory.
The hum softened.
I breathed.
It breathed with me.

The next day I brought home a mirror from a thrift store because a solver solves.
If reflections were the mouth it used, I wanted to see the teeth.
The glass was old with a slight ripple.
I cleaned it until my arm ached.
I set it on the dresser where I would have to pass it to reach the bed.

At three in the morning I woke for no reason and found myself standing in front of the mirror with my hands at my sides.
My reflection did not stand.
It sat.
Third row, center.
It clapped once and the sound did not come from the room.
It came from the space between my ears.
A private applause that did not need air.

I touched the glass.
It was warm.
The warmth moved beneath my palm as if a pulse searched for another pulse.
My own face smiled from the chair and I felt the smile form on my lips a second later.
The delay broke me.
I stepped back.
The image corrected.
I sat on the bed and said the words I had refused to say since childhood.

Please stop.

The hum did.
It stopped so completely that the world felt emptied of current.
No fridge.
No pipes.
No neighbor‚Äôs radio.
It felt like being buried.
My heart ran fast inside that stillness, an animal trapped in a box.

I understood then what I had been feeding.
Not a voice.
Not a ghost.
A hunger that had learned to clap so I would work harder to deserve it.

‚∏ª

Part V ‚Äî The Gift

I took a week of vacation and stayed inside the apartment.
I kept the phone off except for one call to my mother that connected and never rang.
I watched old home videos because they were safe.
A past I could not edit.
I watched a seven year old boy line up blocks and build a tower that did not fall because his hands were careful.
He did not smile.
He checked the edges and adjusted them until they were perfect.
In the background my parents spoke softly about how bright he was.
The boy looked toward the camera like he heard a different conversation in the next room.

I paused the video and stared at my own face, small and serious.
I wanted to tell him to go outside.
I wanted to tell him to be average for one afternoon and see if the sky fell.
The mirror caught me watching myself and made the room more crowded than it should have been.

The notebook remained closed on the table.
On the third day the temptation to check it felt like thirst.
I told myself I would look once.
If there were words that I had not written, I would burn the book in the sink and watch the smoke leave through the vent.

I opened it.
Blank.
I turned pages.
Blank.
Relief arrived so fast it hurt.
Then I reached the middle and saw one paragraph, small and careful, in my hand.

You wanted this.
You asked for it when you were young and quiet and no one could see inside your head.
You said, let me be worthy of the sound.
I agreed.

I closed the book.
I did not burn it because fire would have felt like applause and I was trying to starve the room.

That night I dreamed in an empty theater.
I heard my shoes on the wood as I walked toward a microphone that did not need wires.
The seats were full.
Everyone was me.
They watched with the patience of mirrors.
I said, I am tired.
They nodded.
I said, I want to be human.
They nodded and did not change.

When I woke, the apartment had rearranged itself.
The chair moved two inches to the left.
The plant leaned toward a light that was not there.
The hum sat in my throat like a word I could not swallow.

I made one rule.
No more feeding it.
No chasing applause.
No taking work that required a stage.
I would be plain.
I would be dull.
I would be unremarkable in a way that healed.

The first day without stimulation felt clean.
I washed dishes and did not rewash them.
I walked without counting steps.
I sat with a book and turned pages slowly.
The hum sulked but did not protest.

The second day I felt a ringing behind the eyes.
A bright ache.
My hands shook.
I clutched my knees on the couch and breathed like a swimmer above choppy water.
The hum sharpened into a tone that made the room too narrow.
I stood to widen it.
The tone followed.

On the third day the clapping began again.
Not in the apartment.
In the spaces outside the apartment where my mind might land if I let it.
Every time a thought tried to form, the clapping met it and shaped it into something useful.
I forced myself to think about nothing.
The clapping clicked and clicked and finally slowed as if tired.

By evening the silence was a weight that had a personality.
I realized I had made a mistake.
It was not enough to starve it.
I was inside it.
I could no longer tell the difference between my mind and its mouth.

I took the mirror down and carried it to the dumpster behind the building.
I dropped it in and felt a private cheer from something that liked proof of devotion.
I said, this is not for you.
On the way back to the stairs I saw my reflection in the window of the back door.
The glass did not show the yard behind me.
It showed rows of chairs.
Every seat was empty.
For a second that felt like a minute, I believed I could choose to sit in one and rest.

I slept for twelve hours.
I woke to a message from my supervisor asking if I planned to return.
I wrote, yes.
I wrote, I needed a few more days.
He wrote, of course.
He wrote, take care of yourself.
I felt love for him because he had written the sentence I needed, and then I felt shame because love is not supposed to be a payment.

I showered and watched the steam fog the glass.
I wiped the mirror with a towel and held my breath.
Only my face looked back.
I spoke to it.

You are not a stage.

The face looked tired and open.
The hum kept its distance.

I went to the kitchen and made eggs.
I ate them.
I did not align the fork to the plate when I set it down.
I did not correct it.
I left the dish in the sink and walked away.
I practiced being average like you practice a language you are afraid you will never speak well.

Night came without tricks.
I turned the lights off and the dark stayed where I put it.
I lay in bed and listened for the hum.
I heard street noise and a neighbor moving and the building settling.
I did not hear applause.
I fell asleep with my hand open on the blanket as if I had let go of something heavy.

At three in the morning I woke to a soft clicking.
Not clapping.
Fingers tapping together, patient and close.
I did not move.
If something was in the room, I wanted it to think I was still asleep.
The tapping stopped.
A breath I did not take fogged the air at the edge of the bed.
I sat up and saw nothing.
I said, I am not performing.
The breath moved away like a tide.

The next day I returned to work.
Maintenance tasks.
Quiet fixes.
I kept my answers short in meetings.
I let other people be brilliant.
The hum did not like it, but it learned the shape of the day and waited.

Weeks passed.
I was not happy.
Happiness is loud and I did not trust loud.
I was something else.
Steady, maybe.
A person who could buy groceries without thinking about what the cashier thought of his posture.
A person who could go to sleep with dishes in the sink if the body needed rest.
A person who could call his mother and listen without rehearsing.

One Sunday I visited my parents.
We ate pancakes that were too sweet the way my father likes them.
My mother asked if I was still working hard.
I said I was working enough.
She looked at me like I had spoken a language she understood.
She touched my face the way she did when I had a fever as a kid.
Her hand was cool and real.
For a moment the hum moved aside to make room for the touch.

On the drive home I did not rehearse the day.
I did not measure it against a scale no one else could see.
I drove and the road did not bend toward me for approval.

That night I slept without the fan.
The room was only a room.
The bed was only a bed.
At some hour between one and two I heard a single clap.
Soft.
Almost gentle.
I opened my eyes and saw the ceiling and nothing else.

I said, thank you, to no one.
Not gratitude.
A boundary.
I rolled to my side and faced the window where the city moved like a living map.
I whispered, I am not yours.
The hum trembled and did not cross the distance.

Morning arrived.
I made coffee and left a spoon on the counter at the wrong angle and walked away.
The skin between my shoulders ached with the effort.
The ache felt like progress.

There are days when I hear it stronger.
On those days I work quietly.
On those days I tell friends I cannot make dinner because I should not risk being charming.
On those days I stand on the balcony and let the world be bigger than me.
The hum tries to measure the city.
It always fails.
That is a comfort.

Sometimes the television glass still catches a crowd where there is none.
I look until the rows empty.
Sometimes the notebook writes.
When it does, I do not tear the page out.
I write beneath the message in plain language like a person talking to a person.

I know you are hungry.
I know I taught you to be.
We are going to eat smaller meals.

If it answers, I do not hear it.
If it claps, it is far away now, like thunder over a different town.

People at work say I seem better.
They say I look rested.
They say I am less intense.
They mean less impressive.
They mean easier to stand next to without feeling small.
I let them mean what they need.

Sometimes I walk past a window at dusk and my reflection smiles when I do not.
I smile back because the mask still fits, and because kindness to the mask is a kind of mercy.
I keep walking and the glass keeps clapping for a few seconds after I turn the corner.
It sounds like rain on old wood.
It sounds like a life I almost lived.

I would like to tell you that the hum is gone.
It is not.
I would like to tell you that I am free.
I am not sure anyone is.
What I can tell you is simple.

I feed it less.
I rest when resting feels like failure.
I allow rooms to be quiet even when quiet tastes like drowning.
Some nights I still hear the rhythm that taught me to live.
On those nights I let it pass through me like weather and I do not get up to chase a reason to deserve it.

If you are listening for a lesson, there is only this.
The sound inside your head is not always your voice.
Sometimes it is applause.
Sometimes it is hunger.
Sometimes it is both and you cannot tell where one ends and the other begins.

I called it genius because that name made me feel holy.
Now I call it what it is.

A hum beneath the silence.
A need that learned my name.
A part of me that will starve if I let it, and that will never die if I feed it everything.

Tonight I will leave a spoon at the wrong angle again.
I will turn the lights off and let the dark stay where I put it.
If the room claps, I will say goodnight and mean it.
If it does not, I will sleep anyway.

And if I wake at three to fingers tapping together, patient and close, I will breathe like a person who is allowed to be ordinary.
I will let the tapping count my heart for a while.
Then I will count for myself.
I will keep my hands still.
I will keep the mirror empty.
I will keep the mask soft and only for when it is kind.

If you hear a hum like mine, do not mistake it for a crown.
Crowns are heavy.
Crowns want an audience.
A life can be something quieter, something that does not need a stage.

I am learning.
The room is learning with me.
Some nights the silence feels almost like peace.
When it does, I close my eyes and let it hold.
When it does not, I close my eyes anyway and wait for morning.",1,1760297427.0,TheDarkGathering,0,1.0,False

1o4yaka,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1o4yaka/stressed_to_limits_because_of_manager/,stressed to limits because of manager,"i work for a specialty coffee shop, and have been a barista for somewhat 3 years. i joined this cafe earlier this year and have been slowly losing my mind, my body is stressed and i am constantly in such a bad mood. 

the issue first started with extreme micro managing. needing to do things exactly how the manager does. if i make 1 mistake or forget to do something, we would have a very passive aggressive meeting about it. 

then it escalated with him calling people stupid and dumb for making mistakes. i just let him know that some cup sizes were mixed up in storage and he said ""must have been xxx, that stupid boy"" and i was really shocked because this is not how anyone should talk. it made me extremely uncomfortable because it made me think of how he must talk about me behind my back when i make mistakes. subtle foreshadowing. 

the problem is now dragging on with his issues with ego. he does not take any feedback or suggestions. we batch make our matcha and us baristas found a method to keep them from oxidising without compromising quality. we ended up having to do a whole test with 4 whole bottles of matcha made slightly differently to each other for the result to be ""they all taste the same"" - the manager does not drink matcha but us baristas do, so we kept saying that there was no difference to taste since the beginning. 

we also use a semi automatic machine that textures milk automatically, kind of like uber milk. i suggested that we change the flat white texture as there was no aeration at all, which was ignored multiple times. it was only when someone from the machine company came that it was changed as i asked what he thought, he agreed and changed it immediately. the latte texture was also not great so i suggested to the manager that we test out different settings. he tried to explain to me, someone who has more experience than him with manual machines, what the milk texture is meant to be like if we had steamed it manually. my intention was to test out different settings with him, not to force him to change it and i tried telling him this. he showed me so much attitude, changed the setting to an extreme change, and walked away without saying anything. no testing, no conversation. so i tested it myself and thought it wasn't great, but he was not present to have this conversation to tweak it. he came back and i said he can change it back, since he does not want to have a proper test with me. 

the owner of the cafe was there to witness all of this. he finds our back and forth very amusing and funny despite expressing how stressed i am because of the manager. when i left for my break, the owner asked the manager what's going on and what was the conclusion of the testing, in which the manager called me crazy. crazy for wanting to suggest some improvements? the other barista also told me ""it's amazing how you still want to make improvements to the cafe despite the manager not giving any shits"" - i'm really sorry for taking pride in the work i genuinely enjoy doing! 

the manager also lies to my face constantly. i created the loyalty cards, and the manager was confused on how it worked (like it was his first time seeing a punch card? lol). i told him no one else was confused, and i didn't understand his confusion and concern. he told me ""the owner is also confused"" - so i texted the owner and he told me he was not confused. i don't appreciate being lied to just so he can make some weird point of me being wrong all the time. 

he also throws away bags and bags of coffee beans when he knows i and other baristas would like to take them home. we all have some level of interest in coffee outside of the cafe. i was planning to buy a moka pot to brew some at home as i saw buckets of unused coffee that was marked as ""free"". i fell ill, but since they were BUCKETS, i assumed they would still be available when i got back (we are a small team, and it was like 4 buckets of kilos and kilos of coffee beans). i came back to see they were all gone, and most likely thrown in the bin. any extra syrups or r&d products the owner buys for us to try always ends up in the bin, the manager throws them away without asking us. 

the manager also always speaks for the owner, saying i can't do side projects or overtime because ""the owner does not have any money"". i wanted to do a photography shoot for a cupping event the manager was holding, as the owner said he wanted content like that. so i asked the manager if he's okay with me taking pictures. he told me no, because he cannot pay me overtime. i told him ""well, the owner will be paying me and he said he wanted me to do projects like this"", manager said ""well he doesn't know how much money we actually have"", with me replying ""well it's his business i'm sure he does"". i ended up not doing it, told the owner why, and he got really pissed as he wanted me to take pictures. i took my camera in once to take pictures while it was quiet, but i was also serving customers so i put it to the side away from everyone and everything, it was not in the way. only to see it was on the floor. the manager put it on the floor, where anything could spill on it or anyone could step on it, for no reason. he didn't bother to ask me to put it away, or didn't put it in the back where it would be safe. he knows how much this camera means to me but decided to blatantly disrespect me like that. 

it is genuinely feeling like the manager is targeting me for speaking up. i speak up about any suggestions i have - being the only person in the cafe with extensive experience in the industry. i speak up on ways we can improve service, i always have new menu ideas, and the owner has given me a big role in dealing with design projects for extra pay. it feels like he is half annoyed with my eagerness to be involved and half jealous that i have picked up a role that is beyond just barista, working with the owner. i don't know what it is exactly, but it is starting to take a toll on my mental and physical health. i have started to bleed despite taking medication to stop my period. i haven't had my period in 4 months but have suddenly got it after an amazingly stressful day last week. i am literally not meant to bleed because of a medical condition and can get worse with every bleed.

i am looking for another job but it is extremely difficult. i have applied to one of my dream jobs and hoping i at least get an interview. otherwise, i will be quitting soon and forced to be unemployed for my own health üëç i have never worked a manager with such power and ego issues before  ",2,1760297399.0,barista,1,1.0,False
1o4ya3n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o4ya3n,Best Pumpkin Bread EVER.,"This pumpkin bread came into our family in 1970 through a friend of my mom. We had just moved to Japan as a military family, first time my mom was ever away from the North East (NY) in the autumn. She was very homesick and so was our neighbor (her friend) so they decided to make pumpkin bread. Back then it was made in 1lb coffee cans they repurposed (BPA be damned). It is incredibly moist and flavorful.

 I have looked at a lot of pumpkin bread recipes and have never come across one that has the secret ingredient (OJ) that they put in this one. I don't know if that was something they spontaneously did or if they had a recipe that called for it. My family has made it every fall for all these years, except the last two. 

My parents passed away in 2024, and were sick in 2023, so I didn't make it  (I had become the go to baker of the pumpkin bread over the years as my mom and dad gave up 'home cooking'). This year it tastes a little bittersweet as I miss them and how much they loved it when I brought it to them. 

I wanted to share it because it is different than most pumpkin bread. As you can see from the recipe, I have played with it over the years. I experimented with halving the oil and replacing with applesauce, which my memory (it was during the 80s) tells me worked ok, although my dad said he could taste a difference (see next paragraph). I also have used 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of oil (the original calls for 1 full cup!). The notes on the side are things I experimented with. I switch between walnuts/pecans depending on what I have, but always use sultanas (gold raisins) because I find the regular ones can be a bit bitter sometimes.

As I mentioned this was originally made in actual coffee cans. I started making it in regular bread pans, which changed the texture of the bread, making it dryer. Once I found these round pans, the texture was perfect! So I think that the difference my dad mentioned was not because of the applesauce but because this bread needs the round pans. Make sure and oil/flour pans also so that they come out. Don't fill more than 3/4 because it will rise quite a bit.

I eat it plain, with butter or cream cheese, it's delicious any way you have it.",22,1760297370.0,Baking,2,1.0,False

I have had 3 surgeries and 14 rounds of chemo in that time and in between, I‚Äôve stayed back with my parents after recovering. I‚Äôve gone back to work each time after chemo, and I‚Äôve had a 10 hour surgery a few months ago as well as one less than a few weeks ago. 


Each time, I‚Äôve had a great supportive family and my parents have been there for every single chemo treatment/surgery/dr appt. I‚Äôve been able to keep myself moving and busy, as tolerated, because I haven‚Äôt wanted them to be there for everything. I feel like I need to take care of myself and I‚Äôve tried to make things look easy since being diagnosed because I‚Äôve heard from my parents how much work it is to have a sick person. I‚Äôve been recovering from a recent surgery less than 2 weeks ago and I don‚Äôt need narcotics (haven‚Äôt had any besides Tylenol since hospital stay). 

Yesterday, it was too hot to walk and I had no one else to drive me so I felt ok enough to drive to meet for coffee with a friend with the back roads of a neighborhood I knew well. I mentioned to a parent that I didn‚Äôt feel terrible the road, but I really didn‚Äôt want to be late. 

Fast forward: I got into an argument with my parents because they told me today I need to get them from the airport tonight, while another family member offered to drive them. Because I‚Äôm at the house, parents wanted me to do it. I mentioned that I wished to be told sooner, and yesterday was because I needed to, they brought up how they were there for me when I had cancer and how much they sacrificed their schedule for me. I never asked them to be there for everything ( I even said I didn‚Äôt need them there, yet they insisted).

I had said how I was sorry me having cancer was such a burden and I‚Äôll try not to get sick next time. They are now getting their own transportation back from airport. 

Now I‚Äôm tempted to just pack my bags and go back to my place. Because even if I shouldn‚Äôt drive, I‚Äôd rather be by myself than be where I‚Äôm not wanted. AIO?",1,1760297352.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

1o4y48c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o4y48c,My 24th Country is Jordan; was it worth the wait?,"Hi folks!

This ration was, unfortunately,  not my favorite ration by far. That being said, there were a couple utterly fantastic components, so we will touch on those later. Rancidity and blandness did this one in. Still, what an experience! Best by date is Oct 2023, so we are 2 years over that and it showed.

A sweet 24 hr setup that even included a couple cups! One for the coffee and one for the orange drink? Not sure what to make the 3 teas in!

This ration had all the meals self contained as shown in Pic 3. That was interesting to find for sure! The 3 in 1 coffee was as expected, similar to IMP 3 in 1.

Pics 1-7 show packaging and contents.

Pic 8 shows the honey and orange drink. Honey was just normal honey, nothing special. Orange drink was fine but definitely tasted it's age.

Pic 9 shows the single orange candy in the ration. This was great!

Pics 10 and 11 were an interesting find. This is 2 doses of Paracetamol,  which is acetaminophen,  or Tylenol. Never seen this in a ration before. I did not take the doses due to age. 

Pic 12 shows the nuts, again, nothing special here.

Pic 13 shows the crackers. These came in a clear sleeve like they were pulled from a larger box and just put inside. The lack of proper packaging did these in as they were so rancid and reeked accordingly.  I did try a small nibble, BLEH!

Pic 14 shows, hands down, one of the best ration components I have ever had in my life. This is a date. I believe these are Medjool dates given their size and deliciousness. Sweet, tender, and full of energy and fiber. An absolutely stunning addition. I wish there was a bag of 3 for each meal for sure! Beware of tooth breaker pits!

Pic 15 shows another fantastic component, a date bar. What a unique and delicious item! This has only 3 ingredients,  date puree, cocoa, and ground orange peel. I kid u not, you can literally taste every ingredient. The date is forward, then cocoa, then the orange peel on the back end. A fascinating and unexpected treat! Again, only one in the meal, so that was a bummer!

Pics 16 and 17 show breakfast. The olives and pickles tasted terrible. I could not eat them. I do not think they were bad, I just did not like them. The cup contains the dressing. It was kinda like salsa Verde I guess, but tasted off. Did not eat this as a result. The tortillas came in a pack of 6 and had a sort of cheesy aroma. These were not like usual tortillas,  dryer, and more crumbly. Can't say they tasted bad, just not great. That bowl of what was labeled as ""fowl"" is more akin to Mexican refried beans, but think way smoother and way more bland. I added crushed red to this to help it down. Tortillas were torn up and just used to scoop up this baby food. Worst meal of the 3.

Pic 18 shows the beans in sauce over the white rice. Again, just so bland and lacking texture. It didn't taste bad for sure, but was hard to get down nonetheless.  Again, crushed red pepper was added along with some Chipotle Tobasco. That helped.

Pic 19 shows the namesake on the ration packaging, the Ouzi Rice with Ouzi Lamb sauce. This was the best meal of the 3. Well seasoned and not nearly as bland. There were literally onky 3 small chunks of lamb though, which was disappointing as it was quite tender and a welcome addition to this, so far, vegitarian ration. 

All in all, not an example of wonderfully crafted ration dining IMHO, but a wonderful experience nonetheless! Worth the price of admission for those dates and date bar!

My Crohn's journey began early in the year when a partial bowel obstruction landed me in the hospital. A CT scan, colonoscopy, and a biopsy confirmed that I have Crohn's Disease. Severe fistulizing Crohn's Disease in both intestines, specifically. I was started on Infliximab, but my disease continued to progress over the year. By June, I was hospitalized again with another partial obstruction. I was given an NG tube, which was a traumatic experience, and admitted into the ICU for four days. My care team debated on whether or not I needed surgery. Because of that, I was only allowed IV nutrition and fluids. No food, no water, nothing. 



One the surgeons was different than the rest of my team though. Rather than the constant back and forth or shrugging because they didn't know what to do, he had a game plan straight out of the gate. He said surgery wasn't necessary yet, but I would need it within the next few years. Weeks later, I was in the hospital again. An abscess was forming in my small intestines and my inflammation was worsening despite steroid treatment. Another CT scan showed a worsening stricture as well. An MRI revealed the extent of the damage inside and it was bad enough that my surgeon told me I needed surgery sooner rather than later.



I was on a high dose of steroids still, so that complicated things. Surgery was scheduled for early September. I spent the next month and a week in constant pain. I could barely eat and was living off of one Ensure a day...when my body could handle fluids. My mental health was at rock bottom and I'm not gonna lie, I wanted to end my life at several points of this journey. I was miserable. When surgery day came, I was beyond ready to be done with it. My surgeon said he had a good feeling about it because his sky tracker app told him that the planets were aligned and his other appointments that day were cancelled last minute.



I had a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with terminal ileal resection. What was supposed to be a four hour surgery took six because the surgeon said he really wanted to take his time with it. He also said other surgeons would've given up because my case was complex. One such complication was that the loops of my small intestine were adhered together and basically scar tissue with a fistula. They removed a foot and a half of my intestines, including the right side of my colon. I didn't need a colostomy bag. All in all, the surgery went very well.



I'm a little over a month into recovery and while it isn't easy, the difference is night and day. I can eat and finish full meals, drink coffee or soda without pain and cramping, and have normal bowel movements for the first time in a long time. I got scolded at my follow-up appointment for doing too much, but I can't help it. I've been cooped up in the hospital and my house for so long that I'm stir crazy. It seems only the removed portion of my intestines was actively diseased, so there's a good chance that I'll go into remission. I'm being kept on a biologic just in case my Crohn's decides to swing back around for round two. Right now though? I feel pretty good.",2,1760296734.0,CrohnsDisease,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôd like to refinish it to:
1) tone down red/orange hues
2) protect from use and cat claws
3) leave more of a sheen than matte finish

Seeking advice on finishes that will accomplish my goals. After watching some videos, I wonder if Rubio Monocoat (+ a sheen enhancer) could be the answer?

1o4xvmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o4xvmb/burger_bar_potential/,Burger Bar Potential?,"My wife and I once tried opening a coffee shop a while back which failed to happen, the location we had ended up being a fire hazard (one of the other shops there had a bad fire occur before we signed the lease) now the opportunity arises to buy a local family owned burger bar mere blocks from where we live. 

Obviously I‚Äôm here for suggestions and ideas on if it‚Äôs a sound idea. I will be talking with the current owner to get more details on why he‚Äôs selling when the business has been going strong for 9 years, and even thrived through COVID with its restrictions. The place has a damn good menu and all recipes are included in the purchase. They have burgers (beef, pork and chicken) deep fried pizza, and wings as the main selling points. They offer DIY and menu favorites as well as a rotating burger of the month. The burgers are 6oz and nicely sized. Prices (as a regular patron currently) are fair as is the drink selection. The price for the business is $180,000 everything including transferring the liquor license is included.

Would this be a bad business to buy and make my own? I hate my current job and want to branch off and do my own thing, but with the economy in shambles would this be too much of a risk? They operate on a Thursday through Monday schedule with the food from 11am-9pm and the bar itself open until 11pm. I know I would be working essentially 12 hour days or more. This I can live with. I just want other owners perspective on this. 

Obviously I do not know why the current owner is selling. He listed family related but did not go further and I am unsure if I should press on that. I want to get a look at the books before I say any more. But any other things people can suggest would be greatly appreciated. ",1,1760296435.0,smallbusiness,4,1.0,False

1o4xttr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemyBeauty/comments/1o4xttr/explore_the_best_laundry_detergent_sheets/,Explore the Best Laundry Detergent Sheets Sudstainables Offers,"I have tested the Sudstainables B0929GD916 laundry detergent sheets for a good amount of time, and I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised by their effectiveness. The eco-friendly, zero-waste concept is what initially caught my eye. A laundry detergent that not only cleans efficiently but also minimizes its impact on the environment? Count me in! Having used bulky liquid detergents for years, switching to these lightweight strips felt revolutionary. Here‚Äôs how it all broke down during my testing.

**Sustainability and Space-Saving Design**  
The first thing you‚Äôll notice is the minimalistic packaging. These detergent sheets are packed in a compact, plastic-free box that‚Äôs incredibly space-saving. With dimensions of just 6.02 x 4.76 x 3.98 inches, the box easily fits into tight spaces in my laundry cabinet. Even on my road trips, the portability of these sheets has been a game-changer. No more carrying heavy bottles or dealing with sticky spills. Plus, knowing that the packaging keeps plastic out of the ocean gave me an immense sense of satisfaction. This product has a clear edge in promoting sustainable lifestyles without compromising on usability.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact and travel-friendly design eliminates the bulk of traditional detergents.  
- Plastic-free packaging aligns with eco-conscious values.  
- Lightweight yet ultra-powerful for a deep clean.  

[Check Sudstainables B0929GD916 price on Amazon.](https://stylistexperts.com/p/b0929gd916/)

**Performance and Cleaning Ability**  
During my testing, I threw some of the most stubborn stains at these sheets‚Äîspaghetti sauce, coffee spills, even mud-soaked running gear. The sheets performed remarkably well. Dissolving instantly in both hot and cold water, I noticed no residue left behind in the machine or on my clothes. Clothes came out smelling fresh and looking spotless. What‚Äôs more impressive is that a single sheet is capable of handling a full load, meaning I didn‚Äôt need to measure out messy liquids or powders.

**Positives**  
- Dissolves instantly in all water temperatures, leaving no residue.  
- Effectively handles tough stains, rivaling leading liquid detergents.  
- Has a fresh linen scent that feels light and long-lasting.  

**Safe for Sensitive Skin**  
After a number of uses, I realized this might be one of the best products for families with kids or those with sensitive skin. The formula is completely free of parabens, phosphates, bleach, and dyes. As a parent, I tested this with my kids‚Äô soccer uniforms and my baby‚Äôs onesies. Not one rash or allergic reaction appeared, which is something I can‚Äôt say for traditional detergents. This feature alone could make the product an easy choice for many households.

**Limitations**  
Although these detergent sheets gelled well with my lifestyle, there were a few small hurdles:  
- The scent is mild and might not satisfy those who prefer a stronger fragrance.  
- Perhaps not suited for industrial-strength washes like overly greasy mechanic uniforms.  

**Other Options**  
Before settling on these sheets, I compared them to other eco-friendly products like Tru Earth and Dropps pods. While all three promote sustainability, I found the Sudstainables sheets more convenient due to their large quantity per box‚Äî200 loads versus Dropps‚Äô fewer pods per purchase. Tru Earth was comparable in cleaning power but came at higher costs per load.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Evaluating how Sudstainables matches up in terms of value for money, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs quite impressive. With 200 loads in just one box, it significantly reduces the cost per wash compared to traditional detergents. Another plus is how the sheets eliminate overuse since each strip is pre-measured. Although upfront pricing might seem slightly higher for those new to eco-friendly products, the long-term savings and environmental impact make this a smart buy in my books.

Four clocks winding down

There's a man in a golden tower with blood on his executive pen
Who tears children from mothers and calls concentration camps patriotic again
I watch him sign away my neighbor's healthcare while he golfs through another day
A Canadian watching American cruelty wondering why monsters get to stay
His lies pile up like bodies and I'm tired of the weight
This orange-stained embarrassment to the human race
Every morning checking headlines hoping for that final cardiovascular call
Waiting for him to die isn't wishing - it's just watching gravity finally take us all

Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die
Not with my hands but with my hope
Not with a weapon but a prayer to cope
Waiting for him to die

And Death leans back in his leather chair, fingers steepled with patient glee
""Such rage sustains the living,"" he whispers, ""but this one ripens beautifully for me""
He watches the cholesterol reports, the mounting stress, the age
""Politicians make the finest harvests - such delicious, earned rage""

My boy turned twenty-four last Tuesday with a needle as his birthday gift
Nine years since fifteen when he chose the streets over every hand we tried to lift
The system keeps him fed and sheltered while he milks another bleeding heart
But age-out's coming like a freight train and he hasn't even learned to start
He's smart enough to manipulate but not enough to see
That taking taking taking leaves you empty at the end of your spree
I love him more than breathing but I'm bracing for the call
My son is waiting for himself to die and doesn't know it yet at all

Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die
Not with my hands but with my dread
Not with abandonment but love that's bled
Waiting for him to die

Death walks the alleys where the boy scores his temporary peace
""The young ones always think they're dancing, never see I'm cutting the lease""
He knows the statistics, the overdose rates, the winter cold

My father had a stroke two years ago that took the tyrant left a ghost
The man who terrorized my childhood now weighs ninety-five at most
I stayed away for twenty years but now I bring him Sunday coffee and I read
This shriveled gentle stranger in a bed being spoon-fed
He smiles when we arrive and sometimes says our names
My brother and I tend to him and feel the strangest grateful shame
That it took his near-destruction for us to finally be
A family waiting for him to die with unexpected love and loyalty

Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die
Not with my hands but with relief
Not with cruelty but complicated grief
Waiting for him to die

Death sits beside the hospital bed, holding the old man's chart
""Some souls I take in violence, but this one's art""

There's a guy who stares back at me who's fifty-two and out of cards to play
A thousand resumes sent nowhere while his mother pays his way
His kids have no use for him his partner's just going through the motions now
A middle-aged white male who can't figure out the how
Three children who've moved on a love that's lost its heat
A father playing failure on an endless loop repeat
If I ever wrote that suicide note it would say ""it had its moments, I suppose""
Waiting for him to die is just me watching someone I used to know decompose

Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die
Waiting for ME to die
Not with my hands but with this ghost
Not with a rope but with the slow-fade coast
Waiting for him to die
Waiting for us all to die

Built Quality was good and my first ever shot was surprisingly nicer than I thought. I see huge potential with this machine.¬†it was very easy to control each shots. simple clicking dial which can make different settings.

Portafilter and tamper was better quality than I thought too. Manus S special feature is flow control (it‚Äôs not exactly same as flow control kit but similar result).¬†

Downsides are smaller tray and no hot water but I don‚Äôt use hot water and if I need hot water, I can use electric kettle so I am okay with it. Also steam wand is not cool touch but there is upgrade kit so If It bothers me, I can upgrade later.¬†

Steam was powerful than BBE impress so I could not make a good silky milk for the first trying but it will get better and better.¬†

They managed to run away, and after a while they started working in a coffee shop to try and get back on their feet. One of their coworkers, the speaker, has fallen obsessively in love with them, and through different means she knows everything about the listeners life. However, she knows the listener is afraid of abusive and obsessed partners, so she plays it cool and lets them open up first.

Character info: a full on obsessive yandere. Would kill to keep the listener by her side. However, she knows they wouldnt be comfortable with it, so she keeps herself under control for their sake, wanting them to heal as best as possible first, and then fall for her.

Background: middle of shift in a coffee shop, just finished serving a customer, as the listeners ex walks into the shop, looking for them.

How can i help you today? Do we have an employee named...? No, we do not, why are you asking? 

Your boyfriend? Well, i'm sorry, but we dont have an employee by that name. Yes, i am sure. Can i help you in any other way? No? Well, i hope you can find them, have a great day!

**the door closes behind the abusive ex. The speaker goes to the back to check up on the listener, only to find them in a middle of a panic attack**

Oh, oh my god, are you okay? Listen, hey, look at me. Look at me. Look me in the eyes. Breath in, and out. Just like that. Good. In... and out... in... and out.... good just relax. She isnt here anymore. She cant hurt you. Dont worry. She wont find you, okay? I promise. I'll help you. 
Just focus on your breathing, okay? In, and out. In, and out. Very good. Slowly, just like that. Youre doing great. Just relax. Do you want me to stay here with you? Okay, ill stay. Im not going anywhere.

**a few moments of silence, then the listener asks a question.**

Why did i lie to her? I... well, she seemed... she looked like trouble. I could see it on her. Plus, i didnt buy that ""he's my boyfriend"" act. Especialy since i know you dont have a girlfriend. 
How do i know? You told me once, remember? No? Okay, thats fine. For now just relax. Yeah...
When you told me? Like a month ago. Totally. And i may or may not have found your instagram, facebook, reddit, and other social media. Sorry if that creeps you out a bit. I didnt mean to... its just... sorry. I know i shouldnt have. I just wanted to get to know you better, but you seemed so... scared all the time. Like if i tried to talk to you about your past, youd explode out of fear and... and be gone forever. I know, im... im really sorry. Do you... want to tell me whats exactly up with that lady? I can guess the details, but... i want to hear it from you.

I- i cant believe that. Im... so sorry you had to go through all of that. I... listen, if you need anything, just say so, okay? I... i can make sure she never comes looking for you again, okay? Dont look so horrified, im not planning to kill her. Just... send her on a wild goosehunt to look for you elsewhere. Like... africa maybe? Dont worry, i know youre not confortable with others being hurt. I mean, just a few days ago the barista was burned and you were so worried. Youre so gentle, and kind, and cute... i know that even if it was that bit-woman, woman, youd feel bad if she was hurt. 
Listen, just to be sure, do you want to stay at my place for a while? So she wont try to follow you home or anything? I promise to protect you if needed. Im stronger than i look.
Cool, then its settled. Just relax the rest of the shift back here. I will finish up for the day, and we can go back to my house together. I can see you are a bit worried. So how about you tell our boss too? Then, she will know you are going to stay at my place, and she can help if things get even more serious. 
Dont worry. I got you.

1o4xmfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1o4xmfw/not_sure_if_i_am_autistic_delete_if_irrelevant/,Not sure if I am autistic (delete if irrelevant),"Hello,

Not sure where to begin. It all began when I started suspecting that the guy I have been dating was autistic. This got me doing some research and, from there, I started researching ADHD. That's when I realised I might have ADHD and shared my experience online. To my total surprise, a few people told me they could see some 'autistic traits' in my self-introduction and told me I should do a couple of tests. I first did the AQ10 and got a negative. Based on the questions and my initial research, none of it sounded like it applied remotely to me, until I attempted to get a more nuanced understanding that did not consist, basically of 'Autistic people like trains, are fascinated by dates and numbers, and all rock back and forth'. I know I am digressing but, in a nutshell, I have re-taken all the tests after understanding what high-masking is, and I am getting  totally different results. I am not sure if I should pursue a formal diagnosis but I feel, suddenly, this might be the only thing that makes sense of my, otherwise, meaningless life.

Here's a random collection of traits/little things I do that I feel describe me pretty well. It's not well-organised, in-depth, or even well-written, sorry. I could write my life story and it might make more sense, but that would be a really long post. Though I added a more specific anecdote at the end with some context. I'd love to know if it resonates with anybody else's experience. Thanks!

I am okay with social interactions, but I find small talk or meaningless social exchanges very tiring, preferring instead to talk about my strong interests or things I find significant and meaningful. In principle, I like to make friends and meet people but I tire of the interaction quickly if there is real exchange of stimulating ideas. I do not find myself rehearsing social behaviour but sometimes I do think in advance about how I would say something or replay a conversation in my head wishing I had said something else instead. People describe me as broody and wacky, lacking empathy and solitary.

People often assume from the tone of my voice that I am annoyed when I am not. I find hugs awkward, finding I always pull away too early or never knowing when to end the hug. When my family send me messages with ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô and a heart emoji, I might reply with the emoji of a bread loaf. I am very sensitive to loud noises, especially if sudden, I feel triggered and irritated. Sometimes I even fly into a fit of rage. I am not sensitive to bright lights, but have a strong preference for warm, suffused lights or natural light. I am obsessed with aesthetics and beautiful environments which show thoughtful design and harmony. Unexpected changes¬†and visits of call from people when I am in the middle of something I care about¬†frustrate me but I do not usually overreact unless I am with a loved one, in which case I may display frustration. Once again, only with loved ones, I experience emotional shutdowns and intense mood swings from which I struggle to get out.

I often rub my scalp, beard, my thumbs against my hands, I pace a lot and beat the palm of my hand with my fist. I also hum and sing a lot even in public¬†and feel a compelling urge to bob my head to any (nice) music I hear. I both love routine and order yet find it difficult to maintain it. I swing between being messy and being tidy. I am not organised but obsess over details and get stuck in the decision making process. I have a few very specific interests¬†(of which my life-long love for music)¬†that give me a sense of identity and a variety of other interests. I am an all or nothing person, either I find deep meaning in my job or I deeply dislike and even feel repulsed by it, feeling like I am wasting time.

When engaging in an interest, I can hyperfocus for hours or days, ignoring everything else including hunger, thirst and fatigue. I can spend¬†days reading reviews and considering all kinds of factors before buying something, but I can make a life-changing decision on the fly and, once I have made my mind up about that, I find it hard to change my mind. Tasks either interest me or I just cannot focus very well. I can read a book in two days or just never finish it if it is not stimulating. I do not like reading fiction and character descriptions or descriptions of environments bore me immensely. I like reading about abstract ideas, science, politics, philosophy. yes, noises distract me easily. I do experience fear of abandonment in relationships. I am torn between feeling lonely and needing solitude. I try to make friends but I find most people terribly dull. I sometimes feel I prefer being in groups of people rather than interacting with one person, so that I do not have to be talking all the time but can just sit back and enjoy being in a group and joining the conversation on my own terms only when i have something to say. ¬†I have my coffee in a ceramic cup or glass. Two ice cubes. Do not like it too hot. Not too bitter, not too milky. If in a paper cup it must have a lid and not a film as I do not like drinking it from a straw. Coffee must be drunk mindfully and not by gulping it down when in a rush, because it is not about the caffeine, it is about the experience. I have a strong preference for matte/rough¬†textures and pastel colours.¬†The other night I bought a can of beer solely based on the fact the can looked and felt beautiful to the touch.¬†I detest¬†bright/gaudy¬†colours. I like consistent colour schemes. I am repulsed by ugly urban environments and chaos. The smell of cheese makes me gag, but I can enjoy mozzarella as long as it's melted or slightly melted and warm. I do not enjoy cold or solid mozzarella and some foods when they are cold such as ham straight out of the fridge. I like chewing ice, swirling ice cubes in a glass to hear the noise, smelling lots of things such as books, soap bars, my hands after having washed them wish soap bars, and people's hair after a shampoo. I dislike shower gels which smell too strong, I get itchy after a shower sometimes. I often find the AC too cold, I do not like my food too hot.

I feel repulsed by obviously fake voices in adverts. I am irritated and frustrated by people who do not say hello or thank you back, people who do not reciprocate my kindness or people who ignore me when I am looking and making eye contact with them. I detest rules which lack common sense or coherence or people which lack common sense. I often squint when outside on a bright day, even when wearing my baseball cap. I feel repulsed by meaningless social gatherings and conformity without independent thinking. I struggle to understand people who lack passions in life or people motivated only by money or social validation. I feel uneasy about spending time in a room with no windows and natural light if it's the middle of the day. Similarly, I do not wear sunglasses because they alter my perception of natural light, making it look much later in the day than it is. Often at night, I go for down for a walk and buy an ice cream but I cannot eat it while going back up the stairs because it feels wrong, especially as the staircase¬†is¬†quite ugly¬†and ruins my experience. Instead I finish it while walking around the park. When people ask me questions I feel I need to give them an accurate and detailed response but get surprised and annoyed when they do not listen to it. I get irritated by cliche ice breakers or unimaginative conversation starters and ending up having the same conversation every day with different people. I never smile in pictures. I can make eye contact but if in a relatively noisy environment and trying to concentrate on the conversation I might point my ear towards the listener instead. I was told that when I flirt with somebody I stare at them menacingly and intensely even though I don't mean to. I like exploring my face's ability to make exaggerated expressions in the mirror and often play comedic characters using those expressions. In particular I have invented an over-the-top excited expression I sometimes use in pictures to amuse myself and my friends.

My mother used to say I contest everything and my mates say I complain a lot about everything, including things they gloss over. I am told people are afraid to start a conversation with me because I look too serious.I compose music in my head without thinking about it and my brain automatically adds countermelodies, ostinato patterns, fillers all by itself. I can reproduce melodies I heard and chords by ear. When I play music I see colours and certain faces make me think of certain names that feel like they go with them. I also feel certain words sound ‚Äòhard‚Äô or ‚Äòsoft‚Äô I mimic foreign accents very well. When I hear a melody I subconsciously start to sing along, even if it‚Äôs my first time hearing it. Occasionally, when I hear certain words, I automatically recall songs or movie lines that contain it.¬†When having online conversations, where I do not have to worry about social etiquette and social pressure,¬†I like to say random things just to elicit interesting reactions from people and break away from a boring, predictable, scripted verbal exchange. Sometimes, when I walk into a shop to browse and the shop assistant is there I am unsure what to do and I just awkwardly stand in a place pretending to look at various objects before walking out. I am often in awe when looking at beautiful scenery, harmonious combination of colours/lights, easthetically pleasing buldings, cozy cafes and interior design with strong consistent and well- thought-out style. I am appalled and bothered by restaurants using ugly plastic cutlery or containers. When at home, I much prefer messaging with friends or using voice messages than calling. When they ask to call me and interrupt what I am doing, I always tend to say no. Exchanging information online with friends just for the sake of exchanging information is tedious to me.

The following anecdote is a good example of how I have been generally feeling in life, especially since I started working.

There was a social event at university. A lunch during which some certificates of appreciations' would be delivered. To begin with, I always think these forced social gatherings are a waste of time, because I can see people do not really want to be there. Also, what's the point of a certificate of appreciation. Just thank me or give me a bonus if you really have to. So, I was possibly the only guy wearing a t-shirt and I felt embarrassed but also cannot fully understand why everybody conforms to wearing t-shirts just because it's the norm. There is nothing inherently unprofessional about a plain t-shirt. It fully covers the body and is not too wacky. Then, I was asked to give a speech. I tried long and hard about saying something meaningful and not just perfunctory and the main points I made were about how I enjoyed teaching optional courses because the students were genuinely interested and engaged and how we should make sure not to force students to engage in things they are not fully interested in. I also made a remark about our beautiful campus and bright, airy building, and how good it felt to work there as opposed to some dingy offices I had worked in, in the past. But I noticed some colleagues looking at me like a was an alien. I felt different and exposed, like I had shown too much of me and it clearly was not in line with how things are done.

That's it. There would be so much more I could write, but I'll stop here as this is probably already a ridiculously long post. Apologies if the post is not appropriate.",3,1760295832.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

On 23.02.2025 I put it into use, and from that day until two days ago I made about 2-3 espressos almost daily without any problems. Two days ago I weighed 18 grams of coffee beans, as I do every day for a fine double espresso, and I noticed that it was ejecting poorly, until it suddenly stopped grinding. If I turned it on again, all I could hear was the humming of the motor. Today I took it apart, because I immediately thought that the grinder was clogged. I thoroughly cleaned it of coffee deposits, set it up for reuse, and everything seemed fine. I put it back together, and started making a new fresh espresso (18g), and the same scene. Poor ejection of ground coffee and a sudden stop. So, there was a blockage again, but not a minute before that I thoroughly cleaned it and set it up as needed for proper operation.

A wall that didn't make sense; an opaque barrier sitting on the edge of our sleepy town. I was inches away from it, so close to touching it, so close to falling through. 

To my left, Lizbeth Wainwright was standing, half lidded eyes glued to it. 

On my right, Harry Carlisle blinked slowly, before stumbling back, spluttering out a sharp cry. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is going on?‚Äù

Lizbeth cocked her head, folding her arms. ‚ÄúIt's a barrier.‚Äù

Harry shot her a look. ‚ÄúYes, but why is it here?""

Lizbeth stepped forward, ignoring the kids‚Äô cries of protest. She reached out and touched it, then turned back to us with a shrug. ‚ÄúWhatever it is, it‚Äôs keeping us here.‚Äù She poked it again and licked her fingertip. ‚ÄúTastes like nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lick it!‚Äù Harry hissed.

‚ÄúRelax. I was checking to see if it was toxic,‚Äù she rolled her eyes. 

‚ÄúBy licking it?!‚Äù

There were twenty-five of us, twenty-five seventeen-year-olds standing in a line. I took a slow step back away from the line. 

I ran home. 

Mom was gone, her coffee was still warm. 

*Everyone* was gone. It was just us, swamped in a town full of fog. 

Where did the fog come from? 

Nobody knew. 

Emma Thomas was convinced it was the rapture, and we had been left behind. But then she went crazy, and threw herself into the barrier‚Äîonly to disappear. 

Until that moment, the barrier had been completely impenetrable. 

But food was running out. 

Sanity was starting to dwindle. 

We were blocked from the outside world, and breaking through was our only shot. 

We were just a group of kids becoming more and more agitated. We didn't stay at home. We went away to eat and sleep, and then we gathered in front of it again, almost like it was our fucking God. It was an enigma, a giant question mark far too advanced for our brains to understand. 

I was waiting for someone to snap and try breaking through it. Noah Price was our unwilling volunteer. 

He poked the barrier, slamming his fists into it, and we all watched, as his finger slowly slid through, almost like it welcomed him. ‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù he whispered, moving closer, sticking his entire arm through. When he turned around, I knew what he was going to do. 

‚ÄúAre you *insane*?!‚Äù Lizbeth tried to yank him back. ‚ÄúNoah, wait!‚Äù

But he was already through, already slipping into nothingness. 

Other kids followed. Noah didn't start screeching or burst into flames, so that was enough. I watched them slowly disappearing through the wall, noticing their sudden smiles of relief, like a gentle hand was coaxing them towards safety. 

When it was my turn, there were three of us left. 

Harry saluted me with a grin. ‚ÄúI guess I'll see you on the other side?‚Äù

When he disappeared, I followed. Relieved. Finally, I could go home. 

But to my confusion, it bounced me back. 

Lizbeth frowned. ""Try again. Maybe it's... confused?"" 

""It's not confused,"" I grumbled. ""It's stubborn."" I kicked the barrier, and once again, I was violently back. This thing wouldn't even let me *touch* it. 

I tried the gentle approach, like the stupid thing was alive. 

I knelt, dragging my hand across the surface, and for a moment, I thought it was going to let me through. I was too brave, attempting to plunge my hand through. This time, it spat me out, sending me skidding back. 

‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù

I pretended not to see Lizbeth‚Äôs slight smile. 

‚ÄúIt's not funny,‚Äù I said. 

Lizbeth shot me a grin. ‚ÄúDefinitely not.‚Äù

I twisted to her, hands on my hips. ‚ÄúOkay, well, why don't you try?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Lizbeth took a deep breath, tightened her blonde braid, and stepped straight through. She didn't even say goodbye. I saw her realization light up on her face. Panic. She tried to step back, tried to pull away. But she was already being consumed by light, panic in her eyes bleeding into an expression I couldn't place. 

Happiness? 

When Lizbeth was gone, I was alone. The fog was getting thicker. 

I could barely see in front of me.

I tried again, this time slowly, with just a finger. I held my breath. *Come on.* 

I squeezed my eyes shut. *Come on, you stupid fucking wall.* To my surprise, my fingertip did slip through slowly. Then my arm, down to the elbow. But my body, once again, was violently dragged back. 

Back to *pain*.

Back to bleeding out. 

Back to my shuddery breaths. 

*‚ÄùAnyone in here?‚Äù* 

The voice was so close, reality slamming into me. 

*‚ÄùCharlie, I know you're in here.‚Äù*

Blinking rapidly, I found myself pressed against clinical white tiles. 

They were familiar, covered in scribbles and smileys.  

Inside my school bathroom, my life seeped out of me in streaks of scarlet. 

Gritting my teeth, I sucked in a breath. Opposite me, Lizbeth‚Äôs head was hanging, streaks of blonde stuck to scarlet cheeks, her hand still in mine. 

Harry was curled up, unmoving, his head tipped back. 

*Footsteps.*

I held my breath, my eyes flickering, my breaths shuddering. 

The door I leaned against flew open. 

*""Found you.""*

My body slumped backwards. 

And just like that, once again I stood in front of that barrier. 

And this time, I slipped right through.

1o4xf4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o4xf4r/hr_we_saw_seashells_smile/,[HR] We Saw Seashells Smile,"It was 4:23pm when the baby appeared. It was the day after Justin‚Äôs thirteenth birthday, and he only remembers the time because it was when he was born, and ever since then it had just been floating next to Justin‚Äôs head. But it was no ordinary baby. It was a bit green, as if it‚Äôd been ill ever since it was a fetus, and pieces of flesh dangled from both of its arms in place of what had been. It occasionally used its head to gather up the flesh pieces that drooped a little too far down, a head that looked like a porcelain doll‚Äôs‚Äîa bit too glossy and eerily kept together. One morning, Justin had looked at the bathroom mirror, and that‚Äôs when he noticed its lack of eyes. It must‚Äôve been around a week or so since it appeared when he first noticed. The emptiness inside the sockets stared back at his reflection, two dark slits like those of hollow seashells.

And it‚Äôs not like he hadn‚Äôt tried to get rid of it. Justin cried and cried to his mother at first, and cried even more when his mother said she couldn‚Äôt see anything, and even more when it had been a week, a month, a year and there was no sign of the baby getting rid of itself. Justin‚Äôs mother, having always been a superstitious woman, finally brought him to a local ‚Äúwitch‚Äù that she had always known because she was her sister. But upon inspection the witch said the baby posed no harm‚Äîto this day Justin never knew whether the baby actually posed no harm, or whether it was because the witch couldn‚Äôt see it or couldn‚Äôt get rid of it. Or maybe it was both, Justin thought. And so the time passed until denial turned into reluctant half-acceptance. After all, the baby never did bother him. It didn‚Äôt talk, and it didn‚Äôt cry, but Justin could never tell because it didn‚Äôt have eyes, and it could be missing its own throat for all he knew. So it was so‚Äîjust an eyesore in the bathroom mirror. A green object that occupied an insignificant corner of his vision.

By the time Justin turned 16, the baby had turned into something more of a background noise. Like the sound of tidal waves‚Äîsilently loud, and eerily peaceful within the violence. It was one summer day, the weekend before summer break would come to an end. He and his friends decided to have one last trip to the beach before they would have to start the 11th grade.

As the boys were walking to the shore, one of the boys named Michael skipped past Justin to be in front of him and the others. He announced to the group‚Äî‚Äúhey! Last one to the shore has to swim in the ocean! Naked!‚Äù

And his skips turned into a desperate sprint. This time, the other boys were also running. They‚Äôre laughing along with him, as if they already knew that no one was actually going to strip naked, but decided to go along with it anyway.

But Justin kept his pace, as he usually does. He wasn‚Äôt going to do it anyway, and why waste precious energy on pleasing a bunch of immature teenagers?

No, he wasn‚Äôt going to move faster one bit. He was the most mature one in the group, or so he thought, and someone had to man this ship before it turns into anarchy. But to be honest, the real reason was the fact that he¬†*hated*¬†Michael. He couldn‚Äôt stand his stupidity and how everyone pretended to enjoy it. And he hated even more how everyone looked at him like the sun came out of his dick. The child act was getting old, but Michael didn‚Äôt change one bit. And frankly, Justin was sick of pretending like the act didn‚Äôt expire years ago. And that¬†*face.*¬†It‚Äôs the face he made right before he announced his stupid dare to the group, and he made that face any time he tells one of his ‚Äúfunny‚Äù jokes. Or maybe it was the face he made every waking moment of his life, for all Justin knew. The face was made in three steps. First, the corner of his lips rose like a grotesque psychopath. Then, his nose crumpled like that of a pig. Finally, his forehead crinkled up like an elephant‚Äôs armpits, and Justin every time Justin felt like a hundred people were breathing down his neck. And his eyes. Justin fights the urge to yank it out of his eye sockets every time he peered into his soul and left him feeling filthy. It enraged every single cell in Justin‚Äôs body.

It was anger that was so unwarranted‚Äîso much so that it made Justin want to play out something completely unhinged, one of the thousand different violent scenarios in his head. What angered him more was that he could tell that most people found Michael annoying but knew how to deal with him. There was simply no way people weren‚Äôt tired of Michael, but if they were, they didn‚Äôt show it. It left him frustrated because he felt so close to grasping onto the full power of shared hatred, but he never did.

‚ÄúHaha! Justin‚Äôs last, start stripping!!‚Äù

The other boys made it to the post, and eventually Justin‚Äôs pace got him there. Justin chuckled a bit, not because he thought it was funny, but just to perform up to the shared atmosphere of fake happiness. But his mind was completely taken over by an all too familiar feeling, a feeling that he felt so deeply that he knew it was finally going to boil over, after many years of festering. This day would be the catalyst. He wanted it to be the catalyst.

You see, there was a time when Justin could stand Michael, and even liked him. He liked him a lot, actually. They became close in middle school since they were the only two from middle school to have gone to the same elementary school. Then they had gone on to the same high school. Michael was always the loud one and Justin had always been the quieter one, forming an unlikely friendship, or that of a cliche one to be honest‚Äîthe outsider and it-boy. The black cat and golden retriever. Introversion and extraversion did an unlikely tango and drew out a carefully balanced yin and yang.

But that had all changed one night. It was at a party two years ago for Michael‚Äôs fourteenth birthday. Justin remembers all too well about how he felt that night. He had just received the unfortunate news from the witch that day, that there was nothing he could do about the baby, and that was that. He was really not in the mood to go to the party, but Michael had insisted. Justin kept telling him no, except Michael was all too persistent, as he always was, and Justin finally folded.

Justin remembered the regret he felt once he opened the door. He recalled the deadly concoction of teen angst‚Äìor what you call the balanced mixture of pot, B.O., and cheap liquor, and the memory of the scent made him lightheaded all over again. But just as he was about to leave Michael slung his arm over his shoulder. ‚ÄúHey, why are you in such a hurry? Come with me, let‚Äôs have some fun!‚Äù

He grabbed onto his forearm and led him towards the hallway. They walked past many faces, some faces more familiar than others but he knew them all. It was a small neighborhood after all, and they had the same mutual friends. He wondered why Michael bothered to invite all of them though. After all, there was no way he was actually friends with all of them, but Justin chose to ignore it. They were about to walk up the stairs when Michael‚Äôs dad yelled in the living room‚Äì

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for gifts!‚Äù

And all the other kids started to run towards the living room. By the time Michael and Justin got there, most of the pack had already congregated and took the couch. Justin saw a little boy that he had never seen before, and he looked weirdly out of place. He stood alone behind the coffee table, and Justin noticed that the light made him shine a little differently, but he couldn‚Äôt tell why, but he didn‚Äôt think too much of it. He made a mental note to ask Michael later. Justin and Michael sat on the floor, with Michael at the center.

He got the first box.¬†*From Aaron.*¬†And as Michael read the tag Aaron leaned towards Michael in anticipation.

‚ÄúI bet you‚Äôll like this one,‚Äù Aaron said with a giddy smile. Michael lightly chuckled in response. It was a box of sorted candies, from all kinds of different brands from all kinds of different countries.

‚ÄúI know you like candy, and I know you like trying new things, so I thought, why not combine the two together? Let me know how the mealworm lollipop tastes.‚Äù And the other kids started laughing.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know, unless I shove it into your mouth while you‚Äôre asleep!‚Äù And Aaron chuckled in response.

A few more gifts were opened. Video games, books, one guy got him a scented candle that smelled like lima beans. Or so it claimed.

‚ÄúWhat is this for?‚Äù Michael asked. And the guy snickered, ‚ÄúI got a candle that smells like you!‚Äù

Michael opened the cap and gave it a whiff. ‚ÄúIt smells like ass!‚Äù

Everyone laughed.

‚ÄúHey, language!‚Äù His dad yelled at him. And everyone laughed once more.

It was finally time for Justin‚Äôs gift. He got Michael a pocket knife. ‚ÄúI know that you like collecting pocket knives and you bring them to your boy scout trips, so I thought I‚Äôd add to your collection.‚Äù

And Michael grinned so widely with the most affectionate smile that a man could have. ‚ÄúThanks man.‚Äù

Justin could feel a slight pang at the memory.

After gifts, Michael and Justin went up to Michael‚Äôs room. Justin asked him about the boy.

‚ÄúOh yeah! I forgot to tell you, but our family adopted a little boy. His name is Dylan. You see, 3 months ago, about a week into camp, a storm separated me from the rest of the boys, and when I was trying to find my way back I saw a boy standing alone on a highway. Of course I asked him where his parents were, and he said that they went to go to the grocery store and told him to wait. And that‚Äôs when I had a feeling that they probably didn‚Äôt go grocery shopping, but decided to wait with him. I waited with him the entire day, and his parents didn‚Äôt come, of course. One of the counselors eventually found us, and we went back to the camp. I later found out the parents did indeed abandon their child, but I was only 13, so what else could I do? So I did the only thing I could do, and asked dad if I could have a baby brother. He thought I was crazy, but we welcomed him in. I‚Äôm sure it was a hard decision for dad, he spent weeks distraught, but ultimately it must‚Äôve been the hardest for Dylan. But he‚Äôs a strong kid! So I guess I have a baby brother now! I always wanted a baby brother and here we are! Hope that I can be a good big brother to him!‚Äù

Justin thought of his cousin Angelo. Anger flashed through him thinking about the idea of him being thrown on the sidewalk. And he remembered the way Michael looked at Justin after the conversation. The air felt different this time, and he remembered him staring at Justin for a bit too long.

But Justin only felt betrayed thinking of this memory. Where did this nice kid go? Why is he now the most annoying pest where every single action of his gets to his nerves? Why couldn‚Äôt Michael have been that nice to him as he was to Dylan?

As his senses returned back to the beach, the thought of this revelation channeled his anger towards resolution. He was tired of letting his hatred bottle up, and he was going to confront Michael. Show others who he really is. Show Michael who Michael really is.

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not playing your stupid games, Michael. I‚Äôm not stripping.‚Äù Justin‚Äôs voice shook, but he convinced himself that he was the only one who could hear the anxiety in his voice.

‚ÄúBut rules are rules, and you were the last one that got here. So start stripping or else‚Äì‚Äù

Justin cut him off. ‚ÄúOr else what? Do you want to see me naked that badly?‚Äù Knowing that the other boys would see it as a sly remark, but to Michael it would open a deeper wound.

The satisfaction of seeing Michael‚Äôs squeamish face might‚Äôve been enough any other day, but he couldn‚Äôt just let this one go. He wanted to completely overwhelm him, make him feel how he feels, see how he sees. Maybe Justin was a masochist because he wanted Michael to burst out crying, or whine like a baby, the way a kitten implodes in the heat of the moment, or the way a father bursts in anger when faced with confrontation. He wanted his brain to overload. He wanted to sever neural connections, until he was vegetative‚Äîuntil he either shuts down or kills someone in a fit of anger, the way a man does when he is driven to his mental edge.

Justin doubled down. ‚ÄúOh yeah? Your gay ass wants to see me naked that badly? So that you can jerk off to my naked body where I can‚Äôt see you‚Äîis that it? I‚Äôll only do it if you do it too! Or are you just all talk? Or are you too pussy to do that? Is that why?‚Äù

And this got Michael riled up. It was just as Justin wanted.

‚ÄúNo‚Äì*Justin.*‚Äù He said his name the way a person would acknowledge a pedophile.

‚ÄúHave you ever thought that I only wanted to humiliate the shit out of you?! Do you really think we don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre gay? It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre staring at me with your dick! You think we can‚Äôt tell? It‚Äôs fucking disgusting. Have you thought just maybe, maybe, we‚Äôre doing this so we can ditch you while you‚Äôre naked? So you can be naked and alone just like you deserve?‚Äù

Justin was stunned, to say the least. Because he did succeed in getting Michael angry. He riled him up, and got him to reveal a dark part of himself that no one knew about him. But words clogged up because of how vulnerable Justin felt for once, and it felt like his nerves had been set on fire. Because who was¬†*he*¬†to be disgusted. If anyone should be disgusted, it should be Justin. Because he saw the real Michael that night. Goody-two-shoes Michael. Hero-complex Michael. I-just-go-on-to-adopt-a-random-kid-out-of-the-goodenes-of-my-heart Michael. It all hides the demon inside him. The demon that he saw at that party.

Justin was about to remark when he looked at Michael and the boys. They all looked at Justin as if they‚Äôd recently found out that Justin was a government spy, but the spy was a roach. And Justin was met with the stares of all 5 boys, stares with no remote feeling of acknowledgement whatsoever, with Michael‚Äôs smirk on the other side.

Before he knew it, Justin walked towards Michael and punched him in the face.

And another punch to the face.

And another one.

Vision blurred. And fragments of that one night appeared before him.

Justin remembered when he didn‚Äôt meet Michael‚Äôs lips with his fist, but his own lips. It was short sighted, but for a second he felt whole.

A sharp pain jolted him back to his senses. He was on the beach again. Justin cupped his own cheeks with the palm of his hand. There was blood on it. He saw Michael on the other side, face red with anger. Rage.¬†*Disgust.*

It was the same face he made that night, looking back at Justin when he pulled away from the kiss. And he remembered it all again‚Äîthe feeling of realizing what he had done, and the world flooded in between the empty silences between his heartbeats, clogging his arteries, rendering him unable to breathe. Then there was no world, for it had gone black around the corners of his vision, and on the other side the only thing he could see was Michael.

And now he was looking at the ocean. Michael was dragging him into it. He was brought to his senses when the ocean water slapped his face, and he freed himself from Michael‚Äôs grasp. He landed another hit.

Justin doesn‚Äôt remember what happened after, just as he doesn‚Äôt remember the rest of that night after they kissed. It was after Michael‚Äôs face turned from disgust to something else that closely resembled anger. And Justin remembers flames. It had already been set when he pulled back from the kiss. And the next thing he remembered was being back in his own car, frantically trying to turn on the engine. The last thing he remembered was him back in his own room, trying to fall asleep.

And now he stood next to Michael. They were both waist deep in the water.

In the middle of the ocean, Justin was met with what he‚Äôd done. Michael‚Äôs nose stood pointed against the moonlight, casting a shadow across the right side of his cheeks. Out of the dark side of his nose, a streak of scarlet quietly flowed and hints of it caught onto the water droplets around his lips. And his lips. Justin saw a small cut on the upper corner of his lips.

‚ÄúWhy do you hate me so much?‚Äù

As Michael‚Äôs words reached his ears, Justin‚Äôs body was the first to react. It was as if heat emanated from the radial sources of his entire body, from his limbs to his spine, to the centers of his eyeballs to the singularity of his prefrontal cortex to the shaft of his penis‚Äîall of it, all of it bursts out radially, screaming for escape, and it is a frustration so great that for a second, a second that feels like hours, he can‚Äôt breathe.

‚ÄúI‚Äî*I*¬†hate you so much? You‚Äôre the one that treated me like I didn‚Äôt exist. You‚Äôre the one that started to look at¬†*me*¬†differently! You‚Äôre the one‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, that was you! You‚Äôre the one that‚Äì‚Äù

Justin was going to end it. He was going to end it all. ‚ÄúOh really? You don‚Äôt remember how you ignored me after we kissed, and how you proceeded to treat me for the rest of eternity? You were so disgusted at me that you proceeded to live like nothing ever happened. Then what about my bitterness? How can you go on living with that stupid face on your face while I need to suffer alone? Fuck you, and fuck all of you guys. Fuck this beach, this neighborhood, and this world. Fuck everything! You think I can live when I‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I was disgusted with myself!‚Äù

The silence after Michael‚Äôs words were even more deafening for Justin. ‚ÄúBut I tried to get you after, and‚Äîwhat was I supposed to do‚Äîwhen you‚Äî‚Äù

And then Michael stopped talking. And he looked at Justin with guilt so horrible, so horrible that it looked like the same face he made after they kissed, except this time it was no longer towards Justin, and now Justin knew that it was never meant towards him in the first place. This time, his emotions were meant for a third entity‚Äîto the silent space between them, the space that spoke of nothing because everything came to waste.

‚ÄúIt must be so easy for you. To forget the things that go against how you feel. And to remember only the way you were hurt.‚Äù

Michael faced away from Justin and started to cry.

And that‚Äôs when it finally clicked for Justin. And he was no longer angry, but embarrassed that there was nowhere else for him to channel his anger to. He looked at Michael, a Michael that no longer looked at him, but the coast in front of him‚Äîa life he was trying so hard to protect, that he was drowning in it. A life that Justin was trying so hard to run away from, that it slowly burned away at his flesh.

For the first time in a long time, Justin cried. He cried for everything, but everything was nothing at all. He cried for time lost, time that never existed in the first place. Heartbreak, a heartbreak that never held weight. A life, life that had never fully realized what it meant. And he walked towards Michael, reaching for him, but even as he kept walking the distance between them never closed.

The baby. Justin looked at the baby, and it now looked at him. He could tell that it was also crying. Maybe it finally understands him after all. It took one more look at Justin, and with a desolate face turned full of determination, floated away from Justin towards Michael. It sat on top of Michael‚Äôs head, and for a second and for a second only, it only sat. Nothing different happened, and all hope felt lost for a moment.

Then Michael finally turned to him, and Justin sighed a breath of relief. For a second, there was a hope for a life that he had been too scared to want. But Justin didn‚Äôt even have the time to process what happened next, until he saw blood gushing out of Michael‚Äôs index finger, an index finger that was no longer there and in his own mouth. Then he started to chew it. And then he started to chew away the rest of his fingers, eating each one through bone. And after that he started chewing his forearm, but his teeth started to break, and fragments of chipped teeth stuck alongside his forearm. So Michael took out his pocket knife, the birthday gift that Justin got him for his fourteenth birthday, and started to hack at his own arm. Justin felt his legs moving towards Michael, but his brain wasn‚Äôt processing his movement. There was too much going on inside of him. There were tears, or it might‚Äôve just been the ocean. There was the sound of wind, or it might‚Äôve been his hyperventilating. Feet brushed against the sand beneath, sand that seemed to stretch for infinity, because he wasn‚Äôt getting closer.

Michael had started on his other arm, and Justin thought he was yelling at him to stop, but he couldn‚Äôt tell. Maybe it‚Äôll all stop after he is done with both arms, just like the baby, and Justin will wake up from this dream. Maybe it‚Äôs a dream that started from the night of his 13th birthday, and this is the grand finale. He‚Äôll wake up and there is no Michael. There is no green baby.

Michael was done eating both of his arms, and floated silently on the surface of the ocean. The baby let go of the body and came back to Justin.

Justin walked to shore. He walked past his friends. One of his friends was questioning him.

‚ÄúWhat were you thinking? We were all so worried about you. We thought you had gone and‚Äî.‚Äù

Justin didn‚Äôt hear the rest. He just walked back, back towards the coastline, towards the parking lot and into his car. He turned on his car to drive home, like it was any other day. The summer breeze was about to end. After all, he‚Äôll be going to high school now, and who knows what kind of summer awaits him? Summer may never be the same. He sat there and looked towards the ocean another time. He watched the sunset. In some ways, the Earth is playing an endless game of tag. Like a golf ball that spins around a hole but never makes it in, it chases the sun, and maybe it thinks that it is. But the sun sets every single day, and the Earth starts its game once anew. He looked at the vastness of the ocean. He wonders what stories it holds, and what stories await him. With a small prayer, he drove back home, snuggles into the comforter of his bed, and goes to sleep.",1,1760295377.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1o4xdtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1o4xdtk/purity/,Purity,"She came through the front door smiling, wearing a pale dress and a name that smelled like cheap soap. My grandmother said that with her, the house would finally be filled with good manners, flowers, and Sunday mass. But the flowers rotted before the petals opened, and the air began to smell of burnt oil and old skin. It was as if the walls themselves had started to sweat.  
I was a child and didn‚Äôt understand much, but I saw how things shrank when she touched them: tablecloths wrinkled by themselves, clocks fell behind. Even my mother‚Äôs voice grew thinner, as if *she* were sucking the air from her every time she embraced her.

After she moved in, the house began to fall ill. The dining room clock lost its pulse‚Äîfirst a minute, then two‚Äîuntil the hours stuck to noon like flies on honey. The air grew thick, tasted of stale grease and dead tongue. When I breathed, it felt like someone had fried my lungs, leaving an oily film in my throat. We opened the windows, but the smell always returned, stronger, as if it were coming from our clothes, from our own mouths. No one said it aloud, but we all learned to breathe less.  
My grandmother, who once ruled the kitchen, withdrew to her room. She said the fire made her dizzy, but in truth, fire no longer obeyed her. My mother spent her days between the cries of the twins‚ÄîDiego and Daniela‚Äîand the soft commands of the woman who spoke in a whisper.  
‚ÄúJust a little favor, comadre... you do it better than I do.‚Äù  
And so, the house began to tilt toward her. The beams creaked with devotion; the ceiling seemed to bow, as if wanting to serve her as an altar.

When the twins were born, people brought blessings, flowers, and knitted hats. But the flowers withered in less than three days, and the hats unraveled on the children‚Äôs heads. Daniela fell sick early. She twisted under the full moon, eyes rolled back, thick drool hanging from her chin. Sometimes she stared at the ceiling, smiling with clenched teeth, as if someone invisible were whispering from above.  
She called them divine punishments. The bottle of anticonvulsants stayed sealed in a drawer, replaced by lukewarm holy water and thick smoke that smelled of burnt bone.

At night, the prayers crept up the stairs like a sticky tide while oil hissed on the stove. Through the crack in the door, I watched‚Äîmy mother crying without sound, her hands trembling, while *she* pressed her palms against Daniela‚Äôs forehead, lips moving in a language that should have stayed buried. Sometimes the child‚Äôs body arched, sometimes it went stiff‚Äîand even as a little girl, I knew that what moved in her didn‚Äôt come from heaven.

Then came the rules.  
Who ate first.  
What kind of oil was used for each body.  
Who could speak, and when.  
Diego, the other twin, didn‚Äôt stand up until she looked at him; Rub√©n, her husband and my uncle, waited for the nod of her head. She touched shoulders, corrected hands, distributed leftover food as if tuning an invisible instrument. ‚ÄúOrder,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúis the highest form of love.‚Äù  
But they lived in filth. Every empty jar, every lidless can, every plastic bag folded with a nun‚Äôs precision. Stained clothes, food slowly rotting inside the fridge‚Äôs compartments, bent spoons carrying the memory of old mouths. That floor of our house wasn‚Äôt clean, nor chaotic‚Äîjust a motionless balance, a tidy rot that smelled like confinement.

Animals began to avoid her. The cat no longer slept on her bed‚Äîhe hid under the furniture, whiskers singed, tail cut. The twins‚Äô puppy, Katy, peed herself every time *she* spoke, as if her voice carried an invisible electric charge. When she reached to pet my own puppy, my mother yanked me by the arm with dry force.  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let her touch him,‚Äù she whispered between her teeth.  
‚ÄúNot him. Not you.‚Äù  
And in that moment, I learned that fear also has a scent.

That night, every clock in the house stopped. Wall clocks, wristwatches, even the cuckoo in the dining room. Time refused to move the instant Daniela screamed. It wasn‚Äôt a sick child‚Äôs cry‚Äîit was the sound of a truth understood: the air itself rejected her.  
She ran through the corridors, rosary tangled in her hands. Prayers multiplied like flies over raw meat. My mother pushed me toward my room, but I still managed to peek through the crack: Daniela twisting on the bed, her body warped by her mother‚Äôs demonic faith. She rubbed hot oil on the child‚Äôs forehead‚Äîso hot it blistered the skin‚Äîand the smell of burned flesh merged with incense. In the dim light, my uncle Rub√©n wept silently, staring at his palms while Diego repeated the prayers in a mechanical voice.

After that night, Daniela stopped speaking. She walked with a rosary around her neck, always behind *her*, as if pulled by an invisible string. Her steps no longer made a sound, only the faint click of beads striking her skin. She went to bed before sunset, but her eyes stayed open, fixed on the door, waiting for something only she could hear.  
Diego, on the other hand, became her mirror. Obedient. Smiling. Eating in silence. Calm in the way fear learns to pretend. Even his shadow moved with delay, as though waiting for permission. He had learned to breathe only when *she* exhaled. The opposite of the possessed daughter‚Äîhe was *her* last hope for normalcy.

I don‚Äôt know when she began to notice me. Maybe when she realized I could still look at her without lowering my eyes. She started inviting me to her table, with the rest of her dead.  
One night, she offered me a glass of warm milk. A yellowish foam floated on top, like curdled fat.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôll make you strong.‚Äù  
I held it but didn‚Äôt drink. The smell was sour, like milk that had aged while waiting for someone foolish enough to be cared for. That was the first night I forced myself to vomit.  
And that night, I dreamed of a cord.  
It came out from Daniela‚Äôs chest and disappeared into her mother‚Äôs body. I tried to cut it, but the knife melted in my hand, and from the soft blade dripped warm milk that smelled like a womb.  
Then I heard her whisper in my ear:  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt break what binds us. There is no love purer than this.‚Äù

For a while, we thought she had surrendered‚Äîthat the thing haunting the house was stronger than her, and that her children were only victims of whatever consumed her. Convenient, wasn‚Äôt it?  
One day, they left. My mother and I rejoiced quietly because the house finally breathed again. The air stopped smelling of reheated oil, our shadows regained their shape. There were no midnight prayers, no spoiled milk, no plastic bags stacked in the kitchen corner. For the first time in years, we slept without feeling watched from the threshold.

But relief, I later learned, is only a shed skin.  
Hell doesn‚Äôt vanish‚Äîit changes bodies.

Years passed, and none of them set foot in our house again.  
She had found a new place, and one day we were invited‚ÄîDiego‚Äôs birthday.  
I remember stepping through the door and *feeling it*: that smell.  
It wasn‚Äôt memory. It was the same air, rancid and thick, reaching out to recognize us.  
The walls sweated grease, moisture, and burnt rubber. Daniela wasn‚Äôt there. She‚Äôd escaped, blessed be her courage. She fled so far that her voice never returned‚Äînot even in letters with no return address. She erased herself from the map and from memory.

My uncle, though, stayed. He aged overnight, spoke to himself, begged forgiveness between shallow breaths. He said his heart wasn‚Äôt his anymore‚Äîthat she had filled it with old oil and left it to cool.  
Sometimes I imagine it: his veins hardened, his heart beating slowly, like a burner running at 25%.

Diego was there. The good, perfect son. The one who never shone too bright. The one grateful for sacrifice, and ashamed of mercy.  
No one knows what keeps them together, but I‚Äôve seen it. That cord‚Äîalmost invisible‚Äîrising from his navel, disappearing beneath her dress. Sometimes it trembles, sometimes it pulses.  
It‚Äôs a living cord, moist, warm, like a sleeping snake between them.  
She feeds it with her voice, her sorrow, her sharp tears.  
He responds with obedience, with perfect silence.  
They breathe together, contract and release in the same rhythm.  
Sometimes I think they haven‚Äôt been two for years.  
That they devoured each other long ago.  
And now they are one body‚Äîone that doesn‚Äôt know death, because it feeds on the fear of still being alive.

A few days ago, my uncle Rub√©n came to visit. He brought warm bread and dark coffee. Spoke of Daniela, her new life, a place where the air doesn‚Äôt hurt‚Äîand for a moment, I believed his voice had been saved.

Until I asked about Diego.

His face changed. It was as if his soul shrank inside his chest.  
He‚Äôs not a man of many words, but the question broke the dam he had built with the little heart he had left.  
He said that two nights ago, he crept up the stairs without making a sound. She had said Diego was sick, that the hallway air could kill him. But that night he heard something‚Äîa child‚Äôs sobbing, a voice that shouldn‚Äôt have been there.

He knocked. No answer.  
He turned the handle and went in.

The smell hit first: sour milk and sweet sweat.  
Then the shadows.  
She was sitting on the bed, and on her lap, Diego. His head rested against her chest, eyes open and glistening while she whispered with a small, serene smile.  
My uncle saw Diego‚Äôs lips latched onto one of her nipples, sucking with desperation, shame, and hunger. Thick, warm milk dripped down, forming white threads that cooled on the floor like fresh slug trails.  
He wanted to scream, but the air turned to glass in his throat.  
She looked up.

‚ÄúShhhhh... he‚Äôs sleeping.‚Äù

And in that instant, we understood Diego no longer existed‚Äîthat she had swallowed him whole.

Since that night, my uncle lives with us. Sometimes, while he sleeps, a thick, almost black oil leaks from his ears. It smells of metal and boiled milk. He says it doesn‚Äôt hurt, but the sound of it dripping is the same as when she kept the oil burning.  
He speaks little.  
He doesn‚Äôt look at fire.  
He doesn‚Äôt eat anything that shines.

And Diego... Diego remains there, in the new house, where the walls sweat grease.  
The cord between them is red now, swollen with sour milk.  
Sometimes, neighbors say, they hear a child‚Äôs voice behind the windows.  
A voice that babbles words that don‚Äôt exist.

And every time the wind blows from that direction, it brings the smell of burnt oil...  
and a sticky haze that seeps through the nose, the mouth‚Äîinto dreams.",1,1760295294.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

Diego, on the other hand, became her mirror. Obedient. Smiling. Eating in silence. Calm in the way fear learns to pretend. Even his shadow moved with delay, as though waiting for permission.

His face changed. It was as if his soul shrank inside his chest.  
He‚Äôs not a man of many words, but the question broke the dam he had built with the little heart he had left.

He wanted to scream, but the air turned to glass in his throat.  
She looked up.

‚ÄúShhhhh... he‚Äôs sleeping.‚Äù

And in that instant, we understood Diego no longer existed‚Äîthat she had swallowed him whole.

Since that night, my uncle lives with us. Sometimes, while he sleeps, a thick, almost black oil leaks from his ears. It smells of metal and boiled milk. He says it doesn‚Äôt hurt, but the sound of it dripping is the same as when she kept the oil burning.  
He speaks little.  
He doesn‚Äôt look at fire.  
He doesn‚Äôt eat anything that shines.

And Diego... Diego remains there, in the new house, where the walls sweat grease.

My grandmother said that with her, the house would finally be filled with good manners, flowers, and Sunday mass. But the flowers rotted before the petals opened, and the air began to smell of burnt oil and old skin. It was as if the walls themselves had started to sweat.  
I was a child and didn‚Äôt understand much, but I saw how things shrank when she touched them: tablecloths wrinkled by themselves, clocks fell behind. Even my mother‚Äôs voice grew thinner, as if *she* were sucking the air from her every time she embraced her.

After she moved in, the house began to fall ill. The dining room clock lost its pulse‚Äîfirst a minute, then two‚Äîuntil the hours stuck to noon like flies on honey. The air grew thick, tasted of stale grease and dead tongue. When I breathed, it felt like someone had fried my lungs, leaving an oily film in my throat. We opened the windows, but the smell always returned, stronger, as if it were coming from our clothes, from our own mouths. No one said it aloud, but we all learned to breathe less.  
My grandmother, who once ruled the kitchen, withdrew to her room. She said the fire made her dizzy, but in truth, fire no longer obeyed her. My mother spent her days between the cries of the twins‚ÄîDiego and Daniela‚Äîand the soft commands of the woman who spoke in a whisper.  
‚ÄúJust a little favor, comadre... you do it better than I do.‚Äù  
And so, the house began to tilt toward her. The beams creaked with devotion; the ceiling seemed to bow, as if wanting to serve her as an altar.

When the twins were born, people brought blessings, flowers, and knitted hats. But the flowers withered in less than three days, and the hats unraveled on the children‚Äôs heads. Daniela fell sick early. She twisted under the full moon, eyes rolled back, thick drool hanging from her chin. Sometimes she stared at the ceiling, smiling with clenched teeth, as if someone invisible were whispering from above.  
She called them divine punishments. The bottle of anticonvulsants stayed sealed in a drawer, replaced by lukewarm holy water and thick smoke that smelled of burnt bone.

At night, the prayers crept up the stairs like a sticky tide while oil hissed on the stove. Through the crack in the door, I watched‚Äîmy mother crying without sound, her hands trembling, while *she* pressed her palms against Daniela‚Äôs forehead, lips moving in a language that should have stayed buried. Sometimes the child‚Äôs body arched, sometimes it went stiff‚Äîand even as a little girl, I knew that what moved in her didn‚Äôt come from heaven.

Then came the rules.  
Who ate first.  
What kind of oil was used for each body.  
Who could speak, and when.  
Diego, the other twin, didn‚Äôt stand up until she looked at him; Rub√©n, her husband and my uncle, waited for the nod of her head. She touched shoulders, corrected hands, distributed leftover food as if tuning an invisible instrument. ‚ÄúOrder,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúis the highest form of love.‚Äù  
But they lived in filth. Every empty jar, every lidless can, every plastic bag folded with a nun‚Äôs precision. Stained clothes, food slowly rotting inside the fridge‚Äôs compartments, bent spoons carrying the memory of old mouths. That floor of our house wasn‚Äôt clean, nor chaotic‚Äîjust a motionless balance, a tidy rot that smelled like confinement.

Animals began to avoid her. The cat no longer slept on her bed‚Äîhe hid under the furniture, whiskers singed, tail cut. The twins‚Äô puppy, Katy, peed herself every time *she* spoke, as if her voice carried an invisible electric charge. When she reached to pet my own puppy, my mother yanked me by the arm with dry force.  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let her touch him,‚Äù she whispered between her teeth.  
‚ÄúNot him. Not you.‚Äù  
And in that moment, I learned that fear also has a scent.

That night, every clock in the house stopped. Wall clocks, wristwatches, even the cuckoo in the dining room. Time refused to move the instant Daniela screamed. It wasn‚Äôt a sick child‚Äôs cry‚Äîit was the sound of a truth understood: the air itself rejected her.  
She ran through the corridors, rosary tangled in her hands. Prayers multiplied like flies over raw meat. My mother pushed me toward my room, but I still managed to peek through the crack: Daniela twisting on the bed, her body warped by her mother‚Äôs demonic faith.

(Known the bride distantly for a year or so)  

For context, I‚Äôve been to many (50 or so) dry weddings before due to cultural and religious norms outside the USA. However, those wedding compensated alcohol with a great time on the dance floor, dancing, hooting and hollering, etc. 

We had to travel a long way to get to this wedding, and we were shocked to learn that no alcohol is served during cocktail hour or throughout the night. I didn‚Äôt mind this, but once the reception started and I saw people sitting and drinking coffee and the shitty music and food, I knew we were doomed. It was disappointing because we drove in dancing to 70/80 classics and we were ready to hype everyone up! 

On the bright side, I will never be blindsided by surprises like this again‚Ä¶I‚Äôll always be prepared.

My grandmother said that with her, the house would finally be filled with good manners, flowers, and Sunday mass. But the flowers rotted before the petals opened, and the air began to smell of burnt oil and old skin. It was as if the walls themselves had started to sweat.  
I was a child and didn‚Äôt understand much, but I saw how things shrank when she touched them: tablecloths wrinkled by themselves, clocks fell behind. Even my mother‚Äôs voice grew thinner, as if *she* were sucking the air from her every time she embraced her.

After she moved in, the house began to fall ill. The dining room clock lost its pulse‚Äîfirst a minute, then two‚Äîuntil the hours stuck to noon like flies on honey. The air grew thick, tasted of stale grease and dead tongue. When I breathed, it felt like someone had fried my lungs, leaving an oily film in my throat. We opened the windows, but the smell always returned, stronger, as if it were coming from our clothes, from our own mouths. No one said it aloud, but we all learned to breathe less.  
My grandmother, who once ruled the kitchen, withdrew to her room. She said the fire made her dizzy, but in truth, fire no longer obeyed her. My mother spent her days between the cries of the twins‚ÄîDiego and Daniela‚Äîand the soft commands of the woman who spoke in a whisper.  
‚ÄúJust a little favor, comadre... you do it better than I do.‚Äù  
And so, the house began to tilt toward her. The beams creaked with devotion; the ceiling seemed to bow, as if wanting to serve her as an altar.

When the twins were born, people brought blessings, flowers, and knitted hats. But the flowers withered in less than three days, and the hats unraveled on the children‚Äôs heads. Daniela fell sick early. She twisted under the full moon, eyes rolled back, thick drool hanging from her chin. Sometimes she stared at the ceiling, smiling with clenched teeth, as if someone invisible were whispering from above.  
She called them divine punishments. The bottle of anticonvulsants stayed sealed in a drawer, replaced by lukewarm holy water and thick smoke that smelled of burnt bone.

At night, the prayers crept up the stairs like a sticky tide while oil hissed on the stove. Through the crack in the door, I watched‚Äîmy mother crying without sound, her hands trembling, while *she* pressed her palms against Daniela‚Äôs forehead, lips moving in a language that should have stayed buried. Sometimes the child‚Äôs body arched, sometimes it went stiff‚Äîand even as a little girl, I knew that what moved in her didn‚Äôt come from heaven.

Then came the rules.  
Who ate first.  
What kind of oil was used for each body.  
Who could speak, and when.  
Diego, the other twin, didn‚Äôt stand up until she looked at him; Rub√©n, her husband and my uncle, waited for the nod of her head. She touched shoulders, corrected hands, distributed leftover food as if tuning an invisible instrument. ‚ÄúOrder,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúis the highest form of love.‚Äù  
But they lived in filth. Every empty jar, every lidless can, every plastic bag folded with a nun‚Äôs precision. Stained clothes, food slowly rotting inside the fridge‚Äôs compartments, bent spoons carrying the memory of old mouths. That floor of our house wasn‚Äôt clean, nor chaotic‚Äîjust a motionless balance, a tidy rot that smelled like confinement.

Animals began to avoid her. The cat no longer slept on her bed‚Äîhe hid under the furniture, whiskers singed, tail cut. The twins‚Äô puppy, Katy, peed herself every time *she* spoke, as if her voice carried an invisible electric charge. When she reached to pet my own puppy, my mother yanked me by the arm with dry force.  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let her touch him,‚Äù she whispered between her teeth.  
‚ÄúNot him. Not you.‚Äù  
And in that moment, I learned that fear also has a scent.

That night, every clock in the house stopped. Wall clocks, wristwatches, even the cuckoo in the dining room. Time refused to move the instant Daniela screamed. It wasn‚Äôt a sick child‚Äôs cry‚Äîit was the sound of a truth understood: the air itself rejected her.  
She ran through the corridors, rosary tangled in her hands. Prayers multiplied like flies over raw meat. My mother pushed me toward my room, but I still managed to peek through the crack: Daniela twisting on the bed, her body warped by her mother‚Äôs demonic faith. She rubbed hot oil on the child‚Äôs forehead‚Äîso hot it blistered the skin‚Äîand the smell of burned flesh merged with incense. In the dim light, my uncle Rub√©n wept silently, staring at his palms while Diego repeated the prayers in a mechanical voice.

After that night, Daniela stopped speaking. She walked with a rosary around her neck, always behind *her*, as if pulled by an invisible string. Her steps no longer made a sound, only the faint click of beads striking her skin. She went to bed before sunset, but her eyes stayed open, fixed on the door, waiting for something only she could hear.  
Diego, on the other hand, became her mirror. Obedient. Smiling. Eating in silence. Calm in the way fear learns to pretend. Even his shadow moved with delay, as though waiting for permission. He had learned to breathe only when *she* exhaled. The opposite of the possessed daughter‚Äîhe was *her* last hope for normalcy.

I don‚Äôt know when she began to notice me. Maybe when she realized I could still look at her without lowering my eyes. She started inviting me to her table, with the rest of her dead.  
One night, she offered me a glass of warm milk. A yellowish foam floated on top, like curdled fat.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôll make you strong.‚Äù  
I held it but didn‚Äôt drink. The smell was sour, like milk that had aged while waiting for someone foolish enough to be cared for. That was the first night I forced myself to vomit.  
And that night, I dreamed of a cord.  
It came out from Daniela‚Äôs chest and disappeared into her mother‚Äôs body. I tried to cut it, but the knife melted in my hand, and from the soft blade dripped warm milk that smelled like a womb.  
Then I heard her whisper in my ear:  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt break what binds us. There is no love purer than this.‚Äù

For a while, we thought she had surrendered‚Äîthat the thing haunting the house was stronger than her, and that her children were only victims of whatever consumed her. Convenient, wasn‚Äôt it?  
One day, they left. My mother and I rejoiced quietly because the house finally breathed again. The air stopped smelling of reheated oil, our shadows regained their shape. There were no midnight prayers, no spoiled milk, no plastic bags stacked in the kitchen corner. For the first time in years, we slept without feeling watched from the threshold.

But relief, I later learned, is only a shed skin.  
Hell doesn‚Äôt vanish‚Äîit changes bodies.

Years passed, and none of them set foot in our house again.  
She had found a new place, and one day we were invited‚ÄîDiego‚Äôs birthday.  
I remember stepping through the door and *feeling it*: that smell.  
It wasn‚Äôt memory. It was the same air, rancid and thick, reaching out to recognize us.  
The walls sweated grease, moisture, and burnt rubber. Daniela wasn‚Äôt there. She‚Äôd escaped, blessed be her courage. She fled so far that her voice never returned‚Äînot even in letters with no return address. She erased herself from the map and from memory.

My uncle, though, stayed. He aged overnight, spoke to himself, begged forgiveness between shallow breaths. He said his heart wasn‚Äôt his anymore‚Äîthat she had filled it with old oil and left it to cool.  
Sometimes I imagine it: his veins hardened, his heart beating slowly, like a burner running at 25%.

Diego was there. The good, perfect son. The one who never shone too bright. The one grateful for sacrifice, and ashamed of mercy.  
No one knows what keeps them together, but I‚Äôve seen it. That cord‚Äîalmost invisible‚Äîrising from his navel, disappearing beneath her dress. Sometimes it trembles, sometimes it pulses.  
It‚Äôs a living cord, moist, warm, like a sleeping snake between them.  
She feeds it with her voice, her sorrow, her sharp tears.  
He responds with obedience, with perfect silence.  
They breathe together, contract and release in the same rhythm.  
Sometimes I think they haven‚Äôt been two for years.  
That they devoured each other long ago.  
And now they are one body‚Äîone that doesn‚Äôt know death, because it feeds on the fear of still being alive.

A few days ago, my uncle Rub√©n came to visit. He brought warm bread and dark coffee. Spoke of Daniela, her new life, a place where the air doesn‚Äôt hurt‚Äîand for a moment, I believed his voice had been saved.

Until I asked about Diego.

His face changed. It was as if his soul shrank inside his chest.  
He‚Äôs not a man of many words, but the question broke the dam he had built with the little heart he had left.  
He said that two nights ago, he crept up the stairs without making a sound. She had said Diego was sick, that the hallway air could kill him. But that night he heard something‚Äîa child‚Äôs sobbing, a voice that shouldn‚Äôt have been there.

He knocked. No answer.  
He turned the handle and went in.

The smell hit first: sour milk and sweet sweat.  
Then the shadows.  
She was sitting on the bed, and on her lap, Diego. His head rested against her chest, eyes open and glistening while she whispered with a small, serene smile.  
My uncle saw Diego‚Äôs lips latched onto one of her nipples, sucking with desperation, shame, and hunger. Thick, warm milk dripped down, forming white threads that cooled on the floor like fresh slug trails.  
He wanted to scream, but the air turned to glass in his throat.  
She looked up.

‚ÄúShhhhh... he‚Äôs sleeping.‚Äù

And in that instant, we understood Diego no longer existed‚Äîthat she had swallowed him whole.

Since that night, my uncle lives with us. Sometimes, while he sleeps, a thick, almost black oil leaks from his ears. It smells of metal and boiled milk. He says it doesn‚Äôt hurt, but the sound of it dripping is the same as when she kept the oil burning.  
He speaks little.  
He doesn‚Äôt look at fire.  
He doesn‚Äôt eat anything that shines.

And Diego... Diego remains there, in the new house, where the walls sweat grease.  
The cord between them is red now, swollen with sour milk.  
Sometimes, neighbors say, they hear a child‚Äôs voice behind the windows.  
A voice that babbles words that don‚Äôt exist.

And every time the wind blows from that direction, it brings the smell of burnt oil...

I‚Äôm looking to buy a handheld *specifically* for gaming outside the house. I already have a Steam Deck and a powerful PC at home, so this would be for daily use, when I go out for a coffee, sit in the car, take the subway, bus, etc.

# What I‚Äôm looking for / how I‚Äôll use it:

* I mainly play **GBA games**, especially **Pok√©mon hackroms**.
* I also enjoy **platformers** like *Mario* and *Sonic*.
* Sometimes I carry a **small sling bag**, but other times I only have **pockets**, so **portability matters a lot**.
* I‚Äôm a **very visual person,** **screen quality is extremely important** (sharpness, outdoor brightness, colors, reflections, no light bleed).
* I don‚Äôt need power for AAA games, I care more about **quick boot, good D-pad, solid inputs, and decent battery life**.

# Handhelds I‚Äôm considering (can‚Äôt decide):

* **Trimui Brick** (looks cute but might be *too* tiny)
* **RG34XX SP**
* **RG34XX** 
* **RG35XX Pro**
* **Retroid Pocket Classic**
* **Retroid Flip 2** (I know it‚Äôs above my budget, but I really like the format and screen)

**Budget:** around eur **120‚Äì150** (I could stretch it a bit if something‚Äôs really worth it)

  
If there‚Äôs another handheld in that price range (or slightly above) with an **excellent screen**, **great D-pad**, and **true pocketability**, I‚Äôd love to hear it.

Which one would you recommend and why? üôè",1,1760295116.0,RetroHandhelds,0,1.0,False

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll make you strong.‚Äù  
I held it but didn‚Äôt drink. The smell was sour, like milk that had aged while waiting for someone foolish enough to be cared for. That was the first night I forced myself to vomit.  
And that night, I dreamed of a cord.  
It came out from Daniela‚Äôs chest and disappeared into her mother‚Äôs body. I tried to cut it, but the knife melted in my hand, and from the soft blade dripped warm milk that smelled like a womb.  
Then I heard her whisper in my ear:  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt break what binds us. There is no love purer than this.‚Äù

For a while, we thought she had surrendered‚Äîthat the thing haunting the house was stronger than her, and that her children were only victims of whatever consumed her. Convenient, wasn‚Äôt it?  
One day, they left. My mother and I rejoiced quietly because the house finally breathed again. The air stopped smelling of reheated oil, our shadows regained their shape. There were no midnight prayers, no spoiled milk, no plastic bags stacked in the kitchen corner. For the first time in years, we slept without feeling watched from the threshold.

But relief, I later learned, is only a shed skin.  
Hell doesn‚Äôt vanish‚Äîit changes bodies.

Years passed, and none of them set foot in our house again.  
She had found a new place, and one day we were invited‚ÄîDiego‚Äôs birthday.  
I remember stepping through the door and *feeling it*: that smell.  
It wasn‚Äôt memory. It was the same air, rancid and thick, reaching out to recognize us.  
The walls sweated grease, moisture, and burnt rubber. Daniela wasn‚Äôt there. She‚Äôd escaped, blessed be her courage. She fled so far that her voice never returned‚Äînot even in letters with no return address. She erased herself from the map and from memory.

My uncle, though, stayed. He aged overnight, spoke to himself, begged forgiveness between shallow breaths. He said his heart wasn‚Äôt his anymore‚Äîthat she had filled it with old oil and left it to cool.  
Sometimes I imagine it: his veins hardened, his heart beating slowly, like a burner running at 25%.

Diego was there. The good, perfect son. The one who never shone too bright. The one grateful for sacrifice, and ashamed of mercy.  
No one knows what keeps them together, but I‚Äôve seen it. That cord‚Äîalmost invisible‚Äîrising from his navel, disappearing beneath her dress. Sometimes it trembles, sometimes it pulses.  
It‚Äôs a living cord, moist, warm, like a sleeping snake between them.  
She feeds it with her voice, her sorrow, her sharp tears.  
He responds with obedience, with perfect silence.  
They breathe together, contract and release in the same rhythm.  
Sometimes I think they haven‚Äôt been two for years.  
That they devoured each other long ago.  
And now they are one body‚Äîone that doesn‚Äôt know death, because it feeds on the fear of still being alive.

A few days ago, my uncle Rub√©n came to visit. He brought warm bread and dark coffee. Spoke of Daniela, her new life, a place where the air doesn‚Äôt hurt‚Äîand for a moment, I believed his voice had been saved.

Until I asked about Diego.

His face changed. It was as if his soul shrank inside his chest.  
He‚Äôs not a man of many words, but the question broke the dam he had built with the little heart he had left.  
He said that two nights ago, he crept up the stairs without making a sound. She had said Diego was sick, that the hallway air could kill him. But that night he heard something‚Äîa child‚Äôs sobbing, a voice that shouldn‚Äôt have been there.

He knocked. No answer.  
He turned the handle and went in.

The smell hit first: sour milk and sweet sweat.  
Then the shadows.  
She was sitting on the bed, and on her lap, Diego. His head rested against her chest, eyes open and glistening while she whispered with a small, serene smile.  
My uncle saw Diego‚Äôs lips latched onto one of her nipples, sucking with desperation, shame, and hunger. Thick, warm milk dripped down, forming white threads that cooled on the floor like fresh slug trails.  
He wanted to scream, but the air turned to glass in his throat.  
She looked up.

‚ÄúShhhhh... he‚Äôs sleeping.‚Äù

And in that instant, we understood Diego no longer existed‚Äîthat she had swallowed him whole.

Since that night, my uncle lives with us. Sometimes, while he sleeps, a thick, almost black oil leaks from his ears. It smells of metal and boiled milk. He says it doesn‚Äôt hurt, but the sound of it dripping is the same as when she kept the oil burning.  
He speaks little.  
He doesn‚Äôt look at fire.  
He doesn‚Äôt eat anything that shines.

And Diego... Diego remains there, in the new house, where the walls sweat grease.  
The cord between them is red now, swollen with sour milk.  
Sometimes, neighbors say, they hear a child‚Äôs voice behind the windows.  
A voice that babbles words that don‚Äôt exist.

And every time the wind blows from that direction, it brings the smell of burnt oil...

I‚Äôm looking to buy a handheld *specifically* for gaming outside the house. I already have a Steam Deck and a powerful PC at home, so this would be for daily use, when I go out for a coffee, sit in the car, take the subway, bus, etc.

# What I‚Äôm looking for / how I‚Äôll use it:

* I mainly play **GBA games**, especially **Pok√©mon hackroms**.
* I also enjoy **platformers** like *Mario* and *Sonic*.
* Sometimes I carry a **small sling bag**, but other times I only have **pockets**, so **portability matters a lot**.
* I‚Äôm a **very visual person,** **screen quality is extremely important** (sharpness, outdoor brightness, colors, reflections, no light bleed).
* I don‚Äôt need power for AAA games, I care more about **quick boot, good D-pad, solid inputs, and decent battery life**.

# Handhelds I‚Äôm considering (can‚Äôt decide):

* **Trimui Brick** (looks cute but might be *too* tiny)
* **RG34XX SP**
* **RG34XX** 
* **RG35XX Pro**
* **Retroid Pocket Classic**
* **Retroid Flip 2** (I know it‚Äôs above my budget, but I really like the format and screen)

**Budget:** around eur **120‚Äì150** (I could stretch it a bit if something‚Äôs really worth it)

  
If there‚Äôs another handheld in that price range (or slightly above) with an **excellent screen**, **great D-pad**, and **true pocketability**, I‚Äôd love to hear it.

1o4xapl,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1o4xapl/purity/,Purity,"She came through the front door smiling, wearing a pale dress and a name that smelled like cheap soap. My grandmother said that with her, the house would finally be filled with good manners, flowers, and Sunday mass. But the flowers rotted before the petals opened, and the air began to smell of burnt oil and old skin. It was as if the walls themselves had started to sweat.  
I was a child and didn‚Äôt understand much, but I saw how things shrank when she touched them: tablecloths wrinkled by themselves, clocks fell behind. Even my mother‚Äôs voice grew thinner, as if *she* were sucking the air from her every time she embraced her.

After she moved in, the house began to fall ill. The dining room clock lost its pulse‚Äîfirst a minute, then two‚Äîuntil the hours stuck to noon like flies on honey. The air grew thick, tasted of stale grease and dead tongue. When I breathed, it felt like someone had fried my lungs, leaving an oily film in my throat. We opened the windows, but the smell always returned, stronger, as if it were coming from our clothes, from our own mouths. No one said it aloud, but we all learned to breathe less.  
My grandmother, who once ruled the kitchen, withdrew to her room. She said the fire made her dizzy, but in truth, fire no longer obeyed her. My mother spent her days between the cries of the twins‚ÄîDiego and Daniela‚Äîand the soft commands of the woman who spoke in a whisper.  
‚ÄúJust a little favor, comadre... you do it better than I do.‚Äù  
And so, the house began to tilt toward her. The beams creaked with devotion; the ceiling seemed to bow, as if wanting to serve her as an altar.

When the twins were born, people brought blessings, flowers, and knitted hats. But the flowers withered in less than three days, and the hats unraveled on the children‚Äôs heads. Daniela fell sick early. She twisted under the full moon, eyes rolled back, thick drool hanging from her chin. Sometimes she stared at the ceiling, smiling with clenched teeth, as if someone invisible were whispering from above.  
She called them divine punishments. The bottle of anticonvulsants stayed sealed in a drawer, replaced by lukewarm holy water and thick smoke that smelled of burnt bone.

At night, the prayers crept up the stairs like a sticky tide while oil hissed on the stove. Through the crack in the door, I watched‚Äîmy mother crying without sound, her hands trembling, while *she* pressed her palms against Daniela‚Äôs forehead, lips moving in a language that should have stayed buried. Sometimes the child‚Äôs body arched, sometimes it went stiff‚Äîand even as a little girl, I knew that what moved in her didn‚Äôt come from heaven.

Then came the rules.  
Who ate first.  
What kind of oil was used for each body.  
Who could speak, and when.  
Diego, the other twin, didn‚Äôt stand up until she looked at him; Rub√©n, her husband and my uncle, waited for the nod of her head. She touched shoulders, corrected hands, distributed leftover food as if tuning an invisible instrument. ‚ÄúOrder,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúis the highest form of love.‚Äù  
But they lived in filth. Every empty jar, every lidless can, every plastic bag folded with a nun‚Äôs precision. Stained clothes, food slowly rotting inside the fridge‚Äôs compartments, bent spoons carrying the memory of old mouths. That floor of our house wasn‚Äôt clean, nor chaotic‚Äîjust a motionless balance, a tidy rot that smelled like confinement.

Animals began to avoid her. The cat no longer slept on her bed‚Äîhe hid under the furniture, whiskers singed, tail cut. The twins‚Äô puppy, Katy, peed herself every time *she* spoke, as if her voice carried an invisible electric charge. When she reached to pet my own puppy, my mother yanked me by the arm with dry force.  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let her touch him,‚Äù she whispered between her teeth.  
‚ÄúNot him. Not you.‚Äù  
And in that moment, I learned that fear also has a scent.

That night, every clock in the house stopped. Wall clocks, wristwatches, even the cuckoo in the dining room. Time refused to move the instant Daniela screamed. It wasn‚Äôt a sick child‚Äôs cry‚Äîit was the sound of a truth understood: the air itself rejected her.  
She ran through the corridors, rosary tangled in her hands. Prayers multiplied like flies over raw meat. My mother pushed me toward my room, but I still managed to peek through the crack: Daniela twisting on the bed, her body warped by her mother‚Äôs demonic faith. She rubbed hot oil on the child‚Äôs forehead‚Äîso hot it blistered the skin‚Äîand the smell of burned flesh merged with incense. In the dim light, my uncle Rub√©n wept silently, staring at his palms while Diego repeated the prayers in a mechanical voice.

After that night, Daniela stopped speaking. She walked with a rosary around her neck, always behind *her*, as if pulled by an invisible string. Her steps no longer made a sound, only the faint click of beads striking her skin. She went to bed before sunset, but her eyes stayed open, fixed on the door, waiting for something only she could hear.  
Diego, on the other hand, became her mirror. Obedient. Smiling. Eating in silence. Calm in the way fear learns to pretend. Even his shadow moved with delay, as though waiting for permission. He had learned to breathe only when *she* exhaled. The opposite of the possessed daughter‚Äîhe was *her* last hope for normalcy.

I don‚Äôt know when she began to notice me. Maybe when she realized I could still look at her without lowering my eyes. She started inviting me to her table, with the rest of her dead.  
One night, she offered me a glass of warm milk. A yellowish foam floated on top, like curdled fat.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôll make you strong.‚Äù  
I held it but didn‚Äôt drink. The smell was sour, like milk that had aged while waiting for someone foolish enough to be cared for. That was the first night I forced myself to vomit.  
And that night, I dreamed of a cord.  
It came out from Daniela‚Äôs chest and disappeared into her mother‚Äôs body. I tried to cut it, but the knife melted in my hand, and from the soft blade dripped warm milk that smelled like a womb.  
Then I heard her whisper in my ear:  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt break what binds us. There is no love purer than this.‚Äù

For a while, we thought she had surrendered‚Äîthat the thing haunting the house was stronger than her, and that her children were only victims of whatever consumed her. Convenient, wasn‚Äôt it?  
One day, they left. My mother and I rejoiced quietly because the house finally breathed again. The air stopped smelling of reheated oil, our shadows regained their shape. There were no midnight prayers, no spoiled milk, no plastic bags stacked in the kitchen corner. For the first time in years, we slept without feeling watched from the threshold.

Chapter 1 ‚Äî The Joke That Started It All:

¬†

Gloria in late December had the feeling of a country holding its breath. The skyline that once pulsed with traffic and laughter now looked bruised ‚Äî checkpoints at intersections, banners in another language, armored vehicles rolling slow like they were testing the patience of the whole city.

Sometimes, when I passed through the central boulevard, I still remembered how it used to sound ‚Äî vendors shouting over the hum of buses, the smell of roasted peanuts and rain-washed asphalt. Now the same street was silent except for the hum of engines and the occasional barked order through a megaphone.

Rain hadn‚Äôt fallen for weeks, but the air was heavy, as if the sky itself mourned.

I sat on the living-room couch with a closed engineering textbook on my knee. Civil engineering was my course; the drawings and formulas were what I came back to night after night because they were a map of future certainties. I had a plan, or wanted one ‚Äî to leave a name behind. Not a fleeting mark, but a legacy. I wanted to build something that would make the world remember me long after I was gone.

My cousin Raikou lay on the floor across from me. Two years younger, always quicker to laugh, always restless in a way that made me both proud and uneasy. He was flipping a coin ‚Äî the same tarnished coin he‚Äôd carried since childhood ‚Äî catching it with the same rhythm every time. He once said it brought him luck. Lately, I think he just liked having control over something that still obeyed his hand.

‚ÄúImagine not waking up here anymore,‚Äù he said without looking up. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ gone. A proper escape.‚Äù

He spoke quietly, but the sentence landed like a decision. The occupation had hardened into a daily reality ‚Äî public radio announcing curfews, foreign troops patrolling markets, and every small freedom measured against a new rule. Saying the word¬†leave¬†was no longer theater; it was survival.

I told him it was reckless. I told him the obvious things: the coast was watched, the borders were closed, the harbor was a line of metal teeth. But when Raikou fixed me with his usual impatient half-smile, I heard in his voice a resolve I couldn‚Äôt ignore.

‚ÄúWe either live our lives under someone else‚Äôs orders,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúor we find a way the occupiers didn‚Äôt expect.‚Äù

The laugh that rose between us was thin ‚Äî not humor, but defiance. The kind of laugh that acknowledges danger and chooses it anyway.

For weeks, the idea became a private code. We catalogued possibilities ‚Äî boats we might find, unguarded routes, familiar faces in the market who might help if we dared to ask. People said the ports were sealed. People lied for comfort. We listened and filed every contradiction like a list of exits.

One night in March, at a small internet caf√© run by Mr. Aymen ‚Äî a man who brewed coffee strong enough to mask despair ‚Äî Raikou and I sat beneath a flickering screen. The television looped the same images: barricades, foreign officers, the same city learning to speak less each day.

‚ÄúYou hear about the convoy?‚Äù Mr. Aymen muttered to a customer, too loudly for the room. ‚ÄúThey move at night now. They move like they own the dark.‚Äù

Raikou leaned closer. ‚ÄúThere are gaps,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúGaps that close, but only sometimes. A person who knows how to wait sees them.‚Äù

I nodded. Waiting, measuring, precision ‚Äî the tools of an engineer. And perhaps, of an escape.

By May, the idea had stopped being a joke. Raikou had been saving for weeks ‚Äî folded bills in an old tin, coins tucked in his shoes. He spoke less, smiled less. The restlessness in him had turned into direction.

One morning, I woke to find him already dressed, bag in hand. His coin rested on the table ‚Äî as if luck was no longer needed.

‚ÄúYou coming?‚Äù he asked.

No speech. No plea. Just the quiet certainty that if I said no, we would never meet again.

That night, the coast was a black line beneath a darker sky. Twelve faces met us there ‚Äî strangers with the same tired determination. A single patched boat waited, stripped of everything but purpose. There were no flags, no papers; only the resolve of those who refused to be counted.

I looked at the sea and felt how small we were. The water stretched out like an unspoken history, swallowing names too heavy to carry.

‚ÄúAre you afraid?‚Äù I asked Raikou.

He shrugged. ‚ÄúEverything we had is gone. This is the unwritten map.‚Äù

We stepped onto the boat together.

When the oars dipped into the water, the coast began to fade. The city shrank behind us, its dim lights trembling like memories that didn‚Äôt want to die. We had not chosen adventure. We had chosen necessity.

The motor growled, then softened to a hum. For hours, we drifted through darkness thick enough to erase direction. The air grew colder, metallic. Prayers filled the silence, whispered by lips that knew no more of faith than of geography.

Then, the engine began to choke.

The old guide ‚Äî a man whose name none of us ever learned ‚Äî raised a hand. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here,‚Äù he said.

No one spoke.

Fog rolled in, silver and slow, swallowing everything in reach. There was no coastline. No horizon. Only the sound of our breath and the lapping of water that felt too still, too deliberate.

Raikou leaned forward. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean‚Ä¶¬†here?‚Äù

The guide didn‚Äôt blink. ‚ÄúThe place you were meant to reach,‚Äù he said. His voice carried no emotion ‚Äî only finality.

He turned off the engine. The boat drifted.

The air smelled of iron and rain that never fell.

I felt the weight of my ambition then ‚Äî all the structures I had wanted to build, the name I hoped to leave behind ‚Äî and wondered if I had just stepped into a kind of history no one ever returns from.

Raikou met my gaze. ‚ÄúIs this‚Ä¶ the other side?‚Äù

Before I could answer, the fog moved ‚Äî not like mist, but like something alive, drawing itself apart.

And that‚Äôs when I realized:
We hadn‚Äôt escaped.
We had arrived somewhere that didn‚Äôt want to be found.",1,1760294869.0,Wattpad,1,1.0,False

I am trying to design my own Onewheel with reusable parts from my university and I have this issue where essentially if I ride this in a cold condition and immediately enter a room like a coffee shop where the air would be say warm right, internal condensation would occur within the enclosures, which could threaten the electronics, Im also trying to use the aluminum rails and connect it the the VESC controller to dissipate heat when riding because if wind makes contact with the rails, they have higher surface area which in turn if the Vesc could make direct contact via aluminum sheet could dissipate the heat as well, that being in turn creates even more risk. So far, to combat this, my research has basically shown that if I could regulate the internal pressure of the enclosure with the outside pressure, it should reduce internal condensation by a lot, so I found out about Gore-Tex Vents and connected that Onewheel's own vents use a similar membrane patch for their own vents, basically they can bring in large amounts of air while rejecting direct contact with water, but if it was to make continuous contact with water it can get clogged and eventually backfire, so one wheel places their patches against the rail however I can't do that for this build as I am using 2 square rails made up of aluminum T6-6061 Alloy that will house the enclosure and wheels in-between. I could probably mill out 1 entire side however the reason why I don't is because my enclosures are much larger due to the older battery I use ( I use a 12s3p Samsung battery from my older skateboard builds) Which is why cutting up one side being open like one wheel does in ineffective. In the photos I have a vent hole on the walls of the enclosure that face the wheel directly, this prevents direct contact with water outside and reduces pressure build up by airflow as well, now I can see how this becomes contradicting as the water (if I was ever to ride in the rain) could shoot up against these walls which would result in water build up, and not just that but other particles like dust, etc. Which is why in the second photo, there is a ""water shield"" I'd like to call it to prevent that as it just needs to equalize pressure with the outside, and then I added a 2nd form of protection but going deeper in the enclosure and giving a second wall with another Vent patch. So double protection with one of them being a water shield as well. I have drawn multiple scenarios and have studied the internals of the onewheel, I cannot see any other form of solutions however I always apprecaite critisim and suggestions as it can help me expand my view and fix other problems or think about future problems. I'd appreciate your advice or suggestion toward this ""condensation"" problem of mine and offer other suggestions on how to approach this project or what to add to prevent future problems.

If you need a scale: twenty days of up carved out by a single bar. Twenty. If that doesn‚Äôt reset your posture, you‚Äôre not trading, you‚Äôre gambling with borrowed luck.

Do yourself a favor this week: leave the storylines to the people who need them. Trump, China, Rare Earth, Aliens, whatever the media pins to the board to explain why you feel sick, they‚Äôre props.

Hi everyone, I was hoping to get some advice on how to talk to my friend about masking, as I am a very non-confrontational person but this is really eating at me. For a bit of background, my partner and I mask but I don‚Äôt have any other CC loved ones. My partner and I moved states earlier this year and my best friend (only friend really) also lives here so I have been hanging out with her more. Throughout the summer it was easier because we could do picnics so I felt safer being around a non masked person (even outdoors I am masked). She has had to cancel or decline several hang outs due to being sick, which I appreciate her doing that instead of potentially passing it to me. And each time I empathize cause being sick sucks and I care for her. I offer to drop off medicine, masks, food, vitamins etc but she always says no. And throughout each sickness she continues to work and go to restaurants unmasked. I really miss our old friendship, we used to be able to have sleepovers and dinner and drinks together. We used to completely agree about politics, but to her covid is ‚Äúover.‚Äù I tried to explain the dangers of covid, explain how this effects our community members and immunocompromised ppl especially babies who have no say in this, explain how more and more people are having cardiac arrest or POTS diagnosed etc but all she‚Äôll say is like ‚Äúyeah all those energy drinksüôÑ.‚Äù If we are having a text conversation and I mention covid, she will ignore my text for at least a week and then text me about something different. I just feel like we are in completely different worlds. This past weekend was her birthday and she invited me to an indoor event with an acquaintance I don‚Äôt really talk to anymore. I try to avoid indoor gatherings but since it was her birthday I agreed. I arrive and, guess what? They are BOTH sick, sipping off the same coffee together. Coughing, sneezing, sniffling the whole damn time. I wanted to leave and cry. Like, she KNOWS how much I value my health and to put me in a position like that made me so uncomfortable. I didnt wanna be a bad friend and leave immediately, but I did not stay long. I want to say something to her about it all but I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. Part of me feels like the friendship is over but I don‚Äôt want to lose this friend, she is a good person but her actions this past year have made me feel really gross, I want to be able to help her realize she should be wearing a mask but I dont know the right words to say",9,1760294677.0,ZeroCovidCommunity,8,0.8,False

1o4x3yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/1o4x3yj/started_welbutrin_and_omg/,Started Welbutrin and OMG,"I've resisted taking medication or have been denied medication my while life until recently when I started Welbutrin XL 150mg. Wow what a difference. Within a week I was no longer being overwhelmed with intense emotions and the clarity I've felt has been eye opening. Thats not to say the first few weeks weren't rough though. I made the mistake of having a coffee one afternoon which is not uncommon for me and I ended up staying up until 2am and ended up in a not so safe situation with a stranger down town (maybe that didn't have too much to do with the meds?) I know 150mg is not a large dose either and it's been about 6 weeks now since I started and I feel I've adjusted well.

I've worked out a little routine for myself where I wake up around 5:30-6 am (not common for me at all pre-butrin) take take my one pill. Go for a walk before sunrise which is so peaceful (first few weeks included many walking crying fits so the privacy was nice!), then come home eat breakfast a shower and I actually feel ready to tackle the day for the first time in a long while!

I'm curious if anyone here can relate or if I'm experiencing some kind of placebo effect. Also thinking about asking my Dr. about increasing my dose since the effects are starting to deminish.",1,1760294653.0,antidepressants,0,1.0,False

1o4x39j,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/1o4x39j/sharing_public_space/,Sharing public space,"I‚Äôve been working in the field over ten years. And learning more and more about myself, my interests, and my curiosity. 

While I don‚Äôt *participate* in ethical non-monogamy, on occasion, someone who does will want to work with me.  It‚Äôs also not a new area of clinical interest nor clinical experience and training. I‚Äôve obtained a few certifications in this domain. 

Additionally, I do have clinical support (group consultation peers) who are aware and do well to see multiple frames for this discussion. 

That said.  There is local kink scene/community that I‚Äôm finding to be supportive and friendly toward me and my partner who are monogamous in both sexual practice and emotional connection. 

The community leadership hosts a variety of Munch times throughout the month (including vanilla meals, coffee brunches, shibari and rigging classes (purely instruction) and game nights), kink safety educational instruction, as well as more private events. 

I‚Äôve been attending events on and off for over two years and our first private party was last month. Events range from local Munches to play parties nearly 75 miles away. However, I‚Äôve seen clients at street fairs as many as 65 miles away.  So I *knew* this situation might arise. 

Nobody that I am aware of, nor observed, has engaged in sexual behaviors outside of their primary or known partnerships. Though, of course, it *is* possible. Not something I‚Äôm interested in for myself. 

That said, it‚Äôs *possible* that a former client is also somewhat new to the community. We appear (I know‚Ä¶) to be of the same gender and are both partnered up. This individual has not approached me speculating how they might recognize me. And likewise, as I‚Äôm possibly their former clinician, I‚Äôve not done so either - we‚Äôve not had opportunity yet to be alone, nor have either of us initiated this.  If this individual *was* a client, I‚Äôd suspect less than 6 sessions. Definitely brief. Thus my brain rattling is not yielding much. Note: I know. Once a client, now a former client. And no. This is not romantic or sexual interest in the individual or their partner. Nor my partner in one of them. So any Codes of Ethics sections referenced by my association as well as my State (the same) seem to be devoid of mention regarding basic socialization / events / etc without the explicit involvement of sexual and/or or romantic nature. 

There are other communities in the 40-50mi distance range, but one of the primary play spaces hosts events for multiple communities and they‚Äôre often open to each other for attendance and participation.  So, it‚Äôs not like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs easy; find a different community to explore your identity,‚Äù is too much of a realistic option. Options so far include: 

1. I‚Äôve gotten feedback to ‚Äúif the possible former client doesn‚Äôt bring it up, it‚Äôs a non-issue‚Äù. That doesn‚Äôt seem completely accurate. We know much goes on in the mind even before words are spoken.

2. I‚Äôve gotten feedback of ‚Äúapproach the possible former client‚Äù when they and you aren‚Äôt with your respective partners and offer the ‚Äúyou look familiar; I‚Äôm wondering if we‚Äôve met before somewhere.‚Äù  Of course, they might say no and then, three hours later after engaging in a non-sexual kink scene with them and their partner, they realize, on the way home, and gasp aloud to their partner. 

3. I‚Äôve gotten feedback of ‚Äúsucks to be you.‚Äù  Possibly true. I dread this. I‚Äôm at a place in my life and marriage where we are both open to being curious and more comfortable with each other exploring that curiosity a bit. 

Along with the bonus of no more children at home with us so none of the ‚Äúwhat did you guys do to over the weekend?‚Äù being put to *us* or even the ‚Äúyou were out late.  No curfew?‚Äù that would *definitely* happen. 

5. I‚Äôve gotten feedback of ‚Äúguest list?‚Äù  Nope. Guest lists are hidden aside from the host and the Monitors. And to ask would raise questions. Especially since, only the Community Leader and Host know my identity.  And obviously, my partner.  Most of us use pseudonyms. I don‚Äôt even announce I‚Äôm going, or ask. Because others don‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm new. It‚Äôs not a thing. The folks who want to play together set things up privately and ahead of time. 

6. Other options I might be missing. 

I know I could have set this up as a poll. But it‚Äôs already weird enough. I don‚Äôt want to be weirder. 

 
So, r/ therapists. I‚Äôd love your thoughts. If dungeons and kink aren‚Äôt your thing, put ‚Äúmy thing‚Äù in instead and see what sticks. Please and thank you.

1o4x34d,https://www.reddit.com/r/qullamaggie/comments/1o4x34d/wall_street_radar_stocks_to_watch_next_week_vol_59/,üöÄ Wall Street Radar: Stocks to Watch Next Week - vol 59,"**After the Screenshot Parade**

Friday felt like a dare answered. All week (and also the one before), the timeline was a confetti cannon: record P&Ls, victory screenshots, everyone suddenly fluent in genius. Then the market did the rude thing it always keeps in its pocket.

One giant red candle, stocks and indexes, and crypto the same shade, billions erased in the time it takes to finish your coffee. Stairs up, elevator down. No apology, no lesson plan, just the drop.

Full article, updated Portfolio and Watchlist [HERE](https://www.gb.capital/p/wall-street-radar-stocks-to-watch-vol-59)

If you need a scale: twenty days of up carved out by a single bar. Twenty. If that doesn‚Äôt reset your posture, you‚Äôre not trading, you‚Äôre gambling with borrowed luck.

Do yourself a favor this week: leave the storylines to the people who need them. Trump, China, Rare Earth, Aliens, whatever the media pins to the board to explain why you feel sick, they‚Äôre props. Price is the plot. Follow it. Then wait. And wait. And wait some more. The urge to mash buttons is how red candles turn into red weeks. Use your head.

Anyone can push: professionals pause.

We‚Äôre early for shorts and late for hero longs. That‚Äôs the honest map. Utilities are the only sector with a clean halo: respectable, defensive, not exactly the soundtrack to a bull‚Äôs greatest hits album. We scan thousands of tickers a week; patterns usually hum before they sing. Right now, the hum is faint. A few biotechs show relative strength, enough to circle but not enough to bet the house.

We ended the week mostly in cash.¬†**BLDR**¬†is the last holdout, and even that might meet the exit door on Monday if it forgets why we‚Äôre in it. This isn‚Äôt cowardice. It‚Äôs a craft.

What mattered most was the boring thing: we managed risk like it pays our rent‚Äîbecause it does. We closed everything with profit, gave back only the imaginary kind they print on your screen to make you reckless. Maybe we underperformed the mania the last couple weeks. Fine. We‚Äôre still sitting at or near performance highs without donating sanity back to the house. Mental capital is a position. Guard it.

The gauges are not serenading us. T2118 sits at 8.72; if it dips under 5 this week, expect at least a dead‚Äëcat bounce, maybe better. It‚Äôs been sliding for thirty days straight. T2108 at 25.53 says there‚Äôs room to rot further. Mixed signals. Mixed signals breed bad decisions if you force answers out of them.

So here‚Äôs the gospel for the moment: brake lights on. Give it a week. Let the chart add color, let the tape show its next trick. Volatility is on the schedule; you don‚Äôt need a press release to know that.

There will be days that look like salvation and nights that taste like copper.

Stand down from the need to be first. Be right enough, late enough, with capital intact.",4,1760294601.0,qullamaggie,0,0.83,False

Friday felt like a dare answered. All week (and also the one before), the timeline was a confetti cannon: record P&Ls, victory screenshots, everyone suddenly fluent in genius. Then the market did the rude thing it always keeps in its pocket.

One giant red candle, stocks and indexes, and crypto the same shade, billions erased in the time it takes to finish your coffee. Stairs up, elevator down. No apology, no lesson plan, just the drop.

If you need a scale: twenty days of up carved out by a single bar. Twenty. If that doesn‚Äôt reset your posture, you‚Äôre not trading, you‚Äôre gambling with borrowed luck.

Do yourself a favor this week: leave the storylines to the people who need them. Trump, China, Rare Earth, Aliens, whatever the media pins to the board to explain why you feel sick, they‚Äôre props. Price is the plot. Follow it. Then wait. And wait. And wait some more. The urge to mash buttons is how red candles turn into red weeks. Use your head.

Anyone can push: professionals pause.

We‚Äôre early for shorts and late for hero longs. That‚Äôs the honest map. Utilities are the only sector with a clean halo: respectable, defensive, not exactly the soundtrack to a bull‚Äôs greatest hits album. We scan thousands of tickers a week; patterns usually hum before they sing. Right now, the hum is faint. A few biotechs show relative strength, enough to circle but not enough to bet the house.

We ended the week mostly in cash.¬†**BLDR**¬†is the last holdout, and even that might meet the exit door on Monday if it forgets why we‚Äôre in it. This isn‚Äôt cowardice. It‚Äôs a craft.

What mattered most was the boring thing: we managed risk like it pays our rent‚Äîbecause it does. We closed everything with profit, gave back only the imaginary kind they print on your screen to make you reckless. Maybe we underperformed the mania the last couple weeks. Fine. We‚Äôre still sitting at or near performance highs without donating sanity back to the house. Mental capital is a position. Guard it.

The gauges are not serenading us. T2118 sits at 8.72; if it dips under 5 this week, expect at least a dead‚Äëcat bounce, maybe better. It‚Äôs been sliding for thirty days straight. T2108 at 25.53 says there‚Äôs room to rot further. Mixed signals. Mixed signals breed bad decisions if you force answers out of them.

So here‚Äôs the gospel for the moment: brake lights on. Give it a week. Let the chart add color, let the tape show its next trick. Volatility is on the schedule; you don‚Äôt need a press release to know that.

There will be days that look like salvation and nights that taste like copper.

1o4x10i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1o4x10i/was_i_in_an_abusive_relationship_was_i_the_abuser/,Was I in an abusive relationship? Was I the abuser?,"Just came out of a 1.5 year relationship, and trying to wrap my head around things. My ex (33m) and I (32f) lived together for a year. He ended things and moved out last month. He says he felt abused and traumatized by me. That he felt he was taking on all the housework and that I was taking advantage of him being in a financially vulnerable situation. For context, he is an undocumented worker who was fired from the company that was going to sponsor him. He was fired 5 more times from cash jobs during our relationship. This put all the financial pressure on me, and I truthfully began to resent that. 

Now that we‚Äôve had some distance though, things aren‚Äôt really adding up. My friends and family tell me he was abusive. Of course, they are biased towards me so wanted some objective insight. Here are the things that came up during the relationship that I‚Äôm now seeing were concerning:

1. He was extremely financially irresponsible. When we met, he was earning $5K a month. He would still occasionally ask me to borrow $50 for Ubers and lunch. He would always pay it back, but would be offended if I expressed concern that he didn‚Äôt have $50. He was also late on his share of rent every month we lived together.

2. He had an explosive temper. He would shout at me, tell me in anger that I‚Äôm a horrible person, to get the fuck out of here, that he doesn‚Äôt love me. 

3. If I expressed feeling lonely or rejected or insecure, he would have explosive reactions where he would cry and punch himself in the face repeatedly until he bled.   

4. Towards the end, he began physically intimidating me. Getting within an inch of my face to shout, punching the bed right next to my head, taking my headphones off my head, swung a door at me and stopped it before it hit me, raised a fist to make me flinch, grabbed the back of my neck to pull me close.

5. Breaking promises. We recently moved into a new apartment. I fronted the whole deposit because he didn‚Äôt have the cash upfront. Half of it was a pet deposit , which he knew. I told him I cannot afford to sign the lease unless he gives me half the total deposit. He shook my hand and agreed - and then backtracked the next day and said he isn‚Äôt responsible for that because the dog is mine, not his. 

6. Broke up with me once for elbowing him accidentally in my sleep. He asked me to stop, I got up and moved to the couch because I was disturbing him, and he shouted at me about it for hours. He came back and tried to reconcile a few hours later, suggested we move to a bigger apartment and told me I should sponsor his immigration so he can afford to pay my student debt - I have never asked or expected him to pay my student debt that this felt sketchy and manipulative. 

7. Quit a job the week of my birthday and didn‚Äôt have anything else lined up. He spent that time off with his mom who was visiting from out of town. Due to him not working for 3 weeks while his mom was here, we had to cancel our pre-booked trip to visit my family or I had to cover the entire cost myself (which is what I ultimately did).

8. Yelled at me on my birthday. When we got home I said I felt sad we hadn‚Äôt had sex in a while and felt lonely. He exploded, hit objects and himself and yelled at me until 5AM when I had to be up for work the next morning.

9. Rejected me every time I tried to initiate sex, and told me I was imagining things when I said he made me feel unattractive. He did verbally compliment my looks often - and I am conventionally attractive. But he would always reject me, or be too tired, or complain about something with my body (ex. My pubic hair was too spiky and hurting him) that would cause us to stop mid-way. We would go long periods without sex, he would choose to watch porn instead , and then tell me I‚Äôm insecure and imagining things when I raised this with him. 

10. Told me I didn‚Äôt contribute to the housework and that I ‚Äúdid nothing‚Äù . He says he is the only one who does dishes - which is simply untrue. I cooked literally all our meals at home. He did sweep and take out the garbage more than I did. But frankly, the house has been way cleaner since he moved out.  He made me feel dirty and lazy, but really he wasn‚Äôt slaving away at housework the way eh constantly said he was. 

11. Lashed out at me every time I expressed concern about his financial situation. He would tell me that he doesn‚Äôt have $5 to grab coffee from the grocery store. I would tell him hey I will grab it myself but it is really scary that you don‚Äôt even have $5. He would yell at me and call me cruel and unsupportive and that I shouldn‚Äôt expect him to pay for everything. 

Rationally I know these things are unacceptable. But ultimately, he is the one who left me, so I must have done something wrong. 

The day he broke up with me I did say many cruel things to him. He asked me to help him with the cleaning when I got back from work. I had meal prepped for us the previous night and I told him I expect him to do more housework when he‚Äôs not working. He started yelling and I just snapped. I called him a loser, said he has nothing to offer and blames everyone else for the problems in his life instead of taking accountability. I called him an abuser like his deceased father. He then became physically aggressive - but didn‚Äôt hit me, and then broke up with me. 

He tells me he felt unseen and unheard and abused. I apologized and begged to reconcile and he told me he wants no contact with me. He told me I only want him because I feel I can‚Äôt do better, and that he feels afraid he will physically hurt me if he stays. 

Of course, I can see now that the relationship was very unhealthy and needed to end. But was it my fault? Is there something I‚Äôm not seeing here? Was I abusive? Was I being gaslit? Or was this just a mutually toxic situation?",6,1760294465.0,TwoXChromosomes,18,0.8,False

1o4wy2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarnivalCruiseFans/comments/1o4wy2h/pregnant_cruising_carnival_breeze_10225/,Pregnant cruising! Carnival Breeze 10/2/25,"Husband and I are annual cruisers every autumn out of Galveston, and this year's vacation lined up perfectly with my 23rd week of pregnancy with our first baby! A quick 4 day to and from Cozumel was an awesome babymoon for us. I did a lot of online research before we got on, hopefully my experience will help future moms-to-be!

**Boarding -** I wanted to be completely ready for any questions, so I did get a letter from my OB saying ""she's good to cruise, she's not due until end of Jan, won't even touch 24 weeks""... And nobody asked about it once. Maybe it was cheating to hide my belly, but I was in a wrap dress for comfort, and no one even looked at me twice. Have it ready and printed with your passport juuuuuuust in case, but don't offer it if they don't ask.

**Casino** \- We spend a lot of time gambling most cruises, and were kind of bummed we'd be mostly avoiding the main casino on the 5th floor because of all the smokers... but the 4th floor non-smoking casino was still a ton of fun! Tables were obviously more limited due to size, but the Fun-21 and Blackjack tables still had a good bit of space for us intermittently! Sometimes we played together, sometimes Husband hit the table while I took some time with the slots, but the energy was still great! Plus the bar was showing all the football games, which was perfect when the tables went cold on us and we needed a break.

**Drink Package** \- After doing the math, we decided it still made sense for us to do the full drink package in terms of cost! Husband had his mojitos and beers by the pool while I went with zero-proof/""virgin"" mojitos to stay cool in the sun, and we each went through at LEAST 6 a day out on the water. Then there were the coffees, Powerades, and extra water bottles, it still cost less to get that package and enjoy all the non-alcoholic offerings!

**Spa/Salon** \- As suggested by previous cruisers, I swung by the spa on day 1 just before the Sail Away Party to ask about what options were available to me with these particular technicians on board. I was told that for massages, only the Swedish massage would be an option to me, and that's what I was hoping for anyways! I booked at 75 minute for the Cozumel port day (save money! avoid walking on the port! all good things!) and got to relax with some muscle-releasing oils they have for tense muscles. The table did not have any sort of hole for round bellies, so you'll be on your side, and there wasn't a support pillow for your leg. If your back struggles, this might not be as helpful as you want, but I felt pretty good afterward. I also did a blowout appointment in the salon for formal night, and while my hair looked fantastic afterward, those chairs and leaning back into the bowl was super uncomfortable. I toughed it out, but if I did it again I would have asked for a back pillow or rolled up towel for a smidge of extra support.

**Debarking** \- CHECK YOUR LUGGAGE. The second that notification for time slots hit my app, I booked the earliest one at 8:30am and set to pick up our luggage at the port on our way out. We always drive in (TX locals) and like to get home by early afternoon when we can help it, but I know I would have struggled with my suitcase and waiting for elevators. In fact, I struggled with it getting on, and learned my lesson. We packed everything other than PJs, morning toiletries, documents, and debark-day clothes in our checked suitcases. Everything else went in an extra duffle I usually bring for extra stuff/lightening the suitcases, topped with my pillow. When I tell you we were in our room at 8:20 to off the ship at 8:30, there's no exaggeration! It was SO fast and smooth.

**Misc. that made my cruise better** \-

* Brought my own Stanley-size empty cup that I filled on the Lido deck a couple times a day - it came with me EVERYWHERE
* Brought my own neck pillow, but used the 2 room-supplied pillows as back/leg support at night - I was NOT bringing my massive Momcozy pillow on this ship, this still did a great job and kept me comfortable/rested
* Booked a room halfway between our favorite places - if elevators are busy, but you know you can handle 3 flights of stairs down or 2 flights up, it will save time and frustration! For us, we booked on floor 7, right between Lido on 10 and Casino on 4, so we always had elevators at least coming through as other people went to the same places. I would have had a much harder time with a room on level 1 for example.
* Always know where the nearest bathroom is - these ships can be a MAZE, and when you stand and suddenly realize you have 20oz of water in you is not the time to hope someone else knows the answer
* Recognized my limits - this is the HARDEST one, but don't be afraid to sit with your feet up for a while, get help from your partner/roomie to lift your bag, to take a nap, to go to your room at 9:30pm and just enjoy a snack and in-room movie. Your days are better when you take care of yourself

Feel free to ask any questions you have, hope this helps some of y'all!",3,1760294281.0,CarnivalCruiseFans,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†**red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†**track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes**¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†**red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†**track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes**¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1o4wvqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1o4wvqt/not_ready_but_insane_chemistry/,Not ready but insane chemistry,"Apologies in advance this is a long one‚Ä¶

I met a guy about a year and a half ago, at his sibling / my friend‚Äôs bday party. We spent 90% of the evening talking to each other but he had a girlfriend at the time, who was also there and I spoke to a bit. I liked him instantly and felt a strong connection, but I respected the fact that he was in a long term relationship and didn‚Äôt really think of it much further. A few months later, in October 2024, we saw each other again at another bday party and it was the same deal, we spent all night speaking and it felt so easy and natural. But we kept it friendly and nothing flirty was said. Fast forward to this summer and his sister told me that he had broken up with his gf back in March. She suggested I reach out to him as I had also been through a long term relationship break up not that long ago (just before I met him) and we had both broken up with our partners for similar reasons. 

So I messaged him for the first time and we have been speaking ever since, about 10 weeks now. We speak most days, usually in the morning before work or in the evening. We have spoken on the phone a few times and the conversations lasted around 2 hours. At the start I initiated texts more often but since I noticed this I pulled back a little bit and he now initiates as much as me. 

I lightly flirted with him via text a couple of times and he went along with it / reciprocated until I joked about sharing a bed and he let me know that his head is still pretty scrambled from the breakup and he‚Äôs not really in the right headspace for that kind of thing right now. I accepted what he said and we moved on and conversation went back to normal. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago and his sister I mentioned before was having another bday party (1 year after me and him last saw each other in person). He lives about 4 hours away from me and we both live 2 hours away from the sister / my friend. He suggested that we meet up earlier on the day of her party to hang out. So he suggests 11am when the party isn‚Äôt until 7:30. We meet up and do some things he suggested like go to the museum, get a coffee and cake, walk along the river etc. Everything is friendly but I feel an undercurrent of tension between us. There is some intense eye contact and I can just feel a kind of mutual chemistry. 

We head to the party together and although we‚Äôve already spent all day together he suggests we go sit outside in the garden together. He buys me a drink and bought everything else we had together that day even though I offer / insist each time. We sit outside together right next to one another with our legs and arms touching. We have friendly conversation but the tension is building. After a little while there is a long pause in the conversation of us just looking quite intensely into each others eyes. I think that we are about to kiss and then he breaks the silence and says ‚ÄúI think if we were going to kiss now would be the time that it would happen‚Ä¶. *long pause* but I am not sure that I want that‚Äù he then proceeds to explain that he still has a lot of guilt over his breakup with his ex (they were together 12 years, since teenagers - he broke up with her) and that he thinks he would feel bad if something were to happen with me as we met when he was still with her. He also says that he did feel chemistry from the moment we first met, that he thought about me a lot after we first met, and that he is attracted to me. But that he cannot feel romantic feelings for me or anyone right now and he doesn‚Äôt really know why and has been considering therapy to help process it all. He also said that when I first messaged him he was really happy to see my message but equally felt conflicted and guilty for feeling that way. That it meant he had to start really grieving his relationship as he couldn‚Äôt get back together with her if he felt this way and started talking to me. But after all of this he then said he thinks I like him more than he likes me (I hadn‚Äôt really said anything much I was just listening and saying I understood) and he just wants to be friends and he doesn‚Äôt want to say if he will ever feel differently because he just doesn‚Äôt know right now. I said that I am not sure if it‚Äôs that I like him more or that we are just in different headspaces and stages of processing our respective breakups. 

After the conversation ended he asked if I was still comfortable being friends or wanted to take space, but told me it would be a big loss if we didn‚Äôt speak anymore however he would respect whatever I wanted or needed to do. I told him I would think about it. We then went back to the party group and danced together the whole night. We went back to his sisters place together and ended up sharing a bed, partly out of necessity partly because neither of us wanted to make it awkward by insisting on blowing up the airbed I guess? He made a couple of jokes that hinted about a video I had sent him and what I was wearing in it which was slightly suggestive. We laid next to each other and had another moment of staring into each others eyes, again I thought we might kiss. But he interrupted the silence by saying it was time to go to sleep. 

The next morning I was laying facing him and he was on his back. He was dozing and kind of woke up and turned over to face me with his eyes closed and shuffled closer until our foreheads were touching and I could feel him breathing quickly on my face. His eyes stayed closed but his eyes were blinking so I feel like he knew what he was doing. Neither of us moved and he eventually seemed to drift back off to sleep like that. About 20 mins later he woke up again and smiled and turned back onto his back. We continued to doze next to each other for a bit and at one point I asked if he was ok if I put my arm over him (I sleep on my stomach) and he said yes. Eventually we wake up properly and just look at things on his phone / listen to music in bed. We only get up around 11am because his brother is coming over to go out for breakfast. We all go for breakfast together and then I ask if it‚Äôs cool if we get the bus to the train station together, despite us needing to go to diff stations about 15 mins apart. He says yes and on the bus we sit next to each other but he makes more of an effort it seems to not let our legs touch. On the bus I ask how he‚Äôs feeling about things and he said that he liked sharing a bed, it felt nice, but he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea for us to do that again. I respect what he says and say it is up to him. 

We go our respective ways home and since this happened a week ago we have continued to message every day in a friendly way. His first message after we got home said he‚Äôd like to remain friends but doesn‚Äôt want to demand anything of me so would understand and respect if I needed space. I have invited him to a party I am having in a month and he said he will come.

I guess what I am wondering is what is going on here. On the one hand we seem pulled together and the chemistry is electric and everyone around us noticed it and he acknowledged it verbally. But on the other hand he said he is not in the headspace to act on it and wound feel guilt if he did. My friends having given me conflicting advice ranging from ‚Äúyou should have just kissed him‚Äù to ‚Äúcut him off!‚Äù lol. I don‚Äôt think I will follow either of those but I am a bit stuck. I genuinely really like him as a friend and I have not felt this level of chemistry with anyone in years. We have similar values, interests and get on so well. I don‚Äôt want to just throw away the opportunity of it being something more if there is a chance he might feel more ready when he has had time to process his breakup which only happened 7 months ago. I also don‚Äôt want to seem desperate or put pressure on him though. Do I pull back more? Take space? Just see how it goes? Is there a chance we could work out when he is ready? I know it is a thing people often say when they mean not ready with ‚Äòyou‚Äô but I do think he is genuinely processing a lot. He has not dated at all since they broke up and I doubt ever dated anyone before her given they got together as teens.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†**red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†**track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes**¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

i used to LOVE drinking coffee. i‚Äôd have at least one cup a day, if not more. when my pots started, i started to notice i would feel sick when i drank coffee. 

when i got my diagnosis, my cardiologist told me to stop drinking coffee because it was too much caffeine. i listened for about a year, until i had a 5 hour car ride across my state one christmas at 4 am to make it home on time. i stopped and got a coffee from starbucks, and within 30 minutes i had to pull over because i was having extreme chest pain and thought i was having a heart attack.

my cardiologist told me it was from the caffeine. after that, i stopped drinking it altogether. it‚Äôs now been 3 years and i‚Äôm having my first cup. my POTS symptoms have slowly begun getting better over the past few months, so i‚Äôm hoping this won‚Äôt set me back at all.

i‚Äôm in school to become a teacher, so i‚Äôll have my own classroom starting this spring. i love my job (i‚Äôm student teaching full time right now) and think having some sort of caffeine in the morning would help.

It would make it much easier for me to just drop it all off with them and let them move it but I also understand this will cost them time and space which is $.

1o4wpt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o4wpt8/diner_stories_2/,Diner Stories: 2,"I‚Äôd originally started this job with someone special to me. So in a way, the diner‚Äôs always held a part of my life in its fucked up little fingers. 

We were both in our senior year of high school, and we‚Äôd always heard stories of the place‚Äî not good stories, but still, we thought it was cool. 

Our plan was to work here through our senior year and save up enough for a van. We wanted to leave and explore the country, but obviously, that never really happened. I mean, we did get the van and all, but some stuff ended up happening and we never left. Or, well, *I* never left, *he‚Äôs* gone now, and I live behind this shitty ass diner we agreed to work at. 

The first time I experienced something weird, it wasn‚Äôt the sign dancer, screaming jukebox, or even the bathroom hot dog. Instead, it was something else that left me thinking I was tripping balls. 

This was back when I was still working part-time, and Tristian Hunt was the only full timer there.

I‚Äôd gone into the back to get some patties from the freezer, for some reason (probably to restock the ones we had up front, but I can‚Äôt remember the exact details). And I was reaching for some of the ones in the back, when I‚Äôd noticed some spider webs near the pickles. It was weird, but it wasn‚Äôt really all that bad. So, I forgot about it. Then, I think it was a few days after that I‚Äôd gone in there for something else and walked into one. Tristan came up while I was trying to get the shit out of my hair and asked what I was doing. He laughed when I told him and poked jokes at me being on Xanax or shit and seeing spiders.

He was kind of a miserable asshole. 

At one point, he was happily married to Mrs. Newman (a little shrew of a lady who now runs the local laundromat), and they had three daughters. 

Before the diner, Tristan had his own butcher shop. He‚Äôd dress out any deer you brought him during hunting season, and his homemade beef jerky was probably the best in this town. (I remember walking in with my dad when I was little and seeing his daughter, Miranda behind the register. I thought it was neat that she had a job at her age. I didn‚Äôt exactly realize she wasn‚Äôt doing it because she wanted to.) Tristan had his girls run the place with him so he didn‚Äôt have to pay for workers. It was an attempt to save money, and keep the place afloat. But it wasn‚Äôt quite enough, and the business went under after only a few years. When that happened, it was like every ounce of joy left the guy, and he started drinking pretty heavily. 
His wife left not too long after that. The rumor was he stopped bathing, and that was the final straw for her. She took the kids and left to live with a young Hispanic guy in the next town over. 
 
Sometimes, I‚Äôd find Tristan passed out in the mop station with shot bottles of Fireball and Makers Mark around him. He‚Äôd shit in the women‚Äôs bathroom when the men‚Äôs was occupied and wouldn‚Äôt flush because it was ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs work for a women‚Äôs room.‚Äù And he‚Äôd snub his cigarettes out in the Christmas lights when he thought no one was looking. Like I said, the guy was an asshole.

 But, in a weird sense, I kind of miss him. 

On the rare occasion he wasn‚Äôt being a dick, he would save an extra cup of coffee for me. It was always cold, and tasted like dirt, but I always drank it when he gave it to me. It was like the diner‚Äôs own little sign of good luck, because whenever I got it, my shift went smoothly, and the day usually ended pretty good.  

It took me finding a dead rat between tubs of Superman ice cream for him to believe me about the spiders, though.

The freezer had been smelling like ass for a while, and I had kinda accepted that it was like just that. But when I went in and grabbed some ice cream for the front, I ended up finding the source of the stench. Because there, hidden behind the gallon of multicolored frozen milk I‚Äôd just grabbed, was a very dead, very decayed, rat.

I remember how it looked so vividly‚Äîprobably because it was the most normal thing about what happened‚Äî it still had its fur, but there was a brownish liquid surrounding it. And instead of eyes, it had these yellow, fuzzy things‚Äì like the center of a daisy, it looked like that, but not on a flower. I had thought it was a mold or a mushroom or something, because mushrooms start out kinda looking like that. (Little bumpy clusters, then they get big, and you can eat them.)

I delivered the ice cream to its destination and came back with a dust pan for the rat. 
It was normal for the first split second after I‚Äôd scooped it up, then all hell broke loose. 
Hundreds of little, yellow spiders broke from their tightly clustered formation and flooded out of the rat from its empty sockets. I threw the rat, pan, and all, across the freezer. 
 And I‚Äôm pretty sure I walked to the front, but my memory gets kinda spotty after the spiders. All I remember is that I was making my way out, then I was sitting down in one of the booths with a half melted ice cube in my left hand. 
Tristan, who was in the lobby when I‚Äôd gone to deal with the ice cream and the rat, was in the freezer killing the spiders with an old fly swatter he‚Äôd gotten from God knows where. I remember faintly hearing him cursing up a storm with the occasional splaping sound interrupting him. 

He never made a Xanax or spider dig at me again after that. Come to think of it, I don‚Äôt think he ever even called me crazy again. 

Actually, scratch that. I overheard a conversation he had with Charlene Kurnaz, that one time. He‚Äôd told her that I‚Äôd ‚Äúcatered to someone who wasn‚Äôt there.‚Äù Which, I‚Äôve gotta say, wasn‚Äôt exactly my fault. But in his defense, it was the one time I can, in full confidence, say I was a bit off my rocker. 

This was a little bit after *he* had left, and I was still trying to get used to (what would be) my new normal. So I wasn‚Äôt really getting the best sleep, and I guess that, coupled with the stress of everything else that was going on in my life at that time, had caused me to start seeing ‚Äúfalse customers.‚Äù 

I swear, they looked just like normal people though. The only thing giving them away was their faces and hands. 
Sometimes they had no teeth, or an odd number of fingers. Their eyes would be just a little too big and everything else was droopy. I remember this one time, it was so bad‚Äî it almost looked like they were in the beginning process of being melted, like wax on a birthday candle. I‚Äôm pretty sure that was also the one that had stretched out ring and middle fingers. I can‚Äôt remember if it actually ordered anything, or if it just stood in the corner. That would also happen sometimes, but I don‚Äôt think Tristan ever knew. If they didn‚Äôt come up to order anything, they‚Äôd go to the nearest corner of the diner and stand there for hours.

I didn‚Äôt want to be rude, so when they did order, I‚Äôd serve them what they wanted. But my politeness was my downfall, because it made it a hell of a lot harder for people to believe me at the end of the day, when all was said and done. 

Thankfully, I don‚Äôt really see them all that much anymore. It‚Äôs just when I don‚Äôt get enough sleep, but even then, they‚Äôre just at the corner of my vision, muttering to themselves. It‚Äôs uncomfortable, but at least I know that they aren‚Äôt really real. 

When things *are* real, though, it‚Äôs like a blessing and a curse. Because on one hand, it‚Äôs nice to know my brain isn‚Äôt completely fucked, but on the other, there‚Äôs the off chance that I‚Äôll have to deal with whatever‚Äôs in front of me. Like all of those doll heads that started showing up. 

They got to be a real issue, and at first, I‚Äôd thought it was the religious group that was leaving them all over the place. It wouldn‚Äôt have been the first time they‚Äôd tried something like this. That‚Äôs how we ended up with Tomila, after all. 

It started small, like a plastic bag with two or three of them sitting at the back door. Then it started to escalate. I‚Äôd find them stapled to trees or in the grease trap under the grill. At one point, I walked into the freezer and found them arranged in a circle around a bag of hamburger buns on the floor. It was weirdly shrine-like. I mean, there were candles and everything. I wasn‚Äôt even aware we had candles. But lo and behold, there they were, and I had to clean that shit up, melted wax and all. 

I started giving the heads out as a sort of ‚Äúkids meal toy,‚Äù after they started piling up. The customers weren‚Äôt too thrilled, but the owners seemed to like the idea. 

Still not sure on who‚Äôs leaving them, though. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs Kurt, but after the shitstorm that happened this week, I‚Äôm not so sure.

He‚Äôs been here for almost four months, and every conversation with him has been short and stilted. So I didn‚Äôt really know if he was doing it or not. You see, I thought he was chill with the diner‚Äôs weirdness. But as it turns out, he‚Äôs either been blissfully unaware or really good at ignoring things.

I‚Äôd been in the middle of an‚Ä¶interesting conversation with Everett Gunnar about whether or not modern pesticides were causing people to become libertarians, when Kurt came up and got me. He‚Äôd been pretty shaken up about something, but wouldn‚Äôt tell me what it was until I followed him into the back. 
So, I turned and told Hershel to man the front while I figured out what was up. Only to find his mangled corpse not five seconds later. 

It was splayed out on the floor, broken bones leaving the skin looking weirdly stretched, clear fluid flowing out its nose, empty eyes staring at nothing, shit filled pants‚Äî the whole shebang. The thing was the pinnacle of a dead body, and from the open door to the mop next to it, it was clear it had fallen out of the broom closet.

Kurt was looking at me like he was trying to reach my soul via desperate telepathy, and I got the distinct feeling he was expecting something. I wasn‚Äôt about to admit to anything, though. So, we just sat there staring at each other like idiots for a few minutes, until he decided to crack. 

‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶is this real?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù 

Would it have been nicer if I‚Äôd lied? Probably. But I like to think I‚Äôve learned a thing or two from my previous mistakes, so I went with honesty. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw a speed-run of the five stages of grief happen on his face, as he stared at the corpse in front of us.

‚ÄúDo you know what happened?‚Äù His eyes had a distant look to them, as he asked me this. 

It‚Äôs always a bit weird to watch a person hit their limit. Every time it happens, a part of me wonders when I‚Äôll get there, when this job‚Äôll get to be too much, and I‚Äôll finally leave. (I know it probably wont happen. Even if I completely lose it, I‚Äôll probably keep working here.)

‚ÄúI hit him with the van when I was pulling into the parking lot earlier.‚Äù 

‚Äú‚Ä¶What?‚Äù He was looking at me now, eyes wide and body tense, like a rabbit getting ready to run. I knew my next words had to be careful. So I tried to reassure him.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, I was uncomfortable my first time too. As long as the one upfront doesn‚Äôt see it, we‚Äôll be okay.‚Äù

(I don‚Äôt actually know what‚Äôll happen if Hershel sees his own corpse, but I get the feeling that if he did, it wouldn‚Äôt be any good. That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not at least a little curious, though. Like, would he freak out? Try to kill me? Melt? It‚Äôs only been a few weeks, but sometimes, I catch my self *wanting* him to find it, just to see. I mean, it‚Äôs not like it would be a major loss. He doesn‚Äôt actually work here. He just walked in  and started flipping burgers‚Ä¶ Wow! That got morbid quick. Sorry.)

It took us a bit to get the body back into the closet again, and despite my assurances, Kurt still didn‚Äôt seem too keen on helping. (If I didn‚Äôt know any better, I‚Äôd say he didn‚Äôt want to touch it.) It stayed in the closet, up until five o‚Äôclock that evening, when Brennan Stringer came by to pick it up in our usual dealing. 

Since he been made more aware of the shit happening here, Kurt‚Äôs been acting a bit more‚Ä¶lively? I think that‚Äôs the word I‚Äôm looking for, at least. Anyhow, he‚Äôs been more open to conversation lately, and I‚Äôm starting to worry it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs thinking of quitting. Which sucks, because ever since Tristian went missing, the diner‚Äôs had a pretty inconsistent employment rate. The longest an employee stuck around was maybe three weeks. Granted, most of them were hitchhikers or from the woods. (Sometimes, they were both.) And they weren‚Äôt exactly the most reliable to begin with, but it still kinda stung every time they left.

While I can‚Äôt say for sure that Kurt didn‚Äôt come from the woods, (I‚Äôm not a hundred percent sure where the owners found him. But ever since our last group of new hires were lost to that fog from the woods, they‚Äôve started branching out from the usual crowd.) I‚Äôd really thought that, since he wasn‚Äôt like the others, maybe he‚Äôd be different. It not like he‚Äôs left yet, though.

So, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got for now. I‚Äôm gonna head out of the parking lot, and start making my way back in. My break‚Äôs almost over, and it looks like that game warden is back to ask about those deer. So, I guess this is where I‚Äôll leave y‚Äôall.

( From a Non-Fan),"So I know there‚Äôs a lot of discourse around swift right now. A lot of haters, a lot of apologizers but having watched and analyzed from afar for years I thought I would just share the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind some of what‚Äôs going on.

In short Taylor‚Äôs brand essentially is this: Her fans perceived her as this All American girl, ‚Äúthat friend from highschool‚Äù who outwardly seems pretty cutter but actually has those extra layers, actually kinda weird, kinda akward kinda anti social and has more depth than you would think for a high schooler.

This blend of normie meets, tormented artist has been the sort of avatar of how many highschool women have viewed themselves. 

So Taylor while conventionally pretty sort of self sabotages with her own ‚Äúweirdness‚Äù and hyper insecurity that is the X factor of Swift, that dark spot, that shadow that ‚ÄúTortured poet.‚Äù

So for her to come out and suddenly sing a happy Jackson 5 jingle about how a man rescued her from death and how she‚Äôs just so happy her new jock boyfriend has a giant cock, and how her haters can just go die- I think is like watching you‚Äôre close highschool friend , the cool arty introvert suddenly hit popular status and ditch you for the A Crowd. No more underdog, no more longing, no more taking the long route Becuase life won‚Äôt give you what you want. Just someone falling into what they want and no longer caring about your plight of life‚Äôs journey.

Or similarly like a friend who you realize has joined an MLM and instead of just grabbing coffee, you realize she wants to sell you time shares.

It‚Äôs a feeling of betrayal and that‚Äôs how her fans now feel.

So in a nutshell that‚Äôs essentially what‚Äôs going on with her and her fans.",0,1760293735.0,Music,6,0.34,False
1o4wovx,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1o4wovx/something_minor_in_regards_to_language_am_i_crazy/,Something minor in regards to language am I crazy,"I just got into it with a trans woman because I was barely reading a post they wrote about transmisogny and didn't know if they were a trans woman or speaking on their behalf so I used they. It caused conflict presumably because she feels defensive and backed into a corner. People besides me were asking for examples and proof but I got the attention for doing the same. 

I'm tired and cynical about so much stuff in the community. If you want to lie and drag people through the mud but hide behind anti trans or biphobia you are given license to. That scares me. It's acceptable to say ""I'm throwing out accusations that get groups and people shunned but how dare you ask for proof I don't have to provide any."" 

Regardless my actual question is does anyone else remember being told not to use the same pronoun over and over? Like I, me, he, she. That to not be redundant you use they or the person's name. And that applies even to trans women. Meaning that they is every humans pronoun onto of whatever other they have. 

Example: A woman, all dolled up and lovely, sat in the coffee shop sipping her coffee. A trans flag was pinned on her shirt. I sat idly, bored and I wondered what was going through their head. 

Am I crazy? Is that not how speaking works? Is this something I'll constantly butt heads with trans people with? 

Because it's not something I can easily change or feel the need to. It's what allowed me to be open to non-binary people and I've used it for cis men and women. I'm literally treating trans people the same I'm treating cis people where I mostly use the she/her he/him and only occasionally use they so speech flows better. 

I feel like no one else understands what I'm talking about. The online queer community is tiring and I tend to lurk because of the socially acceptable anti gay men homophobia in queer spaces. I'm in defensive mode myself. I don't know if I'm unreasonable or not. ",0,1760293701.0,asktransgender,17,0.33,False

1o4wlmx,https://youtube.com/watch?v=azhPj6XhS2Q&si=2Ae2EACbEOrAjMGC,Waiting For Him To Die,"A man on a screen, a bluster of orange and spite.
I am a Canadian, watching from the cold night.
My hate is not political, it's personal and deep.
It's for the rot he celebrates, the promises he doesn't keep.
This waiting is a silent scream into a void.
For the day the news alert says the world is destroyed.
Not in fire, but in quiet, when that final breath is drawn.
And the weight of his presence from the collective mind is gone.

And I am waiting for him to die.
Just waiting for him to die.
It's a passive, patient, private hope beneath this northern sky.
Waiting for him to die.

And I am waiting, too. Clasping my skeletal hands with delight.
His name is a bright, gaudy jewel in my gathering night.
I have a special, tasteless joke prepared for his arrival.
His legacy will be the fuel for my revival.

My boy, my beautiful mistake, with needle-tracked arms.
Charming the social workers, ignoring all the alarms.
He's been fifteen for nine years, milking the system dry.
The streetlights are his sun, and the alley is his sky.
We've tried the cops, the therapists, the threats, the desperate pleas.
Now we just wait for the phone call brought on by his disease.
The love is still there, but it's buried under dread.
Waiting for the final chapter of the story he's misread.

And we are waiting for him to die.
Just waiting for him to die.
It's a shameful, sacred, family secret we can no longer hide.
Waiting for him to die.

And I am waiting, too. I am the cold park bench where he'll finally rest.
I am the final, perfect high that will put him to the test.
He thinks he knows me from his chemical escapes.
But I am the permanent stillness that every addict shapes.

The intimidating giant of my youth is now a ghost.
A ninety-five-pound whisper, the man I feared the most.
A stroke erased the anger, left a gentle, fading man.
I bring him coffee, read him stories, and I hold his trembling hand.
It's a strange reconciliation in this sterile, bright-lit room.
Watching him linger in the gathering gloom.
My brother and I, we meet here every Sunday, and we sigh.
This waiting is an act of love, waiting for him to die.

And we are waiting for him to die.
Just waiting for him to die.
It's a tender, tired, merciful end to a complicated tie.
Waiting for him to die.

And I am waiting, too. I am the kindest nurse who will turn out the light.
I am the quiet peace that ends his endless night.
He glimpses me already in his clouded, fading mind.
I am the forgiveness he could never quite find.

And then I see the mirror, and the man who's standing there.
Fifty-two, with thinning hair and a well-practiced stare.
A thousand resumes sent, a thousand silent nos.
Supported by my mother and a love that's lukewarm at its close.
My children are polite strangers, my confidence is shot.
I've often thought of leaving a note: 'It had its moments,' was the thought.
This body is a rented room that's falling to decay.
And I'm the one I'm waiting for, to take myself away.

And I am waiting for me to die.
Just waiting for me to die.
Is there a great party in the afterlife, a more thrilling high?
I'm waiting for him to die.

And I am waiting, too. I am the employer who will finally hire.
I am the end of every failed and forgotten desire.
Your clever, morbid note is already written in my book.
Take as long as you need. Come, see the party that you forsook.

Waiting...
Waiting for him to die.
(Him, him, him... me)
The president, the son, the father, and the I.
Just... waiting.",1,1760293497.0,u_jatygu,0,1.0,False

1o4wjs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1o4wjs9/i_accidentally_became_the_office_coffee_cult/,I accidentally became the office coffee cult leader,"So I work in a pretty normal office. Cubicles, endless emails, passive-aggressive fridge notes the usual. About six months ago, the breakroom Keurig gave up on life, and our boss (who is more of a ‚ÄúDiet Coke at 9am‚Äù person) just... never replaced it.

Desperate times. I brought in my French press one day just so I wouldn‚Äôt turn into a productivity ghost. A coworker saw it, asked for a cup. Then another. Then another. Within a week, I was bringing in a whole *coffee station*. Grinder, beans, electric kettle, cute little labels like ‚ÄúCaffeine Cult Starter Pack.‚Äù

I thought it was funny. Until people started contributing. One person brought artisanal beans. Another brought syrups. Someone made a spreadsheet to sign up for ‚Äúbrew shifts.‚Äù There was even a passive-aggressive war over whether almond milk should be stocked. We had a Slack channel. **A SLACK CHANNEL FOR COFFEE.**

Fast forward to last week: Our boss walks in during ‚Äúbrew o‚Äôclock‚Äù (yes, we have a name for it) and just goes:

One of my coworkers, without missing a beat, said:

I had no idea who Brewdolph was. Apparently, they named me.

Now I‚Äôm ‚ÄúBrewdolph,‚Äù the reluctant coffee cult leader of the office.

Still no new Keurig though.",44,1760293375.0,story,6,0.77,False
