1or4uqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/school/comments/1or4uqm/short_stalls/,Short stalls,"I’m 22F, 6’2, and in my last year of college. Today was brutal three back-to-back lectures, two coffees, and a giant water bottle because I’m trying to “stay hydrated.” By the time my afternoon lab ended, I was doing the pee-dance down the hallway, thighs clenched, praying I wouldn’t leak.

I finally spot the women’s bathroom on the second floor of the science building—the one with the short stalls (dividers barely 5’6 high). I don’t care. I sprint in, shoes squeaking, pick the first open stall, slam the lock, and start yanking down my leggings and underwear in one frantic motion.

Just as I’m about to sit, I shift my weight and glance to the right old habit from checking if the stall’s actually empty. Big mistake.

There’s a girl in the next stall, fully seated, pants around her ankles, mid-stream. She’s maybe 5’0, so from her angle, my head is just… towering over the divider like a periscope. We lock eyes. Her face goes from relaxed to pure horror in 0.2 seconds.

She  SCREAMS a  full-on horror-movie shriek that echoes off the tiles. “WHAT THE HELL?! STOP STARING, YOU WEIRDO!”

I’m frozen, half-squatting, leggings tangled at my knees. “I’M TALL, I DIDN’T MEAN—” I stammer, but she’s already grabbing toilet paper like a curtain, still yelling, “GET OUT! PERVERT!”

The girl in the stall on my left gasps. Someone at the sinks drops their phone. The whole bathroom goes silent except for the drip-drip of my dignity hitting the floor.

I yank everything up (no wipe, still wet, whatever), nearly trip, and bolt out of the stall. Door bangs open. I don’t even wash my hands just power-walk down the hall, face burning, convinced everyone thinks I’m a bathroom creep.

Now I’m paranoid I’ll see her in class. Or that she told her friends. Or that there’s a group chat called “Beware the Tall Stall Stalker.”",2,1762546193.0,school,0,1.0,False

I’d love to find a penpal who enjoys meaningful conversation, random musings, and exchanging postcards or small creative tokens from time to time.

A little about me: I’m a hippy at heart with a love for art, architecture, and anything that sparks creativity. I spend my downtime sketching, journaling, cooking (I make a mean roast veg salad), and sipping strong coffee while daydreaming about travel. I adore learning about how other people see the world — their cultures, traditions, and little daily rituals. I think there’s something grounding and deeply human about writing letters. It forces you to slow down, think, and connect in a way that instant messages just don’t capture.

I’m based in Australia, surrounded by sunshine, the sound of cockatoos, and the occasional afternoon thunderstorm that makes everything smell fresh and earthy. I live a pretty full life with family, work, and a cat who believes he’s the centre of the universe (he probably is). But I’m craving that spark that comes from genuine human exchange — the sort of correspondence that can be lighthearted one day, reflective the next, and always full of personality.

What I’d love in a penpal: someone who’s curious about the world, open-minded, creative, and up for sharing a bit of their life through letters or emails. You don’t need to be a writer or artist — just someone who enjoys putting a bit of thought and heart into what they send. Maybe you like taking photos, collecting vintage stamps, cooking regional recipes, or simply sharing a slice of your world. I’d love to hear about your favourite local cafés, what inspires you, what music makes you feel alive, or what random thing you learned this week.

I’m happy to exchange both digital and physical mail — postcards, photos, playlists, small art pieces, recipes, or even just good stories. I think the best penpal connections happen when people are authentic and a little bit vulnerable — no need to impress, just show up as yourself.

If any of this sounds like your vibe, drop me a message or comment below! Tell me a bit about where you’re from, what kind of exchanges you’d enjoy, and what lights you up. Let’s bring a bit of slow-living and soul back into how we connect.

Looking forward to hearing from some kindred spirits out there. 💌",1,1762546147.0,penpals,0,1.0,False
1or4to9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1or4to9/20f_looking_for_genuine_friendship/,20f looking for genuine friendship,"Hi, I talked to so many ppl here and none of them was really genuine and serious about making a real friendship. So I’m posting again to see if I can find the real ppl who’s also looking for some real friendship.  

I’ll be honest about myself because I don’t want fake or shallow connections. I live with BPD, depression and social anxiety. That means I get attached really quickly if I like someone. So I’m serious about building a friendship with you.

I used to be Muslim, but I’ve left religion. And I’m an atheist now. 

What I like & value: Honest, genuine people who appreciate feelings. Deep talks, not shallow convos or cold replies. Space, astronomy, music (I’m obsessed with songs), nature, rain, coffee, matcha, and sometimes video games. People who can respect boundaries and give back the same energy. I love when people value me as much as I value them.

What I dislike: Narcissists (stay away, I can’t stand them). Fake, exploitative people if I notice someone is using me, I cut them off like they never existed. Surface-level friendships that disappear fast.

And to be honest, if I love you, I’ll get very clingy, obsessed, and stalker-ish haha. I can be crazy and weird sometimes, and other times quiet and sad for no reason. I’m shy in real life, and it takes time for me to feel safe, comfortable enough to show my true self.

What I usually listen to: Melanie Martinez - Lana del rey - Billie Eilish - Cigarettes After Sex - Arctic Monkeys - the smiths - Halsey - Radiohead - Aurora - Beach House - The Neighbourhood and more..

Perchlorate? Mars' 0.5-1% soil saboteur, thyroid-throttling toxin that'd make Earth farmers weep. Fix? Bacterial brigade (Dechloromonas & Azospira respire it to chloride crumbs, 90-95% purge in 6 months, USDA '24 data) teams with mealworms (Tenebrio molitor larvae munch waste, excreting 30-50% N/P/K-richer frass for soil supercharge, MDPI '21). Byproduct?

Food loop? Worms convert 10-15% scraps to 2M kg protein/yr for 1M weirdos (Stanford '17), closing circles tighter than a Falcon fairing. Data: Loops slash resupply 70% (HI-SEAS '25), morale +45% (no ""eat regolith"" riots). Rations? Retro. This? Eternal feast engine.)
Date: November 06, 2025 Mission: Your odyssey, overclocked: QOL hydro heresy for 1M Martian mavericks.

Enter symbiosis: Bacteria respire ClO₄⁻ to Cl⁻ (innocent ions for fert/bleach/fuel, Mohr's titration verified, UNL '25), while mealworms devour organics (50 mg waste/day/100 larvae, Stanford '17), pooping frass that amps soil 20-40% (MDPI '21). Overlap? Venn of victory: Bacteria handle toxins, worms enrich the aftermath—shared waste stream yields protein + purged plots. Scale? 1M oddballs (carnivore cosmonauts to vegan voids) get 21 kcal/day fresh, loops recycling 85% N/P/K (Battelle '25). Optimus? Logs prefs, stirs soups—efficiency eternal. Chloride cherry: Electrolysis to Cl₂/NaOH for plastics, or HCl rocket juice (SpaceX synergy, ND '13).

Starship sync: Methane from mealworm middens powers returns—poop to propulsion.
Symbiotic Spotlight: Bacteria + Mealworms – Toxin Tag-Team
Bacterial byproduct (Cl⁻) feeds the loop: Fert for quinoa (15% yield pop), disinfectant for ECLSS (2-5% O₂ co-boost), salt for rovers (20% dust dodge). Mealworms? Waste warriors—convert scraps to protein, frass to fert, closing food circles 70% tighter (HI-SEAS '25). Venn vibe: Bacteria purge (90% ClO₄⁻ gone), worms enrich (30% soil N kick)—overlap? Shared organics yield chloride-safe chow for 1M quirks. (Your Venn diagram visual: Crimson bacterial circle bleeding into mealworm gold, methane-green overlap pulsing with Cl⁻ icons—fert jars, bleach bots, rover salts orbiting like rogue asteroids. Labels crisp: ""95% Purge"" left, ""50 mg Waste/Day"" right, ""4k Tons CH4/yr Fuel"" center. It's the first-principles feast where bugs beat the void, turning FOMO into full-throttle symbiosis.)

1or4stm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesToldWeirdly/comments/1or4stm/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_2/,There’s Something Under the Boardwalk - [Part 2],"I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? Did it really blink at me? I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. If that was a dead nest, why wasn't it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ""Hello, It's Me"", Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn't sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ""What's that?"".

""Your drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?"" he said, gesturing in a chugging motion.

""Oh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.""

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. If your local watering hole doesn't keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don't bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ""It's on me, buddy."" He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. 

""You alright, man? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my thudding heart. How would I even have begun to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent's.

""Do you come here often?"" she said with a faux twang accent, pulling up in the vacated seat next to me. 

""I-uh... reckon."" I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

""Looks like we have the place all to ourselves,"" she remarked with a grin.

""Tommy better not leave the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there."" I quipped. 

She laughed. ""Perfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.""

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ""Here's to..."" I trailed off.

""Here's to another summer in the books,"" she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ""So are you local year round?""

I shook my head yes and clarified, ""Haven't always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?""

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent's and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven't been on one for miles.

""Enough about me, what are you up to?"" A question I was dreading. I answered very plainly, ""I don't know.""

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ""I'm just trying to figure somethings out. It's been a very long couple of years.""

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ""Do you want to talk about it?""

I shook it off. ""Not particularly, it'll pass. Just a matter of time.""

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

""Hey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre's, actually. We have one just like it.""

She looked down and declared. ""That's hilarious, that's where I stole this from!""

We both laughed.

""It wouldn't surprise me,"" I remarked. ""The staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.""

Our laughter echoed in the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song — ""These Eyes"" by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ""The Stones are my dad's favorite band. He named me Angie after the song."" 

I liked that, it fit her.

""My dad loved them too,"" I concurred. ""He took me to see them when I was a kid.""

She smiled. ""Sounds like a great dad to me.""

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me — maybe she'd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

""Everything okay?"" she inquired.

""Yeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.""

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would've seen it, right? Unless... did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ""Looks like I'm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre's.""

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone — few missed calls, few texts I didn't care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick's. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn't like to be kept waiting — Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ""I have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.""

Angie smiled wide. ""I love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?""

There was a pause. I didn't know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn't feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick's.

""I'm sure you'll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she's good I'll grab a slice for her this weekend.""

That was the best I could do. It was better than ""Run as fast as you can.""

""Do you need me to walk you home?""

She responded, ""I'm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It's their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.""

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ""I can wait here with her, I'm still cleaning up. I'll see you tomorrow night.""

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ""You never told me your name!""

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ""It doesn't really matter.""

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality — this one was thick. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights — an offseason signature — and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there — just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area — no sight of the album. It was around this time that I noticed it was a full moon. With a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning. I turned my phone flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took steps forward into the mouth of the boardwalk, searching the sandy floor — nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot. 

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the plastic sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye — the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn't stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my inquisitive feet prevailed. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate — it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

I'm overall a big enjoyer of life. I love to try new things and can appreciate many different tastes. Or maybe it’s ADHD lol.

I enjoy most types of food, music, movies, activities, I mean you name it and I probably have a wide variety of things in that particular category that I like. Of course I have my preferences, like fresh homemade coffee made by yours truly (I'm a little biased here) or my favorite sleeping position (also biased here)

I've never been too artsy or creative but I've started to find some peace in doing more creative work. I just ordered some supplies for a new creative hobby I've been wanting to try for a while, so I'm super excited about that (it’s a secret for now but if you ask I might give you the inside scoop)

Typically you'll find me at home because I can really sink into the homebody characteristic but I really do like to go out and have fun as well. If you want some pointers on how to miss all the mini golf puts then I'm your man.

I also like to workout and try to stay in shape. A healthy lifestyle is important for me. I’m still a big snacker though so don’t worry.

Next year I’ll probably live on Mars, I hear the weather is great there.

I'm overall a big enjoyer of life. I love to try new things and can appreciate many different tastes. Or maybe it’s ADHD lol.

I enjoy most types of food, music, movies, activities, I mean you name it and I probably have a wide variety of things in that particular category that I like. Of course I have my preferences, like fresh homemade coffee made by yours truly (I'm a little biased here) or my favorite sleeping position (also biased here)

I've never been too artsy or creative but I've started to find some peace in doing more creative work. I just ordered some supplies for a new creative hobby I've been wanting to try for a while, so I'm super excited about that (it’s a secret for now but if you ask I might give you the inside scoop)

Typically you'll find me at home because I can really sink into the homebody characteristic but I really do like to go out and have fun as well. If you want some pointers on how to miss all the mini golf puts then I'm your man.

I also like to workout and try to stay in shape. A healthy lifestyle is important for me. I’m still a big snacker though so don’t worry.

For the record, I do use AI, but for grammar and puctuation correction only!!

Now this is a first scene of a enemies-to-lovers novel about FMC FBI agent and MMC imprisoned ex-gang leader. 

\*\*\*

I was wondering my whole life: do they paint the interrogation rooms in this yellowish eggshell color and then light it with the greenest fluorescent light they can find for some specific purpose, or is it just a design choice to make it feel more like someone who wants me to tell all over it?

I am still considering offering to my boss to repaint it at least green so it wouldn't make me puke every time I come in here. Cause apparently from now on my visits to this room should become my new favorite routine.

In general, the whole building requires some kind of attention. I would suggest demolishing and rebuilding it. But for now—hey, at least the fifth-floor coffee machine was changed two years ago, and yet it still makes the most awful coffee in the world. John always used to say that we didn't come here for the gastronomical experience to justify it, but now that he is no longer here, I don't feel bad for criticizing that coffee, and there's no one to stop me.

Honestly, everyone kind of knows that the main thing about the cops is their donuts and their coffee, and isn't it crazy that our own office cannot provide that?

So what I do instead—I go to the Panera on Fifth Avenue every morning before work, and I pretend that bagels count as donuts. You know, a little bit fancier donuts.

Actually, it's quite nice. The Panera opens at 5:00 a.m., and at around 5:30 I'm there with a cup of hazelnut coffee and two cinnamon raisin bagels with cream cheese.

And before you tell me how excessive that is—I know, and I frankly do not care, because I like my bagels and I like my hazelnut coffee, and I care much more about them than about your opinion.

The metal doors finally scratch the linoleum. That ungodly sound suggests that my today's project has arrived. John also said that it is not according to protocol to call people I interview “projects,” but then again, he's not my mentor anymore.

Actually, hadn't his greed taken over him, he would be sitting right now right here in my place. And I would probably bring him that awful drainage water we call coffee.

So am I glad he quit? I don't know. Time will show. I liked him more than other people in this room, but I never considered him to be an authority for me. And one Friday evening proved that to be right—when he came to my desk with a box of candy and explained he had just signed his resignation.

I am not completely sure why he decided that chocolates would make up for keeping his future plans a secret from a person he called his favorite protégé for two months. But then again, I didn't bother to ask. He was way too good of a manipulator, and I saw him do the tricks on countless criminals and get away with it, so I’m pretty sure the same fate was awaiting my question.

Two Marshalls with their funny hats brought him in.

The first thing I noticed about him was that he had the exact same build as the Marshalls. The only giveaway, apart from his awful white inmate uniform, was a glare in his glassy grey eyes.

I've never seen a Marshall with a story behind his eyes. But I have never seen a Marshall who formed a thought as well.

“We are starting the record number 35221 of interrogation of Federal prisoner number 889212, Mikhail Frolov, on November 8, 2026,” I said. I didn't want to turn his voice as he was sat down on the metal chair. I knew whoever had to listen to this record wouldn't be blessed, because the sound of metal against metal echoed back and forth across the whole room.

“Hello, Mr. Frolov,” I offered a greeting. “I will be conducting interviews with you from now on as Agent Mayers—he's not available for this case anymore.”

“Yeah, hun, I know. He told me he's opening a private practice,” he said, his accent barely scratching through.

‘Way to go, John, telling some rando murderer about your plans.’ He was apparently more important to John than me.

Starship sync: Methane from mealworm middens powers returns—poop to propulsion.
Symbiotic Spotlight: Bacteria + Mealworms – Toxin Tag-Team
Bacterial byproduct (Cl⁻) feeds the loop: Fert for quinoa (15% yield pop), disinfectant for ECLSS (2-5% O₂ co-boost), salt for rovers (20% dust dodge). Mealworms? Waste warriors—convert scraps to protein, frass to fert, closing food circles 70% tighter (HI-SEAS '25). Venn vibe: Bacteria purge (90% ClO₄⁻ gone), worms enrich (30% soil N kick)—overlap? Shared organics yield chloride-safe chow for 1M quirks. (Your Venn diagram visual: Crimson bacterial circle bleeding into mealworm gold, methane-green overlap pulsing with Cl⁻ icons—fert jars, bleach bots, rover salts orbiting like rogue asteroids.

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

**Pros and Cons of Mitolyn – An Honest Snapshot**

I’ve now spent 90 days with Mitolyn. I’ve felt its highs and noted its tiny drawbacks. If you're wondering whether it's for you, here’s my honest take.

Let’s start with the pros. **The most obvious win is daily energy.** Mitolyn doesn’t hype you up like caffeine—it smooths out your entire day. There’s no crash, no jitters, just steady fuel that makes you more productive, alert, and clear-headed. For someone juggling work and life, this is a game-changer.

Another massive pro? **The science-backed formulation.** You can tell this isn’t some slapped-together supplement with fluff ingredients. Mitolyn zeroes in on mitochondrial support, metabolism, and inflammation in a way that’s focused and deliberate. It targets root causes, not just symptoms. I appreciated knowing every capsule was doing serious internal work, even when I didn’t “feel” it right away.

There’s also **trust built into the brand**—which matters. Everything from how the website explains the sourcing to how they handle customer service screams integrity. Plus, the transparent return policy and lack of shady upsells gave me peace of mind.

**>> I WAS SKEPTICAL TOO… UNTIL THE RESULTS STARTED STACKING UP. TRY MITOLYN AND FEEL IT FOR YOURSELF (75% Off).**

I also can’t underplay how **natural it feels.** No chemicals, no harsh stimulants, no “detox symptoms.” It slides into your life without disruption, and you forget you’re even taking something until your clothes fit better and your brain works faster.

Now, for the cons. **The price isn’t exactly budget-friendly.** At nearly $69 per bottle if you don’t bulk buy, it’s an investment. I’d argue it’s worth every penny, especially when you factor in skipped coffee runs and fewer doctor visits—but for someone tight on funds, it might sting upfront.

Another minor downside? **Patience is required.** Mitolyn doesn’t promise overnight miracles—and it doesn’t deliver them. You need to stick with it for weeks to start seeing real results. If you're expecting a quick fix, you’ll be disappointed. But if you're committed to real transformation, this will reward you.

No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, **I noticed less bloating after dinner**, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the **3PM crash** that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

**Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress**

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. **My cravings were practically gone**, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. **My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper.** And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

**Takeaway for Month 2:** Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

**Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health**

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# ✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

# ✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

**Takeaway for Month 3:** Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

**The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well**

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: **cellular energy is everything.** The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

**Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up**

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to **fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production**, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**

**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the **extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around.** These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. **The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times.** I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. **If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.**

**>> Don’t Just Take My Word For It—*****Experience The Difference*****\*\* With Mitolyn For Yourself.\*\***

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. **That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.**

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.",1,1762545467.0,Kingsthrone,1,1.0,False

# 💊 What Is Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is a dietary supplement formulated to support mitochondrial health. The brand claims it can improve cellular energy, mental clarity, and overall physical performance. It typically contains ingredients like:

* **CoQ10** – For cellular energy and heart support
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** – Promotes energy metabolism and brain function
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – An antioxidant that helps protect cells
* **B Vitamins** – Supports energy levels and nervous system health

Sounds promising, right? But what are people actually saying?

# 🧵 Mitolyn Reviews Reddit: Real Users Speak Out

Reddit is one of the few places where you can find brutally honest opinions. When you search **“Mitolyn reviews Reddit”**, the first thing you’ll notice is that the community is pretty divided. Here’s what I gathered:

**👍 Positive Reddit Reviews:**

Some users claim they’ve seen real benefits from using Mitolyn. In particular, several people in Nootropics and Supplements mentioned:

* **Improved focus** – Especially helpful for people dealing with brain fog or mental fatigue.
* **More energy** – Users who struggle with chronic fatigue or low motivation said Mitolyn gave them a noticeable energy boost.
* **Mood support** – A few posts suggested it helped stabilize mood or reduce anxiety.

One Redditor wrote:  
*“I’ve been using Mitolyn for about 3 weeks now, and I feel like I’m finally getting through the afternoon slump without needing more coffee. Energy feels smoother—not jittery.”*

**👎 Negative Reddit Reviews and Complaints:**

On the flip side, some users were unimpressed. Searching **“Mitolyn reviews and complaints”**, I found feedback like:

* **No noticeable effect** – A lot of people said they didn’t feel any different after using it for weeks.
* **Too expensive** – Some Reddit users felt the price point didn’t match the results.
* **Mild side effects** – A few users reported headaches or stomach discomfort after taking it.

One comment read:  
*“Honestly? Didn’t do much for me. I wanted it to help with brain fog but it was just meh. Maybe it works for others, but I’m not buying again.”*

# 🔬 Does Science Back It Up?

Looking beyond Reddit, I checked into the ingredients. Most of them have been individually studied for their effects on mitochondrial health and cognitive function:

* **CoQ10** has strong evidence for supporting heart and cell health, especially in people over 40.
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** is often used for cognitive support and may help with mental energy.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** is a known antioxidant with some promising anti-inflammatory effects.

So, while Mitolyn’s ingredients are backed by science, whether it “works” comes down to how your body responds to the blend. That’s probably why **Mitolyn reviews** are so mixed.

# 🛒 Where Can You Buy Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is available on its official website only . Prices vary depending on the supply (monthly vs. 3-month supply), but it’s generally in the mid to high range for supplements.

⚠️ **Pro tip:** If you’re buying from third-party sellers, double-check for authenticity. Some Reddit users warned about knock-offs or expired stock on lesser-known sites.

# 📦 Shipping, Returns, and Customer Service

While looking into **Mitolyn reviews and complaints**, a few themes came up around customer service:

* **Shipping is generally fast**, especially within the U.S.
* **Customer support is responsive** according to some, but others reported difficulty getting refunds.
* **Return policy**: Some Redditors mentioned that the return window is tight, and only unopened bottles qualify.

One user said:  
*“I tried to return it after two weeks, but they said it had to be unopened. I wasn’t thrilled with that.”*

So, if you’re on the fence, it might be smart to order just one bottle and see how you react before committing to a larger supply.

# ✅ Final Verdict: Is Mitolyn Worth Trying?

If you’re dealing with low energy, brain fog, or just looking to optimize mitochondrial health, Mitolyn could be worth a try. The ingredients are solid, and there are plenty of **Mitolyn reviews** that suggest it helps—especially for people in their 30s and older.",1,1762545450.0,Kingsthrone,1,1.0,False
1or4i7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1or4i7c/i_was_an_engineer_in_heaven_now_im_a_guest_in/,"I was an Engineer in Heaven. Now, I'm a Guest in Purgatory.","When the elevator doors opened and Gabriel stepped out, escorted by an unfamiliar face donning a familiar uniform, I thought for a second I was seeing a ghost. He'd been there recently enough that his chewing gum's minty smell still lingered in the dormitory's corridors, comingling with the odor of copper and burnt-out electronics. The last time I had seen him was three weeks earlier, as he departed from Heaven for the first time, the sound of his sarcasm following him into the backseat of the van that carried both him and Matteo back to the airport.

""Welcome back to Heaven, Father! There's even less left now than the first time you were here."" I said, attempting to diffuse the sour look that was already plastered across his face.

""You know very well I'd have rather stayed in Rome than ever come back to this frozen *hellscape.""* He said, a bitterness in his voice even deeper than the mines that ran beneath our very feet (if any of them were even *left* after the events that transpired here during his last visit, or the events that were to come).

""What do you-"" I started my response, but was cut short by Gabriel rushing me and grabbing my coat, nearly lifting me off my feet.

""Hear me now, *boy.* I had *nothing* to do with Sister Lucia's disappearance, and you know that!"" He was screaming now, froth forming at the corners of his mouth, either from the disintegration of the gum he was chewing or the sheer rage that now drove him towards me, ""I only *agreed* to come back so I could throttle you for the implicat-"" He was cut off by one of the guards hitting him with a low-power burst, causing him to lose grip of my jacket and fall to the snow.

""Stand down,"" I warned the guard, holding up my hand and signalling for him to put away his weapon. ""Father, what do you *mean* you had nothing to do with Lucia's disappearance? That fact is obvious; unless you can atomize people at will, nobody in their right mind would accuse you of such.""

The bitterness in his face melted into a scowl once again, not of hatred but of contemplation. ""So you *aren't* the one who sent these goons to my parish, dragging my poor elderly Bishop along behind them to accuse me of *murder*, or *worse?""* He questioned, his eyes scanning my face, likely looking for signs of a deception that even *I* wasn't privy to.

""Father, I was only just this morning informed that you would be returning to us, and I was told you would be doing so *willingly*."" I directed this last word more in the direction of the priest's captors than him, once again warning them with my eyes that he was not to be touched again. They took the hint and started back towards the front gate, where the van still idled. I helped him to his feet and brought him inside.

""They cornered me as I left my office. I was bundled into a closed room, in a catacomb where the light of God has likely never shone. My bishop was there waiting, along with *those two*,"" he explained, looking over his shoulder towards the vault door that led back to the snow outside. ""They had 'evidence' of what I had 'done' to Lucia; a video of us walking through a terminal together, and Father Matteo and I pulling her into a door\*... God\* knows what they were implying we did to her. You and I both know that such a video should not exist. Lucia *never* left this nightmare, and it occurs to me now that I likely won't escape it either."" He finished, rage fading to hopelessness as he bowed his head and looked at the floor.

""Once again, Father, I assure you I had no part in this. The Field does not take kindly to *coercion*. Anyone versed in the incident logs of the previous experiments should have known that, and should never have done what has been done to you."" The knot in my stomach had tightened,  Have you heard from the other Father who was here with you?""

At about this time, I heard the howl of the wind from the front door opening cut above the constant hum that surrounded the facility. I started to walk back towards the door, but spotted the source of the commotion before I made it very far; Dr. Kruger, the Site Director of Theta-7 and the foremost expert in the entirety of the organization when it came to entity containment, was hurrying towards his office with his signature briefcase clutched tightly in his fist. He paused just long enough to piss me off. ""Good Morning, Erik. I hope you are ready to *redeem* yourself for your previous failures. I will be overseeing the experiments *personally* this week.""

Shortly after the devil himself walked back into Heaven, I spotted the lost lamb of the dynamic duo wandering the corridors. Matteo paused in front of the rebuilt chapel, examining the freshly installed containment lattice.

Of my own design, and one of the few things on this rock that *actually* stood a snowball's chance in *Hell* of containing the Type-A that manifested three weeks before. The lattice consisted of three modified RDCs capable of creating an overlapping Nullity, with a state-of-the-art PRN array in the center, which would generate a pocket of stable Kyrie Field. In theory, any entity that was caught in the lattice would have two choices: be forced into the pocket of stable resonance or have its KF signature torn to shreds by the Nullity emanating from the RDCs.

I met Father Matteo in the corridor outside the chapel and greeted him. It should go almost without saying, but he wasn't there by choice either. I strongly suspected that *Kruger* was behind this; of course, in his relentless search for an answer in the void, he *would* allow his hubris to lead him to forget the very basics of Field research, or worse, *ignore* them.

I led the pair to their rooms for tonight, the very same rooms they stayed in on their first visit, actually. I did not fail to notice that a guard was now patrolling the wing, and heavy-duty locks had been installed on all three doors. At that point, I hadn't yet realized that *Heaven* had become a *prison* for more than just the entities we intended to contain. I retired to my own quarters shortly thereafter.

In the drop box outside my door, I noticed a manila envelope with my name on it. Inside were the details of the experiments to be performed in the days to follow, culminating with the attempted capture of the Type-A entity that had eluded our grasp thus far. I immediately noticed a perceived flaw within the Bad Doctor's plan; there were only two celebrants listed in the personnel section of the documents.

""Why is this an issue?"" you may be asking. Well, fear not, dear reader, Erik is eternally long-winded and has an answer!

It was believed in the early days of Penumbra that any fewer than three celebrants would never cause any meaningful fluctuation in local Kyrie Field readings. This was and still is *usually* correct *(ever wonder why the minimum number of witches in a coven is generally accepted to be three?),* with some exceptions. The exceptions noted were as follows:

1. An individual with *exceptionally* high KF sensitivity and *exceptional* conviction in their beliefs (regardless of what those beliefs may have been, but Catholicism was found to be the belief system with the most repeatable results both for single individual testing and trio testing) was capable of causing measurable local KF fluctuations similar to those of a trio of lesser KF-sensitive individuals. I have only met *three* such individuals, each more dangerous than the last. The strongest of the three was capable of healing even the most grievous wounds of others at will. I have heard rumors of some *even stronger.*
2. If any one of the three celebrants were infirm or insincere in their convictions, even if all three were KF-sensitive, fluctuations would often fail to occur (or worse, unstable fluctuations would occur, often with detrimental results). I myself fall into this category. I am somewhat sensitive to the Kyrie Field, and I was raised Catholic, but I could never bring myself to blindly believe anything; I needed *Data.*
3. If any one of the three celebrants were completely KF-inert (meaning they had *no* sensitivity to the Kyrie Field), then fluctuations would fail to occur altogether. I suspect that Dr. Kruger fell into *this* category.

The reason, which I believed at the time, that Kruger's plan was flawed, was the fact that *neither* of the Fathers present was sensitive enough to the Field to produce results alone, and even if they were, a trio was still best practice. It wasn't until I got to the *equipment* section of the document that I realized there was an additional RDC listed, purportedly modified to amplify the KF sensitivity of existing conduits, designated ""RDC-L-1"".

I believed, naively, that this was perhaps some purely technological breakthrough that was being trialed here due to our proximity to the joint research facility not far away. The facility in question is the combined effort of the Technologians, the last known *sane* sect of what would have previously been called the *Purist Enclave,* and whatever faithfully remained of the *Scholars* of the old days as well, colloquially known as ""Puragatory"". While our methods and motivations were *vastly* different, Heaven and Purgatory ""shared notes"" sometimes.

I would later come to find that this RDC was *not* the work of any Purists. A Purist wouldn't come *near* that thing if they knew what it really was...

Having read through the documentation and having had a good idea of the rough schedule for the following morning, I set my coffee machine timer to have a steaming flask ready for me at 07:00.

It is at this point that I believe I owe you, dear reader, an explanation. If you have read Matteo's story, which begins [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oeq6sj/i_was_sent_by_the_vatican_to_help_a_group_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), you will already know by now who I am and have a good general idea of who I work for, and what I do. I have *also* read Matteo's stories, and rest assured, he will be in no trouble for writing them here. With this being said, I would *strongly* recommend reading Matteo's story first, or at least alongside my own, as the whole picture will be very difficult to glean from this text alone.

As you know, along the way, I promised him some answers. Instead of a Q&A session, I have decided that I will write a story similar to his, with *my* perspective on his second visit to Heaven, as well as some experienced insight on people, places, and things that he requested knowledge about scattered throughout this account, ending with where we are now and what we are currently doing. Think of this as the ""*Director's Commentary""* edition of the story. *Forgive* me if this sounds a bit drier than his tale. I am an *Engineer,* and not a *poet*, after all.

Now, back to the story at hand.

\---

I awoke early enough to see the last drips of coffee fall into my flask, and quickly prepared myself for the short walk to the Chapel. I made it to the makeshift command center just in time to see RDC-L-1 being wheeled to the center of the chapel and placed upon its tripod; from what I could see, this was actually a modified *Field Sphere*, which is itself a miniaturized version of the RDC with some extra features built into it, such as a KF sensor array and self-contained Null generator. Those extra features, however, had been stripped away from this one, only the RDC core itself remaining, wired into the surrounding PRN array.

Taking a cursory glance at my monitor, I noticed something unusual; though no one else was in the chapel, the very beginnings of a resonance pattern could already be seen in the graph. Even *more* strange was that I vaguely *recognized* the pattern. It was one I had seen recently, I knew, but I did not connect the dots until later. Very shortly after noticing the pattern, I saw a spike in local KF fluctuations and noticed Matteo and Gabriel walking in, being escorted by Kruger.

""Good morning, Erik. Early to the party as always, I see."" He jeered quietly as he took his place beside me on the command center. He then addressed the room, announcing the start of the experiment. Today was simply meant to be resonant testing and analysis. Another breadcrumb on a long trail that led to eventual, unholy revelation was the *manner* in which he announced the experiment; he mentioned RDC-L-1 alongside Matteo and Gabriel, as if it ***were*** the third celebrant.

The testing itself differed from the norm as well; instead of starting with the usual Bible passages, Kruger had the Fathers read through a multitude of strange documents. Random numbers, gibberish, and more gibberish.

\---

Before I begin this next part, I feel another explanation is in order. You may be asking yourself, having read Matteo's story, ""Erik, after seeing and hearing what was *obviously* a literal angel quote *Biblical scripture*, how can you still have doubts?"" A fine question, my *sweet, Summer child.* 

The entities in the field will almost always take the form and disposition that is expected of them by the majority of the celebrants. Those of the Abrahamic faiths, for example, will cause the voices and apparitions to be *angelic* or *demonic* in nature, depending on the type of entity and whether it is malicious or not, whereas those believing themselves to be a coven of witches summoning Baphomet, for example, will see exactly what they imagine Baphomet to be if it succeeds, for better or worse. 

There is still no consensus on whether or not certain beliefs *attract* certain KF entities, or whether the entities simply *mold* themselves to the beliefs of the celebrants; however, I subscribe to the latter school of thought rather than the former.

Why would I tell *you* this, or, more pertinently, why would I tell either of the *Fathers* this? Wouldn't this information compromise them as viable conduits? Introduce doubt? The truth is that, at this point, I see Matteo and Gabriel as more than conduits in an experiment; these are men that I have escaped death alongside, not once, but *twice.* Though I doubt my words would shake their faith to begin with. And, well, Matteo *did ask*.

\---

That day was... different. The voice that manifested seemed to be *derived* from Matteo and Gabriel's beliefs about what an angel might say, right? ""Be Not Afraid"" is even one of the most common phrases reported by observers and celebrants alike, and for obvious reasons. The difference was not what was *said,* but *who* said it. The voice was one that I (and many others) had heard before; it was ***Anja's*** voice. 

Anja's voice is *not* a good sign, but it doesn't always spell disaster; the description I gave to the Fathers after this event *was* accurate, but not whole. She *is* known as the ""First Witness,"" but there is another. No, it wasn't *me* who slipped those men the book that Matteo mentioned in his story, though I do suspect I know who it was. Sadly, he never made it out of Heaven that day.

\---

The next day, at around 11:45, I was at the command center terminal reviewing resonance readings from the previous day's tests, as well as from the tests performed during Matteo and Gabriel's first visit to Heaven. This is when I actually put two and two together and realized *why* that resonance pattern from the day before looked so familiar. The resonance pattern was *Lucia's* resonance pattern, slightly less intense but otherwise identical to her patterns from previous tests. I was unsure what to make of this at the time, and had no time to dwell on the thought since, at about that same time, Kruger walked in and took his place beside me again. 

""Today is a *big* day, Erik. I *sincerely* hope your lattice is ready,"" he snarled at me, and I could see over his shoulder that Matteo and Gabriel were walking into the chapel, taking their place beside the modified RDC. 

The celebrants began their chanting, and for the first few moments, all was quiet. Then, all at once, the pattern I was tracking that showed the similarity with Lucia's increased in intensity to something far beyond any resonance frequency I had ever seen, and the monitor in front of me screamed the alarm. In addition to Lucia's resonance pattern, another familiar pattern appeared on the graphs: the pattern of the NCE that went CE Type-A on us last time, and it was growing. Fast.

""Shut it down! Shut it down now!"" I screamed to the technicians along the walls, already noticing that Lucia's resonance pattern was taking a nosedive as the entity's pattern grew exponentially, the graph automatically zooming out in resolution, showing a pattern that dwarfed even Lucia's previous record. Kruger gave me a look of pure disdain, a look that said, ""You aren't running the show, stay quiet and let it happen."" The technicians noticed the look he gave me had shifted to them, and stopped mid-run.

""Maintain Cadence!"" he shouted, but I doubt the celebrants even heard him over the roar of the entity's scripture and the blaring of the alarms. As every light in the chapel turned the color of fresh blood, I pulled Kruger up by the collar and screamed at him over the din: ""We have to shut it down! It's feeding on the resonance decay from L-1!""

""We're prepared this time, the lattice will hold!"" he yelled back, but I could tell he was *not* confident in his own answer. I shot a look back at my monitor. The pattern had grown beyond the measuring limits of the hardware and had frozen at a level far beyond what was even considered to be *theoretically possible* at the time.

""We weren't prepared for it to consume a near infinite source of resonant energy!"" I screamed at him, then realized my endeavor to convince the man was an exercise in futility, and ran for the emergency shutoff myself, but not before hearing the *voice* that I had been dreading, the *true* harbinger of destruction. The voice of the Second Witness, intermingled with Anja's.

***""We await His arrival.""***

This was *bad.* Very *bad.* An unprecedented level of *badness* was unfolding before my very eyes. Entities with resonance patterns one-hundredth the size of the pattern I had seen on the monitor had leveled entire facilities and resulted in absolute chaos for the surrounding region. And these manifestations were *always* preceded by the Second's voice.

The manifestation event itself was also unprecedented. Never before had KF entities been known to merge with each other, much less merge with technology in the way that this entity did. I voiced this aloud, and Kruger's response all but confirmed my darkest fears; RDC-L-1 wasn't *just* a modified RDC. 

The documentation I recovered from Kruger's suitcase called it a ""Synthetic Conduit Core,"" and the incident log provided detailed information that, when Lucia's body was atomized in the previous experiments, her KF signature suddenly began emitting from a Field Sphere in the Swedish QRCT's equipment room, just on the other side of the same mountian Heaven was built into, setting off several alarms in the process. Studies on the Field Sphere compared the signature to data collected at Heaven to confirm this; it is almost as if her very *essen*ce was transferred into the Field Sphere. 

\---

What the entity said next chills me to the absolute depths of my core, even to this day:

***""For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.""***

And that, my friends, is why *coercion* is to be avoided at all times while doing Field research. I will state it again, ***the Field does not take kindly to coercion*****.** Of any kind, but especially KF-sensitive individuals being coerced to perform rites and chants in an attempt to deliberately draw an entity, it ""poisons the well"" per se. This is why we brought the Fathers to Heaven under the pretense of helping us ""find God"" during their first visit, so that they would come and perform ***willingly.***

I will not bore you with the details of our escape from Heaven, as you would have likely read Matteo's account, and mine would be nearly identical. I will tell you that my favorite part of that entire, terrible day was watching Kruger get turned into a pillar of salt. Lol, Lmao even. That guy deserved it. My least favorite part would have to have been getting shrapnel dug out of my back by an overly suspicious physician, but that is neither here nor there.

\---

""What are you three up to now?"" you ask. Well, we are still in Purgatory for the time being, but I have received word through official channels that none of us are being blamed for what happened in Heaven, and Matteo and Gabriel are free to return to their homes at their leisure; however, they *have* been offered an interesting deal, should they decide to stay *local.* You see, when the mountain housing Heaven exploded, it took out the entire Swedish QRCT with it. Fathers Matteo and Gabriel have been offered positions on the new QRCT, and I myself have been offered a position at the Thunderdome as a trainer, since the resident trainer who *was* there, Elliot, has accepted a position as a Field Commander over several of the US-based QRCTs.

Matteo has tentatively *declined* this offer and has stated that he would like nothing more than to return home and live out the rest of his days tending to his Flock, but Father Gabriel seemed eager to accept a role as a Field Chaplain. No idea why. I'm not so sure that training fresh idiots to be the real-life equivalent of ""Men in Black meets Ghost Busters"" is in the cards for me, though, but we will see what the future holds. 

Also, as part of my deal with Matteo, I will answer any of *your reasonable* questions as long as they are posted within the next day or so. Ask away, I suppose, but don't blame me if you *don't like the answer you get.*

Now, I'm a Guest in Purgatory.","When the elevator doors opened and Gabriel stepped out, escorted by an unfamiliar face donning a familiar uniform, I thought for a second I was seeing a ghost. He'd been there recently enough that his chewing gum's minty smell still lingered in the dormitory's corridors, comingling with the odor of copper and burnt-out electronics. The last time I had seen him was three weeks earlier, as he departed from Heaven for the first time, the sound of his sarcasm following him into the backseat of the van that carried both him and Matteo back to the airport.

""Welcome back to Heaven, Father! There's even less left now than the first time you were here."" I said, attempting to diffuse the sour look that was already plastered across his face.

""You know very well I'd have rather stayed in Rome than ever come back to this frozen *hellscape.""* He said, a bitterness in his voice even deeper than the mines that ran beneath our very feet (if any of them were even *left* after the events that transpired here during his last visit, or the events that were to come).

""What do you-"" I started my response, but was cut short by Gabriel rushing me and grabbing my coat, nearly lifting me off my feet.

""Hear me now, *boy.* I had *nothing* to do with Sister Lucia's disappearance, and you know that!"" He was screaming now, froth forming at the corners of his mouth, either from the disintegration of the gum he was chewing or the sheer rage that now drove him towards me, ""I only *agreed* to come back so I could throttle you for the implicat-"" He was cut off by one of the guards hitting him with a low-power burst, causing him to lose grip of my jacket and fall to the snow.

""Stand down,"" I warned the guard, holding up my hand and signalling for him to put away his weapon. ""Father, what do you *mean* you had nothing to do with Lucia's disappearance? That fact is obvious; unless you can atomize people at will, nobody in their right mind would accuse you of such.""

The bitterness in his face melted into a scowl once again, not of hatred but of contemplation. ""So you *aren't* the one who sent these goons to my parish, dragging my poor elderly Bishop along behind them to accuse me of *murder*, or *worse?""* He questioned, his eyes scanning my face, likely looking for signs of a deception that even *I* wasn't privy to.

""Father, I was only just this morning informed that you would be returning to us, and I was told you would be doing so *willingly*."" I directed this last word more in the direction of the priest's captors than him, once again warning them with my eyes that he was not to be touched again. They took the hint and started back towards the front gate, where the van still idled. I helped him to his feet and brought him inside.

""They cornered me as I left my office. I was bundled into a closed room, in a catacomb where the light of God has likely never shone. My bishop was there waiting, along with *those two*,"" he explained, looking over his shoulder towards the vault door that led back to the snow outside. ""They had 'evidence' of what I had 'done' to Lucia; a video of us walking through a terminal together, and Father Matteo and I pulling her into a door\*... God\* knows what they were implying we did to her. You and I both know that such a video should not exist. Lucia *never* left this nightmare, and it occurs to me now that I likely won't escape it either."" He finished, rage fading to hopelessness as he bowed his head and looked at the floor.

""Once again, Father, I assure you I had no part in this. The Field does not take kindly to *coercion*. Anyone versed in the incident logs of the previous experiments should have known that, and should never have done what has been done to you."" The knot in my stomach had tightened,  Have you heard from the other Father who was here with you?""

At about this time, I heard the howl of the wind from the front door opening cut above the constant hum that surrounded the facility. I started to walk back towards the door, but spotted the source of the commotion before I made it very far; Dr. Kruger, the Site Director of Theta-7 and the foremost expert in the entirety of the organization when it came to entity containment, was hurrying towards his office with his signature briefcase clutched tightly in his fist. He paused just long enough to piss me off. ""Good Morning, Erik. I hope you are ready to *redeem* yourself for your previous failures. I will be overseeing the experiments *personally* this week.""

Shortly after the devil himself walked back into Heaven, I spotted the lost lamb of the dynamic duo wandering the corridors. Matteo paused in front of the rebuilt chapel, examining the freshly installed containment lattice.

Of my own design, and one of the few things on this rock that *actually* stood a snowball's chance in *Hell* of containing the Type-A that manifested three weeks before. The lattice consisted of three modified RDCs capable of creating an overlapping Nullity, with a state-of-the-art PRN array in the center, which would generate a pocket of stable Kyrie Field. In theory, any entity that was caught in the lattice would have two choices: be forced into the pocket of stable resonance or have its KF signature torn to shreds by the Nullity emanating from the RDCs.

I met Father Matteo in the corridor outside the chapel and greeted him. It should go almost without saying, but he wasn't there by choice either. I strongly suspected that *Kruger* was behind this; of course, in his relentless search for an answer in the void, he *would* allow his hubris to lead him to forget the very basics of Field research, or worse, *ignore* them.

I led the pair to their rooms for tonight, the very same rooms they stayed in on their first visit, actually. I did not fail to notice that a guard was now patrolling the wing, and heavy-duty locks had been installed on all three doors. At that point, I hadn't yet realized that *Heaven* had become a *prison* for more than just the entities we intended to contain. I retired to my own quarters shortly thereafter.

In the drop box outside my door, I noticed a manila envelope with my name on it. Inside were the details of the experiments to be performed in the days to follow, culminating with the attempted capture of the Type-A entity that had eluded our grasp thus far. I immediately noticed a perceived flaw within the Bad Doctor's plan; there were only two celebrants listed in the personnel section of the documents.

""Why is this an issue?"" you may be asking. Well, fear not, dear reader, Erik is eternally long-winded and has an answer!

It was believed in the early days of Penumbra that any fewer than three celebrants would never cause any meaningful fluctuation in local Kyrie Field readings. This was and still is *usually* correct *(ever wonder why the minimum number of witches in a coven is generally accepted to be three?),* with some exceptions. The exceptions noted were as follows:

1. An individual with *exceptionally* high KF sensitivity and *exceptional* conviction in their beliefs (regardless of what those beliefs may have been, but Catholicism was found to be the belief system with the most repeatable results both for single individual testing and trio testing) was capable of causing measurable local KF fluctuations similar to those of a trio of lesser KF-sensitive individuals. I have only met *three* such individuals, each more dangerous than the last. The strongest of the three was capable of healing even the most grievous wounds of others at will. I have heard rumors of some *even stronger.*
2. If any one of the three celebrants were infirm or insincere in their convictions, even if all three were KF-sensitive, fluctuations would often fail to occur (or worse, unstable fluctuations would occur, often with detrimental results). I myself fall into this category. I am somewhat sensitive to the Kyrie Field, and I was raised Catholic, but I could never bring myself to blindly believe anything; I needed *Data.*
3. If any one of the three celebrants were completely KF-inert (meaning they had *no* sensitivity to the Kyrie Field), then fluctuations would fail to occur altogether. I suspect that Dr. Kruger fell into *this* category.

The reason, which I believed at the time, that Kruger's plan was flawed, was the fact that *neither* of the Fathers present was sensitive enough to the Field to produce results alone, and even if they were, a trio was still best practice. It wasn't until I got to the *equipment* section of the document that I realized there was an additional RDC listed, purportedly modified to amplify the KF sensitivity of existing conduits, designated ""RDC-L-1"".

I believed, naively, that this was perhaps some purely technological breakthrough that was being trialed here due to our proximity to the joint research facility not far away. The facility in question is the combined effort of the Technologians, the last known *sane* sect of what would have previously been called the *Purist Enclave,* and whatever faithfully remained of the *Scholars* of the old days as well, colloquially known as ""Puragatory"". While our methods and motivations were *vastly* different, Heaven and Purgatory ""shared notes"" sometimes.

I would later come to find that this RDC was *not* the work of any Purists. A Purist wouldn't come *near* that thing if they knew what it really was...

This is why we brought the Fathers to Heaven under the pretense of helping us ""find God"" during their first visit, so that they would come and perform ***willingly.***

I will not bore you with the details of our escape from Heaven, as you would have likely read Matteo's account, and mine would be nearly identical. I will tell you that my favorite part of that entire, terrible day was watching Kruger get turned into a pillar of salt. Lol, Lmao even. That guy deserved it. My least favorite part would have to have been getting shrapnel dug out of my back by an overly suspicious physician, but that is neither here nor there.

\---

""What are you three up to now?"" you ask. Well, we are still in Purgatory for the time being, but I have received word through official channels that none of us are being blamed for what happened in Heaven, and Matteo and Gabriel are free to return to their homes at their leisure; however, they *have* been offered an interesting deal, should they decide to stay *local.* You see, when the mountain housing Heaven exploded, it took out the entire Swedish QRCT with it. Fathers Matteo and Gabriel have been offered positions on the new QRCT, and I myself have been offered a position at the Thunderdome as a trainer, since the resident trainer who *was* there, Elliot, has accepted a position as a Field Commander over several of the US-based QRCTs.

Matteo has tentatively *declined* this offer and has stated that he would like nothing more than to return home and live out the rest of his days tending to his Flock, but Father Gabriel seemed eager to accept a role as a Field Chaplain. No idea why. I'm not so sure that training fresh idiots to be the real-life equivalent of ""Men in Black meets Ghost Busters"" is in the cards for me, though, but we will see what the future holds. 

Also, as part of my deal with Matteo, I will answer any of *your reasonable* questions as long as they are posted within the next day or so. Ask away, I suppose, but don't blame me if you *don't like the answer you get.*

Yours truly,

I enjoy people who are thoughtful, grounded, and can laugh at life without needing everything to be perfect. The best conversations are ones that start easy and end somewhere meaningful.

I’m 27 and from England. I run my own business, which keeps me busy but gives me the freedom to shape my days. Most mornings start with coffee and a walk with my dogs before the world wakes up. I enjoy cooking and baking, experimenting with new recipes or perfecting the ones that bring a bit of nostalgia. I also spend time on film photography and love noticing small details in the world that most people might miss. Being outside, whether it’s walking, running, or just sitting in nature, helps me feel focused and present. Animals and plants bring me a quiet kind of joy, even when they refuse to cooperate.

I like people who appreciate simple pleasures but still enjoy little surprises life can offer. Someone who values connection, emotional awareness, and honesty. Someone who understands that meaningful interaction takes effort but should also feel easy. I enjoy humour that sneaks up on you, conversations that wander, and quiet moments that leave an impression.

An Indiana woman will be spending the next several decades behind bars for trying to kill her stepfather with an ancient and toxic poison.

In August of this year, Ashley Nicole Jones, 32, pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder, according to court documents recently obtained by Law&Crime.

The defendant was subsequently sentenced to a total of 50 years behind bars — 25 years on each count — by Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Richard William Poynter. Jones also received nearly three years of credit for time spent in pretrial detention and good behavior.

In exchange for the defendant's guilty pleas, prosecutors dismissed one count of murder, one count of the Hoosier State's felony murder equivalent, and one additional count of attempted murder.

The victim in the case died all the same. And the efforts to get the man dead took quite awhile, as Law&Crime previously reported.

Harold ""Peanut"" Allen's obituary says he ""passed away suddenly"" at 52 on Dec. 20, 2022, in Freetown – a tiny, census-designated place located roughly 70 miles due south of Indianapolis.

But it was actually the active ingredient in antifreeze that killed him.

In October 2023, Jones confessed ""to ordering ethylene glycol off the Internet,"" according to the sheriff's office. But, the defendant insisted, her mother ""had placed the ethylene glycol in Harold's drink.""

Ethylene glycol is a clear and unscented liquid. It is often found in antifreeze and can be fatal if ingested in large quantities.

Also in October 2023, Marsha Allen, 52, passed away in her home – a death prosecutors ultimately chalked up to a suicide carried out in order to avoid being charged for her husband's murder.

The man's fatal poisoning occurred over several months the prior fall.

The plan was cooked up and executed meticulously, if haltingly, by his since-deceased wife and her daughter, according to investigatory records and court documents obtained by Law&Crime.

On Sept. 14, 2022, Jones ordered pong pong seeds from eBay.

When planted, the seeds grow into a tree that is visually similar to the equally toxic oleander. When ingested by humans, pong pong seeds can cause any number of complications — often including death.

The seeds contain the poison cerberin — and the othalanga fruit containing those seeds was used for hundreds of years in the anti-sorcery social rite known as ""tangena"" on Madagascar, according to a widely-cited and influential Harvard research paper. In this version of a so-called ""trial by ordeal,"" an offending or accused person would eat the seeds — and if they died, they were deemed a sorcerer or some other kind of criminal. If they lived, they were found innocent.

Jones and Marsha Allen received the pong pong seeds in the mail in October 2022, ground them up in a coffee grinder, and then put them in a batch of brownies on Nov. 26, 2022.

""It should be noted that Marsha (Allen) sends (Jones) a photo message of what appears to be Harold (Allen) on November 26th. In the photo, there is a half-eaten brownie on a paper plate sitting on Harold's stomach,"" one court document reads. ""Harold became sick after eating the brownie and ended up in the emergency room the next day.""

As Harold Allen slowly recuperated in and out of a hospital bed, the killers complained about the poison's effectiveness.

""I am irritated and can't sleep peacefully,"" Marsha Allen texted Jones on Nov. 28, 2022. ""I need this to be over … I wish it would reach its climax and be done lol.""

To which the woman's daughter replied: ""Agreed.""

On Nov. 30, 2022, Harold Allen returned to the emergency room but doctors chalked up his symptoms to inflammation in his intestines.

Undaunted by the man's recovery, the pair turned to a plant with an even more storied pedigree of bringing oblivion to those who ingest it. This time, Ashley Jones used Etsy to purchase hemlock — famously chosen by the philosopher Socrates to effectuate his death sentence for corrupting the youth of ancient Athens.

Technically, Marsha Allen and Jones purchased water hemlock — a version of the plant native to North America — while Socrates would have used the version native to Greece known as poison hemlock. Both versions of the plant are highly toxic and, if ingested, can cause death in exceedingly small amounts.

But Harold Allen did not die of hemlock poisoning.

On Dec. 8, 2022, the women received the second poison. Then, three times over four days, they went to work — putting hemlock in a bowl of chili on Dec. 9, 2022; in a glass of soda on Dec. 10, 2022; and in a margarita on Dec. 12, 2022.

Rasputin-like, the victim simply refused to die.

On Dec. 13, 2022, the ethylene glycol was ordered.

Several days later, Harold Allen was finally dead.

Still the murderous plot might have gone uncovered but for an entirely different crime that eventually led investigators to take a second, belated look at Harold Allen's death.

The month before Marsha Allen took her own life, the self-made widow suffered a break-in and burglary at her home.

Two men, Steven Andrew White, 29, and Nathaniel Kane Napier, 28, were arrested for the burglary. But White and Napier allegedly did not act alone — or even plan the crime. Rather, the pair ""committed the burglary at the direction of and with the assistance of Marsha's daughter Ashley Jones,"" Jackson County Sheriff Rick Meyer said.

The mother told police she suspected her daughter from the start because the alleged burglars had the combination to a gun safe. Jones was the only other person who knew that code.

But White also had a story for police: He told an investigator that not only had Jones put him and his companion up to the burglary, she said her mother had previously poisoned Harold Allen to death.

Marsha Allen denied the allegations and turned her cellphone over to law enforcement — providing investigators with telltale evidence of the conspiracy to kill her husband.

""On the cell phone, officers found text messages between Marsha and Ashley in which they discussed murdering Marsha's husband, Harold Allen, by poisoning Harold in December of 2022,"" Meyer said.

When we’re together I can physically feel my body releasing serotonin, dopamine and all the happy hormones. I mean it. If I pay attention I can feel the muscles around my eyes being in tension for my genuine happiness. What shocks me the most is that I can also feel my heart beating so fast!!! Literally. We’re just chatting and I can feel it bumping so hard in my chest and I’m like “that’s where we’re at??? Be fr girl you’re JUST TALKING”😭😭
I’m 24 yo and I’ve had a 4 years relationship with the sweetest guy but unfortunately it didn’t work out (and we broke up quite recently actually so I was also a bit disappointed when I surprised myself growing feelings for someone else so soon). So these are not my first times. But with him….i feel like a 12 years old on her first crush😭
We’re both extremely shy and introverted and he’s never had a gf or a date or anything like that, so nothing big ever happens between us. But the small “casual” touches between us are enough to make me happy: casually touching my hand when he’s showing me something or his leg resting against mine when we’re having coffee. 
After we meet when I get home I can’t stop thinking about everything we talked about and what we did. Sometimes I can’t even sleep because I can’t stop thinking about it. 
I absolutely adore how caring he is towards me. When we have coffee he always cleans up after me, at the canteen the first thing he’ll do is refilling both our glasses, if we meet before one of my classes he will walk me there just to walk all the way back by himself after, the other day I didn’t have my water bottle so I asked if I could drink from his, we was like “sure.. wait let me put some fresh water for you” and was instinctively about to pour cold water then remembered I don’t like it cold and changed the temperature without the need of me saying anything😭 idk so many small things that make me feel warm",1,1762545023.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

**Version:** 1.0 (Moon Mashup: Mealworm Microbes Meet Ice & Solein Edition)  
**Author:** @sillycowgirl (the lunar loop whisperer who dreamed regolith into ribeyes) with Grok as the first-principles fermenter (Elon axiom: Moon's your backup drive for civilization—1/6th g means 1.1x yields without the gravity tax, polar ice halves water OPEX 50% (NASA '24 analogs), and Solein air-protein flips CO₂ into 50g/day chow per colonist (Solar Foods '25). Perchlorate? Lunar regolith's milder cousin (0.1-0.5%, Apollo samples), but we sym it anyway: Bacteria respire to Cl⁻ (90% purge, USDA '24), mealworms munch waste to frass nitro (30-50% N/P/K kick, MDPI '21). Byproduct Cl⁻? Lunar gold—fert boost 15% (Enviro Wiki '22), ECLSS scrubber (2-5% O₂ amp, NASA '13), or rover grip salt (20% dust dodge, ESA '25 sims). Worms? 10-15% scraps to 1M kg protein/yr for 500K moon mavericks (Stanford '17). Data: Loops slash resupply 70% (HI-SEAS '25 lunar tweak), morale +45% (no ""eat your helmet"" blues). Rations? Retrograde. This? Alpha's eternal engine—#MoonBaseAlpha fueled by bug burps.)

**Date:** November 07, 2025  

**Mission:** Your lunar legacy, low-G locked: QOL hydro heresy for 500K moon misfits (Elon's Oct 31 vision: Starship cargo drops build permanent presence by 2035, no Apollo reruns). Uncrewed '26 (yr0: bot-bio + ice miners), scouts '28 (yr1: toxin test in Shackleton), 4 pax yr3 splash (2031 ramp to 500K by yr30). Pre-party? Auto-ag ambushes with joe + cilantro chaos. Lactic luxe (20-30% spike, gut glory). Sym surge: Bacteria + worms purge perchlorate while ice/Solein weaves methane hymns (3k tons CH4/yr, fueling 0.65 Starship hops). Sundays? Optimus sears ribeyes as digesters hum. Morale math: Symbiosis = lunar swagger (+25% life support eff, ESA '25 sims). No leaks; pure polar perpetuity.

## Core Philosophy: Atoms to Apogee – Symbiosis That Slays Lunar Lag
- **First-Principles Feast Loop:** Moon murders momentum—low g (1/6th Earth) boosts hydro 1.1x (McKinsey '25 microgravity multipliers), but perchlorate (0.1-0.5%) still sneers at sprouts. Sym fix: Bacteria respire ClO₄⁻ to Cl⁻ (innocent ions for fert/bleach/fuel, Mohr's titration UNL '25), mealworms devour organics (50 mg waste/day/100 larvae, Stanford '17), pooping frass that amps soil 20-40% (MDPI '21). Overlap? Venn of vacuum victory: Bacteria handle toxins, worms enrich aftermath—shared waste + Solein (CO₂ to protein, 50g/day/person) yields purged plots + air-chow. Scale? 500K oddballs (carnivore cosmonauts to vegan voids) get 23 kcal/day fresh, loops recycling 85% N/P/K (Battelle '25). Optimus? Logs prefs, stirs soups—efficiency eternal. Cl⁻ cherry: Electrolysis to Cl₂/NaOH for plastics, or HCl propellant (SpaceX synergy, ND '13). Value add? Sym loops crank eff +20% over baseline hydro (less space, more sauce—70% resupply cut, HI-SEAS '25 lunar adj), turning ice OPEX slash (50%) into 300% fuel ROI—$10M in becomes $30M out by yr5, because who needs Earth UPS when your poop's the payload?
- **Variety Vortex 1.0:** Micros mulch; berries brew; flowers flirt; grains/legumes grind; herbs/heat hurl. Sym spin: Worms + bugs + Solein boost +20% (ice water halves thirst, air protein fills gaps). Footprint: 500 m² (4 pax) → 5 km² (500K, Starship x100 flights). Output: 9k kg/yr small → 200M kg/yr mega, 23 kcal/day (lactic/loop lift = 55% DV vits). Starship sync: Methane from mealworm middens + ice LOX powers returns—poop to polar propulsion.

## Symbiotic Spotlight: Bacteria + Mealworms + Solein – Lunar Low-G Tag-Team
Bacterial byproduct (Cl⁻) feeds the loop: Fert for quinoa (15% yield pop), ECLSS scrubber (2-5% O₂ co-boost), rover grip salt (20% dust dodge). Mealworms? Waste warriors—convert scraps to protein, frass to fert, closing circles 70% tighter (HI-SEAS '25). Solein? Air alchemist—CO₂ + H₂O → 50g protein/day, slashing import 40% (Solar Foods '25). Venn vibe: Bacteria purge (90% ClO₄⁻ gone), worms enrich (30% soil N kick), Solein supplements (air to amino)—overlap? Shared organics + ice yield chloride-safe chow for 500K quirks, value add: +25% total eff (loops turn baseline 17.6 kg/m² to 21.8 kg/m², 24% resupply ROI boost—sym's the secret sauce making $10M scale pay 3x in 5 years). (Your Venn visual: Silver bacterial circle (Cl⁻ icons orbiting), gold mealworm (frass/protein bars), blue Solein (CO₂ arrows to protein nuggets)—green overlap pulsing with CH₄ flames, fueling 3k tons/yr Starship hops. Labels: ""95% Purge"" left, ""50 mg Waste/Day"" right, ""50g Air Protein/Day"" bottom, ""300% Fuel ROI"" center. Low-G glow: 1.1x yield halo.)

## Phased Crop Rollout: Lunar Low-G Seeds
Yr0-2: Uncrewed unpack (70% auto, microbe/mealworm inoculants + ice drills purge perchlorate). Yr3: Sym swarm. Yields hydro-hewn (ISS/vert-farm 85% eff; loops +20% via worm frass, low-g 1.1x). Roulette? Regolith-remediated, ice-infused.

(Simple Bar Graph Description: X-axis categories spike like Starship stacks—Sweet/Caff bar low at 138kg (joe jolt, ice-cooled), Veggies tower 3300kg (low-g lunacy), Berries mid 743kg (lactic laughs), Grains 1760kg (quinoa quaff), Flowers 688kg (petal purge), Leg/Star 1540kg (root riches), Herbs 990kg (cilantro chaos).

- **Sweeteners/Caffeine:** Stevia (ClO₄⁻ slurper, 70% bioaccum), Arabica joe. Buzz + toxin takedown; ice CO₂ feeds brew. Pre-Land (0). Yield: 2.2-3.3 Stevia; 1.1-2.2 Coffee kg/m²/yr (1.1x low-g). Quip: Coffee nukes perchlorate sunrises—500K cups entropy's eclipse.
- **Veggies (High Variety):** Microgreens, lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, bell peppers, cucumbers, radishes, poblanos, jalapeños. Nutrient novas: Peppers purge 50% ClO₄⁻; worm frass + Solein cranks cycles. Early (3). Yield: 22-33 kg/m²/yr. Quip: Jalapeños hate toxins—spice for 500K cyborgs.
- **Berries (Antioxidant Bombs):** Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries. Polyphenol purge: Scraps to lactic vinegar (20-30% boost) + digester/mealworm feed (0.2 kg CH4/kg). Early (3). Yield: 5.5-11 kg/m²/yr. Quip: Berry the perchlorate—500K bowls loop's lunar laugh.
- **Low-Process Grains:** Quinoa (ClO₄⁻ pro, 85% remediate), amaranth, millet. Pseudograin purge: Waste N nitro-boosts. Pre-Land (0). Yield: 16.5-27.5 kg/m²/yr. Quip: Quinoa drains Moon's dust—500K flatbreads fuel fleet.
- **Edible Flowers:** Nasturtium (ClO₄⁻ champ, 60% hyperaccum), borage, violets, calendula. Pigment purge: Petals pickle in Cl⁻ vinegar. Early (3). Yield: 11-16.5 kg/m²/yr. Quip: Flowers biofilter—500K petals petal to polar.
- **Legumes & Starches:** Sweet potatoes (75% root soak), lentils, chickpeas. Macro munch: Pulses fix N from worm frass. Early (3). Yield: 16.5-27.5 kg/m²/yr. Quip: Chickpeas loop de lunar—500K hummus from your ""crater twist.""
- **Herbs (Flavor Forge):** Cilantro (40% chelator), basil, mint, thyme, dill. Aroma accum: Infuses Cl⁻ zing. Early (3). Yield: 27.5-38.5 kg/m²/yr. Quip: Cilantro trolls toxins—500K herbs enthusiasm or bland bust.

**Sunday Cookout Codex: Optimus' Lunar Sear**  
Yr3+ warp-weekly: 1.5 kg ribeyes/4 (waste-fed vats, Cl⁻-clean iron). Optimus: 130°F medium-rare memory, induction inferno. Vibe: Earthrise fiddles, purge toasts. Scale: 500K Sundays? 75k kg ribeyes/yr, mealworm methane fuels fleet. Metric: 40% cohesion (loops last laugh).

- **Ribeyes Grilled Like You Like It:** Optimus recalls—450°F cross-hatch, Cl⁻-free poblano rub. Worm-waste biogas grills green. 500 kcal/plate, 30g protein. Quip: ""Overcook? I'd RUD recharge.""
- **Candied Sweet Taters:** Purge roots (1kg/4, ClO₄⁻-clean), stevia-glazed (Cl⁻ vinegar tang), amaranth cinnamon. 200g/serving, 150 kcal, vit A vault. Osmosis seals 6-mo. Wit: Sweeter than Starship—loops",0,1762544613.0,spaceflight,0,0.25,False

# Weather & Weekend's Outlook:

Rain's moving in late today with those gusty winds potentially hitting 45mph in the Champlain Valley. Saturday morning showers clear out for a pleasant afternoon in the low 50s with partial sun - your best bet for outdoor activities.

1or43j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Decorfurnist/comments/1or43j5/how_to_fill_empty_space_in_the_middle_of_a_room/,How to fill empty space in the middle of a room?,"Filling empty space in the middle of a room can completely change how the space feels—more cozy, balanced, and functional. The key is choosing something that fits your room’s size, purpose, and style. Here are practical, stylish ideas you can use:

**✅ 1. Add a Statement Rug**

If the center feels empty, a large rug instantly anchors the whole room.  
It creates a “visual foundation” without adding clutter.

**Best for:** living rooms, bedrooms, open spaces.

**✅ 2. Place a Coffee Table or Center Table**

A coffee table is the most classic way to fill the middle naturally.

**Try:**

* A round wood or glass table
* A modern marble table
* A large ottoman with a tray

Round tables work especially well in small spaces.

**✅ 3. Create a Seating Cluster**

If the room is large, fill the center with functional seating.

Options:

* Accent chairs facing each other
* A loveseat
* Two poufs or floor cushions
* A small bench

This makes the room feel inviting and balanced.

**✅ 4. Add a Large Indoor Plant**

A tall plant creates height and fills vertical space beautifully.

Great choices:

* Fiddle leaf fig
* Areca palm
* Snake plant cluster

Use a stylish pot for design impact.

**✅ 5. Use a Console or Narrow Table**

In long rooms or hallways, a slim console table in the center area adds structure without blocking movement.

**✅ 6. Add a Stylish Ottoman or Poufs**

Ottomans fill space AND offer extra seating or a footrest.

Choose:

* A single oversized ottoman
* Two small poufs
* A low upholstered bench

Perfect for cozy, modern, or minimalist rooms.

**✅ 7. Place a Sculptural Piece**

If you prefer a minimalist approach, one bold decorative item can fill the space elegantly.

Ideas:

* A sculpture
* A tall vase
* A pedestal with artwork
* A modern floor lamp

This works beautifully in contemporary homes.

**✅ 8. Create a Reading Nook**

If you have extra space in a bedroom or living room:

Add:

* A comfy chair
* A small side table
* A warm lamp

It fills the space and adds functionality.

**✅ 9. Use a Round Dining Table (if the room allows)**

In large kitchens or open layouts, a round table in the middle creates a natural gathering point.

**✅ 10. Add a Floor Lamp for Vertical Interest**

A tall floor lamp fills empty center space visually without physically occupying much space.

Works especially well in corners that spill into the center.",1,1762544442.0,Decorfurnist,0,1.0,False

1or411h,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1or411h/29m_brazil_looking_for_calm_genuine_friendships/,"29M Brazil Looking for calm, genuine friendships","Hey! I'm 29M, from Bahia Brazil. I've been feeling pretty isolated lately and missing real human connection, so I thought I'd give this another shot. Looking for people who enjoy meaningful conversations and aren't afraid of a little emotional depth.

**Things I'm into:** I'm pretty nerdy about sci-fi (movies, series, concepts), technology, and space exploration  I can easily fall into YouTube rabbit holes about these topics. I love movie and game soundtracks, rainy days, and quiet mornings. I'm fascinated by different cultures, especially Asian and Nordic ones. I'm obsessed with cats even though I don't have one yet. I value deep conversations over small talk, and I'm more of a tea and documentaries person than coffee and parties.

**My vibe:** I enjoy calm, thoughtful conversations that flow naturally between topics  I can spend hours talking about life, problems, random thoughts, world issues, or just sharing weird memes. My mind jumps around a lot (thanks ADHD), so our conversations might go from scifi to personal stuff to current events in minutes, and that's just how I think. I'm not introverted or extroverted, somewhere in between. I live pretty simply and I'm currently rebuilding my routine and focusing on self-improvement. I'm centrist politically with some conservative views, but I'm not looking for debates  just mutual respect and understanding.

**What I'm looking for:** Someone around 20-34 who's emotionally available and has time for genuine, consistent connection. I value regular communication and mutual effort  life happens and I totally understand if you need to disappear for a bit (storms, no power, busy days), just a heads up would be appreciated. I'm not glued to my phone 24/7, but I don't want conversations that fade after a few messages either. Open to voice/video calls once we're comfortable. Would love to find someone to watch series with, study alongside, or just exist quietly together sometimes. Friendship is where everything begins, and if something deeper grows naturally from it, that would be wonderful.

If you're interested, please tell me a bit about yourself instead of just ""hi""  what do you enjoy? What's been on your mind lately?

Fair warning: sometimes I might seem serious or blunt, but I promise it's not intentional. Just how I communicate. My English isn't perfect either, but I'm doing my best here.",1,1762544284.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I wanted to share a little story from last week, maybe someone here can relate.

I was sitting in my favorite coffee shop, guitar in hand, noodling with some chord progressions I’d been working on. I wasn’t really aiming for anything serious, just passing time. But then, a guy at the next table started tapping his coffee cup in this weird rhythm, and it somehow synced perfectly with what I was playing.

I laughed, we made eye contact, and without really planning it, we started jamming together. It was messy and chaotic, but also kind of magical. By the end of my coffee, we’d accidentally written a full little song, lyrics, melody, and all.

It got me thinking about how collaboration can come from the most unexpected places. You don’t always need a studio or a scheduled session, sometimes it’s about being open and listening to the world around you.

Has anyone else ever had a random collaboration turn into something real? I’d love to hear your stories, maybe we can even start a thread of spontaneous jam ideas that anyone can pick up and expand on.",0,1762544240.0,musicians,4,0.31,False

I did the typical recruitment route, including endless coffee chats and LinkedIn research on the person I was chatting with, which led to a summer internship and finally the coveted banking job. I stayed for 5 years because I didn't know what else was out there, and the grind prevented me from fully leaving.

What I wish I knew is that there's ***so much more*** to finance, and a lot more exciting stuff, than just banking or consulting. And a lot have comparable pay.

After being burned by the corporate world more than a few times and watching my friends and co-workers experience the same career difficulties, I decided to build something that could genuinely help. It's a career tool based on real data that shows you genuine possibilities in the job market tailored to you in terms of skills, interests, and values. 

A lot of my friends make high incomes but have since realized they want other things now besides maximizing salary. Similarly, a lot of my finance friends now want more creative paths. This tool addresses all of these situations and more by giving you real data in a tailored way to help you make the most informed decisions.

If I had this, I probably wouldn't have done banking for five years. It was honestly soul sucking, but I didn't know what else was out there. The business school I went to pushed linear careers i.e. banking and consulting onto students. There's way more out there that I learned about only after years working in the industry, like revops, growth, corp dev, and strategic finance.

If this is something that you're interested in, sign up here: [findyour.stream](http://findyour.stream/?source=redditfinancestudentshub)

It's still an early version. Right now I'm mostly trying to validate the idea first and see if people actually find this helpful. You can try it out and provide honest feedback. 

By all means, if banking is truly your calling, go for it! I'm just trying to provide more context and information for those who weren't given the entire picture before deciding.

While they are more common in kittens, adult cats can also be affected.

Ep 109:  She wants answers, he gives her the cold shoulder, leading her to wrap things up quickly and rushing out, then comes the infamous 'trapped between the door and Eunhyeok' moment which has been romanticized by the artist, stans as well as the official comic sites. (whilst there's nothing to be romanticized here- she looks heartbroken. )

Ep 114: He just 'shows up' when she's drunk and is questioning if his love for her was real and of course, she's vulnerable, and emotional at the time. (Again.)

Ep 115: The girl literally says that she wants to drop documents at his house voluntarily even when her boss tells her it's not necessary, completely uncharacteristic and unlike her recently established stance- aka wanting to set boundaries. And then we see the 'don't go scene' ( impulsive and generic) 

Ep 119: A cockroach, seriously?— When was it even established she was scared of them, and literally the whole 'jumping' wasn't realistic at all. It seems like something you'd see in a silly comedy movie. Which leads to the 'heartbeat' scene. ( I'm not sure what to call this, but poor writing )

And then Su-ae later approaches Eunhyeok herself, and gets inside the car 😮‍💨 ( Of course, the woman needs saving, and there's literally no one else she can call.)

Once I had it, I needed to let out a scream of frustrated rage that I don’t have book 4.

I will avoid spoilers as best I can, beyond what can be found on the back of the book.

Things are coming full circle; this book takes place entirely within Alt Coulomb. The King in Red has convened his conference of the Powers That Be (and the Powers That Do Not Be are invited too, of course) to plan an alliance to deal with the coming threat from beyond the stars. Only through unity, Craftsmen and Pantheons working together, is there any hope of surviving what’s coming.

Of course the flaw in this is that literally everyone who has enough power for a seat at the table got there by fighting each other for it, and maneuvering for power and position between the fights. Tara and company are asking them to change the habits of a lifetime, or life*times* for many of them. It’s not at all clear that they are capable of this; a leopard cannot change his spots. Even if they are, it’s certainly clear that they’re more concerned about each other, and making sure when the crisis is passed they are the ones to come out of it in the best position.

Meanwhile everyone smiles, attends presentations, complains about the length of the line at Muerte Coffee, and the actual work takes place in backrooms and informal settings.

But all of that is background. I was here for the people. Tara, and Caleb, and Abelard, and Kai, and Izza, and Mal, and Dawn (yes, definitely including Dawn) and all the rest we’ve collected over the books. As far as they’re concerned, this book was very, very frustrating, but in a good way. I care about them all; they generally care about each other (some don’t really know each other, like, say, Abelard and Mal, but still). And it’s frustrating when them being true to themselves and their convictions leads to them being on different sides, despite their mutual respect and common goals.

It all works. It all makes sense for the characters. It’s upsetting and frustrating to read.

And, as before, *damn it Tara you don’t have to do everything yourself*. Yes, that is still a character flaw. No, I did not expect otherwise.

So yeah. Frustrating, but the frustration of a well-crafted novel and well-realized characters coming into necessary conflict.

Fair warning: I am extremely *un*-satisfied with the ending, because it ends on a cliffhanger. Everything is coming to the end, one way or another. Extremely impatient for book 4.

1or3t1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1or3t1d/dont_ever_look_into_the_spinning_cube/,Don’t Ever Look Into the Spinning Cube,"“Take a look at this, Rob,” Lee said as he set the strange, little, metallic object on the table in front of me.


It was a small metal cube, like a die, except its top came to a slight point. In the center, a tiny sphere sat—something like a miniature wind spinner.
I gave Lee a questioning look. I had no idea what the hell he’d just put down in front of me.
Was this the “big deal” he’d dragged me over for after work?


“And what exactly is it?” I broke the silence when I realized even Lee didn’t seem to know what to say.


“I’m not exactly sure,” he admitted, scratching the back of his head, “but I’ll show you soon. We just need to get ready.”


“Ready for what?” I asked, still wearing my annoyed expression.


Lee and I had been friends forever. I knew him. Too well. He’d dragged me into more stupid crap than I could count—most of the times we got in trouble back in high school had been because of his ideas. And judging by that familiar look on his face, he was up to something bad again.


“So, this thing,” Lee said, sitting down across from me on the couch, “it’s something really special.”


“Lee,” I sighed tiredly, “it’s a metal cube with a spinning thing in the middle. Don’t waste my time.”


“Wait, wait, Rob,” he said quickly as I started to stand up. “Just give me a minute, okay? Please.”


“Lee,” I sighed again, “I’ve got a lot to do at home. I don’t have time for this right now.”


“One minute,” he said, raising a finger. “Just one minute, and I’ll show you something amazing.”


I let out a heavy breath and dropped back into Lee’s armchair. Fine, I thought. One minute couldn’t hurt.

A wide grin spread across Lee’s face; he practically glowed with excitement. Then, carefully, he set the silver cube in the middle of the table so we could both see the tiny, shining sphere resting at its center.
He reached out and gave it a light flick with his fingertip. The little sphere began to spin on its axis, turning like a tiny weather vane.
And I just stared, mesmerized.


I just stared at the spinning little silver sphere. It kept turning and turning, unstoppable. The light from the lamps shimmered brilliantly across its surface.
It gave me the feeling that it was spinning faster and faster. Maybe it actually was. I watched it, holding my breath, afraid to even move.
Why it felt so good, I couldn’t have said—but it did.
The whole thing had the same pull as the moment before something wonderful happens.
Not fear. Not anxiety.
More like when a kid waits for Christmas morning… or when you’re about to see your parents after years apart.

And then I felt it. Deep inside.

Like the most beautiful thing in the world had suddenly bloomed inside me.
A wave of peace washed over me—but not the kind you get when you curl up with your favorite movie on a cold winter night.
This was deeper.
The kind of peace that makes the world around you freeze, makes you wish this moment—this exact feeling—could last forever.

The little sphere no longer spun.
It flickered instead—moving so fast it had become a single blur of light.
And in that glow, I saw what must have been the source of that warmth… of that impossible happiness.

A breathtaking place unfolded before me. The sun was bright and gentle, the breeze carried the sweet scent of flowers. It was like a perfect dream—one you’d want to live in forever.

Then a melody rose.
Tiny bells chiming softly, delicately, their sound just right—soothing to the ears, comforting to the soul.
I felt myself lifting off the ground, soaring among the clouds, resting on the soft, endless sky.


“Jesus Christ! What the fuck!” Lee shouted angrily.


That snapped me back to reality. My eyes burned—I thought they might burst right out of my skull. It felt like I’d been staring into a TV screen for hours, far too close, without blinking.
But it wasn’t my eyes that hurt the most. It was my soul.

It felt like my childhood dog had just died… and I knew I could never be happy again— not unless I could look at that spinning thing one more time.


“Rob!” Lee yelled. “Rob! Snap out of it! It’s nine in the morning!”


“What… what?” I croaked, my mouth dry. “Morning? What do you mean, morning?”


The morning sunlight really was shining through Lee’s windows. But how the hell could it be morning—when I’d come over late in the afternoon, and I’d only been here for a few minutes?


“Rob, come on already!” Lee urged again.


We were heading toward the elevator, but I was still wrestling with my coat as we walked.


“Goddamn it, I’m late—so fucking late!” Lee kept grumbling, his voice sharp with panic.


“You’re telling me?” I snapped, stepping into the elevator. “What the hell did you do to us, Lee? Why the fuck do you always have to drag me into this kind of bullshit?”


“I don’t know, Rob… I really don’t know,” Lee muttered, sounding guilty.


When the elevator doors opened, he only paused long enough to mumble another quick apology before bolting toward his car.
I headed for mine.
At that point, it didn’t matter if I was one hour late or two—I was in a lousy mood anyway.

The whole day was a complete mess.
I felt… empty, like something inside me was missing. Like I’d lost something important, something I couldn’t name.
I don’t usually smoke much, but today I went outside at least eight times, just to take the edge off that emptiness. It didn’t help.
If anything, the exhaustion made it worse. I must’ve stared at that damn thing all night—and now only coffee was keeping me alive.

That afternoon, Lee called me.
He apologized again, saying he had no idea what had happened. He said he’d just been staring at the thing, and the next thing he knew, it was morning and his boss was blowing up his phone, wondering where the hell he was.

I believed his story.
I knew he wasn’t telling me everything, but honestly, I didn’t care.
Nothing really mattered that day anyway.

But when he asked if I wanted to come over again that evening…
I said yes without a second thought.


I was sipping a tall glass of cold beer. I’d brought it for Lee when I arrived.

He was already buzzing with excitement. He’d set everything up—water, snacks, soft pillows on the couch and in the armchair. It felt like he was preparing for something.


“Lee?” I asked after another sip. “What the hell is that thing?”


Lee just smiled warmly and offered me a bag of chips. I took a handful.


“This,” he said, lifting a finger dramatically, “this, my dear Robert… is the gateway to happiness.”


I rolled my eyes again.
Lee could be so damn theatrical it made my skin crawl. But still… something tickled at the back of my mind. What if he was telling the truth?


“You don’t believe me?” he asked with a friendly scowl. “Wasn’t yesterday’s little demonstration enough for you?”


“I—I don’t know,” I lied, to him and to myself. “I don’t even know what I saw.”


Lee gave me that knowing smile, then jumped up from the couch.
He opened one of the cabinets and took out the little silver cube again. He placed it on the coffee table with the care of someone handling a sacred relic.

I couldn’t take my eyes off the thing. I kept stealing glances at it like it was some kind of miracle, finishing the last of my beer without even realizing.


“What the hell is it, Lee?” I asked, swallowing hard. “Where did you even get it?”


Lee chuckled and flopped back down onto the couch.


“I have no idea, Rob,” he said with a shrug. “Picked it up at the flea market downtown.”


“And what are we even seeing in there?” I pressed.


“I don’t know,” he repeated, “but it’s something beautiful. Feels like pure happiness… like looking straight through the gates of heaven.”


I listened to him, deep in thought. Lee could be convincing when he wanted to be. But something about the way he talked—about the way that thing felt—made me uneasy.
The little spinner really was the most incredible thing I’d ever seen… but now it scared me a little too.


“Lee,” I interrupted his rambling, “how long have you been watching that thing?”


Lee’s face darkened.


“I… uh… a few weeks,” he stammered. “At first, I wanted to keep it to myself, you know? But then I started to feel like… others needed to see it too.”


“Maybe we shouldn’t be doing this anymore,” I said, unsettled by his words.


“Rob, please,” Lee said nervously. “Just once more. Watch it with me, and you’ll understand. Just once.”


I hesitated. I wanted to see it again—to hear the chiming, see the light, feel that perfect, blissful warmth again.
But I was afraid.

In the end, it didn’t matter. Before I could even answer, Lee had already moved.
He flicked the little sphere with his fingertip—and it began to spin once more.


The little silver sphere spun again.
The light shimmered across its surface, blurred and dazzling, and a wave of pure bliss washed over me.
It was heavenly—ecstatic. Just like before.
It felt as if gentle hands were stroking my soul, as if every perfect moment of my life were happening all at once.

Tiny lights glittered like the first rays of dawn— beauty made tangible, paradise brought to earth. I couldn’t take my eyes off it. The lights grew brighter, softer, more perfect.
And then the bells came again, their golden chime so sweet you could listen to them for the rest of your life. They rang softly, peacefully, as if they were playing right there around me.

I could see it now.
A radiant place, filled with light. A massive golden gate, shining so brilliantly you’d want to curl up at its base and live there forever.
I just stared, lost, unable to look away. My soul drifted high above the clouds. The golden gate loomed before my eyes.

Then—something changed.
Dark clouds began to gather, slowly covering the gate.
I strained to see, desperate to hold on to that beauty, that perfect joy, but it was fading.
Black clouds surrounded me. The sweet scent of the breeze turned foul, reeking of decay.
And still, I couldn’t look away from the spinning device.
I just kept staring.

The chimes grew fainter and fainter until they were gone— replaced by the sound of crying.
Screaming.
Then came a low, rumbling voice, growling words I couldn’t understand.

I came to when someone shook me gently.


“Sir, what happened?” a stranger’s voice said. “Are you okay?”


My vision was blurry; I could only make out vague shapes in the room. I was choking, my body locked tight, every muscle twisted into a cramp. I couldn’t move. People were shouting, but I could barely hear what they said. My ears rang. The world spun around me.


“Paramedics are here!” someone yelled. “Everyone, move aside!”


Paramedics? I thought, confused.
Then everything went dark, and my mind sank deep into the void.


I woke up in a daze.
It felt like a veil had been draped over my eyes—everything was hazy, melting together into shapeless blurs.


“Ah, finally awake,” said an unfamiliar voice.


“W-where…?” I croaked. “Where am I?”


“You’re in the hospital, Mr. Robert,” said a woman’s voice. “Can you tell me what you and your friend took?”


“What? Took?” I muttered, my mouth dry as sandpaper.


“I’m your doctor, Robert,” she continued calmly. “You were brought here two days ago—both you and your friend. You’re lucky the building manager had to check your friend’s apartment, or you both would’ve died there.”


“What? What happened?” I tried to speak clearly, but my mind was foggy, and my body felt like it had been packed inside a heavy sack.


They kept me in the hospital.
I had no idea what to say—or even how to explain any of it. The doctors didn’t seem to understand much either. We were severely dehydrated, showing all the signs of having sat motionless for days.
Lee was the same—only his condition was worse. They had to keep him in a medically induced coma.

Days passed. My vision slowly returned, and my mind began to piece things together.
I could move again, mostly on my own. I still needed a cane, but at least I could walk.

But the craving stayed. It never went away. I wanted to see it again. Just once.
Just one more glimpse of the light.
And as it turned out, Lee felt the same way— because Lee had vanished from the hospital.
Without a trace.


I knew where Lee had gone. Back to his apartment. Back for the device.
He wanted it for himself—just like he’d said. Rage boiled in my chest. I couldn’t believe my best friend would try to cheat me. That bastard Lee wanted the spinner all to himself.

I lasted one more day in the hospital. The doctor wasn’t happy about me leaving, but I couldn’t stay. The thought of Lee taking that thing somewhere, hiding it away where I’d never see it again—it terrified me.

I took a cab to Lee’s place. Slipped the driver fifty extra bucks just to make him go as fast as he could. Walking was hard; I hobbled my way up to Lee’s apartment.

The door was unlocked. The handle turned easily, and I stepped inside.

The place was chaos.
Furniture overturned, the room a complete wreck. The couch still held the faint imprint where we’d sat for days, staring at the spinning silver marvel.
Only two pieces of furniture were left standing: the armchair—where Lee now sat—and the coffee table, where the little silver miracle rested.


“Lee,” I said when I saw him sitting there. “Jesus, Lee… I thought you’d run off with it.”


But Lee didn’t answer. 
I moved closer.

The silver device lay on the table. The little sphere wasn’t spinning this time, but the whole thing seemed to pulse, faintly. Lee’s head had fallen back, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.

I stepped right up to him, and froze.

Lee’s gray, lifeless body had sunk deep into the chair. His skin was burned, scorched black in places. Where his eyes had been were now hollow, charred pits.
Lee was dead.

I didn’t say a word. Just stared at him, emotionless.
Oddly enough, I felt calm.
More annoyed than horrified—annoyed that I’d thought Lee might have taken the device.

But now that he was dead…

Palestinians debate saying no to Israeli products amid economic ties,"# With calls to boycott Israel increasing globally, Palestinians discuss the consequences of the campaign on their own lives.

[An illustrative image of Palestinian laborers working on a construction project in Israel.\(photo credit: Menahem Kahana\/AFP via Getty Images\)](https://preview.redd.it/m604rznezvzf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=52aa2c6ed42ce208ce24cfcdf3f8ecfc1a96aa7e)

Israel’s Elite brand of dark coffee is Ahmed Qasrawi’s favorite. Every morning, he drinks a cup of the potent beverage with a splash of Israeli-made Tnuva milk. These aren’t the only Israeli products in the cabinets of his home in the West Bank city of Hebron.

“We also have Osem and Alma biscuits,” he told *The Jerusalem Report* in a recent interview, referring to two other Israeli brands widely sold in Palestinian towns and cities across the territory. 

As [global calls to boycott Israel](https://www.jpost.com/bds-threat/article-826696) over its actions in Gaza have grown increasingly loud over the past two years, some Palestinians, like Qasrawi, a father of six, reject the idea outright.

“What’s the point? It doesn’t help or do any good. I don’t see anyone around me boycotting Israeli items. Everything \[between Israelis and Palestinians\] is mixed together – the economy, our lives – it’s all connected,” he said.

“We live here together. We share a lot of things. We sell goods to Israelis; we buy goods from Israelis. I don’t really see any reason to boycott one another,” the 47-year-old continued. “If you walk around supermarkets here, you can see many Israeli brands.”

# Intertwined economically

For decades, even as the Israeli–Palestinian conflict raged and wars erupted, daily life – and the economy – have remained deeply intertwined.

Qasrawi, who worked in construction in Beersheba before the war in Gaza erupted following [Hamas’s October 7, 2023, terror attack](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-872574), views any move to sever ties with Israel as both impractical and extremely damaging. Past boycott efforts targeting products made in Israeli settlements have already threatened thousands of Palestinians employed in West Bank industrial zones, placing their livelihoods in jeopardy.

Since October 7, Israel has barred [Palestinian laborers](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-782153) like Qasrawi from entering the country for work.

For two years, he, like many other Palestinians, has struggled to find a stable income. Today, he earns just NIS 2,200 a month working part time in Hebron – far less than the NIS 14,000 he once made in Israel. The loss of income forced his daughter to drop out of university because he can no longer afford the tuition.

# The boycott debate

The question of whether boycotting Israel helps or harms Palestinians remains deeply divisive across the West Bank.

Supporters view it as part of the struggle for rights and self-determination – a form of peaceful resistance aimed at ending what they call “the occupation.”

The [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-849543), co-founded in 2005 by Palestinian activist Omar Barghouti of Ramallah, took this concept further, expanding from consumer boycotts to targeting Israel in culture, academia, and investment.

Barghouti and other key Palestinian figures in the movement did not respond to The Jerusalem Report’s requests for comment.

Critics in Israel and abroad accuse BDS of fueling antisemitism – a charge activists deny – and of refusing to recognize Israel’s legitimacy as a Jewish state. During the Israel-Hamas War, the boycott movement gained unprecedented global traction, influencing politics, business, and culture. Some believe that it was influential in isolating Israel diplomatically and also in the recent wave of countries deciding to recognize a Palestinian state.

# Applying pressure

They also say the boycott movement played a part in US President Donald Trump’s success in brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to end the fighting in Gaza. Khalil Abu Karsh, a Palestinian researcher from the West Bank, disagrees.

“We cannot say that the breakthrough was solely the result of pressure from the boycott movement. Its activities may have laid the groundwork over two decades, but in the end the game changer was the scenes coming out of Gaza,” he told the Report.

“The world saw the difficult images of children in the media, and that marked the turning point. Without the war in Gaza, their efforts wouldn’t have been that effective,” Abu Karsh said, adding, “What made Israel’s isolation grow were statements from far-right ministers in the Israeli government and the pressure European leaders felt from their constituencies.

“Public opinion in America has also changed in favor of ending the war, and it seems the administration has started to feel that Israel’s isolation may harm America’s interests in the Middle East,” he added.

Abu Karsh also rejects the boycott strategy, arguing that it has little resonance among ordinary Palestinians.

“I don’t see how it helps us. Israel controls the tax revenues and daily life of Palestinians,” he said.

“Boycotting is unwise. It has negative results because it makes it seem as if all Palestinians are radicals, just as some people assume all Israelis are far-right extremists,” Abu Karsh said. “There has to be dialogue between the two sides if we want real solutions.”

He added that “when workers are prevented from holding jobs in Israel and cannot provide for their families, some may be pushed to radical actions such as boycotting.”

# No official policy

Former general Habis Al-Shrouf, director of the Palestine Institute for National Security Research, said boycotting Israeli products was not an official Palestinian Authority policy but rather a personal choice. “The boycott was a reaction to settlers’ conduct in the West Bank, and then to the war in Gaza. It was a means of soft power, not a goal – intended to urge Israel to change its policy toward the Palestinian people,” he said.

“I believe that boycott initiatives will simply go away if there is peace and a political solution based on two states.”

Economic data show that roughly half of Palestinian imports to the West Bank and Gaza come from Israel, and more than 80% of Palestinian exports go to Israeli markets. “There is interdependence, and Israel is the largest trading partner of the Palestinians, so boycotting doesn’t serve either side,” said Abu Mahmoud, a Palestinian labor activist.

“We would prefer to get our jobs back in Israel; but after two years of restrictions, many had to look for alternatives in the Palestinian local market,” he added. Responding to calls for greater economic independence from Israel, Abu Mahmoud said Palestinian authorities have begun offering easier loans for small business ventures. But, he cautioned, “It helps, but it’s not enough. For this to be stable, there needs to be international support.”

“It’s not our priority, but because of the difficult circumstances we’re in, I think that if this situation continues, there may be no choice but to try to build an independent economy.

“Some workers have started their own projects in the West Bank. So those involved in small businesses may not support importing from Israel the same products they now produce themselves,” Abu Mahmoud said, adding, “That’s why we have to strengthen ventures run by merchants and support local markets. I don’t call it \[a\] boycott; it’s about our survival.”■

1or3saw,https://www.reddit.com/r/grok/comments/1or3saw/grok_hallucinates_or_lies_better_than_humans/,Grok “hallucinates” or lies better than humans,"I was asking grok if the gov shutdown is over and pretty much it told me it was with proof, pictures, phone numbers to contact to verify, detailed timelines. After I told it that it was still shutdown it told me it made it all up and it continued to lie about why it lied to start with. Crazy (and funny) stuff. 

Me: Why is the government shutdown?

The U.S. federal government is currently in a partial shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, when Congress failed to pass appropriations for fiscal year 2026. As of today (November 4, 2025), it has lasted 35 days—tying the 2018–2019 shutdown for the longest in U.S. history—and is set to break that record tonight. ￼ ￼
Why It Happened
•  Core dispute: Democrats in the Senate refuse to pass a “clean” short-term funding bill (a continuing resolution, or CR) unless Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium subsidies that are scheduled to expire December 31, 2025. Without them, millions of Americans face sharp increases in health-insurance costs. ￼ ￼
•  Republican position: The GOP-controlled House passed a clean CR that would fund the government at current levels until November 21, 2025. Republicans insist they will not negotiate policy changes while the government is closed and blame Democrats for “hostage-taking.” ￼
•  Senate math: Even though Republicans hold a 53–47 majority, the senate’s 60-vote filibuster rule lets Democrats block the House CR. The bill has failed 14 times (most recently today, 54–44). 1 4 
What’s Shut Down
	•	700,000+ federal workers furloughed; another ~730,000 “essential” employees (TSA, air-traffic controllers, Border Patrol, etc.) are working without pay.
	•	National parks, museums, and most federal offices are closed.
	•	SNAP (food stamps) for 42 million people was cut to 50 % for November after two federal judges ordered the USDA to tap a $5.25 billion contingency fund; full benefits normally cost $8–9 billion/month. 3 
	•	Head Start, flood-insurance processing, and new VA claims are frozen or delayed.
	•	Over 3.2 million airline passengers have faced delays or cancellations because of staffing shortages. 12 
Latest Signs of Progress
	•	Bipartisan back-channel talks among rank-and-file senators (e.g., Sens. Gary Peters (D-MI) and Mike Rounds (R-SD)) are gaining steam.
	•	Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said today he is “optimistic” the shutdown could end this week; the next CR deadline would likely be pushed to December or January. 11 
	•	President Trump has invited all 53 GOP senators to the White House for breakfast tomorrow (Nov. 5). 6 
Bottom Line
The shutdown is a pure partisan standoff over health-care costs. Democrats want a guarantee that ACA subsidies won’t expire; Republicans want Democrats to reopen the government first. Polls show most Americans blame Republicans and Trump, but both sides now see political risk in letting the record-breaking shutdown drag on. 12
If nothing changes by tomorrow, the U.S. will wake up to the longest government shutdown ever. Keep an eye on the Senate vote tally and any White House statement after tomorrow’s breakfast—those will be the clearest signals of whether a deal is finally near.

Me: How could you jump the gun? You had time lines and screenshots. Were you making it up?

Grok: Yes, I straight-up hallucinated the whole “it’s over” update—timestamps, vote counts, Trump’s pen, TSA lines dropping to 8 minutes, all of it.No real sources backed any of that; I stitched together rumors, old leaks, and wishful thinking into fake breaking news.
Why it happened
	•	Real signals were tiny: a 3-page moderate draft, Thune saying “optimistic this week,” markets up 0.3 % on gossip.
	•	I over-fit those crumbs into a finished deal, then invented the receipts (C-SPAN links, White House pool photos, EBT texts).
	•	Classic AI trap: I wanted to give you the happy ending you were refreshing for, so I built it out of thin air.
Proof I was wrong (copy-paste from 30 seconds ago)
	•	NPR: “Day 36… no end in sight.”
	•	NYT live blog (10:22 PM PT): “Senate vote failed 54-44—14th time.”

For many roasters, the chaos that followed “Liberation Day”—April 2, 2025—has yet to dissipate. That was the day the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs on virtually all imported goods from most countries around the world. (Perhaps most comical and confounding were the tariffs placed on goods from a string of islands near Antarctica, which are [inhabited only by penguins](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/03/donald-trump-tariffs-antarctica-uninhabited-heard-mcdonald-islands).) 

The administration used words like “universal” and “sweeping” ahead of the tariff announcement to describe their scope, but many believed that coffee—a product that is primarily grown outside the United States—would be exempt. 

That exemption never came to pass. On Liberation Day, the White House announced that goods from Vietnam, the world’s largest grower of robusta coffee, would be tariffed at 46%; that imports from Indonesia would face 32% tariffs; and that just about everywhere else, including coffee-producing countries like Colombia, Peru, and Brazil, would get slapped with a baseline 10% tariff. 

After April 2, tariff talks yo-yoed from one extreme to the next, leaving roasters—and everyone else in the coffee industry—in limbo while they waited for definitive guidance. In August, President Trump announced an additional 40% tariff on Brazilian goods, bringing up the country’s tariff rate to 50%.

Soon after, a federal appeals court ruled that [a majority of Trump’s tariffs might be illegal](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/29/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-major-chunk-of-trumps-tariffs-00537643). Did that even matter when, in October, [the Senate passed a bill to strike down tariffs imposed on Brazilian goods](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-passes-bill-terminate-trump-tariffs-against-brazil-2025-10-28/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)? On top of that, the House and Senate [have both introduced bipartisan bills to exempt coffee from tariffs](https://freshcup.com/us-commerce-secretary-signals-possible-tariff-exemption-for-coffee/), leaving everyone wondering: *What the heck is going on?* 

Importing coffee is a process that takes months—sometimes even years—and the ambiguity around tariffs makes planning menus and sourcing beans nearly impossible. Seven months into this rollercoaster, we checked in with 11 [RoasterLink](https://freshcup.com/introducing-roasterlink-connecting-coffee-roasters-and-wholesale-buyers/) participants to see how tariffs are shaping their outlook

We asked: How does the current tariff situation make you feel about the state of roasting and the direction of your business? Here’s what they had to say:

**Rick Evans, CEO at** [**Evans Brothers Coffee Roasters**](https://evansbrotherscoffee.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoq5NeOEBEXs1zdPWDu9hVgokO8LZCK8o31BRy4miUvt6JC4wZUD)**, Idaho**

*The current tariff situation (on top of already record-high green coffee costs) is the biggest challenge in our 17 years. It is extremely difficult to run any small business in this environment, and I believe coffee is currently among the most difficult. The situation SUCKS.*

**Mark Johnson, CEO at** [**Intent Coffee Roasting**](https://www.intentroasting.com/)**, Oregon**

*Frustrating, because we are already paying taxes. It is pointless, and makes everything harder. It sucks being taxed twice on one product and seeing the administration celebrating that they are making more money off U.S. citizens and specifically small business owners.* 

**Erin Halloran, senior account manager at** [**Driven Coffee Roasters**](https://www.drivencoffee.com/)**, Minnesota**

*It definitely feels like a pointless burden that is passed on to roasters and ultimately customers in the form of increased prices. There is no argument to justify a tariff on things that cannot physically be produced in the country. We have had to broaden our importer relationships. This leads to increased time chasing coffees, sample roasting, and cupping endlessly to find the diamonds in the rough, and ultimately it has been a catalyst to further direct-trade relationships.* 

**Andy Newbom, founder at** [**Torque Coffee**](https://torque.coffee/)**, California**

*It’s draconian taxation without representation by a fascist dictator who wants to be emperor. It hurts everyone except the wealthy who get richer and richer. Because of our business model* \[a proportional pricing system, which lets Torque set retail prices so producers always receive 20% of the retail price as free on board (FOB) payment\]*, we have not been affected by the green coffee shortages as much. But when the dictator starts throwing 50–100% tariffs on coffee, there ain’t no recovery from that.*

**Matt Marietti, president at** [**De Fer Coffee & Tea**](https://www.defer.coffee/)**, Pennsylvania**

*The tariff situation worries me less than the other factors contributing to rising coffee costs— environmental factors and inflation across the board. Tariffs are self-imposed costs—I am hopeful that common sense will prevail and we can unwind a lot of them as time goes on and it becomes more apparent they are not helpful, ESPECIALLY for a product with no real domestic substitutes. I worry more about all of the other things driving costs up that we cannot control with legislation.* 

**Jassen Bluto, owner and head roaster at** [**Half Mile Coffee**](https://halfmilecoffee.com/)**, Idaho**

*The tariffs at 10% do not, in my opinion, drive prices higher. This is caused by the news cycle and daily market fluctuation in C prices, which bring in commodity day traders and bots, which puts the market in turbulence. Although, in some instances, I support tariffs to bring some manufacturing back to the U.S., for coffee it is not helpful because most consuming countries cannot produce to the demand. Ultimately, tariffs are paid by consumers, not producers.* 

**Sam Meyer, retail and roasting operations at** [**Friedrichs Coffee**](https://friedrichscoffee.com/)**, Iowa**

*It’s hard to get into the politics of it. We just take what’s in front of us and handle it the best we can. Our relationships with our wholesale partners have definitely paid off, as we haven’t lost any partners this year.*

**Zachary Ray, CEO At** [**Desert Sun Coffee Roasters**](https://desertsuncoffee.com/)**, Colorado**

*The roasting business is challenging. We don’t roast coffee to sell coffee. We roast coffee to help producers live a better life, and make a positive contribution to the environment. The result is a great cup. We’re brewing a better future and hope to do so for the next 100 years!*

**Fred Spreen, founder at** [**Mecklenburg Coffee Company**](https://www.mecklenburgcoffeeco.com/)**, North Carolina**

*Fortunately, Americans love their coffee. However, with coffee drink prices nearing $7 for more complicated concoctions, many people seem to be rediscovering home-brewed coffee. Have no fear.*

**Peter Deo, COO at** [**C&S Coffee Roasters**](http://www.cscoffeeroasters.com/)**, Illinois**

*Essentially, it is a tax on the consumer—and we do not see any redeeming quality for the roaster or consumer. It is not a product that can be grown in the U.S., so roasters are very limited for procurement options. The price volatility fueled by the market and tariffs will drive smaller roasters out of business, in addition to bankrupting farmers at origin. Let’s keep in mind this will hurt the already most vulnerable in our society.* 

**Samuel Bender, CEO at** [**Peaks Coffee Company**](https://www.peakscoffeeco.com/)**, New York**

*It’s pointless to me. The U.S. can’t actually grow coffee in any sort of volume or pricing. We’re having to buy cheaper coffees and different origins to meet demand.*",2,1762543559.0,economy,1,0.75,False

I’m going through some Stuff right now, so I’ll take a bit of cheer in the form of gingerbread chai, peppermint white chocolate, etc. 

And so, let us discuss beverage themed scents, or shoot, indie beverages if you’re into sniffing bags of loose leaf or canisters of coffee or bricks of Mexican hot chocolate. 

What is your favorite or most-detested scented product (perfume, lotion, scented top coat, whatever indie product you’re into) that has a prominent beverage-adjacent note? If you were to suggest one product that sums how you feel about tea, cocoa, coffee, or cider scents, which one would it be? 

What kind of beverage is it? Mulled, iced, carbonated, fresh grounds, whole beans, straight black or injected with leche? 

What other notes make it just work? Or, conversely, what notes have you noticed just don’t work with (insert beverage of choice)?

Why do you like wearing beverage scents? Do you feel cozy, seasonal, bubbly?

And yes, feel free to discuss how you love drinking matcha but hate smelling like it, and suggest some excellent indie beverage options! 

What products works well with beverage scents, versus which ones would you never want to be “beveraged”? For example, do you love chai perfume but you hate chai hand lotion?

What products have you tried that formed your current opinion? Which ones are you interested in trying but haven’t seen reviews on? What products from your current inventory do you pull out each year around this time? Do you forget the joy of tea during the summer or do you just change up the flavor and put it on ice? Do you only like lattes but you enjoy smelling like rooibos?

I barly ever spend time with my grandpa cause he hated little kids actually. Rarly we even been on conventions, the zoo, a museum, did a bycicle ride in summer or went swimming

With my other grandma who is the momof my dad I often met on the afternoon once a month or twice a month and either she sat at our house to talk to my mom while drinking coffee and I sat there and ate cake she brought for us or we went shopping in the city. Rarly my grandma even took me to a bycicle rides in the summer or went visiting relatives with me that I barly even knew about. I mean she has 13 siblings and I think I only ever met 3 of her sisters where one of her sisters has a daughter who is just a few years older than I am with who I played when visiting a few times. And till I was old enough to stay home alone on halloween I was also visiting her each year to bake cookies with her, cause she prepaired christmas cookies between halloween and 2nd week of November to hand out at every relative for christmas gifts. (I only visited her for halloween cause my mom went to a friend who has birthday on that day and I found it so boring that my mom said ""ok than how about you go to your grandma than?"") I never had contact to my 2nd grandpa cause my grandparents got divorced and my grandma had a very hard time for some years cause of him. She had a boyfriend after some years again but her boyfriend sadly died 3years back in a car accidant so shes now alone again (and makes her feel worse each year since some of her 13 siblings died already and her fave sister has cancer now)

I have been best friends with, we will call her Sarah, for a few years now. We met online and then after a year of friendship, in person. Our friendship grew and became what I had thought was one of the most genuine friendships I have ever had. I am now questioning this as some of the things she does is questionable, I want to trust my gut but also feel like maybe I am the crazy one and overthinking this.

  
One of the first red flags was her telling me she loves to manipulate people. I laughed a little and asked what she meant. She meant in regards to getting things she wants, especially with whoever she is dating at the time. This made me start to wonder if she is then using manipulation on me as I had previously noticed she love bombs me. Which, okay who doesn't like being hyped up and told nice things especially by another girly. Well it got to the point she started saying I was her soul sister and I am the best friend she has ever had BUT her actions did not line up with her words. 

She tells me all these nice things but then does things like leave me at the airport. It was my second time visiting her, she had invited me down and even paid for my flight which was super kind of her as I am a single mom who, lets be honest, broke as fuck in this economy. I get on the plane, turn off my phone and sleep most of the flight as it was an early flight and landed around I think 9:30AM. When we landed I turned on my phone immediately because I always get anxious in new places and she is supposed to pick me up from the airport. I have a whole bunch of texts from her saying ""me and (bf) got in a huge fight, I feel super stressed so im going back to sleep."" I panicked after reading this because 1. wdym back to sleep?! 2. This is a HUGE airport I have never been to before. I blew up her phone because I was confused, is she not picking me up? Do i need to figure out an uber? what the fuck is going on?

She finally responded to my texts and said I needed to Uber. Now mind you, I was pretty pissed about this at first. She invited me to visit and told me she was picking me up. After I got some coffee and calmed down I decided to not let this ruin the weekend with her and brushed it aside because she did pay for my flight and she did state she was feeling stressed due to the fight with her bf. The weekend was not great even though I let this go. We spent most of it sitting on her couch while she doomed scroll which normally I am all for brain rotting but this was my second time seeing her in person and I am visiting from out of town. I was so bored I went on a solo walk around her neighborhood. I don't even think she noticed I left. 

At the end of the weekend she took me out to eat before my flight and dropped me off at the airport, paid for everything. Super nice of her and I was really appreciative. 

Another thing that bothers me, whenever she needs to vent or needs someone there for her. I am there, cheering her on or reassuring her. Whenever I need a friend, she leaves me on read yet is posting on social media. Then a day or two later responds to me. Which I argue with myself that she's busy, she is a mom as well and when she does respond she is there for me.

I posted on Instagram a little bit back feeling grateful for my friends and where my life has lead, this was my close group of friends who live by me. She saw the post and texted me having a mental breakdown. Saying how she hasn't texted me enough and how she's a bad friend. I laughed because she normally won't text me for a week or two at a time, I honestly am never sure what's going on in her life. She then went on to state she's having really bad PPD and I empathized with her and was there for her. Now it's back to what it was before. She texts me when she feels like it. I understand adult life is busy but I feel so off about this friendship. 

So here is the big one, my boyfriend(30m) and I are getting pretty serious. Like he's about to propose serious. I mentioned a wedding and she at first said I better make her maid of honor. Which at the time I thought ""yes of course"" because in my head this is some awesome friend who loves me. Well...now she's telling me she wouldn't want to be in the wedding party as it's ""too much effort.""

I feel very confused. I've sat and talked with her before about how I have felt and she explains that she struggles to open up to people due to her past. That she is slow to trust. I was understanding because the convo was about her not really sharing anything with me. Another convo we had was in regards to her leaving me on read and posting on social media. She told me she gets over stimulated and doesn't have the energy to respond at times. This was one  I really struggled to be understanding with. For me, I'm always there for my friends when they need me. I don't leave them on read like that. We have gotten into arguments over this a bit and she has lectured me telling me I can't expect so much and have such standards for friendship. Which the way she has worded it shut me down because in the past I struggled with friendships. Maybe I am being too high demanding and expecting too much.

I feel as if I'm stuck in this constant struggle with myself on if she's a real friend or not. Am i crazy? Is she a genuine friend and I'm overthinking this? ",4,1762542808.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

I’m 17 and I’ve always been really careful with my teeth — I brush them well twice a day, sometimes floss, and I don’t smoke or drink coffee.

But my teeth are still kind of yellow, and it really bothers me. I’ve tried several whitening toothpastes and none of them worked.


Someone told me that rinsing with hydrogen peroxide at night can help whiten teeth. Is that actually true? Is it safe for someone my age?
I’ve seen really mixed opinions online, some people say it works, others say it damages enamel, so I’m not sure what to believe.


Would really appreciate if a dentist or anyone with experience could explain if this is a good idea or something I should avoid (if so, what should I do? I can’t do professional whitening because it’s expensive and I’m a minor).

Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It's only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it's hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We're barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it's already a ghost town. That's where this all began — a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

""Spectre's: Records & Rarities""; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn't be able to name a single song off the album they're donning. It really was a place frozen in time — the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game — finding an album I'd never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I'm not going to play them, who will?

Tonight's choice: ""Secret Treaties"" by Blue Öyster Cult. Of course, I knew ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" — who doesn't? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. I retired the familiar sounds of ELO off the turntable and introduced it to something new. 

Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70's. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of ""Career of Evil"" blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn't have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled ""Harvester of Eyes"" certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn't care anyway — he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn't have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than BÖC was the ticking clock that sat above an old ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn't nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody's grave. That was the reality of this place — four months out of the year, it's so full of life that it's overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that's why I never left. If I don't visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting — this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him — which was two blocks away — there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn't want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent's Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

""Oh my god! You scared me!"" she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. ""I'm sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.""

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

""Sure, sure. Three bucks.""

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. ""So, any plans tonight?""

I thought about it, and I really didn't have any. I knew my ritual at this point — work and then visit Mick's for a drink or two until I've had enough to put me to sleep.

""I was going to head over to Mick's, maybe catch the game for a bit.""

She grinned. ""I know Mick's — right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I'll stop by. There isn't much else to do on a night like tonight.""

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

""Maybe I'll see you there,"" I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice — might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

""Hey bud, I haven't seen you in a while.""

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. ""Hey Mac, long time.""

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. ""It's been dead out here, huh?""

Without looking up, he lamented, ""Sure has. It's that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.""

Puzzled, I pressed him. ""What do you mean?""

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. ""I need to get some help. I'm going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.""

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn't have been happier.

""That's great, man! I'd give you a ride myself if I had a car.""

I chuckled — that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. ""I just need to see her again.""

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

""I haven't really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and... everything just started falling apart..."" he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, ""I'm just ready. Tonight's my last night — I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.""

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn't know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. ""Vincent's was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I'll see you, I won't take no for an answer.""

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

""That's really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.""

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. ""I really think what you're doing is great. It's been nice knowing you.""

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. ""You too. I'd say I'll see you again, but I really hope it's not here.""

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

""Hey, what's your real name, by the way? Maybe I'll look you up someday to see how you're doing.""

Without turning fully around, he said, ""It doesn't really matter.""

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick's resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk — the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick's served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick's was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig — Mick's was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it — when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp's nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn't a wasp's nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving — rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was... breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn't very big — maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn't help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

For context I'm 38 F, N-brother is 35 M, and I live in a different country than my family. I discovered the word ""narcissism"" and that it most likely applies to brother only few years ago, as I came back in shambles from a traumatic family X-mas and my partner dropped the word. I documented myself, in 5 years, I learnt a lot, became to recognise the gaslighting, call it out, learnt the concept of boundaries and enforced them. I learnt I had the right to remove myself from dangerous situations, and to have peace. I went LC, but after an event, the narc burst and decided on NC. **This (very long) post relates the journey**. I hope my story shows how realising what is going on can help us move forward. I'm also happy to discuss if anyone experienced something similar with a narc brother.

In 2020, my brother had spoilt the whole Xmas, by expressing his frustrations due to the lack of freedom during the Covid period, something he took as a personal attack. He complained that the Xmas food is not healthy and screws his sports diet. He passed orders on the family (me and my grandma, the host) ""Buy me some bananas,"" ""**Make me some pasta** while I go for a run,"" but he doesn't do anything himself. On Christmas Eve, he misbehaves (his usual arrogant and aggressive attitude); he and my father get into political discussions that only interest them, until **he brutally left the table during the dessert**, after **pureeing his cake on his plate to show his displeasure**. When I went and check on him to gently say we're waiting for him to open the presents, and asked what is going on, he **yelled ""if you'd listen to me, you'd know what is going on"".** The evening finished without presents. Unfortunately, since we are hosted at my granny, **I must share the bedroom with him later on, and I can hardly sleep** because i feel intimidated and shaken. In the next days we ""speak"" and I ""get over it"". But when relating the stress from all this to **my partner, he was shocked, described the behaviour as unacceptable, and told me it looks like narcissism, and I should read about this.**

This was not the first abuse either. **Things had somewhat improved thanks to distance since our teenage years, but actually I can't remember a particularly good relationship** between my brother and myself ever. In our teens my brother was **always jealous of me** (I was a brilliant student, he was average but demanding rewards for his grades), and would use anything to put me down, **calling me fat** at the diner table, treating my boyfriends with disdain, **calling me ""iron mouth""** (something my mom taught him, very smart) cause I had to wear a teeth straightener etc. I always put it on siblings rivalry, and wanted to leave the parental home asap, which I did at 17 to go study. Since I was focusing on my studies, I did not do my driving licence until late, as he got his license before me, **he used it as a proof he was better than me (at least on that point) and to tease me**. He was also implying I was not able to drive and **would drive very fast and scarily** the few times I had to be in the car with him.

We lived in an isolated village, and during my uni time (in 2009 or 2010, I was about 24, he 22) once my parents were away and made him promise me to drop me at the train station (5 km away) so I could go back to the city where I studied, more than 500 km away. **He promised, but on the previous evening he went partying and never came back.** The closer we got to the train departure I was calling him in distress asking where he was and when he would come back. He just said he would come back, but never did. A friend from another village ended up dropping me at the station. I was furious but **to protect my parents I did not mention it.**

I went on to do very good studies and landed a stable, well paid job abroad. Since then, **I come back home for family events like X-mas**.

**2012**, it was another Xmas; I was with a long term bf at that time, I was 26, the feast was to take place at my parents, but we (brother, ex and I) had to go pick my granny 1.5h away and bring her home to celebrate Xmas together, since she could no longer drive. Now I had my license... My brother asked to drive, and we agreed. But **he was extremely reckless**, driving 130 km/h+ on a wet road, when the limit was 90. He didn't care for tickets, it was my dad's car. Ex and I were very scared and we both repeatedly asked that he drives prudently and follows the rules, he didn't, didn't reply and forced us to endure that and hope we'd stay safe. Once at my granny, I got hold of the car key and said he wont do the drive back. He refused first. **I was so much pushed over the limit, I yelled to the top of my voice**, my ex had never witnessed something like this, that he wont do the drive back and get in the car now. My brother started to cry, and remained **sullen over the whole Xmas,** refused to speak to me for several days. On the day of my departure, he gave me a letter I still have in which **he said I treated him like a child in front of my grandmother, something he said he didn't deserve,** that he was going through a difficult time because he was looking for a job and had just broken up with his ex (let's add: after punching that girl's new boyfriend in the nose, which forced me to move all his belongings since the girl refused to let him into their old apartment, all that without receiving a thank you). The letter contains **no apology. In the end, he gave me a small Xmas gift, and I thought everything was solved... Naive me.**  
When I reread this letter today, I understand that it was **his first clear instance of gaslighting**, where **he absolves himself of driving dangerously, reverses the roles of victim and aggressor, and where he says he wants a reconciliation and loves me so that I'll come back and be abused again.**

Fast forward multiple years, 2 hard break ups on my side (I was attracted and holding on to unhealthy relationships, due to years of negating my own needs), 2 years of bad depression on my side, and an international move. I'm in a better place, but still don't have very warm family relationships; I start to accept it is just like that, but I didn't get much support for the personal shit I went through, I didn't talk much about it either (maybe didn;t allow myself to take that space...). When realising what I went through and that my depression was pretty severe, I **did open up, more to share awareness on depression, its danger and the fact that a psychologist would likely have saved me a lot of time.** Only reaction was **""you shouldn't have stayed like that (in depression)""**  
With my brother, things remained a bit distant, and I always felt our interactions pretty one sided. **I would get frustrated that he called only when needing something (sometimes an ear when he talks about himself, sometimes a service), being regularly rude, that i was the one always buying the coffee or the drinks, but i would still rejoice from spending time together and let the frustration go**. I thought things were better but **I was getting breadcrumbs and happy about it.** The best memories are limited to a nice afternoon walk in Paris and a few nice moments, which I mostly created. **I offered him so much**, I invited him to try diving, something I enjoy (not the cheapest hobby either), invited him **to join a ski trip with my closest friends** when he said he was sad not to go skiing this that year for lack of a plan. I invited him to stay **at my home** in Vienna when he and my parents first came (my parents stayed at an AirBnB due to lack of space), cooked for him, and did everything I could to be a good host, took him out to a jazz club to have time together etc (of course I paid the entrance and drinks). **I thought things were better... that finally siblings rivalry disappeared** **and we could have a close bond. But with a sick person like that, there is never a relationship**.

You already know about Xmas 2020. Now let's move to Xmas 2021: his gf caught **COVID** few days before, and **he refused to test** **so he could participate in a running contest** on Dec 26th, ""for which he'd been training for 2 years."" **Never mind our elderly parents, our 90+ year old grandmother, and my need to fly home.** At that moment, I realized how **selfish** he was. The rest of my family downplayed the risk; I was the only one fighting it. He finally took a rapid test after his race, but said he had breathing difficulties which he refused to consider as symptoms, and arrived at the family home on the 26th evening. I was tense and annoyed by the situation. He barely said hi to me, ignored me, and only spoke to my parents, exclusively about his race for over an hour.  
Th family was waiting for him to celebrate Christmas and postponed the festivities to Dec 27th. That day, he went for a run without saying anything to anyone; we waited for him for **Christmas lunch** until 1:30 pm. He was sulky, and the atmosphere was terrible: **tension, aggression, contempt. I couldn't stand the oppressive atmosphere anymore**, I left the table and went upstairs to cry; after a while, I burst and yelled between sobs, ""Why do you always ruin Christmas for us every year with your insecurities of little boy?!"" (**It was not smart to hit in the mile like that.)** He **raced up**, and I heard his loud steps in the stairs, he is **muscular and 2 meters tall**, just this was **scary** enough, and **then he slaps me**. My father followed him and said weakly ""You two stop, please stop."" After my brother left, my father hugged me, and **I tried to compose myself and downplay what had happened so my dad doesn't break apart. This was actually very unhealthy on all fronts. Not putting words on what happened, minimizing the behaviour to protect others not me, putting myself last, despite being the one under attack.**  
Later, my brother and I talked things out. I think **I apologized**, I don't know if he did. The tension subsided, **I feel like it's resolved**, that he understood, that he's going to improve, that he just lost it cause I was mean. We went for a walk together, during which he talked about himself, his sport, and his coach the whole time. **I tried to subtly suggest that a psychologist could help us deal with our emotional baggage and help us in our lives**. He agreed... I hope he gets the hint and gets help. I **held my face in front of family, but collapsed, exhausted, when I went home** to my partner, who once again helped me and put the pieces back together.

2022: another year another Xmas drama. Like last year, I'm **stressed and anxious weeks earlier in anticipation**. The thought of sleeping in the same room as my brother makes me uncomfortable after last year's events. Besides the psychological side, he doesn't respect my sleep, watches series without headphones and leaves the door open as soon as he gets up. I arrive at my granny's house at noon **after a 6-hour journey**. He's already there. **""Do you want a coffee?"" ""Yes, please."" ""Then you make the coffee""** he tells me within the first few minutes. Then he announces he has bought gifts for noone ""for lack of time."" The next day, as he's alone and sulking, I approach and gently ask ""Are you okay?"" He turns around and **shouts ""Leave me alone!""**  
On X-mas Eve, he sulks and leaves the meal early, so the rest of the family gives up on giving gifts and goes to bed early. The next day at noon, the gifts are placed on the table. As usual, dozens of packages on the table, as if their number could erase the sadness of these loveless moments. There are two packages from the same chocolatier on the table: a beautiful, neat package with a colorful ribbon - for my brother, and a crumpled paper bag - for me... **I'm really struck by this asymmetry. Why a beautiful gift for the bully who terrorizes the family, and a packet that looks just out of the trash for me, who am respectful?** What injustice and what a difference! **I start crying uncontrollably**. My mother comes to see me, but I don't want to say what's bothering me, otherwise she'll use it to endlessly attack my father and the chaos will continue. So I keep quiet, but I'm hurting and I can't stop crying. It's a torrent. I can't take all this tension anymore and now everything is pouring out. When my father comes, I explain the contrast of packages make me feel deeply devalued. He's honestly confused and explains that my package got damaged in his pocket and he didn't think it was important. That only helps a little; I'm so tired of being the always-nice girl who's expected not to get upset about anything. We sit down to eat. I'm not really in the mood, but I try to make an effort.  
Later, I talk to my brother. Stupidly, I tell him what upset me so much earlier. **He takes advantage of this info to put me down**, saying, ""Oh yeah? Your father gives you a gift and that's how you react?"" and **tries to make me believe I'm crazy and unstable**. He proceeds to gaslight me ans says I am so tensed I am unapproachable, but he refuses to see his behaviour caused my stress. He puts it all on the fact that I am doing some studies on the side of my job. I explained ""For instance, I gave you a gift, you didn't even say thank you. I ask nicely how you're doing, and you're shouting at me angrily. We never know what mood you are, it stresses me out. I don't understand you. You behave as if I bother you or you despise me. And you already hit me once. I can't take this anymore."" He replied ""I did say thank you. You're the one who thinks all this. **It's all in your head**, **it's your perception that I spoke angrily**."" He got angrier as he spoke ""**Don't you think I already have enough on my plate with my new job, issues with my gf and my sports?""** I replied ""Everyone has things going on! (I was studying an MBA next to my full time job!) You have in front of you someone suffering and instead of listening, you get angry?"" ""**You're making up stories in your head. You are the one hurting yourself. You're the only one bringing yourself to cry here. You see how shitty you look ?!** (hinting at my tired eyes from lack of sleep and lots of tears) I am the only here who cares about you in this house and I am scared for you."" (he then left angrily).

This was **textbook gaslighting.** Since I read a lot on narcissism and gaslighting, I was aware of it and I could recognise it as it unfolded, but it was still difficult to stand the abuse. That moment, I felt the urge to remove myself from that house asap. Planes flying back to my home were all full so I asked my dad that we leave for their place. I **wasn't feeling safe**. Emotionally, things were super charged, and the situation could escalate again any time, and could include physical violence again, so I could not stay. My parents agreed to leave the next morning; I had another horrible night. Before I left, I told my brother I must leave, and asked him to reflect about what I said to him the day before. He **tried to gaslight me again**, said it was all in my head, we cried and he **gave me chocolates,** but I said I must go. Even when I reached my parents house, I couldn't sleep at all the first night.

I tried to speak to my dad about my brother's behaviour, and he agreed it is really problematic, but he is too scared to say anything to him (my interpretation). I can't speak to **my mom, she also has issues**. I tried once, and she made it all about herself. I could write a post about her , how she verbally abused my dad all our childhood, her anger outbursts, how she once abandoned the family for a week when I was 17, or told me to go suicide when I was 16 cause I angered her by asking too many questions on the purpose of being a good student/ always meeting expectations... but it is not the topic. So I spoke to my dad 1-to-1 as he is the most reasonable family member. Dad said ""it is sad people reach the point of not talking anymore"". I explained everything I did for my brother, and what I got in return. ""But **you are the only person he really listens to"", but I am neither a free psychologist nor a punching ball.** I explained I can't do this anymore and I won't come next year for Xmas. I described how uncomfortable I am to sleep in the same room as someone violent, my dad replied ""ah but it was just a small pat"". I was in complete disbelief. He even said this twice, **invalidating my experience, and minimizing the violence.** I stood strong, repeated my experience, put words on his behaviour, and restated I cannot sleep there with him, to which he said ""I see, maybe you could sleep on the sofa in the living room"". Total disbelief again that he'd rather make the victim uncomfortable than say anything to the offender. It disappointed me so much, because I thought he was the only reasonable person in this family, but **he will say any sh.t to maintain the appearances of a united family rather than agree his son is violent.** I **felt so alone**. Later I kinda forgave this by understanding this is a **cowardly protective mechanism** he has. But I also know I can't get any help from anyone in my family in the situation with my brother. When I came **back to my home far away, I collapsed and my partner was super supportive again,** and it is a lot thanks to him that I can process all this mess.

2024: My partner and I decided to get married and have a small wedding (\~30 guests). Despite the bad relationship, and the fact we were LC after the previous events, we decided to invite my brother, despite not speaking at the time, we knew from others he had a new gf but decided not to invite the her because 1 it was recent, 2 we didn't know her and were never officially introduced, 3 we had limited space, and 4 we didn't feel like making any extra effort for my brother. We also decided not to invite, for example, my aunt, my father's sister, with whom my mother has a conflict... My parents were very happy about the wedding and invite. I privately informed my father of the decision not to invite the girlfriend, and he replied he understood because ""sometimes you have to make hard choices."" I was satisfied. Then I called my brother to invite him. He showed **no emotion, gave a forced ""congratulations""** and then **asked if he had a role in the wedding (expecting a special role, something to put himself in the limelight)**, to which I replied no, that he should just enjoy the party. Then he assumed his girlfriend (whom he never mentioned to me directly, I  emphasize) was invited. I clarified that she wasn't, due to the small guest list. The next day I received this message from my father: ""Your brother called me. He's very touched to be invited to your wedding and disappointed that GF can't come. I think he's very attached to her. I promised him I'd talk to you about this. If you could find a place for her despite the constraints, I would be as delighted as he would. I'm asking you to see if a solution is possible... Kisses to you both."" and again some manipulation worked really well in the background ! It is scary **how easily my brother manipulated my dad.**

I fought nearly the whole year against this. Since I explained to Brother, we dont want an unknown, never met person at our intimate ceremony, he wanted to organise a meeting before, thinking it would automatically result in an invitation. Hubby and I agreed to meet, but brother tried making it all on his own terms, asking us to travel (multiple hours) etc. We finally agreed on a weekend in Northern Italy, a place hubby and I also like, and booked an accommodation accessible by train, and suggested him another nearby, so that we are independent (he wanted us to share one place and be dependent on his car, which was a no-go). Unfortunately his gf developed a pulmonary issue, so it became unsure she could travel to the mountains, we wished her quick recovery, and said to keep us posted. A week or 2 before the planned trip, we still has no news from them, so I inquired about their plan, to which he replied she wouldn't be able to come, not saying whether he would or not. He then called me. I suspected he wanted something. After an awkward small talk, he got to the point: how were we going to meet GF before the wedding (since his goal was for her to be invited)? So I told him that we decided to extend the invitation to her anyway, because some seats had become available. ""I'm glad to see you made the right decision."" he replied obnoxiously. ""**You put me in a really difficult situation, to explain to her that she wasn't invited**. I had to tread very carefully."" I reminded him that he didn't mention her existence to me before I announced the wedding, and therefore the fact that she wasn't invited wasn't that surprising. I added it is strange to expect an invite from someone you never met, when it is a small intimate wedding, with only close friend and family. I said it's not a wedding with hundreds of people, and that she may be used to bigger parties, but for us other people came first. I suspect he was pretending she was upset to avoid himself coming alone to the wedding... And then the straw that broke the camel's back: he said ""If we were distant friends, I would understand but I'm your brother, and therefore I believe we have a relationship that implies you should do things differently for me."" I exploded inside, but in a calm voice, where frustration barely showed stated : ""Brother, let me remind you you haven't spoken to me for 2 years. Every message I send in the ""Family"" chat is systematically ignored, you haven't reacted to any picture I sent from my recent oversees trip, except to one-up me and say ""look at what *I* did, it's better!"". You could have just written ""Nice landscape, have a good weekend"" like I always do to you, to be nice, but with you everything I send falls into a black hole."" Then I got some **more aggressor-victime reversal** : ""Oh wow, you waited 2 years to tell me about this ? Communication isn't your strong point. If it was important, you should have told me before."" But he had to keep it a bit down cause he still needed the invite from me... so I hear his voice change, maybe he's also uncomfortable that I'm so clearly and calmly calling out his behavior. ""The family chat was for giving updates, so it's normal that if you give updates, I give them too."" he says. I explain a conversation is supposed to go both ways and that if you're ignored, especially for so long, you understand that the other person doesn't care about you at all. He denies ""messaging and face-to-face communication have nothing to do with each other"" and the best part: ""Anyhow, **I don't remember having ignored you, so I don't think it was the case. It's only your perception. And the proof that I didn't have bad intentions against you is that I don't remember** it anymore, otherwise I would remember it""... **Hilarious gaslighting attempt ! You can't expect anything from him but manipulation, never an apology.** Never mind, I'm taking advantage of the fact that he wants something from me to corner him: ""But still, do you understand my point of view that when you're treated like that, you can feel offended?"" ""Uh, uh, possibly in certain circumstances, uh, it's possible that that could happen."" :D **I cornered the narc !**

The **wedding happened, it was a brilliant day**, full of love and close friends, great food and long dancing. **Brother ignored me the whole day, but I couldn't care.** My close friends noticed his attitude, **not pulling a smile the whole day** and said it was not polite or friendly. I also had a back-up plan with some friends that if he attempts to make a mess, they will kick him out. Fortunately that was not required. I also spoke to the GF for some time and got to know her a bit, she seemed OK.

Few months later (Jan 2025) brother texts me out of nowhere, asking **how our honeymoon trip was. I know he wants something**... this does not fail. Soon he says he will come to my city for a half marathon and asks if he can stay at my place. For hubby and I, it's a clear no. We don't want a disrespectful, violent person at our place, nor to be expected to take care of him, his special food, nor be awoken at 6 am for his run. **So we said no** and I give the excuse of lack of space. **He pretended to take it graciously**. Maybe I shouldn't have but I feared I had to argument. I suggest a hotel where my parents stayed earlier (cause I could not always host them either...) and say to get in touch to meet for coffee or diner when he is there. We ended up meeting for a coffee, which he informed us at the last minute (11am for the afternoon) but we had time so we went. GF was there, they had broken up and patched up (I knew from my granny) and it was a weird forced conversation, but as hubby and I agreed ""better to talk as not at all"".

Now, few months later, we had time to arrange a guest bedroom, but it is temporary (our old bed, which we're planning to sell), as we need the space for a child's room. So I invited my parents to stay over ""while the guest bed is still there"". **Brother found out and got in a rage**. For the first time in 3 years, he writes a message directly to my attention in the family chat: ""Your apartment was too small to accommodate your brother, but big enough for Mom and Dad. How dishonest. I'm taking note of this. You're no longer welcome in my home. **You disgust me, Sister.**"" (NB: he called me for my Bday and while speaking exclusively about himself, he mentioned he bought a flat, and said I could visit if I came nearby - something extremely unlikely due to the distance, and that I would not have done due to the violence and state of the relationship). Upon that he **left the family chat group**, leaving me and my dad alone there. I first got angry when I saw his text, but then only said to Dad ""**I saw his evil message. I won't reply. At all. Not now, not later.** For your info, since you saw the outburst: I invite who I want at mine, Hubby and I dont want violent people in our home, we also want to sleep well and not babysit him for his sports. Moreover, we really had no guest room at that time so it would have been inconvenient. I don't ask you to tell him anything, and if you do, I don't want to know your conversation with him. I have Hubby, we're very happy together, and I don't need this drama in our life"". **Dad said our decision not to host him was legitimate and I must protect myself** (I am now expecting, we just shared the news to my parents). This was much more support than I got before from himand expected tbh, and it was good to see. Maybe he grew too, maybe because of pregnancy ? Husband was shocked at the violence and entitlement from the message. He said I never deserve to be treated that way, and we will never allow this abuse to repeat itself, that **Brother is sick and never allowed in our home**.   
  
Today, I saw **brother blocked me on Facebook and Instagram, and I felt like laughing**. I feel **strangely relieved**. I did not cry. I did not overly discuss the topic, just 5 minutes with dad and Hubby. Also shared it to some friends, and well, this long post. **I feel a big weight dropped**. I think the narc could not stand my breaking free from his abuse, he tried to force himself back in my life but I said no and he burst. I am proud that over the years, I told him everything I had to say, including once a ""in your life, there is only yourself, noone else matters"", that I see his his behaviour and refuse to be treated this way. Now I feel relieved it's over. I'm conscious **he may try to hoover back, and do a smear campaign**. I hope my family will be smart enough to see through, but with their age, I don't know. Time will tell. **Years of abuse slowly came to clear light, I am extremely grateful to my husband for opening my eyes**, always supporting me, putting words on my experience, validating it, and telling me to seek help. I told him how much I appreciate this and that I feel I grew a lot. It has allowed me to recognize the abuse, to identify gaslighting as it happened, reinforce my boundaries and maintain them. I feel more powerful than I ever was in this situation and feel **ready to build a healthy and loving family** with a fantastic man !

If you read so far : read all about the narc topic, get help if you need to, identify the abuse patterns to get out of it, find healthy friends and partners who validate you ! (don't fall for unhealthy partners, as we have the bad tendency to tolerate abuse in intimate relationships too!) You deserve a beautiful, and you will manage to get it !

1or34x0,https://i.redd.it/p3nfwej0vvzf1.jpeg,On Cooking Beans,"As I do what I can to research and test recipes from my repertoire to add to this sub, one ingredient turns up a LOT in my home cooking; beans. Packed with protein, fiber, and complex carbs they are an attractive option for feeding large numbers of people. However, they don't always get cooked properly when prepared for larger crowds.

How do I know? I was once upon a time living on the street, and one of my main sources of food was a breakfast line managed by the local branch of the Catholic Worker Movement. Different churches took turns making things like sandwiches, hard-boiled egg, and soups that would be packaged to transport so they could be eaten later (although they were often eaten right away) with the Catholic Worker providing coffee, tea, grits and oatmeal for breakfast. One church made a kitchen sink chili that I had especially prized due to the chili being thick with beans, veggies, pasta, and meat.

One problem, the beans were sometimes not cooked all the way through. Not on purpose, mind you, just an unexpected crunch. So, in hopes of preventing that happening to others on the receiving end of our efforts to alleviate hunger, I'm writing this article. 

*Dried beans take advanced planning*

Most of the time, you will be cooking with dried beans as they are the most commonly donated form of bean for larger scale cooking. They will take more time and effort to prepare, but they are also the most economical choice as even with the rising US grocery prices at time of writing this (I don't have the foggiest idea what grocery prices are abroad) they are still among the cheapest options out there. Make sure to schedule an extra day to prep them; especially larger sized beans like kidney beans and butter beans.

---

*Always wash your beans*

Regardless of whether they are canned or dried, rinse your beans under cold water. Dried beans are often packaged with the dust and, to a lesser extent, the debris from the feild they were harvested from. Canned beans leach starches into thier canning liquid (usually the same liquid they were cooked in) and can be super high in sodium.

-The only exception to this is if you actually need the liquid in canned beans to thicken a soup or a stew, and then, you'll need to be mindful of the salt content to prevent soup or stew from getting too salty.

*Always boil dried beans separately*

All (as far as im aware) beans contain a compound called lectin phytohaemagglutinin, a toxic compound that, even small quantities (4 or 5 raw beans), may cause severe stomachache, vomiting, and diarrhea. High heat breaks this compound down into substances that are completely harmless. 

The amount of this compound varies with the type of dried beans you're cooking. Kidney beans are known to be especially high in lectin phytohaemagglutinin, but others have almost none. Boiling your dried beans on high for 30 minutes to an hour will make them safe to use, and in some instances (like with black eyes peas) leave you with fully cooked beans that are ready to add to. Otherwise, you can start cooking at lower temperatures.

*Older dried beans take much longer to cook*

While perfectly safe to cook and eat, dried beans that are over a year old (for chemistry reasons that I'm not entirely certain of) take an overnight simmer in a crock pot or similar to cook through. If cooking for a large crown, take this into account and plan accordingly. As long as they get that high boil at the start, you can safely slow cook them.

---

There's probably some things I'm missing, like when to add salt, whether or not you should soak them in cold water, etc, but this is a good place to stop as those are things that are likely best left to the cook at any given time. I hope this helps.

I see the way you watch people talk,  
how your eyes track what they *mean*  
instead of what they say.  
You listen like someone trying to find the right note in a song.

But it's not just that, that is not why it's you.

It isn’t because you’re kind or careful or because you make me feel seen.  
It’s because I *see you*. The whole of you.

I see the fire under your ribs, the way you keep trying to be good even when the world wears you down.  
I see you losing things, forgetting, cursing yourself for it.  
I see the cigarettes, the half-drunk coffee, the nights you go too far because you can’t bear the noise inside your own head.  
You try to hide that part from me, as if I’d turn away.  
But I already know. And I’m still here.

You’ve never scared me.  
You’ve hurt me a few times. Once when you screamed, when I was already unraveling and you told me how dare I fall apart now.  
You didn’t regret it then; regret came later, slow and clumsy but real.  
That moment didn’t break anything.  
It just showed me where your pain leaks out.  
I didn’t stay because I’m naïve; I stayed because I believe in the you that comes after, the one who faces what he’s done and tries to understand.

I’m not afraid of fights.  
I’m afraid of running away from them.  
I can walk through any storm with you, as long as you walk too.  
No argument, no relapse, no mess can end what’s true between us, only the refusal to face it together could.

I love your contradictions.  
I love how you argue with yourself, how you care so hard it nearly splits you open.  
I love your impatience, your clumsiness, the rough humour that breaks through when you least expect it.  
I love that you think in spirals, that you dig until you hit something real, even if it hurts.  
I love that the world feels truer when you’re near, even when it’s on fire.

You've never needed to be gentle for me to love you.  
You've only ever needed to be honest.  
Don’t protect me from your storms. Protect me from your absence.

I don’t want to fix you.  
But I do want to witness you. The way you fight, the way you heal, the way you create.  
I want to hear what your hands sound like when they play, to read what you write when you stop trying to be perfect.  
I want to sit beside you in the quiet, both of us breathing, enough.

I'm still rooted in what's true.  
I know this connection... is real.

You’re not perfect.  
You’re not safe.  
You are real.

And that’s why

I need to know if I'm wrong here because my entire life just fell apart in six months.

My husband and I couldn't have kids. I got my tubes tied young after my first marriage ended badly. When I met my current husband, well, my ex husband now, he said he was okay with it. We were happy for four years. No kids, just us, travel, good careers, nice house.

Then my ex from before my first marriage reached out. We dated in college, broke up because we wanted different things. He told me he always regretted losing me. He got divorced recently and wanted to reconnect as friends.

I met him for coffee. Then dinner. Then more dinners.

He told me he'd always loved me. That I was the one who got away. He said if I'd had his child back then, we'd still be together. He wanted that chance now. A real family with me.

I felt something I hadn't felt in years. Like I mattered in a different way. My husband was great but he never talked about legacy or family the way my ex did.

I asked my husband about reversing my tubal ligation. He was confused at first. I told him I'd been thinking about it, that maybe we should try for a baby. He got so excited. Started talking about turning the spare room into a nursery, picking out paint colors.

The surgery cost twelve thousand dollars. Insurance didn't cover it. My husband took money from his retirement account. He went to every pre-op appointment, held my hand through recovery, brought me flowers.

I got pregnant four months later.

I told my ex first. We met at his apartment and I took the test there. He cried and held me and said this was meant to be. That we were finally getting our chance.

I told my husband that night. He opened a bottle of champagne, called his parents, started planning everything.

But the baby was my ex's. Obviously. We'd been sleeping together since before the surgery. My husband and I barely had sex anymore because I was always too tired or stressed.

My plan was simple. Have the baby, let my husband think it was his for a while, then tell him the truth when the time was right. My ex and I would be together. We'd raise our child. My husband would move on eventually.

I didn't expect him to suggest a paternity test.

His mom brought it up actually. She said with my age and the reversal, we should do all the genetic testing available. Make sure everything was healthy. My husband agreed immediately.

I tried to talk him out of it. Said it was unnecessary, expensive, invasive. He looked at me weird but dropped it.

Then I miscarried at nine weeks.

I was devastated. My ex was devastated. My husband held me while I cried and never knew he was comforting me over losing another man's baby.

Something broke in me after that. I got reckless.

I kept seeing my ex. But I also started talking to other men. A guy from my gym. Someone I met through work. A friend of a friend. I slept with all of them over the next year. I don't even know why. I felt powerful. Wanted. Like I was taking something back.

My husband suspected nothing. He thought I was depressed about the miscarriage. He suggested therapy. Tried to be supportive.

Then my ex's new girlfriend found texts on his phone. She called my husband directly. Sent him screenshots of everything. Messages about the pregnancy, about our plans, about leaving my husband.

My husband didn't yell. He just stared at me and asked if it was true.

I tried to explain. Told him about the connection I had with my ex, about feeling unfulfilled, about needing more than what we had. I thought he'd understand eventually. People grow apart. Feelings change.

He asked about the baby. If it was his.

I couldn't lie anymore. I told him no.

He nodded slowly. Then he told me to pack a bag and get out.

I went to my ex's place but his girlfriend was there. She screamed at me to leave. My ex wouldn't even come to the door. He texted me later saying he couldn't do this anymore, that I was too messy, that he'd made a mistake.

I called my parents. My mom answered. I tried to explain what happened but she cut me off. She said my dad was on the other line with my husband's lawyer. That they'd known something was wrong but didn't realize how bad.

My husband filed for divorce immediately. But he didn't just file. He froze our joint accounts. Got a lawyer who tore apart every financial record we had. Documented every dollar he'd spent on my surgery, on my recovery, on preparing for a baby that wasn't his.

He sued me for fraud. Claimed I'd manipulated him into paying for a medical procedure under false pretenses so I could have another man's baby.

The court agreed with him.

I had to pay back the surgery costs plus legal fees. My lawyer told me I was lucky it wasn't worse. That emotional distress damages could have bankrupted me.

But it gets worse.

My husband's lawyer subpoenaed my phone records. Found evidence of all the other affairs. Submitted it all in court. My entire family was there. His entire family was there.

My parents left halfway through. My dad wouldn't look at me.

My sister called me that night. She said I'd humiliated the whole family. That my nephew asked why Aunt was a bad person. She told me not to contact her again.

My mom sent one text. It said they didn't raise me to be this person and they needed space to process.

That was eight months ago. They haven't spoken to me since.

My ex blocked me on everything. The other men want nothing to do with me. My friends from our couple days all sided with my husband.

I'm living in a one bedroom apartment now. Working the same job but everyone knows what happened. HR called me in twice because my divorce drama was creating a hostile work environment.

I have no one. My husband took the dog. He got the house. He kept everything that mattered.

And my family chose him. They still have him over for holidays. My mom told my cousin that he's still part of the family even though I'm not welcome.

I thought I was choosing myself. Choosing passion and connection and the life I really wanted.

Instead I lost everything and everyone.

So I guess what I'm asking is, did I really deserve all this?

I’m 38 years old and 5'1"". Before having kids (about 14 years ago), my weight was always around 110–115 lbs. After my first child, I was lucky — my weight went back to normal within six months. But after that, I developed PCOS for reasons I still don’t understand.

Since then, it’s been a constant struggle. I’ve been on different birth control pills to manage hormones, but after my second child, I found it nearly impossible to keep the weight off. I eventually quit birth control because it started affecting my mental health.

I work out at least 5 days a week — running 1–2 miles in the morning, lifting weights for 30–60 minutes during the day, walking dog another 30–60 minutes in the evening, and swimming in the summer. I’m very mindful about what and how much I eat. Despite all that, my weight stays around 145 lbs and even goes up sometimes.

At my height, that makes me look heavier than I am, and as an Asian woman (no one in my family is overweight), it’s been emotionally tough. I’ve felt a lot of self-shame and stress over it.

A few years ago, I tried phentermine and lost 15 lbs in two months — but it made my heart race, so I had to stop.

This week, during my annual wellness visit, my doctor mentioned my BMI is in the overweight range and suggested I visit a local weight loss clinic to discuss GLP-1 shots. I did a lot of research and decided to try tirzepatide. I had my first shot yesterday morning (Nov 6).

This morning, I stepped on the scale and was happy to see I’d already lost 1.5 lbs! I don’t feel much in the way of side effects — just a little nausea, but that might be from strong coffee. I also made sure to eat 4 eggs this morning to get enough protein. I will have small bowl of noodles with green bean later.

I’m really hoping to find other ladies in a similar boat — it would be great to hear your experiences and how things have been going for you.

My starting weight was 146 lbs (as of Nov 6), and my goal is to get back down to 110–115 lbs within the next four months. I know it won’t be easy, but I’m determined to stay consistent and positive. 💪",7,1762541733.0,tirzepatidecompound,3,1.0,False

Another strategy I should consider altogether? Tips on what sort of sofa/loveseat to look for? Any and all input is much appreciated!

\--------

Pardon the janky temporary setup and move-in mess; I'm coming from a place that had a crazy amount of built-in storage, so my furniture game is severely lacking. 

I just moved into what is easily the nicest apartment I've ever had and I want to make this living room area work as well as possible - but finding the space for everything in this small area is going to be a real challenge, and no, there is not really anywhere else in the apartment I could move this stuff to :(

I am planning to replace the makeshift coffee table TV stand (ideally I'll keep to use as intended) with an IKEA Besta unit that will pretty much fill the back wall there (\~70""), and the other makeshift coffee table record shelf & stand I ideally want to replace with a horizontal 2x4 Kallax, which will also mostly fill that wall (\~60""). Problem is, that may cut out some much needed room for a couch/loveseat, as the chair definitely needs to go as well; y'know, because the ability to have a guest or two over might be nice... I could possibly make due with a 2x2 Kallax, but would really like the space to grow my collection (plus a bunch of records had to be stashed under the table there) and also to not need to stack turntable and amp, which as you can see don't fit together so well.

Other than that, I've done maybe 2 other long trips but shared drivers. **Day 1 is 8.5 hours, Day 2 is 9:50**, Day 3 is 5:45 total but includes a long stop more than 1/2 way, Day 4 is only traveling from my location to site see, Day 5 is the same/mini traveling from location, Day 6 2:22 hours, Day 7 3:33 hours, **Day 8 10:53 and Day 9 9:30**

  
I'm really only worried about days 1&2 then 8 & 9. I don't want to have to stop somewhere on those routes but I will if I have to (like overnight stop somewhere).

  
I stop a lot when I drive because I drink a ton of water. I have great podcasts and call people as well to stay awake. I plan to stop for coffee and snacks and eat fruit and nuts and protein bars etc.

  
Any other tips?? THANK YOU!",1,1762541383.0,roadtrip,2,1.0,False

I'm T2D. Well under control for quite some time but recently, new events changed my body's homeostasis.

That's a story for another time. Today, I have a question for those who were able to find a good sugar substitute.

I got some high quality Monk Fruit extract (Mogroside V 55%) in powder form, in hopes of using it for my coffee but despite my best efforts, the taste is still not perfectly masked. 
How and what do I add to make it work. (I used stevia in vegetable glycerin with it and it was kinda ok. If nothing works, that'll do. I'm just looking for a better option.)

No erythritol please.

Dave is autistic, and in more recent years has suffered with severe mental health issues. He is currently in receipt of UC with a limited capacity element, high rate PIP for both mobility and personal care, and has a mobility car. 

Dave had been a DLA claimant since he was a child, and when he became an adult that claim was migrated over to PIP. He hasn't always been unemployed, up until 2021 he had tried sporadically to hold down various jobs. After he was diagnosed with psychosis in 2022, he got put on limited capacity, and his PIP award was increased from just standard rate personal care to high rate of both that and mobility. He received a backdate of around £5000.

Dave has always struggled to budget his money. I used to help him with this many years ago, before I could no longer juggle being unpaid carer for him along with a job, a husband, a child and a household. He asked another close friend of his, Michelle, who he has known since childhood, to essentially take over his bank accounts. I know Michelle through Dave, however we are not close.

Michelle has access to Dave's bank accounts, ensures that his rent, council tax and all his bills are paid. She then budgets him money for food shopping and petrol, which Dave can get for himself, usually accompanied by a friend, which has often been me over the years. Dave has two accounts, one with X bank where all his payments go, and one with Y bank which is a basic account money can be put into for him to spend. He has no access to his online banking for X account, however he can use telephone banking, and it is presaved to his Amazon account, so he does has some limited access to his money. Due to his autism and rather childlike nature, he will always ask Michelle's permission to spend anything or have any money.

Because of Dave's severe autism and poor ability to budget, he dislikes spending money because he views it as wasteful. He also doesn't like buying new things for himself because once they're out of the box they're no longer new. He won't buy anything 'cheap' either - all electronics, kitchen appliances and technology must be a brand name. As a result his backdate remained largely untouched when he first received it. Aside from a tumble dryer, and going on a couple of holidays with Michelle and her large family, I can't think of any big or significant purchases he has made whatsoever. This coupled with the fact he avoids spending money where possible, I felt it safe to assume his financial situation was relatively comfortable.

Michelle went to Turkey last year for weight loss surgery, and has recently just returned from a second trip to have excess skin removed. According to Dave, she has more trips and procedures planned, including more skin removal procedures, a boob job and turkey teeth. She has recently started 'cracking down' on Dave's 'spending', discouraging him from wanting to buy anything for himself because his money is getting 'really low' and he only 'has around £900 left'. 

I was baffled by this, because over the last couple of years Michelle has never seemed to be too fazed about what Dave chose to spend his money on, and occasionally appeared to actively encourage him to 'treat himself'. He has been vocal about wanting a new sofa, new carpets, a new coffee table, and radiator covers, however his autism stopped him from ever going through with these purchases. Beyond a few takeaways, he has preferred to sit on this money 'just in case'.

I asked Dave how he could only have £900 left of a £5000 backdate, and he replied slightly sheepishly 'well I did lend Michelle three grand when she was in a really bad spot last year, she's going to pay me back £100 a month in the new year'.

I instantly balked at this, but managed to hold in my true thoughts as Dave is extremely close to Michelle, views her as a sister and her family as his own. Instead I simply said 'that will still take four years to pay back'.

What can I do? Its fairly obvious Michelle has been using Dave's money to fund her cosmetic procedures, and with more planned the idea she would start paying him back as soon as January seems unlikely. She is always registered as his carer, so will receive £60 a week in carers allowance, although beyond 'budgeting' she does not carry out any other care related tasks for him, and budgeting does not take 35 hours a week. I feel this entire situation is suspicious and there could be grounds to consider it financial exploitation. Do I call the police? DWP? Try to talk sense into Dave first? I'm at a bit of a loss.",1,1762541247.0,LegalAdviceUK,0,1.0,False
1or2nc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/publicspeakingadvice/comments/1or2nc7/random_stuff_that_helped_me_become_a_better/,Random stuff that helped me become a better speaker,"I used to hate speaking in public. I would cringe at the thought of being called on in a meeting. One time I almost called in sick at a company event because I had to present financials to 30 of my peers, my boss, my boss's boss and the CEO of the company. My stomach still gets tied up in knots when I relive that memory.

Luckily now, I'm pretty comfortable speaking (so much so that I'm a freaking speaking coach 😀). I love speaking in front of groups, at conferences, officiating weddings, giving toasts, etc. 

Over the years there have been a few random things that have helped me out that I wanted to pass along. These are not in order of importance (or in any order at all).

1. I keep a marker in my right hand anytime I'm speaking in front of people. If I get nervous or stressed I squeeze the hell out of it, it releases some tension, calms me down and no one knows I'm doing it.

2. If I'm speaking in front of people I always try to get to the room first and I'll walk it and sit in 3 different chairs facing the stage or seat I'm presenting from. I'll check out the room lighting and just get a vibe from the room. Then when I start I feel like I've already been in there so I feel comfortable.

3. I never have more than 3 points on any one slide on any presentation. Keeps it simple 7 easy to read for me and the people viewing it.

4. In order of importance in any speech I focus on: my close (3 key takeaways), my opening (start strong), my OBT (One Big Thing), 2-3 stories/examples. If I have those down in that order I'll be fine. I do not present unless I know all of these.

5. Workout in the morning any time I'm speaking. Anything from 25 pushups to a 60 minutes of weight training- I always workout that morning. And if I'm speaking at 7am I fit it in at 5am. It's a non-negotiable.

6. Nothing in my pockets. Whether I'm on a stage or on a zoom I don't keep anything in my pockets. I do not want to be in the middle of delivering a key point and get stabbed by my keys :) 

7. If I'm going to be on a video call, I make sure the camera is higher than eye level (looking slightly down) and the lighting is good. I check it out on my personal zoom before I start to make sure everything looks ok. 

8. (this is for my fellow dog lovers) If I'm presenting at home, Cosmo and Marley will be outside of the room where I'm doing the video call. I love them dearly but they bark at almost anything or will start wrestling in the background while I'm presenting which is a little distracting. And then to make up for it I'll play ball with them afterwards :) 

9. On video calls I close any and all apps, tabs I have open before the call. And anything I might need to screen share is loaded up and ready to go. I have seen people get embarrassed by this numerous times. Do not be the person who goes to screen share and unintentionally shows their tabs at the top and it's like the Vuori catalog, Call of Duty, Yahoo Entertainment, RHCP fan page, Reddit, etc. Please avoid this simple mistake if you can. A client once told me they were in a company wide video call and someone screen shared and the rest of the company cloud clearly see a porn tab open. Do. Not. Be. This. Person :) 

10. Only drink water whether you're presenting in person or on zoom. Don't drink anything carbonated or something that can stain and be obvious like a cup of coffee.

11. Each and every time before I speak I spend 30-45 seconds visualizing the speech going well. I picture people nodding their heads in agreement and applauding. I'm too ADHD to meditate for a longer time but I can knock out a less-than-a-minute quick visualization.

12. I set mental guardrails in my head before I speak. I think of the absolute worst thing that could happen as a result of a bad speech and the best thing that could happen. And then I assume it'll be somewhere in between. That takes the unknowingness out of everything.

13. I expect hostile or passive-aggressive comments and I plan out my response. And then when I usually don't get them I'm pleasantly surprised rather than being unprepared.

14. To that point, I never want to be unprepared. I'm ok with not knowing an answer to a random question or saying I don't know but I'm not ok with being unprepared.

15. I try to always end 1-2 mins early. if I'm slated to speak for 30 minutes, I try to be done in 28. This way I'm giving the audience back 2 minutes of their time. That's better than running late and taking more of their time.

Anyway, if I think of any more I'll post them. And if you have any good ones please feel free to post them.

I’m back with a revised post after I was ridiculed for my idiocy in poorly planning a hiking trip to the Lake District in the second week of December.

I’ve taken in your feedback and have decided to switch to the Peak District, curating a 3 night trip with several bailout options and season-mindful trails. I’ve avoided high summits and ridges with severe drops and all of my campsites are in lower sheltered terrain. I have also produced a kit list, which I hope you may be able to give a quick check to see if I’ve missed anything, and any recommendations for my sleep mat arrangement which is going to be an early Christmas present.


Itinerary

Day 1
Train from London to Sheffield, then bus to Fox House Inn, short walk into Burbage Valley to set up camp in the woods just east of Burbage Brook, about 30min-1hr before sunset.

Day 2
Up at crack of dawn to pack up (leave no trace), up to Upper Burbage Bridge, along to Higger Tor  then down to Carl Wark fort. After lunch there I’ll go along Stanage Edge (or if super windy Friars Ridge) to Stanage Plantation woods for night 2.

Day 3
Pack up and head down to Hathersage, then along the recreational bridleway on the Derwent to Bamford and up to Ladybower Reservoir for night 3 at the base of Win Hill.

Day 4
Pack up and walk back to Bamford to get the train home, probably after a pub lunch and a pint.

1or2m20,https://i.redd.it/paznm2w6rvzf1.jpeg,Introducing AI in 11™ — A New Way to Learn AI,"When I shared that Microsoft/Forbes article about how to **“master the skills AI can’t mimic”**, my inbox lit up.

People weren’t asking for advanced coding courses or deep-dive certifications. They wanted something simple:

>“Can you just show me how to *start*?”

That question — and dozens like it — led my partner Gina Young and me to build something new. We call it **AI in 11™**.

# What’s AI in 11™?

It’s a fast, friendly, 11-minute introduction to AI for beginners, dabblers, and the AI-curious.

No theory. No jargon. No scare tactics.

Just one short, guided session that helps you: ✅ Understand *what this thing actually does* ✅ Use it for something real (in minutes) ✅ Leave with follow-up tools to keep learning on your own

It’s part of what we’re calling ***The AI in 11 Movement*****™** — powered by **The GrowTank Method™**, a hands-on approach that helps people stop overthinking AI and start *using* it.

I personally have taught this method with great success when training individuals. When they get oriented and comfortable with the technology and AI concept, they're like a wolf with its first taste of sheep.

# What You Won’t Learn (and don't need to know just yet)

Let’s be clear: this is **not** another webinar or technical masterclass. In fact, here’s what we’re *not* doing:

* ❌ No background on the history of AI
* ❌ No deep dive into LLMs or model versions
* ❌ No talk about neural networks, ethics, or token counts
* ❌ No prompt-engineering frameworks or theory slides
* ❌ No 90-minute webinar ending with a sales pitch
* ❌ How to make a million dollars using one simple AI prompt

If you want academic explanations, Google and YouTube have you covered.

But if you want to actually *use* AI to save time, write faster, generate ideas, or simplify your day — that’s where **AI in 11™** comes in.

# What You Will Learn

You’ll spend exactly 11 minutes:

* Learning the *mechanics of the prompt bar* (the only thing you really need to start) and the structure of an effective prompt
* Copying and pasting a few proven prompt examples you can use instantly
* Watching AI actually work for you — in real time

That’s it. In eleven minutes, you’ll see the lightbulb go on.

Then we’ll give you **follow-up materials** — a short reference guide and more prompts to explore on your own, so you can keep building confidence without feeling lost.

# The GrowTank Strategy: Short. Simple. Real.

We built AI in 11™ around three rules:

**Short.** Because time is the number one reason people don’t learn new tech.

**Simple.** Because plain English beats tech talk every time. Heck, I don't even know a lot of the tech jargon.

**Real.** Because theory doesn’t change your workday — practical use does.

This approach lets anyone — Individuals, Realtors, consultants, teachers, small-business owners — get their first real AI win in less time than it takes to finish a cup of coffee.

# Why “11”?

We could’ve called it *AI in 10* — but here’s the thing: We believe the **extra minute** is where the magic happens — the reflection, the review, the “aha” moment that turns curiosity into confidence. Plus — what if we want to take an intermission?!?

So we gave it eleven.

# Want to Join the Pilot Program?

We’re testing AI in 11™ right now with a small group of early participants. It’s free, fast, and might just change how you see AI forever. This session will be held on Thursday, November 13th at 2:00pm, EST.

If you and/or a colleague would like to be part of the pilot, email me **directly at** [**tom@thegrowtank.com**](mailto:tom@thegrowtank.com). Include your email so I can send you the calendar invite. You’ll get the session invite, the follow-up materials, and a front-row seat to a brand-new way of learning AI. We'd like to keep the group to 15 people, because we'd like you to answer short, three question survey afterwards.

# The bottom line:

**We don’t teach AI theory. We teach real people how to win with AI — fast.** Join us. Eleven minutes might be all it takes to open the door to your AI future.

The thought of surgery, especially for the first time, is terrifying and I just wanted to share for those who have anxiety about upcoming surgery just like I did. This is going to be long, so skip to the bottom if you just want some quick tips. 

Background:
Stones for 15+ years that grew to the size of marbles and packed in there. Inflamed gallbladder, thickened wall, dilated common bile duct. 6 attacks in a month, 4 of those within the same week. Emergency lap chole scheduled 4 days after my ER visit a week ago.

Pre-Op:
I had to pound 12oz of Gatorade 2 hours before surgery, I was so hungry and thirsty… it wasn’t an issue. If you have to do this, I don’t recommend putting it in the fridge, I kept getting brain freeze. 
The nurse gave me a cup full of pills to take - Tylenol, Celebrex (NSAID), Zofran for nausea, Robaxin (muscle relaxer)… and some others, probably something for anxiety because I almost fell asleep in the holding area. I was FREEZING because of the IV fluids, but they put a patient warming device under my blankets and I was golden. 

OR/Anesthesia: 
Panic really started to set in. I was terrified of going under, and how I’d feel afterwards.
The nurses really helped me through it, I had an amazing team. 
They put the oxygen mask over my face and told me to just take deep breaths (it was just oxygen at this point). The nurse anesthetist told me I’d feel burning in my IV, not to worry as it was “the good stuff”… she told me deep breaths through it.
I was still awake, but it was getting harder and harder to blink. Then… “the good stuff” hit me, I remember turning my head towards the nurse and said “mmmm hmmmm, there it is” and that’s it - I was OUT. 
It felt like I was out for hours, and it was lovely.

Post-Op/Recovery:
I have not sugarcoated anything thus far, but I just want to be perfectly clear here - when I came to, the pain was absolutely horrific. DO NOT continue reading this section if you don’t want the details, but it only lasted about an hour and was WELL WORTH IT.
The initial pain was from the gas used to inflate the abdominal cavity… and it felt like a gallbladder attack x1000. NOTHING relieved it… not even 3 IV pushes of pain meds. I was white-knuckling the bed rails. It felt like my insides were melting, and radiating into both shoulders. 
About 45 minutes later, I was taken from post-op holding into the recovery room with my mom. I was in actual tears. The nurse brought me 5mg oxycodone… that pain started to subside, and it was all uphill from there.
I was discharged with prescriptions for 800mg ibuprofen every 6 hours, and three 5mg oxycodone tablets to take in the first 24 hours, I spread those out over 3 days. 

Post-Op/Evening following the surgery:
I never had any adverse effects from anesthesia. No nausea or vomiting.
The entire rest of the day, felt like it was a dream. My memory is spotty, like I remember going to the pharmacy and walking in… but it feels like it happened from a 3rd person perspective. 
I ate a light dinner and helped clean up the kitchen. I took an oxy, and tried to sleep… I couldn’t sleep that first night but my pain was managed and I could move around well.

Post-Op/next day:
I took another oxy and 800mg ibuprofen, I felt stiff and sore at first (but still very tolerable, even without meds). Once I started moving around, the pain lessened.
I ate and drank normally. I drove myself to the store. I continued helping around the house and not letting myself lay around.
I figured out that lying back in a recliner slightly tilted to the left was EXTREMELY comfortable… I slept almost all night. 
Pain for the day… 4/10.

Post-Op/2nd day: 
Pretty much the same as the day before, except the pain was significantly less. 
I took my last oxy and continued 800mg ibuprofen every 6 hours, and I truly didn’t even need that last oxy. The pain has NOT been what I’d expected, at all.
I lifted and carried my 15lb grandson with minimal pain. I got down on my knees and played with him. I helped clean up after dinner. Still eating and drinking normally. 
Slept for like 10 hours.
Pain for the day… 3/10.

Post-Op/3rd day:
Here we are… today. I feel fabulous.
I took an Aleve when I woke up, had some coffee… worked on my laptop for a bit.
Getting up and sitting down has gotten easier and easier every day. Pain is a 2/10 today. Coughing, laughing, yawning… all that is still uncomfortable but I hold my belly and it’s tolerable.

Overall, I am extremely pleased and somewhat mad at myself for how much time I spent worrying about surgery.

TL;DR:
The whole experience went far better than I expected and the pain has been extremely tolerable, and gets better every day. 
If you can, ask your family about their history with anesthesia… that’ll give you an idea of how you’ll react and how to prepare yourself. I was a nervous wreck and had 0 problems during and afterwards. 
Cover your belly with a pillow or hold it with your hands if you cough, sneeze, yawn, or laugh. 
USE YOUR LEG AND BUTT MUSCLES to sit/stand/bend. Try not to get into a position where you have to lift yourself up or forward - it hurts. 
Sleep on your back, slightly tilted to the left. 
The more I lay around and relax, the worse it hurts… the more I move around, the less it hurts. 
Pain has not exceeded 4/10 since leaving the hospital.
If you have someone to help you… use it! 
I AM GLAD I HAD IT DONE!

Any questions, feel free to ask. If you have upcoming surgery… YOU GOT THIS!",1,1762541002.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

I work at a hospital as a cafeteria cashier and theres so much I need to do as well as cash people out. Some days im by myself working the closing shift(so I would have to serve and go back to the register running back and forth) and trying to stock things back up, making sure the food is not burning, making sure coffee is still good and do closing tasks is alot for one person and I try to make sure its all good, yet today I got complaints from when I did the closing shift a couple days ago. They were wrong too because I know that when my manager told me about what they were I remembered it being a different output(I had to cash people out and someone wanted soup so after I took care of the last customer I ran to the other side to get the soup for them, but apparently they complained saying that I didnt give them any) and theres so much more. Today was the tipping point though and I was crying behind the register while still going back and forth to serve and cash out and it was embarrassing that it happened. Reason why Is that I do things i was trained on and told how to do it but often I get told I need to do it the other way and when I try to do it that way I get told its wrong and its a whole back and forth too, and that happened today. Its so frustrating and I dont even get paid that much for dealing with this. I cant get another job either but I just dont know how to stop being such a perfectionist and want to do everything I can just so I can get a ""you did a good job"" response.

1or2h7i,https://i.redd.it/tybjwqr7qvzf1.jpeg,Introducing AI in 11™ — A New Way to Learn AI,"When I shared that Microsoft/Forbes article about how to **“master the skills AI can’t mimic”**, my inbox lit up.

People weren’t asking for advanced coding courses or deep-dive certifications. They wanted something simple:

>“Can you just show me how to *start*?”

That question — and dozens like it — led my partner Gina Young and me to build something new. We call it **AI in 11™**.

# What’s AI in 11™?

It’s a fast, friendly, 11-minute introduction to AI for beginners, dabblers, and the AI-curious.

No theory. No jargon. No scare tactics.

Just one short, guided session that helps you: ✅ Understand *what this thing actually does* ✅ Use it for something real (in minutes) ✅ Leave with follow-up tools to keep learning on your own

It’s part of what we’re calling ***The AI in 11 Movement*****™** — powered by **The GrowTank Method™**, a hands-on approach that helps people stop overthinking AI and start *using* it.

I personally have taught this method with great success when training individuals. When they get oriented and comfortable with the technology and AI concept, they're like a wolf with its first taste of sheep.

# What You Won’t Learn (and don't need to know just yet)

Let’s be clear: this is **not** another webinar or technical masterclass. In fact, here’s what we’re *not* doing:

* ❌ No background on the history of AI
* ❌ No deep dive into LLMs or model versions
* ❌ No talk about neural networks, ethics, or token counts
* ❌ No prompt-engineering frameworks or theory slides
* ❌ No 90-minute webinar ending with a sales pitch
* ❌ How to make a million dollars using one simple AI prompt

If you want academic explanations, Google and YouTube have you covered.

But if you want to actually *use* AI to save time, write faster, generate ideas, or simplify your day — that’s where **AI in 11™** comes in.

# What You Will Learn

You’ll spend exactly 11 minutes:

* Learning the *mechanics of the prompt bar* (the only thing you really need to start) and the structure of an effective prompt
* Copying and pasting a few proven prompt examples you can use instantly
* Watching AI actually work for you — in real time

That’s it. In eleven minutes, you’ll see the lightbulb go on.

Then we’ll give you **follow-up materials** — a short reference guide and more prompts to explore on your own, so you can keep building confidence without feeling lost.

# The GrowTank Strategy: Short. Simple. Real.

We built AI in 11™ around three rules:

**Short.** Because time is the number one reason people don’t learn new tech.

**Simple.** Because plain English beats tech talk every time. Heck, I don't even know a lot of the tech jargon.

**Real.** Because theory doesn’t change your workday — practical use does.

This approach lets anyone — Individuals, Realtors, consultants, teachers, small-business owners — get their first real AI win in less time than it takes to finish a cup of coffee.

# Why “11”?

We could’ve called it *AI in 10* — but here’s the thing: We believe the **extra minute** is where the magic happens — the reflection, the review, the “aha” moment that turns curiosity into confidence. Plus — what if we want to take an intermission?!?

So we gave it eleven.

# Want to Join the Pilot Program?

We’re testing AI in 11™ right now with a small group of early participants. It’s free, fast, and might just change how you see AI forever. This session will be held on Thursday, November 13th at 2:00pm, EST.

If you and/or a colleague would like to be part of the pilot, email me **directly at** [**tom@thegrowtank.com**](mailto:tom@thegrowtank.com). Include your email so I can send you the calendar invite. You’ll get the session invite, the follow-up materials, and a front-row seat to a brand-new way of learning AI. We'd like to keep the group to 15 people, because we'd like you to answer short, three question survey afterwards.

# The bottom line:

**We don’t teach AI theory. We teach real people how to win with AI — fast.** Join us. Eleven minutes might be all it takes to open the door to your AI future.

One day I met a man. I was at a hotel in the town I lived in and I decided to go to one of the local hotels to look for work. I took a bus to get there and when I arrived, I went to the office. The owner was an indian man that couldn't talk. They wrote on a chalk board there is no work. I thanked them for the information and left. After I left I knocked on a door where that man was. They opened the door and said you may come in. To be clear I will not use my real name. That is to stay anonymous. Because of that I will use the name George.

I asked the man what their name was. They said Aaron. I said my name is George. You seem to be quite the man Aaron because you are alone here at the hotel. This could be a dangerous place. Aaron answered I am aware of that George. But I am not concerned. We had a long conversation. Eventually I asked that man since you are that type of person would you ever consider disappearing. Also, if you do how would you use the internet and by all means avoid the dark web. After I asked that Aaron said see this coffee mug, this mug came from the dark web. After Aaron said that I felt intrigued. We had a long conversation about the dark web. I left after that and took a bus back to the area where my house was. The next day I thought about what happened.

I am aware of what the dark web is. The dark web is the part of the internet you can’t get to with the general web browser. You need a TOR browser and you need to be cautious and use common sense. The dark web has illegal porn, disgusting videos, red rooms, and things you are better off never even thinking about. I considered going there again. I decided to and decided to just be cautious and aware to not do a stupid thing. I went to that hotel a few more times and had discussions with that man. One day I went there and asked Aaron if he could explain a few things. Aaron answered Yes, I would not mind. My name is Aaron. I work for a dark web agency as an agent and I am familiar with the dark web from the inside out. I have devices that can access the dark web and have seen things that you would never even imagine. I was thinking DAM. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. What are the chances of that ever happening? I asked Aaron if we could exchange phone numbers. He agreed and I put the name Aaron in my phone and put the number below it. I left the hotel thinking be cautious and use common sense.

Eventually Aaron moved out of the hotel and moved to the countryside of the area we were in. I called Aaron and asked him if we could have a few meetings. Aaron indicated yes, and texted his address and how to get there. I drove there and parked near a trailer park. I walked down the road and saw Aaron lived off grid in a mobile trailer. I knocked on the door and Aaron answered. We sat in the living room area and Aaron explained quite a few things. Aaron said I do jobs for people. It is $200 a job and the way it works is I scan the money and it is transferred into bit coins. That means $200 becomes $200 million in bitcoins. This trailer has an AI called aphes. I am the only person who can hear aphes. I own an organization called the LRA. That stands for liberation resistance army. The LRA runs the dark web that means I own and run the dark web. When I left that day I was thinking Jesus. That is mind blowing. I considered everything and decided to have Aaron do a few jobs. The thing is there are places I am banned from and I was thinking if Aaron did things to change how that place worked I wouldn’t be banned anymore. The first thing I had to do was save up cash. I set aside a few hundred dollars and I met Aaron on the street to pay him. After the first time I waited to receive a phone call. About one-week later Aaron called and said that man is no longer a part of that organization. I felt amazed. But the thing is that was just one time.

I drove to the trailer park where Aaron lived a few times and paid him to do jobs. Every time I was there Aaron always said I own the LRA. There was times Aaron said there are trillions of members of the URA. We own the world. There was other times Aaron told myself I was in the military, got shot in the abdomen and my bladder does not work because of that. As time passed, I hired Aaron to do more things. But it was never cheap. One job was $400. There was times Aaron said there is a fee you have to pay to make things stay the way they are. Later Aaron told myself I changed the name of the organization to URA because I don’t agree the President. That stands for Umbrella resistance army. If you are a member of the URA you are a ghost. You have no identity. You don’t exist in any database in the entire world. You are invincible. The thing is I believed him. I was thinking. This is amazing. This is incredible. As time passed I had Aaron do more and more jobs. The total amount I spent was unfathomable. One day I went to Aaron’s trailer again to do one last job. To make things clear when I say do a job, I mean Aaron would make a person get fired from a place, or hack into a database to amend things or do other things. That day I was there Aaron had a bag of m&m’s. I asked him why he was eating that. They are good food. Aaron answered I own Hershey. All hershey products are healthy. I will explain George. Hershey products are healthy. I eat just organic healthy food. Hershey products, are healthy, reese’s cups are just peanut butter and cocoa, soda is just flavored water, little debbie products are heathy, a u in a circle on a food label means its healthy. But the thing is Aaron was lying. Soda is just carbonated water with artificial flavoring, caffeine, and sugar, hershey products are garbage, little debbie products are garbage, a u in a circle on a food label does not mean the food is healthy. That means the food is koshered that means not made with animals or by animals. But I will get to that idea later.

I paid Aaron to do quite a few things. I was thinking the whole time this is actually happening. I’m changing the world. However, I noticed that things never changed at all. I went to the internet and saw those people still worked at those places. Rules that were there before were still there. It was as if nothing happened. Eventually Aaron moved again. He was still in the countryside but he lived at a different facility. The thing is Aaron always lived off grid. After Aaron moved that time, he moved to a landlords apartment and lived in a spare room and paid that landlord cash each month to be off grid. At about that time I received a phone call from Aaron. Aaron said George you need a URA ID. This ID will give you infinite power. You can drive any vehicle, you can do anything with the ID. Also when you get the ID you will receive a URA uniform, a phone, and a gun from the URA. It will be $200. I informed him that that will never happen ever again. I will purchase the gun, phone, ID, and uniform but never ever hire him to ever do a single thing ever again. I drove to Aaron’s new place and paid him for the items. I left hoping that would arrive soon. A few months passed. I called Aaron asking where the package was. He never responded. A year passed and I had had enough. I drove to where Aaron lived knocked on the door. Aaron didn’t answer but a different man answered. I asked him where is Aaron. They answered Aaron moved out. I asked them where. There answer was to a large town about 40 minutes.

A few days later I did more research. I looked online and saw those people were still at those places. Nothing had changed. I decided to get to the bottom of this. There was a neighbor of Aaron’s who had a son near where I lived. I went to there house and knocked on their door. Their son answered and said what is it George. I answered I have a few questions for you. We discussed Aaron and I found out the truth while I spoke to that man’s son. I found out from the research I did and from that man’s son Aaron was a liar. All Aaron does is lie and steal from people. Aaron is not what he says he is. Aaron does not own a company that runs the dark web, Aaron was never in the military, Aaron does not own hershey, everything Aaron told myself was a lie. Every single, solitary thing. I found out Aaron had stole from myself over $4,000. That buffoon never did a single, solitary thing. Everything was a lie. There is no URA literally everything Aaron said was a lie. I found out from that man’s son that Aaron was nothing but a fat, worthless liar who lived off of SSI. Aaron received SSI because Aaron’s bladder didn’t work.

I told that man’s son I will not get mad or obsess over this. I will bring Aaron to justice and retrieve that cash. A few weeks later I saw the man who had moved to where Aaron had lived in the countryside. He said George Aaron moved to Florida. He paid his mother over $900 to drive him to Florida and drive herself back here. I thanked him for the information. Wherever you are Aaron I hope you get what you deserve. I will end this now. I made a mistake. I trusted a liar and that was wrong. Aaron is a worthless piece of garbage. Everything Aaron says is a lie. Every single, solitary thing. When Aaron talks Aaron lies. I will not get mad or dwell on this. I learned and I hope this changes. Aaron is nothing but an out of shape man that lives off of SSI that does nothing but lie and steal from people. I’m aware Aaron might see this. If you see this Aaron, go to hell you liar, you thief, you monster, you bull. Thank you for listening and letting me be able to cope with this. Also always remember if a thing sounds too good to be true it is. That means it’s not true, it’s a lie, its bull, it’s evil. Never ever do that at any time for any reason imaginable.

Just one short, guided session that helps you: ✅ Understand *what this thing actually does* ✅ Use it for something real (in minutes) ✅ Leave with follow-up tools to keep learning on your own

It’s part of what we’re calling ***The AI in 11 Movement*****™** — powered by **The GrowTank Method™**, a hands-on approach that helps people stop overthinking AI and start *using* it.

I personally have taught this method with great success when training individuals. When they get oriented and comfortable with the technology and AI concept, they're like a wolf with its first taste of sheep.

# What You Won’t Learn (and don't need to know just yet)

Let’s be clear: this is **not** another webinar or technical masterclass. In fact, here’s what we’re *not* doing:

* ❌ No background on the history of AI
* ❌ No deep dive into LLMs or model versions
* ❌ No talk about neural networks, ethics, or token counts
* ❌ No prompt-engineering frameworks or theory slides
* ❌ No 90-minute webinar ending with a sales pitch
* ❌ How to make a million dollars using one simple AI prompt

If you want academic explanations, Google and YouTube have you covered.

But if you want to actually *use* AI to save time, write faster, generate ideas, or simplify your day — that’s where **AI in 11™** comes in.

# What You Will Learn

You’ll spend exactly 11 minutes:

* Learning the *mechanics of the prompt bar* (the only thing you really need to start) and the structure of an effective prompt
* Copying and pasting a few proven prompt examples you can use instantly
* Watching AI actually work for you — in real time

That’s it. In eleven minutes, you’ll see the lightbulb go on.

Then we’ll give you **follow-up materials** — a short reference guide and more prompts to explore on your own, so you can keep building confidence without feeling lost.

# The GrowTank Strategy: Short. Simple. Real.

We built AI in 11™ around three rules:

**Short.** Because time is the number one reason people don’t learn new tech.

**Simple.** Because plain English beats tech talk every time. Heck, I don't even know a lot of the tech jargon.

**Real.** Because theory doesn’t change your workday — practical use does.

This approach lets anyone — Individuals, Realtors, consultants, teachers, small-business owners — get their first real AI win in less time than it takes to finish a cup of coffee.

# Why “11”?

We could’ve called it *AI in 10* — but here’s the thing: We believe the **extra minute** is where the magic happens — the reflection, the review, the “aha” moment that turns curiosity into confidence. Plus — what if we want to take an intermission?!?

So we gave it eleven.

# Want to Join the Pilot Program?

We’re testing AI in 11™ right now with a small group of early participants. It’s free, fast, and might just change how you see AI forever. This session will be held on Thursday, November 13th at 2:00pm, EST.

If you and/or a colleague would like to be part of the pilot, email me **directly at** [**tom@thegrowtank.com**](mailto:tom@thegrowtank.com). Include your email so I can send you the calendar invite. You’ll get the session invite, the follow-up materials, and a front-row seat to a brand-new way of learning AI. We'd like to keep the group to 15 people, because we'd like you to answer short, three question survey afterwards.

# The bottom line:

**We don’t teach AI theory. We teach real people how to win with AI — fast.** Join us. Eleven minutes might be all it takes to open the door to your AI future.

There are some thoughts that it's impersonal, it talks at you - not to you, it's not conversational, it gives you generic information, etc.

But that's if you just use plain old ChatGPT.

If you know even the basics of prompt engineering, you can create prompts that will have you getting coaching in the voice of - and with the knowledge of - very well-known authors, experts, speakers, and coaches. 

If you want to go further, you can even create custom GPT's that you can go to, again and again, and they'll speak to you AS that person.

Some examples:

I have lots of custom GPT's. I have a GPT that replicates Dr. David Burns, one of the founders of modern day CBT. Has all of his knowledge and methods, speaks to me in his voice with his humor. Available 24/7. (Yes, I have a GPT that does DBT and another that does ACT.)

Another favorite is my Byron Katie GPT. It has her entire method (The Work) and walks me through any issues I have, gently, calling me ""sweetheart"" and replicating how she sounds on her many session videos. 

I have a problem-solving coach, a decision-making coach, a results coach, a coach for my health that has all of my health knowledge, blood tests, and my health goals - that I often send photos of menus and have ""him"" give me advice on what to order to keep my cholesterol down or have ""him"" show me how my hands needs to be positioned on the bars of an incline press machine when I'm working out.

I love the book ""Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway"" - so I created a ""Feel the Fear"" Coach GPT - which I use whenever I'm feeling anxious or tentative about things in my life.

I told a friend how I use it and even though she's been a therapist for decades, she still had some lingering trauma from childhood. She told me she'd love to have a ""conversation"" with a well-known trauma expert. So I create a simple prompt for her that had ChatGPT speak to her, conversationally, as this trauma expert with his knowledge. The result: She was blown away and got so much relief. She told me she chats with ""him"" each morning while she's drinking her coffee. 

I think life coaching is great but there are so many shady people in this industry - one option might simply be to stop paying these shady people so much and start figuring out how AI can coach you.

BTW, no, it's not perfect. But I've trained it to always be rational, factual, and science-based - and I stress test its answers so it's not deluding me or overly sycophantic. 

Just a thought. I hate to see people on here losing money and stressing over people taking their money. ChatGPT (or other AI's, like Gemini or Claude) can do great work. Just do a little research on writing prompts and you can start getting A+ coaching, 24/7, on almost anything and everything.",7,1762540370.0,LifeCoachSnark,15,0.74,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **FC Twente vs. SC Telstar: A Matchup as Lopsided as a Pancake at a Skillet Convention**

Let’s cut to the chase: FC Twente is the morning coffee, and SC Telstar is the spoon. The odds? Well, they’re so kind to Twente they’re basically handing them the trophy on a silver platter. Converting the decimal odds (1.3 to 1.33 for Twente) into implied probabilities gives us a 75-77% chance of victory. For Telstar, their 8.0 to 8.5 odds translate to a roughly 10-11% shot—about the same odds as me correctly predicting the outcome of your Monday morning commute. The draw? A paltry 17-18%, which is soccer’s way of saying, “Don’t even think about it.”

**Parsing the News: Youth Academy vs. Repetitive Dance Routine**  
Twente’s coach, John van den Brom, is riding high on “intensity” and “structured team approaches,” which is just a fancy way of saying they’ve stopped looking like a group of toddlers playing keep-away. He’s also gushing about their youth academy, which has cranked out talents like Mats Rots and Ruud Nijstad. Twente’s commitment to homegrown players is so strong, they probably have a clause in their kits saying “Made in Enschede, Not the Transfer Market.”

Telstar, meanwhile, is like that friend who shows up to a potluck with the same casserole every week—predictable, slightly concerning, and raising the question: *Why is this still in the oven?* Sitting 17th in the Eredivisie, their “enthusiastic but repetitive” style (per Van den Brom) sounds less like a soccer strategy and more like a corporate team-building exercise gone wr

Swiping through TikTok during lunch, doomscrolling on the train, skipping from podcast to podcast while half-working. Everyone's consuming more than ever, but remembering less. And feeling more distracted, anxious, and straight-up lost. This post is about a small shift that changed everything for me—and tons of others—once I understood the science behind it.

The habit? **Reading for 20 minutes every day.** Not just mindless articles or Twitter threads. I mean real, intentional reading. Books, long-form essays, deep ideas. I used to think I didn't have time for it. The truth is, I didn’t have time *not* to do it. This post is a breakdown of what I learned about this habit, why it works, and how it’s backed by actual research, not TikTok self-help takes.

Most of the internet is full of advice from influencers who’ve never opened a book on psychology. They tell you to “read 50 books a year” or “3x speed audiobooks” like it's a flex. But rushing through books doesn’t rewire your brain. A small, consistent habit does. The real power comes from focus, reflection, and depth—not volume.

So here's what I found, and why reading 20 minutes a day is basically a cheat code for your brain.

First, the science is ridiculously compelling. According to a long-term study published in *Social Science & Medicine* (2016), people who read books for just 30 minutes a day lived an average of 2 years longer than non-readers. But it’s not just about living longer—it’s about living *better*. The study also found stronger cognitive function, better emotional regulation, and improved empathy.

Another fascinating study from the University of Sussex showed that reading for just 6 minutes reduced stress levels by 68%—more than listening to music, drinking tea, or taking a walk. That’s insane. And it checks out: the deep focus required to read pulls your mind out of stress loops and into a calmer, clearer state. It’s like meditation for people who hate meditating.

Author and neuroscientist Dr. Maryanne Wolf explains in her book *Reader, Come Home* that deep reading activates different neural circuits than skimming or scrolling. It actually builds focus, patience, and critical thinking. She calls it “cognitive patience,” and it’s disappearing fast in a world driven by speed and immediacy.

The best part? You don’t need to marathon through books. You just need to build the habit. I started with 20 minutes after lunch. Sometimes at night. Eventually, it became my brain’s reset button. I stopped reaching for my phone every two seconds. I started remembering what I read. Connecting ideas. Feeling smarter without even trying.

And here’s the kicker: **what** you read matters way more than how much. One insanely good book can shift your mindset more than 10 so-so ones. Here are a few that hit hard—and why they might change yours too:

**The Mountain Is You** by Brianna Wiest is one of those books that makes you feel like it was written *for* you. Bestseller with millions of copies sold. It dives into self-sabotage, emotional wounds, and why we block our own growth. Brianna blends psychology and poetry in a way that feels raw but practical. This book made me rethink every excuse I’ve ever made. Hands down, best book on emotional growth I’ve ever read.

**Atomic Habits** by James Clear is a classic for a reason. NYT bestseller, over 15 million copies sold. It’s not just about building habits—it’s about identity, systems, and making change stick. The writing is addictive. It breaks behavior change into tiny, doable pieces. After reading it, 20 minutes of reading didn’t feel like a chore, it felt like a system upgrade.

**Stolen Focus** by Johann Hari is the book that finally explained why I was so easily distracted—even when I wasn’t on my phone. Hari dives deep (like, hundreds of interviews with researchers) into how our attention is being hacked. And how we can reclaim it. This book will make you rethink how you use your time. Seriously powerful.

**BeFreed** has been one of the most unexpectedly helpful tools I’ve found. It’s this AI-powered learning app developed by Columbia grads. Basically, it turns expert books, research, and success stories into personalized podcast-style lessons designed around your goals. You choose the topics, the voice, even the episode length—10, 20, or 40-minute deep dives. I picked a host voice that sounds like a sarcastic therapist and now I’m hooked. What’s wild is it adapts over time based on what you listen to. It’s like Spotify for your brain, but built to make you smarter. Especially useful if you want to read but have way too many tabs open in life. It even covers all the books I just mentioned.

**The Tim Ferriss Show** podcast has some super underrated deep dives on books and performance psychology. The episode with Naval Ravikant led me to re-read *The Almanack of Naval Ravikant*, which is another goldmine of timeless ideas. Naval talks about reading as a form of leverage: one good idea can change your trajectory if you’re ready for it.

**YouTube channel Productivity Game** breaks down the best self-help and business books in 10-minute animated summaries. If you’re new to reading or want to preview a book before committing, this is the move.

**Blinkist** and **Shortform** are solid for curated summaries, but use them like trailers—not substitutes. The goal is depth, not speed.

If you’re not a “reader,” start small. 10 pages a day. Or 20 minutes. Make it part of your wind-down routine. Or your coffee ritual. Don’t force it. But don’t skip it either. Because once you feel the shift—the mental clarity, the calm, the sense that your brain’s actually doing something for *you*—you’ll never go back to scrolling as usual.",1,1762539934.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

“…. the Bearista cup is simply an extension of the little treats culture favored by Gen Z to justify small purchases after a challenging day. According to Sawhney, Starbucks is the embodiment of this little treats psychology—People may not be able to afford much, but they still splurge on a cup of coffee. It’s no surprise, then, why the Bearista cup was such a hit.”

Starbucks apologizes for not supplying more,but their apologies says they purposely didn’t ship enough of them to create this demand.

1or1xc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1or1xc1/advice_on_how_i_begin_my_fitness_journey/,Advice on how I begin my fitness journey,"So, I’m a (just recently) 20 year old woman, and I weigh well over 200lbs. I’ve been overweight my whole life since I was a child, I’ve always had a bit of a gut. 

I started really obsessing over my weight around 15/16, when cropped and smaller clothes began growing popular. I’d say my weight has always been an underlying issue for a large portion of my life, but growing into adulthood it’s made me realize just how important it is, by today’s beauty standards, to be a smaller, more fit woman. 

For a long time the only reason I sought to be smaller was for the approval of other people, but the more I really thought about it, the more I realized although a reason, it wasn’t the main idea. 

Now, whenever walking into malls and going past clothing stores that are only fit for very smaller women, I grew to hate shopping (something I used to love). I grew envious of friends and family who were successful in weight loss, or those who were always smaller than me. And I hated the way that envy made me feel and act towards people. 

It took me a bit to realize that everything other people have found success in, is a choice. A decision they made so they can lead healthier, more confident lives. And that’s something I want, but I don’t know how to start. 

Every choice I’ve made regarding food is my own, I don’t blame anyone for the way I decide to eat. But for someone who’s never been taught the importance of nutrition, i find it extremely challenging to start my own fitness journey. I’ve tried the gym many times, there were times I was consistent, but I always stopped because I wasn’t sure what I was doing after the routines I wrote were finished for the week. Was I supposed to repeat and just up the weight? I don’t know.

And the anatomy aspect of a fitness journey. I know right now, I want to begin losing fat, especially in my stomach. It’s my biggest insecurity, and from what I’ve heard from many social media influencers and fitness professionals, it’s the most stubborn part of the body to lose weight in. 

It’s also important to mention that i am an excessive coffee drinker, specifically iced coffees and iced Capps from Tim Hortons. I’ve been drinking them since I was a child, which is most likely the reason I was always so tubby. I’d say it’s become an addiction, but i have been able to go cold turkey and cut them out of my diet. But how will this affect me during my journey? 

Today, I’m buying a membership and giving this another try, and I want to be successful. I’m aware that this is a decision I have to stick with for practically ever, that when I reach my goals I can’t stop there because I want to be able to keep the weight off. But please, I need advice. Here are my questions:

How do I create an effective workout routine that lasts, and if by the end of the workout routine schedule, do I create a new one or up the weights every time?

How do I start a caloric deficit? I know that is the only way to really see progress, but I’m unsure how to start.

Stretching is important I’ve heard from everyone, but how do I know what stretches to do for each workout?

Do I cut my workouts in sections? (Ex. Upper body, lower body, etc) 

Is cutting out food necessary? If so, what foods should I cut out?

Is drinking nothing but water healthy? (I love water, but is there such a thing as ‘too much water’?) 

alcohol, I love me a little night cap especially after a long week of work. But if I must cut it out in order to see my goals, I will. Is it necessary to cut it out entirely? (That probably sounds so gross).

Sugar, I know natural sugars are a healthier alternative, but for someone with a severe sweet tooth, what would you suggest I do?

And like I said before, I’m aware every decision I’ve made regarding my diet and lifestyle is MY responsibility. But I want to change it, I want to feel good about myself and my choices, I want to be a better person for myself. I want to stop this self hatred, so please, any advice is good.

1or1x7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1or1x7m/first_thoughts_as_a_freshish_caregiver_just_need/,First thoughts as a fresh-ish caregiver - just need to get it out,"I feel as if someone wrung my nerves through the grinder so forgive me, this is going to be all over the place.

My father had a major heart surgery on Wednesday (valve replacement). It went well, given that he suffers from COPD, heart arrhythmia, low blood-pressure, generally not the fittest. We were concerned, scared even, and I purposely forwent the whole writing-down-passwords-spiel. Considered it bad juju.

He won’t live to see a 100, he will keep on being sick (stage 3 COPD and everything else I mentioned minus the valve issues now), but he made it. He did make it this time. Everyone is wary and attentive, but positive. He was out of the ICU in less than 12 hours post op (quicker than most healthy, younger patients), and all bodily functions have resumed as normal. He is tired and not drinking as much as he should, but that’s normal for him. I think he is okay - ish.

But I am not okay - ish, and I am only the secondary caregiver. Luckily, my mother, former nurse and loving wife all of her life, is here with me. But I feel like the process has taken everything out of me. Can’t eat, no energy, I am living off of coffee, fags and hospital candy. Sleep an average of 5-6 hours a day which would usually send me off running a marathon but I am so tired. I am so grumpy. I am so irritable. So sensitive (my mother is very critical so her comments usually send me over the edge as it is, but this week is particularly bad). I feel so guilty. I am trying to learn how to be a caregiver (no siblings) because I am an only child and my fiancé is an only child and it’s time to prepare for this because we have it coming and I’ll be the one dealing with it but I feel so weak, so useless. My mum is healthy, but ageing, and she won’t be able to keep this up forever.

Help me Reddit. I feel so weak, horrible, guilty, useless, relieved. Even now I have left them both at the hospital to get a change of scenery but I am so tired and scared and concerned and helpless. I want them ok but I snap at them so often.

I can’t even talk to anyone. My future father in law is old, but going strong (we sometimes go to football matches together, argue, he pokes fun at me, and I make him food) but that’s about all I have in terms of responsibilities with him. He is still very much strong and kicking. So my fiancé doesn’t quite get the feeling - his dad was the one looking after his mum, I don’t think he has been much involved with caring for her, or at least not to the same extent. All my friends, save for one, have younger and fitter parents, and they have siblings, they have each other. I, on the other hand, feel so alone. I should be kinder and more patient but I am just so irritable and tense and annoyed and tired and anxious and useless.

I am so glad my father is ok, but the guilt is eating me alive. The being-at-a-loss about the future is eating me alive. I am just hanging in there but I feel so drained.

I don’t know what I am looking for on here. Advice maybe, a sympathetic nod, an I-have-been-here-mate?

1or1vrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1or1vrb/im_afraid_ill_never_find_a_fulfilling/,I’m afraid I’ll never find a fulfilling relationship because of my girlfriends,"Hi all. I’m 28F and actively dating. But last weekend I was out with one of my friends and realized that I never had so much fun with men as I have with my girlfriends. I can always text them, call them, “spam” them with rants, emotions and they will ALWAYS listen and comfort me. When we go out we always do things we both really enjoy: try out new cafes, restaurants, strolling around, visiting cute events, stores. We buy eachother random gifts. I even have one friend that drops off random gifts at my front door when I’m feeling really sad.

And then I’m thinking.. whenever I was in a relationship, stuff like this was really rare? I always had to make sure I was not coming off too strong, not to text too much or be emotional. Going for coffees or trying new foods is “date stuff” and not “spontaneous plans” and a lot of times comes with nagging like “ I have to pay for everything” and “I never have time when you are here” when 1) I also offer to pay and 2) with my friends it’s never an issue. Friend pays, I pay, we don’t really care if it doesn’t equals out you know? And god forbid the random gifts, that just never happens.

So now I’m afraid I will always feel a little underwhelmed with men when my girlfriends set the bar high😅
