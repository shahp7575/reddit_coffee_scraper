**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

I'm a couple weeks in my pour over journey. While I habe managed a couple vibrant cups, I now feel like traveling backwards. Ironically, I also am aware of the new coffee drinkers syndrome...

Tldr; difficulties in brewing despite trying various methods. Previous beans were better. What to do?

I recently got a bag of Colombia san gabriel orange tabi light roast beans. Two weeks from roast, but can't really get anything out of them. Previous natural ethiopians had some nice flavours, although never really managed to dial in my setting either.

Currently I am using the hoffman method for 500ml coffee, 30g beans. After researching how to dial in the brew, I started underextracting on purpose. I increased the grind size, reduced pouring height, reduced water temp, reduced bloom time, and stopped all manual agitation. One variable at a time I started going back, but still nothing that stands out. If something positive, I now can easily discern between sour and bitter.

My best pour with this coffee was 30/500. Grind 80clicks Kingrinder K6. Water just off boil. Bloom 60g water for 45sec, swirl for even saturation. Pour up to 300g in small circles at medium height within 30seconds. Continue pouring to 500g in small circles from as low height as possible during the next 30 secs. One gentle swirl after maybe 10sec draw down. Total brew time was around 2min40sec (instead of reference 3min30sec). The outcome had some acidity, but no clear taste notes, no bitter or astringent aftertaste either.

Going back and forth in variables didn't seem to do much for me. Instead I'm inclined to blame the beans. The flavour profile has been described as dark cookie, cream, pear and the palate as sweet and spicy. The previous ethiopian had notes of citrus, orange, watermelon and black tea. Obiously the latter has more pronounced acidic and clean profile, is this just my taste preference? To add to the confusion, I had this same Colombian in pre-ground beans at ny vacation house, and brewed mediocre cups with my Moccamaster dripper, and I could actually taste some caramel in there...

Blame the beans or the brewer? Would it be better to get a bigger bulk bag for less money and practice brewing in larger quantities, instead of 1-2 times a day, or is it harder to dial in due to lower quality of product?",1,1741263260.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1j4ty8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1j4ty8x/life_is_scratching_that_itch_again/,Life is scratching that itch again.,"I don't think I have been truly happy since I was 9 years old.  Life was just weird and difficult and a host of mental health issues cropped up as a teenager that I just hung on to.

Anxiety turned into very physical symptoms that put me face down on the side of a road and picked up by an ambulance a few months back. That was the moment I realised there is no turning back for me. I hit rock bottom. If I stayed like this my life would be absolutely fucked over. I didnt want to be on meds or have to keep up with appointments or any of that.

So I did everything by the book. I set up a bed time and a wake up time. I ate my fruits and vegetables. No soda, no stimulants like coffee or alcohol. I exercised 3 times a week plus yoga on top of that. I made sure to be social and bathe regularly. Clean house, clean mind and all that. Journal, stretch. Everything you are meant to be doing.

I did it slowly and it was incredibly fucking hard. But I just needed to prove to myself if I was actually fucked up mentally and physically. That I actually needed the meds and the tests and someone all in my business like that. 

And it worked. Life is fucking amazing. I have lost weight, I have energy, I feel calm. I joined a boxing gym and I am loving it. I don't have close friends but I have my work buds, and my gym buds. I look forward to things now. Lifes just nice and exciting. 

And its all so easy when you get into the groove of it all. I wish I did this sooner.

Does anyone else have experience with this form of dieting? How'd it work for you and when did you start getting results?

He says we are taking the Panama canal back and praised Blackrock for securing contracts for ports on both ends of it. He affirmed Tuesday that the US will annex Greenland one way or another. He has repeatedly expressed a desire to annex Canada and has started a trade war for the most ludicrous excuses ever. 

I believe at his age Trump wants to leave a grand legacy behind by remaking North America into a single geopolitical unit, with Greenland guarding our eastern and Arctic flank. We already have strategic military installations across Canada and Greenland and he wants to nativize these into a cohesive permanent unit. He believes Greenland will acquiesce with a whimper. He somehow believes Canada will be easier than Mexico and thus is manufacturing a provocation to invade. 

He probably wants to extend US borders all the way to Panama but views Mexico as a far messier task. 

All of this in the name of national security and making America the greatest it’s ever been, but also his legacy, to be remembered  as the greatest president of all time. 

Just my depressing thoughts over coffee.

1j4tlwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1j4tlwa/if_only_i_had_met_him_first/,If only i had met him first,"The morning sun streamed through the window, its warm fingers caressing my face as I awoke. I noticed the empty space beside me in the bed, the pillow still bearing the impression of his head. Johan was up before me again, probably busy making coffee in the kitchen.
It's been nearly two years since our paths crossed. Two years since that chance meeting at the art gallery, where we both stood before the same painting – a stormy seascape in oil. ""It reminds me of the West Coast in winter,"" he said, and I agreed. We began talking about art, then about the sea, then about our shared love for walking along the beach during stormy weather.
But between our meeting and today lies a path I sometimes wish I could have walked differently. If only I had met him first, before all the others who broke my heart. Before all the disappointments that taught me to build walls.
When we started dating, I was already a fortress – strong walls, deep moats, and a drawbridge rarely lowered. How could I be otherwise? Three relationships that failed one after another, each worse than the previous. The last one, with Deon, completely destroyed my trust in love. After eight months together, I discovered he had been leading a double life, with someone else who thought she was the only one.
Johan had to work harder than any person should have to break through those walls. Every time he tried to get closer, I pulled back. Every time he opened his heart, I locked mine a little tighter.
""I don't know what you want,"" he said one evening, frustration evident in his voice. We had been together for six months by then, and he thought we should move in together. I refused again.
""I give you time and space, I try to be patient, but I don't know how else to prove I'm not like the others. I'm not going anywhere.""
That night, I began telling him about the scars I carried, the pain I hid. The difficult path I had walked to get to this point. His eyes softened, he took my hand and simply said: ""Thank you for trusting me with your story.""
That night I realized that my fear of being hurt again had prevented me from loving fully. Johan deserved to get the best version of me, not the damaged one afraid to trust.
It took months more before I completely lowered my drawbridge. Months during which he waited patiently, never stopped showing me he was different. And when we finally decided to move in together, it was still with a part of me ready to flee if things went wrong.
Now, after almost two years together, I can't help but wonder: What if I had met him first? Before all the others. Before I learned to protect instead of trust. How different would our path have been?
If he had been the first, perhaps I would have more easily believed him when he said I was beautiful. Perhaps I would have allowed him to get to know me first – the real me, without all the layers of protection. Perhaps we might already be married, maybe even planning a family? I'll never know.
The scent of fresh coffee drifts into the room, and I hear his footsteps in the hallway. He appears in the doorway with two mugs, steam curling in the cold winter air.
""Morning, love,"" he says with that smile that still makes my heart skip a beat.
And suddenly I realize: Maybe it's good that I didn't meet him first. Because then I wouldn't understand the value of what we have. Then I wouldn't be grateful every day for the man who waited until I was ready to love. The man who made the effort to break through the walls. The man who still brings me coffee in bed every morning.
I take the mug from his hand and move over to make room. ""I'm glad you were the last one,"" I whisper, ""because it means you'll be the only one who remains.""
And when he slides in next to me, his arm around my shoulders, I know that the path we walked, though not always easy, was the right one to bring us here.",1,1741261340.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1j4tlu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1j4tlu7/team_building_pt_2/,Team Building Pt. 2,"I was being chased through an endless maze of putrid, ancient wooden doors. Some kind of glutinous entity was biting at my heels. Sweat poured profusely down my face as I shouted obscenities into the darkness.

“Fuck, fuck, fuck! Oh shit.”

Every door I pulled on was locked, dreadful sounds emitting from beyond. I had to find an exit. I rounded a corner, knowing the thing was creeping closer by the second. I could hear what sounded like whips covered in black oil, wiggling and searching behind me. 

I snuck a glance over my shoulder as I sprinted further down this seemingly endless hallway. Just in time to see a massive tendril snaking around the corner, followed by two dozen more. Two sanguine-colored eyes penetrated the darkness inside them with gleeful excitement. A horrific creature long forgotten by time willed itself fully into view. Its tendrils were spread wide now, licking and whipping every inch of the hallway as it bounded after me at a slow, steady crawl. They left behind a thickening, foul slime trail as it slithered ever closer, its murderous intent palpable.

I finally reached the end of the hallway—the last door to try. My last chance.

Locked.

I pounded on the door frantically.

“God fucking damn it!” I shrieked, to no one in particular.

I knelt, hands on my knees, wheezing through the offensive stench that hung heavy in the air, trying to catch my breath. The whipping of too many appendages grew closer, and the rancid scent grew more pervasive with each passing second. It smelled like someone had slurped up vomit and thrown it back up again.
There was nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide. This was it.

I turned from the door, steeling myself and accepting my fate. I raised my arms in front of me, mustering up all the strength I had left.

“COME ON!” I howled with everything I had down the nightmare alley.

The vociferous whipping sounds increased to an overwhelming frequency as the entity appeared before me in its unholy glory. The cracking and slithering of tendrils reverberated against everything around me. The walls seemed to fracture attempting to confine the monstrosity within its borders. I fell back into the door, grabbing my ears to keep them from exploding under the booming echo of horror.

Suddenly, the door behind me swung open, causing me to lose my balance and tumble out into the night air. The back of my head hit the pavement with a crack. 

I heard, in the blackness, the hulking wooden door slam closed with a gust of air.
A harrowing cackle erupted from the other side.

“Well done,” it echoed giddily through the door, and I felt something warm pool behind my head before everything went dark.

___



The call came in the middle of the night.

Unluckily for me, I had been something of a night owl since getting let go from my job a year earlier. The bills were piling up, and the meager unemployment I had been collecting wasn’t going far enough. At that point in my life, I would’ve taken anything that paid. And I did. I did everything I could to scrounge a living for myself—from painting houses to driving trucks for pay under the table. So, when the call came in the early hours on that Monday, I was already on my second cup of coffee, perusing the wanted ads out of pure desperation.

My cell phone began to ring, much to my confusion. A number I’d never seen before—or since, for that matter—flashed across the screen. I considered it for a moment and thought, fuck it.

I picked it up after the fourth ring and was greeted by an affable voice.

“Hello?” I said curiously.

“Is this Trenton, Cooper?” The voice actually said “comma.”

“Ugh, Cooper Trenton. Yes. Who is this, please?”

“Good morning, Mr. Trenton. This is Albrecht Von. I am the CEO of Dunwich and Co. My call this morning is to inquire if you would be so inclined to interview with us?”

I mean, technically, it was morning if you considered four a.m. to be morning. I personally considered it nighttime, but people in business keep weird hours. Who was I to judge? After all, I was awake as well—and desperate.

I scoured my mind for a memory of applying to the aforementioned Dunwich and Co., but the brain files came up short. I had applied to hundreds of jobs over the past year, so my forgetting one of them wasn’t necessarily outside the realm of possibility.

“Oh, good morning to you too, sir. I am very much interested in an interview,” I exaggerated. I had learned long ago not to shoot a gift horse in the mouth, and I was out of options.

“Positively wonderful. Please bring with you an open mind and a willingness to prove yourself. I will have my secretary email the particulars momentarily.” With that, the line clicked and died.

I found myself standing before an architectural marvel of a building made entirely of concrete the very next morning. It reminded me of Medusa’s hair, the way the sharp edges protruded every which way, almost like a crown. I had arrived fifteen minutes early—something I had done before every job interview over the last year. If it ever helped my case, I’ll never know for sure.

As I pushed through the uninviting aluminum door, I entered what could only be described as a small, innocuous lobby. Little more than an apathetic, tiny room greeted me, a stark contrast to the view from outside. Paint-chipped, monochromatic walls and a mundane desk with a frighteningly pale auburn-haired woman sat sentry ahead of me. Her head was down, almost like she was sleeping, with her hands flat on the desk. To my right was a row of decrepit wooden chairs and an ancient-looking wooden door. I glanced up at a dim, flickering dome light, which seemed to lure and release a family of moths in a never ending dance.

I hated to say it, but even with this place being creepy as all get-out, this wasn’t the worst place I’d interviewed at in the whirlwind that had been the last year of my life. Times were tough all over.

The lady behind the desk suddenly jerked her head toward me with an unnatural, eerie smile. She looked like one of those marionette dolls with the long lines down the side of her mouth. Her sudden movement caused me to stumble a step back. Her eyes were a dull, greyish hue, and it felt like she was looking but not seeing me.

“Name?” she asked bluntly.

“Hi, hello. Cooper Trenton. I’m here to—”

“To see Mr. Von. Have a seat,” she interrupted flatly. Her arm jerked robotically toward the chairs against the wall, then fell limply back down with a thud onto the desk. Her eyes turned away from me, and her head slowly moved back down. The smile never fell from her face.

I took a seat without another word, eyeing her cautiously.

I waited for another fifteen minutes. The woman never lifted her head again until a smartly dressed man with slicked-back blonde hair and piercing green eyes walked in. His suit looked more expensive than the entire lobby.

“Mr. Trenton, it is an absolute treat to… meet you. Albrecht Von.” I stood to grab his extended hand. “I hope we didn’t keep you waiting too long.”

The only thing that was too long was his index fingernail, which was turning a slight shade of purple. The woman behind the desk twitched in my peripheral.

“No, sir. Not long at all,” I answered. He noticed my eyes drift to the woman behind the desk. I thought maybe she was watching something on her phone, but from what I could see, her desk was completely empty. Not even a pen was anywhere in sight.

His eyes shifted for a second to the woman, and I could swear I saw them turn a dark black, but when he turned them back on me, they were a bright green again.

The pale woman just continued to smile at us.

“Thank you, Audrey,” Mr. Von said almost expectantly. He studied me for a moment, and as the moment passed us by he continued. “If you’ll follow me, please, Mr. Trenton.” He opened the ancient wooden door and flicked his index finger over his shoulder, as if to say, this way.

He closed it gently behind us and glided across the floor. The hallway we were in seemed familiar somehow, like I had been there in a dream of a dream. I followed closely behind Mr. Von, passing closed wooden doors on either side with faint sounds coming from beyond.

I almost ran into him as we reached yet another wooden door at the end of the winding hallway. He pushed it open with ease and ushered me inside with wide, eager eyes and a grin plastered too wide on his face. I could feel him oozing anticipation—for what, I had no idea.

As we stepped inside, I felt a slight gasp escape me. There were gorgeous paintings adorning every wall of the room, floor to ceiling. I was momentarily impressed by the sheer volume of these beautiful creations, all gleaming under the warm lights. As I scanned the portraits, one in particular paralyzed my eyes—and then my mind. It was a portly man in his mid-forties, saluting in a too-big sailor’s uniform. It stirred in my brain like someone had taken a whisk to the back of my head, searching desperately to find a connection. A devastating migraine hit me like a battering ram, wave after wave of pain. My eyes shut tight against my will, unknowingly pressing them together as if that would somehow squeeze my brain out through my eyelids and end the agony.

Vivid images flashed like a reel in my mind, over and over again.

a painting of a knight kneeling before a hooded creature.

An auburn-haired girl, 

an armory, 

I grabbed the back of my head, feeling a pitted scar running six inches vertically down to the nape of my neck.

Mr. Von quietly locked the door behind him, positioned himself in front of another door on the opposite side of the room, and turned on his heels to face my pitiful, shaking form.

I forced my eyes open through the agony, just in time to see Mr. Von’s index finger slowly rising to meet his shit eating grin. 

It was a sickly midnight color, and several inches longer than when he’d beckoned me to follow him only moments ago.

Something about that finger felt so familiar to me—something long buried in my mind.

“Welcome back, Cooper,” Mr. Von said excitedly.

1j4tiht,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1j4tiht/the_restaurant/,The Restaurant.,"Food, the great equalizer, aside from war and conflict, everything that lives and breathes survives by consuming something. 

Humans, have taken this to a very artistic degree. 

Don't get me wrong, the hallmark of a cultured civilization in the stars can be seen through the food they can provide in the far reaches of their territory. 

So color my surprise when my ship docked at a Human-majority space station in Federation territory. 

I only ever heard from my fellow crewmates that Humans are warriors of great renown, and that their MREs were heavily coveted to the point that Humans can get defectors from enemy armies just by bribing them with it. 

So by that logic, their normal food must be good right? 

But I was hesitant to enter a Human restaurant, I have not seen any humans in the station but I was told they are very intimidating. 

Then I was colored surprised when my grumbling stomach caught the attention of a Human who basically shouted at me to eat at his restaurant. 

It was not what I expected, lacquered wooden interior, the scent of coffee beans and various soups and stews in large pots over a gas stove, next to a fire extinguisher. 

It whet my appetite and I looked at the menu. 

The human asked me if there was something my species could not eat. 

By the goddess' breast milk I was happy I'm omnivorous, a fact I gladly shared. 

He laughed happily and recommended me meat-stuffed cabbage rolls and a plate of pesto pasta. 

I ordered them and waited happily. 

A free cup of coffee and water with every individual order. 

I smelled the coffee, it smelled genuine, not that heavily synthesized processed stuff that is so bad that even Instant Coffee would be heaven compared to it. 

I stirred and licked the spoon, the satisfying bitter taste moved me to tears. 

I cup the coffee in my hand, it's warmth permeating my hands, after days of moving cold preserved goods from the transports. 

I take my first sip and this coffee made me feel so alive. 

I enjoy half of my coffee when my food arrives. 

The scent of the cabbage hid the delicious fatty sweet smell of the meat. 

Pasta was cooked al-dente, the sauce draped over like a tender blanket. 

Oh how I enjoyed the meal, veggies and meat pierced the monotony of my tongue as pasta slithered down my throat with the delicious sauce pleasuring my brain cells. 

By the time I finished everything and drank my water, I felt so relieved.

There was a girl sitting next to me, with a few of her friends. I’m not sure if it was attraction or something else, but I found myself inexplicably drawn to her without even speaking a word. I couldn’t help but notice the way she adjusted her hair with her fingers, and how calm and composed she seemed while watching the screen.

I really wanted to talk to her, but I became nervous. I’m the kind of person who never has the courage to approach a girl, and this situation was no different. But then, towards the end of the movie, an emotional scene came on, and I noticed she had been crying for quite a while. It made me want to offer her something—maybe water or a tissue—but I had nothing with me.

Later, my friends and I went to the bookstore in the same mall, and by chance, she and her friends were there too. I don’t know if it was just coincidence or something more, but we didn’t speak again. One of my friends was in a rush, so we had to leave the bookstore abruptly.

Now, three days have passed, and I can’t stop thinking about her. I’ve forgotten what her face looked like, but I still remember the way she made me feel. So, to the girl I saw that day: if you happen to read this, I just want to say that you are absolutely gorgeous. That’s all. ❤️

Sometime ago, I tried Aldi's version of Hazelnut or Chocolate coffee which were in small 50g bottles. They had a good balance between taste, not too much sugar and still tasted like coffee.

They disappeared of the shelf and I have been trying other brands since but have not liked any of them. Recently ordered beanies coffee of Amazon and was disappointed. Tbh I don't what I expected of cookie dough flavored coffee but perhaps I got too experimental. 

So I have come here for recommendations

Today, I felt productive for the first time I entered university. Ever since I entered university, I didn't really feel great studying. I commute from home to university every single day. I'm forced to wake up 4:30 AM in the morning to undergo an hour of travel time to university that starts at 7 AM (some days end at 7 PM), because of this reason (and an adaptation that I carried over from high school) I also skip breakfast. I live with my brother who's currently in high school. Being the eldest sibling between us two, I more or less also do majority of the chores at home (washing the dishes, cleaning, picking up my after my brother's messes, etc). Studying in a course I didn't really like and more or less feel lonely at school. So you could imagine what my daily life in university is like.

Today, as classes were carried out online. I did the chores, etc. I went to my local starbucks to study. After a few hours, I felt great. It's different from the feeling of ""Ooooo, I learned something"" but like the title states ""I feel wondeful! I was productive today"". I don't know why I have this feeling. Maybe it's the fact that I got an iPad so I no longer have to carry a laptop to school, maybe it's the fact that I got coffee, maybe its the fact that I'm slowly starting to appreciate and enjoy my course,maybe it's the the general fact that my quality of life with regards to studying atleast were better. But with all of that said, I definitely feel better. I feel like I'm ACTUALLY gonna be looking forward to the lecture tomorrow and would no longer just attend for the graded attendance. I no longer feel like shit everytime I take breaks. I just feel bettter, I'm starting to romanticize studying a cafe, going to university, learning about the various medical conditions affecting our daily movements.

I hope everyone would feel the same, and while studying will always be a necessity even post-bachelor's degree (yes, even after university and that will never change in the near future) I hope everyone would also come to enjoy and romanticize it!

Could it be yeast?,"I felt symptoms coming on early jan and took a 7 day course of nitrofurantoin, but i didn’t go to the doctors or get a urinalysis culture (silly i know). After the course the UTI seemed to clear up but I was left with this awful burning sensation in my urethra which is constantly there 24/7 and this occupies a lot of my mind. 

Went to a sexual health clinic and they ruled out lots of other causes eg HIV, Gonhorrea, Chlamydia, Hep B/C, Tricomoniasis, Syphlysis, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. Which was great - but I didn’t really think it was any of those things to begin with. 

They also tested my urine with a dipstick (negative) and looked for BV and yeast (also negative). However, I had been using canesten cream quite often in an attempt to control the burn so assume this would affect the result. They also told me that yeast infections can sometimes affect the urethra rather than the vagina, because I don’t have any itching or burning there, it’s literally just in my pee hole.

So my question is: could this be a yeast issue in the urethra? Has anyone had experience with this? 

The burning pain had eased up for a couple of weeks (cut out sparkling water and coffee which seemed to help) but it’s back again and it’s just so constant I don’t know what to do 😔 

I’m considering just taking one of the OTC yeast pills you can get (fluconazole) but is it bad to take if there’s no infection? Like would that affect good yeast in other areas of the body? I’m hoping it would fix everything. 

I’m also worried that maybe I didn’t need that initial course of ABX and there was no infection, just cystitis maybe. Could taking a 7 day course of nitro without infection present damage my urethra? I’m guessing not as nitro is used as a low dose preventative ABX for months at a time but could be wrong.

Can't we reduce this concept of consciousness to mere self-reflection, which our brain is capable of?

I believe that everything we attribute to consciousness can be reduced to physical processes in the brain, and there’s no need to introduce some additional, non-material entity. I can't even fathom what people mean when they discuss something non-material. There is nothing to separate from the material world if it doesn't exist. For me, it looks like there is no sense even to use the word ""exist"" for something non-material.

The concept of consciousness can be important in some particular way. Let's imagine that consciousness is an illusion that arises from complex neural processes in the brain. For example, like a mirage in the desert: it’s not real, but we perceive it, and that perception affects us. Similarly, consciousness doesn’t exist as a separate entity, but the ""feeling"" of it plays a role in our lives.

And there is one more question. I don’t understand what qualia are and why they are considered something special. Qualia are the subjective qualities of our experience, like the feeling of seeing red or the taste of coffee. Why can’t we attribute these qualia to the physical processes occurring in the brain? Why do philosophers say there’s an ""explanatory gap"" between physical processes and subjective experience? 

We can't explain it now, but assigning our feelings, perceptions, and self-reflection to something external to the physical world feels not the right way to approach the question.",0,1741260024.0,askphilosophy,1,0.33,False

1j4sy1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingstonOntario/comments/1j4sy1c/kudos_to_kcff_for_the_jay_baruchel_talk_and/,Kudos to KCFF for the Jay Baruchel talk and inspiring me to 'buy Canadian' with my media choices.,"I went to this kind of on a whim; I really wasn't expecting that much from a guy I remember mostly for the good but short-lived sitcom ""Undeclared"", two *Goon* movies and being a third-stringer in movies like *This Is The End*. Younger extended family members are super into *How to Train Your Dragon*. 

But [Baruchel delivered a barnstormer of a talk](https://kingcanfilmfest.com/2024/jay-baruchel/) about Canadian identity; lots of ground covered, but the point that he really hammered home is that we're half-annexed already, culturally: the vast bulk of the music we listen to and movies and TV shows we watch are American. There are zero Canadian films playing at Landmark right now. Pick any streamer with a ""top 10 in Canada"" list and I'll bet dollars to Coffee Way donuts that 80% of the shows and movies aren't Canadian. 

It feels weird to say ""Jay Baruchel changed my life,"" but it was a real wake-up call for me. I'm making a real effort to change my media consumption; dropping a lot of kind of brain-dead ""well, this is on"" streaming choices to re-prioritize Canadian ideas and Canadian voices. 

(this is also an extension of the general 'buy Canadian' thinking -- it's not just about checking the label on the ketchup, it's about what stories and values we're 'buying' every day with those choices). 

 I've found the r/BuyCanadian wiki (https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/wiki/directories/) really helpful for this, as well as the always amazing [Kingston-Frontenac library system](https://www.kfpl.ca). 

This isn't a purity test; we've all got our own stuff going on. 

Me, though -- I'm really grateful to KCFF for bringing Baruchel here, and to Baruchel for dropping what was going to be a ""my career doing acting stuff"" with host Elamin Abdelmahmoud to deliver an impassioned and off-the-cuff defense of Canadian culture. Literally life-altering. I'm grateful.

We've gone on one date, and I had a great time. We went to a bar, he paid for drinks, and he got me home safely. He asked me to get coffee in two weeks, and I agreed. But now that it's approaching, I'm doubting myself.

He only texts me once or twice a day, always saying he's busy with work. I feel a bit unappreciated—like if he really liked me, he would put more effort into talking to me.

What should I do? Should I go on the second date and see if things improve, or should I cancel? We haven’t even exchanged numbers, he doesn’t have social media, and we’re still only talking on Tinder.

Now, for advice: If you’re already feeling unappreciated and doubting things before the second date, that’s a red flag. Some people are genuinely busy, but consistent low effort can mean low interest. If you're curious, you could go on the date and see if his actions match his words. But if you feel like you're the only one putting in effort, it might not be worth your time. What’s your gut telling you?

1j4swcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j4swcc/i_saw_you_outside_last_night/,I saw you outside last night.,"It was my nephews fifth birthday, and I had been pretty much absent the majority of the day. Sitting in my room smoking pot, and playing video games. In turn there's not much to recount of the day prior to the events of that night. Somehow my bother and sisters convinced my mom to let all six of the kids stay over. They all slept on a king size air mattress in the living room all but one, my nephew. He slept on the couch right next to the big window. 

Again I was in my room paying no mind to the outside world. Just stoned and playing some bullshit video game with my buddy Monty. Sometime around three or four AM I got a bit hungry so I snuk into the kitchen to grab a bag of chips. The bag crinkling the entire journey back to my room. After what felt like days I finally make it to the confines of my bedroom. Where I hear laughing coming from my headset. I throw it on to see what's so funny. ""Dude there's no fucking way you didn't wake somebody up."" Monty snickering through his words. ""Bullshit, you heard that bag through the mic"" I replied concerned that he may be right. ""Not the bag dip shit, the fucking scratching noise."" Laughing harder than before. 

""Monty, what scratching noise?"" I knew there was no way he heard me, because I was on the opposite end of the house. ""Dude what scratching noise?"" I interrupted his laughter. He finally started to calm down and reply to me. "" It was so loud man, it sounded like you were scratching glass."" He was still laughing slightly. ""Monty that wasn't me dude. Let me go check on the kids."" I took me headset off and sat it down in the floor. Muting it so there was no sound coming from my room. Creeping toward the living room I started to hear it. The sound of glass being rubbed by clammy fingers. 

Approaching the threshold of the hallway the noise is interrupted by the sound of a dog barking, then what sounded like claws on concrete. Sprinting away like a cat that had been spooked. If a cat weighed as much as a bear. I turn the corner and it looks like everyone is still asleep. With that I head back to my room to let Monty know that all is well. "" I think I'm gonna hop off for the night. It's like 4:30 and I'm fucking pooped."" I yawned feeling like I could drop any second. ""Alright buddy I'll see ya tomorrow."" Monty Begrudgingly sighed into his mic. ""Later bubs."" I turned off my console and fell into bed. 

The next day I woke up around early afternoon. In a daze I waddled my way into the kitchen to grab a cup off six hour old coffee and to steal a cigarette from my dad's pack of Marlboro black 100's. On my way outside to smoke said cigarette my nephew walks up to me "" I saw you outside last night."" He muttered while rubbing his eyes. ""You must've dreamed it little buddy I was inside all night."" I said holding back concern. "" no I saw you, you were like this."" Mirroring what he saw. He had his hands raised just above his head, his mouth wide open and his head tilted downward. 

To put it into perspective at the time. I was borderline anorexic and I had just shaved my head. So what he saw was a tall skinny bald figure. That had it's hands pressed on the window. Staring at him with it's mouth wide open. ",7,1741258438.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

A couple things I'm curious about:



* What's been helpful for addressing your fatigue?

* Anyone else having trouble sleeping no matter how exhausted you are?

* How does physical exercise affect your fatigue? (I can do a workout and feel totally fine during/immediately after, but I absolutely tank over the course of the day and take days to recover from the fatigue)

* Have you found certain things affect your ability to sleep and/or your stamina throughout the day? (I'm currently testing if cutting coffee helps... no luck yet)

* I keep seeing posts about anti-inflammatory diets-- any luck with this? Can someone explain further?

* I never had brain imaging done... would this provide any insight?

It's hard to find someone nearby with similar interests as mine so I'm hoping someone out here will relate.

Apart from anime, I read manga, I also play games, currently in a WoW and otome games phase (LaD). I read books, both fictional (horror, dark romance, light romance, fantasy) and non fictional (mindset, self improvement).

Also, I have like a gazillion memes that are begging to be shared.

I'm really into movies and TV shows, currently rewatching Supernatural (Dean girlie btw).

Other hobbies I have are travel, writing, drawing, photography and learning to homestead (gardening, homemade products for maintenance, homemade recipes). I am absolutely not a party girl but I like having an evening out with a group of friends.

I'm from Croatia but would love to connect with anyone anywhere who is interested in forming a meaningful friendship, hop on a call sometime, go out for coffees, shopping, brunches and stuff if distance isn't an issue.

Please is this normal? If not, what should I do? I have tried to search all the troubleshooting guides I found and it looks like some kind of ghosting, but before I try to tighten the belts, I want to know if it can help with this problem at all. Thanks for any help or clue!

It wasn’t the air, though it felt heavier than it should have been. It wasn’t the lighting, though the dim yellow bulbs flickered as if struggling to stay awake. It wasn’t even the silence, though it was the kind that pressed against my ears, thick and expectant. No, it was something else—something deeper, something unseen. An unsettling sensation crawled under my skin, cold and unshakable, like the walls themselves were watching, whispering in a language I couldn’t hear. I had walked into a place that didn’t want me there.

The landlady, Mrs. Carter, stood behind the counter, her frail hands folded neatly in front of her. Her face was lined with deep wrinkles, as though time had carved its story into her skin. Her gray eyes—dull, unreadable—rested on me in a way that made my stomach tighten. She said nothing at first, just reached under the counter and handed me a small brass key, along with a neatly folded piece of paper.

Her fingers lingered on the edges of the paper as I took it from her.

""Read this carefully,"" she said, her voice quiet, measured. ""And follow every rule.""

There was no warmth in her words, no unnecessary pleasantries. Just a warning wrapped in a simple instruction.

I hesitated, glancing toward the wall near the entrance. A faded list of rules was taped there, its edges curling with age, the ink smudged and uneven. I barely glanced at it, assuming it was the usual—No Smoking, No Loud Music, No Guests After 10 PM. I should have paid more attention. I should have stopped and read every word.

Instead, I unfolded the paper in my hands, and as my eyes scanned the list, my stomach twisted into a tight knot.

**Boarding House Rules:**

1. **Lock your door before midnight. Do not open it for anyone until sunrise.**
2. **If you hear knocking past midnight, ignore it. No matter who they claim to be, they are not real.**
3. **Always greet the old man in Room 7 if you see him in the hallway. If he doesn’t greet you back, hide in the nearest room immediately.**
4. **Do not eat food left outside your door. No one in this house leaves food for others.**
5. **If you wake up and feel someone watching you, do not move. Do not speak. Close your eyes until morning.**
6. **If you hear the landlady humming past midnight, do not look out of your window. Do not let her know you are awake.**

My hands tightened around the paper, the words blurring slightly as I reread them. My mouth felt dry.

""This isn’t a joke, is it?"" I asked, my voice quieter than I had intended.

Mrs. Carter didn’t answer immediately. She only studied me, her expression blank, before shaking her head once.

""Follow the rules, You’ll be fine."" she repeated. 

And just like that, she turned and walked away, her slow, deliberate steps echoing down the hallway.

I stood there, my heart hammering. The paper felt heavier in my hands now. My mind told me it was ridiculous—some weird tradition, an old superstition meant to scare new tenants. But deep down, somewhere in the part of my brain that still clung to instinct, I knew—**I had just made a terrible mistake by moving in.**

I went to My room. It was small but clean. A bed, a wooden desk, a single chair near the window. The walls were a dull beige, bare except for a single painting of a forest that looked too dark, too deep. I ran a hand along the desk’s surface. Dust-free. Everything was strangely spotless, as if no one had truly lived here before.

The walls were thin. I could hear faint shuffling, the quiet murmurs of my neighbors settling in for the night. A floorboard creaked somewhere in the hallway. I swallowed hard and double-checked my door, twisting the lock with a sharp click. Then, I climbed into bed, the folded paper resting on the nightstand beside me. The rules ran through my mind like a looping whisper.

I wasn’t sure how long I lay there, staring at the ceiling. At some point, my eyelids grew heavy. Sleep crept in. The silence of the room wrapped around me like a thick fog.

And then—I heard something.

**A Knock**

Again and again.

My eyes snapped open. A cold wave of fear crashed through me.

A voice followed.

""Hey, man, it’s Adam. My key isn't working. Can you open up?""

Adam. My next-door neighbor. I had met him earlier—friendly, talkative, the kind of guy who could make any place feel normal. He had been here for three months. He had smiled when he introduced himself. He had **seemed real.**

But the second rule echoed in my mind.

**If you hear knocking past midnight, ignore it. No matter who they claim to be, they are not real.**

I gripped the blanket, my breath shallow. My heartbeat thudded against my ribs.

**Knock. Knock. Knock.**

Adam’s voice again. This time, there was a slight edge to it.

""Come on, man. I just need you to open the door for a second. Please.""

I almost answered. Almost.

But something was wrong. His voice—it sounded close, **too close**, like he was whispering right against the wood. And yet, there was something else. A flatness. A hollowness. Like an imitation of a voice, someone trying to **sound like Adam** but failing in the smallest, most unnatural ways.

I clenched my fists, forcing myself to stay silent.

The knocking stopped.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

For the rest of the night, I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, waiting for the sun to rise.

The next morning, I stepped into the hallway, feeling the weight of exhaustion pressing on me.

I hadn’t slept. Not really. Every creak of the floor, every distant sound in the walls, every whisper of wind outside had kept me frozen beneath my blanket, listening—**waiting**—for something I couldn't see. When morning finally came, it didn’t feel like relief. It felt like a **temporary** escape, like something was letting me go, just for a little while.

The hallway was quiet, bathed in dull gray light filtering in from a small, dust-covered window at the end of the corridor. I turned toward the kitchen, the thought of coffee the only thing keeping me upright. And then—

I saw him.

**The old man from Room 7.**

He stood completely still in the middle of the hallway, his frail frame wrapped in a tattered, oversized sweater that hung off his shoulders like it belonged to someone else. His skin was pale, almost gray, stretched too thin over sharp cheekbones. His lips were cracked, and his eyes—dark, sunken—**hollow.** They stared at me, unblinking.

The air shifted. A chill ran up my spine, sharp and immediate.

I forced myself to speak. ""Good morning.""

The words felt small, insignificant against the weight of the silence between us.

He didn’t respond.

My throat tightened.

**Always greet the old man in Room 7. If he doesn’t greet you back, hide immediately.**

Third Rule flashed in my mind.

My pulse quickened. I glanced around, searching for the nearest door, calculating how fast I could reach it. The hallway stretched longer than it had before, or maybe that was just my fear twisting reality.

Seconds dragged. The silence felt alive, pressing against my skin.

Then—finally—he moved.

A slow, deliberate nod. No words, no expression. Just that single motion before he turned, shuffling toward his door.

I let out a shaky breath.

**I had followed the rule.**

But as his door clicked shut behind him, a cold thought crawled into my mind—**what would have happened if I hadn’t?**

Well, shaking off that clingy feeling, I went to work.

That evening, I returned from work, exhausted.

The day had been long, but my mind had been longer. I had spent most of it replaying the morning, the old man’s face, the weight of that silence. I told myself I was overreacting. It was just an old man. Just a weird set of rules. That was all.

But when I reached my door, I stopped.

A plate of food sat neatly on the floor. A bowl of soup and a slice of bread.

My stomach twisted, hunger gnawing at me after skipping breakfast and barely touching lunch. My first thought was **maybe Mrs. Carter left it.** Maybe it was some sort of welcome gesture.

And then my fingers curled into fists as I repeated the Rule Number–4 in my head.

**Do not eat food left outside your door. No one in this house leaves food for others.**

I swallowed hard.

The hallway was empty.

I bent down, hesitating before picking up the plate. The ceramic was cool, the silver lid covering the bowl gleaming under the dim hallway light. The smell of something familiar, something faintly metallic, drifted up.

My unease deepened.

I carried the plate to the kitchen, every step heavier than the last. I wasn’t going to eat it—**obviously**—but I needed to see what was inside.

With a slow breath, I lifted the lid.

**The stench hit me instantly.**

Rotting meat. Foul, wet, **wrong**. My stomach lurched, bile rising in my throat.

This wasn’t soup. It was something thick, dark, clotted in strange, pulsing lumps. Something **moved** beneath the surface, shifting sluggishly like it was alive but struggling to stay that way.

I gagged, my hands trembling as I **hurled** the plate into the trash, the bowl shattering against the inside of the bin. The stench lingered, curling into my nostrils, clinging to the back of my throat.

I turned to leave.

And then—I saw him.

**The old man from Room 7.**

Standing in the hallway.

Watching me.

His face was blank, unreadable. His dark eyes never blinked.

Then—slowly, deliberately—he **nodded once.**

And walked away.

That night, I lay in bed, every muscle in my body was tense.

I had locked the door. I had checked it twice. I had pulled the blanket up to my chin like it could protect me from whatever lurked beyond these walls. But none of that mattered. Not really. Because something was **wrong** in this house.

And then, at exactly **3:12 AM**, I heard it.

A soft humming, drifting through the hallway like a lullaby meant for something **else**.

My stomach twisted. I knew that tune.

I had heard it earlier that day—Mrs. Carter, humming to herself as she wiped the counter, her voice light and distant. 

**It had seemed harmless then.** But now?

Now, it feels **different**.

The sound grew clearer, threading its way through the thin walls, curling into the cracks of my room like smoke. It was calm, slow—**too slow**, like someone drawing out each note deliberately.

And, The sixth rule says.

**If you hear the landlady humming past midnight, do not look out of your window. Do not let her know you are awake.**

I gripped my blanket, my pulse hammering in my ears. **Don’t look. Don’t move.**

The humming grew louder & **Closer.**

And then—**footsteps.**

Soft, measured, dragging lightly across the wooden floor outside my room. Each step deliberate, stretching out the distance between them, like whoever was walking was **listening** for something.

They stopped—**Right outside my door.**

My breath caught in my throat.

The door. **Locked. It was locked.**

But the footsteps didn’t leave.

And then—the doorknob **rattled.**

A slow, testing turn. **Once. Twice.**

My entire body locked up.

I clenched my eyes shut, forcing myself not to move, not to breathe too loud, not to **exist** in that moment. Maybe if I stayed still enough, she would go away.

And then, as suddenly as it had started, The humming **stopped.**

The air in the room felt suffocating, thick with something unseen.

For a long, agonizing moment—**silence.**

And then—

A whisper.

Soft. Right outside the door.

**""I know you’re awake.""**

A cold shiver crawled down my spine, sinking deep into my bones.

I didn’t react. I didn’t move.

I couldn’t.

Seconds stretched into eternity.

Then—finally—**footsteps again.**

Moving away.

Slow.

Measured.

The humming started up once more, fading—drifting down the hallway, melting into the night.

I lay there, frozen, staring into the darkness until morning.

By the next evening, I had made up my mind. **I was leaving.**

I couldn’t stay in this house—not after last night, not after the rules kept proving themselves real.

I shoved my clothes into my bag, my hands shaking, my mind screaming at me to hurry. **Just get out. Don’t look back. Don’t question it. Just leave.**

But as I stepped into the hallway, a cold wave of dread washed over me.

I **froze.**

At the far end of the hall, the old man from Room 7 stood perfectly still.

His frail frame seemed smaller in the dim light, his hollow eyes locked onto me. **Waiting. Watching.**

I swallowed hard. **Greet him. Say something.**

""Good evening,"" I forced out, my voice tight.

Silence.

He didn’t move.

He didn’t blink.

He didn’t **greet me back.**

My stomach twisted violently.

**If he doesn’t greet you back, hide in the nearest room immediately.**

I turned, heart hammering, scanning for an open door—**any door.**

But before I could move—

**The hallway lights flickered.**

A deep, wet breathing sound slithered through the air, thick and unnatural, coming from everywhere and nowhere all at once.

And then—

Something shifted in the shadows.

The space at the end of the hall **stretched**, as if the walls were bending, pulling apart. **Something was there. Something big. Something wrong.**

The nearest door creaked open.

I didn’t hesitate.

I **ran.**

I dove inside and **slammed** the door shut behind me.

From Outside—**A Dragging Sound Came.**

Slow. Heavy. **Scraping against the floor.**

Something was moving down the hallway.

And then—

**Knock. Knock.** 

I squeezed my eyes shut. **No. Not again.**

A voice, muffled through the door—

**""Hey, man, it’s Adam. My key isn’t working. Can you open up?""**

I clamped a hand over my mouth. **Not real. It’s not real.**

The knocking didn’t stop.

**Knock. Knock.** 

My breath hitched in my throat, every muscle in my body screaming **“stay silent”.**

Then—

A pause.

A whisper.

Right against the door.

**""I know you’re awake.""**

The lights in the room **flickered.**

And then—

The door handle **started to turn.**

**The handle twisted.**

The door swung open.

And something—**something unseen, something cold, something hungry—grabbed me.**

The air **rushed** out of my lungs as an invisible force **dragged** me forward.

The walls twisted, stretched, swallowed me whole—

**Darkness.**

**Pressure.**

Like I had fallen into something deep, something endless, something that didn’t want to let go.

I **tried** to scream.

But there was no sound.

No air.

No **me.**

I don’t remember what happened after that.

But when I woke up in the morning… my room was still there.

My bags—still packed.

The bed—untouched.

But **I** was gone.

Outside **Room 7,** a fresh piece of paper was taped to the wall.

The rules—**unchanged.**

Except for one.

A new line—written in dark, uneven letters, pressed deep into the page.

We’ve known each other for 2 years as we met at the start of college, and in our little friend group that consists of about 10ish people we are the closest. My passion for her has grown so much in the time that I’ve met her and gotten to know more about her. We have gone on many friendly dates to restaurants and coffee shops and we have made that a routine thing. We share so many interest like our music, taste in films, food, and fashion sense. We have even gotten matching tattoos together. Whenever either of us has something happen to us we immediately share it to each other. She has only been in two relationships and in both relationships she was only used for sex and her body. I have been in a similar situation where someone will be with me just for sex. But I don’t care at all about her body, don’t get me wrong she has an incredible one but it’s not what I’m into. I’m into the way that she talks with me and the way that we share jokes. I know that If I was in a relationship and we never had any sex or I never even saw her naked I would still be incredibly in love with her because I’m in love with her soul and her being more than her physical body. I feel that I could give her anything she wants or needs in a relationship and I wanna tell her about my feelings, but I’m so afraid that if I do that I’ll lose and if I do lose her than there’s no point in me being in this existence.
