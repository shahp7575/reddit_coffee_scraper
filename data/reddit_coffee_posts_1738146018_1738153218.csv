1icsgs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1icsgs1/to_anyone_recently_upgrading_their_cpu/,To anyone recently upgrading their CPU.,"I was wondering if anyone here has recently upgraded their CPU to a current gen model comming from something like a Coffee Lake intel CPU like the 8700k or 9900k. Did this improve your preformance in the game regarding (micro)stutters? I know the game it quite old by now and the engine and the way the game renders is not optimal and will always keep some stutters when moving through the Grids. This is also btw the only time stutter is visable on my end when sprinting through the world. Otherwise, its always steady. CPU util is around 30% with my 3080ti pushing close to max (80-90%) (ENB + mods ect..) 

Im asking because my CPU is above the recommended specs at the time and id like to know if going any newer will be any help reducing stutters or if i would still be limited to what the engine can handle.",1,1738153048.0,fo4,0,1.0,False

1icsg7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/seekamari/comments/1icsg7m/what_is_regressive_overload/,What is Regressive Overload?,"The earliest points of my journey start with this attempt to quantify what is happening in modern times.  
Obesity, mental health issues, and cancers are all increasing, predominantly as a result of our toxic environment.

Poor sleep, stress, censorship, and dopamine manipulation are systems of the 21st century that, quite clearly, act as mechanisms for the devolution of humankind.

As human beings, we are the only species on the planet with the conscious potential for improvement.

**Progressive overload** is a well-known principle in weight training, but it applies across every aspect of human growth.  
Consistently challenging your mind, skills, and body within your genetic limitations leads to improvement.

But if this is true, there must be an inverse.

# Regressive Overload: The Silent Erosion of Growth

It’s **Regressive Overload**—the slow accumulation of **chronobiological and neurobiological dysfunction** that erodes **cognitive function and physical health over time**. It describes the residual effects of daily stressors—environmental, psychological, and behavioral—that gradually wear down resilience, mental clarity, and overall well-being.

**State management** is a **neurobiological framework** designed to counteract regressive overload, allowing individuals to regulate cognitive states and biological rhythms for optimal function.

# Key Aspects of Regressive Overload:

**Neurobiological Overload**

* Excessive stimulation of the brain’s reward and stress systems—through dopamine manipulation from technology, social media, and food—creates an environment that initiates a downward spiral for the human body.
* Results in decreased neuroplasticity, decision fatigue, and impaired executive function.

It is this impairment of cognitive environment that disruption natural biological rhythms leading to Inconsistent sleep-wake cycles, artificial light exposure, and irregular eating patterns disrupt natural biological rhythms. Hormonal imbalances (e.g., cortisol and melatonin misalignment), reducing the body's ability to recover.

The Residual natural of regressive overload is the Cumulative Sleep Deficiency: In essence when you impact the day you impact the night and the result of this is that you have already impacted tomorrow. 

Ever wake up after a terrible night's sleep, slammed an early coffee, craved carbohydrates or not have the emotional capacity to say no to the sweet thing. 

That is regressive overload. 

**The system around you is designed to extract profit from you. When it purposely manipulates your dopamine system, it degrades your control and impairs your ability to make rational decisions. It constantly pushes individuals to optimize and hustle, but without understanding regressive overload, the pursuit of progress becomes self-defeating. Over time, unmanaged overload leads to burnout, sleep disorders, and diminished performance in all areas of life.**

You are not designed to run at full capacity indefinitely.

The brain and your biological rhythms follow a natural ebb and flow—periods of **input and output**, of **manipulation and consolidation** of information. Ignoring this cycle leads to cognitive and physiological breakdown.  
  
We can all better manage regressive overload by understanding STATE.

1icse90,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/comments/1icse90/story_rant_i_miss_the_actually_good_storylines_in/,Story Rant. I miss the actually good storylines in Tekken,"Not only that, but that they were taken more seriously too. The world of Tekken has its funny and weird moments that wouldn't make sense in the real world, and i appreciate that they exist, but I liked when they were taken seriously despite the fact.

The story of Tekken 8 disappointed me to say the least. Not only through the main story but even through character interactions that don't make sense, arent developed or aren't explained. 

All of a sudden Lars, Leroy and everybody else from the resistance treat Jin like the good Mishima as if Jin didn't cause World War 3 just a few months ago story wise. That's just stupid. Did everybody get and amnesia and just forget the millions of lives he took?

Heihachi Mishima survived, which makes the whole story of Tekken 7 and all of that emotional buildup just pointless. Instead of actually bringing back Heihachi in the story too, just see what you did a few years ago in Tekken 7 Bandai Namco with Kazumi, and make him a memory of when Kazuya fought him. We get to play as Heihachi, you get to make a ton of money, it can make sense in the story as it did in Tekken 7 and everyone is happy, It's a win win for everybody.

Law for some reason looking younger than his own son, decided to aid Kazuya in destroying the world because, he wants money? He was mad at Paul that he didn't split the money with him from the tournament prize and so he decided to help Kazuya destory the whole world, because he wants money? Yeah ok.

Lili and Azucena have a beef with each other because, one likes tea and the other likes coffee. Ok? No other reason? Fine.

Asuka is once again, completely irrelevant to the story even though she was set up to be a very important character. She has the healing/cleansing powers of her mother, Jun Kazama, that help with the Devil Gene, but ever since Tekken 5 there hasn't been a **single** mention of her having those super powers, nor has she been relevant to the story since then.

Claudio joined the resistance and became good all of a sudden, even though in my opinion he was a much more interesting character when he was evil/nefarious and wanted to take advantage of Xiaoyu to find Jin, but that storyline was thrown out the window because, again, all of a sudden he is a good guy. Great.

King's and Steve's interactions are sort of interesting, but they haven't been developed in the story, because the story focuses entirely on the Mishimas 90% of the time, which yeah the Mishimas of course are cool, they are awesome, but why can't we get a bit more ipnteresting character interactions from the rest of the cast? Show their own stories, show more of them!

To give credit to Bandai Namco, Reina is the most interesting newcomer from Tekken 8, and i was really excited with her. Though her coolness factor was reduced because shocker, she herself has the devil gene which I don't know how that happened, and I **really** wish it didn't happen, but fine. What's a few more interesting storylines being neutered to being more lame.

I could go on and on but i believe I've proved my point. In general my issue is that Bandai Namco has a genuine problem with developing these character's stories or doing anything interesting with them at all, and they leave a lot to be desired. Some character have unfortunately have stayed with the same storyline for what has been **decades** and it's genuinely so tiring to see them undeveloped. Especially when videogames nowadays take years to develop, and the bigger they get, the more expectations rise, and when competitors do it better, you need to step it up.

Hell Bandai Namco, get an animation studio like Studio Fortiche and make a Tekken show, that could be a step in the right direction, who knows.",1,1738152802.0,Tekken,0,1.0,False

He calls me immediately after, and I think “oh sweet, he’s talking to me now because he was running late,” but it was to tell me how awful of a day he’s having, and if I’m mad at him now… and he instructed me to cancel our gym membership right then and there. I said “I just need some love, I’m scared,” and he said he was too stressed out. He also started getting angry and repeated aggressively several times “I can’t do it. I can’t come back. I won’t do it,” but I didn’t want a hug I just wanted calm, loving reassurance….

Is being late for work and stressed out a fair excuse not to validate someone? I don’t want to treat him unfairly, but I feel confused and heartbroken. Essentially, I woke up in a panic attack, and he never asked what happened or if I was okay, and getting any kind of affection or affirmation was like pulling teeth.

1ics3h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1ics3h9/eulogy_for_my_dad_feedback/,Eulogy for my Dad feedback,"Hi, I'm lucky that I've managed to reach my mid 20s without having to write a eulogy but my Dad died on the 14th and I am writing a eulogy for him that will be read at his funeral. I have written a first draft I will share with the family but before I do I was wondering if anyone had any advice. I have removed personal information so it might read weird when it comes to names and specifics but that's just to respect people's privacy.

On the 14th of January 2025, my Dad died. He went peacefully in his sleep next to the wife he loved and in the warm family home he adored. While the grief is overwhelming, I take some small comfort in knowing that he left this world in his favourite place on earth, beside his favourite person.

The events of that day blur in my mind. I struggle to remember the specifics, but certain moments stand out with painful clarity. I remember the phone call from my brother, his voice shaking as he told me that Dad had suffered a heart attack and didn’t pull through. I remember the walk to work to collect my laptop, the panicky exchange as I bought a coffee from Greggs while I waited for the train north. I remember arriving to find my Mum and brother, both in desperate need of a hug. As was I. But above all, I remember the sudden, visceral transformation within me. On the 13th of January, I was an independent man, standing on my own two feet. Since the 14th, I have felt like a frightened little boy, lost in a new, cruel, cold, and unfamiliar world.

In those first moments of loss, I felt completely alone. It seemed as though I had been forgotten, left adrift without an anchor. I was a frightened little boy, and if there’s one thing a frightened little boy wants, it’s their Dad. Yet, while my Dad was dead, he wasn’t truly absent. His presence lingers in the choices he made, in the love he shared, and in the family he built.

When my Dad went to university, he met the love of his life. Despite wearing a Sherlock Holmes dressing gown when they first met, my Mum still agreed to date him, and eventually, she married him. Perhaps it was a testament to his undeniable charm, or perhaps it’s proof that my Mum could have been a bit pickier in her dating choices. But that single choice, to build a life with my Mum, enshrined a perennial support network that would hold strong through the years. My Mum, a steadfast and unwavering force, embodies all the warmth, kindness, and resilience my Dad cherished. She will be there for anyone who needs her, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Together, they nurtured each other’s best qualities and became the most wonderful parents a child could ever ask for.

In 1991, our family grew when my parents welcomed my sister, into the world. She inherited my Dad’s leadership and tenacity. While my brothers and I might dither and waste time, she ensures that everything and everyone is taken care of. No detail is too small and no person will ever be left behind. During this most difficult time, she has been our constant, ensuring the best arrangements were made for both my Mum and Dad. I don’t know what we would have done without her.

A couple of years later, my eldest brother, came along. He shares my Dad’s wit, warmth, and academic brilliance, effortlessly moving between silly jokes and complex scientific concepts. People keep telling me they’re sorry that my Dad is gone, but when I hear my brother crack an inappropriate joke that makes my Mum laugh, I can’t help but think they’re mistaken. My Dad might be dead, but his humour lives on through his son. As long as those jokes keep coming, my Dad is never truly gone.

Finally, in 1996 my next brother was born. While my sister inherited my Dad’s leadership and eldest brother his humour, William embodies my Dad’s love of sports, films, and his ability to do the right thing whilst seeking no reward or appreciation. He is best summarised by Wordsworth who when speaking about the virtues of men said, “on that best portion of a good man’s life. His little, nameless, unremembered acts. Of kindness and of love.” My brother will help those with a silent dignity, knowing that he is doing so not for personal gain or applause but because it is simply the right thing to do. My brother dropped everything to care for my Mum, and I know he would do the same for anyone in our family.

None of this is to say my Dad was perfect. When it came to dancing, he was less Fred Astaire and more Fred Flintstone; and on the tennis court, he pulled more muscles than he won matches. These are just a few traits that I personally inherited from him. To be honest, I’ve always felt that Dad and I were very different. He was academic, with a sharp, quick wit, while I was decidedly not, possessing a much slower, duller wit. That’s why I was so happy when we found common ground in our shared love of classic cinema and horror films. Dracula, Frankenstein, and Rick Blaine being the solvent for any coarse moments we shared. The last pint I ever had with Dad was in a Wetherspoons, where we made plans to watch all the classic Universal horror and Hammer films. That plan will never happen now, but it’s those small moments where Dad truly shone.

It's easy to be present for the big moments, buying flowers on Valentine's Day, playing with your kids on their birthdays, calling your siblings at Christmas, or toasting Auld Lang Syne over Hogmanay. The real challenge is in the days in between, checking in on loved ones just because you care. A surprise bouquet on a random Wednesday, a phone call out of the blue on a drizzly Monday just to see how you’re doing. Those are the moments where true love lives, and those are the moments I miss most about Dad. He didn’t need a special occasion to show his love for his family.

That said, I’d be lying if I said I don’t think about the big moments too, especially the ones that will never happen. Dad will never walk his daughter down the aisle or lift a beautiful, bouncing grandchild above his head. But I take comfort in knowing that through his life, he showed us all what an exceptional parent and spouse looks like. He consoled us when we failed, celebrated with us when we succeeded, encouraged us when we doubted ourselves, and challenged us when we pushed his patience, something I did more than my fair share of. Yet no matter what, Dad responded with unconditional love and guidance. He was a great teacher, and we are all better for being his children. I know Dad would have loved to be promoted to Granddad, but in his absence, I find solace in knowing that he raised four children who are uniquely capable of parenting. After all, we learned from the best.

My family, and the way they each carry a part of my Dad within them, is why I grieve but do not despair. Death may have robbed me of future dinners, pints, and conversations with my Dad, but it cannot take away the memories we built together. It cannot strip me of my hope, and it cannot erase his legacy. My Dad is dead, but he is not gone.

Each story we tell, each moment we remember, and each lesson we carry forward ensures that he is with us. He taught us kindness, resilience, and above all, the importance of family. He will always be a part of our family, our lives, and our hearts. I love you Dad, thank you for everything and here’s looking at you kid.

I am only looking for a serious relationship and cannot do casual. His profile didn't say what kind of relationship he is looking for, so I asked him. Below is how our conversation went. Does it seem emotionally safe, or should I be worried that he won't be really looking for something serious? His answer was a little hard to decipher.

Him:
I mean I think it would be great to meet someone I’d want to start a relationship with. I’ve just met some people through the app that I’ve become friends with and people who are here like semi short term for like a year or whatever and they’ve wanted something different: like more than casual, less than serious. So I just kind of meet people I think might be interesting and see how it goes. 🤷🏼‍♂️

So yeah, while finding a long term relationship is the ideal outcome, I’m sure you understand that socializing in [country] for expats not always easy and so I guess I didn’t pick anything to keep the door cracked open to allow for friendships and so on that might otherwise not be possible when you’re explicit or too set on your expectations. Does that make sense?

Me:
I'm not sure. Just to be clear, I am dating with the intention of finding a long-term partner. Obviously, it has to evolve naturally, and I wouldn’t rush into anything, but if there’s anything more than friendship, I’d be hoping it leads to a serious relationship. I can't do casual romantic relationships.

Him:

I will be in Delhi in March and have decided to take a break in Udaipur for the Holi weekend. I'll be travelling alone so will be hoping to meet up with some Rajasthani Redditors to celebrate Holi with, hopefully, some drinks and partying.

I'm a guy from Australia and work in Melbourne, and sometimes in Delhi and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I've been working in IT for the last \~ 25 years (!) but prior to that I worked as an arborist and ecologist in Australia. I've travelled extensively, particularly on The Subcontinent. I'm pretty knowledgeable about India, love it, and consider it my second home.

By now you've done the maths and worked out that I'm in my early 50's. But I'm fit and young at heart and keen to meet some like minded Udaipurians (is that the term??) over the Holi weekend. I haven't been to Udaipur in almost 30 years. Then I was lucky enough to stay at the Lake Palace but expect it's much more costly now so will be staying in an old Haveli converted to a nice looking hotel.

My DMs are open if you might be keen to catch up for a coffee or a drink and a chat. Or else any tips on  bars or clubs I might enjoy would be most welcome too. I'm not a needy person and am happy with my own company but it would be fun to get into the Holi festivities with a few locals for a bit of fun and cultural exchange.

So im 33 MTF and been out for a cuple of year now. Previous to coming out to my family one of my cousins come out as FTM so on my mom's side at least people where sort of prepared for me, so i started to talk a lot about him and trans struggles in general with my dad's family so as to ease them into it in a sense. 
Needless to say, my dad wasn't very receptive. He'd tell me things like ""why would SHE do that to HER body?"" Or ""whats the point of dating a GUY? (referring to my cousin's gf) SHE could've stayed the same and date normally"" and my personal favorite ""why do you complicate MY life like this?""
So... i wasn't very excited to come out myself.

My firs clue should've been that when i did come out, he told me ""ill always love you, i don't care what you look like or what you call yourself. You'll always be my son"" but i choose to take at face value and belive my dad supported me... i was wrong. 
Over the last few years I've heard ""Please don't dress like Aiko when we meet, please dress as [deadname]"", ""[deadname] you'll always be my son""

Recently i went on a cuple of dates with a trans girl i met online and made the mistake of telling him. He got OFFENDED when i asked him to not misgender people, not even because of the person in question, but because it hurts me. All because he said ""Did you not like them because you like normal girls or because you know HE is a GUY?"" To which i answered ""1. Idk, i wanted to see if there was something there, but i think i just like cis women and 2. SHE'S NOT A GUY!!""

The last straw was today. Ive been to the corner shop a cuple of times in buggy clothes and once even with with a 5 o'clock shadow and every time the guy calls me miss. But ok, i think, he knows me, he knows im trans. Today i was again in buggy clothes and a bit of a shadow, taking a walk. i felt too masculine. I stoped to buy some coffee from a street vendor and the 70yo man called me miss...

WHY CAN'T MY DAD JUST BE A FUCKING HUMAN BEING? I'm not even asking him to actually feel it or like it, im just asking him to have the basic human decency to call me by my name and gender me correctly like so many STANGERS already do!
And some people in my life tell me ""but the stranger don't have the emotional baggage your dad has about you"" And to those people i say ""yes, but do you know who does have it and still treats me with basic human respect and has even offered to take care of me during the post op of bottom surgery?

So here is how it goes.

Day before:

I was woke just after midnight since there was no particular schedule that i followed in the last days. So, i decided to rawdog it, which ultimately was on the cards. My plan was to stay awake the whole and then sleep for the scientific reason of physiology. To my unpleasant surprise, that did not happen. Did not fall asleep till 12 and when I did, I woke up after 4 hours. Looking back, I should have taken Zolpidem.

What i did in those 24 hours? Went out with friends, had a nice chat which was more of a debate, ate good, and listened to heart sounds.

Exam day: 

All i had on my mind was the unnerving thought of low energy throughout the exam. Took coffee and other nicotine stuff with me. Lifesaver it was. Adrenaline was on a high and everything was blurry (pun intended). You have to rely on the reflexes that you built throughout your preparation. There is not much time to 'stand and stare'.

Coffee, the beloved elixir of mornings and midday pick-me-ups, holds a special place in the hearts of millions around the globe.

Beyond its rich aroma and comforting warmth, coffee owes much of its popularity to one key ingredient: caffeine.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine)

As the world’s most consumed psychoactive substance, caffeine provides the energy boost that fuels our busy lives and sharpens our focus.

But not all coffees are created equal when it comes to caffeine content. From the bold and robust to the delicate and nuanced, coffee varieties vary widely in their caffeine concentrations, leaving many to wonder: which coffee has the most caffeine?

In this exploration of the caffeinated world of coffee, we delve into the factors that influence caffeine levels.

 I also uncover the champions of caffeine content and guide you through the labyrinth of coffee choices to find the brew that delivers the ultimate jolt of energy.

So grab your favorite mug and join us on a journey to discover which coffee reigns supreme in the realm of caffeine.

# What is Caffeine?

Have you ever wondered what makes some drinks extra exciting? It’s caffeine! Caffeine is like a superpower found in things like coffee, tea, and soda.

When we drink something with caffeine, it’s like a friendly wake-up call for our bodies. It helps us feel more alert and awake, which is perfect for starting our day or staying focused on fun activities.

You can find caffeine in lots of tasty treats, like chocolate, energy drinks, and even some types of ice cream! But remember, while a little caffeine can be fun, it’s essential to enjoy it wisely. Too much caffeine might make us feel jittery or have trouble sleeping.

So, next time you enjoy a delicious drink with caffeine, remember to sip slowly and listen to your body. Caffeine can be a fun way to add some pep to your step, but it’s always best in moderation!

# Understanding Caffeine Content in Coffee

Have you ever wondered what makes coffee give grown-ups such a boost? Well, it’s all about something called caffeine! Let’s dive into the world of coffee and learn about this magical ingredient together.

# What is Caffeine?

Caffeine is like a little superhero found in coffee. It’s what gives people that extra pep in their step after they’ve had their morning brew. It’s like a tiny alarm clock for your body and brain!

# How Does Caffeine Get in Coffee?

Caffeine is naturally hiding inside coffee beans. When those beans get roasted and mixed with hot water, the caffeine jumps out and joins the party! That’s why when you drink coffee, you’re also getting a dose of caffeine.

# How Coffee is Made Affects Caffeine Too?

How the coffee is made can also change how much caffeine ends up in your cup. If the coffee is brewed for a long time or has lots of coffee grounds, it’ll have more caffeine. That’s why some coffees taste super strong – they’re packed with caffeine!

# Enjoying Coffee Safely

While caffeine can be super helpful for grown-ups, it’s essential to be careful, especially for kids.

Too much caffeine can make you feel jumpy or make it hard to sleep. So, it’s best to stick to drinks like milk, water, or juice most of the time.

# Impact of Caffeine on Your Health

Have you ever wondered what caffeine does to your body? Let’s dive into the exciting world of caffeine and its effects on your health in a super easy way!

# Boosts Your Energy

Caffeine is like a little alarm clock for your brain! It helps wake you up and feel more alert. That’s why many people enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning to kickstart their day.

# Improves Concentration

Need to focus on your homework or a fun project? Caffeine can help with that too! It helps sharpen your mind and keep you on task, making it easier to concentrate.

# Enhances Physical Performance

If you love sports or playing outside, caffeine might become your new best friend! It can give you a burst of energy and make your muscles feel stronger, helping you run faster or jump higher.

# Can Disrupt Sleep

Uh-oh, here comes the tricky part. While caffeine can help you feel awake and alert during the day, having too much of it, especially in the afternoon or evening—can mess with your sleep. That’s why it’s a good idea to avoid caffeine before bedtime.

# May Cause Jitters or Nervousness

Sometimes, if you have too much caffeine, it can make you feel jittery or nervous, kind of like having butterflies in your stomach. It’s important to listen to your body and enjoy caffeine in moderation.

# Can Affect Your Heart

Caffeine can make your heart beat a little faster, especially if you have a lot of it or if you’re sensitive to it.

While this is usually okay for most people, it’s essential to be mindful of how caffeine makes you feel and talk to your grown-ups if you have any concerns.

# Types of Coffee Beans

Coffee beans come in various types, each offering unique flavors, aromas, and characteristics that cater to different preferences. Here are some of the most common types of coffee beans:

**Arabica**

Known for their smooth and flavorful profile, Arabica beans are the most popular type of coffee beans worldwide.

They often exhibit sweet, fruity, and acidic notes, making them a favorite among coffee connoisseurs.

**Robusta**

Robusta beans are prized for their bold and strong flavors, higher caffeine content, and earthy or woody undertones. They are commonly used in espresso blends for their crema and intensity.

**Liberica**

This type of coffee bean is less common but is known for its distinctive and unique flavor profile, often described as bold, smoky, and woody.

Liberica beans are popular in some regions of the world for their unconventional taste.

**Excelsa**

Excelsa beans offer a tart and fruity flavor with a hint of spiciness. They are often used to add complexity to coffee blends, providing a different dimension of flavor.

**Blue Mountain**

Considered one of the highest quality and most sought-after coffee beans, Blue Mountain beans from Jamaica are known for their mild flavor, balanced acidity, and smooth body.

**Geisha**

Geisha beans, originally from Ethiopia. They have gained popularity for their floral and tea-like characteristics, along with a complex and nuanced flavor profile.

**Bourbon**

Bourbon coffee beans, often grown in Central and South America, are esteemed for their sweetness, bright acidity, and rich flavors.

Each type of coffee bean offers a distinctive experience, allowing coffee enthusiasts to explore a wide range of flavors and aromas to find their perfect cup of coffee.

# Brewing Methods and Caffeine Extraction

Imagine making a yummy cup of coffee is like doing a fun experiment! There are special ways to make coffee called brewing methods. Here are a few ways people make coffee:

1. **Drip Coffee:** It’s like magic! Hot water drips through coffee grounds and collects the tasty coffee at the bottom.
2. **French Press:** It’s like using a big, fancy cup! You mix hot water with coffee grounds and press them together. Then, you separate the grounds from the coffee to drink.
3. **Espresso:** This is a strong cup of coffee! Hot water is pushed through coffee grounds at high pressure to make a powerful and rich coffee shot.
4. [**Cold Brew**](https://gomehedi.com/the-best-coffee-for-cold-brew/)**:** It’s like making coffee in slow motion! Coffee grounds soak in cold water for many hours to make a smooth and refreshing drink.

Each brewing method makes coffee taste a little different, so you can try them all and see which one you like best! Isn’t making coffee fun?

# Tips for Choosing High-Caffeine Coffee

Sure! Here are some tips for choosing high-caffeine coffee:

1. **Look for Robusta Beans**: Robusta coffee beans typically contain more caffeine than Arabica beans. So choosing a coffee blend that includes Robusta beans can result in a higher caffeine content.
2. **Check the Roast Level**: Lighter roasts tend to retain more caffeine than darker roasts because the beans are roasted for a shorter time. If you’re looking for a high-caffeine coffee, opt for a light or medium roast.
3. **Consider Single-Origin Coffees**: Some single-origin coffees, such as those from Ethiopia or Kenya, naturally have higher caffeine levels compared to blends. Explore different origins to find a coffee with a robust caffeine kick.
4. **Cold Brew Concentrate**: Making cold brew coffee concentrate by steeping coarsely ground coffee beans in water for an extended period results in a concentrated caffeine content. Dilute the concentrate with water or milk to adjust the caffeine level to your preference.
5. **Read Reviews**: Check customer reviews and recommendations for high-caffeine coffee brands or specific blends. Others experiences can help guide you toward coffee options that pack a caffeine punch.
6. **Experiment with Different Brewing Methods**: Certain brewing methods, such as espresso or French press, can extract more caffeine from the coffee grounds. Explore various brewing techniques to find the method that yields the highest caffeine content.
7. **Enjoy Responsibly**: While high-caffeine coffee can provide an energy boost, it’s essential to consume it in moderation. Pay attention to your body’s response to caffeine and adjust your intake accordingly.

# Popular High-Caffeine Coffee Brands

Are you ready to discover some coffee brands that will give you an extra kick of energy? Check out these popular options for high-caffeine coffee:

I washed all of my sheets and deep-cleaned my house. I made a list of all the products I’ve used recently, as well as the foods I’ve eaten. All of my products are ones I’ve had for the past six months or so. I did try some new foods, including red bean lentils and coffee imported from Colombia. I have not changed my laundry detergent since the summer, and I always wash new clothes before wearing them.

Eventually, the reaction spread to my calves, the top of my butt crack, and my butt cheeks. I took an Epsom salts bath, which seemed to help, and switched to a fragrance-free body wash. Previously, I had been using Aveeno Sensitive Skin, which I thought might be the cause. However, the reaction only occurred on my lower body. As it spread, the little bumps became almost white as they became less irritated.

I did not experience any reaction on my upper chest, back, or throat areas. I have no known food allergies, just the typical environmental ones. I visited the doctor, who prescribed steroids and a cream. My reaction seemed to worsen when I used Cetaphil body wash and Sarna, which might have been triggered by the shea butter. When the reaction affected my butt crack, I stayed home, experiencing an itching sensation and noticing little bumps in that area.

I have completed my round of steroids and continued to use the Cetaphil body wash. My reaction has improved, and I feel much better now.

I am scheduled for allergy testing tomorrow and would like to know if I need to request any additional tests. I believe that patch testing could help identify the specific allergens I am sensitive to. Please let me know if there's anything else I should ask. My allergies tend to bother me at night and in the morning, and I would say my skin isn't very sensitive. If it were, I would expect an instant reaction.

1icri1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1icri1h/he_tried_to_cheat_on_me/,He “tried” to cheat on me,"He “tried” to cheat, I got angry and the focus is now on my reaction (not taking any accountability for his “attempt” at cheating)?

So my boyfriend (M, 30) and I (M, 25) have recently separated. A few weeks ago, he Snapchatted me while he was at work and they came through on a 3 sec timer. I asked him why and he said that his phone overheated/glitched so maybe it was that - when I challenged him on this, he told me that he would never lie to me again (will get to that) because he knows how much he hurt me. I sat up until close to 3am waiting for him to get home because he suggested we get food together. He got home, we didn’t get food, went to bed and he was all over me. Then he came clean…apparently earlier that morning (while I was on a zoom call with my therapist in the next room), he decided to take a photo of his ass to send to some straight guy he’s been pining over for years. He says that he didn’t send it, but I don’t believe him. We stayed up for hours arguing, crying and going through every emotion possible. 

The next day, he dropped me at my friends house for a party - on the drive there he was holding my hand, telling me he loved me and to message if I need a lift home. Later in the night, I said I thought I would stay with my friends…he said all was good and he was going to go and stay with his family. He then wouldn’t answer my calls or texts, when I got home, I found that he’d already packed a bag and laptop (so had organised it all before he even went to work). I was quite drunk (not an excuse), but I told him how selfish, inconsiderate and avoidant he is. When he eventually picked up, I roared at him on the phone and said I would come to him (which I know was bad). He was incredibly dismissive (and I’ve since found out that his sister was sitting next to him, recording and also telling him what to say).

I ordered myself some food to soak up the alcohol and amongst the chaos, forgot my keys. So I continued to try and call him and get let it - He eventually turned off his phone and ignored my calls + texts…so I sat on the pavement from 3am in the morning until about 8am when his family brought his set of keys over and let me in. He then proceeded to give me the run around for days (told me he was coming home, then he wasn’t, then after Christmas). So I broke up with him - every time we have discussed it, he has made it entirely about my reaction to the news and taken zero accountability for his actions. 

Previously, he’s lied about multiple things involving his ex - four months into our relationship I had to ask him to unfollow the ex’s alt twitter + ask him to stop sending nudes. He’s also lied about the ex contacting him and about an item he picked up for me when we were dating (but gave to the ex and lied about multiple times over the course of 14 months). 

He never deleted his dating profiles (only the apps) and we’ve had multiple discussions about sex/pornography. He outed me as trans to his friends at a wedding we went to (called me over to tell his friend what scar cream I used and show my scars - and when I asked for space afterwards because I was upset, he and his sister continued to follow me). 

Despite all of these things, I still blame myself. If I hadn’t of gotten angry, if I had’ve gone for a walk instead of trying to solve things then and there. Maybe I was being unrealistic or asking for too much? I thought by cooking, cleaning, washing all of his clothes, adjusting my schedule to come to his gigs and doing more things he liked it would fix things - clearly not.

I’ve spent the last week and a half beating on myself about how this relationship falling apart has been my fault and how much I just want him back. Because he can be incredibly kind, sweet, caring, thoughtful and loving - it was only when I lost my job about six months ago we started to fight more (he has said that my loss of employment/arguing with insurance agencies and Centrelink has caused him stress…and that’s part of why he did what he did). 

He came over a few weeks ago and we slept together, he told me he loves me and how he’s missed me. How some of his clothes still smell like me and how he’s jerked off to the thought of us - I have no idea what is going on, what is coming next and what to make of everything that is going on/has already happened. I don’t know how to move forward when I’m still in love with this man (as I understand the why behind his actions is largely linked to unhealed trauma). It breaks my heart, because he has hurt me so bad (but I know that’s only because he has a lot of unhealed hurt himself). 

I’ve also found out that he was using the app for a toy we bought together to sext other people… 

Most recently, he tried telling me how low he has been feeling and how he was contemplating suicide and ended up self harming. I’ve cut all contact, unfriended and unfollowed him on everything - we were meant to meet for coffee, but when I confronted him about some of his shitty behaviour, he came up with some bullshit excuse about how his parents needed help with their kitchen renovations because “there were bricks where there weren’t meant to be bricks”. Lol, okay avoidant. 

I feel absolutely horrible for cutting him off, I’m so saddened by the idea of never speaking to him again and am worried about the next time I see him out. I’m also really scared that he’s going to end up taking his life or seriously hurting himself - I don’t want him to not be on this earth anymore 😔

The Importance of Functionality in Kitchen Decor Choices
--------------------------------------------------------

When designing your kitchen, it’s easy to get swept up in the allure of beautiful designs and trendy decor. However, one crucial aspect often gets overlooked: functionality. Practicality in kitchen decor choices ensures that your space is not only visually appealing but also serves your daily needs.

You might prioritize aesthetics, but the reality is that a well-decorated kitchen should make your culinary experiences smoother and more enjoyable. Here's why focusing on functionality is essential.

The kitchen is the heart of the home, where meals are prepared and memories are made. Choosing decor that enhances your cooking experience can significantly improve your time spent in the kitchen.

- **Smart Space Utilization:** Consider adjustable shelves and multifunctional furniture. These can help you maximize your storage space while keeping everything within reach.
- **Ergonomic Layout:** Ensure that essential items are easily accessible. For example, placing pots and pans near the stove and utensils within arm's reach avoids unnecessary movement.
- **Quality Cooking Tools:** Instead of focusing solely on looks, invest in tools designed for efficiency and durability. Well-made knives, cutting boards, and pots not only perform better but also last longer.

### Creating a Safe Environment

Safety is a critical concern in any kitchen. decor that prioritizes safety translates to peace of mind for you and your family.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-goods-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Non-Slip Rugs:** If you like to add some style to your flooring, consider non-slip mats. They provide traction, reducing the risk of slips and falls.
- **Proper Lighting:** Use various lighting options in your kitchen. Bright, task-oriented lighting ensures you can see your work area clearly, preventing accidents or mishandling of sharp tools.
- **Clear Pathways:** Avoid clutter. Items should be stored efficiently to maintain clear pathways, making it easier for you to move around while cooking.

A disorganized kitchen is often frustrating and uninviting. Increasing functionality can help you maintain a tidy space, making meal prep more efficient.

- **Designate Specific Zones:** Create areas for cooking, prepping, and cleaning. This organization streamlines your workflow and helps you stay focused.
- **Creative Storage Solutions:** Use storage solutions like hanging racks for pots and pans or drawer dividers for utensils. These options keep essentials organized and easy to find.
- **Labels and Containers:** Clear containers and labels can simplify ingredient storage. You’ll always know what you have and where it is, which saves time during meal prep.

### Customizing to Your Needs

Your kitchen decor choices should reflect your personal style while catering to your cooking habits. Think about how you use your kitchen daily, then choose decor that aligns with those needs.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-goods-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Assess Your Cooking Style:** Are you a casual cook or a gourmet chef? Tailor your decor and tools to fit your culinary needs and preferences.
- **Incorporate Personal Touches:** Add decorative accents that resonate with you, whether it's art that inspires you or a color palette that evokes warmth and comfort.

Today, I stumbled across an unfinished piece of an article I wrote years ago. I decided to complete it 4 years later (with a complete different mindset). The result? A nice plot twist at the end that's worth reading. (Apologies for the length.)

**Warning: Language ahead.**

**This is a long read, but it's worth sticking with until the end.** *If it’s easier, feel free to skim over the life lessons if you want.*

*17.07.2021*  
**6 Life Lessons I Learned the First Time I Went Skydiving**

Two years ago, my boyfriend gifted me what turned out to be both the worst and best gift of my life: a skydiving session. It was my 27th birthday, and we were celebrating with a trip to Krakow (Poland). After dinner, he handed me what looked like a letter and said, ""It wasn’t easy to get the timing right, but I managed! Happy birthday, Alex.""

Curious, I opened the envelope to find a certificate for a tandem skydiving session - scheduled for the day after tomorrow. Timing, indeed.

I had always dreamed of skydiving - in the same way you dream of swimming with sharks or climbing Mount Everest- things you romanticize but never actually expect to do. Now, I had no time to chicken out or overthink it. Ready or not, I was jumping out of a plane.

What I thought would be a nightmare turned out to be one of the most transformative experiences of my life. Here are six life lessons I learned on that unforgettable day:

1. **Stress Isn’t the Enemy**  You can’t “manage” stress or wish it away, no matter how many people tell you to ""just relax."" Stress is inevitable - especially when you’re about to fall 4 km (2.5 miles) from the sky. But here’s the thing: stress is a part of being alive. Instead of fighting it, I decided to embrace it. That flutter in my stomach? That was excitement. My racing heart? Proof I was doing something extraordinary. Skydiving taught me that stress is just another emotion, and it’s not about controlling it - it’s about learning to coexist with it.
2. **We’re Wired to Worry** The moment I saw the certificate, my mind spiraled into a ""what if"" frenzy. What if the parachute didn’t open? What if the instructor made a mistake? I’d barely processed how thoughtful my boyfriend’s gift was before jumping to all the ways it could go wrong. And, of course, the instructor only spoke Polish - because, why not add “language barrier” to the list of potential problems? At one point, I swear I heard him yell “Kurva!” as I was about to jump, and I’m pretty sure it wasn’t a good sign. It’s human nature to anticipate the worst, but those fears often rob us of the joy of the moment. In hindsight, all those ""what ifs"" were baseless. Now, I try to approach new experiences with curiosity instead of dread - well, most of the time.
3. **Sometimes You Just Need to Have Faith** Faith has become such a taboo word these days, but just like stress, we need it to survive. Whether it’s faith in your God, the parachute, or even something as small as yourself, faith keeps you grounded - or in this case, helps you soar. Taking that leap from the plane required me to put my trust in something beyond my control. And that’s okay. Sometimes, it’s not about having all the answers. It’s about taking the leap and trusting you’ll land on your feet.
4. **You Are Your Best Ally (and Worst Enemy)** Nobody knows your fears and dreams better than you do. Skydiving was something I had secretly wanted to do for years but never admitted, even to myself. And yet, when the opportunity came, my inner critic was the loudest voice: “You can’t do this. You’ll mess it up.” But once I took that leap (literally), I realized I was my own biggest hurdle. The mind can be a battlefield, but it can also be your greatest ally. Learn to cheer yourself on -sometimes, it’s all you need to take the leap.
5. **Adrenaline Is Addictive** I had never felt anything like the rush of freefalling. It’s not just thrilling -it’s clarifying. In those few seconds of descent, I wasn’t thinking about work, bills, or petty worries. I was entirely present, fully alive. Since then, I’ve started chasing that feeling in less extreme ways: trying new things, stepping out of my comfort zone, and savoring moments that make my heart race. Adrenaline isn’t just for daredevils; it’s for anyone who wants to feel alive.
6. **First Times Are Sacred** There’s only one ""first time"" for everything. Skydiving taught me the value of that unique, unrepeatable moment when you do something for the first time. It’s exhilarating, terrifying, and beautiful all at once. It reminded me to treasure every ""first"" - whether it’s a big adventure or a small step outside your routine. Because once you’ve done it, the magic of the unknown is gone. Savor it while it lasts.

**The Landing**  
When my feet finally touched the ground, I was overwhelmed with gratitude - for the experience, for my boyfriend’s boldness in gifting it, and for the chance to surprise myself. Skydiving wasn’t just an adrenaline rush; it was a life lesson in disguise.

Would I do it again? Absolutely.

*29.01.2025*  
**FUCKING. NOT.**

Don’t get me wrong - skydiving was the best experience I’ve ever had. But stumbling across this piece from 2021 Alex? That was the real freefall. Reading this self-righteous manifesto felt like watching someone trip confidently into an open manhole.

Sweet, sweet 2021 Alex - you dreamy little overachiever with a Pinterest board for a brain - you had no idea what was coming.

“Stress isn’t the enemy,” you said? Well, guess what, babe? Stress is the enemy, and it’s winning the war. Coexisting with stress? Please. These days, I wouldn’t coexist with stress if you paid me in $TRUMP coins (yes, because that’s a thing now) and a lifetime pass to the Netflix password-sharing amnesty program (yeah, cause that's another thing now).

And “curiosity instead of dread”? Oh, honey. Let’s talk about trying to feel adventurous while doomscrolling through the latest updates on Gaza, Ukraine, and Congo (another one?!). The last time I felt curious was when I wondered if that hot guy from Squid Game would come back for season 2. Spoiler: OH, he does! - O*h but you haven’t even watched Squid Game yet, poor you.*

The real kicker is that this piece makes you sound like some kind of zen adrenaline junkie. Adrenaline? Addictive? Darling, 2025 Alex swapped that rush for weighted blankets, a shared puff of Jess’s joint (because we’re broke), and a Netflix queue longer than her to-do list.

Thrills? No thanks. These days, my heart only races when I accidentally buy the wrong coffee at the store (it’s lungo, not americano, damn it).

And this whole ""first times are sacred"" spiel? Adorable. But let’s be real: the only “first” I treasure now is the sacred ritual of watching a new episode of Severance for the first (out of many) times. - *Oh? You haven’t watched Severance yet either? (Okay, now I’m just jealous.)*

So, while 2021 Alex was busy preaching BS about embracing chaos and living boldly, 2025 Alex is here to say: you were full of shit. The skydiving part? Sure, best day of my life. The rest? A hippie fever dream that aged worse than a pandemic hair dye job. But hey, at least we’ve learned to laugh at ourselves.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a blanket with my name on it - and Jess just finished rolling.

2. **Blot, Don’t Rub** – Use a clean cloth or paper towel to blot up as much of the stain as possible. Rubbing can spread it.
3. **Test a Cleaning Solution** – Before applying any cleaner, test it on a hidden part of the rug to ensure it doesn’t damage the fibers or cause discoloration.
4. **Apply the Solution** – Use a gentle cleaning solution, let it sit for a few minutes, and blot it up.
5. **Rinse and Dry** – Use a damp cloth to remove any residue, then blot dry with a clean towel. Allow the rug to air dry completely.

**▮ Stain-Specific Solutions**

* **Food & Beverage Stains (Wine, Coffee, Juice, etc.)**
   * Mix **one tablespoon of dish soap, one tablespoon of white vinegar, and two cups of warm water**.
   * Blot with a clean cloth.
   * Rinse with cold water and dry.
* **Pet Stains (Urine, Vomit, Feces)**
   * Blot up as much as possible.
   * Use a **mix of equal parts white vinegar and water** to neutralize odors.
   * Sprinkle **baking soda** over the area after cleaning to absorb odors.
   * Vacuum once dry.
* **Grease & Oil Stains**
   * Sprinkle **baking soda or cornstarch** on the stain and let it sit for 15 minutes.
   * Vacuum up the powder.
   * Dab with dish soap and warm water.
* **Ink Stains**
   * Use **rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball** to blot the stain.
   * Avoid rubbing to prevent spreading.
* **Mud & Dirt**
   * Let it dry completely, then vacuum.
   * Use a mild detergent and water to clean any residue.
* **Blood Stains**
   * Use **cold water and dish soap** (hot water can set the stain).
   * Blot until the stain lifts.

**▮ Extra Tips**

* If the stain is stubborn, use a **carpet cleaner or steam cleaner**.
* For delicate or expensive rugs (wool, silk, Persian), consider professional cleaning.
* Always **avoid bleach**, as it can damage rug fibers.",1,1738148667.0,Bedscape,0,1.0,False

Instead of decided to make this post to share the strategy that worked for me when I was just starting out. I’m in Canada if that matters.

When I was just getting started I met with a government-funded career coach who told me that 80% of jobs are never advertised. After helping me with my resume, he advised me to make a list of 5 companies in the area that I might want to work for. By the way, I put down my student projects, volunteer work, etc. as experience in my resume at this point.

I made a script and started cold-calling. “Good day, my name is lovethebee_bethebee. I am wondering if you are currently hiring any ecologists, and if not, is there someone whom I may send my resume to in case a position opens up in the future?”

Most times I would be told to apply online but I only needed one email of someone in case a position opens up in the future. I send them my resume and ask them for an informational interview to talk about the industry. I only needed one person to say yes. We meet for coffee and talk about the industry and afterwards I ask them if they have any contacts I can send my resume to. I only needed one person to give me a list of contacts. I contact everyone on the list. I only need one person to say yes to an informational interview to talk about the industry.

I keep repeating this process until I get called back by someone in the grapevine for a real interview. I tell them that I actually applied to the job online already. They haven’t even looked at the online applications by the time I get an offer. Most people are going to reject you, but some will be happy to talk to you about the industry because they were where you are once.

Some tips:

Ask lots of questions. People love to talk about themselves.

Be persistent but not aggressive. Respect people’s time.

Roll with the punches. Most of the time you will be ignored or rejected. Just keep on keeping on. Find every opportunity to network. Volunteer while you’re looking if you can afford to.

Getting a job that’s not quite what you want but is in an adjacent field is a great way to get your foot in the door.

I have been reading the disucssions in this community and felt that this is the best palce to ask questions.* 

I have started a D2C brand last year & my primary background is tech. Being a lean team, we had to rely on hacks to market our product, and I realised even after working with hiring agency & partnering with influencers, marketing takes huge chunk of the day. 

And on top of that, most of the tasks are kind-of repeatitive. We had to spend good amount of time looking at what sort of ads competitors are putting up, finding inspiration, if I got the inspiration then making that ad creatives were time taking. 

**I have spoken to \~ 6 folks in marketing (ex. Marketing head of Udaan, ex. director of Unacademy), and these are the points I boiled down to.** 

* Marketing is often relies on Graphic designer & content writers for collaters, so building something which helps them create ads (video or image?) is helpful.
* Competitive analysis and regularly keeping a watch on what other competitors are doing is painful, having a tool which helps in analysis is helpful. 
* Using AI to run A/B tests, give 1-2 day nudges while managing campaigns and effortlessly update changes as per new strategies. 

What I realised that, with AI - the way we use softwares will change. It's risky to automate marketing, but there will be tools which will definately help them 100x their work. 

**I want to understand**

* **What sorts of tool do you daily?** 
* **How relevant are the points which I have written above?**
* **What's the most frustrating part of the problem or challenges you face?** 

I'm going FT into building this, and your thoughts will help me a lot. If you want to do an elabore discussion I would love to catch-up with you over a coffee. (just DM me a high)

*Moderators, please dont delete this, I'm trying to understand the problems, and I'm here with no intentions of selling anything.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
***Edit to my E2 examination***

***Numbers Theory***

*-          The numbers at the bottom of the MDR team’s screens “0x137D58”*

*-          These could be “Memory Addresses”*

*-          In low-level programming languages like C, hexadecimal values often represent memory addresses*

*-           An address such as 0x137D58 could point to a specific location in memory where data or instructions are stored.*

 ***Vending Machine Theory***

*Timestamp 47:31*

*-          The white coils of Row C in the vending machine are in a different position in this frame compared to 47:39 when Dylan looks at Row C specifically*

*-          C2 and C4 are the mirror opposite colours*

*-          This vending machine screen shows a* ***“positive”*** *green monochrome LCD display*

*-          The vending machine in Lumon’s official LinkedIn “Kitchenette Tour” video shows a* ***“negative”*** *blue monochrome LCD display*

*-          Why would they use two different vending machines? This must be intentional*

*Timestamp 47:34*

*-          There are 3 tokens left inside the Jar*

*-          This means that it is at the end of the work day*

*-          If Mark no-showed and Irv only took his first token, this would make sense for timeline continuity* 

*Timestamp 47:40*

*-          Dylan takes 1 vending token and looks at row C*

*-          C1 Edamame (Dry Roasted) (Pear Green/Inside of Pear Green)*

*-          C2 Raisins (Shriveled) (Pastel Pink/Dark Red) (interesting to note ""shriveled"" since that is a given)*

*-          C3 Peanuts (Roasted and Salted) (Dark Teal Blue Green/Light Yellow Green)*

*-          C4 Beets (Dried and Sliced) (Dark Red/Red Orange)*

*-          That row C is in the row 2**^(nd)* *from the top. Not 3**^(rd)* *from the top like a normal machine*

*-          The top row does not look like snacks (different packaging)*

*-          We don’t get to see what the bottom or top row items are*

*Timestamp 47:44*

*-          Dylan is about to press B but stops and re-assess his options*

*Timestamp 47:48*

*-          Dylan looks at row D*

*-          D1 Blueberries (Dried) (Cyan Blue/Dark Blue)*

*-          D2 Ginseng (Cubed) (Darker Blue/Baby Blue)*

*-          D3 Sunflower Seeds (no info)* *(Beige green/Forest Green)*

*-          D4 Meat (Smoked and Salted) (Orange Red/Light Pink)*

*-          The white coils are changed*

*-          It looks like someone has previously ordered one of the D4’s*

*-          I assume that Dylan was the one who tried D4 previously as he warns people to not have it*

*Timestamp 47:51*

*-          Dylan Presses C2*

*-          The Raisin’s Fall Down and Dylan collects them with his right hand*

*-          Notice the Light Pink side of the package is facing away from him*

*Timestamp 48:04*

*-          Dylan is holding the raisins package walking out of the Kitchenette with Helly*

*-          The Red side of the package is now facing away from him*

***Conspiracies:***

*-          Tokens + C2 + Shriveled*

*-          “When antivirus software effectively utilizes tokens for validation, it can help mitigate risks associated with C2 servers. By ensuring that only legitimate commands are executed on a system (through token verification), antivirus solutions can disrupt the communication between malware on infected machines and their respective C2 servers.*

*-          Moreover, as antivirus technologies evolve and become more adept at detecting malicious behaviors associated with C2 communications, the reliance on traditional C2 infrastructures may diminish—leading to what could be described as “C2 shriveling.” This dynamic creates a feedback loop where enhanced security measures lead to reduced effectiveness of malware operations.”*

*-*          ***The Hex Colours at the bottom of the computer monitors have 2 shades of similar colours, just like the vending machine item boxes***

Okay, now to the data dump.

**Ep3**

 

**Timestamp 1:22**

\-          Dylan walks by with a Dark Green/Puke Green snack container

\-          Mark is holding a white Lumon coffee mug, aren’t the mugs usually blue and different shaped handles?

\-          Mark questions “Cobel?” as if he wasn’t familiar with that name

\-          I just noticed that Mark wears his watch on his right hand and is also right-handed  
(I also wear my watch on my dominant hand, so this is probably nothing)

**Timestamp 1:24**

\-          Dylan eats a ***potato chip*** out of his snack container

\-          There aren’t any potato chips that we’ve seen in the vending machine in E1 or E2

\-          There is No snack or item in the vending machine that we’ve seen so far with the exact colour scheme we see here

**Timestamp 4:14**

Petey: It’s like having two different lives suddenly stitched together. But the relativity’s fucked.  
So, my first day at Lumon’s as far back as my fifth birthday. And with two pasts, it blurs the present too.  
But ***they*** said it will get better.

\-          I believe this to be a very important line, it seems like Petey is our true north when it comes to information

\-          It makes sense that Petey uses “they” to describe the female doctor that allegedly is helping him to unsever

\-          Petey doesn’t trust Irving

**Timestamp 9:19**

\-          Mark comes down the stairs to wake up Petey

\-          The Plastic storage container is stacked by the wall

\-          Any scene in the basement after this scene during this episode, I do not believe was during the same day

**Timestamp 11:30**

\-          Mark leaves for work and he doesn’t have his recycling at the curb

\-          When Ricken drops by to leave his book at Mark’s door, the recycling is at the curb

\-          2 different days are seen in this episode (at least 2)

**Timestamp 11:47**

\-          Mark’s work locker drawer

\-          The work watch is finally ticking. Does this mean time is finally moving forwards?

\-          We can see Mark’s signature on his driver’s license is much different than his work ID

\-          The signature seems to be less elegant and professional, perhaps more childish

\-          The money clip is on the opposite side

\-          The blue key card looks more worn down and the metal clip is facing away

\-          The car keys seem different

\-          It doesn’t show Mark taking his watch to wear it

\-          The locker doesn’t look as scratched up as it did in Ep1

\-          The lighting overhead also looks quite different

**Timestamp 13:52**

\-          Dylan asks why Mark is standing funny

\-          This could suggest that something has changed with Mark since they lost saw him

**Timestamp 17:00**

\-          Petey is drawing a map in the Red and Blue bathrobe

\-          But when Mark came down to wake Petey up earlier (9:19), Petey was already out of the robe and dressed in a black shirt and zip up sweatshirt

**Timestamp 17:30**

\-          In the flashback with Petey drawing the map at work he has a Dark Green/Light Green snack package on his desk (tall packaging)

\-          This same snack packaging is seen at the very bottom right row of the vending machine

\-          From my research, it seems to be labeled “Peas”

**Timestamp 17:32**

\-          Mark asks Petey what he is drawing and Petey responds “You, getting back to work in cubist form”

\-          “Cubist form is characterized by its fragmentation of subjects into geometric shapes viewed from multiple angles”

\-          Perhaps the map is not designed to escape the severance floor

\-          Perhaps the map is designed to break into and go back inside the floor

**Timestamp 18:22**

\-          Mrs. Selvig walks down into Mark’s basement

\-          There is a missing Plastic storage container that should be stacked against the wall by the stairs (from earlier) which would again suggest a different day

**Timestamp 23:42**

\-          Ms. Cobel walks in at 10:27am into the reception area and hands Milchick Ricken’s book that she found at Mark’s

\-          She says “Ricken, his fifth book”

\-          What if Ricken hasn’t written 5 books, what if he has left the same book at Mark’s 5 different times

\-          Ms. Cobel asks Milchick to check to the book for “messages”

\-          This could suggest that Ricken and the “outside” characters are not what they seem, and they might know more than Mark (and us the viewer) realizes

\-          Could they all be severed people who are sort of actors?

**Timestamp 25:22**

\-          Ms. Cobel throws her coffee mug at Mark and it leaves a mark on the door

\-          It sounds like the mug broke, but you can see it on the floor slightly damaged

**Timestamp 26:00**

\-          Mark asks Ms. Cobel if she wants the door open or closed

\-          She responds with “both” which sort of hints at mirrored realities

**Timestamp 26:24**

\-          Helly writes on a yellow sticky note “I DON’T WANT TO WORK HERE” in call capital letters

\-          Helly seems to always write in capital letters

**Timestamp 30:15**

\-          Ms. Cobel walks into the reception area and we can see Ricken’s book has moved to a new location on the desk

\-          The light green folder is now closed

**Timestamp 30:21**

\-          The black mark that Ms. Cobel’s coffee mug left on her door is missing

\-          The Mug is back on her table, unbroken

\-          The Coatrack is in a different position

\-          Ms. Cobel’s coat is on the bottom hook now

\-          The purse is missing from the coat rack

\-          Natalie has the same colour nail polish as Helly

\-          The Board speaks through Natalie for some reason, which would suggest she is higher up in the ranks than any character we’ve seen so far

\-          Natalie’s headset is on the left side of her face, in a future episode I noticed that it switches to her right side

**Timestamp 33:30**

\-          Helly is joking about a plan to make the O&D department afraid of them, by killing Mark and wearing his face

\-          Helly says “I’m wearing your face, and they’re like, ‘Who’s face is that?’. And I’m like, ‘The last person who fucked with us”.

\-          Perhaps Helly was the last person who “fucked” with Lumon, so Helena took over Helly’s face

\-          Mark says “Just - seems like they would recognize my face. Maybe if you wore it inside out?”

\-          This feels like the writers are being coy and talking right to the viewer here

**Timestamp 34:02**

\-          Perpetuity Wing quotes next to Jame Eagan

“The remembered man does not decay. – Kier Eagan”

“History lives in us, whether we learn it or not. – Jame Eagan

\-          Both quotes are shown next to the same wax figure of Jame Eagan

\-          Perhaps they are the same person

**Timestamp 35:09**

\-          The group is walking down 3 flights of stairs, which means that their work floor is technically not the basement floor

**Timestamp 35:48**

\-          The Four Tempers (from which are derived every human soul”

\-          1. Woe 2. Frolic 3. Dread 4. Malice

\-          The 4 boxes that the MDR fill with the numbers on the screen are represented

**Timestamp 36:01**

\-          A scale is shown with a yellow liquid on the left side and a metal weight on the right side

\-          The amount of yellow liquid weighs more than the metal counterbalance

\-          What is this liquid?

\-          Could this liquid be cerebrospinal fluid?

\-          Cerebrospinal fluid is a highly valuable substance in both clinical and research settings

\-          CSF has gained significant attention in neuroscience research due to its potential as a diagnostic tool for various neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and *Parkinsons* disease.

**Lumon CEO’s:**

1.      CEO 1865-1939  
Kier Eagan  
1841-1939

2.      CEO 1941-1959  
Myrtle Eagan

Phillip “Pip” Eagan  
1937-1999

6.      CEO 1999-2003  
Leonora Eagan  
1955-2005

7.      CEO 2003-Now  
Jame Eagan  
1960s-Now  


\-          Random Thought: Could Phillip “Pip” Eagan be Marcian “Ted” Hoff who was a real person born in 1937

**Timestamp 36:52**

\-          iHelly crosses out “Lumon will save the world” on her Bingo card

\-          This suggests that Lumon is not the “good guy” and may be the cause of the end of the world instead

\-          There is a 2 year gap between Kier Eagan and Myrtle Eagan, all the other CEO’s started immediately after the previous ended

**Timestamp 36:60**

\-          Irving says “Myrtle Eagan was 5 CEO’s ago, they never had a woman before”

\-          Which is kind of odd if Myrtle was the second CEO

\-          This is where the 2 year gap in-between Kier and Myrtle might be important

\-          It would make sense that there was a CEO that is missing in this display

\-          Who was the CEO from 1939-1941?

**Timestamp 37:50**

\-          Irving says that he learned that Lumon has been actively caring for mankind since 1866

\-          Kier Eagan was CEO in 1865, what is with the 1 year disparity?

\-          The wall of smiles

\-          I’m sure some of these smiles can be paired up with characters in the show, I have not done this work yet

\-          Perhaps everyone in the show has a severance chip in their brains

\-          The work that MDR does is wiping and organizing the minds of everyone, perhaps they wipe their own minds as well

\-          Irving says “you are part of a history now”

\-          As in, you don’t exist anymore

**Timestamp 39:10**

\-          We can see the Kier House replica house

\-          Opposite of the house is a black rectangle that looks like it could be a passageway

**Timestamp 39:26**

\-          The Doors that Irving closes behind him have glass windows, the entrance doors were solid

\-          This means that we missed some time between the group entering the house

**Timestamp 39:36**

\-          We are shown Kier’s Blue slippers with Green half moon’s or C’s on them

\-          Helena was wearing a Blue and Green Dress at the gala

\-          Helly wears blue and green in the MDR group photo

\-          I’m curious and will have to keep an eye out to see if any other characters wear both blue and green clothing at the same time

**Timestamp 40:38**

\-          Irving says “It’s the living soul of Lumon and everything ***she*** stands for..”

\-          This could imply that Lumon represent a singular female person

**Timestamp 42:40**

\-          Helly’s note is written in all capitals like usual

\-          Helly cuts her right arm on broken glass from the emergency escape door

\-          We don’t see the note after she is pulled back in, which suggests that the note made it outside and could be found by someone later

**Timestamp 46:00**

\-          A 24-hour clock says 15:17 = 3:17pm

\-          This is the first time that a 24-hour clock has been shown to let us know am/pm via a clock

\-          This same style clock is shown at the Severance building lobby behind Judd the security guard

\-          This could suggest that when Mark is leaving work at ex. 5:05pm, it’s actually 5:05am?

**Timestamp 47:43**

\-          Dylan shuts off the office lights before Mark finds Petey’s map in the picture frame

\-          Perhaps the office camera’s shut off when the lights are turned off, or it’s too dark for the cameras to see what is happening clearly

\-          Mark’s computer is turned off too, which could turn off the hidden camera

**Timestamp 49:43**

\-          At the top of Petey’s map, it looks to me like he drew a “Mind Virus”

\-          The Circle around “Mind” looks like maybe the severance implant

\-          The red is reminiscent of the red coil in the chip

\-          A biological virus is generally depicted with red “spike glycoproteins” surrounding it

**Timestamp 50:45**

\-          oMark steps out of the elevator after work

\-          Judd the security guard is not there

\-          We are not shown the wall clock this time

\-          This could mean that iMark spent quite a long time looking over the map and may have even followed it somewhere

**Timestamp 51:26**

\-          It looks much darker outside this time after Mark leaves work, which suggests Mark is either leaving much later than usual or this could be skipping days where the winter days are shorter and thus darker

**Timestamp 51:40**

\-          As Mark returns home and walks down his basement stairs, the plastic storage container is not stacked against the wall

**Timestamp 52:14**

\-          An ambulance is driving by Mark

\-          The direction the ambulance comes from is over the bridge, which might suggest it is a Lumon ambulance sent to take care of Petey

\-          The colours of the ambulance are Blue and Green, which are Kier colours

\-          It seems like everything in this town is being run by Kier, which suggests a controlled environment

\-          Maybe “outside” is not so “out” as Mark thinks

**Timestamp 53:05**

\-          “Kier Police” with an emblem of the bridge

\-          The Police officer is wearing a hat that makes me think of a Russian uniform

**Timestamp 53:35**

\-          You can hear the Paramedics saying “whoa whoa whoa, he’s down he’s down” before Petey falls down

One day i saw one coffee shop topping up with some ready made concentrate(?) from something that looks like a 4 litre plastic container. There after I've seen one or two others top up using a similar plastic container, but I couldn't see the label. 

I'm pretty sure they're the same, since they have a very similar taste profile, and they taste good. I think it tastes better than the Nestea powder used in many places (such as Mosburger). However, a few of the shops using the concentrate(?) are increasing their prices and diluting the drinks down.. I wanna make my own to drink at my leisure!

I am a 24 year old woman who works full-time in marketing. Lately I’ve been having a really hard time with staying focused at work, to the point I sit at my desk and stare at my computer, doing nothing, even when I have things to do.

When I started my job, I was taking Adderall to help me stay focused, but it didn’t mix well with the birth control I’m on, so I went off the Adderall and started drinking mushroom coffee to help focus. That only really worked for about a month; it seems like my body has built a tolerance for it, and I have to have multiple cups a day. Even then, that’s not working anymore because my body is so used to it now. I don’t want to go back on Adderall, since that combined with the birth control caused cycle issues for me, but I’m not sure what else to do.

I’ve tried productivity methods like time blocking, the pomodoro timer, and more, but I cannot get myself to focus on my work. It doesn’t help that the work I do is really boring and is often changed with little to no feedback (that’s a whole other story). Plus, more often than not, I don’t have enough work to keep me busy during the day, even during periods where I’m feeling more motivated/productive. My annual review is coming up, and I have a feeling my boss is going to say something about my lack of productivity, so I want to try to improve myself before then.

1icqyz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Synesthesia/comments/1icqyz0/is_this_synesthesia_spatial_experience/,Is this synesthesia? (Spatial experience),"Hi! I am well aware that I am a synesthete, as I have some very classic forms of synesthesia (my mind assigns color, texture, shape, density, and to some degree characteristic traits to items including letters, numbers, musical notes, and sounds themselves — and I am an associator, experiencing it in my mind’s eye rather than projecting it and physically perceiving it). However, over the past year I’ve become increasingly aware that this is what I believe to be only the tip of the iceberg of my synesthesia, and in reality, synesthesia is potentially so much more than what I had perceived it to be — and maybe even in how the world generally understands synesthesia, at this point?

But as I have not yet seen the specific, possibly-synesthetic experience I’m referring to described anywhere, by anyone else, I want to try and explain it here and see what other synesthetes think. Is it synesthesia, and if so, how would you define it in terms of category?

So, what it is, is basically:

I experience physical space very intensely, in that in any given moment, I can ‘feel’ the space very particularly around me, and it is like I possess a hyperawareness of my environment that others just seem completely blind to. This is very difficult to describe, largely because I’ve never really heard anyone else resonate with this experience. It is like I ‘feel’ spaces around me in terms of dimension (high up, low down, very left, very right, diagonal, stuffy, boomy, flat, sprawling, curving, rising, falling, etcetera), as well as a variety of textures, temperatures, densities, etc (thick, thin, viscous, airy, wet, dry, smooth, glossy, rough, warm, cool, glowy, dull, heavy, light, hard, soft — basically, there’s so much dimension to it — the list of possible spatial ‘feelings’ can just go on, and on, and on). 

Then, in terms of how my mind compartmentalizes and recalls space, I’ll see it (and feel it) in my mind’s eye with these varieties of dimensions and textures, but with literal shapes as well: recalling the space of a city may become a variety of endless large, concrete walls in my mind — but here’s the thing: they’re not images of skyscrapers. They are literally these mysterious, hulking concrete slabs, which I sense with a visceral strength — in those slabs I sense the textures, which includes density, warmth, etc. I can feel the walls closing in on me and shifting around. Or maybe I will sense sprawling plains, for the remembrance of a different location that was outdoors and very open. It \*isn’t\* just a mental image of the place itself, though, because it is like… a new shape has been derived from that space. And these shapes are… something in and of themselves.

These shapes are incredible, because I can feel them so intensely. As I’ve been saying that I ‘feel’ them in textures and warmth, etc, but I associate rather than project, what I mean by this is that I do not \*physically\* feel temperatures or textures with these shapes, but instead I feel these inner sensations within the “mind’s eye,” only it’s more like it’s within the “mind’s touch,” because it’s about textures. This is super hard to explain because I feel like it’s a sixth sense that you have to experience to understand — it’s like trying to explain a color someone’s never seen! (This is assuming, however, that other people don’t experience this — for all I know, this is a natural human phenomenon that most people possess.) That said: it is like, all within my mind’s eye without any external sensation, I am \*feeling\* a space’s shape is warm, or that a space’s shape is soft, or that a space’s shape is really really heavy and dense, like a super heavy, compacted metal sphere. It is not simply that I am \*thinking\* about it being these textures… I am \*feeling\* it being these textures… but not externally on my skin… internally, in my mind!! (Yes, there’s no good way to explain this, I don’t think…)

So… this process happens with everything. Pretty much everything. I call it ‘spatial orientation.’ Every new spatial environment that I experience will take on new shapes, and i will not just see those shapes in my head but intensely feel them all around me in these textures and temperatures and densities of that sixth sense. In this way, if it is synesthesia, it’s not like it has some ‘set’ trigger, like a calendar or TV show spatially orienting itself in my mind. The trigger is any external object in any external space that I happen to interact with. So: everything. And, unlike spatial sequence synesthesia (from my not-super-knowledgeable understanding of it, at least), it isn’t simply something that I ‘see’ in my mind’s eye — not to sound redundant, but, \*I feel it all around me,\* and in so many textures. 

I’m not trying to make this super long, but it’s just so extensive and so hard to describe. Its shapes correlates with my synesthesia for sounds, which gives me evidence that it is synesthesia. By which I mean, I also sense sounds as being particular shapes with colors and a variety of textures that I can also, just as with space, \*feel\* in the sixth sense, not just see (although I see it too in my mind’s eye). There is also a predictable system across all these synesthetic forms for how things work: complexity, for example, is portrayed by what I call “gridding,” which is this phenomenon where all the shapes from sounds or space will reduplicate into infinity to create gridded duplicates of the same thing over and over again, all around me, 360°, on a 3D axis, and this signifies in my mind that that something is complex, inspiring, and euphoric. Gridding = high energy. I love grids. I therefor love drinking coffee with ice in it, for example, because ice cubes are like the shape of grids, and when I drink it, my mind spatially orients the coffee in my mind as being a complex grid of reduplicating coffee-ice cubes. I sense wonderful textures in the space around me then, because I sense gridded, three-dimensional coffee all around my surrounding environment on that 360° frame of reference. So spatial orientation applies to… literally everything!! Literally everything that I experience generates these shapes.

Another final example I want to give of this bizarre spatial orientation experience that definitely screams “synesthesia” to me is what I call the Primordial Attic Sense (PAS). At certain times throughout my life, I will suddenly get this really intense spatial orientation that sets in all around me, where I can sense very viscerally that an attic is looming far above my head, and that this attic is primordial — I sense it temporally as occurring at the dawn of time — and it is embedded with staircases, triangles, the color yellow, the number 3, and, to some degree as well, springtime. It is dangerously foreboding and sacredly important at the same time. That is the best way I can describe the PAS. It reoccurs in a variety of contexts and sometimes its occurrence will throw me off, but it is always strongly felt and \*very recognizable\* amongst all my other spatial orientations, just because of how intense it feels when it chooses to return to me. Some places I’ve felt it include: at the top of staircases in the daytime, on a lawn on a hot summer day, and walking through a field at twilight while listening to a song whose shape is also primordial. I love the PAS when it appears, but as you can see, um… some of these spatial orientations can get very, very complicated.

So… any thoughts? This is seriously just the tip of the iceberg too, which is why I think synesthesia might be really misunderstood or not fully represented for all its depth and complexity right now as the world understands it. Because to me this does not fit well into any categorization or “synesthesia test.” Do you think it’s a form of synesthesia, and if so, do any particular categorizations come to mind? Have you experienced anything like this yourself?

This is a bit nerve wrecking but here it goes. I'm not really sure what to say so I'll just be honest. I've been feeling unusually blue and down lately after a missed connection / misunderstanding with someone I met here that I grew very fond of. And for someone who is an empath and usually prefers the company of higher frequency beings like animals, trees, and sunshine I do find myself wanting the comfort of a warm hug from a kind soul.  I don't usually put myself out there, but even the strong need someone to lean on from time to time, yes?

I'm always growing and transforming, I keep pretty busy between work and a program I'm currently enrolled in, and have always been strong, resilient, and independent. I have good intuition, am typically introverted and enjoy my solitude despite being well socialized and friendly in group settings. I'm usually the one people gravitate towards when they have some heaviness they need to unload, and I've been the keeper of many a dark secret, but now I find myself the one wanting to find comfort in the presence of another. I usually find animals, poetry, my journal, and music to be the safest to turn to, in all honesty, and I spend my days working with dogs, which is amazing and wonderful, but I'm still human despite being deeply attuned to the etheric realm, and it would be lovely to meet someone of the two-legged variety that has the capacity to provide safe, compassionate, comfortable quiet moments, without the expectation of anything sexual. I'm open to ages 25+ and looking for someone that is mature and grounded with enough life experience to understand the value of presence and authenticity, who is naturally caring and kind, and does not have a fragile ego. Humor and whimsy are also good and will be much appreciated. I am a 4w5 so I'm very comfortable with uncomfortable feelings, I don't need saving. Just companionship.

I'm equal parts left and right brained, can talk about any topic with greater interest in broader humanitarian causes and social justice, or things related to personal growth and self improvement, than politics per se. I have a degree from a fancy college despite my ACEs, first in my immigrant family to graduate, mentally and financially sound and responsible. I don't partake in drugs of any sort, nor shrooms, and don't drink though I don't mind if others around me occasionally do. When I'm not out walking/hiking or grocery shopping, I enjoy cooking at home, making eggs and pancakes and coffee for breakfast, and just putzing around my place tidying up, or sitting outside enjoying a cup of coffee or tea and listening to the birds. I lead a pretty healthy active lifestyle, am 5'4"" tall and height/weight proportionate, with long brunette/dark hair, light tan skin tone, brown eyes, and glasses. Minimal makeup/natural look.

If you are similarly equal parts emotionally intelligent, mentally sound, financially responsible, with healthy self-esteem, generally happy with your work, and value integrity, kindness, and authenticity feel free to say hello.

Welp! I guess that about covers the major points. Thanks for reading!

With the right [home furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) choices, you can create a cozy, well-organized space that feels both stylish and spacious. Whether you're furnishing a compact apartment or making the most of a small room, the right furniture solutions can help you achieve a perfect balance between form and function. Here are some smart furniture ideas to help you maximize your small space efficiently.

**1. Choose Multi-Functional Furniture**

When space is limited, every piece of furniture should serve more than one purpose. Consider investing in:

* **Storage ottomans** that double as seating.
* **Sofa beds** for guests and lounging.
* **Foldable dining tables** that can be extended when needed.
* **Wall-mounted desks** that free up floor space.

Multi-functional pieces help eliminate clutter and provide additional storage, making your space feel more open.

**2. Opt for Lightweight & Versatile Seating**

Seating is essential, but bulky chairs can make a small room feel crowded. A [rattan armchair](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/valencia-rattan-armchair) is a perfect solution—lightweight, stylish, and easy to move around. Its open-weave design adds an airy feel to any space, making it ideal for small living rooms, bedrooms, or cozy reading nooks.

If you’re looking for [chairs for sale](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/armchairs), consider stackable or foldable options that can be tucked away when not in use.

**3. Go Vertical with Storage**

When floor space is limited, think vertically! Wall-mounted shelves, tall bookcases, and floating cabinets are excellent for maximizing storage without taking up much room. Consider using vertical storage for:

* Books and decor items.
* Kitchen essentials.
* Bedroom storage solutions like wall-mounted nightstands.

This approach keeps your floor clear and makes the room appear taller and more spacious.

**4. Use Mirrors & Light Colors to Create the Illusion of Space**

Mirrors reflect light and make any room appear bigger. A large wall mirror or mirrored furniture can help brighten a space while creating the illusion of depth. Similarly, opting for light-colored furniture, such as white or neutral tones, enhances the airy feel of a small home.

**5. Incorporate Space-Saving Tables & Coffee Tables**

In a compact space, traditional bulky coffee tables can take up too much room. Instead, choose:

* **Nesting tables** that can be stacked when not in use.
* **Wall-mounted or drop-leaf tables** for dining or work.
* **Slim console tables** that serve as entryway storage or workstations.

These alternatives provide the necessary surface area without overwhelming your space.

**6. Bring in Rattan Furniture for an Airy Aesthetic**

[Rattan furniture UAE](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/rattan) is a fantastic choice for small spaces because of its lightweight yet durable nature. Whether it's a rattan armchair, coffee table, or shelving unit, this natural material adds warmth and texture without making a space feel crowded. Plus, its neutral tones blend effortlessly with any decor style, making it a timeless investment.

**7. Invest in Smart Bedroom Solutions**

For bedrooms with limited space, consider:

* **Bed frames with built-in storage** for clothing, linens, and other essentials.
* **Floating nightstands** to free up floor space.
* **Murphy beds** or foldable beds that can be tucked away when not in use.

Maximizing every inch of your bedroom ensures you have a comfortable retreat without unnecessary clutter.

**Final Thoughts**

Small spaces can be just as stylish and functional as larger ones when designed thoughtfully. By incorporating multi-functional furniture, lightweight seating like a rattan armchair, and vertical storage solutions, you can make the most of your home.

i must admit that i’ve overreacted in my mind and i assumed the worst in you. looking back, you have been nothing but a chill and awesome friend even to someone like me.
i am sorry if i cannot make you remember my voice right now. please don’t ask to call me, i hate calls. maybe we’ll run to each other in campus and who knows. i wish we talked sooner when we were in that same class last semester. thank you for having the courage to talk to me. i also admit that i was hesitant to talk to you and maybe i was just bored or curious, nevertheless, i’m glad i was. i have no regrets.

sorry for the little white lies — i got carried away when you mentioned that you once liked me. i had to keep masking because i want to be adored by people, i will not be able to do the same thing for myself. i was afraid that i wouldn’t be that cool girl that you admired, so i had to make up little dumb fake facts. i still refuse to believe that i am the prettiest girl that you’ve ever seen, but i appreciate your thoughts. 

i sincerely hope that you’ll be able to heal from all of your troubles and worries. may you find genuine love with someone, it is never too late.. better die loving than nothing.

i have been battling so many emotions and difficulties in my personal life, as i’ve told back then. once again, i will have to isolate myself until i will have the courage and energy to get up and be able to look people in the eyes.

i’m afraid that this is where our short-lived friendship will end. clearly, i lied when i said that i’m a “nice friend” because i am never that nice and i am never a friend. i have no friends apart from my lover. the friends i told you about does not exist but they were the friends i wished to have. but now, i will have to lose a friend. see you never, and if we do.. well, you know i would appreciate a glass of beer than a coffee. keep blooming the purple flowers near your house and bring some on my graveyard.",1,1738146512.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.67,False

I’m the kind of person who reheats coffee three times before I remember I left it in the microwave, so when I saw this Nextmug self-heating coffee mug, I was intrigued to say the least.

Here's my thoughts.

# Update:

**BEST PRICE on the Nextmug here:**

# First Impressions

When I first heard about the Nextmug, I thought oh great, another gadget I don’t need but will absolutely buy because I have no self-control. A self-heating mug? I know, it's the most frivolous purchase ever, but I had to have it.

I needed this mug. I’m the person who microwaves their coffee three times before giving up and drinking it cold. I’m the person who forgets their mug exists until it’s too late. I’m the person who once cried because I spilled coffee on my laptop. The Nextmug promised to solve all these problems, and I was ready to throw my money at it.

When it arrived, I was struck by how sleek it looked. Matte black, minimalist design, no weird logos screaming “HEY, I’M A TECH MUG!”  I immediately felt cooler just holding it.

# My Favorite Features

**Temperature control.**  You can set your coffee to 130°F (Warm), 140°F (Hot), or 150°F (Piping). I started with Piping because I’m an overachiever, but quickly realized my tongue isn’t made of asbestos. Hot is my sweet spot—it’s like sipping coffee straight from the pot

**No app required.** The on-board button is simple: press to turn on, press again to cycle through temperatures. No Bluetooth, no passwords, no “Why won’t this stupid thing connect?!” moments.

**Spill-resistant lid.** It keeps my coffee hot longer and prevents spills when I inevitably knock the mug over while gesturing wildly during Zoom meetings.

**Battery life and charging coaster.** The mug charges on a docking coaster, which is basically a tiny throne for your coffee. The battery lasts about 2-3 hours on a single charge (with the lid on), which is enough to get me through my morning existential crisis.

**Comfortable design.** The handle is comfortable, the weight is balanced, and the ceramic finish feels premium. It’s like holding a tiny piece of luxury, if luxury were defined by my ability to drink hot coffee without crying.

**LED indicators.** The LED lights show the battery life and temperature setting. It’s intuitive and doesn’t require a PhD in Mugology to understand.

# Pros

* **No more cold coffee.** This is the obvious one, but it’s great. My coffee stays hot for hours, which means I can actually enjoy it instead of chugging it like a maniac.

* **No app.** I can’t stress enough how much I appreciate not having to deal with an app. It’s one less thing to frustrate me before I’ve had my caffeine fix.

* **Great gift idea.** If you know someone who loves coffee, this is the perfect gift. It’s practical, thoughtful, and makes you look like a genius.

# Cons

* **Battery life could be better.** While 2-3 hours is decent, it could always be better. If you’re a slow sipper, you might need to recharge mid-morning.

* **Pricey.** It’s not cheap. But hey, if you’re the kind of person who cries over cold coffee, it’s still probably worth it.

* **Heating from cold is slow.** If you pour cold coffee into the mug, it takes a while to heat up and drains the battery faster. You gotta stick to hot liquids for best results.

# Final Thoughts

The Nextmug is perfect for coffee lovers who refuse to settle for lukewarm mediocrity. If you’re the kind of person who forgets their coffee exists until it’s cold (me), this mug will probably change your life or something.

That said, if you’re the type who chugs their coffee in five minutes or doesn’t care about temperature, this might be overkill.

We’ve been friends for about 6 years now. I love her to death, and she’s probably my closest friend. Whenever we hang out we almost always get coffee from somewhere. Usually At some point in the hangout she’ll take a few sips from my coffee- Whether it’s because her mouth is dry, she finished hers first or she simply wants to try what I’m having. I’m not usually a huge germaphobe but that is one thing that bothers me. And The fact that she doesn’t even ask before she does it is also not helping. 

How can I tell her that it makes me uncomfortable without hurting her feelings? I don’t know how to word it without it coming off the wrong way. ",5,1738146266.0,FriendshipAdvice,5,1.0,False
