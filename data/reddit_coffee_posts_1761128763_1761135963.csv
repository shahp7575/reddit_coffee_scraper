I know this might seem obvious, and I'm sure most people are already living with a pretty tight budget, but I know I, for one, will be not eating out at all, not even coffee, not shopping except for absolute essentials, and donating any extra money to food banks. I know there is a risk of this causing the government to simply add feeding people that use these benefits back onto the shoulders of the everyday American and food banks, but perhaps if the big corporations that they actually care about lose money on a big way (other than just the money from EBT) that will send a better message with the added benefit of saving us money. Good luck to you all, and I hope as few people as possible, especially those that did not vote for this, go hungry.",1,1761135857.0,50501,1,1.0,False

Ignored it bc what else can I do. Last night I felt super exhausted but thought it was bc I exercised and was sore. Today I woke up feeling like I’ve been hit by a bus. All the symptoms I can imagine all at once but especially weakness. I ordered DayQuil DoorDash but it never came so I just cancelled the order. I have a babysitter coming at 915, she doesn’t care if we’re sick she’ll still come. My husband cut some fruit up for my kids, left me toast and coffee, and ran out the door. He works an office job and can easily be a few hours late. I needed him to stay until the babysitter comes but he just ran away basically. I physically can’t care for my kids, they’re 1 and 3 and the 1 year old won’t even watch tv or anything, all he wants to do is for me to hold him and be standing or walking. I can’t do it. I feel so angry at my husband for not checking on me to make sure I was able to last til 915. It was only 2 hours. I know this sounds very spoiled and petty but I’ve been listening to my baby just cry it out for an hour now and I’m going to pass out or throw up. I wish someone would just check on me or help me. My whole life is caring for my family and no one checks on me. My husband told me to eat some raspberry jam in black tea or eat this weird butter ghee thing his mom made for our toddler last week when he had pneumonia in the hospital. My parents live 30 mins away but they’re horrible people and we have no relationship with them. I have a mom friend and whenever her and her family get sick I bring them soup or a small treat for her toddler. They’re sick now and I was going to do that again but I realized they’ve never once did that for me. So I’m not doing it. Times like this just highlight how alone I am. 

Never in a million years would or could my husband be left with our kids by himself while he’s sick like this. But I’m supposed to just do it. ",1,1761135798.0,SAHP,0,1.0,False
1od6rfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agadir/comments/1od6rfm/travelling_solo/,Travelling solo,"Good day folks!

I am M-35 from 🇫🇮.

The days here in the north are getting shorter—not to mention colder. I’m not ready for that. I hate it. It’s a harsh reality we have to face year after year, but I figured I’d give myself a little time to adjust to the idea. So... screw you, winter.

I’ve booked flights to Agadir and back, and I’ve got a roof over my head for a week (27th Oct–3rd Nov), but that’s basically it. I have a full-time job and I’m also working towards a master’s degree, so I’m not exactly short on things to do. Still, it could be a nice change of pace to occupy life with something different.

There are rumors of a nice beachfront in Agadir, where I fully intend to wear down the soles of my sneakers. I might even hit the gym on some days—gotta keep middle age at bay. From what I’ve gathered, there isn’t a whole lot happening in Agadir, so I’ve considered doing an overnight trip to Marrakesh if the grass is indeed greener there.

In conclusion, here are some things I might be interested in doing. If there are other adventurous spirits out there who’d like to join for any of these, hit me up:

Overnight trip to Marrakesh (round-trip by bus):
• Wander the streets & chill
• Attend a local football game (if there’s one happening)
• Stay the night in a riad
• Hot air balloon ride in the early morning?

Agadir:
• Grab a coffee, lunch, or go for a run together
• Visit the Sunday market
• Check out Croco Park
• Attend any local events

Feel free to suggest other ideas too, if none of the above appeal to you. I can offer company, stories from the north, and bad jokes—the last one is non-negotiable.

Wishing you a great week ahead. Stay awesome!

We live in the Netherlands, flew from Brussels to JFK and back from Newark to Brussels, both flights via London. I bought New York Passes before we left which allowed us to visit 5 hotspots. 80% of the spots where we ate I found searching Reddit and it did not dissapoint.

**Saturday 11 Oct** \- Landed around 4pm, immigration hall was completely full with people so I downloaded the Mobile Passport Control app using my pre-configured US e-sim, scanned passports, took selfies and then joined a different line with about 8 people in front of me. Immigration officer was a very nice guy and 10 minutes later we were walking towards the Air Train. I think the app saved us 1-1,5 hours right there. Took the train to Penn Station and checked in at the Doxie Hotel. It was already dark so we went to Times Square so we got that out off the way. Man it was busy. Went to the Brooklyn Diner and had a cheeseburger menu with a very nice milkshake. Back to the hotel and sleep. 11.529 steps

**Sunday 12 Oct** \- A lot of rain was predicted, so shops and a museum was the plan.But first, breakfast. Went to best bagel and coffee, there was no line so as Europeans we had no idea what to order and how quickly you're supposed to choose. So we let the guy behind the corner pick some bagels for us. He probably took advantage of that because I paid $65 for 3 bagels and 3 drinks. 😂 Bagels were excellent though and enough to skip lunch. Then we went to Macy's and went in when they just opened. The staff clapped and cheered when we came in and the girls loved that. Around 1pm it was still dry, so we decided to go to the Intrepid Air and Space Museum. Started to rain in the afternoon and made a stop at the hotel. Then went out to buy some umbrella's. More shopping and some book stores and it was time for diner. Took the subway for Pizza at John's of Bleecker Street. Waited outside for about 25 minutes to be seated, but the pizza was very good. After that, some more shopping, got the girls some ""not-so-standard"" NYC sweaters at Mure and Grand - West Village. Back to the hotel and sleep. 23,657 steps.

**Monday 13 Oct** \- More rain. So decided to go to the American Museum of Natural History. But first, breakfast at Andrews NYC Diner. Very good food (I had the pancakes), but way too much for my daughters. Took the subway to the AMNH. When we got out of the station there was a very long line stretching around the corner from the left side of the building so we just followed others and joined at the back. After around 30 minutes in line, we got to the entrance only to be told that the line we were in was for ticket holders. The New York Pass tickets we had, had to be converted so we were directed to the other line which went around the corner on the right side of the building! We had no idea about this system and we cut the line for the other queue because we felt we had paid our time in the line. Got some angry looks and comments. Museum was great though. After 3 hours the girls had enough. Took the subway again to visit the FAO Schwarz toy store. Since they were little, they always talked about the Build a Bear stores and we never got to visit one. Until now. Told them to both pick a bear and get them dressed. Great to see that even my eldest could finally see that wish come true. She's studying to be a doctor, so she got one with some scrubs.   Then we went to the FDNY store where my girls got me a t-shirts and the eldes one bought a FDNY rain coat for our dog at home. Talked with some guys there as I am a volunteer firefighter. Showed them our rig and they called it a u-haul. 🤣Had a great time there. Then it was time to eat. My youngest wanted to go to Raising Cane's because she saw it on TikTok. So we did. She loved it, but I didn't hink it was anything special. Back to hotel and sleep. 18,215 steps.

**Tuesday 14 oct** \- Rain was almost gone, but it was very overcast so a good day to visit the 9/11 memorial and museum. Got breakfast at RaminiEspresso and cafe which had really great coffee. Took the subway to Chambers street so we could walk towards the 9/11 site.  The museum was extremely impressive, especially the part where you're not allowed to take pictures. I watched a lot of 9/11 documentaries but I saw some things I'd never seen before. My youngest cried when see saw some children's drawings about their missing dad or moms. The museum definitely made an impression on us. After that we went to the FDNY Engine 7, Ladder 1, Battalion 1 house where the famous 9/11 documentary by the Baudet brothers was filmed. Was shown around by the Station Watch on duty and had a great chat. Then we got some quick lunch at a Starbucks and as the weather cleared up we then took the subway to Brooklyn. Got off at the first stop and walked to Brooklyn Heights and then strolled around DUMBO and got the ""iconic bridge spot"" photos. Saw the Brooklyn Ice Cream factory and mentioned to my daughters that previously they were in a small cute light house and when I turned around there it was. But now it hosted the ""Van Leeuwen"" ice cream company. Got some milkshakes there (which were truly excellent) before walking the Brooklyn bridge back towards Manhattan. We walked around the financial district a bit, saw the New York Stock Exchange and then went for early diner to Squire's Diner. Great burger, great staff. No tourist in sight. Got the subway uptown and went to Top of The Rock. Girls absolutely loved the city views at night.  Then back to the hotel and sleep. 30.131 steps.

**Wednesday 15 oct** \- Weather was very nice, got breakfast at Angelina Bakery (yummy). Took the subway, walk half of the Highline Park, went to some Taylor Swift spots like Cornelia street and a book store where she recored a video (my eldest is a swiftie). Hung around Washington Square Park for a bit  and then went to the Staten Island ferry. Took that both ways and got back on the subway and had a milkshake in Madison Square park before walking around the New York Public Library for a bit. We then went to the Empire State building and watched the sunset from the 102nd floor which was absolutely stunning. Very crowded though (to be expected). Then had dinner at Lazzara's Pizza Cafe, I had the weekly special with pepperoni and honey if I remember correctly and it was amazing. Back to the hotel to rest and sleep. 18,704 steps.

**Thursday 16 Oct** \- Weather was very sunny but quite cold in the morning. Went to Breads Bakery (close to central park) for breakfast, then strolled through Central Park. After that we got on the Roosevelt Air Tram and then walked a bit on the island with some great views along the waterside. Then it was time to go back to the hotel for the check out. Did some souvenir shopping, got one last shake, from Five Guys this time. Also very nice. Then went to Penn station and took the train to Newark Airport where we had a late lunch bite and 1,5 hours later we were in the air on our way back home. 6,259 steps.

We had a great time in the city and my girls want to go back already. :)",2,1761135537.0,visitingnyc,0,1.0,False

1od6msm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1od6msm/my_father_in_law_called_one_of_my_daughters/,My father in law called one of my daughters naughty and manipulative (to her face),"Hey, 

Context, me and my wife have twin 3 year olds. Both have their challenges, but my youngest is a delicate little soul, she gets upset at the tiniest of things and this recently came to a head with my FIL. 

They came around for dinner and whilst I was still working (I WFH, I heard all of this) my youngest burst into tears that she'd lost her favourite comforter, not angry, genuinely upset. She asked mum to help her find it upstairs and FIL made a comment that she had her wrapped around her little finger and was manipulating her (again, in front of her). Wife suggested FIL go with her to find the comforter however she screamed ""I don't want him, I want mummy"" to which his response was ""gosh you're a really naughty girl"", followed her upstairs teasing her that she doesn't have the comforter. 

We were stunned, our little girl now repeats that she's a naughty girl because he said so and she's mean. This was a kid that was genuinely in bits.

Now we've reached out to him, said it's not OK to speak to her like that and if he has opinions on her behaviour raise it to us directly and that she's still incredibly upset. His response is that it's his opinion. Not a 'I'm sorry', nothing. 

My wife already has a fractious relationship with him, he broke contact with her when she was 16 and we only initiated a relationship again because we felt it was fair that he knows he's a grandpa. She wants to completely cut ties. I've suggested last chance saloon at a mutual meet up at a coffee shop to discuss. But the main point here is our little girls and I will always do best for them, my other twin adores my FIL.

 I’m writing this now because sleep isn’t happening, and because the smell is back—the wax, that animal tallow stink I can’t wash off my hands no matter what I try. My name is Diego, I’m from Madrid, 32, project geotech for a small firm. Last weekend—Saturday night, October 11, 2025—I went out to the woods above a village in Lugo province with two friends, Mateo and Iván. We weren’t chasing anything supernatural. We wanted to finish a mapping job and make it fun with an overnight at a ruined hermitage that locals swear is safe if you keep quiet and don’t provoke the place. It was supposed to be easy overtime: cross-check coordinates, test a drone path over chestnut groves, sleep under a roof older than any of us.



 We’ve known each other since university—field labs, cheap beer, and colder mornings. Mateo films everything; he edits workplace videos into mini-docs nobody watches except our moms. Iván is the practical one, recently divorced, the kind of guy who checks the spare before he checks the map. I’m the one who says yes to too many things. The plan was simple: drive up, grab a caldo at the village bar, hike to the hermitage before twilight, shoot stars, test the drone grid for Monday’s survey, sleep, and go home before lunch on Sunday.



 The bar smelled like soup and wet wool. The old man at the counter—Emilio, he said, though everyone called him don—asked where we were sleeping. When we told him the hermitage name, he pressed his lips together, then laid a small ashtray on the table like it was a talisman. He said certain nights the woods are crowded in ways you don’t see. Don’t answer if someone calls you by name, he told us. If you feel a gift pressed into your hand, drop it. If the wind goes still and you smell wax, step inside a circle of ash and wait without speaking. We smiled and promised we’d be careful. He didn’t smile back.



 We left the bar into a drizzle that turned to a fine mist by the time we reached the trailhead. Galicia does damp like a second atmosphere. The path threaded between chestnut and oak, the kind of green that eats sound. The hermitage sat on a shoulder of rock above the village; we could see its slate roof when the trees opened. Mateo was talking about timelapses of moving cloud; Iván showed me a photo of his little boy with a plastic dinosaur, the first thing to make him smile all week. Everything felt normal. Better than normal, honestly. Work had been loud and here it was very quiet.



 The hermitage was exactly as Google had promised: four walls, one door hanging wrong on rusty hinges, and an altar made of the same stone as the hill. We set the stove on a flat rock, ate bread and cheese and the last of the caldo in plastic. Mateo whistled softly as he fitted the tripod plates; Iván stretched his bad knee and grunted. I felt that city static peel off me. After sunset the clouds burned away and the sky went fierce, stars speaking like they only do far from streetlights. We were three men and the cold, and it was good.



 On our second pass to fetch water from a rivulet below the clearing, we cut a corner and found a fork I didn’t remember from the map. In the center someone had traced a ring of ash. It wasn’t a campfire ring—too clean, too careful—and there were drips of wax on a stone the way kids make when they tilt a candle over paper. A small cross of twigs lay half-buried, soggy. I kicked it gently and it slid with a rasp. Iván said some village kids must’ve played at Holy Week. Mateo squatted to film and then stood quickly, shaking his head like a horse does when a fly touches its eye.



 We put the drone up to check canopy gaps, but it came home early with a full battery like it had hit a ceiling we couldn’t see. Mateo swore softly, tapped the controller, sent it again. Same thing. While he fiddled, Iván and I noticed a leaning cross—two sticks tied with string—propped across the path we’d just taken in. It hadn’t been there ten minutes earlier. I set it aside without thinking. The air felt heavier, like a shop before closing where the clerks are waiting for you to leave.



 We got proper night around eleven-thirty. The headlamps went red to save our night vision; the stove ticked. When I checked my phone for the time later, the lock screen said 01:07 with the seconds frozen—no signal, just the hour like a painted sign. I locked it, opened again. 01:07. It was funny until it wasn’t. Somewhere to our right, down the slope, a man’s voice said my name. Not loud—more like a greeting from a neighbor turning the corner. Diego. The way my mother says it when I answer the phone distracted. I turned halfway and caught Iván’s sleeve. Don’t answer, he said, and I realized he was kneading his jaw like it hurt.



 We killed our headlamps and crouched behind a low stone. The lights we thought were farmhouses moving through the trees were not farmhouses. They were hand-held, a wavering little chain of gold sliding along the slope. I smelled the sea for a moment, impossible so far inland, brine cutting through leaf rot. Mateo raised the camera but didn’t press record. Between trunks I saw shoulders hunched under hoods, faces like washed-out photographs, and at the front a taller figure carrying a cross that looked heavier than any one of us would want to lift. The candle flames burned steady even when the mist licked at them. Somewhere behind us the voice said my name again, softer. Diego.



 We held as the column passed below, but the front figure turned uphill, smudged by branches, and without hurry came toward us until I could have touched the cross. A second hand lifted, offering it, patient. I’d like to pretend I remembered Don Emilio’s warning quickly, that I dropped my own hand instantly, but the truth is I reached and only stopped because the wood felt cold in a way wood isn’t supposed to. My palm came away wet, slicked with a wax that wasn’t quite wax. The world tilted an inch. Mateo hissed my name through his teeth like he could pull me backward with it.



 We ran without dignity. The procession didn’t chase. It didn’t need to. Tracks we knew a couple of hours earlier refused to be where we left them. The nearest structure was a hórreo, a granary on stone legs ten meters off the path, and we piled into it and dragged the warped door nearly shut. The slats let in threads of light and the smell of old grain and mouse. Outside, candle-glow passed like a tethered river. My palm burned cold where the not-wax had smeared; when I wiped it on my pants it left a dull sheen like oil.



 The latch rattled lightly with no wind to move it. Then something small and pale pressed under the door: not a finger but the idea of one, a bulge of wax finding space the way water does. I stamped and it flattened, smearing, then gathered itself again—slow, patient—until Iván ground his boot hard enough to drive it back. He whispered a prayer I didn’t know he knew, not showy, just words from somewhere older than us. Mateo said please twice, to the room or to the air. Someone outside moved past, a sound like cloth brushing bark, measured as a tolling bell.



 I tore open the ashes tin from the stove, hands shaking so badly I almost dumped it into the gaps in the planks, and traced a ring around us on the splintered boards. It felt ridiculous until it didn’t. When the circle closed the light from outside thinned, like fogged glass between us and them. The latch lifted and dropped once, twice, nine times—counting the knocks made my throat hurt. None of us spoke. The smell of tallow was so strong I could taste it, fat and old. Through the slats I could see sandals but no feet in them, just the leather, and then nothing at all, like a page turned.



 Dawn came like someone lifting a wet cloth. When we finally opened the door the air moved again and the birds made the usual cheap jokes. On the threshold hung a new stick cross from the latch we hadn’t fastened, twine still wet. In the mud below the steps were footprints—naked, human-looking, all heading away downhill toward the stream, no pattern of return. On the granary floor the ash circle was scuffed but unbroken. I picked up a loose ribbon I thought was trash and saw my initials stitched in tarnished thread. D G. I don’t own anything with embroidery.



 We didn’t talk about it as we packed, because talking would mean deciding whether it had happened. The hermitage looked like a postcard you could buy in any petrol station: pious ruin, forgettable. I scrubbed my left palm with sand and water until it went raw, but the sheen remained and the smell stayed, like I’d been helping butcher something. On the way down none of us wanted to be first; none of us wanted to be last. We returned the drone to its case like we were apologizing to it.



 Back in Madrid I told myself we’d been overwrought in a place geared for ghost stories. I kept telling myself while I scoured with dish soap, with coffee grounds, with rubbing alcohol until my skin protested and the smell lingered anyway. I slept a few hours Monday and woke at 1:07 a.m. exactly with the sound of slow steps in the hall outside my apartment, steps that stopped at my door and then continued past like a neighbor pacing with a baby. Tuesday, the same. Wednesday, I dreamed I was carrying something heavy down rows of trees and the weight wasn’t a burden but a task I’d been given long ago, something I’d forgotten and was glad to remember.



 Thursday I opened Mateo’s shared folder to sort survey clips. Most files were perfect: shaky jokes, skyline, Iván complaining about his knees. One clip I didn’t recognize started black, then showed the three of us crossing the clearing in a jittering gold light. The camera was low, like set on the ground. We passed in front of it and I froze. I was barefoot. I don’t remember losing my boots. A black strap crossed my chest and something long and dark rose over my shoulder. The timeline said 00:03 on October 12. Behind me, Mateo and Iván kept a respectful distance with their heads dipped like mourners. I closed the laptop so fast the mug jumped.



 That night Don Emilio called. He shouldn’t have had my number, but he said Iván gave it to him to ask if we’d found a rosary. No, I said, we hadn’t borrowed anything. He hummed in a toothless way and told me not to answer if someone came to return what I’d already taken, and to check my bags for anything that wasn’t mine. After we hung up, I opened my pack and found, beneath the drone charger, a strap of cracked black leather that smelled like smoke and old churches. It fit my chest without adjusting. I put it on the table and went to wash my hands again. When I came back, the strap lay in a neat circle, like it wanted to be a ring around something.



 Earlier today I ducked into the chino shop on the corner for batteries. I passed the shelf of candles and one stub, the cheapest sort, sputtered and took flame. There was no lighter near it, no matches. The clerk didn’t look up. I stood there like an idiot watching the wax run in a line down the side, a perfect thread that reminded me of that thing pushing under the hórreo door. When I got home, the hallway smelled faintly of salt air though I live 600 kilometers from the sea. Something had been pressed into my mailbox slot, and I half-expected a candle to fall. It was empty.



 If you grew up in Galicia you probably have a name for what we stumbled across. I didn’t grow up there, but my grandmother did, and some of her stories wore the same shoes: a procession that moves like an errand, the living conscripted to lead the dead, the weight in your hands a cross you shouldn’t accept. I thought those were for scaring kids into coming home before dark. Tonight, before writing this, I made a small ash circle on a plate because it feels less ridiculous to be ridiculous on purpose than to pretend none of this is happening. The strap they offered me—because I think that’s what it was, an offer—sits coiled like a sleeping snake. I keep smelling wax when the wind is perfectly clean.



 I keep thinking about the video frame and how calm I look carrying that weight. I keep thinking about how the flames didn’t flicker and how the air didn’t move until we drew the circle, and how a ribbon with my initials lay where I’d stand to leave. If this is a prank, it’s a mean one that knows too much. If it isn’t, then there’s a schedule I’m not making but that keeps me anyway at 1:07, the minute my phone learned to be only a sign. It’s late again, and the steps are back in the hall—pace, pause, pace, a knock lower than knuckles, something like wood on wood. I’m going to post this and then sit inside my little ash ring like a child because I don’t know what else to do.

My GI put me on four 1.2g mesalamine pills and said I would likely start to feel better after about four weeks. A couple weeks later, I had a follow-up where I went down to 2 pills daily instead of 4 because I wasn't having diahrrea anymore and wasn't going 10+ times daily. I was however, having severe constipation and when I would finally go, i would go upwards of 10 times again. After about a week or two of going down to 2 pills, I was vomiting, bleeding, and having diahrrea again so she put me back up to 4 pills. Throughout this whole process I've continued to have bad constipation with excruciating pain once I'm finally able to go (I can only go if I induce it with coffee. even with laxatives it took 4 doses and I didn't feel empty). I've also been dealing with horrible joint and overall body pain, like my body is on fire (I can't even drive myself i'm so fatigued or walk around target for more than 10 minutes). A few nights ago I finally went after another week of constipation and ended up in horrible pain, with blood and diarrhea persisting, I also had chills and horrible nausea. I messaged my gi's office and my actual gi dr is on vacation, so her PA eventually responded. She basically said to drink more water, take miralax for constipation, and make an appointment to deal with the constipation (I have one in 2 days). I ended up going to the er a couple days later because I was in so much pain (and also was having persistent chest pain and rapid heart rate). They couldn't really do much there either. But I messaged the pa again to emphasize just how much pain I was in with my body and joint aches, so she ordered stool and blood tests to check for infection. I feel so defeated and lost right now, and I have never been in more pain in my life. I felt like I started to do better and now I'm just back to where I was (just without as many daily bowel movements). My actual gi mentioned that if I get worse or don't do well after a while she will put me on prednisone and then talk about starting something like humira or other biologics. I'm very new to all of this and I just don't know if maybe I'm not being patient enough for my meds to start working, or if it's time to talk about other options.

Imagine driving up to the airport, handing over your keys, and walking straight into the terminal without worrying about parking, shuttles, or delays. That’s the luxury and efficiency of a seamless airport journey. From the moment you arrive until you step onto the plane, every step can be effortless with the right planning and service choices.

# 1. Effortless Arrival

Your smooth journey begins the moment you arrive at the airport. Instead of circling parking lots searching for a space, you can simply pull up near the terminal. A professional valet takes care of your vehicle, ensuring it’s parked securely while you proceed with your check-in. This time-saving step removes one of the most stressful parts of air travel—finding a parking spot.

# 2. Quick Check-In and Security

Once your car is in safe hands, you can head directly to the check-in counters or security checkpoints. With fewer delays and less time wasted in queues, you can use your extra minutes to relax, grab a coffee, or browse duty-free shops. Travelers who plan ahead often enjoy a far calmer pre-flight experience.

# 3. Comfort and Convenience

A smooth airport experience is about more than just time—it’s about comfort. VIP-style parking and assistance services are designed for maximum convenience. You don’t need to drag heavy luggage across long distances or wait for buses in bad weather. Every detail is taken care of so that your focus remains on your journey, not the logistics.

# 4. Peace of Mind for Your Vehicle

While you’re away, your car stays in a secure, monitored area, often under 24-hour surveillance. Many premium airport services even offer cleaning or maintenance while you travel, so your car looks and feels refreshed upon your return.

**Meet and Greet Heathrow** services represent the gold standard for travelers seeking an efficient, stress-free airport experience. By combining safety, reliability, and time efficiency, these services redefine how modern travelers move through the airport. Whether you’re heading on a business trip or a family holiday, choosing a meet-and-greet-style service ensures your journey from car door to boarding gate is smooth, elegant, and completely hassle-free. It’s the perfect start—and finish—to any flight.",1,1761135149.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

They had a huge selection of SF as shown in the video. 
I wanted to buy her one, so I got Albert for her. I picked Albert because he's small and can fit in her purse. 
I left without buying any more, I just wanted to buy one for my sister. I told my husband about it and he asked which family was my favorite that I saw, and I told him the Marshmallow Mouse family. He made an online order for pickup, and told me to go back and grab it after lunch. 
I met up with my sister & I gave her Albert, she thought he was really cute. She didn't know about SF/CC. I just said ""I collect them and wanted you to have one too"", which she appreciated. We had lunch, and then she wanted to grab a coffee afterwards. I was like ... You know who has coffee? Barnes and Nobles. I have to go back there and grab my marshmallow mouse family anyway. 
So we end up back at Barnes and Noble & grabbed our coffees.

1od6f8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1od6f8q/best_travel_backpack_with_laptop_compartment_and/,Best Travel Backpack With Laptop Compartment And Usb Port,"I'll be honest—when I first saw a backpack with a USB port, I thought it was the dumbest gimmick ever.

Like, why would I pay extra for a port on the *outside* of my bag when my power bank already has ports? It seemed like something designed by marketing people who'd never actually traveled with electronics.

Then I spent eight hours in Istanbul's airport during a layover, desperately trying to reach my power bank buried under three days of dirty laundry while my phone was at 2%. That's when it clicked. This wasn't about the technology—it was about not having to excavate your entire bag every time you needed a charge.

Fast forward two years and probably 30 countries later, and I've tested more USB backpacks than I care to admit. Some were genuinely game-changing. Others? Cheap pieces of junk that failed within a month.

Here's everything I wish someone had told me before I bought my first one.

# First Things First: How Do These Things Actually Work?

This is crucial because the #1 complaint I see is people feeling ""scammed"" after buying a USB backpack. So let's clear this up immediately:

**The backpack does NOT charge itself. It is not magic. You still need to buy a power bank.**

What you're getting is basically a passthrough system. Here's how it works:

1. You put your power bank inside a dedicated pocket in the backpack
2. You connect the power bank to a built-in USB cable inside the bag
3. That internal cable routes to an external USB port on the outside of the backpack
4. You plug your phone into that external port

That's it. The backpack is essentially giving you convenient access to your power bank without opening the main compartment.

Is this revolutionary? No. Is it convenient when you're navigating a crowded train station with one hand holding coffee and the other scrolling maps? Absolutely.

# What to Actually Look For (The Stuff That Matters)

After trying backpacks ranging from $25 to $180, here's what separates the good from the garbage:

# The Laptop Compartment

Your laptop compartment should be:

* **Padded on all sides**, not just the back panel
* **Easily accessible** without unpacking everything else
* **The right size** for your laptop (15.6"" is standard, but measure your actual device)
* **Positioned against your back** for weight distribution, not flopping around

I learned this the hard way when my 15.6"" laptop technically ""fit"" in a backpack but the corners were stretching the zipper to its absolute limit. Not fun when you're worried about your $1,200 MacBook.

# The USB Port Situation

Here's where it gets interesting:

**USB-A vs USB-C:** Most backpacks still only have USB-A ports. This is frustrating in 2025 when many phones and devices use USB-C. A few brands (Fenruien, Travelpro) offer both, which is worth the extra cost if you have newer devices.

**Port placement matters.** I've used bags where the USB port was on the bottom of the side pocket, facing down. Great for rain protection. Terrible when you're trying to plug something in while the bag is on your back.

Look for ports on the upper side or shoulder strap area—much easier to access while wearing the bag.

# Water Resistance (Not Waterproof)

Most backpacks claim to be ""water-resistant."" This typically means:

* Light rain for 15-20 minutes? Probably fine.
* Caught in a downpour for an hour? Your laptop's taking a bath.

True waterproof backpacks exist but they're usually bulkier and more expensive. For most travel, water-resistant is enough—just throw a rain cover in your bag for emergencies.

# Organization vs. Chaos

The sweet spot is 3-5 main compartments. More than that and you'll spend ten minutes looking for your charger. Fewer and everything becomes a jumbled mess.

Essential pockets:

* Laptop compartment (obviously)
* Quick-access front pocket for passport, boarding pass, snacks
* Side pockets for water bottle
* Secret back pocket for valuables (positioned against your back so pickpockets can't reach it)

# The Best Travel Backpacks With Laptop Compartments & USB Ports

I've organized these by who they're actually best for, not just arbitrary rankings. Because the ""best"" backpack for a digital nomad working from cafes is completely different from the best for a college student rushing between classes.

# For Budget-Conscious Travelers: Matein Travel Backpack

**Price:** $28-35  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 15.6""  
**Why everyone recommends it:** Because at this price point, it's shockingly good.

I was skeptical when I saw 50,000+ reviews on Amazon. Surely these were fake, right? Then I actually used one for three months across Southeast Asia.

The Matein packs an absurd amount of organization into a $30 bag. You get a proper laptop compartment, a USB port that actually works, water-resistant material that survived unexpected monsoon rains in Vietnam, and enough pockets that I stopped losing my AirPods every five minutes.

**The catch:** It's not going to last five years. The zippers are serviceable but not indestructible. The shoulder straps are comfortable for day trips but get uncomfortable after 3-4 hours of heavy load. But for the price? It's hard to complain.

**Best for:** Budget travelers, students, anyone wanting to test if they actually use the USB feature before investing more.

# For Daily Commuters: Level8 Condor Laptop Backpack

**Price:** $65-75  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 15.6""  
**Why it's different:** TSA-friendly lay-flat design

If you fly frequently or just hate digging through your bag at security, the lay-flat laptop compartment is a game-changer. Unzip it completely and your laptop lays flat for screening without removing it from the bag.

The USB port placement is one of the best I've used—high on the side panel, easily accessible whether you're wearing the bag or it's on the ground. The 26.5L capacity hits that perfect middle ground: big enough for a change of clothes and gym stuff, small enough that it doesn't feel bulky on the subway.

I used this as my daily carry for a year while doing a business travel stint, and the ergonomic back panel made a huge difference. The airflow design actually works—no more sweat-soaked back after a summer commute.

**One downside:** The exterior fabric shows dirt and scuffs pretty easily if you're hard on your bags.

**Best for:** Business travelers, daily commuters who value comfort, people tired of removing their laptop at every security checkpoint.

# For The Organization Obsessed: North Face Recon

**Price:** $95-110  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 15""  
**Why it stands out:** 30L capacity that somehow still stands upright

Here's something I didn't expect to care about: a backpack that stands up on its own. But after years of watching my bags tip over and spill everything? It matters.

The Recon has a semi-rigid back panel and smart weight distribution that keeps it upright even when it's not totally full. The organization system is thoughtful without being overwhelming—everything has a logical place without requiring a PhD to pack it.

Note that it doesn't have a built-in USB port, but the laptop compartment is exceptional (fully padded, separate from the main compartment), and the durability is on another level. This is a buy-it-once-cry-once situation.

**Best for:** Long-term travelers, people who are hard on their gear, anyone who wants a backpack that'll last 5+ years.

# For Digital Nomads: Solgaard Lifepack Lite

**Price:** $120-140  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 15""  
**Why remote workers love it:** Separate ""Work"" and ""Life"" compartments

The clever bit here is how it's organized. Front ""Life"" compartment for sunglasses, snacks, headphones—stuff you grab constantly. Rear ""Work"" compartment with a floating laptop sleeve (drop-proof design), tablet pocket, and cable organization.

The USB port is tucked into a side pocket to protect it from the elements. Not the most accessible placement, but I appreciated this during beach work sessions where sand was everywhere.

What makes this worth the premium? The build quality. After 18 months of daily use across three continents, mine still looks almost new. The zippers are smooth, the fabric hasn't frayed, and the shoulder straps haven't lost their padding.

**The compromise:** At 25L, it's on the smaller side. Fine for day trips and cafe working, but you won't fit three days of clothes in here.

**Best for:** Digital nomads, remote workers, coffee shop laptop warriors.

# For Expanded Versatility: Fenruien Business Travel Backpack

**Price:** $70-85  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 15.6""  
**The standout feature:** BOTH USB-A and USB-C charging ports

Finally, a backpack that acknowledges not all of us are still using micro-USB. Having both port types means you can charge multiple devices simultaneously or not carry adapters for your newer USB-C devices.

The 26L-38L expandable design is genius for weekend trips. Normal commute? Keep it compressed at 26L. Overnight trip? Expand it to 38L and fit a weekend's worth of clothes without needing a separate bag.

The water-resistant PU coating has held up well through airport rain and accidental coffee spills (don't ask).

**One quirk:** The expansion zipper is a bit stiff. You'll figure it out, but it's not as smooth as I'd like.

**Best for:** Tech enthusiasts with USB-C devices, travelers who want one bag for both daily use and short trips.

# For Maximum Capacity: SHRRADOO Extra Large 50L

**Price:** $45-55  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 17""  
**When you need it:** One-bag travel, long trips, hiking

Look, this thing is huge. I mean truly massive. At 50L, it's approaching the limit of what airlines will let you carry on. But if you're trying to one-bag it for a two-week trip? This can actually work.

The separate shoe compartment at the bottom is brilliant for keeping your dirty hiking boots away from your laptop. The USB port is basic but functional. And somehow, despite the size, the back panel ventilation keeps you from overheating.

**Major caveat:** It does stick out a bit from under airplane seats. Not a dealbreaker, but I've had flight attendants ask me to adjust it a few times.

**Best for:** Long-term travelers, one-bag minimalists, people who need to carry a lot of stuff.

# For Premium Quality: Timbuk2 Authority Deluxe

**Price:** $130-160  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 17""  
**What you're paying for:** Build quality and thoughtful details

No USB port on this one, but the laptop protection is exceptional—we're talking a dedicated padded compartment at the back PLUS a second sleeve in the main compartment for a second laptop or tablet.

The luggage passthrough sleeve, removable sternum straps, and bottom compression straps show this was designed by people who actually travel. Everything is where it should be.

I tested this on a brutal three-month trip where I lived out of this bag, and it didn't even blink. The fabric beads water beautifully, and the bottom panel is fully waterproof, which saved me when I set it down in a puddle at a train station.

**Worth it?** If you're carrying expensive electronics and travel frequently, yes. If you're a casual user, probably overkill.

**Best for:** Frequent business travelers, photographers with expensive gear, people who view luggage as an investment.

# Common Problems (And How to Avoid Them)

# ""My USB port doesn't work!""

90% of the time, this is one of three issues:

1. **You forgot to buy a power bank.** (Seriously, this is THE most common complaint.)
2. **The internal cable isn't connected properly.** Check that it's fully plugged into your power bank—sometimes it comes loose.
3. **Your power bank is dead.** Obvious, but you'd be surprised how often this is the culprit.

The other 10%? Cheap cables. If you bought a $20 backpack, the internal cable quality might be questionable. Look for backpacks from reputable brands with good reviews specifically mentioning the USB functionality.

# Airport Security Drama

TSA rules are clear: your power bank must be removable from your bag and have its capacity clearly marked on the device. Most travel backpacks are designed with this in mind (dedicated, easy-access power bank pocket).

I've been through security in 30+ countries with USB backpacks and been stopped exactly once—because my power bank didn't have the capacity labeled. Lesson learned: mark it with a Sharpie if needed.

China is particularly strict about power bank capacity (10,000mAh limit in many regions), so research your destination's rules.

# It's Slower Than Direct Charging

Yes, there can be some power loss through the passthrough system. You're adding an extra connection point, which always introduces some inefficiency.

In practice? I've never noticed a meaningful difference. Your phone might charge 5-10% slower, but we're talking minutes, not hours. Unless you're trying to fast-charge while editing 4K video, you won't care.

# Quality Control Is All Over the Map

This is especially true for budget brands. I've seen identical-looking backpacks with wildly different quality depending on where they were manufactured.

Check recent reviews, not just overall ratings. A backpack with 5 stars from 2022 might be garbage now if the manufacturer changed factories. Look for reviews from the last 3-6 months.

# Is a USB Backpack Actually Worth It?

Here's my honest take after using these for years:

**You'll love it if:**

* You frequently use your phone while traveling (maps, music, podcasts)
* You work remotely or commute with electronics daily
* You're tired of fishing for your power bank every time your battery dips
* You appreciate organization and dedicated spots for things

**Skip it if:**

* You rarely use your phone enough to need midday charges
* You're okay with pulling out your power bank when needed
* You're buying it just because it seems ""cool"" but won't actually use the feature
* You refuse to buy a separate power bank (it's required—the bag doesn't charge itself!)

For me? After initially being skeptical, I'm now a convert. But I travel 100+ days a year and rely heavily on my phone for work. For someone who only travels occasionally and doesn't use their phone much? The regular backpack pocket works fine.

# What About USB-C?

This is where the market is frustratingly behind. Most backpacks still only offer USB-A ports, even though many phones, tablets, and even some laptops have moved to USB-C.

Your options:

1. **Get a dual-port backpack** (Fenruien and Travelpro offer both USB-A and USB-C)
2. **Use an adapter** (adds another potential failure point, but works)
3. **Accept that you'll use a USB-A to USB-C cable** from the port to your device

I expect this to change over the next couple years as USB-C becomes standard, but for now, it's something to consider based on your devices.

# The Power Bank You'll Actually Need

Since the backpack doesn't include one (worth repeating), here's what to look for:

**Capacity:** 10,000mAh is the sweet spot for most travelers. It'll charge most phones 2-3 times and still fits airline regulations worldwide. Going bigger means more weight and potential airport hassles.

**Brand matters:** Anker, RAVPower, and Aukey are reliable. I've had sketchy no-name brands swell up or just die randomly—not worth the $10 savings when it might damage your bag or phone.

**Check your backpack's power bank pocket size** before buying a huge 20,000mAh brick that won't fit.

# Final Thoughts: My Current Setup

After testing all of these, my current daily carry is the Level8 Condor for commuting and the Solgaard Lifepack Lite for travel. Both have lasted over a year with heavy use, the USB ports still work perfectly, and they've held up to the abuse of constant travel.

For budget-conscious folks, the Matein is legitimately good. It's not going to last forever, but at that price point, it doesn't need to.

The most important thing? Be realistic about whether you'll actually use the USB feature. If you're buying it just because it seems neat, save your money. But if you're constantly pulling out your phone throughout the day, having easy access to charging without digging through your bag genuinely makes travel less stressful.

And remember: **you still need to buy a power bank separately.** I can't emphasize this enough based on the number of confused reviews I've seen.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need a power bank?**  
YES. The backpack does not generate electricity. It's a passthrough system that connects your power bank to an external port.

**Will this work with my iPhone/Android?**  
Yes, as long as you have the right cable to connect to your phone. The backpack just provides access to your power bank's USB port.

**Is it waterproof?**  
Most are water-resistant, not waterproof. They'll handle light rain but not submersion. Consider a rain cover for heavy downpours.

**Can I bring this on a plane?**  
Yes, but your power bank must be removable and have its capacity clearly marked. Generally, under 100Wh (around 27,000mAh at 3.7V) is allowed, but check your airline's specific rules.

**How long will the USB port last?**  
This varies wildly by quality. Budget backpacks might see the port fail within 6-12 months of heavy use. Premium brands can last years. Check recent reviews for quality control issues.

**Can I charge a laptop through the USB port?**  
Not at useful speeds. Most USB-A ports provide 5V/2A (10W), which might keep your laptop from dying but won't actually charge it while in use. USB-C ports with power delivery can sometimes work, but don't count on it.

**What if the USB port breaks?**  
In most cases, it's just the internal cable that failed. Many backpacks allow you to replace this cable. Otherwise, you still have a functional laptop backpack—you just can't use the external charging port anymore.

Prepared: 2025-10-21



Executive summary

This report summarizes a content and community analysis of r/KingstonOntario based on the most recent posts visible on the subreddit front page at the time of access. The community is a small-to-midsize, locally focused forum where residents, visitors, and local businesses share recommendations, local news, photos, small acts of kindness, and practical requests (housing, jobs, services). The tone is friendly, practical, and civic‑minded.

Primary takeaways: - High volume of location‑specific requests (housing, jobs, recommendations) and event announcements.- Frequent positive, neighbourly posts (thank‑you notes, small goodwill moments, photos).- Local businesses and civic issues appear regularly and elicit pragmatic discussion.- Community values: helpfulness, local engagement, low-tolerance for off-topic/advertising content.



Methodology

Snapshot scraping: reviewed the subreddit front page and community highlights as presented on the subreddit at the time of access. The dataset consisted of the most recent posts visible on the front page (roughly \~40 posts and highlights).

Hand-coded thematic tagging: each visible post was read and assigned one or more topical tags (e.g., housing, event, photo, business, request, gratitude, safety/incident).

Qualitative synthesis: derived community tone, values, and an “average user” persona from post content, language, and inferred user intent.

Limitations: - I used a public snapshot of the subreddit front page. I did not access private message data or user profiles.- The sample is a convenience sample (front page snapshot) rather than a systematic sample of the subreddit’s entire history.- Exact numeric metrics (e.g., user ages, gender, precise post counts over long time periods) are not available from the public page and were therefore inferred from content.



Quantitative snapshot (approximate frequencies from snapshot)

These percentages are approximate, drawn from the topical tagging of the snapshot posts.

Local requests & classifieds (housing, jobs, services): \~28%

Events & meetups (including community Discord, Nerd Night): \~18%

Photos & local scenes (waterfront, Snowbirds, cookies): \~16%

Local business / civic items (news about restaurants, local policy): \~12%

Thank‑yous / small acts of kindness / community goodwill: \~10%

Safety/incident posts (asking about current local emergency or incident): \~8%

Misc / viral / off‑topic (vlogs, humour): \~8%

Common keywords observed in titles and text: Kingston, downtown, looking, thank you, Snowbirds, Princess St, job, cookies, yoga, AI (local business use)



Qualitative findings

Tone & voice

Generally conversational and neighbourly — posts read like people talking to neighbours rather than broadcasting.

Many posts are short, descriptive, and request‑oriented (“Looking for X”, “Where can I find Y”).

Visual posts (photos of downtown, Snowbirds, waterfront) attract attention and engagement.

Values & motivations

Practical help: residents use the space for quick pragmatic questions (jobs, rental leads, service recommendations).

Local pride and place attachment—users share images and local events and respond with friendly comments.

Civic curiosity—users post about local incidents and business practices and expect community input.

Community norms

Local relevance is expected; the community highlights and pinned resources emphasize city focus.

Low tolerance for aggressive advertising or off-topic content—posts are typically allowed if they serve local members (events, jobs, services).



Average user persona (composite)

Name: “Local Kingston User”

Age range: 20s–40s (composite; includes students and mid‑career residents)Residency: Lives in Kingston or surrounding area, or is moving/visiting and wants local insight.Occupation & lifestyle: Mix of students (Queen’s University), service sector employees, small business owners, and public sector/local government workers.Goals on the subreddit: Find recommendations, post classifieds, share or view local photos and events, check quick local updates.Tone: Practical, friendly, civic‑minded; prefers concise requests or helpful answers.



Representative post examples (from snapshot)

Job and business discussion: discussion of a restaurant applying for a temporary foreign worker (LMIA) for a manager position.

Local goodwill: short, appreciative posts about daily interactions (“Thank you, kind stranger”).

Event/community: Nerd Night / D&D meetups and Discord reminders.

Local scene: photos of Snowbirds over downtown and waterfront shots.

Practical request: requests for yoga studio recommendations and driving job leads.



Recommendations

For community managers / moderators

Keep a clear pinned post for common classifieds (housing, jobs, services) to reduce repetition.

Maintain and promote a single events calendar or Discord link for meetups (already present as a highlight).

Enforce a minimum standard for business posts — require local relevance and non‑spammy behaviour (e.g., one announcement + AMA or community engagement).

Consider a weekly megathread for housing and classified listings.

For someone wanting to engage the community (local business or organizer)

Use short, local‑first posts: title with the neighbourhood or landmark (e.g., “Downtown Kingston — volunteer cleanup this Sat”).

Visual content performs well — share a clear photo of the location or event.

Avoid overt marketing language; frame posts as service to the community (e.g., discounted service for locals, donation drives).

Offer something actionable: RSVP link in comments (not in title), short FAQ in the post body.

Content ideas that typically get traction

High-quality photos of Kingston landmarks or events.

Short neighbourhood guides (“Best coffee near Queen’s campus under $5”).

Hyperlocal Q&A (“Is there a reliable landlord in the 200 block of X?”).

Local history or nostalgia posts (Kingston’s heritage/forts are popular).



Next steps & optional extensions (if you want deeper work)

Programmatic scrape of the subreddit (last 6–12 months) to produce exact topic distribution, top posters, engagement rates, and sentiment analysis.

Keyword frequency analysis and time-of-day posting heatmap.

Audience segmentation (regular posters vs lurkers vs visitors) using comment/post frequency.



Appendix: data snapshot & notes

Source: front page / community highlights of r/KingstonOntario (publicly visible posts).

Images and community highlights were used to infer visual content preferences (waterfront photos, City Hall, Snowbirds).

Thesis writing is causing literal brain mush. I need 3 hour focus blocks but nothing sticks. I've tried nearly everything in this subreddit, open to more suggestions though. Pomodoro technique works for some people but for me it just breaks my flow constantly. Website blockers help a bit but then I just end up staring at a blank document. Coffee makes me jittery after the second cup I’ll sometimes do decaf but that’s just placebo, and tea isn’t too bad besides having to constantly get up to use the restroom. Study music is hit or miss depending on the day, I’ve been using 20 Hz binaural beats. I’ve tried a ton of nootropic energy drinks too and the l-theanine helps I guess but it’s the same as coffee realistically.

So my life now revolves around testing different approaches to see what actually moves the needle. Pure caffeine route makes me anxious and I'll crash hard before hitting the 2 hour mark. Changed my study environment, tried standing desk, different lighting, all that stuff. It helps marginally but isn’t sustainable long term as I’ll need to grind wherever I am. I’ve tried various supplements too, l-theanine, magnesium, alpha GPC, B complex, huperzine A. I also sometimes use neurogum or just chew gum in general.  Also no judgement but I have definitely tried nic pouches and the new ultra nootropic pouches but they either didn't do much or made me more stimulated than coffee to the point where I couldn’t focus.

My friends are quite tapped into this kind of stuff so I’ve started doing cold shows in the morning after one told me he swears by it after his runs. This is for sure the best change to my routine so far, literally natural endorphins that last until the early afternoon at least, sometimes the entire day.  Another friend only drinks mate which seems to work for her and I’ve tried it it’s much better than coffee/tea, I’ll probably stick with that. Another buddy in my seminar is always chewing this natural nootropic gum called bizz, it’s definitely better than all the pouches I’ve used and isn’t too stimulating so I’ve started using it in the afternoons in place of coffee/mate.

Finally combining a few of these things has helped work wonders.  I’ll also do short walks between research/writing sessions without my phone, I guess this is similar to pomodoro. Plus the cold showers, mate and gum, now I've been hitting 3 to 4 hour blocks more consistently. Still not perfect and some days are definitely better than others but it's way better than where I was before. I think the key is finding a mix of things that work together rather than looking for one magic solution.

I am **not** looking for a strip-and-refinish. What I need is someone who can:

* clean the existing finish and remove surface grime without disturbing the paper underneath
* stabilize any areas where the original coating has worn through
* do careful touch-ups where needed
* fill a couple patches where tickets completely peeled off with either replacement tickets/new paper tags or maybe engraved brass 'patches'
* strip and polish the metal footings
* apply a durable clear protective topcoat so it can function as a (better taken care of) coffee table again

It needs a conservation-minded approach treating the ticket surface as something to restore, enhance and preserve. My research so far has come up with these local shops:

* Furniture Restoration Solutions in Mason
* John Furniture Restoration in Holt
* Interior Accents Upholstering & Antique Furniture in Lansing
* Furniture Doctor in Williamston

The front door was locked and she took her cell phone so I know she wasn't confused. A buddy of mine and me when I texted him thought she might have thought it was time for her doctors appt, so he told me to drive looking for her. I did and low and behold she was playing cell phone games in the parking lot at her doctor's. It's spine doctors appt. She told me she then thought it was 6am so she was playing games waiting for the doctors to open, so she started playing games she said to wait till 7am.  She was very coherent just a little woozy but I asked if she was ok to drive back home and she said yes confidently. I followed her home ( I was gonna drive her and leave my car there). She knew she messed up when I told her it was night when I got to where she was so I figured she was ok to drive.  She had told me she did her morning routine, but did not take her morning meds which were just vitamins cuz she thought she was running late. 

TLDR... Basically when she woke up at night thought it was morning, drove to her doctor's after getting ready. Then I found her there alert and coherent. ",1,1761134024.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

1od5vi1,https://v.redd.it/7i3kl123hnwf1,A glimpse of my first solo travel journey to Kasol,"Somewhere between the Parvati Valley trails and the sound of the river, I found a version of myself I actually liked.
My first solo journey — Kasol, you’ll always be special. 🏔️

I have used ChatGPT for a proper construction for my trip . 
Day 1: Arrival & Exploring the Heart of Kasol
	•	Stay: Zostel Katagla 🏡
Reached Kasol and checked into Zostel Katagla — tucked right beside the Parvati River with mountain views that instantly hit the reset button.
	•	Exploration:
	•	Took a walk through Katagla village and soaked in the peaceful vibe.
	•	Headed to Kasol Market — tried local snacks, browsed handmade jewelry, and picked up a few souvenirs.
	•	Paid a visit to Manikaran Sahib Gurudwara, experienced the hot springs and the serene spiritual atmosphere.
	•	Evening:
	•	Went for an evening run in the cold mountain air, along the river path. Nothing beats that feeling — crisp air, soft drizzle, and a mind finally quiet.

⸻

Day 2: Banjara Waterfalls Trek
	•	After a lazy breakfast at Zostel, I set out for the Banjara Waterfalls trek.
	•	The trail was short but scenic — lush greenery, small wooden bridges, and the soothing sound of water echoing through the valley.
	•	Spent some time at the falls just taking it all in — a perfect balance of peace and adrenaline.
	•	Evening back in Kasol: grabbed dinner at a local café and chilled by the bonfire at Zostel with other travelers.

⸻

Day 3: Road Trip to Pulga, Kalga & Tosh
	•	Route: Kasol → Pulga → Kalga → Tosh (by car) 🚗
	•	The drive itself was an experience — winding roads, pine forests, and stunning views of the Parvati Valley at every turn.
	•	Explored the quiet villages of Pulga and Kalga, met a few locals, and enjoyed chai with mountain views.
	•	Reached Tosh by evening — explored iconic cafés like:
	•	Panjtara Café ☕
	•	Offlimits Café 🎶
	•	Pinki Didi’s Last Resort Café 🍛 (a must-visit for its warmth and food)
	•	Ended the day with sunset views over the valley and live music vibes around Tosh.

⸻

Day 4: Trek to Kheerganga Begins
	•	Early morning start from Barshaini — the base point for the Kheerganga trek.
	•	The trail was a mix of dense forest, waterfalls, and small cafés tucked into the hills.
	•	Reached Kheerganga top by late afternoon, just in time for the sunset.
	•	Checked into a tent stay and spent the evening around a bonfire under the stars.

⸻

Day 5: Exploring Kheerganga & Hot Springs
	•	Woke up to a misty morning surrounded by snow-capped peaks.
	•	Took a dip in the natural hot springs — truly the highlight of the trek.
	•	Explored the area, interacted with fellow trekkers, and just enjoyed being disconnected from the world.
	•	Another night in the tent, surrounded by silence and starlight.

⸻

Day 6: Descent & Departure
	•	Early morning descent from Kheerganga back to Barshaini.
	•	Wrapped up the trip with one last coffee by the Parvati River before heading back.
	•	Left Kasol with a heart full of peace, a camera full of memories, and a mind already planning the next mountain escape.

1od5pvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1od5pvd/best_vpns_for_new_jersey/,Best VPNs for New Jersey,"New Jersey residents gained significant new privacy rights when the **New Jersey Data Protection Act (NJDPA)** took effect on January 15, 2025. This comprehensive privacy law gives you the right to access, correct, delete, and control how businesses use your personal data.

But here's the catch: **while the NJDPA regulates what businesses do with your data, it doesn't stop your internet service provider from collecting it in the first place.** According to a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report, major ISPs routinely collect extensive consumer data—including browsing history, location information, and behavioral patterns—and share it with third parties through arrangements often buried in privacy policy fine print.

For New Jersey residents served by providers like Verizon Fios, Xfinity, and Optimum, a VPN adds a crucial technical layer of protection that complements your new legal rights under the NJDPA. This guide examines the best VPN services specifically for users in the Garden State.

# Why New Jersey Residents Need a VPN

# The NJDPA Gives You Rights—But Not Complete Protection

The NJDPA applies to companies handling data from at least 100,000 New Jersey residents, granting you rights to:

* Confirm whether your data is being processed
* Access and obtain copies of your personal data
* Correct inaccuracies in your information
* Delete your personal data
* Opt out of targeted advertising and data sales

**However, this law doesn't prevent initial data collection.** Your ISP still sees every website you visit, every search you make, and can build detailed profiles of your online behavior. The NJDPA gives you tools to control that data after collection—a VPN prevents much of that collection from happening at all.

# ISP Data Collection in New Jersey

New Jersey's major internet providers serve over 98% of households in the state with high-speed connections. But this connectivity comes with significant privacy trade-offs:

* **Verizon Fios** covers extensive areas across New Jersey with fiber-optic service
* **Xfinity** provides cable internet to the majority of the state
* **Optimum** serves many communities with both cable and fiber options

According to the FTC's findings, ISPs collect data far beyond what's necessary for business operations, creating privacy risks from potential exploitation by data brokers, property managers, and other third parties. Without encryption, your ISP can see:

* Every website you visit
* Every search query you enter
* Your location and usage patterns
* Unencrypted data transmitted across their network

# New Jersey's Geographic Advantage

Living in New Jersey offers a unique advantage for VPN users: **proximity to major server hubs in New York City**. The closer you are to a VPN server, the faster your connection speed. With NYC just across the river, New Jersey residents can achieve near-local speeds while maintaining robust encryption.

This geographic benefit means you can enjoy the security advantages of a VPN with minimal performance impact—often retaining 90-95% of your baseline internet speed.

# Top 5 VPNs for New Jersey Users

# 1. NordVPN - Best Overall for New Jersey

**NordVPN** emerges as the top choice for New Jersey residents based on a combination of speed, server proximity, and comprehensive security features.

# Key Features to Look For

When selecting a VPN in New Jersey, prioritize these critical features:

# Server Proximity

**Look for VPN providers with servers in New York City or the tri-state area.** Physical distance to the server directly impacts connection speed. NordVPN's extensive NYC infrastructure provides optimal performance for New Jersey users.

# No-Logs Policy

**Verify independent audits of privacy claims.** Reputable providers like NordVPN undergo regular third-party audits to confirm they don't store user activity data. This is crucial for actual privacy protection.

# Strong Encryption Standards

**AES-256 encryption** is the industry standard. All recommended VPNs use military-grade encryption to protect your data from interception.

# Kill Switch Functionality

**Automatic protection if your VPN disconnects.** This prevents accidental data leaks if your VPN connection drops temporarily.

# Modern Protocols

**WireGuard-based protocols** (like NordVPN's NordLynx) offer the best combination of speed and security in 2025. They outperform older protocols like OpenVPN in speed while maintaining strong security.

# Common Use Cases for NJ VPN Users

# Protecting Privacy from ISPs

Use a VPN on all your devices to encrypt traffic before it reaches Verizon, Xfinity, or Optimum. This prevents ISP-level tracking and profiling, complementing your NJDPA rights.

# Accessing Regional Content

Connect to servers in different locations to access geo-restricted streaming content or regional sports broadcasts. This is particularly useful for New Jersey residents traveling outside the region.

# Securing Public WiFi

**Never use public WiFi without a VPN.** Coffee shops, airports, and hotels in Newark, Jersey City, and throughout New Jersey offer convenient connectivity but often lack proper security. A VPN encrypts your connection even on unsecured networks.

# Remote Work Security

Protect sensitive work data when working remotely. Many New Jersey professionals commute to NYC or work from home—a VPN adds an essential security layer for business communications.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Is using a VPN legal in New Jersey?** Yes, VPNs are completely legal in New Jersey and throughout the United States. The FBI even recommends using VPNs to protect your privacy. However, using a VPN doesn't make illegal activities legal.

**Will a VPN slow down my Verizon Fios or Xfinity connection?** Premium VPNs like NordVPN typically reduce speeds by only 5-10% when connecting to nearby servers. With NJ's proximity to NYC servers, the impact is minimal. In 2025 testing, NordVPN retained over 95% of baseline speed on local connections.

**Do I still need to exercise my NJDPA rights if I use a VPN?** Yes. A VPN prevents data collection during transmission, while NJDPA rights help you control data already collected. Use both approaches together for comprehensive protection.

**Can my ISP tell I'm using a VPN?** Your ISP can see that you're using a VPN but cannot see what you're doing through it. All they observe is encrypted traffic to a VPN server—not the websites you visit or data you transmit.

**Are free VPNs safe for New Jersey users?** No. Free VPNs often make money by selling user data to advertisers—defeating the purpose of using a VPN. Many also inject ads, limit bandwidth, and provide weak security. Invest in a reputable paid service with verified no-logs policies.

# The Bottom Line for New Jersey Residents

**NordVPN** stands out as the best VPN for New Jersey users due to its unbeatable combination of proximity (1,970+ US servers including NYC), speed (950+ Mbps in 2025 testing), and comprehensive security features. The recent NJDPA gives you important legal rights, but a VPN provides the technical protection needed to prevent data collection at the source.

For New Jersey residents serious about online privacy, NordVPN's geographic advantages, proven security, and competitive pricing at $2.99/month make it the clear choice. With a 30-day money-back guarantee, you can test the service risk-free.

**Surfshark** offers an excellent budget alternative for families, while **ExpressVPN** suits users prioritizing simplicity over cost savings. Whatever your choice, using a VPN in 2025 is no longer optional—it's a necessary tool for protecting your digital privacy in the Garden State.

1od5pqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1od5pqb/and_then_there_wasnt/,And Then There Wasn’t,"I saw a flower shop today.  
They had lilies; so fresh, so alive...  
I almost rushed to get them,  
but paused.  
I remembered… for whom?

Walking down the street,  
I saw someone with her shoelace untied.  
I bent, almost instinctively,  
ready to lift her foot to my knee,  
tie it the way I used to for you;  
then stopped.  
It wasn’t you.

In a crowded lane the other day,  
I stretched my hand out,  
searching for your fingers,  
hoping to feel that quiet squeeze you gave  
whenever I got lost,  
but there was only air.

Last weekend, I went on a hike.  
I was racing someone,  
or maybe the wind,  
and when I stopped to look back,  
waiting for you to catch up,  
I remembered...  
I was the only one there.

At the bookstore near my house,  
a new novel sat on the front rack.  
I thought of buying it,  
but there was no one to gift it to.

I found a new café,  
its coffee worse than our usual one,  
but I sat there anyway,  
facing an empty chair,  
pretending you were late again.

This morning, I made breakfast.  
The egg somehow tasted better;  
lighter, softer...  
but I couldn’t tell if it was the recipe  
or just the silence.

The other day, I was cooking maggie.  
I took out a spoonful for you to taste,  
like I always did;  
then remembered,  
I was the only one in the house.

This Tihar, the sky was shimmering;  
lights, fireworks, laughter everywhere,  
and I turned to see  
how the glow looked in your eyes.  
But there were no eyes.  
Just me, and the reflection of being alone again.

And now, the silence,  
as there’s no one left to yap,  
no one to convince,  
because no one’s upset  
or making faces anymore.

No more *“Have you reached home?”*  
No more leaving office early  
just to see you.

No more *“Look, I got a new dress!”*  
oh wait, I also got myself  
a new pair of suits.

No more buying groceries with someone.  
No more earrings hunt.  
No more remembering birthdays,  
or all those other dates (including periods 😅).

No more remembering to pick  
your favourite chocolate  
while I stand in the aisle of chocolates.

There was you,  
and then there wasn’t.  
And somehow,  
everything still remembers you;  
except time.",4,1761132714.0,NepalSocial,11,1.0,False

They had lilies; so fresh, so alive...  
I almost rushed to get them,  
but paused.  
I remembered… for whom?

Walking down the street,  
I saw someone with her shoelace untied.  
I bent, almost instinctively,  
ready to lift her foot to my knee,  
tie it the way I used to for you;  
then stopped.  
It wasn’t you.

In a crowded lane the other day,  
I stretched my hand out,  
searching for your fingers,  
hoping to feel that quiet squeeze you gave  
whenever I got lost,  
but there was only air.

Last weekend, I went on a hike.  
I was racing someone,  
or maybe the wind,  
and when I stopped to look back,  
waiting for you to catch up,  
I remembered...  
I was the only one there.

At the bookstore near my house,  
a new novel sat on the front rack.  
I thought of buying it,  
but there was no one to gift it to.

I found a new café,  
its coffee worse than our usual one,  
but I sat there anyway,  
facing an empty chair,  
pretending you were late again.

This morning, I made breakfast.  
The egg somehow tasted better;  
lighter, softer...  
but I couldn’t tell if it was the recipe  
or just the silence.

The other day, I was cooking maggie.  
I took out a spoonful for you to taste,  
like I always did;  
then remembered,  
I was the only one in the house.

This Tihar, the sky was shimmering;  
lights, fireworks, laughter everywhere,  
and I turned to see  
how the glow looked in your eyes.  
But there were no eyes.  
Just me, and the reflection of being alone again.

And now, the silence,  
as there’s no one left to yap,  
no one to convince,  
because no one’s upset  
or making faces anymore.

No more *“Have you reached home?”*  
No more leaving office early  
just to see you.

No more *“Look, I got a new dress!”*   
oh wait, I also got myself  
a new pair of suits.

No more buying groceries with someone.  
No more earrings hunt.  
No more remembering birthdays,  
or all those other dates (including periods 😅).

No more remembering to pick  
your favourite chocolate  
while I stand in the aisle of chocolates.

There was you,  
and then there wasn’t.  
And somehow,  
everything still remembers you;  
except time.",1,1761132603.0,NepalWrites,0,1.0,False

First off- 26F, 150lb 5'10"" new to fasting & my goal with it is primarily to balance ghrelin & leptin (ex-binger here) and increase insulin sensitivity. A bonus would be to eventually lean out a bit but I'm in no rush.

Because of anxiety, insomnia and most recently (since 2022) drastic hair loss(thyroid & blood status normal), I've decided to quit caffeine for a minimum of six months to see if I can see any improvement.
This decision has been surprisingly hard, I really struggle to envision not having my morning cup, or my ""getting started on work""-cup. 

In the midst of the dread I realized that this is an opportunity to finally try clean fasting for the first time. I've done 30 hours and omad a bunch of times but never gone without coffee with glycine and a splash of milk in the mornings. I think getting out of the coffee habit is a perfect time to focus on upping my fasting game. I'm actually excited to see if I will feel any different, even during shorter intermittent fasts, and muster up the courage to do a 36h soon.

Today is my fifth day off caffeine and I am past the headaches. These last days I've done pretty much 18:6-21:3 in terms of intermittent fasting.

What are you guys' experiences with clean vs dirty fasting? Feel any different? How about on vs off caffeine?

Have you noticed any effect on your body composition when quitting or starting to use caffeine in your fasting?

TLDR; do you notice any difference in how you feel while fasting on vs off caffeine? 
Also, do you feel different when clean fasting vs dirty fasting?

Dai and I got home yesterday evening. We are happy to be home! A 90-min drive took about 3 hours because by now I have learned the Three Golden Rules of the Road for children: take frequent breaks, research playgrounds ahead of the trip, and stop at Mickey D’s.

When we visited the second pediatric cardiologist yesterday morning, she confirmed the sudpicion and diagnosis of the first doctor: Dai had no fever at the time of our visit with her, and there was now no sign of a murmur. This explains why all of his well visits recently did not pick up a murmur—he simply did not have a fever at those times. He's right on time with second-year molars appearances. It’s not common but also not unusual that Dai was experiencing no symptoms besides the low-grade fever that got picked up on Monday. “Not to worry,” she told us, “even these fever-derived murmurs tend to disappear with age. His chart is now marked so any doctor will know this in the future.”

A friend from across the hedges took some time on my post yesterday to question why it took a cardiologist (please note, actually a *pediatric* cardiologist) to pick this up. Good question, Pall. Dai was exhibiting no symptoms, so we never checked his mouth or took his temperature. Why would we? That’s why there’s a “pediatric” in front of “pediatric cardiologist.” They study the functioning of children’s hearts and pick up things that other doctors might not.

At any rate, [Building the Foundation of Lasting Peace](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/building-the-foundationof-lasting-peace/) in the October 2 WT is really worth a read. It looks, decade-by-decade, at key guidances Daisaku Ikeda gave on his trips to the United States.

The editors note: “In May 1983, Ikeda Sensei visited Anchorage, Alaska, where the First North America General Meeting was held. Here, he spoke about the importance of the inner-directed revolution of each person to move humanity toward happiness.”

Dr. Ikeda writes:

>“It is true that even though you practice faith, you may suffer from many anxieties and problems both in society and within the SGI organization. But Buddhism expounds the principle of ‘earthly desires are enlightenment.’

>“Here, ‘earthly desires’ include all your sufferings and worries, and point to the inherent destiny of human beings. But with the power of faith in the Mystic Law, you can transform your earthly desires into sources of enlightenment, the supreme condition of happiness. In other words, you can use your anguish and suffering as fuel for polishing your character and establishing indestructible happiness.” 

Thinking back this month to the flare-up in my dissociative disorder, the growth of the school, and all the worrying about Dai’s health, this is a very important thought for me. I am using my anguish and suffering as fuel for polishing my character and establishing indestructible happiness.

All I know right now is that Dai will grow into a healthy young man who has a great mission! Going through all of October’s challenges has sparked my “inner-directed revolution”: to be stronger than the inevitable ups and downs in life and to respect my inner nobility. Now I can direct these realizations into moving “humanity toward happiness.” Hmmm, starting with Coffee Hour, today’s “Costco/Starbucks run, and catching up on paperwork!

Needs within the Church change with the times. Take, for example, the need for theological education: in older days parish priests in Greece did not need to have any formal theological education, nor were there any institutional resources to provide it even if it was needed.  

In those days the people of the local Greek village would choose the most pious man among them and commend him to the bishop when they needed a new priest. The man would leave the village for a few weeks to spend time learning how to serve the services and swing the censer and return home wearing a cassock. He then continued to work on his farm or vineyard as before with the exception that on Sundays and feast days he would don his cassock and serve in the altar as their parish priest. He would not preach or hear confessions for he had neither the theological training nor the pastoral expertise for that. If any of the people wanted confession a monastery was nearby. Moreover, everyone in the village was Orthodox and so there was no need for apologetics or evangelism or in-depth study of the Scriptures. Given the needs of the people and monastic resources nearby, it all worked just fine.

That was then; this is now. Today in our secular and pluralistic society there is a great need for apologetics, evangelism, and in-depth Scripture study. Visitors to churches ask questions, offer objections, and are quite prepared to challenge the faith of the Church if they don’t understand something. Clerical ignorance (let’s call it what it is) is a luxury we can no longer afford. This is especially true now that so many people are “online” and come as inquirers to our churches with many questions regarding our faith— and often, with many misunderstandings based on the strange stuff they have read on websites. They have questions; clergy need to have answers.

In the 1950’s and 1960s this was no problem. The churches were full and many young men offered themselves to be clergy, both in Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Orthodox churches. They would get a degree as a young man (possibly a B.A.) and then enter seminary to study theology, maybe marrying while they were there. Full churches meant full seminaries and large graduating classes. In my 1979 Anglican seminary graduating class there were a couple of dozen young graduates.

Sadly, this is no longer the case. Many men find Orthodoxy after they have married and started families and leaving their jobs to spend three years at a seminary is not a financial option for them. But the need for theological education is still the same and, in fact, even greater. What are they to do?

The Church has, it seems to me, been caught flat-footed and surprised by this development and has been struggling to catch up, offering learning opportunities as best they could. Some were better than others.

I remember my involvement in two of them. I was converting to Orthodoxy from Anglicanism where I had been a priest for six years along with my wife and two very young daughters. The question was: how to get an Orthodox education? One suggestion that I was asked try was a correspondence course, run by very well-intentioned and smart people. Accordingly, I took the correspondence course while I was still an Anglican priest working in an Anglican parish, studying part-time as best I could.

It was, however, entirely inadequate. If memory serves the course in theology consisted of a suggestion that I read the *Great Catechism* of St. Gregory of Nyssa and then write a short paper on some topic. No lectures, no real reading list, no comprehensive exams. This was not, may I say, theological education.

Another learning opportunity rejoiced in the name “The St. Arseny Institute” named for the (uncanonized) Fr. Arseny of Winnipeg. The “Institute” consisted of a dear man in Winnipeg doing his best to persuade parish clergy to give lectures to anyone local who cared to take them. I know this because I was one of the local clergy. (One priest asked me recently, “Weren’t you the only one?”) The “courses” consisted of me meeting at a local restaurant and talking about theology or Bible or church history over coffee for an hour a dozen times or so. I would then report to my Winnipeg friend that said listener had passed the course. There was no required reading list, as I recall, no papers written, and no exams such as you would find at a seminary to see if the required books had been read and lectures understood.

In calling itself a theological education it was, in retrospect, a bit of “smoke and mirrors”. Since the people taking the “St. Arseny course” were planning on being deacons, the lack of knowledge was not a problem. Their job as deacons involved chanting a litany and swinging a censer, not answering questions about whether St. Gregory the Theologian was a universalist like his friend St. Gregory of Nyssa.

There is currently a surge of interest in Orthodoxy in the West and there are many young men now attending our churches. Many of these young men would like to take Holy Orders. This happy development constitutes a challenge because it is combined with the fact that many of us older clergy will soon die—or at least retire from leading parishes. There is currently a clergy shortage and with the influx of new men in our churches the shortage can only get worse.

The question is a pressing one and it presents a challenge— viz. the question of how these young men, many of whom are married with families or at least have jobs that they cannot leave, can receive a theological education. Insisting that they leave their jobs anyway and go to seminary incurring spectacular debt followed by low-paying jobs as mission priests, is not an option.

I suggest the following, at least as a temporary stop-gap. The need is not for men with degrees and letters after their names. The need is for men who know stuff, a lot of stuff, men who know theology, lituriology, Scripture, church history, and who can answer difficult questions. Men who can preach. Men who can work sensitively with Parish Councils and choir directors and women’s groups and the multitude of interesting and varied people who make up our parishes. That is, the need is for knowledge and expertise, not for academic qualifications.

Perhaps dioceses (or jurisdictions) could arrange for a select group of scholarly men to take on a limited number of candidates and teach them by Zoom meetings— say about no more than a dozen candidates per scholar. One scholar might teach theology; another might teach church history; another still might teach Scripture studies. These teachers could assign reading lists, have their candidates write papers, take exams and inter-act with their teachers on a one-on-one basis. This process would allow the candidates to remain at their jobs and support their families, taking as much or little time as needed to complete their training. Face-to-face meetings (perhaps with the entire group) could be arranged periodically as needed and as feasible.

The candidates could also be mentored by their pastors, as older priests train their younger candidates, telling them about where landmines are usually buried in parishes and how to avoid stepping on them. For, as any old priest can tell you, there is more to being a parish priest and a father to a family than simply knowing facts. The priest’s job is not just to transmit information; it is to create family. This requires pastoral experience in the teachers and a true mentoring of those who are taught.

This network of teachers, spread throughout the diocese or jurisdiction, could keep track of the progress of their candidates, both their educational progress and their pastoral and spiritual progress. It would be up to them as teachers as well as to the actual pastors of the candidates and their congregations to give the *axios!* which would commend the candidates to the bishop for eventual ordination.

Not only is the need pressing, but the stakes are high, for souls are at stake in the process of preparing clergy. In James 3:1f St. James warned of the danger in becoming a pastor, reminding us that such teachers will receive “stricter judgment” than most (some translations render it “greater condemnation” than most). We therefore need to be careful who we ordain and take care to provide for those dear men the very best we can.

1od5ayf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1od5ayf/best_travel_backpack_for_laptop_and_clothes/,Best Travel Backpack For Laptop And Clothes,"I stood in the Geneva airport at 6 AM, watching my brand-new ""perfect"" travel backpack fail its first real test.

The laptop compartment? Too shallow for my 16-inch MacBook Pro. The ""spacious"" main compartment? Couldn't fit more than three days of clothes without looking like an overstuffed burrito. And those ""comfortable"" shoulder straps? Already digging into my shoulders after a 10-minute walk through the terminal.

That €200 mistake taught me something crucial: the right travel backpack for laptop and clothes isn't about having the most features or looking the coolest. It's about finding that rare unicorn that actually balances tech protection with enough space for your stuff, stays within airline carry-on limits, and doesn't destroy your back in the process.

After three years of testing 20+ backpacks across 15 countries—from cramped European budget airlines to cross-country trains in India—I've learned what actually works. Not what marketing teams promise, but what holds up when you're speed-walking through Charles de Gaulle with 30 minutes to catch your connection.

Here's what I discovered: the best travel backpack for your laptop and clothes exists, but it's different for everyone depending on your trip style, laptop size, and what ""enough clothes"" actually means to you.

# What Makes a Great Travel Backpack for Laptop and Clothes?

Before we dive into specific bags, let's talk about what actually matters when you're combining tech gear with travel essentials.

**The Holy Trinity of Travel Backpack Features:**

**Dedicated Laptop Protection**  
Your laptop compartment needs to do more than just exist. Look for suspended sleeves (not just a pocket), adequate padding on all sides, and easy TSA-friendly access. I learned this the hard way when my first backpack's laptop ""compartment"" was basically a fabric sleeve that let my MacBook bounce against my water bottle for 8 hours.

The sweet spot? A compartment that opens 180 degrees for airport security, sits against your back (not the outer layer where it gets banged around), and fits your actual laptop size. Not all 15-inch compartments are created equal—some fit my 15-inch Dell fine but choked on a 15-inch MacBook Pro because of thickness differences.

**Capacity That Makes Sense**  
Here's the thing about backpack sizes: a 40L backpack sounds bigger than 35L, but volume numbers lie. What matters more is *how* that space is organized.

For combining laptop and clothes, you want:

* 28-35L for weekend trips (2-4 days)
* 35-42L for week-long journeys (5-7 days)
* 40-45L maximum if you're pushing carry-on limits

Anything over 45L typically won't meet airline carry-on restrictions, and you'll be checking bags (defeating the whole purpose).

**Organization Without Overorganization**  
This is where most backpacks fail. Too many pockets and you're playing hide-and-seek with your charger. Too few and you're digging through dirty laundry to find your passport.

The Goldilocks zone includes:

* Main compartment for clothes (ideally clamshell opening)
* Separate laptop compartment (we covered this)
* Admin panel or tech organizer for cables/chargers
* Quick-access front pocket for boarding passes/snacks
* Water bottle pockets (external, please)

That's it. You don't need 47 pockets, secret compartments, and modular attachment points unless you're planning a heist.

# The 10 Best Travel Backpacks for Laptop and Clothes (Tested in 2025)

After living out of these bags for the past three years, here are the ones that actually delivered on their promises.

# 1. Cotopaxi Allpa 35L — Best Overall

**Price:** $220  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 16 inches  
**Weight:** 2.9 lbs  
**Best For:** Adventure travelers who need durability without sacrificing organization

I've dragged the Cotopaxi Allpa through Moroccan medinas, crammed it under budget airline seats, and stuffed it into Thai tuk-tuks. It's still going strong.

**Why it works:**  
The clamshell opening is life-changing. You lay it flat like a suitcase, see everything at once, and never play the ""where did I pack my clean shirt"" game at 2 AM in a hostel. The laptop compartment is genuinely padded—not just lined with thin fabric like cheaper options.

The mesh pockets on both sides of the main compartment create natural organization without forcing a specific packing style. One side for clean clothes, one for worn? Done. Tech accessories separate from toiletries? Easy.

**The reality check:**  
That 1000D polyester exterior is bombproof, but it looks a bit... blobby when not fully packed. If you care about sleek aesthetics, this might bother you. It doesn't bother me, but I know people who returned it for this reason alone.

Also, the hip belt isn't removable. If you're a minimalist who hates extra straps, you'll be tucking it behind the back panel constantly.

**Who should buy this:**  
Digital nomads and adventure travelers who prioritize durability and organization over looking like they stepped out of a tech startup photoshoot. If you're doing Southeast Asia, South America, or anywhere with questionable luggage handling, this is your pack.

# 2. Tortuga Travel Backpack Pro 40L — Most Comfortable

**Price:** $299  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 17 inches  
**Weight:** 3.6 lbs  
**Best For:** Those who value carry comfort and premium build quality

The first time I wore the Tortuga Pro 40L, I understood why people pay $300 for a backpack.

**Why it's worth it:**  
The harness system feels like it was designed by someone who actually carries heavy bags for hours, not just from a parking lot to an office. The hip belt has actual pockets—not decorative straps pretending to be pockets. My passport, phone, and some emergency cash all fit comfortably.

The height-adjustable torso lets you actually fit the pack to your body. I'm 5'8"", and most ""one size fits all"" packs hit me wrong. This one I could dial in perfectly.

Organization is thoughtful without being overwhelming. The admin panel for tech accessories is genuinely useful—designated spots for my laptop charger, USB cables, and portable battery meant I actually used them instead of creating a tangled mess.

**The honest downside:**  
It's heavy when empty. At 3.6 lbs, you're giving up over a pound compared to ultralight options. For digital nomads who pack light anyway, this doesn't matter. For ultralight travelers obsessing over every ounce, it's a dealbreaker.

The price tag is real. $299 isn't budget-friendly, though if you use it for 5+ years (like I plan to), it comes to $60/year. That's less than most checked bag fees.

**Who should buy this:**  
People who've had back problems from cheap backpacks, frequent business travelers who need to look presentable while carrying their entire office, or anyone willing to invest in comfort for long-term use.

# 3. Matein Travel Backpack — Best Budget Option

**Price:** $30-40  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 17 inches  
**Weight:** 2.2 lbs  
**Best For:** Budget travelers and students who need basic functionality

Here's the controversial take: the $30 Matein is shockingly good for the price.

**Why it punches above its weight:**  
For thirty dollars, you get a USB charging port (you provide the battery pack), multiple compartments, water-resistant fabric, and enough space for a weekend trip. The laptop compartment actually has padding—not premium padding, but padding nonetheless.

I bought this as a ""backup bag"" when traveling to areas with high theft risk. I figured if it got stolen, I'd be out $30 instead of $300. What surprised me was how well it actually worked.

The organization is decent. A front admin panel, main compartment, laptop sleeve, and external pockets cover the basics. It's not elegant, but it's functional.

**The tradeoffs:**  
Build quality is... adequate. The zippers feel like they're working hard just existing. I wouldn't trust this bag for years of heavy use, but for occasional travel or as a budget option while you save for something better? It works.

The shoulder straps are thin. After 2-3 hours of wearing it fully loaded, I was ready for a break. This isn't an all-day carry bag.

Water resistance is more ""water hesitant."" Light rain is fine. A tropical downpour? Your stuff is getting wet.

**Who should buy this:**  
College students on a tight budget, occasional travelers who fly 2-3 times a year, or anyone who needs a temporary solution and doesn't want to drop $200+ immediately. Just don't expect it to last a decade.

# 4. Osprey Farpoint 40 — Best for Adventure Travel

**Price:** $170  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 16 inches  
**Weight:** 3.1 lbs  
**Best For:** Backpackers who need serious suspension for carrying heavy loads

The Osprey Farpoint 40 is what happens when a hiking company makes a travel backpack. They just... couldn't help themselves.

**Why hikers and travelers both love it:**  
The suspension system is legitimately from their hiking line. Load-lifter straps, padded hip belt, adjustable sternum strap—it's designed for actual load-bearing. When I packed it to capacity for a 2-week trip through Vietnam (including camera gear), the hip belt transferred most of the weight off my shoulders. Game-changer.

The laptop compartment is accessible from the side, so I didn't have to open the main compartment at airport security. Small detail, huge convenience.

Osprey's lifetime warranty is real. My zipper pull broke in year two, and they fixed it no questions asked.

**The reality check:**  
It's not as sleek as modern travel packs. The design is functional over fashionable. If you're a digital nomad co-working in Bali, this might feel a bit too ""rugged backpacker"" for the aesthetic.

Organization is minimal. You get a big main compartment and that's mostly it. If you need lots of pockets and organization, you'll be buying packing cubes.

The materials are tough but not water-resistant. I got caught in a downpour in Chiang Mai and everything got damp. A rain cover is essential (thankfully included).

**Who should buy this:**  
Adventure travelers doing a mix of cities and outdoor activities, backpackers planning long trips with lots of walking, or anyone who's had shoulder pain from cheaper bags and needs actual support.

# 5. Aer Travel Pack 3 (35L) — Best for Organization Nerds

**Price:** $249  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 16 inches  
**Weight:** 4 lbs  
**Best For:** Organized travelers and digital nomads who live in co-working spaces

The Aer Travel Pack 3 is what you get when designers who clearly have OCD create a travel backpack. And I mean that as the highest compliment.

**Why organization nerds obsess over this:**  
Every. Single. Pocket. Has. A. Purpose.

The tech compartment alone has spots for laptop, tablet, cables, chargers, portable battery, pens, and even your AirPods case. Nothing is loose, nothing is hunting for space.

The main compartment has a clamshell opening with compression straps that actually work. I could pack 5 days of clothes, keep them compressed, and still access my laptop from the separate compartment without disturbing anything.

The materials are premium—ballistic nylon that could probably survive an actual war zone. The zippers are YKK, which is zipper-nerd-speak for ""these will outlive you.""

**The honest downside:**  
It's the heaviest pack on this list at 4 lbs empty. For weight-conscious travelers, this is a problem. When you're packing light, an extra 1-2 lbs in the bag itself eats into your clothes budget.

The organization can actually be TOO much. I sometimes found myself spending more time organizing my organization than just... packing. If you like throwing everything in one compartment and dealing with it later, all these pockets will drive you crazy.

At $249, it's premium-priced. You're paying for organization and build quality. If you just need ""a bag that works,"" there are cheaper options.

**Who should buy this:**  
Digital nomads who work from cafes and co-working spaces, business travelers who need to look professional, or anyone who experiences genuine joy from perfectly organized luggage. If you're the type who makes packing lists three weeks in advance, this is your soulmate.

# 6. Peak Design Travel Backpack 45L — Best for Photographers

**Price:** $299  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 16 inches  
**Weight:** 3.9 lbs  
**Best For:** Photographers, videographers, and gear-heavy travelers

Full disclosure: I'm a photographer, so I might be biased. But the Peak Design Travel Backpack solved problems I didn't even know I had.

**Why it's a photographer's dream:**  
The modular camera cube system means I can pack my camera gear in protective cubes, then remove them when I don't need the camera. Suddenly the backpack transforms from camera bag to travel pack.

It expands from 35L to 45L. When I'm flying, I compress it to meet carry-on size. When I'm on the ground and need to carry extra layers or souvenirs, I expand it. This flexibility is incredible.

The side access to the main compartment means I can grab my jacket without opening the top. Small detail, but when you're constantly moving between air-conditioned trains and tropical heat, this convenience is everything.

**The reality check:**  
The magnetic latch system looks cool in videos but can be finicky in real life. Sometimes it doesn't catch properly, and I've had the top flap pop open when I didn't want it to.

When expanded to 45L, some budget airlines will flag it as too large. I've had to compress it at the gate a few times. The compression works, but it's stressful.

At $299 with no camera cubes included (those are extra), it's an investment. The camera cubes that make this special cost another $70-150 depending on size.

**Who should buy this:**  
Photographers and videographers who need to protect gear, content creators traveling for work, or anyone who loves Peak Design's design aesthetic and wants maximum flexibility.

# 7. North Face Recon Backpack — Best for Students & Daily Use

**Price:** $99  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 15 inches  
**Weight:** 2.5 lbs  
**Best For:** Students, commuters, and weekend travelers who need versatility

The North Face Recon is that friend who's decent at everything without being amazing at anything. And sometimes that's exactly what you need.

**Why it's the Swiss Army knife of backpacks:**  
It works equally well for class, work commute, gym bag, and weekend trips. I've watched mine go from college lectures to hostel life to daily work carry without missing a beat.

The laptop compartment is legitimately padded and fleece-lined. My laptop has survived countless subway rides and accidental drops because this compartment actually protects it.

The external bungee cords hold a jacket or yoga mat. Specific enough to be useful, general enough to adapt to whatever you need.

At $99, it's affordable enough to not stress about but quality enough to last years (mine is on year 4).

**The honest assessment:**  
It's only 30L, which is fine for weekends but limiting for longer trips. I can pack 3 days of clothes comfortably, 4-5 days if I Tetris things perfectly.

Water resistance is meh. Light rain is fine. Heavy rain and your stuff gets damp. The bottom panel is more waterproof, but the zippers are weak points.

The styling is very... college student. If you're 35 and traveling for business, this might feel too casual.

**Who should buy this:**  
Students who need one bag for everything, commuters who occasionally travel, or anyone who wants a reliable workhorse under $100 that'll handle daily abuse plus occasional weekend trips.

# 8. EVERGOODS Civic Panel Loader 24L — Best Personal Item

**Price:** $279  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 16 inches  
**Weight:** 2.8 lbs  
**Best For:** Minimalist travelers and frequent flyers who want premium quality

The EVERGOODS CPL24 is stupid expensive for a small backpack. And it's worth every penny.

**Why minimalists love it:**  
It's technically 24L, but the organization is so good it feels bigger. The panel-loading design means I can access everything without digging through layers.

The build quality is absurd. 840D ballistic nylon, YKK zippers, Duraflex hardware—this is designed to outlive your grandchildren. EVERGOODS backs this with a lifetime warranty.

It fits under every airline seat I've tested (and I mean *every* seat, including budget European carriers with tiny spaces). As a personal item, it holds my laptop, 2-3 days of clothes, toiletries, and tech accessories.

The laptop compartment opens sideways, which felt weird at first but makes so much sense. My laptop is secure even when the compartment is open.

**The reality check:**  
At $279 for 24L, you're paying $11.62 per liter. Compare that to budget options at $1-2 per liter. Is it worth it? For frequent travelers, absolutely. For occasional users, probably not.

24L is *small*. This works for minimalist packers or as a personal item under the seat. If you need to pack for a week, look elsewhere.

The panel-loading is amazing for access but means you can't overstuff it. The bag has structure, which is great for protection but limits flexibility.

**Who should buy this:**  
Frequent flyers who want to never check bags, minimalist travelers who pack light religiously, or anyone who appreciates premium build quality and plans to use their backpack for decades.

# 9. Patagonia Black Hole MLC 45L — Best Convertible Option

**Price:** $179  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 15 inches  
**Weight:** 2.6 lbs  
**Best For:** Travelers who want flexibility between backpack, duffel, and briefcase modes

The Patagonia Black Hole MLC (Maximum Legal Carry-on) is an identity crisis in the best possible way.

**Why the flexibility matters:**  
Backpack mode for navigating airports and cities. Duffel mode for throwing in car trunks or train overhead racks. Briefcase mode for business meetings. The straps fully tuck away, so you're not wrestling with flapping straps in whichever mode you're not using.

The fabric is literally made from recycled fishing nets and plastic bottles, and it's bombproof. Weatherproof coated recycled ripstop is Patagonia-speak for ""this will survive anything.""

Internal organization includes pockets for smaller items, but the main space is largely open for flexible packing. Want to use packing cubes? Great. Want to just stuff things in? Also fine.

**The reality check:**  
At 45L, it's technically at the maximum carry-on size. Some budget airlines will make you measure it, and if you've overpacked, you might get flagged.

The laptop compartment is adequate but not amazing. It's padded, but not suspended or particularly well-protected compared to dedicated laptop backpacks.

The straps are minimally padded since this is meant to convert to duffel mode. For short carries it's fine, but after 30-40 minutes with a fully loaded bag, my shoulders started complaining.

**Who should buy this:**  
Travelers who frequently switch between transportation modes, road trippers who need flexibility, or anyone who values sustainable materials and wants a bag that's equally at home in business settings and adventure travel.

# 10. tomtoc Travel Backpack 40L — Best Value Mid-Range

**Price:** $88  
**Laptop Size:** Up to 17.3 inches  
**Weight:** 2.4 lbs  
**Best For:** Value-conscious travelers who want quality without premium prices

tomtoc is a brand most people haven't heard of, and that's exactly why it offers such good value. They're not paying for massive marketing campaigns.

**Why it's the best value:**  
You get TSA-friendly laptop access, decent organization, expandable capacity, and water-resistant fabric for under $90. That's remarkable value when comparable features cost $150-250 from bigger brands.

The clamshell opening works well for packing. The laptop compartment opens 180 degrees for security, which I used literally every time I flew.

At 40L, it's spacious enough for week-long trips without being oversized. I packed for 5 days in Scotland with room to spare.

**The honest tradeoffs:**  
The materials aren't premium. You're getting functional polyester, not exotic ballistic nylon. It'll last years with careful use, not decades of abuse.

The hip belt is basic. It exists, it's padded, but it's not adjustable or particularly supportive for heavy loads.

Brand recognition matters to some people. Walking around with tomtoc won't turn heads like Arc'teryx or Peak Design might. If that matters to you, spend more elsewhere.

**Who should buy this:**  
Practical travelers who prioritize function over brand names, people who travel 5-10 times a year (not full-time nomads), or anyone looking for the sweet spot between budget and premium without compromising on essential features.

# What to Look For When Buying (The Stuff Marketing Won't Tell You)

Here's what really matters based on three years of testing these bags in real conditions.

# Laptop Compartment Reality Check

**Size compatibility is lies.**  
A ""15-inch laptop compartment"" might not fit your 15-inch laptop. MacBooks are thicker than many Dells. Gaming laptops are beasts. Always check dimensional specs, not just screen size.

**Location matters more than padding.**  
Laptop compartments should sit against your back, not on the outer panel. When you set your bag down, you want your laptop protected by clothing and the bag structure, not facing the sidewalk.

**TSA-friendly is overrated unless you travel weekly.**  
180-degree opening for security looks cool but adds complexity (and cost). If you fly twice a year, just take your laptop out. If you fly twice a week, it's life-changing.

# Capacity Reality Check

**Liters lie.**  
A 40L backpack with great organization might hold less than a 35L bag with one big compartment. Shape matters more than volume.

For combining laptop with clothes:

* Weekend (2-3 nights): 28-32L minimum
* Week-long: 35-40L comfortable sweet spot
* 10+ days: 42-45L maximum for carry-on

**Personal item vs. carry-on strategy:**  
Some travelers prefer a smaller backpack (20-28L) as personal item under the seat, with a separate carry-on bag. Others prefer one 40L bag as their carry-on. Neither is wrong, but mixing strategies mid-trip is chaos.

# Comfort Details That Matter

**Hip belts: removable or stowable is non-negotiable.**  
You might not need the hip belt for a 20-minute airport walk, but you'll want it for a 2-hour city exploration. If it can't hide away, it'll snag on everything.

**Back panel ventilation matters in hot climates.**  
Mesh panels and airflow channels are the difference between mild back sweat and looking like you jumped in a pool. If you're traveling to tropical destinations, this is crucial.

**Sternum straps: must be adjustable in height.**  
One-size-fits-all sternum straps hit women wrong, tall people wrong, and short people wrong. Sliding adjustment is essential.

# The Organization Sweet Spot

Too many pockets: you forget where you put things and waste time hunting.  
Too few pockets: everything becomes a jumbled mess and nothing is accessible.

The ideal setup:

* Main compartment (flexible, 60-70% of space)
* Laptop compartment (suspended, padded)
* Tech organizer/admin panel (6-8 slots for cables/chargers)
* Quick-access pocket (boarding pass, snacks, phone)
* Water bottle pockets (EXTERNAL, both sides)

Everything else is extra.

# Materials That Actually Matter

**Water-resistant vs. waterproof:**  
Water-resistant: handles light rain, brief exposure  
Waterproof: handles downpours, but is heavier and less breathable

For most travelers, water-resistant with a packable rain cover is the sweet spot.

**Denier (D) numbers:**  
200-400D: lightweight, less durable  
500-800D: balanced durability  
840D+: bombproof, heavy

Higher isn't always better—it depends on your travel style.

**YKK zippers matter more than you think.**  
Cheap zippers are the #1 failure point. YKK or similar quality brands last years longer. This isn't brand snobbery—it's reliability.

# Common Mistakes People Make (That I Made Too)

**Mistake #1: Buying Too Big**  
""I might need the space"" is a trap. Larger bags encourage overpacking, which means heavier loads, which means pain. Buy for your typical trip, not your theoretical maximum.

**Mistake #2: Ignoring Laptop Orientation**  
Horizontal laptop sleeves waste space. Vertical sleeves integrate better with the bag's shape. This seems trivial until you're trying to fit 4 days of clothes around a horizontal brick.

**Mistake #3: Prioritizing Features Over Fit**  
All the pockets in the world don't matter if the shoulder straps hit wrong or the torso length doesn't match your body. Try it on loaded, or at least check return policies.

**Mistake #4: Assuming ""Travel Backpack"" Means Good**  
Marketing labels don't mean quality. Some ""travel backpacks"" are rebranded hiking packs. Some are just expensive messes. Read reviews from people who actually used them for travel, not just unboxing videos.

**Mistake #5: Forgetting About Daily Use**  
Your travel backpack will likely become your carry-on personal item on non-travel days. Make sure it doesn't scream ""I'M A TRAVELER"" if you plan to use it for work commutes or coffee shops.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I really fit clothes AND a laptop without checking bags?**  
Yes, but it requires being realistic about ""enough clothes."" I pack:

* 3-4 shirts (quick-dry, versatile colors)
* 2 pants/shorts (one wearing, one packed)
* Underwear for trip length + 1 day buffer
* 1 jacket/fleece layer
* Minimal toiletries (hotel soap exists)
* Laptop + charger + essential cables

This fits comfortably in 35-40L with room for small purchases.

**What laptop size should I actually get a backpack for?**  
Measure your laptop—diagonal screen size lies. A 16-inch MacBook Pro is 14"" x 9.8"" x 0.66"". Get a compartment rated for one size up (17-inch) for comfort, or exact size with thick padding.

**Are expensive backpacks actually worth it?**  
Depends on usage frequency:

* Travel 1-3 times/year: budget options ($50-100) are fine
* Travel 5-10 times/year: mid-range ($100-200) worth it for durability
* Travel 15+ times/year or full-time: premium ($200-350) pays for itself in comfort and longevity

Divide the cost by expected years of use. A $300 bag used for 5 years is $60/year, less than checking bags twice.

**How do I know if it'll actually fit as carry-on?**  
Most airlines allow 22"" x 14"" x 9"" (56cm x 36cm x 23cm) for carry-on, but budget carriers are stricter. Check your specific airline.

Pro tip: soft-sided bags have flex. A 40L backpack that's 22.5 inches tall but not stuffed completely will compress into the sizing box.

**What's the ideal weight for an empty backpack?**  
Under 3 lbs is ideal, 3-4 lbs is acceptable if features justify it, over 4 lbs and you're carrying unnecessary weight. Remember: every pound in the bag is a pound less for your actual stuff.

# My Final Honest Recommendation

After testing all these bags, here's what I actually grab depending on the trip:

**For most people most of the time:** Cotopaxi Allpa 35L  
It's durable, organized, and survives real-world abuse. The price ($220) sits in the ""investment but not ridiculous"" range.

**If money is tight:** tomtoc 40L  
You get 80% of premium bag features for 30% of the price. It won't last forever, but it'll last long enough.

**If you travel constantly for work:** Tortuga Travel Backpack Pro 40L  
The comfort investment pays off when you're wearing it 100+ days a year. Your back will thank you.

**If you're a student or occasional traveler:** North Face Recon  
One bag for everything—class, gym, weekend trips, daily commute. The versatility is unmatched for the price.

**If you need maximum protection and have the budget:** Aer Travel Pack 3 or Peak Design Travel Backpack  
Premium materials, premium organization, premium price. These last decades.

Here's what nobody tells you: the ""perfect"" travel backpack doesn't exist. Every bag is a compromise between weight, space, organization, comfort, durability, and price.

The question isn't ""what's the best backpack?"" It's ""what's the best backpack for *me*, for *this* trip, at *this* price point?""

My Geneva airport disaster backpack? I returned it after one trip. The Cotopaxi Allpa I bought as a replacement? Still going strong 3 years and 24 countries later.

Sometimes you nail it on the first try. Sometimes you need to learn what you actually need versus what marketing told you to want.

1od5at2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1od5at2/i_need_help/,I need help,"This is my first reddit post. I don't really know where to start from. I'm 18, a female and i live in Bangladesh. I'm an only child. I've got my hsc next year. But I'm at a position in life that idrk how to deal with things anymore. It feels like my body's giving up. My mental health is messed up too. As a kid my life used to be pretty nice. My family was financially and mentally stable at that time. I had people around me, like my cousins especially. It all went downhills around 7 years back i think? I was 11. I moved to a new place and we knew nobody there. All my cousins were already grown ups at that time, so they started to get married and became too busy with their own lives. I was left alone with nobody around me, not to mention that my parents are extremely strict so i can barely ever go out or do anything really. Later in 2020 when covid started, my dad went bankrupt. He was left with nothing. When i say nothing i mean ABSOLUTELY nothing. Idrk how we're still surviving. We've been struggling with our lives ever since. My experience hasn’t been the best especially after a drastic change in my lifestyle. We can afford close to nothing now. We somehow manage to have our meals everyday. My dad's still in huge debt. I still study in a well known institution. My classmates are all well off. I'm happy for them. But our struggle gets to me really bad sometimes. I always feel drained mentally and feel fatigued. I need coffee to be able to actually study. My parents can't afford it. My parents can't afford a new light bulb for my bathroom ever since the previous one went dead like 3 months back. I've never really been a gifted student either. I'm not the best at it plus i don't like it a lot either. We can't afford my tuition cost anymore. Idk how I'm gonna deal with my life anymore. All my cousins went to public Unis. They were all brilliant students. My parents expect the same from me. First of all the state of our country isn’t the same anymore. The public Unis are corrupted. I'm not in the position to ace the admission tests either. We can't afford the tuition fees for a private Uni. I can't study in any random uni or college that provides the honours degree, i just can't. Idk what I'm gonna do. I didn’t know I'm gonna run out of options for my growth in the future. Idk what I'm gonna do. I need money. I need my life back. It's embarrassing. I didn’t know I'd have to post smth like this. Idk what made me do it but yeah.",1,1761131405.0,Adulting,4,1.0,False

1od5a01,https://v.redd.it/4phrm8qgbnwf1,How to make a Latte with an AeroPress,"Or at least, something akin to a latte! This milky brew has the body and strength of a latte, using nothing but an AeroPress and a cafetiere to froth the milk.

• I use a whole scoop full of a fairly dark roast of beans, which is about 20g.

• Ground slightly coarser than espresso. 9 clicks on my Time more Chestnut C3 Pro.

• I use two filters, wetted, to ease any bitterness.

• Pour coffee into the press at number three. I do inverted so pour to the top here, just pour to three if you brew regular. And give a good ol wiggle stir to make sure all grounds are wet. 

• Depress firmly but not so much that you are really forcing it. Just about as much as feels comfortable.

• Microwave as much milk as desired (I just eyeballed it) for about 30-45 secs. Then use the cafetiere to froth it. One or two big pumps to add air to the milk, then several smaller pumps within the milk to texturise. 

• Then pour, and if you can, do some latter art! I can't :(

• For a twist, I sometimes put a tsp of Pumpkin spice mix (1 part cinnamon, 1/4 part nutmeg, 1/4 part ginger, 1/8 part cloves) into the chamber with the coffee. Just make sure to use a coarser grind, and one filter, otherwise it's impossible to depress. And I add a tsp of sugar to this too. It's autumnal and warming, without being oversweet like you get from syrups.

Hope this is interesting for someone. Any tips on my process are appreciated. I'm not really an exact measurement kinda guy, so 'one scoop' and 'enough milk' works for me lol.",22,1761131330.0,AeroPress,2,0.92,False

The week, the depression and the comics Part 128.5","Well, my work was over early, the roof of the warehouse was leaking, autumn is cold and wet this year and I'm getting nervous when I'm supposed to be in the open warehouse next week. I love this time of year I have to say, but believe me I like it better when you're at home with tea. especially because it's kind of getting on my nerves the darkness so early, it's also eerie because of the almost empty streets, buses and trains on the way to work.

So, the topic of our Bookclub was cozy Halloween, with the Classic original collection the scary Godmother, a blast for the time, a mondern holiday classic.

Autumn is my favorite season, i connected it to memoirs to get together with family by a uncle,  who had kind of giant hous back them in the nowhere of the Rheinland-Pfalz. It is usually true at many points the house is under construction, or empty. I kind of spooky when I was little, but cozy on the fireplace.

As a result, I've now got quite a few beans that are definitely past their peak and have noticeably lost some of their flavour, particularly the more delicate notes.

I usually brew with the Hario Switch, using a hybrid method (similar to Coffee Chronicler's recipe), so I've been experimenting with variables in an attempt to pull as much flavour out of the beans as possible. Long story short, I've found that extending the immersion phase has dramatically helped. With the beans that have lost the most flavour, I'm extending immersion to around three minutes, and the results have been fantastic. Obviously the brews don't taste quite good as when the beans were at their peak, but if you've got coffee that's losing flavour, I can highly recommend giving this a try.

The grocery store, the coffee shop, the bus. Everyone's staring at their phones. Couples sitting across from each other scrolling. Parents ignoring their kids to check notifications. People walking into things because they can't look up for ten seconds.

We've normalized something that's completely insane. We're willingly giving away hours of our lives every single day to apps designed to keep us hooked, and we all just act like it's fine.

I didn't think I had a problem. I'd tell myself I was just staying connected, staying informed, being productive. But then I actually looked at my screen time. Seven hours a day. On my phone. That's a full-time job worth of scrolling, and I had nothing to show for it.

The scary part is how automatic it became. Wake up, grab phone. Waiting for coffee, pull out phone. Red light, check phone. Bathroom, bring phone. Before bed, scroll until I couldn't keep my eyes open. I wasn't making conscious decisions anymore. My hand just moved to my pocket like a reflex.

And I'm not special. Everyone I know is doing the same thing. We've all become these half-present zombies, physically in one place but mentally somewhere else. Having dinner with friends but checking Instagram between bites. Watching a movie but also scrolling Twitter. We can't just exist in one moment anymore.

The breaking point for me was watching a kid on the subway. Maybe seven years old. Completely glued to a tablet while his dad was glued to his phone. Neither of them said a word to each other for twenty minutes. And I realized that's where we're headed. A generation of people who don't know how to be bored, who can't sit with their own thoughts, who need constant digital stimulation just to feel normal.

I tried to quit cold turkey once. Lasted two days before the anxiety got so bad I caved. That's when I realized this isn't just a habit. It's an addiction. And we're all feeding it every single day.

So I tried something different. I started tracking when I reached for my phone and why. Most of the time there was no reason. I was just uncomfortable, bored, avoiding something, or filling a three-second gap. Once I saw the pattern, it became harder to ignore.

I deleted social media from my phone. Not my accounts, just the apps. If I wanted to check something I had to do it on my computer. That friction alone cut my usage in half. I stopped bringing my phone to the bathroom. Left it in another room when I ate meals. Put it on airplane mode after 9 PM.

It's been four months now. My screen time is down to two hours a day and most of that is actually useful stuff. Navigation, music, texts. Not mindless consumption.

I can now sit through an entire conversation without my hand twitching toward my pocket. I can watch a sunset without needing to photograph it. I can wait in line without immediately looking for distraction. I remember what I read because I'm actually paying attention.

The weirdest part is seeing everyone else still trapped in it. The constant checking. The panic when they can't find their phone. The way they're only half-present in every interaction. And nobody talks about it like the crisis it actually is.

We're watching an entire society develop a dependency on devices that literally profit from keeping us hooked, and we've just accepted it as normal. Kids are growing up thinking this is how humans are supposed to live. Always connected, always distracted, never fully here.

I'm not saying technology is evil or we should all go live in the woods. But we need to admit what's happening. We're trading real experiences for digital simulacra. We're trading presence for perpetual distraction. And most of us don't even realize how much we've lost.

If you can't go two hours without checking your phone, you're not connected. You're dependent. And maybe it's time to ask if we're the ones in control or its our phones that is in control.",13,1761130968.0,TheImprovementRoom,1,1.0,False
1od55z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1od55z4/best_backpack_for_laptop/,Best Backpack For Laptop,"I broke the zipper on my last laptop backpack while sprinting through O'Hare Airport. The laptop compartment just... gave up. My MacBook slid halfway out onto the terminal floor, and I had that awful split-second realization that I'd been trusting a $30 backpack with my $2,000 computer.

That moment changed how I think about laptop backpacks.

After testing 17 different backpacks over six months—from budget Amazon bestsellers to premium photography bags—I've learned that the ""best"" laptop backpack depends entirely on what you're actually doing with it. Are you biking through rain to get to work? Boarding budget airlines every week? Carrying camera gear and a 17-inch gaming laptop? The backpack that's perfect for a college student might be overkill (or underwhelming) for a digital nomad.

Here's what I discovered works, what breaks, and which backpacks are actually worth your money in 2025.

# What Makes a Laptop Backpack Actually Good?

Before we jump into specific bags, here's what actually matters after months of daily use:

**The suspended laptop sleeve is non-negotiable.** This means the laptop compartment has a ""false bottom""—it doesn't reach all the way to the bottom of the bag. When you inevitably drop your backpack (you will), your laptop isn't slamming into concrete. I learned this the hard way with that broken backpack at O'Hare.

**Water resistance is a spectrum.** Every brand claims their bag is ""water-resistant,"" but what they really mean is ""will keep your laptop dry in light drizzle for about 15 minutes."" True waterproofing is rare and usually involves roll-top designs. Most backpacks have a weak spot: the zippers. Even the expensive ones.

**Comfort matters more than you think.** A backpack that feels fine empty can turn into a shoulder-destroying nightmare when you load it with a laptop, charger, books, and a water bottle. Look for padded shoulder straps, breathable back panels, and—this is key—a sternum strap that actually stays in place.

**Organization is personal.** Some people want a pocket for literally everything. Others (like me) prefer a few large compartments and don't want to spend five minutes remembering which of 47 tiny pockets holds their AirPods.

Now let's get into the actual backpacks.

# 1. Timbuk2 Authority Laptop Backpack Deluxe – Best Overall

**Price:** \~$169 | **Laptop Size:** Up to 17"" | **Capacity:** 28L

This is the backpack I keep coming back to, even after testing options that cost twice as much.

**Why it works:** The Authority Deluxe does that rare thing where it's incredibly well-organized without feeling fussy. There's a dedicated laptop compartment accessible from the outside (genius for airport security), a second padded sleeve inside for a tablet, and enough pockets that I actually remember where I put things. The compression straps on the bottom let you cinch down a jacket or hoodie, which sounds minor until you're traveling and that feature saves you from checking a bag.

The comfort level genuinely surprised me. I biked 3 miles to a coworking space with this thing fully loaded—laptop, iPad, chargers, notebooks, lunch—and my shoulders didn't hate me afterward. The air mesh back panel actually works; I didn't arrive looking like I'd swum there.

**The honest downside:** The water bottle holder is weirdly narrow. My 32oz Hydro Flask barely fits and is impossible to grab while wearing the pack. Also, those pen sleeves in the front organizer pocket? Completely useless unless you have incredibly thin pens. I have no idea who they're designed for.

**Who should buy this:** Office commuters, students with a lot of gear, anyone who needs a professional-looking backpack that can handle daily punishment. It's that sweet spot of looking put-together in meetings but being functional enough for weekend trips.

**One more thing:** Timbuk2's lifetime warranty is legit. A friend had a strap start fraying after two years of heavy use, filled out a form, and had a new backpack shipped within a week.

# 2. The North Face Recon – Best Value for Quality

**Price:** \~$99-109 | **Laptop Size:** Up to 16"" | **Capacity:** 30L

If someone handed me $100 and said ""buy a laptop backpack,"" I'd walk out with the Recon without hesitation.

**Why it's the value king:** For just over $100, you're getting genuinely premium features. The FlexVent suspension system (certified by the American Chiropractic Association, which feels important when your back starts complaining) distributes weight better than backpacks twice its price. The laptop compartment is enormous—I tested it with a thicc 15-inch gaming laptop and still had room to spare.

The organizational setup just makes sense. Three main compartments keep things separated without the ""where did I put my keys?"" chaos of overly complex bags. External mesh pockets actually hold water bottles securely—a detail that matters when you're not trying to chase a rolling bottle across a train platform.

**The honest catch:** In my shower test (yes, I hosed down every backpack), water got in faster than I'd like. The zippers aren't waterproof, and a heavy rainstorm will soak through eventually. Also, if you bike a lot, the center back panel has this unpadded strip that digs in when you're leaned forward. Not a dealbreaker, but noticeable.

**Who should buy this:** Students on a budget, anyone building out their first ""adult"" work setup, people who need something reliable but don't want to drop $300. It's also excellent if you want one bag that works for both work and weekend hiking.

**Real talk:** This backpack looks exactly like what a college student or young professional would carry, which is either a pro or a con depending on your vibe. If you're looking for something that screams ""creative professional,"" keep scrolling.

# 3. Matein Travel Laptop Backpack – Best Budget Option

**Price:** \~$30-40 | **Laptop Size:** Up to 17.3"" | **Capacity:** 40L

I bought this to test the ""too good to be true"" Amazon bestseller phenomenon. Plot twist: it's actually good.

**The surprise:** For $35, this bag has no right being as functional as it is. Built-in USB port for phone charging (bring your own power bank), TSA-friendly laptop compartment that opens flat, luggage pass-through strap, and more pockets than I know what to do with. The padded laptop sleeve feels substantial, and after six months of a family member using it weekly for flights, it still looks new.

The organizational system is genuinely well-thought-out. Front panel has three separate pockets, main compartment is cavernous, and there's a secret back pocket against your spine—perfect for passport or wallet when traveling.

**The catch (because there's always a catch):** The materials feel fine, not premium. Water bottle pockets are shallow mesh that won't hold anything larger than a standard disposable bottle. And while I've seen these last a couple of years with regular use, you're not getting a decade-long companion here. It's also not waterproof beyond light rain—the fabric absorbs water fairly quickly.

**Who should buy this:** Students who need something functional but can't drop $100+ right now. Frequent travelers who want a dedicated ""travel backpack"" that won't devastate you if it gets lost or damaged. Anyone starting their first job and building out a work setup on a budget.

**Why it matters:** Sometimes you just need a backpack that works without overthinking it. This is that backpack.

# 4. Peak Design Everyday Backpack V2 – Best for Photographers (and Gear Nerds)

**Price:** \~$260 (20L) / $300 (30L) | **Laptop Size:** Up to 16"" | **Capacity:** 20L or 30L

This backpack is engineering pornography. I mean that as a compliment.

**The Peak Design difference:** Everything about this bag feels intentional. The MagLatch closure opens with one hand. Side zippers give you instant access to the main compartment without taking the bag off. FlexFold dividers let you customize the interior like you're playing Tetris with your camera gear. Expandable capacity means you can pack it tight for daily carry or expand it when you need more space.

The magnetic features are everywhere and they're addictive. Straps snap into place magnetically when you take the backpack off so they don't flop around. Small touch, huge quality-of-life improvement. The weatherproofing is also genuinely impressive—I've used this in Pacific Northwest rain without worry.

**The reality check:** At $300 for the 30L, this isn't an impulse purchase. It's also heavier than you'd expect (3.4 lbs empty). And if you're not carrying camera gear or multiple devices, you're paying for features you won't use. The organizing system is incredible if you have lots of tech to manage, but might be overkill for a laptop and notebook.

**Who should buy this:** Professional photographers and videographers who need to carry cameras plus laptops. Digital nomads with expensive gear setups. Anyone who genuinely loves well-designed products and will use this daily for years. If you're the type who researches purchases for months, you'll love this bag.

**One more thing:** Peak Design's lifetime warranty and used marketplace (where you can buy returned/lightly used bags at a discount) makes the price slightly easier to swallow.

# 5. Evergoods Civic Panel Loader 24L (CPL24) – Best for Durability Obsessives

**Price:** \~$279 | **Laptop Size:** Up to 16"" | **Capacity:** 24L

This backpack is built like it expects a zombie apocalypse.

**Why durability nerds love it:** Evergoods uses custom 840D ballistic nylon that feels like you could drag this thing behind a truck and it'd survive. The zippers are beefy YKK models that glide smoothly even after months of use. Every stress point is reinforced. This bag says ""I will outlast you and possibly your children.""

The organizational system is chef's kiss for tech carry. Front panel opens completely for airport security. Internal pockets keep cables from becoming a tangled nightmare. Laptop compartment is highly protective with that crucial false bottom. And it looks grown-up professional—perfect for client meetings or office environments where your boss would side-eye a hiking backpack.

**The honest trade-off:** It's $279. For a backpack. That number requires either significant income or serious justification. Also, at 24L, it's on the smaller side—fine for daily commutes but limiting for travel. And the external aesthetics, while professional, are pretty understated. If you want heads to turn, this isn't that bag.

**Who should buy this:** People who use their backpack every single day and want to buy once. Professionals in fields where looking polished matters. Anyone who's tired of replacing backpacks every couple of years and wants to calculate the long-term cost-per-use.

**The calculation:** At $279, if you use this daily for 5 years, that's about $0.15 per day. Cheaper backpacks that last 2 years come out to more in the long run. Math!

# 6. Tortuga Travel Daypack Pro – Best for Minimalist Travelers

**Price:** \~$125 | **Laptop Size:** Up to 16"" | **Capacity:** 21L

This bag understands airline personal item limits better than most humans.

**The travel optimization:** At 21L, the Daypack Pro is specifically sized to fit under airplane seats on pretty much every carrier. I've used it as a personal item on United, Delta, and even Spirit (the final boss of strict bag policies), and it slides right under without drama. Quick-access front pocket holds passport and boarding pass. Back panel opens fully for TSA screening. Luggage strap keeps it secured to your rolling bag.

The internal organization is minimal in the best way—large main compartment with a few strategic pockets rather than a million tiny ones. Laptop sleeve is well-padded with a false bottom. At 1.8 lbs empty, it's one of the lightest backpacks I tested that still feels substantial.

**The limitation:** If you're trying to pack for more than a weekend, 21L fills up fast. Also, no water bottle pocket, which baffles me. And the more minimalist organization means you need to be okay with some things just floating in the main compartment.

**Who should buy this:** Frequent flyers who've had it with airlines' bullshit bag fees. Digital nomads who prefer carry-on-only travel. Anyone who subscribes to the ""one bag travel"" philosophy. People who want a slim daypack that doesn't scream ""tourist.""

**Pro tip:** This works brilliantly for commuters who don't need to haul textbooks or lots of gear. If your daily carry is laptop, charger, notebook, and lunch, this is perfectly sized.

# 7. WANDRD PRVKE – Best for Camera + Laptop Combo

**Price:** \~$200-300 | **Laptop Size:** Up to 15"" | **Capacity:** 21L or 31L

Two brothers couldn't find a camera backpack they liked, so they built their own. That origin story shows in every detail.

**The camera-first design:** The PRVKE has three ways to access your gear: roll-top opening, full-length side zippers, or quick-access side pockets. When you're shooting and need to grab a lens fast, that matters. The internal camera cube is brilliant—fully customizable padding that you can remove entirely when you're not carrying camera gear.

The laptop compartment is cleverly integrated into the main section, protected but accessible. External straps let you lash a tripod to the outside. And the weatherproofing is serious—tarped roll-top closure with full rain cover included.

**The compromise:** It's a camera bag first, laptop bag second. If you're not carrying photo/video gear regularly, you're paying for features you don't need. Also, the roll-top design means you can't just unzip the top for quick access—you have to roll it down and re-roll it. Not a huge deal, but it's slower than a regular zipper.

**Who should buy this:** Working photographers and videographers. Content creators who travel with gear. Hybrid shooters who need both photo equipment and a laptop. Anyone whose job involves documenting things professionally.

**The verdict:** If your work involves cameras, this bag just makes sense. If not, look elsewhere.

# 8. SwissGear 1900 Scansmart – Best for Students Hauling Heavy Loads

**Price:** \~$70-90 | **Laptop Size:** Up to 17"" | **Capacity:** \~30L

This is the backpack equivalent of a reliable Honda Civic: not exciting, but it'll get you through college and then some.

**The student favorite:** SwissGear makes backpacks that survive semester after semester of being stuffed with textbooks, thrown on dorm floors, and generally abused. The 1900 has a lay-flat laptop compartment for TSA screening (helpful for students flying home for holidays), tons of organizational pockets for calculators and pens, and materials that hold up to daily punishment.

The Scansmart feature means the laptop section opens completely flat without removing your computer—useful in academic buildings with security checkpoints or when you need to grab your laptop quickly in the library.

**The reality:** It's bulky. Completely filled, this bag looks and feels substantial. The design is functional rather than stylish—you won't win any fashion awards. And quality control can be hit-or-miss; check reviews for your specific color/model.

**Who should buy this:** College students, especially those in STEM fields carrying heavy textbooks plus laptops. High school students prepping for college. Anyone who needs serious carrying capacity on a student budget.

**Why it works:** Sometimes you just need a workhorse bag that costs less than your textbooks. This is that bag.

# 9. GoRuck GR1 – Best for ""Buy It For Life"" Philosophy

**Price:** \~$395 | **Laptop Size:** Up to 17"" | **Capacity:** 21L or 26L

This backpack was designed by a former Green Beret, and it shows.

**The tactical approach:** GoRuck bags are built to military specifications using 1000D Cordura nylon. They come with a lifetime guarantee—not ""manufacturing defects,"" but straight-up lifetime. Bomb-proof YKK zippers, reinforced stress points, and a design philosophy that prioritizes function over frills.

The laptop compartment is against your back (ideal weight distribution for rucking or long carries), well-padded, and can handle even thicc gaming laptops. The internal organization is minimal—one main compartment with a couple of pockets—which some people love and others hate.

**The honest assessment:** It's $395. For that money, you can buy three other good backpacks. The design is aggressively no-nonsense tactical; you'll either love that aesthetic or want something more refined. And at 3.2 lbs empty, it's heavier than most civilian backpacks.

**Who should buy this:** People who want to buy exactly one backpack and use it for 20+ years. Former military who appreciate the design language. Folks who do rucking or fitness training with weighted packs. Anyone who finds quality of materials deeply satisfying.

**The philosophy:** If you're the type who researches the lifetime cost-per-use of every purchase, this bag makes sense. If you like variety or might want a different bag in a few years, it's overkill.

# 10. Herschel Retreat – Best for Style-First Buyers

**Price:** \~$100-130 | **Laptop Size:** Up to 15"" | **Capacity:** 19.5L

Not every backpack needs to optimize for maximum gear capacity. Sometimes you just want something that looks good.

**The style advantage:** The Herschel Retreat has that effortless cool aesthetic that works in coffee shops, creative offices, or casual Fridays. The signature striped lining is instantly recognizable. It comes in about 47 different colorways, so finding one that matches your vibe is easy.

The laptop sleeve is padded and protective (though no false bottom, which worries me). Front pocket has basic organization. Build quality is solid for the price. And at 19.5L, it forces you to pack intentionally rather than bringing everything you own.

**The functional reality:** This is style over substance. If you're biking in rain, carrying heavy loads daily, or traveling frequently, better options exist. The organization is basic. Water resistance is minimal. And laptop protection, while present, isn't as robust as backpacks designed laptop-first.

**Who should buy this:** People for whom aesthetics matter as much as function. Folks with light daily carry (laptop, notebook, charger, lunch). Anyone working in creative industries where your gear is part of your personal brand.

**The verdict:** Know what you're getting—a good-looking backpack that handles basic laptop carry well but isn't built for heavy-duty use.

# How to Choose: The Decision Framework

After testing all these bags, here's how I'd actually make the decision:

**If money is tight:** Start with the Matein (\~$40) or The North Face Recon (\~$100). Both punch above their price point. Use them daily for a year and figure out what you actually need in a backpack, then upgrade if necessary.

**If you're a daily commuter:** Timbuk2 Authority Deluxe. It's the Goldilocks option—professional enough for the office, functional enough for real life, durable enough to last.

**If you travel constantly:** Tortuga Travel Daypack Pro for one-bag carry, or go larger with the Peak Design if you need camera gear too.

**If you carry expensive gear:** Peak Design Everyday or Evergoods CPL24. The extra protection and quality are worth it when you're protecting thousands of dollars of equipment.

**If you want one bag forever:** GoRuck GR1. Buy once, use for decades.

**If you're a student:** North Face Recon or SwissGear 1900, depending on how much stuff you carry daily.

# The Stuff Nobody Tells You

**Test the weight loaded, not empty.** Every backpack feels comfortable when it's empty. Load it with your actual daily gear and walk around for 20 minutes. Your shoulders will tell you the truth.

**Zippers fail first.** YKK zippers last longer. Cheap zippers will absolutely break at the worst possible moment (like, say, sprinting through O'Hare). Check what zippers the backpack uses before buying.

**False bottoms aren't optional.** If the laptop compartment reaches all the way to the bottom of the bag, your laptop is one hard drop away from disaster. This feature alone is worth paying more for.

**Water-resistant ≠ waterproof.** Your laptop will probably survive light rain. It will not survive a downpour. If you bike or walk in serious weather, invest in a rain cover or accept that you'll need to protect your gear differently.

**Organization is personal.** I love minimal organization with a few large pockets. My partner needs a designated spot for literally everything. Test your stuff in the backpack layout before committing if possible.

**Try it loaded.** Seriously, pack the backpack like you would normally use it and wear it around the store for 10 minutes. Most places let you do this, and it's the only way to know if it'll actually work for your body and carry style.

# Final Thoughts

The right laptop backpack is the one you'll actually use daily without thinking about it. It should protect your tech, keep you comfortable, hold what you need, and not fall apart after six months.

I still rotate between the Timbuk2 Authority Deluxe for work and the Peak Design for travel, depending on what I'm doing that day. Both have earned their spot because they solve real problems without creating new ones.

Your laptop cost you at least $1,000, probably more. Protecting it with a $35 backpack makes sense for some people (seriously, the Matein is good for the price). But if you use it daily, investing in something built to last stops being an expense and starts being cost-effective.

1od54gu,https://v.redd.it/sl7dxf34anwf1,I finally love someone enough to let them go.,"We fell in love at The Band CAMINO concert. And now, somehow, we're walking away at one too. Life really does love full circles.

I know that in order for her to heal, really heal, she needs to be free. I just want her to be happy. Truly happy. People might think I'm supposed to despise her, but I can't. She's been hurt so much, and it isn't her fault.

This hurts me in ways I never knew was possible. It feels like part of me is being torn from my body, but if letting her go is what love is all about, then so be it, even though it could leave me shattered to bits. She deserves to grow and live her life without the sense of feeling I'm holding her back.

We had dreams. Mornings of coffee, creating our little cat empire together, chasing our dreams together. I craved it all,  every little  beautiful bit.

Love isn't always holding on, though. Sometimes it's stepping quietly out of the way and praying the one you love finds peace. I would have done anything for her. And maybe this,  this letting go, is the hardest thing I'll ever do for her.

A part of me will always belong to you. ",1,1761130823.0,u_SingTheDamnSong,0,0.67,False

1od540r,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreeceTravel/comments/1od540r/lessons_learned_traveling_to_greece_athens/,Lessons learned traveling to Greece (Athens & Thessaloniki),"Sharing my Lessons learned from my trip to Athens and Thessaloniki 

-if you like making your own travel arrangements then you could do this cheaper then I did with a travel agent. I spent $5k for 8 days, 3 in Athens, 5 in Thessaloniki.  5 trip days, 3 free days.
-Get a travel credit card and start using it. Earn points that you can redeem for some of the travel cost.
-Determine number of days you want to stay. 8-10 days is prob fine.
-Use a travel site to find a cheap flight.  Mid week travel is prob best. Avoid connecting flights. Direct is preferred.  You can fly direct into Athens and then take a 30-minute flight over to Thessaloniki when time to visit.  Check baggage fee for paying up front vs paying at check in.  The airports at both locations are nice and easy to get thru.  Does help to be there 2 hrs early just in case.  In both of my cases my gate number was not known in advance so I had to checking the board to see what it was.  
- Use travel site to find a hotel.  Look for discounts or package deal. Get breakfast included. They have ‘city fees’ that are not part of hotel fees so it’s an extra cost you have to pay. Not all hotels have coffee machines in the room.  To supply power to the room you need to insert your room key card in a slot by door.  Otherwise not all outlets or TV will work.  Might be good to get 2 keys as a result. 
- Use trip advisor to find local day trips.  Many options available.  Determine if you want to go solo vs a group.  Benefits to both.  There are so many things to do you could go on a trip every day of your vacation. If you go in group you may not have to tip.  If you go solo there might be expectations that you should tip.  Going in group you are dependent upon others. Going solo you do as you want, see what you want and take as long as you want.
- Really think about if you need a car.  Driving is crazy.  If you’ve driven in NYC then think of that but only twice as bad. Too many cars, motorcycles, scooters on the road. Yes you are sharing the road with someone on a scooter who has no seatbelt or helmet on.  Motorcycles cut in and out of traffic all the time.  Between taxis and walking you will do fine to get around local town. 
- Determine how much cash on hand you want to take.  I had taken $400 but spent another $500 on my visa travel card.  Currency exchange rates are not favorable to US travelers.  Better to have more than enough to pay cash for everything than paying extras with a card.  Example 1 Euro = $1.25 US dollars.  It adds up.  
- Think about your spending plan.   You will need at least one another meal besides breakfast. Random snacks and coffees will add up. Gifts for others will add up.  Maybe have gift list ahead of time. Spur of moment spending will drain your wallet. Tips for drivers add up. Seems some expect a tip while others do not. Hotel fees add up. Airport baggage fees add up.  Etc etc etc
- Beware of scammers.  Locals will recognize you as a tourist .  Homeless folks will ask you for money while other local folks are standing right  next to you. Pick pockets are out.  Think about Fanny packs for front of you.  Beware of over charging.  If you don’t know or don’t see a price ask.  Don’t assume it will be comparable to what you pay at home.  Learned hard way by how much a glass of wine cost.  
- if I have to do it over again I’ll try it on my own with the lessons learned above.  ",1,1761130785.0,GreeceTravel,0,1.0,False

1od51ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1od51ah/spent_2_hours_on_a_single_instagram_caption_use/,Spent 2+ hours on a single Instagram caption? Use this prompt to fix that problem. Here's the whole system.,"Nihao everyone,

Real talk: writing Instagram captions shouldn't be this hard.

You've got a great photo. You sit down to write a caption. You type something, delete it, try again. You Google ""Instagram caption ideas"" and find lists of generic quotes that have nothing to do with your post. An hour later, you've got three sentences that feel... meh. You add some random hashtags you found somewhere and hit post.

Then you wonder why engagement is low.

Here's what I realized: the problem isn't that you don't know what to say. The problem is that Instagram has its own rules—hooks that work, formatting that drives engagement, hashtag strategies that actually matter. And most of us are just winging it.

So I built a comprehensive prompt that turns ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Grok into a professional Instagram copywriter. Not the ""write me a caption"" kind that spits out cringe-worthy nonsense. This is a complete framework that covers everything from hook psychology to algorithm optimization.

## Why This Actually Helps

**Most people ask AI like this:**
""Write an Instagram caption about my coffee.""

**What they get:**
Generic fluff that sounds like every other Instagram post from 2019.

**This prompt is different because it's built on actual Instagram best practices:**

**1. Multiple Caption Structures**
- Educational content format
- Storytelling format
- Promotional format
- Community-building format

Each has a proven structure that works for different goals.

**2. Hook Strategies Built-In**
The first 125 characters matter (that's what shows before ""more""). The prompt includes 6 different hook strategies—questions, bold statements, storytelling openings, etc.

**3. Real Engagement Tactics**
Not just ""double tap if you agree."" Strategic CTAs that actually drive comments, saves, and shares—the things Instagram's algorithm cares about.

**4. Hashtag Strategy That Makes Sense**
The prompt teaches proper hashtag mix: large (100K-1M posts), medium (10K-100K), small (1K-10K), and branded. Plus guidance on where to put them.

**5. Quality Standards Checklist**
Before you post, you can verify everything: readability on mobile, emoji usage, line breaks, CTA effectiveness.

---

## What You Get

When you use this prompt, you receive:

✅ **3 Caption Versions**
- Primary recommendation
- Alternative angle/tone
- Shorter or longer variant

✅ **Complete Hashtag Strategy**
- Branded hashtags (1-2)

---

## Real Talk - What This Is

**What this IS:**
- A comprehensive framework based on Instagram best practices
- Templates for different content types
- A tool to speed up your workflow
- Free to use however you want

**What this is NOT:**
- A magic formula for viral posts
- A replacement for knowing your audience
- An excuse to post low-quality content
- A bot that will make you Instagram famous overnight

The truth: This gives you the structure. You still need to bring your brand voice, your knowledge of your audience, and genuine value. The prompt handles the technical optimization—you provide the substance.

## Optimization Checklist

Before finalizing your caption, verify:

- [ ] **First 125 characters** are compelling (shows before ""more"" button)
- [ ] **Paragraph breaks** every 2-3 lines for readability
- [ ] **Emojis** are relevant and enhance (not distract)
- [ ] **Hashtags** are current and not banned
- [ ] **CTA** is clear and specific
- [ ] **Brand voice** is consistent
- [ ] **Grammar** is flawless
- [ ] **Value** is immediately clear
- [ ] **Engagement trigger** is present
- [ ] **Mobile-friendly** formatting

## Performance Tips

### Boost Engagement
1. **Ask specific questions** (not yes/no)
2. **Create ""Save-worthy"" content** (tips, tutorials, lists)
3. **Use ""Tag a friend"" strategically**
4. **Post when your audience is active**
5. **Reply to all comments within first hour**
6. **Use Instagram features** (polls, questions in Stories)

### Algorithm Signals
- Comments > Likes > Saves > Shares (in order of importance)
- Time spent reading caption matters
- Early engagement (first 30 mins) is crucial
- Consistency signals quality to Instagram
- Authentic interaction beats generic comments

### A/B Testing Ideas
- Hook style (question vs. statement)
- Caption length (short vs. long)
- Emoji density
- CTA placement
- Hashtag count and placement
- Question type (open-ended vs. multiple choice)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Starting with boring/generic openings (""Hey guys!"")
❌ Being overly promotional without value
❌ Using irrelevant hashtags for reach
❌ Neglecting line breaks (wall of text)
❌ Forgetting call-to-action
❌ Inconsistent brand voice
❌ Too many emojis (emoji diarrhea)
❌ Not optimizing for mobile reading
❌ Copying competitors' exact style
❌ Ignoring current trends and cultural moments

## Additional Resources

### Caption Length Guide
- **Short (0-100 characters)**: Quick announcements, quotes, minimal context photos
- **Medium (100-500 characters)**: Standard posts, behind-the-scenes, casual content
- **Long (500-2000 characters)**: Stories, educational content, deep engagement posts

### Best Times to Post (General Guidelines)
- **Weekdays**: 6-9 AM, 12-2 PM, 5-7 PM
- **Weekends**: 9-11 AM, 5-7 PM
- **Note**: Always check your Instagram Insights for your specific audience

### Seasonal Considerations
Adjust tone and content for:
- Holidays and cultural celebrations
- Seasonal trends (summer vibes, cozy fall, etc.)
- Industry-specific events
- Current events (use discretion and sensitivity)

---

**Pro Tip**: Save your top-performing captions as templates, but always customize for authenticity. Instagram audiences can spot copy-paste content from a mile away.

**Remember**: Great captions convert browsers into engaged community members. Invest the time to craft them thoughtfully!

It makes me feel better pag may nilolookforward ako every week aside from working and being at school. 

My dilemma lang is, parang I feel so alone lately. Kapag yung friends ko nagyayaya gumala or mag coffee, andun ako kaagad. Lalo na nung time na broken yung friend ko kasi naghiwalay sila ng boyfriend nya, I would always check on her, call her, hang out with her and even accompanied her sa inuman kahit nag away na kami ng boyfriend ko. 

pero ngayun ang quiet kasi nagkabalikan na sila. nagyaya naman yung isa kong friend and game na game yung friend ko na kakagaling sa break up tapos nung ako yung nag yaya is hindi na naman sila available.

there are things I do alone naman like shopping or eating but I can't help but think sometimes na parang back up friend lang ako.

I have a boyfriend and he's not really into going out, he'd rather play all day kesa samahan ako sa mga gala ko. He would complain na pagod sya. We still hang out sa malalapit lang naman and he doesn't plan dates anymore which makes me a bit sad. 

wala lang, I feel like I always make myself available for these people. I would always say yes when they need me pero pag dating sakin ang hirap gawin.

I know I deserve to feel this way din kasi I gave too much of myself to these people. Kaya I'm trying to meet new people from Cebu who I share the same interest with. ",2,1761130435.0,OffMyChestPH,3,1.0,False

Not in the burnout sense. Not the sleep 3 hours and drink 6 Red Bulls, 10 cup of coffees, kind of mad. I mean the irrational kind of obsession that built the internet, the kind that makes founders keep going even when logic says stop.

we need a little madness , the kind that ignores trends, skips the metrics, data and predefined strategies.

1od4z2j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1od4z2j,My first pour over experience (kinda ruined and comparison with americano),"I ordered pour over for first time at cafe in Bangalore expecting to experience the process and setup on table and I was damn excited for that. All the other orders came but this was pending which added on to my excitement that the big reveal is kept for the end but alas the waiter came with a glass cup with black coffee in it. So I asked if that was my pour over and he confirmed to my disappointment. I told I was expecting the setup on table but anyway will enjoy the coffee. 
Please let me know if I was wrong in my expectations. 

Later just to do a head on comparison I ordered an americano as well.
So here's my newbie take:

Appearance: Americano had some Crema (pic 1) on top while pour over was shining flat (pic 2). 

Taste: Pour over was really smooth and mellow with a nice fruity taste and a refreshing acidic note with a pleasing aftertaste which remained as is throughout the cup. Americano had really toasty flavour with a punching bitter note and lingering dark aftertaste. After I finished half the cup, then the acidity started shining. 

Residue: No residue at all in pour over whereas Americano had some residue in the end (pic 3). 

I definitely enjoyed pour over more but would have really enjoyed brewing it myself a lot more. 
May be that's for another day. 
Please let me know if I got things right and if you have anything to add on here. 

PS- I asked the barista about beans and they told it's same beans i.e. same roast so I assume only the grind and brewing made all the difference. ",4,1761130321.0,IndiaCoffee,2,0.83,False

Everyone says it gives “Sherlock vibes,” but for me, it strangely reminded me of AMA Café in Majnu ka Tilla — warm, cozy, a little mysterious but inviting. There’s this café-hum essence that makes it feel nostalgic and modern at the same time.

Both are beautifully unisex, versatile, and have a personality of their own.

The packaging deserves a mention too — clean, classy, and thoughtfully designed. You can tell they pay attention to detail. On performance, both lasted about 3–4 hours on skin and 6 hours on clothes, which feels fair for niche-style compositions.

1od4sy5,https://i.redd.it/6nmj51tt6nwf1.jpeg,What Common Factors Are Pune Locals Ignoring That Are Leading to Type 2 Diabetes?,"Pune’s fast-paced lifestyle doesn’t exactly make it easy to stay healthy. Between work deadlines, late-night snacks, and endless cups of cutting chai, our habits are silently shaping our health. The shocking truth? More and more **Pune locals** are being diagnosed with *type 2 diabetes*, and most of them never saw it coming.

What’s worse — it’s not genetics or sugar alone that’s to blame. It’s the **everyday choices** people ignore. From skipping breakfast to sitting long hours, each of these adds up. According to health experts, timely lifestyle changes and regular check-ups with a [Diabetologist near me](https://g.co/kgs/oN1pPAG) can prevent the disease before it begins.

# So, What Common Factors Are Pune Locals Ignoring?

As **Dr. Satish Gupta** explains, type 2 diabetes doesn’t develop overnight. It’s a result of small but consistent health mistakes that accumulate over time. The sad part is — many of these factors are controllable. Yet, people ignore them until symptoms like fatigue, frequent urination, or excessive thirst appear.

If you’ve started noticing any of these, it’s time to take action and visit one of the most trusted specialists in **Aundh, Baner, Balewadi, Pashan, Bhavdhan, Pimpri Gaon, Pimpri Saudagar, Pimpri Nilakh**, and nearby areas — because early diagnosis can truly change the outcome.

# 1. Sedentary Lifestyle — The “Sitting Disease” of the Modern Worker

Pune’s IT crowd, corporate employees, and even college students are sitting for hours every day. This lack of movement leads to **insulin resistance**, where your body can’t properly use insulin to regulate blood sugar.

# How It Affects You:

* Muscles don’t use up glucose efficiently.
* Body fat (especially around the belly) increases.
* Metabolism slows down drastically.

# How to Fix It:

* Take short walking breaks every hour.
* Use standing desks or stretch between meetings.
* Include 30 minutes of brisk walking or yoga daily.

# 2. Skipping Breakfast and Eating Late Dinners

In Pune’s busy mornings, breakfast often gets replaced by caffeine. By night, heavy meals and late dinners follow — a double hit to your blood sugar levels.

# Why It Matters:

* Long fasting periods confuse your insulin response.
* Late-night eating causes glucose spikes while you sleep.
* Irregular eating patterns stress your pancreas.

# Simple Fix:

Eat a protein-rich breakfast within 1 hour of waking up. Keep dinners light and finish them 2 hours before bed.

# 3. Overconsumption of Processed Food and Sugar

The love for **vada pav, pav bhaji, and bakery snacks** runs deep in Pune — but these high-carb, high-fat foods are silent culprits. Add soft drinks, desserts, and sugary tea, and you’ve got a daily sugar overdose.

# The Real Damage:

* Causes constant blood sugar spikes.
* Increases fat storage, especially around vital organs.
* Leads to long-term insulin resistance.

# Better Alternatives:

* Swap refined flour for whole grains.
* Cut down on sugary beverages.
* Snack on nuts, fruits, or sprouts instead.

# 4. Stress and Lack of Sleep — The Invisible Triggers

Modern Pune runs on adrenaline — tight deadlines, traffic chaos, and never-ending multitasking. But stress releases **cortisol**, a hormone that raises blood sugar levels. Pair it with sleep deprivation, and your metabolism goes haywire.

# What Happens:

* Chronic stress reduces insulin sensitivity.
* Lack of sleep increases cravings for sugar and carbs.
* Mood swings and fatigue worsen blood sugar control.

# Quick Solutions:

* Practice mindfulness or meditation for 10 minutes daily.
* Aim for 7–8 hours of quality sleep.
* Disconnect from screens an hour before bed.

# 5. Ignoring Early Warning Signs

Most Pune locals dismiss early symptoms like frequent urination or tiredness as “just stress.” But these can be early indicators of rising blood sugar.

# Common Symptoms to Watch:

* Increased thirst or hunger
* Slow wound healing
* Tingling in hands or feet
* Blurred vision
* Unexplained weight changes

In the heart of Pune, [Dr. Satish Gupta,](https://g.co/kgs/oN1pPAG) a highly respected diabetologist, has been helping patients reverse and control diabetes through a scientific and personalized approach. With **years of expertise** and a deep understanding of lifestyle-driven diabetes, he offers guidance that goes beyond medicines — focusing on diet, activity, and stress management.

Dr. Gupta emphasizes that type 2 diabetes can often be **prevented or controlled** with early intervention. His holistic management methods combine modern treatment, regular monitoring, and patient education, helping individuals live healthier, medication-free lives.

# 6. Poor Hydration Habits

Many people underestimate the power of water. Dehydration increases sugar concentration in your bloodstream, making it harder for insulin to do its job.

# Tips to Stay Hydrated:

* Drink at least 2–3 liters of water daily.
* Avoid sugary juices and carbonated drinks.
* Infuse water with lemon or mint for better taste and detox benefits.



# 7. Lack of Regular Health Checkups

In Pune, many people only visit doctors when symptoms become severe. Regular checkups help detect *prediabetes* — a stage when lifestyle changes can completely reverse the condition.

# Recommended Screenings:

* **Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS)**
* **HbA1c Test** (for long-term glucose control)
* **Lipid Profile** (to check cholesterol balance)
* **Blood Pressure Monitoring**

Regular screening can identify risks early and prevent complications like nerve damage or heart disease.



# 8. Ignoring Family History

If diabetes runs in your family, you’re already at higher risk. But that doesn’t mean it’s inevitable — it just means you need to be more aware.

# Preventive Measures:

* Maintain a healthy weight.
* Stay active and monitor your blood sugar levels.
* Avoid smoking and limit alcohol.

Awareness, not fear, is your greatest weapon against hereditary diabetes.

# 9. Overdependence on Energy Drinks and Caffeine

Energy drinks, especially among Pune’s young working population, have become a quick fix for exhaustion. But these drinks are loaded with hidden sugars and caffeine that strain your pancreas.

# What You Can Do Instead:

* Replace energy drinks with coconut water or herbal tea.
* Limit coffee intake to 1–2 cups daily.
* Focus on good sleep instead of caffeine boosts.

# 10. Neglecting Weight Management

Even a slight increase in body fat — especially around the abdomen — increases your risk of developing insulin resistance.

# Smart Habits for Weight Control:

* Focus on portion control.
* Engage in strength training twice a week.
* Choose whole foods over processed ones.

# Final Thoughts — 

Type 2 diabetes isn’t just a “sugar problem”; it’s a lifestyle problem. The foods we eat, the hours we sit, and the stress we hold — all shape our risk. Pune locals often overlook these daily habits, but awareness is the key.",2,1761129743.0,Healthandlifetips,1,1.0,False

people use them for skin elasticity, joint support, and sometimes hair and nails. the research is
mixed, but there are solid studies showing improvements when taken consistently over a few
months.
[unflavored collagen](https://best.opinionativereviewer.com/DP-iLAZFJh) peptides are the
simplest version. they dissolve well in coffee, tea, or smoothies and don’t change the taste. that
makes them easy to stick with every day, which is the most important part.
multi collagen blends, like the one from [micro
ingredients](https://best.opinionativereviewer.com/DP-t8reF3h), mix different types of collagen
together. type i and iii are usually aimed at skin and hair, while type ii is more for joints. having
them all in one scoop can be useful if you want a broader approach instead of buying separate
products.
the main thing is consistency and dosage. most studies use around 10 grams a day, though the
serving sizes can vary by brand. it’s not an instant change, more something you notice gradually
after a couple of months.
they’re generally considered safe, but it’s worth checking the ingredient label if you have
allergies since some are sourced from bovine, fish, or [chicken.](https://github.io/)",1,1761129589.0,u_SuspiciousCoach7512,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Transitioned to those stick e-cigs with the screw on batteries.  Then the vape industry hit hard in the mid 2010s with building your own mods and filling tanks with juice. Even did those cloud competitions and vape tricks (stupid, I know) I was heavy into it and so were my friends. 

Then disposables came long. Flum pebbles, lost Mary, geek bars. Incredibly tasty and convenient. Crazy addicting. 

Then one day I looked down at my trash can. Saw 8 used disposables in there. It just looked like a sad sight for some reason. Such a waste of money. 

In August I saw a post about Desmoxan and how it helped someone quit. I quickly went to Amazon and bought it. Took 2 weeks to arrive. 

It was time. 

Once the package arrived. I opened it up and looked up instructions online. 5 tablets a day (one every 2 hours) and it was a 25 day supply. It recommended I continue to vape for 5 days while taking the pill. Cool, because I was down to my last geek bar so it was perfect. 

Took the pill and the only side effect was true. Lucid dreams. Like. LUCID. You remember everything. Oddly some of the best sleep of my life. 

Anyway. 15 days In, most nicotine cravings were gone. With the help of the occasional Zyn. If I really needed it

Now I’m at the 30 day mark. Completely nicotine free. No Zyns. No vapes. No cravings. 

Just black coffee. 

No more reaching for my vape first thing in the morning. 

No more trash cans filled with colorful disposables

I’m finally free

Growing up, my mom had a lot of dental issues, and that included bad breath. She was fully aware of it, but since we were financially incapable back then, she didn’t have the means to visit a dentist and just had to live with it.

That led me to develop anxiety, like “what if I have bad breath and nahihiya lang sila magsabi?” I’ve been constantly paranoid about my breath. Even when I have a lot to say in a conversation, I sometimes just keep my mouth shut because I’m scared people might smell my breath. 

I hate it! I invest a lot in my dental health. I floss every day, use a water flosser with mouthwash (since I have a dental bridge), brush 2–3 times a day, and dental cleaning twice a year. But just drinking coffee or juice can make my confidence drop instantly because the taste lingers, and I start thinking I stink!

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
