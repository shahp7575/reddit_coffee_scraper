My husband is super supportive and loving, im very well taken care of for context! I work 25 hours a week on my feet but im a super active person and have chose to be that active. I also walk my lab 2 miles per day (14 a week), and was a marathon runner prior to pregnancy. I‚Äôm doing what I can now but it‚Äôs not the same. 4 mile runs here and there and the gym are more wha it‚Äôs looking like. I‚Äôve gained around 12lbs and im somehow‚Ä¶. So miserable? like in my own skin. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù, I look huge already and people ask how im due in December. Recently, my energy has TANKED beyond belief, like no amount of sleep or coffee would help, I can barely make it through a day. Funny though because come nighttime I toss and turn and maybe sleep 3-4 hours. I just feel ‚Äúoff‚Äù 24-7 and idk what to do. I never had morning sickness, just intense hunger and I feel fatigued, like I can‚Äôt ‚Äúkeep up.‚Äù With others. 

Is there anything I can do? Does it sound mental, like im struggling with a new way of life? i miss being able to RUN, Walk, not be in any sort of discomfort or pain, or have a huge belly that feels like it has a 2 liter of sprite sitting in it at all times.

1mfp7n2,https://i.redd.it/eonsponrmlgf1.jpeg,Bad Mouse,"It all started on a sunny summer day in 2009 when three separate packages arrived on the doorsteps of the Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney studios. They were anonymous packages with no postmarks or return addresses. No one saw them being delivered, and each had only a simple note attached which read ‚ÄúI have created something I love. From me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù. Strange, but the recipients decided to humor the packages anyway, thinking it was fanmail or something of the sort. When they were opened, they revealed several video tapes.



They all had titles hastily scribbled on, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 1‚Äù, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 2‚Äù, and so on. There were 13 in total, the last of which had an additional notation reading ‚ÄúThis is the last‚Äù. As to the contents of the tapes, they contained what everyone assumed to be ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù, who was a mouse sock puppet, complete with two large ears, eyes, and buck teeth all clearly made with paper, but it had arms that were clearly stitched on in post and a cartoony tail that did not match the rest of the sock puppet.



All of the tapes were in black and white, and had very simple premises. In a high-pitched and nasally voice, Bad Mouse talked about numbers, the alphabet, animals, colors, and other really straightforward topics. They were only about four or five minutes long each, with no background music, title cards, or anything. Just Bad Mouse talking.



Nothing was too unusual or frightening about the ‚Äúshow‚Äù, so to speak. Clearly, it was done on a very low budget, but what exactly was the point of it? It surely would not entertain anyone over the age of three. Some dismissed it as some kind of stupid prank, while others joked that whoever delivered these tapes to the studios was banking on Bad Mouse being made into an actual show. Unfortunately, that was not how it worked, and after all the episodes were viewed and everyone got a good laugh at someone‚Äôs pitiful attempt at stardom, the episodes were all dismissed and promptly canned, though there were some who found Bad Mouse to be unsettling and creepy, but they would never bring that up in front of their colleagues.



That was supposed to be the end of it, but just one week later, more packages arrived, with the note now reading ‚ÄúFrom me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù, the ‚ÄúI have something I love‚Äù being notably omitted. Inside the packages were 13 tapes, just like last time, and when everyone gathered to watch them, they were actually surprised. While each episode was about the same length as before, the show actually had color, plots, music, title cards, more sock puppet characters, and environments, though it was still clearly made on the smallest ounce of a budget.



The visuals and effects were shoddy at best, whoever was voicing Bad Mouse clearly voiced the other sock puppet characters, there was a strange hum of static in the background, and occasionally a loud beeping noise came from out of nowhere and bloodied the ears of all who heard it. Needless to say, it was not nearly enough to convince the executives to even fathom the idea of greenlighting it, and Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network all tossed the tapes into the garbage.



‚ÄúBad Mouse is getting desperate!‚Äù a Nickelodeon executive quipped after sipping his coffee.



Was that the end of it? Everyone thought so until another week had passed and three more packages just bearing the words ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù arrived at each studio, and all three went straight to the trash can. However, a curious Cartoon Network intern secretly fished their package out of the trash. He had heard of Bad Mouse‚Äôs depravity from his colleagues, and as an avid collector of lost and unknown media on the side, this would be absolutely perfect for him. He took the tapes home and immediately popped them into his old VCR.



Judging by the small increase in quality in the second round of packages, the intern assumed that whoever was behind Bad Mouse had finally learned their lesson, but each tape showed a disturbing clip of the same thing: no color, no plots, no music, no title cards, no other characters, and no environments‚Ä¶just Bad Mouse sitting motionless and staring straight at the camera. Every thirty seconds or so, the sock puppet would say the words ‚ÄúGetting desperate‚Äù, but only in syllables:



‚ÄùGet‚Ä¶ting‚Ä¶des‚Ä¶per‚Ä¶ate‚Äù.



The intern did not scare too easily, and he did not think much of it other than it being pretty odd. Shrugging, he popped the tapes out of the old VCR, placed them with his other tapes and DVDs he had acquired throughout the years, and went to bed.



No more packages showed up after that. No more tapes. No more Bad Mouse. The whole ordeal seemed to be over‚Ä¶and it was. Until about a year later, when Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network‚Äôs channels were all hijacked.



By this point, everyone had basically forgotten about Bad Mouse. It was now just a fleeting memory of some desperate and depraved soul thinking they would make it big, something to bring up if you wanted to point and laugh. But the first signs of trouble were on Nickelodeon, specifically Nick Jr.



The characters Moose and Zee had in-between blocks where they provided information and education between shows. On the morning of July 12, 2010, a segment where Moose was supposed to teach the audience about names was hijacked by none other than Bad Mouse. In the middle of speaking, Moose went frozen and silent, the music cut out, and the screen glitched until Bad Mouse was there for the entire world to see.



Though no one watching at home could recognize what they were seeing, the network executives certainly did. Bad Mouse spoke to a bunny character (which was clearly just a stuffed animal and was aptly named ""Bunny"") about the importance of sharing. The mouse sock puppet ripped a toy truck out of Bunny's hands and ran away laughing, and Bunny just stood there, staring at the camera for about a minute. After that, it switched to a scene of Bad Mouse riding a little bike through a very poorly made cardboard field. A kindergarten play could create better sets than Bad Mouse ever could. He sang this song that sounded like complete nonsense in a voice that would make ears bleed.



""That petty asshole..."" said one network executive. It seemed that if they did not air Bad Mouse, then Bad Mouse was just going to do it themself.



The network executives were too embarrassed to simply power down the channel over what was definitely a stupid prank. They thought just slapping the technical difficulties screen on it would do the trick every time, but that did not stop Bad Mouse. For the next two weeks, all the shows on air were cut off and the broadcasts became a mess due to Bad Mouse jumbling everything up.



Bad Mouse would always return, just playing the same 13 crappy episodes on repeat. Calls were made by angry parents and their confused children, and each channel promised to resolve the issues, but they never could. While all three channels were determined to solve the issues, in the grand scheme of things, no one took them \*that\* seriously. They came off as more annoying than anything.



Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network made it absolutely clear that this was \*not\* their doing and that their broadcasts had been hijacked, and they did not know who it was or where it was coming from. With those statements out to linger in the air, the internet began to fill with rumors and speculation. Everyone was curious about the problems their children‚Äôs channels were having. There were still people assuming it was just a very clever prank and was the work of people who had nothing better to do but get a rise out of these channels and their viewers.



Others had‚Ä¶darker theories, many of them poked and made fun of for being just as stupid as Bad Mouse itself, ranging from Bad Mouse being the work of a disgruntled employee, an artificial intelligence, a paranormal phenomenon, aliens, or some kind of supernatural or superhuman entity. In today‚Äôs world, we are all pretty cynical and seem to disregard more dramatic notions because it does not align with our short-ordered view of reality.



Despite the many rumors, as July came to a close, things seemed to be getting better. By then, the executives at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney had found a way to block out all the messaging and instead broadcast either a default bumper or a continuous feed of static for the channels until they could figure out the issue. As a result, the hijackings had slowed down significantly. They defeated Bad Mouse.



By September 1st, there was no more hijackings at all, so it seemed that Bad Mouse had simply moved on to other things. Everyone was relieved, but there was still the occasional hushed murmur that whoever was behind these hijackings would be back, because clearly, Bad Mouse seemed like a persistent weirdo. Some even went so far as to say that Bad Mouse would bring violence with it, which was laughed off as completely and utterly ridiculous.



How very wrong those people were.



For a long time, there was nothing, like before. All of it was the calm before the storm, and boy, did it storm. 2011 was coming and going with nothing unusual happening. SpongeBob cooked Krabby Patties, Mickey Mouse took us on adventures around his clubhouse, and The Amazing World of Gumball was premiering its first season to massive success. Even the once active internet forums were completely empty, with Bad Mouse just being touted as a fun, if bizarre, little piece of lost media that was stuck in the past. All was well until the summer arrived‚Ä¶



There were so many more hijackings. All three networks were affected. Instead of just being Bad Mouse episodes, they were much more...disturbing. Each one lasted anywhere from 15 minutes to a full hour, depending on the severity, and each one was worse than the last. Beginning the same way, either flickering, frames repeating themselves, sound not syncing up, waving and jittering, or random pauses, something would always happen. Sometimes the screens would be replaced with deeply disturbing edits of whatever character was on screen, often making them appear angry at the audience.



Sometimes, the screen would fade into bloodied static for a few moments, then go right back to normal programming. Sometimes random images and videos would flash on the screen, such as a pictures of the White House on fire, footage of mice, someone walking outside at night, and random YouTube videos, but there was also disturbing imagery of people being tortured, mutilated, beheaded, people being shot at point-blank range, and even all manners of illegal pornography. Sometimes, an extremely loud beeping sound would bloody the ears of all who heard it (not unlike what was head in the first Bad Mouse video tapes), blocking out everything that was being said. Sometimes vague or threatening messages were displayed such as:



‚Äúi‚Äôm here‚Äù‚Äô



‚Äúis it getting desperate?‚Äù



‚Äúi hate you all‚Äù



‚Äúi have to get attention‚Äù



‚Äúi‚Äôm desperate!‚Äù



‚Äúyou love me, but I don‚Äôt love you‚Äù



‚Äúbad mouse is getting desperate!‚Äù



‚Äúi‚Äôm going to show you the world‚Äù



‚Äúbad mouse is getting worse!‚Äù



‚Äúme me me me me me‚Äù



‚Äúattention‚Äù



Some even claimed to see images of Bad Mouse himself in the background of scenes of terror and bloodshed, though those were usually not very clear. Occasionally, a clip of Bad Mouse would be shown and then just disappear. All of this was absolutely chilling, especially considering it was shown to young children, but it was far from over. During a hijacking of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on the morning of July 25, a message from Bad Mouse claimed that August 12 would be ‚Äúdeath day‚Äù. Everyone‚Äôs blood ran cold. What did Bad Mouse mean? No one could know, but the message was already out there, so everyone braced for the worst.



Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all in a panic. They cut all broadcasts, including off-air and live shows, and immediately called up their network technicians. To everyone‚Äôs horror, the technicians were unable to locate the origin of the hijackings. They could find no source, no one was even able to log in to the programming or mess with the technical equipment, and no technician was able to determine the cause. There was no foreign software or anything of the sort.



Security cameras showed no suspicious activity. Arguments ensued, fingers were pointed, hardworking employees were fired without warning, and the situation looked grimmer and grimmer. This was an all-out war, and no one knew why it was happening or how to stop it.



By August, the situation had spiraled out of control. It was no longer just a technical issue, but an outright attack on the three major children‚Äôs networks. The situation spiraled into full chaos, with Bad Mouse still unstoppable and the networks still in chaos. By now, all the technicians who were responsible for maintaining these networks and getting them up and running had been fired, leaving all the channel‚Äôs executives at a loss of what to do. All they could do was wait and see.



On August 12, the atmospheres at the three studios were tense. They made the conscious decision to stay open, not wishing to appear weak or stupid, and wanting to show Bad Mouse that they were not afraid of it. Their broadcasts of beloved children‚Äôs shows began as normal. For a while, everything actually seemed relatively normal. No hijackings happened yet, but just as everyone at the studios were beginning to think that they might be okay, something happened, a massacre of unimaginable brutality, a tragedy of such a scale that the world would never be the same again.



In a little over half an hour, six napalm bombs went off, two at each studio. In the blink of an eye, 115 people were dead and hundreds more were injured. They came out of nowhere, with no warning, and no way to tell who, what, or where they came from. One Nickelodeon employee, Mike Ewart, was speaking with a colleague near the front doors. One moment, she was laughing and smiling, sipping her Starbucks coffee, and the next, she was completely and utterly obliterated. Ewart said that ""it was like slow motion...I saw her body just vaporize. I felt her warmth just vanish. I felt her coffee splash on me. I was just numb.‚Äù



The police found a lone Bad Mouse sock puppet lying amongst the rubble at the Disney Studio, charred and damn near impossible to identify what it even was. That was all they had to go on for physical evidence besides the bombs themselves, which were found to be homemade devices filled with both black powder and a highly flammable petrochemical substance, both of which were placed in three-gallon plastic gas containers. Each one was placed in dense areas within each target to maximize the death toll.



A task force of hundreds of police officers from all over the country and federal agencies converged on all three studios. Thousands of leads were investigated, and they all came up empty. No one saw any suspicious activity at any time in any of the studios, and no one knew who could have or would have done such a horrific thing. FBI analysts even took a look at the original tapes, the ones that were rejected by the three studios, to see if there was something they missed. Still...nothing.



All three targets were devastated, but the Nickelodeon building received the greatest damage, with three fifths of the building destroyed. Much of the buildings were rendered uninhabitable by the immense heat and force of the explosions, and while they have since been repaired and remodeled, the damaged portions have been sealed off and turned into memorials.



The perpetrator behind Bad Mouse is a mystery. No suspects or leads were ever found. Clearly, they were a lunatic with an insane dream that they wanted to see realized, who wanted to make a big impact on the world. They went off the deep end when their show was rejected. Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney all closed for months after the incident and are still getting back on their feet today.



As time went on, people began to wonder why the networks would never make a statement on the incident. Many thought that maybe it would scare everyone away from watching their programming, but there's definitely more to it than that. Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all interviewed by the press, but they were extremely vague, simply saying that they were still working on ‚Äúa little something‚Äù to pay their respects to the victims and they never commented on Bad Mouse itself.



But the scars still exist. Bad Mouse is still burned into the minds of those who lived through it, and many are too afraid to talk about it or discuss the memories they have, but a few brave souls have come forward to share their experiences through interviews and documentaries. Even the intern was interviewed, though he wished to remain anonymous.



No one knows who Bad Mouse really is, and no one ever will. People have wanted to know more about the perpetrator of such a heinous crime. It was beyond obvious what their motivations were, but the question of whoever was encrypted as Bad Mouse, much like Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer, will simply never be known.

1mfp59s,https://i.redd.it/marepcehblgf1.png,-62 pounds!,"ok so i‚Äôve never actually posted about this before but figured it might help someone the way other posts helped me when i was just getting started. i‚Äôve been on sebora for 7 months now, started at 14st 11lbs and today i‚Äôm 10st 7lbs which still feels completely surreal to write. i‚Äôve been overweight since i was 14, tried every diet, every app, every influencer tip out there, nothing stuck longer than a few weeks. this has been the first time it actually felt... possible?

The first month i was nervous about the meds and had no idea what to expect. i‚Äôd heard people saying they ‚Äújust weren‚Äôt hungry‚Äù anymore and tbh i didn‚Äôt really believe it, but it actually hit me fast. not like zero appetite but more like food just... wasn‚Äôt screaming at me all day. i could work without thinking about snacks every 10 mins. that alone felt life-changing. i think i dropped like 11lbs right off the bat but what really shocked me was how calm my brain got around food.

Month 2 and 3 were when i started actually eating meals instead of just grazing all day. high protein breakfast helped a lot, and the sebora app had some good tips even tho i didn‚Äôt always follow it 100%. i stopped binging, like properly, for the first time in years. i didn‚Äôt even realise how often i was doing it until it stopped happening. clothes started fitting differently too but i didn‚Äôt want to get excited too soon, thought maybe it was just water weight

Month 4 i hit a bit of a dip, not emotionally but weight wise. scale barely moved and i felt a bit stuck, started doubting if it was working or if i was doing something wrong. old me would‚Äôve panicked and started cutting everything but instead i messaged sebora (shoutout to whoever writes their emails btw, they actually helped). added more fibre and volume food, less coffee (was overdoing that lol) and things picked up again after 2 weeks

By month 5 my skin started clearing up, my periods were getting regular again which blew my mind cause i‚Äôve had pcos since uni and nothing ever helped long-term. i also started moving a bit more, just walking mostly but it felt good to do something. also i went to a friend‚Äôs birthday and actually ate normally, didn‚Äôt restrict all day before or go crazy after. i just... existed. ate some cake, didn‚Äôt freak out, didn‚Äôt spiral. that was a big deal

Month 6 i went on a weekend trip with my partner and for the first time i didn‚Äôt cry trying on outfits. i didn‚Äôt feel small exactly, but i felt okay in my body, which is honestly all i ever wanted. he noticed too, not just the weight but that i was smiling more, showing up more. i started posting again on socials without filtering every pic 15 times. my energy came back in ways i didn‚Äôt even expect, like my brain was quieter and i could think clearer

Now it‚Äôs month 7 and i‚Äôm 10st 7lbs. haven‚Äôt binged in 6 months. haven‚Äôt cried about food in even longer. still have moments of fear like what if i gain it all back or what if this is too good to be true but mostly i just feel proud. not just cause of the weight but cause i stuck with it even on the slow weeks, even when i wanted to quit. sebora didn‚Äôt fix everything but it gave me the boost i needed to actually do this without burning out

If you‚Äôre thinking about starting, or if you‚Äôre in that weird middle place where progress is slow and self doubt kicks in, pls don‚Äôt give up. this isn‚Äôt a quick fix but it can be a real one. happy to answer anything if anyone has questions, promise to be honest.",1,1754137088.0,SeboraHealth,0,1.0,False

I'm left with a sick and disgusted feeling. His channel is nothing more than a hate channel that spreads drama and lies. There's nothing productive about it. If he wants to feed those 5 people on the canal then that should be done without sticking a camera in their faces. 

All he does on his channel is threaten lawsuits and to get the police after everyone; cries that he's perfect, everyone else is bad and wronged him, and he's disabled; begs for donations to go out to eat and drink expensive coffees with; have Angeluur creepily stare into the camera with a painted-on face as she talks with a very scary baby-voice that would only be pleasing to a psychopath and/or creep; and proves to us that he's obsessed with other people and other drivers (always mentioning what's on the back of trucks, or that he just opened the door for someone because ""it's the right thing to do""). 

I was astounded by his gaslighting:

1. He stated that he can't look at the chat because he's driving, but all he did was look at and respond to the chat as he was driving. 2. He constantly made digs about Taco Bell - as if he's too good for Taco Bell - but in reality he's a broke-ass loser living with his mother - that grifts and begs for money from poor, disabled, women who are desperate for one of his manipulative ‚ô•Ô∏è responses. And didn't he claim at one time that he managed a Taco Bell that happened to be owned by his amazing and successful family? 
3.  He claims that he doesn't want his channel to be about drama but his entire channel is about drama. 
4. He pretends to end that creepy Live on a positive note and states that he wants to do a panel with Sharon (or is it Sherry, I can't keep up with the insanity), and they're just going to say ""hello"" to their subscribers without the drama, but we all know that was a dramatic threat. 

That PsychoClown needs to leave people alone and get off of his awful channel. He creates nothing but a toxic and sick environment for the very few mentally-ill followers and enablers that he has left. If he stopped his nonstop raging, pathological lying, and playing the innocent victim with and about everyone that he interacts with for more than a few times (except for Angeluur; but something very sick about her - satiating and people-pleasing a psychopath when she should be working a real job), this would all end.

Me and my partner have been together nearly 9 months. It started great (as usual) but cracks started to show a few months in. My last relationship was very abusive so it‚Äôs taken a lot to let someone in and trust again. I feel there‚Äôs been lots of triggers on my side and in many ways he‚Äôs reminded me of my ex. A few weeks ago he tried to say I should try and get back with my ex husband (he was pre my abusive relationship) and this really hurt my feelings. I‚Äôve had my guards up since. 
Anyhow I have an ongoing pet peeve and I would like to know how other people navigate this. We don‚Äôt live together so he visits me often. When he comes he uses my oat milk and brown sugar to make coffee. He uses a lot. I drink tea but not as often. I always get more milk and sugar but I‚Äôm a single mum and I don‚Äôt like to shop often. He‚Äôs used up the sugar loads of times and not replaced it. The pot has been empty for a week. He comes today & comments that there‚Äôs still none. I said he could get some as it‚Äôs been all used up. He goes on to say he‚Äôll go to the shop to buy a coffee (Costa) I said he may as well get sugar and milk (as I only have 1 left) as it‚Äôll be cheaper. He says he‚Äôll bring some from home (he said this b4 & hasn‚Äôt happened) so I said he used up the last lot and it needs replacing. He then replies ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs like that is it, ‚ÄúI‚Äù need to replace it, oh right‚Äù. It was really awkward, so I said don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll get some next time I‚Äôm out, it‚Äôs just it goes a lot and so does the milk. He makes me feel like I‚Äôm taking the piss. But he eats my food when he‚Äôs here. Which is ok but I don‚Äôt know how to navigate it. How does everyone else deal with it. He is quite insecure and often says I don‚Äôt fancy him or he knows he annoys me, which I then start to over explain that it‚Äôs not true at all. I was all in until a few months ago and I can feel I‚Äôm distancing myself bcs of his comments and him predicting I‚Äôm thinking or feeling things I‚Äôm not. I hate it and I‚Äôve told him I don‚Äôt like it. He says he‚Äôll stop but is still doing it. The other day he ‚Äújoked‚Äù I was having affair which I‚Äôve said I don‚Äôt find funny (it‚Äôs not the first time) and he says he feels like I‚Äôm hiding things and don‚Äôt give him what he needs. I have my guards up as I‚Äôm waiting for something else. He‚Äôs upset me so many times and I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it. When we‚Äôre good we get on great, same interests and sense of humour but I‚Äôm on edge so don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôm being myself anymore.

I work as an barista at a small coffee shop in the city we live in and he‚Äôs studying engineering,

things have been good, amazing even and it feels like I‚Äôm living in a dream, but i can‚Äôt keep living likely this

See me and my husband met when I was a junior in high school and he was a freshman in college, some people would see it as problematic but we didn‚Äôt start dating till I was 19 and he was 22 three year age gap not a big deal,

Okay sorry getting off topic, the problem is how we met was his sister I‚Äôll call her Emma. Me and Emma met when her family moved in our sophomore year she was gorgeous, stunning. She was a hit in our grade mostly because she was pretty and the other half being our school didn‚Äôt get much transfers

She was like eye candy for me but I never really talked with her until we got paired up for a history project i can‚Äôt remember what it was about but she was so kinda to me she had like this warmth that consumed me whole 

The project was stupid, but we become close then we bonded over our love for sublime and slasher films it was an instant connection, like everything clicked around that time we hung out at her place a lot her parents were a bit scary but overall sweet once they liked you.

But alone with her parents was her brother this tall pretty boy aka my ‚Äúhusband‚Äù I‚Äôll call him Ethan,

Ethan was kinda alt and geeky but we didn‚Äôt talk much it was sorta a your best friend and her hot older brother type of situation.

I would joke around with Emma about it I was just fucking with her but she would get this look I never understood, until one day we were in her room her parents were out and Ethan was probably out drunk she put on a movie in the background while we where just chatting about anything really

But one of the scenes showed a cheerleader being love with one of her teammates and she was singing the song I wanna hold your hand and she got that same look I can‚Äôt remember her exact words but it was something along the lines of ‚Äúdo you really think people could live like that‚Äù 

Okay typing it out makes her sound bad but it was in like a soft confusing voice and I just stared at her and I said before we clicked but that‚Äôs when we really clicked and that night she kissed me it was weird, at the time it was ok but people weren‚Äôt so open?

I didn‚Äôt know how to feel at the time so I pulled back I wouldn‚Äôt say I was homophobic but it was like an instinct, I made a up reason to leave but she kept calling me but I was so overwhelmed and honestly I was a moron 

But everything came to a head when I went to a school event at this pop up fair and she found me and that‚Äôs when I fucked things up for read I was heavily emotional and kinda intoxicated

We had an argument that ended up with her cussing and me screaming that I loved her but I just want to be normal

And that was it we didn‚Äôt talk at school stoped coming over to her house I felt lonely and that‚Äôs when I met Ethan again

When I 18 worked part time at a grocery store think Walmart or target but smaller and less popular, I was working at the deli stand when Ethan came up we reconnected and i don‚Äôt know what i was thinking but something about him kept reminding me of his sister they had the same eyes and nose but he was missing her cute dimples and he talked different but it was enough to bring me back to her and a year after that we started dating 

It was awkward seeing her when we went over to see his family but their parents approved of me so he proposed last year and now we‚Äôre here

I work at a cafe supporting not just myself but my husband while his parents pay for his college and I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can take this he always asked why me and Emma seem tense when we were such good friends in high school like what am I supposed to say 

‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt know Ethen maybe it‚Äôs because I fell inlove with your sister then made out with her only to be inadvertently homophobic, not just to her but to myself and leave her crying by the popcorn stand!?‚Äù 

Yeah I just don‚Äôt know what to do how I‚Äôm explaining what I did to Emma just seems so hollow? I‚Äôm not good at writing emotions it seems so dry but I swear there was emotion tension and there still is but my life is weird right now I‚Äôm just living I guess.",1,1754136692.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

It seems most people have a preference of one of these games over the other.  I thought it would be interesting find out why a person may prefer one of games over the other?

For me, the setup time for TL along with a 2-4 hr play time makes it somewhat less desirable than ATA.  I do like the all the variability
one has in equipment (and commanders) when choosing their battalion cards in TL.

I think having a single tank with crew is more personal (""narrative"") than a set of battalions of vehicles and equipment.  Also, the 15-45 minute playtime for ATA makes it a preferred early morning  game that I usually have on the coffee table in the morning while waking-up and drinking coffee.

I have a number of ""Leader"" series games but haven't opened one in about a year.  I think ATA is one of the few games I have that I can play in under an hour whereas I have a plethora of games like TL that play in 2-4 hrs so it becomes a little harder of a choice (do I play TL this evening or ""Pavlov's House"", or ""Stalingrad, Advance to the Volga""?)

I enjoy both games but the time involved and game length of TL means I take ATA off the shelf more frequently than TL.

After a weekend of hacking and way too much coffee, here‚Äôs what came out:¬†NitroQR.com.

How it works:  
You generate a QR. If someone scans it up close, they see link A. If they scan from farther away (like across a room), they get link B. All just using their phone‚Äôs native camera. No custom apps or browser requirements involved.

Tech behind it:  
I dug into multi-code patterns and some clever visual encoding tricks to nudge the built-in computer vision on regular devices. Both ‚Äúnear‚Äù and ‚Äúfar‚Äù are just regular QR code payloads, but the phone naturally picks up on one or the other depending on the level of detail. Everything‚Äôs generated as a static image‚Äîno cloud hooks, no data capture, just pixels.

Why though?

* For product creators: Give specs up close, push for a purchase from a distance.
* Event folks: Show agenda nearby, take people to RSVP from the back of the hall.
* Artists, educators, meme nerds‚Ä¶ there are wild use cases if you‚Äôre into experience design.

Contextual awareness to highlight different aspects of the content when the page loads.

The code is static, so privacy is a non-issue. The generator is live at NitroQR.com. You drop in two links or strings, and boom‚Äîcustom dual-purpose code you can print or slap online. Does have a simple limitation, needs a little padding and a light background to maintain the already very delicate payload integrity.

Would love feedback from devs and hackers here!

Try it free, no login needed. If you build something on top or figure out a clever hack, please show it off! This might just be the weirdest side-project I‚Äôve shipped all year.

My resignation letter officially landed on Mr. Henderson's expensive mahogany desk, putting a ruthless period on years of being Ethan Cole's secret convenience.  
  
But freedom was fleeting.  
  
Isabella, his fianc√©e and my tormentor, summoned me to Ethan's TriBeCa penthouse, wielding an old, whimsical sketch of mine like a weapon, then slapped me clean across the face.  
  
Ethan arrived, and instead of defending me, he smoothed Isabella's perfect, glistening fake tears, dismissing me as someone who  ""meant nothing"" -just  ""a release.""   
  
Emboldened, Isabella snatched my portfolio, spilling my architectural dreams-designs for community centers-and pouring red w\*\*e directly onto them, staining my future crimson.  
  
Ethan then tossed a wad of cash at my feet, his voice flat:  ""For the dry cleaning. Now get out.""   
  
I stumbled out into the New York downpour, each raindrop a tiny hammer pounding home the gut-wrenching humiliation of being so utterly worthless to the man I'd loved.  
  
How could he, the center of my naive world, watch as my dignity and dreams were drowned in w\*\*e, then casually toss money as if I were a broken possession?  
  
But in that deepest moment of despair, something snapped.  
  
I was done being their discarded convenience, their emotional punching bag; I would disappear and rebuild a life where my peace wasn't for sale, no matter what it took.  
  
  
Chapter 1  
The click of my pen on the resignation letter was the loudest sound in my head.  
  
It was done, a period at the end of a long, messy sentence I'd lived for years.  
  
Freedom felt heavy, like a bag I wasn't sure I could carry.  
  
I walked through the open-plan office of Cole & Vance Global, my heels quiet on the plush carpet.  
  
Polished wood, gleaming steel, the scent of expensive coffee ‚Äì it was a world I'd once desperately wanted.  
  
Now, I just wanted out.  
  
I placed the letter on Mr. Henderson's expensive mahogany desk in HR.  
  
He'd understand, or he wouldn't. It didn't matter anymore.  
  
Back in my small Queens apartment, the city noise felt familiar, a rough comfort.  
  
I called Mom.  
  
""I did it, Mom. I quit.""  
  
Her sigh came through the phone, a wave of relief.  
  
""Oh, Mia, thank God. Finally.""  
  
""I know.""  
  
""That boy, Ethan... he was never good for you. All that money, that family... it's a different world, baby.""  
  
""You need to find a good man, Mia. Someone from around here, someone decent. Someone who'll treat you right.""  
  
""I will, Mom,"" I said, my voice even, betraying none of the exhaustion coiling in my stomach.  
  
""I just need some time.""  
  
We talked a little more, her voice a soothing balm.  
  
I promised to visit, to eat her cooking.  
  
Hanging up, I sank onto my worn sofa. Time. What I needed was an ocean of it.  
  
My phone buzzed on the coffee table.  
  
A new text. Unknown number, but the tone was unmistakable.  
  
Ethan's penthouse. Now. Don't be late. - I.  
  
Isabella. Of course.  
  
My stomach tightened.  
  
Conditioned reflex. Years of it.  
  
I stood up.  
  
The Uber ride to TriBeCa was a blur of city lights.  
  
Ethan's building loomed, all glass and arrogance.  
  
The doorman, uniformed and impassive, recognized me. A slight nod. He'd seen me come and go enough times.  
  
The private elevator whisked me up, silent and fast.  
  
It opened directly into the penthouse.  
  
Cool marble underfoot, a cavernous space overlooking the city.  
  
And Isabella, standing by the floor-to-ceiling windows, a silhouette against the glittering skyline.  
  
She turned, a slow, deliberate movement.  
  
Her smile didn't reach her eyes.  
  
""Amelia. So glad you could make it.""  
  
She gestured to a low glass table.  
  
On it, a single sheet of paper. A sketch.  
  
My sketch.  
  
A small, whimsical design for a tiny park bench, shaped like a curled-up cat.  
  
I'd drawn it for Ethan years ago, back at Columbia, before... before everything.  
  
""Still trying to leave your little marks everywhere, aren't you?"" Isabella's voice was smooth, like poisoned honey.  
  
""Trying to remind him of what you think you had?""  
  
""That's old, Isabella,"" I said, my voice quiet but firm. ""Years old.""  
  
""Is it?"" She picked it up, her perfectly manicured nails tapping the edge.  
  
""Or is it a desperate little plea? A reminder that you're still... available?""  
  
Her eyes raked over me, from my sensible shoes to my slightly frayed jacket.  
  
""You just don't fit, do you, Mia? Working-class girl from Queens, trying to play in the big leagues.""  
  
""You think your little scholarship and your... sketches... make you special?""  
  
The words were meant to hurt, and they did, a dull ache starting behind my ribs.  
  
""I'm not trying to play anything,"" I said. ""I just resigned today.""  
  
""Oh, I heard,"" she purred, stepping closer. ""Running away?""  
  
""No. Moving on.""  
  
""Ethan is mine, Mia. He was always mine. You were just... a distraction. A temporary convenience.""  
  
Then, her hand moved, a flash of speed.  
  
Her palm connected with my cheek.  
  
A sharp, stinging pain.  
  
My head snapped back.  
  
I touched my face, the skin already hot.  
  
My eyes met hers. For a second, something in me wanted to lurch forward, to fight back.  
  
But the years of their games, their power, held me rooted.  
  
A tiny spark of defiance flickered. I straightened, not backing down.  
  
""Don't touch me again, Isabella.""  
  
The elevator doors slid open.  
  
Ethan.  
  
He stood there, tall, impeccably dressed in a dark suit, his expression unreadable, cold.  
  
His eyes flicked from me to Isabella, then back to me, lingering on my cheek.  
  
He moved then, not towards me, but to Isabella.  
  
He gently took her arm, his body shielding hers slightly.  
  
""Bella, what's going on?"" His voice was low, controlled.  
  
He barely glanced at me, as if I were a piece of furniture slightly out of place.  
  
Isabella's face crumpled.  
  
Tears welled in her eyes, perfect, glistening tears.  
  
""Ethan, she... she came here to cause trouble! She's been leaving things, trying to get to you!""  
  
She held up the sketch like it was damning evidence.  
  
""She's obsessed! She attacked me when I told her to leave you alone!""  
  
""That's not true,"" I started, my voice shaking a little despite myself. ""Ethan, that sketch is from-""  
  
""Mia.""  
  
His voice cut through mine, sharp and final.  
  
""Not now.""  
  
He turned his full attention to Isabella, his expression softening as he looked at her.  
  
He brushed a tear from her cheek with his thumb.  
  
""Bella, darling, you know she means nothing to me.""  
  
His voice was a c\*\*ess for Isabella, a blade for me.  
  
""She never did. It was just... a release. You know that.""  
  
He didn't even look at me when he said it.  
  
A release.  
  
Like an itch scratched. A pressure relieved.  
  
The words hit me harder than Isabella's slap.  
  
My carefully constructed composure, the fragile shell I'd built around my resignation, cracked.  
  
The floor seemed to tilt.  
  
He thought I was nothing. After all this time, all these years, I was just... nothing.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
Isabella, emboldened by Ethan's dismissal of me, pressed her advantage.  
  
Her eyes, still wet with those fake tears, fixed on Ethan.  
  
""Prove it, Ethan. Prove she means nothing.""  
  
Her voice was a childish whine, but her eyes held a glint of steel.  
  
She wanted more than his words. She wanted a sacrifice.  
  
I clutched my bag, my knuckles white.  
  
My portfolio was inside. My resignation letter, yes, but also my personal designs.  
  
Concepts for community centers, sustainable housing. My real work. My hope.  
  
Isabella's gaze flicked to my bag.  
  
A cruel smile touched her lips.  
  
""What's in there, Mia? More little love notes for Ethan? More pathetic attempts to impress him?""  
  
Before I could react, she snatched the bag from my shoulder.  
  
The contents spilled onto the expensive Persian rug.  
  
My carefully rendered drawings, my notes, scattered like fallen leaves.  
  
My copy of the resignation letter lay starkly white against the deep red of the rug.  
  
""Oh, look,"" Isabella cooed, picking up a sketch of a small library for a low-income neighborhood. ""How... quaint. Trying to save the world, are we, Mia?""  
  
She held it up for Ethan to see, her expression mocking.  
  
Ethan just watched, his face a mask of indifference.  
  
""Isabella, that's enough,"" he said, but there was no force in his voice.  
  
""Is it, Ethan?"" she challenged, her eyes flashing. ""Or do you secretly admire her little... projects?""  
  
She let the sketch flutter from her fingers.  
  
Then, as if in slow motion, she reached for a nearby crystal glass of red w\*\*e.  
  
With a small, theatrical g\*\*p of ""Oops!"", she tilted it.  
  
The dark liquid arced through the air, splashing across my white blouse, drenching my scattered designs.  
  
A deep crimson stain bloomed on the paper, bleeding into my intricate lines, obscuring my careful lettering.  
  
My work. My future. Ruined.  
  
A choked sound escaped me.  
  
Ethan finally moved. He stepped forward, not to help me, but to survey the damage.  
  
He looked at the w\*\*e-soaked papers, then at my stained blouse, his expression one of faint distaste.  
  
""Clean it up, Mia,"" he said, his voice flat.  
  
""And then get out.""  
  
He reached into his pocket, pulled out a wad of cash, and tossed a few hundred-dollar bills onto the stained rug.  
  
""For the dry cleaning.""  
  
The insult was clear, a final, contemptuous dismissal.  
  
My heart shattered into a million tiny pieces.  
  
I couldn't breathe. Couldn't think.  
  
I turned and fled.  
  
Out of the penthouse, into the waiting elevator, away from their cruelty.  
  
The elevator doors opened onto the silent, opulent lobby.  
  
I stumbled out, tears blurring my vision.  
  
The doorman looked away, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes.  
  
I burst out of the building, into the sudden, sheeting rain of a New York downpour.  
  
The cold water plastered my hair to my face, soaked through my ruined blouse, but I barely felt it.  
  
Each drop was a tiny hammer, pounding home the humiliation.  
  
Years. I had given years of my life, my heart, my talent, to Ethan.  
  
I remembered him at Columbia ‚Äì charming, brilliant, a little reckless.  
  
He'd been drawn to my quiet intensity, my different perspective. Or so I'd thought.  
  
Isabella was there too, of course. Rich, beautiful, popular.  
  
She'd befriended me, a seemingly kind gesture.  
  
I'd been naive, flattered by her attention.  
  
I saw now that I was just a foil, a less shiny object to make her sparkle brighter.  
  
Ethan had pursued Isabella, and I, fool that I was, had helped him.  
  
I'd listened to his worries, offered advice, all while secretly, hopelessly, in love with him.  
  
When Isabella had abruptly left him for a European adventure, he'd been devastated.  
  
And I had been there.  
  
I picked up the pieces. I became his assistant, his confidante, his shadow.  
  
I managed his life, his work, with meticulous care.  
  
Then, one night, drunk and despairing, he'd reached for me.  
  
It wasn't love. It was need, a desperate grasping in the dark.  
  
I knew it. But I'd hoped.  
  
That was the beginning of our ""arrangement.""  
  
His needs met, my hopes flickering.  
  
For three years, it had been like that.  
  
His convenient comfort when Isabella was away or when they fought.  
  
Then Isabella returned, and just like that, I was discarded.  
  
He'd gone back to her without a second thought.  
  
That's when I'd finally written the resignation letter.  
  
That's what led me here, sobbing in a New York City downpour, my professional dreams stained red, his carelessly tossed money probably dissolving in my pocket.  
  
He knew. He'd always known how I felt.  
  
His words, ""a release,"" echoed in my mind, a cruel confirmation of my insignificance.  
  
My peace wasn't for sale. My dignity wasn't his to soil.  
  
I stumbled on, the rain washing away my tears, or maybe just adding to them.  
  
I had to get away. I had to.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
My last month at Cole & Vance Global was a special kind of h\*ll.  
  
Ethan avoided me, a wall of icy professionalism between us.  
  
But Isabella made sure I suffered.  
  
She'd swan into the office, all designer clothes and condescending smiles.  
  
She'd pause by my drafting table, her eyes scanning my work.  
  
""Still at it, Mia? Don't you get tired of these... little buildings?""  
  
Her voice, pitched just loud enough for nearby colleagues to hear, dripped with disdain.  
  
Sometimes she'd ""accidentally"" bump my table, jostling my pens, or ""borrow"" a specific reference book she knew I needed, only to return it days later, coffee-stained.  
  
Ethan never intervened. He'd either be ""in a meeting"" or would simply look the other way, a silent accomplice to her petty cruelties.  
  
My colleagues, sensing the shift in power, kept their distance. Whispers followed me down hallways.  
  
I kept my head down, counting the days.  
  
One afternoon, Isabella found me reviewing the plans for a small community center I'd designed in my spare time ‚Äì one of the few pieces that had mostly escaped the w\*\*e disaster.  
  
It was an innovative design, focused on sustainability and shared spaces. I was proud of it.  
  
She picked it up, feigning interest.  
  
""This is... ambitious, Mia. For you.""  
  
A pause. ""You know, Ethan's family is hosting their annual charity gala next week. Very high profile. All the big names in development and architecture will be there.""  
  
She tapped the design. ""Perhaps you could present this? As a sort of... farewell. A chance to impress potential employers.""  
  
Her smile was too bright, her eyes too knowing.  
  
It felt like a trap.  
  
But my contract had a nasty clause about leaving early without ""significant cause or mutual agreement.""  
  
My resignation wasn't fully processed yet, and I was desperate to be free.  
  
This gala, if I made a good impression, could be my ticket out, a way to find a new job quickly.  
  
""I... I'll think about it,"" I said.  
  
""Don't think too long,"" Isabella said sweetly. ""Opportunities like this don't come often for people like you.""  
  
Reluctantly, I agreed. What other choice did I have?  
  
The night of the gala arrived. The ballroom glittered with chandeliers and old money.  
  
I wore my best, but still felt like an imposter among the couture gowns and tailored tuxedos.  
  
My hands trembled as I set up my presentation. This was it. My one shot.  
  
Mrs. Vance, Isabella's mother, gave a brief introduction, her voice dripping with false warmth as she mentioned my ""promising talent.""  
  
I stepped up to the podium, my heart pounding.  
  
""Good evening. My design is for a community center that...""  
  
I clicked the remote for the first slide.  
  
My design, the carefully rendered exterior, should have appeared.  
  
Instead, a picture flashed onto the huge screen behind me.  
  
A picture of me from college. Awkward, frizzy-haired, at some frat party, a red plastic cup in my hand.  
  
Laughter rippled through the room.  
  
My face burned. I fumbled with the remote.  
  
Click.  
  
Another photo. Me, tear-streaked, after a fight with Ethan, years ago. A private moment he'd captured, now public.  
  
Click.  
  
More photos, each one more mortifying than the last. Awkward moments, silly faces, interspersed with cruel, childish captions: ""Future Architect?"" ""Needs a Makeover!"" ""Always the Bridesmaid!""  
  
The titters grew louder. I could feel hundreds of eyes on me, dissecting my humiliation.  
  
This was Isabella's doing. And Ethan... Ethan had given her these photos. Years ago, he'd said he deleted them.  
  
He stood near the front, his face a carefully blank mask, but I saw the slight tightening of his jaw. He knew. He'd allowed this.  
  
I wanted the floor to swallow me whole.  
  
Security guards materialized at my elbow, their faces grim.  
  
""Ma'am, you need to come with us.""  
  
They escorted me out, a pariah, the laughter of the elite echoing behind me.  
  
I was dumped unceremoniously into a service corridor.  
  
I leaned against the cool wall, gasping for breath, shame and anger warring within me.  
  
A kind voice startled me. ""Are you alright?""  
  
I looked up. A man in a simple suit, his name tag reading ""Dr. Noah Miller - ER Volunteer.""  
  
His eyes were gentle, concerned. He'd seen what happened.  
  
""They can be cruel,"" he said softly.  
  
He offered me a bottle of water, a quiet place in a small office to compose myself.  
  
He didn't ask questions, didn't pry. He just showed simple, human kindness.  
  
Later, he drove me home to Queens, the silence in the car a blessed relief.  
  
His unexpected compassion was a tiny light in a vast darkness.

""Ella, get the hell up before were late.""My obnoxious roommate Nate knocked on my door to wake me up for work.  
  
I groggily murmur, ""Mm, five more minutes.""  
  
""Hm."" I groaned back, and he laughed, ""You'd die without me in your life, Ella."" We need to get to the office quickly before the CEO, the hot Daniel Olivia, reprimands us. Nate hummed amusingly.   
  
After we received our undergraduate degrees, Nate and I moved in together. We have a cute modest flat in Manhattan's streets. We were employed as interns at Olivia Global over a year ago with the expectation of being shortly promoted to full-time employees.  
  
My roommate Nate is also my best buddy in the entire world. No, this isn't one of those sappy romance books where the lady secretly loves her best friend and he feels the same way. Nate isn't attracted to women sexually. When we first met, I'll admit that I was a little disappointed to learn that Nate was gay. But hey, I still adore the dork.  
  
\*\*  
  
As soon as I exited the elevator, I noticed all of my other students hurrying about and appearing to be focused on the specific assignment that Mr. Olivia had assigned.  
  
Nate alerted me about the upcoming board meeting before I could enter my tiny office, and I appreciate him for doing so. I carried the papers into the tiny room I use for my office and grabbed my MacBook Pro so I could make notes. We sped over to the boardroom.  
  
While we waited for Mr. Olivia, I opened Microsoft Word on my Mac and created a blank page so that I could make any necessary notes.  
  
I was sipping my coffee and listening to Nate chat about this handsome guy he met at Starbucks the other day when the goddess herself entered the board room through the large, dark doors. Mr. Olivia was attired in a dark blue tie, a tailored white dress shirt, and a grey suit. His hair was fashioned in a David Beckham-inspired jellied back look, which I simply wanted to run my fingers over.  
  
Every lady in the room, including Nate and I, virtually swooned at the young Chief in editor. His shoulders were drawn back in a confident manner as he walked, his jaw clinched to show off his exquisite jaw structure and his eyes glared ahead of him. I got up and fixed my clothes as he moved to his seat. I then approached him, pulled out his seat, and placed his customary coffee in front of him.  
  
Mr. Olivia's perpetually somber expression brightened as he acknowledged my gifts. I stepped out from behind the chair to sit next to Nate as he grinned and sat down.  
  
He warmly smiled at me and said, ""Well, well, well, if isn't my trusty little intern.""   
  
When he called me by my name, I flushed and looked down at my lap.  
  
With the icy CEO's expression returning to his immaculate face, Mr. Daniel Olivia demands in a stern voice, ""Alright, everyone settle into your seats, please."" We must calm down and talk over everyone's monthly assignments.  
  
Around the room, there was muttering about their upcoming tasks. He commanded, ""Quiet down."" Everyone in the room grew silent and returned their focus to Mr. Daniel Olivia. Now go ahead and shoot me some ideas folks, what do you all have for me? ""Now everybody shoot out some of your ideas and if I like it I'll assign it to you or give it to somebody else who I think can handle the job better.""  
  
A few people rushed to express their thoughts because they were keen for Mr. Olivia's approval. He found some of their ideas to be impressive, others to be repulsive, and some he just didn't like. He gave the majority of them jobs as they screamed out.  
  
Daniel was looking for a compelling story to include in this month's edition because our company Greyson Global also operated as a magazine. So yet, none of them had made an impression on him. Until the biggest b\*tch in our Greyson Global crew started talking.  
  
God I loathe the sound of her voice, ""Why don't we set up an interview with Mr. Woods, Mr. Olivia?""  
  
  
Chapter2  
The inquiry caught Daniel off aback, but he soon recovered with a scoff and a shake of the head. Why would he choose us since he doesn't do interviews to any publications or anyone else for that matter?  
  
I timidly inquire, ""Who's Mr. Woods?""  
  
On the other end of the table, Mr. Olivia's mother was occupying a seat, and I'm not sure how I missed her. She raised her voice and gave me a blunt explanation of who he is. I've always been afraid of ladies. It's fair to say that Mr. Woods wasn't the friendliest guy around, based on what I've heard and learned.  
  
After reading her critical biography of Mr. Woods, I remark, ""Oh okay,"" trembling and gently.  
  
I gave Emily a ""what the are you smirking about"" look as she grinned at me. She gave me a wink before turning to face Mrs. Olivia, who admired Ashely and her concepts. Pfft, you sucka.  
  
She questioned Mrs. Olivia, ""Why don't we get Isabella to try getting an interview with him?""  
  
She smirked and continued, ""Well, I think that since she wants to move from her position as an intern she will do anything to get to where she wants to be in this business. She is one of our hardest workers and I can't see anybody better than her for the job. Therefore, I think she should be the one to interview Mr. Woods.  
  
Daniel yelled at them, ""She won't be doing that at all!""   
  
Mrs. Olivia, hoping to provoke her handsome son, asks him, a phony smile flickering across her Botox face, ""And why not, my son?""  
  
He answers sharply, ""Because she's my intern and I don't think she's ready to take on a challenge just yet like interviewing a mean bastard like Mr. Woods.""  
  
She gave him a mocking smile, ""Aw, well, aren't you sweet to look out for your little intern.""  
  
Emily's irritating voice joins in, ""Mr. Olivia?"" Have you seen a decline in our ratings recently?  
  
He asks with sarcasm seeping from every syllable, ""No Emily, of course I don't know how my company's doing, after all, what kind of boss would keep up with such information.""  
  
We were all chuckling at Daniel's snarky remark when her jaw suddenly locks, but she forces a phony smile back onto her face. intelligence, good appearance, and humor. Wow, he's so ideal.  
  
She turns and cozies up to Mrs. Olivia knowing that Daniel is simply too intelligent for her and that she can always get her way by brain-f\*cking Mrs. Olivia. Simply put, ""I'm just saying we really need something to get us back our ratings and that will interest our readers.""  
  
Mrs. Olivia hums, ""Hmm."" We really need to attract our readers back and have a story ready for them that will genuinely engage them, so you make a good point.  
  
Everyone is staring at me while I fiddle with my pen. When I sense that everyone in the room is staring at me, I slowly turn to face their menacing glares.  
  
I sigh and turn to face Mrs. Olivia. ""M-Me?""  
  
She snaps mockingly, ""You slow child, yes you. What's your name?""  
  
""I'm Isabella Jones, that's me.""  
  
She replies, raising her perfectly plucky eyebrow, ""Well Isabella, you're going to try and get an interview with Mr. Woods as your job for this month, understand?""  
  
I took a sip and nodded.  
  
""You, Isabella,"" She asks commandingly again, that goddamn eyebrow arched, ""Isabella, you will email Mr. Woods and request an interview. If he denies the email, then you try harder to catch his attention.  
  
""Yes.""  
  
She hissed, ""Yes what?""  
  
The answer is ""yes, Mrs. Olivia.""  
  
She huffs and pulls her pricey Louis Vuitton bags up with her as she stands up from her seat. She smirks mockingly at me and says, ""Good luck. I'd like to be informed with his response.""  
  
Before Ashely follows Mrs. Olivia out the door, she stops at the door. She chuckles, ""I can't wait to see you fail this. ""Wow, that was smart of me to suggest such a great idea, huh?""  
  
I struggle to restrain myself from scratching this woman..  
  
  
Chapter3  
When Nate and I got back to the office. ""Okay. As soon as we sit down at our workstations, Nate says, ""First things first. ""He's a f\*\*king babe!""  
  
Daniel Olivia? Goddamn, I'm right.  
  
He giggles, ""No you fool- well yes, but we weren't discussing that wonderful specimen at the moment. ""I'm referencing Robert Woods. The guy appears to have been gently and flawlessly sculpted by Greek gods.  
  
I chuckle and take a sip of my coffee. ""You're obviously over exaggerating,"" I say.  
  
I squint and take a second drink of coffee. I spit it out all over my black flats before I could even swallow it. Nate jumped back and smiled at how my dignity and my jaw both dropped.  
  
The most beautiful man I had ever seen in my life was there on his television. I wanted to comb my fingers through Robert Woods' golden brown hair for hours on end. He appeared to have a jaw line that could cut through glass because it was clearly defined. His complexion was flawless, free of any imperfections, and flawlessly tanned. His pupilsHis eyes had a rich, chocolate color that completely engrossed me and caused me to lose awareness of my surroundings. They were so alluring, and I was certain that if I ever met this ideal human being, I would lose myself in them right away.  
  
Nate said, ""Wow,"" and laughed. It appears to be ""love at first sight.""  
  
I wiped the small amount of drool on the side of my mouth as I gathered myself. I then closed my jaw. I shook my head and cleared my throat.  
  
He's fine, I mumbled.  
  
Nate tells me to ""snap out of it"" as he turns my head away from the computer. ""You need to email him and set up the interview, but I'll tell you right now that I'm sure he'll decline since he categorically refuses to conduct interviews. You were given this position specifically so that you would fail, he explains sympathetically.  
  
I sigh and smooth my hair with my palm. ""Look, you don't realize that, alright? I'll write him a heartfelt note assuring him that everything will be handled in his favor.  
  
After I've removed his email from the ""Woods Enterprises"" website, I turn around and open my inbox. As I'm typing the email to him, my hands start to shake. I take great care to utilize the proper language and to write each word precisely. I reassure him that the interview will proceed according to his wishes and explain that Olivia Global only wants to speak with him briefly and ask him if he would be open to participating in a picture shoot for the feature. Before mailing, I add my signature and the name of the company I work for.  
  
I bite on my fingers tensely as my stomach begins to turn, expecting for a prompt response from him.  
  
The question ""Did you send it?"" Nate enquires as he hands me my stress ball to help me relax.  
  
I hesitantly nodded while biting my lip.  
  
""Move aside while I read it.""  
  
When he sits in my lap to read the email that was sent to Mr. Woods, I move out of the way and make a ""unf"" noise. Every syllable is scrutinized by his eyes, and when he is finished, he nods. ""you wrote this so well. Please refrain from feeling guilty or upset if he rejects it.  
  
""However, what sets you apart from other interviewers? He is unfamiliar with you even.  
  
""I don't know, look. Yet there is yet hope, alright? As though we were in a church, I encourage you to have some faith. Nate shakes his head and chuckles. Even if he rejects my request, I won't give up until he agrees to the interview. When my computer dings, I respond, ""I don't care if I have to go down to see him- see who it is for me.  
  
Nate nods before checking his latest email. Before noticing Nate grimace, I was going to continue my tirade at Robert . What is wrong, you ask?  
  
He smiles sympathetically at me and tilts my computer screen in your way. I read the most recent email while holding my spectacles up to my nose.  
  
Robert Woods; from. Isabella Jones, please.  
  
Greetings, Ms. Jones.  
  
I appreciate the offer, but I don't believe it will be necessary because I never conduct interviews. If you try to email me again, I'll file a restraining order against you, so stop doing it.  
  
Hello, Ms. Jones.  
  
Woods Robert.  
  
By the end of the letter, my eyes are wide as I gape in disbelief at the computer.  
  
Guess you'll have to visit his office and speak with him directly now, huh? Nate says, grinning.  
  
I turn around and shake my head as I stare at him. I scream, ""He said he'll frecking file a restraining order against me!"" And when I ask to speak with him, he doesn't even listen to me.  
  
Nate suddenly gives me a cheek slap. I exhale and grab my cheek as I stare at him in disbelief. He gasps as he wipes his cheek after I slap him back.  
  
""Ow,"" he whimpers. You little b\*tch, I was going to give one of those lectures you see in movies.""  
  
I whimper, scratching my cheek, ""Well sorry but it hurt you prick.""  
  
He grunts, ""Ugh whatever,"" and then rises to his feet. He glares at me and says, ""As I was going to say before I was rudely slapped, don't give up, at least not this easy.""  
  
""What should I do?"" he asked. I sobbed.  
  
""After I dress you up, you're going to waltz down to Woods Enterprises looking hot as f\*ck. Then, Nate grins, ""you're going to go up to his office and tell his secretary that you have an appointment with him.  
  
""She'll ask for my name, check it as soon as I say it, and see that my name isn't there. Then she'll tell Robert, who will recognize me right away and likely send security to get me."" I moan and squeeze my stress ball even tighter.  
  
You stupid, don't say your name because of it. He averts his gaze. ""Just follow my advice and put your faith in me, okay?""  
  
I contemplate if I should be doing this while biting my lip. I'm somewhat afraid of what he'll do and what he'll do to me if he finds out it's me and has security accompany me or whatever. That would be very embarrassing.  
  
Nate coos, ""Hey."" You'll be okay. I swear. Come on, you're not afraid to take a risk.  
  
I sigh and wipe my face with my palm. I don't fear anything or anyone, he's right. I always battle for what I want, and I will do so if it means getting Robert Woods to speak with Olivia Global. ""Okay, what's the strategy?""  
  
Okay, let's discuss what will happen when you visit Robert's office tomorrow.  
  
  
Chapter4  
I shout in panic, ""Nate, I'm frecking the f\*ck out.""  
  
We are getting set to go and persuade him to conduct the interview for Olivia Global as we wait outside Woods Enterprises. For me, Nate had undertaken a thorough makeover.  
  
I was still a nervous wreck despite the fact that I felt gorgeous and confident in this clothing and for once felt like I was on top of the world. In situations like that, I'm not afraid to yell and beat the crap out of someone if they step out of line with me, but I can't do that to him if he does because I need him to conduct the interview. As a result, I was afraid of how it was all going to play out and am afraid of how I'll react if he yells at me or something.  
  
""Hey,"" he says, grabbing my shoulders. Relax, alright? For me, take a breath in and out.  
  
I follow his instructions and close my eyes while inhaling deeply. He gives me a consoling grin and rubs my shoulders, which is truly helpful.  
  
""Now, enter the room with as much assurance as possible because, I promise, you look as assured and fierce as ever in this attire. You don't need to be timid or insecure.

1mfou65,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1mfou65/problems_with_my_dads_side_of_family/,Problems with my dads side of family,"SO SORRY THIS IS SO LONG
TLDR: Closer to my moms side than my dads side, they don‚Äôt make an effort to be close to me but i‚Äôm always blamed for it! I can‚Äôt take it anymore

Hello! I have something i need to get off my chest, it isn‚Äôt really a serious problem but maybe some responses would help me understand stuff better. 
First of all, english isn‚Äôt my first language so i‚Äôm sorry if i make mistakes :)

I came to reddit to spill this out because i talked to my father today about this and i can‚Äôt keep it to myself anymore, and don‚Äôt wanna bore my friends with it so i‚Äôm just trying to get it off my chest. 

So, i am a 19 year old female, i don‚Äôt really feel like saying where i‚Äôm from but i will say that it‚Äôs a slavic balkan country, maybe that will help you understand the situation better lol
The situation here is about my family, my moms and dads side specifically. Ever since i was a kid, i have been closer to my moms than dads side, they are overall just more open about their emotions. No complaints, they actually feel like family to me (which they are lol) and i consider them close, but on the other hand it‚Äôs completely different with my dads side. Here‚Äôs a little rundown 

My mom is 54 and my dad is 65, i have no brothers or sisters but i do have a half brother? From my dads past marriage, so he‚Äôs like the closest blood related sibling to me, he is 38 so the age gap is large and it is understandable we are not close, but we do not have any sort of relationship. He feels like a distant relative to me, we only talk sometimes and it‚Äôs always small talk like ‚ÄòHi how are you‚Äô ‚ÄòGood and you‚Äô ‚ÄòI‚Äôm good too‚Äô and that‚Äôs it. He is very successful, doing very well for himself and has better income than our father, and that‚Äôs very nice for him. But he is very cold and reserved, like most of them from my dads side, it feels like everyone is already close and that i don‚Äôt belong with them somehow. My half brother and i have NEVER been close, ever since i was a child i wanted to get close to him since you know he is my brother and i thought he was really cool always, but it never happened. My dad would always say stuff like ‚ÄúYou are younger, you should talk to him. How do you expect a 35 year old to just talk to a 16 year old‚Äù yeah‚Ä¶and how do you expect a 16 year old to talk to a 35 year old?? Like hello it‚Äôs not my fault
That‚Äôs basically our ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù in short. But that‚Äôs not the only problem, a lot of them from my dads side are like this, but my dad keeps on saying stuff like ‚ÄúThey love you‚Äù and ‚Äúthey want to have a relationship with you‚Äù when they clearly don‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs okay, i guess, i just feel sad whenever we go to a family function and everybody is talking to everybody, and it feels like i‚Äôm invited only because i‚Äôm my fathers daughter. I can‚Äôt imagine any single one of them, unironically, inviting ME somewhere, to a birthday party or wedding, whatever. And it just makes me sad you know, my dad always tells me to make an effort to talk to them, call them, whatever but i can‚Äôt do it alone. I don‚Äôt want to run after them in order to form a relationship without them doing anything back. 

I don‚Äôt want to make this story any longer, got it off my chest now so it‚Äôs fine. But i will give an example 

So my brother/cousin (a brother from my aunt, also very close idk how to say that in english, my fathers sister very close blood) got married a few months back. In april, there was a wedding held for ‚Äúthe closest‚Äù people in their lives i guess? And my dad mom and i were invited, other than us there were a couple of ‚Äúyounger‚Äù family members (married cousins or cousins with their partners) without their parents. And some of their friends. Whatever, it was a nice little gathering, my dad saw his sister‚Äôs son get married (idk how you call that) was very happy and everything was fine. But the wedding was held just for them to get married on paper you know not like a big party or anything, no church, nothing
Then, in may, they made the huge wedding, a looot of guests, church, all that stuff

We weren‚Äôt invited. :)
Now, you may think, oh okay but you were invited to the first wedding so it‚Äôs fine
Yeah well, everybody else basically as far as i know from the first wedding was also invited to this one, but we weren‚Äôt. I‚Äôm saying family from all over Europe came to this wedding, so it was a big deal 
Why weren‚Äôt we invited? We don‚Äôt know. My dad didn‚Äôt mind it at ALL and didn‚Äôt even ask his sister, the one he grew up with and was there when she was born, and for her son in which life my dads been HIS entire life. That was kinda crazy to me and that is why i‚Äôm like Okay if they do this when we‚Äôre clearly so ‚Äúclose‚Äù related, then other people won‚Äôt blink an eye when it comes to inviting us, or me, whatever. Since i don‚Äôt have any relationship with them whatsoever. 
My moms side, even when i don‚Äôt see or talk to some relatives for years and years, when we see each other everything, EVERYTHING is the same as it was before. So i know i‚Äôm not crazy, even with family members i‚Äôve never met or seen only as a child, nothing is awkward, nothing is uncomfortable, it feels normal and like family. My dads side doesn‚Äôt feel like that, but as you can probably tell i want it awfully to work out, i want to be in contact with them, i want to keep in touch and have a relationship. But i can‚Äôt just randomly start calling my relatives and being all like ‚ÄúHEYY AUNTT HOW ARE YOU LET‚ÄôS GO OUT FOR COFFEE‚Äù when she‚Äôs like, 60 years old. Of course, she‚Äôs an amazing person overall and i love her dearly, her age doesn‚Äôt matter and i do not mind it, it just feels weird you know. I awfully strive for their validation, for some time with them, to talk to them like i can talk to the people from my moms side normally without feeling uncomfortable. 

That‚Äôs it, i don‚Äôt know what to do, and i don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs normal. Thanks for reading if you did to this point <3

I‚Äôve many friends who keep thinking about starting something in Gorakhpur and are curious what gaps exist in Gorakhpur.

Like, we have great coaching centers but finding good co-working spaces? Nearly impossible. Want decent coffee that‚Äôs not overpriced hotel coffee? Limited options.

For me, it‚Äôs reliable freelance services. Need a good graphic designer or website developer locally? You‚Äôre basically shooting in the dark or going to Delhi/Mumbai agencies.

Also noticed most local businesses have zero online presence. Great restaurants that don‚Äôt show up when you Google ‚Äúbest food near Railway Station,‚Äù or something like ‚Äúbest digital marketing agency in Gorakhpur.‚Äù

Log Entry: UCSS Mender of Paths
Date: Cycle 4481.6.23
Incident Report Level: RED
Subject: Terran Unit #011 ‚Äî ‚ÄúJuno Reyes‚Äù
Filed by: Acting Captain Vur‚ÄôTash (Species: Gralthek)

‚∏ª

When the last of the Terran‚Äôs coffee reserves were consumed at 0730 shipboard time, I‚ÄîActing Captain Vur‚ÄôTash‚Äîdid not consider it a mission-critical concern.

The human, Juno Reyes, requested a caffeine resupply. I replied, with calm and reason, ‚ÄúWe are eight days from the next docking. You will endure.‚Äù

**I now understand this was a critical miscalculation.**

‚∏ª

0‚Äì8 Hours Post-Deprivation:

Juno appeared sluggish but functional. Minor tremors in the hand, a noticeable uptick in verbal aggression. Nothing the crew couldn‚Äôt handle.

He muttered something about ‚Äúsoul death‚Äù and ‚Äúcorporate war crimes,‚Äù which our linguist categorized as cultural idioms.

We carried on.

‚∏ª

9th Hour: The Spiral

Juno began disassembling engineering panels ‚Äî for ‚Äúemergency espresso extraction,‚Äù using coolant tubing and something called ‚Äúa French press made from hell.‚Äù

He was found screaming into the waste recycler, declaring it ‚Äúa lying son-of-a-bitch latte machine.‚Äù

Lt. Xarklin attempted to subdue him with empathy.

Xarklin is now in the medbay.

‚∏ª

10th Hour: The Reactor Incident

At precisely 1834 ship time, an alarm triggered in the fusion core chamber.

We found Juno hanging upside down, rerouting auxiliary power through a jury-rigged device built from warp capacitors, microwave emitters, and the medbay‚Äôs IV pumps.

When asked what he was doing, he shouted:

‚ÄúI‚ÄôM BREWING A GODDAMN MOCHA ON SUBSPACE FREQUENCIES. STAND BACK OR YOU WON‚ÄôT HAVE EYEBROWS!‚Äù

When Security Enforcer Drel attempted to intervene, Juno screamed, ‚ÄúBACK OFF, LIZARD SPARKLE! THIS IS FOR MY SANITY AND YOUR SAFETY!‚Äù

Drel backed off.

‚∏ª

11th Hour: The Breakthrough

Somehow ‚Äî and we still don‚Äôt understand the physics ‚Äî Juno‚Äôs contraption synthesized a liquid with caffeine-like properties. He drank it. All of it.

Then he smiled.

A Terran smile.

Even our AI core trembled.

‚∏ª

12th Hour: The Apology

Juno returned to the bridge, now eerily calm. He handed me a cup of his reactor-coffee and simply said:

‚ÄúNext time, don‚Äôt let it get this far.‚Äù

I took a sip. I don‚Äôt remember the next four hours. The AI blacked out. Our ship is now traveling at 3x maximum warp and we somehow bypassed a pirate blockade without weapons.

‚∏ª

Addendum:

The original Terran warning file has been recovered.

‚ÄúDO NOT deprive Human crew of caffeine beyond 8 hours. Risk: escalating stress behaviors, spontaneous invention, system override, and psychic trauma to crew. Treat as Class-B Neurochemical Emergency.‚Äù

Effective immediately, I am requesting:

	‚Ä¢	40 crates of Terran coffee

	‚Ä¢	3 industrial espresso units

	‚Ä¢	And a standing Caffeine Ration Treaty with EarthGov

For the love of the stars, never again.

Minerva Sowle said, ""Mr. Davison, Mrs. Davison, I've thought this through. I'm ready to become part of the Davison family.""

Minerva drew a steady breath and finally voiced the decision she had wrestled with for a long time.

Algernon Davison and Maxine Ford froze for a moment. They quickly set down their afternoon tea, reaching out to take her hands, their faces filled with joy.

""That's wonderful, Minerva! Algernon and I have always wanted a daughter as sweet and thoughtful as you. Our wish has finally come true.

""We'll get the paperwork started right away. Your name will be on the Davison family record in no time,"" Maxine said warmly.

""It won't take long. In just two weeks, everything will be official. We'll truly be a family then,"" Algernon added.

As the two of them excitedly began making arrangements, Minerva quickly stopped them.

""Wait, there's one more thing. My application for the study abroad program has been approved. I'll be leaving the country soon to continue my studies,"" she said gently.

Algernon's and Maxine's smiles faltered.

Maxine quickly said, ""So suddenly? We were hoping to host a celebration and make an official announcement‚Ä¶""

Minerva understood their feelings, so she reassured them with a gentle smile. ""Pursuing my studies abroad has always been my dream. And since we'll be family soon, it'll be easy to stay in touch. Flight tickets are simple to purchase, and we'll still have each other, no matter where I am in the world.""

The older couple exchanged a glance, then sighed while nodding.

""That makes sense,"" Algernon said. ""Alright. When are you leaving?""

Minerva smiled faintly. ""The day the paperwork is finalized‚Äîwhen you officially become my parents, and Frederick becomes my brother.""

Maxine immediately replied, ""Then, you should move in with us before that. We'll send someone to help pack your things.""

Seeing their eagerness and warmth, Minerva didn't refuse. She nodded lightly in response.

After arranging for someone to help her move, Algernon and Maxine seemed to remember something suddenly.

Maxine hesitated, then asked, ""About adding you to the family record‚Ä¶ should we be the ones to tell Frederick, or would you rather do it yourself?""

Minerva stiffened slightly.

Before she could answer, her phone buzzed with a new message. ""Eleganza Hotel. Bring ten boxes of condoms.""

It was from Frederick.

Minerva felt her heart tighten. After a long pause, she spoke, her voice slightly hoarse.

""I'll tell him myself.""

‚Ä¶

After leaving the Davison residence, Minerva hailed a cab.

She stared out the window as the city rushed past. Her thoughts were scattered in a tangled mess.

Life was truly unpredictable.

No one could have predicted that the man she loved would soon become her brother. She certainly hadn't expected this to happen.

The Davison and Sowle families had always been close. She and Frederick Davison had grown up side by side. They later became childhood sweethearts who seemed inseparable.

Everyone around them knew she was his, and no one ever dared to get too close.

At age seven, Minerva's delicate features drew the attention of every boy in class, all eager to sit beside her.

Frederick fought off every boy who tried, then claimed the seat beside her as if it naturally belonged to him. Even back then, his possessiveness was hard to miss.

At age 14, when Minerva's parents died in a tragic car crash, Frederick abandoned a regional tournament to rush back from another state. He stayed by her side all night, eyes rimmed red with unshed tears, aching for her in silence. He promised he would never leave her.

At age 16, Minerva knitted him a scarf. He wore it constantly‚Äîfrom winter straight through to summer‚Äîand even made her promise never to make one for anyone else.

At age 18, Frederick took her to a tattoo parlor and had his name inked on her chest‚Äîjust above her heart. He told her she would always belong to him.

The pair had crossed every boundary without there ever being a formal confession. Everyone, including Algernon and Maxine, thought they were destined to end up together.

But one day, Frederick suddenly brought home a plain, quiet girl no one had ever seen before‚Äîand introduced her to everyone as the only woman he would ever love.

Algernon and Maxine were stunned. They stood up for Minerva, openly voicing their disapproval.

But Frederick didn't care. He defied his parents, endured their punishments, and even gave up his place as heir to the Davison family‚Äîall just to be with Yolanda Wolfe.

No one ever understood what had changed in him.

When Algernon and Maxine realized they couldn't make Minerva their daughter-in-law, they chose to make her their daughter instead. They loved her too much to let her go.

At first, Minerva had hoped Frederick would come to his senses and return to his normal self.

But day after day, she watched him treat Yolanda like she was the center of his world‚Äîevery word gentle, every look indulgent. Eventually, Minerva's heart gave up. Whatever hope she had clung to finally died in her chest.

From that moment on, she would only ever be his sister.

There would be no future for Minerva and Frederick.

After getting out of the cab, Minerva walked into Eleganza Hotel and made her way to the room Frederick had texted her about.

The door was left slightly ajar. Inside, she could hear his voice‚Äîfamiliar and low.

Minerva knocked twice.

When no one answered, she pushed the door open.

Frederick stood there in a bathrobe, his arm casually wrapped around Yolanda, her clothes disheveled and slipping off her shoulders.

His head rested on her shoulder as he pressed slow kisses along her neck, completely entranced by her. His lips grazed her pale skin, coaxing soft gasps from her.

Embarrassed, Yolanda ducked into his arms the moment she noticed someone at the door.

Frederick chuckled and affectionately ruffled her hair before finally glancing at Minerva.

""Did you bring it?"" he asked.

Minerva didn't hand him the condoms right away. Instead, she looked up and said, ""I need to tell you something.""

Frederick averted his gaze. His voice was raspy as he asked, ""Does it have to be now?""

""Yes. I'll only say it today. If you want to hear it, I'll tell you. If not, you can forget it.""

Either way, he would learn the truth in two weeks.

Minerva's voice was calm, flat even.

Frederick didn't seem to take her words seriously. He kept twirling the ribbon on Yolanda's blouse and challenged, ""You really think now's a good time?""

Minerva's eyes followed his moving hands, landing on the bulge beneath his robe. A sharp ache hit her chest.

She understood exactly what he meant.

Years ago, back in school, they had once found themselves locked inside the gym by accident during winter. It had been freezing at the time. Frederick held her close to keep her warm.

At first, it was fine. But somewhere in the dark, Minerva had felt something hard pressing against her back. When she realized what it was, she flushed a bright shade of red and tried to pull away.

Frederick had just chuckled and brushed her nose lightly with his fingertip.

Then, he whispered in her ear, ""Minerva, do you know what it means when a guy reacts like this around someone?""

Later that night, she curled up under her blanket and searched for the answer. She found out that it only happened when a guy was around someone who made his heart race.

At that moment, her face heated up like she had a fever. For a long time after, she couldn't even look him in the eye.

But now, Yolanda was clearly the one who made his heart race.

Looking at them tangled together so intimately, Minerva didn't want to embarrass herself any further.

She stepped forward and laid out the ten boxes of condoms one by one on the coffee table. Then, she turned and walked away without another word.

""I understand now. Goodbye‚Ä¶ Frederick.""

The address made Frederick's brow furrow instantly. His voice rang out behind her, sharp with disbelief.

""What did you just call me?""

Chapter 2

Minerva stopped in her tracks.

Her voice was steady, completely devoid of emotion. ""It's nothing.""

Seeing that Minerva still hadn't left, Yolanda draped herself over Frederick's shoulder and pouted. ""Frederick, standing is exhausting. Will you carry me to bed?""

Frederick hadn't really caught what Minerva said to begin with. Now, with Yolanda clinging to him like this, he didn't spare Minerva another glance. He quickly scooped Yolanda up without hesitation and headed for the bedroom, tossing a final sentence over his shoulder.

""Make sure you shut the door on your way out.""

Minerva did as he asked. She closed the door behind her and walked away.

By the time she returned to the Davison residence, her things had already been moved in.

Algernon and Maxine were waiting. They brought her upstairs to see her new bedroom, asking if she needed anything else added.

She glanced around the room, then shook her head. ""No. Actually, I'd rather throw a few things out. The photo albums on the desk, the figurines and stuffed animals in the cabinets, and those dozen or so boxes of gifts‚Äîget rid of them.""

Every single item she named had been a gift from Frederick.

""From now on, Frederick is my brother. Keeping those around would be inappropriate. I don't want his girlfriend to misunderstand.""

Algernon and Maxine exchanged a look and sighed deeply. After a few more gentle reminders, they left her alone.

That night, Minerva slept soundly for the first time in months.

When she woke the next morning, she found dozens of missed calls on her phone. She stared at the screen, puzzled.

She had no idea why Frederick had called her so many times.

Before she could wonder further, the screen lit up again with an incoming call.

""Where did you go? Why is your place half-empty?""

There was something different in his voice‚Äîa flicker of panic she hadn't heard in years.

But remembering what she had seen the night before, she dismissed the thought with a bitter smile.

""I already talked to Mr. Davison and Mrs. Davison. I'll be living at your house for a while. What's going on?""

He seemed to relax on the other end of the line. He sounded casual again, indifferent even. ""Today's Rowena and Edric's wedding. Did you forget?""

""I didn't forget. I still have to get dressed and do my makeup. You go on ahead without me.""

Frederick didn't respond at first. The silence on the line stretched for several long seconds.

Minerva guessed he probably hadn't adjusted to the way things were between them now. Maybe, just like her, he was thinking about the past.

Back then, she had just started learning to use makeup. It always took her forever to get ready. She'd take three to four hours at least.

Frederick never once complained, though. He would wait patiently the whole time, helping her choose lipsticks and eyeshadow palettes.

She used to worry she was making him wait too long, so she would ask if he was bored.

He would smile as he gently wiped away her smudged eyeliner, his eyes full of quiet warmth. ""How could I ever get bored waiting for someone I want to wait for?""

But now, she wasn't that person anymore.

That was just how it was.

Frederick finally spoke again, his voice flat. ""Suit yourself.""

Then, he hung up.

Minerva didn't call him back. She simply got out of bed and went to wash up.

The wedding was being held at the largest hotel in Valemont.

As soon as Minerva stepped out of the car, she saw Frederick helping Yolanda out of another vehicle, his arm wrapped protectively around her waist.

Minerva spared a brief glance in his direction before turning away, greeting a few old classmates she hadn't seen in years.

After a few polite exchanges, a group of girls clustered together, lowering their voices to whisper behind cupped hands.

""There were only two real couples in our class, and one of them got married right after graduation. Do you think Frederick and Minerva are next?""

""Probably. I mean, Frederick never actually confessed, but come on‚Äîhis possessiveness over Minerva was obvious to everyone.""

""No kidding. I still remember when Minerva had awful cramps and tried to skip the fitness test, but the teacher wouldn't let her. Frederick snapped, arguing with the teacher in front of everyone. It escalated until it reached the principal's ears, and the teacher ended up getting a formal warning in front of the whole school.""

""There was another time Minerva was fangirling over some pop star with us. She just casually said he was cute‚Äîand Frederick's face turned dark on the spot. The next day, he showed up with freshly dyed purple hair and a leather jacket. I swear, he looked insanely hot.""

""Honestly, anyone who's ever seen them wants them to end up together. Even the teachers used to treat them like they were already dating.""

Hearing them bring up those memories, Minerva flashed a faint smile, masking the complicated emotions that flickered in her eyes.

Just then, someone spotted her and raised a glass. ""Minerva, isn't Frederick coming to the wedding today?""

Before she could reply, she felt a familiar gaze on her back. Minerva smiled lightly and pointed toward the entrance.

""He's here. Right over there.""

Everyone turned‚Äîjust in time to see Frederick beside a girl they didn't recognize, a soft smile playing on his lips. He carefully tied her hair up, then shrugged off his coat and draped it over her shoulders. One arm affectionately slid around her waist.

The girl whispered something, and Frederick dipped his head to kiss the corner of her lips. His expression was soft and indulgent.

The group fell silent. None of them had expected to see such an exchange. For a moment, they were frozen in stunned disbelief. Then, awkwardly, they turned away and quickly changed the subject.

Soon, the wedding festivities began.

The groom, Edric Warren, had been Frederick's best friend in high school. The bride, Rowena Heath, had been Minerva's closest friend.

Watching them walk hand in hand, from school uniforms to wedding attire, Minerva couldn't help but feel a wave of emotion. She smiled and clapped sincerely, sending them her blessings.

When it came time to toss the bouquet, the bridesmaids gathered in position. But just before the bouquet could be thrown, Rowena stepped forward and grabbed the microphone. She beamed at the crowd.

""Back in high school, the four of us made a promise. Whichever couple got married first would pass their happiness to the other. I know the two of them are here today. So, we're canceling the bouquet toss.""

After she finished speaking, Edric stepped up beside Rowena and loudly called out a pair of names.

""Frederick, Minerva, this bouquet is for you. You're the next ones to get married.""

Chapter 3

All at once, every pair of eyes turned toward the two people whose names had just been called.

Minerva remained perfectly still in place.

Conversely, Frederick rose to his feet, adjusted his suit jacket, and stepped confidently onto the stage.

Under the spotlight and with everyone watching, he confidently accepted the bouquet meant to symbolize a future of love and commitment.

But to everyone's surprise, he didn't hand it to Minerva. In fact, he walked past her entirely and headed straight for Yolanda.

Still smiling, he gently placed the bouquet in Yolanda's hands.

Yolanda looked down at the flowers in disbelief, her eyes brimming with tears. To her, this had to be a promise‚Äîa quiet vow for their future together.

Throwing her arms around him, she choked out, ""Frederick, thank you. Thank you for coming into my life‚Äîfor being my home, my safe place.""

Frederick gently wiped the tears from her cheeks. His voice was low and tender as he said, ""Silly girl. I'm the lucky one for meeting you.""

It should have been a touching moment, full of romance.

But the room remained eerily quiet.

In that stillness, Minerva was the first to smile and applaud.

A second later, applause erupted from every direction, peppered with murmured congratulations and heartfelt wishes of blessings and lasting joy.

Amid the rising chatter, Minerva picked up her purse and quietly slipped away to the restroom.

She moved too quickly to notice the pair of eyes watching her from across the room‚Äîcalm, unreadable.

‚Ä¶

At 3:00 pm, the wedding finally came to an end.

Rowena stopped Minerva at the door, guilt written all over her face. She apologized at once. ""I'm sorry, Minerva. I didn't know you and Frederick had broken up.""

Minerva knew she hadn't meant any harm, so she simply smiled and shook her head. ""You don't need to apologize. We were never together to begin with. There was no breakup.""

Rowena's expression fell further. She squeezed Minerva's hand, her voice rising with frustration. ""He never said anything? No confession, nothing? Then what the hell was Frederick doing all these years?

""Last year, when someone tried to drag you to that blind date event, he showed up with his buddies and tore the place apart. He never let any guy near you, ever. He's been guarding you like a hawk since we were kids‚Äîand now he just moves on?""

Minerva was touched by Rowena's indignation. A flicker of warmth settled in her chest.

""Rowie, it's not that he doesn't want me anymore. I'm the one who doesn't want him.""

Just as they were speaking, Frederick came over with his arm wrapped around Yolanda.

Watching the two of them act so intimately as if no one else existed, Rowena couldn't hold back any longer. She was ready to confront them on the spot.

Minerva quickly reached out to stop her. She shook her head and said, ""Let it go. From now on, there's only one kind of relationship between me and Frederick.""

""What kind of relationship?"" Rowena asked.

Minerva leaned in and lowered her voice. She told her everything‚Äîhow Algernon and Maxine had asked her to move into the Davison residence, how they had suggested adding her to the family record, and what she had agreed to.

Rowena's eyes widened in disbelief. It took her a second to process it all. Then, grinning, she whispered, ""Damn right you did.""

After exchanging a few more heartfelt words, Minerva headed downstairs.

From a distance, she spotted the couple waiting beside their car.

Just as she was about to take a different route to avoid them, Frederick called her name casually, one arm still around Yolanda.

""Minerva. Get in the car.""

Caught off guard, she froze for a second. Then, she politely declined. ""No thanks. I'll hail a cab.""

Frederick's smile dropped. His voice turned cold as he said, ""Why are you acting up again? This area's remote. You think you'll find a cab?""

Trying to ease the tension, Yolanda stepped forward, smiling sweetly as she took Minerva's hand. ""Ms. Sowle, we're heading to Halewood too. It's on the way, so we can give you a ride.""

Before Minerva could refuse again, Yolanda gently took her hand and guided her to the back seat.

The door shut, and the lock clicked behind her.

During the drive, Yolanda deliberately tugged her collar lower, revealing the faint red marks scattered along her neck and collarbone.

She coyly pouted. ""It's your fault for being so rough last night. I'm still sore all over.""

Frederick shot a glance at the rearview mirror, the corners of his mouth curled in a lazy, smug smile. ""You're the one who kept asking me to go harder. Landa, I always take care of you.""

""There's someone else in the car. You're so naughty!""

Blushing a deep shade of red, Yolanda giggled and pulled out a small box of fruit. She picked out a cherry and brought it to his lips. ""No more talking!""

Watching her playful act, Frederick couldn't help but laugh. As he bit into the cherry, he accidentally caught her finger between his teeth.

Yolanda's face flushed even deeper. She bit her lower lip, then slowly ran her damp fingers along the edge of his jaw, tracing down his throat to the center of his chest.

Something shifted in Frederick's gaze.

He slammed the brakes without warning, gripping the steering wheel tightly. After a long pause, he turned and looked at Minerva.

""I've got something to take care of. You need to get out of the car.""

Minerva rubbed the side of her forehead where it had bumped against the door. She said nothing in response. Quietly, she opened the door and stepped out.

She pulled out her phone and opened her rideshare app, selecting her destination. Just as she finished, she heard the unmistakable sound of a man gasping, breath hitched and low.

Her eyes flicked to the Maybach parked a few feet away, its frame beginning to rock in a slow, unmistakable rhythm.

Minerva's lashes fluttered, and her eyes stung with the burn of unshed tears.

She thought, ""So eager, huh?""

She remembered how, years ago, after he had first gotten his driver's license, he had promised to take her for a drive. But when he saw her in that simple white sundress, he couldn't resist and ended up holding her in his arms for two hours on the edge of town.

Somehow, it all started to make sense to Minerva. Frederick had always been ruled by his desire.

Minerva exhaled slowly. She stared at the app's interface that showed no cars in range, then turned and began walking.

Chapter 4

Minerva walked for nearly four hours before she finally made it to the city and flagged down a cab. By the time she got home, the sky had turned dark.

The soles of her feet were raw, bloodied, and riddled with blisters. Every step she took sent a sharp ache through her body.

She had just finished tending to her wounds when Algernon and Maxine came rushing down the stairs in a panic.

""Mr. Davison, Mrs. Davison, what's wrong?"" she asked, catching Maxine just in time before she stumbled.

Tears streamed down Maxine's face as she clutched Minerva's arms, her voice shaking.

""Frederick was in a car accident. He tried to protect that girl, Yolanda! I knew she was trouble. I told him she'd bring disaster, but he wouldn't listen. And now look at what he's done to himself. It sent him straight to the hospital!""

Seeing how distraught they were, Minerva worried they might collapse if things turned worse. So, she accompanied them to the hospital.

By the time they arrived, Frederick was out of surgery.

The doctor flipped through Frederick's chart, clicking his tongue. ""That was a serious crash. Your boyfriend fractured six ribs, but you didn't even get a scratch. If that's not proof of how far he's willing to go for you, I don't know what is.""

Yolanda let out a sob and flung herself into Frederick's arms, crying even louder.

Frederick let out a sharp breath, his jaw tightening as pain flickered across his face. But his eyes softened with concern as he looked at her. ""Alright, Landa. Don't cry. I did it willingly.""

His chest bandages were already tinged red, but he kept comforting Yolanda like nothing mattered more. Watching this, Algernon and Maxine lost their patience completely.

They stormed forward and pulled Yolanda off him, their voices sharp and furious. ""Move! You're pressing on his ribs.""

Yolanda clutched at the hem of her blouse, her tears falling again.

""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I just‚Ä¶ I'm just so worried about him.""

1mfolhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mfolhf/second_chance_her_regret/,Second Chance |  Her Regret,"# Chapter 1 Her Regret

In the empty room, Jessica Atkinson held a paintbrush in her hand, listening to her mother's weary voice over the phone.

Stella Grant said, ""Jessi, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's seriously ill. You're the only child your dad and I have. Are you really still not coming home to take over the company?""

In the dim light, Jessica added the final stroke to a painting of a family of three.

Just as Stella thought she'd failed to convince her daughter again, Jessica suddenly spoke, ""Okay.""

Stella froze, clearly caught off guard. ""Y-you're saying yes?""

""Yes."" Jessica's voice was calm. ""I'll do it. But I need some time to wrap things up here. I'll be back in 15 days.""

After a few more words, she ended the call.

Jessica stepped out of the room and looked down at the three people in the living room.

Her eyes landed on the man sitting on the couch‚ÄîBrian Atkinson. His features were striking, sharp without being harsh.

He had a quiet, restrained kind of presence. His shirt and slacks were perfectly tailored, the collar buttoned all the way to the top. He looked every bit the picture of elegance and control.

This was Jessica's husband, the man she had insisted on marrying even though it meant turning down her family's arrangement and cutting ties with them.

In Hartdale, Brian held tremendous power and was always serious and distant. People around him saw him as cold and untouchable, yet now he was speaking to another woman in a gentle tone.

Beside them, a boy around five years old with delicate features, Jacob Atkinson, threw himself into the woman's arms. Blinking his wide eyes, he said sweetly, ""Maddie, I want fish casserole. Will you make it for me?""

Madeline Houghton tapped his nose with a fond smile. ""Of course.""

Jacob's eyes lit up, clearly thrilled. He remarked, ""Maddie, you're the best. Not like my mom‚Äîshe never lets me eat too much."" As he spoke, he even pouted a little.

Madeline smiled and gently coaxed him, ""Then you've got to eat a little extra today, Jake.""

Jacob nodded with a warm chuckle. ""Maddie, I wish you were my real mom.""

Madeline's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Jessica felt a dull ache in her chest. She always thought kids tended to overeat when they liked something. She only watched Jacob's diet because she didn't want him to get sick. That was all.

Jessica didn't feel like watching any longer. That was her husband and her son, but somehow, the three of them looked more like a real family. She was the one who seemed out of place.

She turned around and went back into the room.

Not long after, footsteps came from outside. Madeline walked in. Her makeup was flawless, her smile gentle. ""Jessi, come downstairs with me. Let's celebrate Jake's birthday together.""

Madeline used to be Jessica's intern. She came from a poor background and was barely competent.

Jessica had once listened to Madeline cry about her past, saying that if she still couldn't find a job, she would have no choice but to go back to her hometown and get married.

Jessica had felt sorry for her and brought her into the company. She never imagined she'd end up bringing in the very woman who would destroy her family.

Madeline had studied her, mimicked her, and tried to take her place‚Äîto become the new Mrs. Atkinson. By the time Jessica realized it, Madeline had already made her way into the household, getting along perfectly with her husband and son.

Jessica had long seen through the mask Madeline wore and had hated herself for bringing trouble into her own home. Jessica said coldly, ""I'm not feeling well. I'm not going.""

Madeline spoke with feigned innocence, ""Jessi, you're Jake's mom. It would mean a lot to him if you said happy birthday to him.""

Jessica frowned, about to turn her down again. But then something crossed her mind, and she let out a sigh.

She figured this was between her and Madeline. Jacob was still just a child who shouldn't be affected by it. As his mother, Jessica felt it was only right to wish him a happy birthday.

With that thought, she set down her paintbrush and walked downstairs, brushing past Madeline's shoulder, completely ignoring her.

For a split second, Madeline's smile froze. A flicker of malice passed through her eyes, but she quickly followed after.

When Jessica saw Brian and Jacob, she paused.

Ten years ago, she'd joined the Atkinson Group to challenge herself and met Brian there. They'd fought, teased, and fallen into marriage. She had rejected her family's carefully laid plans and insisted on marrying Brian, even cutting ties with them to do it.

For the past ten years, she'd never once regretted her decision. Her husband was rich, handsome, and he treated her well. Their son was smart and adorable. She had once truly believed she had a happy life.

But then, Jessica looked at Madeline, who was smiling attentively as she served food to Brian and Jacob. Madeline's presence had changed everything that once felt so perfect.

Jessica silently picked up her fork to eat, but then a wave of nausea hit her. She quickly put the fork down and rushed to the bathroom, gagging over the sink.

Brian stood up, looking concerned, about to follow her, but Madeline stopped him in a flurry of panic.

She clutched his sleeve, her eyes wide with worry. ""Mr. Atkinson, what's going on with Jessi?""

Brian spoke gently, trying to reassure her, ""She's been like this lately. It's nothing. Don't worry.""

After saying that, he turned to look at Jessica and sneered coldly, ""What's the excuse this time? A cold? Or is the food at home not good enough?""

Jessica didn't respond. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue and thought, 'If I said I was pregnant, would they even believe me?

'Forget it. I'm leaving soon anyway. Why bother telling them? No need to ruin the sweet little bond between my husband and his mistress.'

Even as a secretary, Madeline still dared to chide her boss, speaking in a syrupy tone, ""Mr. Atkinson, don't say that about Jessi. Maybe she really isn't feeling well. She's lost a lot of weight lately.""

Then she stood up, made a cup of hot chamomile tea, and handed it to Jessica. ""Jessi, are you okay? Here, have some chamomile tea.""

Still nauseous and not wanting to see Madeline's face, Jessica grew irritated and pushed her away.

She hadn't even used much force, but Madeline let herself fall with the motion, and the hot chamomile tea spilled onto her own hand.

""Ow!"" Madeline cried out.

""Maddie,"" Brian and Jacob called out at the same time. They instantly rushed to her side, their eyes full of concern as they looked at her hand which was scalded red.

Jacob's eyes welled with tears, feeling sorry for her. ""Maddie, does it hurt a lot?""

Madeline forced a smile and tried to look strong. ""It's okay, Jake. I was just being careless. It doesn't hurt.""

Brian glared at Jessica, his eyes blazing. His voice was like ice. ""What are you trying to pull now?""

Jessica was overwhelmed with sadness and disappointment. She caught the smug look in Madeline's eyes, then saw her own son standing in front of Madeline like a little protector. Jessica shut her eyes in despair and said, ""I didn't do anything.""

But Brian didn't believe her. When the family doctor arrived, Brian helped Madeline sit down, letting her lean against his chest. There was disappointment in his deep-set eyes as well.

He said accusingly, ""Jessi, you've changed. You were never the kind of person to do something like this out of jealousy.""

Jessica thought, 'I've changed? Yeah, I have.'

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had stretch marks from childbirth. Her skin wouldn't have gone dull from staying up all night.

And she definitely wouldn't have quit her job and become a housewife just because of Brian's words‚Äîonly to be replaced by another woman.

Jessica suddenly felt exhausted. She held back the explanation she almost gave and turned to head upstairs.

Right before entering her room, she looked back down at the chaotic scene below and gave one last glance at the husband and son she had once loved with everything she had.

Brian and Jacob were still the same, hovering around Madeline, the three of them tangled up like they couldn't bear to be apart.

Jessica gave a bitter smile and shook her head. Then she gently touched her belly and set a countdown on her phone. Without a trace of hesitation, she turned and went back into the room.

From this moment on, she wouldn't disturb them again.

# Chapter 2 She Was Done Playing Along

The noise outside gradually faded. Jessica didn't bother to check what was going on out there. With her earplugs and sleep mask on, she slept straight through to morning.

Since she'd already decided to return and claim her inheritance, she had to resign from Atkinson Group.

After giving birth to Jacob, she had rarely shown up at the company. But back when Brian had taken over the family business, she had been right there beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up.

Atkinson Group's rise to the number-one spot in the country had a lot to do with her. So even though she didn't come in regularly, she still received a generous annual bonus and profit share.

Early in the morning, Jessica looked at herself in the mirror. Her thick, wavy hair framed a flawless face. She was stunning, but her eyes carried no light.

She had always been beautiful. Even after becoming a stay-at-home mom, even after all the sleepless nights and labor, her looks had barely changed.

But the morning sickness, the emotional strain, and the cold treatment from her family had taken their toll. Her eyes were dull, lifeless‚Äîlike fish washed up on the shore.

On the top floor of Atkinson Group, Jessica was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Just then, a few employees behind her started chatting, their voices drifting into earshot.

One said, ""Did you see Madeline's Instagram post?""

Another asked, ""No, what did she post this time?""

Someone else added, ""She posted a bunch of stuff. Looks like she was throwing someone a birthday party. You should check it out.""

They were laughing as they teased each other, but when they looked up and saw Jessica, their smiles froze.

One of them gasped, ""Ms. Grant?""

Another asked, ""Ms. Grant, what brings you here to the office?""

Jessica gave a casual nod. As soon as the employees finished greeting her, they dashed away in a hurry. More whispers followed as they left.

Someone sneered, ""What a buzzkill. What's the executive secretary Jessica doing back here at the company?""

Another said sarcastically, ""She's already the CEO's wife. What's the point of showing off in front of us?""

Someone else snorted, ""I don't think Mr. Atkinson's that close to her anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they're getting a divorce.""

Jessica didn't react. She had never been popular in the company and had long gotten used to this kind of talk.

If she hadn't gone through so much workplace bullying in the past‚Äîif Brian hadn't stepped in and helped her so many times‚Äîshe wouldn't have fallen for him to begin with.

Bored from waiting, Jessica opened Instagram on her phone. The first thing that popped up was a nine-photo post from Madeline.

The first image was taken at Jacob's birthday party last night. The decorations were extravagant, and the giant three-tier cake in the center was impossible to miss.

What caught Jessica's eye was a photo taken in a hospital. Three hands, all different sizes, stacked on top of each other‚Äîit looked so warm and loving.

Jessica thought, 'It was just a burn. Why'd they go to the hospital again?'

She found it ridiculous and scrolled through the comments. Most of them were full of envy and well-wishes.

One comment read: \[Wow, a birthday party for the little one? Looks so happy.\]

Another joked: \[Showing off again‚Äîso who's your husband anyway? Not gonna show your bestie?\]

Someone else wrote: \[No matter what happens, as long as the family's together, that's what really matters.\]

Jessica was speechless. She knew Madeline had posted those on purpose, just to get under her skin and push her into snapping at Brian.

If it had been before, Jessica really wouldn't have been able to stand this pretentious act, watching her own husband and son leave her at home to care for a woman who had done nothing but poorly imitate her from the start.

But now that she was about to leave, she naturally didn't care anymore.

Jessica gave a dry smile and tapped the screen lightly to give the post a like.

After getting her resignation papers, Jessica went straight to the CEO's office and handed them to Brian's current personal assistant.

The people in the Secretary's Office, just like the ones who had been whispering earlier, looked down on her for showing up as if she were trying to brag. But the moment they saw the resignation papers, they gasped in shock.

Someone asked, ""I-I didn't read that wrong, did I?""

""Ms. Grant is quitting?"" another exclaimed.

The assistant froze, visibly panicked. ""M-Ma'am, Mr. Atkinson is in a very important meeting right now. Maybe we should wait and let him have a look at these until he's done.""

""No need. I'm just a figurehead executive secretary. You have the authority to process this. No need to bother him,"" Jessica said with a light smile.

People around them sighed under their breath.

""Is the rumor true? Jessica and Mr. Atkinson are getting a divorce? And the other woman is Madeline?""

""Why Madeline? Doesn't she have a family?""

""Are you dumb? Did you even see that Instagram post? That hand is clearly Mr. Atkinson's. Who else in Hartdale could wear a Rolex that expensive?""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice Madeline took over all of Jessica's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""Now that Jessica's quitting, maybe she's handing the position over.""

Jessica knew exactly how nosy these people were. In the past, hearing things like this would've crushed her. She would've curled up in bed at night, crying quietly under the covers.

But now, she suddenly realized that once she let it go, none of it really mattered.

She smiled at everyone like she couldn't hear a word and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work these past ten years. I hope Atkinson Group continues to thrive for many more to come.""

Everyone fell silent in embarrassment. Only then did Jessica return to her desk and begin packing up everything she'd accumulated over the years.

She had worked here for ten years, and her workspace was filled to the brim with books she'd bought when she first started out and notes she'd taken while learning to understand Brian as his secretary.

On one page, it clearly said: ""1. He needs a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning. 2. He hates being late. 3. He doesn't allow any woman to wear perfume around him.""

There were many notes like that. Every single one of them had been built with Jessica's effort.

She had poured so much into doing her job as a secretary well, but people always assumed the role was just a man's plaything‚Äîthat all it took was a body, not a brain.

Only Brian had seen her working late into the night‚Äîreviewing contracts, building presentations, digging into the background on every competitor of Atkinson Group, and reciting business reports like they were second nature.

It was because she worked hard enough that someone as untouchable as Brian had come down from his pedestal to get close to her.

Jessica had once believed Brian was the one person who truly understood her. She was wrong. After ten years, all those memories and feelings had turned to dust.

She focused on packing her things. Just then, the meeting ended, and Madeline walked out first.

She had been beaming, but the moment she saw Jessica, her smile froze. Madeline thought, 'Why is Jessica here? Did she see my Instagram post? Is she here to lose it on me?

Just thinking about it made her excited. She went back to her desk, restless, waiting for the storm to hit. On the outside, though, she kept her head down, her eyes turning red, like she'd just been horribly wronged.

Brian was the last to walk out. As he passed the Secretary's Office, he saw Jessica there at the office.

Her desk was the closest to his office, a setup that once symbolized her status and their past affection.

But now, just the sight of her annoyed him especially when she looked like she was in a good mood, flipping through a book with a faint smile on her face.

Right next to her, Madeline sat with her head down, looking dejected, quietly dabbing at her tears with a tissue.

Brian frowned, tapped the corner of Jessica's desk, and ordered, ""Come in.""

Jessica looked up, calm and composed. ""Okay.""

Once she stepped inside, Brian got straight to the point. ""The company doesn't need you right now. If there's no special reason, don't come to Atkinson Group again.""

# Chapter 3 Mrs. Atkinson

Jessica froze. No matter how many times she'd been disappointed by Brian, every time she heard his cold tone, it still felt like a knife stabbing straight into her chest.

Her eyes lowered, and the smile on her face disappeared. ""Okay.""

Brian had expected Jessica to lash out, but he hadn't thought she'd give in so easily. Only then did he actually look at her.

He noticed Madeline was right‚ÄîJessica really had lost a lot of weight lately.

He thought, 'Maybe Jessica really was throwing up last night because she wasn't feeling well. Maybe she wasn't being jealous in front of Madeline after all.'

His lips pressed together, and his tone softened slightly. ""Madeline's been doing your job well. Your focus now should be taking care of Jake. I've explained this to you so many times‚Äîthere's nothing between me and her.

""Jessi, stop making trouble. Don't make me regret choosing you to be my wife.""

Jessica thought, 'Regret? I regret it too. I really regret giving up my family's business just to become this so-called Mrs. Atkinson. The Grant family has real status. Grant Group is powerful. I could've gone back and been the heiress everyone doted on instead.'

Jessica closed her eyes and calmly pulled out her resignation letter. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Atkinson, then please go ahead and approve this. I'll officially resign starting tomorrow.""

With that, she turned to leave. But just as she reached the door, Brian grabbed her arm.

""Jessica?"" Brian sounded surprised, as if he hadn't fully processed what was happening. Holding the resignation in one hand, he instinctively reached out and caught her.

He stared at her signature on the resignation letter. His face darkened as he held back a surge of anger. ""You're doing this to spite me? I thought you came today to make peace, but now you're taking it even further?""

""No, Mr. Atkinson. You said Atkinson Group didn't need me, and it just so happens‚ÄîI feel the same."" Jessica kept her gaze lowered, her thick lashes trembling slightly. ""It's been ten years. Atkinson Group isn't what it used to be.

""Since everyone clearly loves Madeline, I figured I might as well step down now instead of holding a position and collecting a paycheck for doing nothing.""

Brian let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp, like he could see straight through her excuse. ""Don't use the past ten years to guilt me. I know Atkinson Group wouldn't be what it is today without you. You were a great employee.

""But Jessica, ever since you had the baby, you haven't been involved in any business matters. I've been nothing but considerate. All you have to do is take care of our son, and you'll always be the lady of Atkinson Group.

""You can't even handle something this simple, and now you say you're stepping aside? All you're doing is putting Madeline in a difficult position. Jessica, I know you too well. You're calculating, but don't be cruel. Since last night, have you even apologized to Maddie?""

Jessica thought, 'Apologize? I'm supposed to apologize to the woman who wrecked my home? Shouldn't she be the one thanking me?'

Suddenly, Jessica let out a laugh and looked at Brian with a hint of curiosity. ""Yes, I'm cruel. Mr. Atkinson, have you never considered giving up?""

The kind of giving up she meant was divorce.

Over the past few years, whenever Brian and Jessica fought, she brought up divorce again and again, and every time it ended in an ugly stalemate.

Brian had never agreed. In his eyes, even if he cheated, Jessica was still his wife.

That was always how it was with Brian‚Äîdomineering and controlling, a man who held power over all of Hartdale.

As for Jessica, at the beginning, she hadn't really meant to leave. She had been acting out, like Brian said, hoping he'd actually care more about her.

But now, she was tired. She was fine with getting a divorce and going their separate ways. She even thought about the kids. They could each take one, and that would be that.

Brian's face darkened, his grip on her arm tightening like he could snap her in half. ""This is your last chance, Jessica. If you mess up again, I won't hesitate to find Jake a new mom.

""Do you know how many times he's complained to me he has no joy or freedom living with you? Why are you such a failure as both a wife and a mother?""

The word ""failure"" made her close her eyes and let out a long breath.

Jessica thought, 'So that's how it is. Waiting up all night for Brian to come home and making him hangover cures was a failure. Hand-washing his designer suits in the dead of winter until my hands were raw was a failure.

'Tutoring Jake through elementary math, raising a child who fit the Atkinson family's image of an heir was a failure. This home really has no place for me anymore.'

""I'm sorry, Mr. Atkinson,"" Jessica said sincerely. She believed someone who failed should take a final bow and leave the stage.

Her other hand slipped into her coat pocket and tapped her phone screen. The countdown began‚Äîthere were fourteen days left.

Once everything was in order, she would disappear completely. Brian would never have to be annoyed by her again.

Jessica's attitude caught Brian off guard. He still wanted to say something, but she didn't give him the chance and turned to leave.

She walked away without hesitation. Brian reached out again, but caught nothing.

Suddenly, a sharp pain clenched in his chest, a wave of panic rising fast and hard.

He frowned, watching her disappear down the hall, a strange sense growing stronger‚Äîthat something important was slipping further and further away from him.

Once outside, Jessica called her best friend, Gabriela Clark. They were besties, though they hadn't spoken in over six years.

Gabriela was a fashion designer, constantly flying around the country, tailoring clothes for different models. A lot of them were male, and with adults working in close quarters, it wasn't unusual for things to happen.

Put plainly, Gabriela went through boyfriends like outfits. Brian had always hated that about her. After Jessica had their child, he'd told her to stay away from Gabriela, said she'd be a bad influence on Jacob.

So Jessica had listened and cut ties with the friend she grew up with for six whole years.

After not hearing from Jessica for years, Gabriela was furious. She picked up and snapped, ""So you finally remembered I exist? Jessica, I thought you were way too far gone in your lovesick haze. And now you finally call‚Äîwhat, regretting it already?""

Jessica let out a helpless laugh, tears falling before she even noticed.

She hadn't cried when Brian humiliated her, hadn't cried when Madeline made a fool of her, not even when the child she carried for nine months called someone else Mom. But with Gabriela, Jessica sobbed in regret.

""Yes, I regret it,"" Jessica said. ""Gabi, if I come back now, is it too late?""

On the other end of the line, Gabriela went quiet for a long time after hearing Jessica's sincere words. When she finally spoke again, her voice was choked with tears.

She said, ""I'm just glad you've come to your senses. You idiot, do you have any idea how exhausting it's been running the studio for you all these years? The entire art world's been waiting for your return.

""Jessica, being a CEO's secretary only buried your talent. You were born to be an artist‚Äîyou're the last true gem of the Impressionist world. Jessi, I've been waiting for you this whole time.""

""I'm sorry, Gabi. I'm so sorry."" Jessica crouched down in the middle of the street, crying.

Jessica was always meant to be proud. She had been brilliant and talented from the start. Even Brian didn't know that she had studied fine art at a university in Fiorenelle, a city in Aurevia.

Her very first graduation piece had made it into the Viremont Grand Biennale, shocking the entire art world.

After graduation, the paintings she signed off on had sold at auction for more than a million dollars.

And yet, for the sake of so-called experience, she came back to the country and started over in a job that had nothing to do with her field. She studied admin, finance, and business management from scratch and still excelled at it.

She gave up painting for ten years. But today, she had finally decided‚Äîshe was going back.

# Chapter 4 Her Ungrateful Son

After agreeing on a time with Gabriela to take over the studio, Jessica returned to Atkinson Villa.

She had given herself a 15-day countdown because ten years had left too many things unresolved. She couldn't just walk away. There were still matters to handle.

The most important of all was everything inside Atkinson Villa.

The massive villa, over 5,000 square feet, had no housekeepers simply because Brian thought they were too noisy. The daily cleaning had always fallen to Jessica.

Now that she was leaving, she intended to step down like the perfect secretary she'd always been. It was a matter of pride‚Äîas the heiress of the Grant family.

Madeline clearly wasn't the type to do housework, so Jessica had to find a qualified housekeeper for her husband and child.

During the day, Jessica interviewed several candidates, having each of them cook according to Brian's preferences. In the evening, as she was eating at home, an urgent voice came from the front door. ""Chester, call the family doctor. Now."" It was Brian.

Jessica, being pregnant, was especially sensitive to the smell of blood, and the air immediately made her nauseous.

She frowned, an instinctive worry rising. 'What happened? Is he hurt?' she pondered.

She instinctively started toward the door, only to see Brian hurrying in, carrying a woman in his arms. It was winter in Hartdale, snow falling steadily, soaking his hair and shoulders, but he didn't seem to notice.

He laid the woman down on the couch and barked, furious, ""Where is the family doctor? Hurry up.""

Jessica didn't even need to see the woman's face to know who she was. It was Madeline.

Wrapped in her thick robe, Jessica stood to the side and calmly asked, ""What happened to her?""

They had just argued in the morning. Brian glanced at Jessica but didn't seem interested in talking to her. His voice was filled with annoyance. ""She ran into some loan sharks and took a stab to the shoulder.""

""Loan sharks? Whose debt?"" Jessica asked, curious. She thought, 'What, has the CEO of Atkinson Group gone bankrupt?'

Before Brian could respond, Madeline, pale and weak, spoke up in a pitiful voice, ""I'm sorry, Jessi. It's my fault. My dad owes gambling debts, and somehow those people found out I was Mr. Atkinson's secretary.

""They waited on a dark road tonight and tried to kidnap me. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Atkinson was working late and happened to be there. If he hadn't shown up and saved me, I might've been killed.""

""Don't say things like that,"" Brian said sharply. ""As long as I'm around, no one will lay a finger on you. But your place isn't safe for now. I've already called the police. Until they catch those men, you'll stay at Atkinson Villa.""

""No."" Jessica didn't hesitate at all.

Hearing that, Brian looked up at her.

Jessica seemed in good spirits. Maybe it was because she had quit her job and reconnected with her best friend. Her cheeks were rosy, her skin glowing. She wore a soft silk robe, standing there lazily, full of charm.

Brian had been irritable since morning, but hearing Jessica's flat rejection actually calmed him down.

He turned his head, sneering with what looked like mockery. He thought, 'Just like I thought. Another game of push and pull. She acts like she's indifferent, but deep down she's still jealous of Madeline.'

His tone turned low and warning. ""Jessica, this is Atkinson Villa."" He was the one who owned this place. Whoever got to stay here was up to him.

""She still can't stay,"" Jessica said firmly. ""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

Atkinson Villa was big, spanning three full floors, but there were only three actual bedrooms.

One room was for Jacob, one for Jessica, and one for Brian. That was all there was.

There used to be extra guest rooms in Atkinson Villa, but back when Jessica and Brian were newlyweds and still happy, Brian had had them all remodeled.

There was a luxurious nursery, a walk-in closet, a display room for luxury goods, and spaces Jessica used to pass the time‚Äîlike a flower room, an art studio, and a yoga room. But there were no extra bedrooms.

In fact, the third bedroom was planned by Brian for their second child in the future. But back then, they never imagined that one day they'd be sleeping apart because of emotional distance.

Brian hadn't expected Jessica to reject Madeline's stay for this reason. His face instantly darkened.

His voice was tight, like he was clenching his teeth. ""Jessica, you sleep in the master bedroom.""

The implication was clear‚Äîthey could share a bed. After all, no matter how strained things had gotten, just three months ago, they had still slept together. That was how Jessica ended up pregnant.

But Jessica didn't care. That night had only happened because Brian was drunk three months ago. Back then, her feelings had been a tangled mess of love and resentment. Now, neither was left. There was no reason for them to be intimate anymore.

Jessica stood her ground, stubborn and unmoving, and the sight of it made Brian's anger boil over.

At that moment, Jacob came downstairs, still groggy from sleep. ""Dad, Mom, what's going on? I heard you two arguing again.""

He spoke with a pouty, wronged tone, then glanced over and saw Madeline on the couch, still bleeding as her wound was being treated. He snapped to attention. ""Maddie.""

Jacob ran over quickly. ""Maddie, what happened? Why are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Madeline smiled, patting his head, ""It's nothing, Jake. Be good and go back to bed.""

""I'm not going. You're hurt. I'm not sleeping until you're better."" Jacob was still a clingy child, and he clung to Madeline without letting go.

Seeing how much he liked Madeline, Jessica suddenly curved her lips into a smile. ""Jake, don't worry. Maddie might be staying with us for the next few days.

""But since we don't have enough bedrooms, would it be okay if Maddie sleeps in your room with you?""

""Really?"" Jacob's eyes widened, full of excitement and joy. ""Yeah, that'd be‚Äî""

Halfway through, he quickly clamped his hand over his mouth. ""No, I didn't mean it like that, Mom.""

Jacob thought, 'I totally forgot. Mom hates it when I act like I love Maddie. The last time I stayed out playing with Maddie too long and forgot to come home, Mom got super mad.

'After that, Dad told me I shouldn't let Mom see how much I love Maddie.'

""It's okay. You can mean it,"" Jessica said quietly, her voice soft as her cold hands beneath the robe rested gently over her belly.

Today, she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ungrateful child.

Jessica still remembered the day Jacob was born. She'd gone through a long labor for nearly two days. The doctors had said she might not survive and told Brian he had to choose whether to save the mother or the baby.

Brian's eyes had been bloodshot, screaming outside the OR that he only wanted Jessica.

But Jessica had refused. In tears, she'd begged the doctors to save the baby. She'd said she could give up everything, anything‚Äîjust not the child she shared with Brian.

In the end, she'd pulled through on sheer will, giving birth to Jacob naturally without a single dose of anesthesia.

Jessica gave up her career to raise Jacob herself, day in and day out. And now, what she got in return was a child who favored another woman and wanted a different mom.

Jessica was really tired. She hadn't even wanted to keep the baby she was carrying. When she got the results from last week's checkup, her first instinct had been to give it up.

Her life felt too hopeless. She hadn't planned on having another child with Brian.

But when she thought about leaving, Jessica started to feel a glimmer of hope. She thought that maybe this time, without the Atkinson family holding her back, she and her child could grow freely and things might be better.

With that thought, Jessica stopped looking back and walked away.

Jacob didn't understand why his mom was acting this way. He stood frozen, watching her leave, silent for a long time, and then suddenly burst into tears.

He was a sensitive kid. Even if he didn't understand anything, something deep in his blood told him he was being left behind.

His sudden crying startled Madeline. She quickly hugged him and tried to comfort him, ""Jake, don't cry. I'm right here. Don't be scared.""

She looked at Brian, nervous, her eyes brimming with tears like she was silently accusing Jessica of making Jacob cry again.

Brian's face was grim. He looked up toward the second floor, his eyes brooding. But in the end, he didn't say a word.

# Chapter 5 She'd Had Enough

Jessica slept through the night without dreams. The next morning, when she came downstairs planning to make herself breakfast, she smelled food the moment she reached the stairs.

It was Madeline. She had already made breakfast for the whole family and was now grinding coffee for Brian by hand.

When she saw Jessica, she smiled and greeted her, ""Jessi, you're up. Come on, I made sandwiches. I'm not sure if you'll like them.""

""Maddie's cooking is great. Who wouldn't like it?"" Jacob chimed in with a bright smile, then sneaked a glance at Jessica. There was a flicker of fear in his expression. He was afraid of his mother, and he resented her too.

He felt like Jessica had suddenly become a different person. He didn't understand why she had looked at him with such a cold expression before.

Every time Jacob praised Maddie in the past, it would set Jessica off, making her try harder to be good to him‚Äîjust so he could use that as a chance to slack off from all his tutoring sessions.

Jessica could more or less guess what her son was thinking. She let out a faint, mocking smile and thought, 'Does he really think I, his mother, can't see through a kid's little tricks?'

Jessica had indeed resented Madeline out of jealousy in the past‚Äîbut only because she couldn't accept that her husband had such a close third party in his life.

As for how Madeline treated Jacob, Jessica had always turned a blind eye.

Jacob was the heir of the Atkinson family. After Jessica gave birth, Brian's mother, Paisley Atkinson, had warned her countless times not to slack off when it came to Jacob's education.

Jessica had always believed in a happy, low-pressure way of raising her child. She knew Jacob was a lively, sweet boy who loved comic books, playing games, and being in nature.

But as Brian's wife, and as the ever-watched Mrs. Atkinson in high society, she had to play the part of a strict and proper mother.

That was why Jacob always ran to his dad, complaining that his mom was too harsh.

What he didn't know was that, while Jessica was strict, she had read educational books from all over the world, doing her best to create a teaching method that balanced structure and rest.

Jessica might have seemed like a stern mother, but back when Madeline was still her intern, it was Jessica who had personally handed her a hand-drawn storybook she had made herself and asked her to use those toys to bond with Jacob.

Jacob's favorite dish‚Äîfish casserole‚Äîwas something Jessica had taught Madeline how to make, step by step.

Jessica never imagined that all the care and effort she once gave would turn into a weapon against her in the end. Her expression turned cold, touched with a kind of hopeless absurdity. ""What are you wearing?""

Madeline hadn't expected Jessica's first words to be that. She looked nervous. ""I-it's a suit. I didn't have any clothes to change into last night, so I grabbed something from the closet. Jessi, what's wrong?""

Jessica thought, 'What's wrong? A woman who doesn't belong in this house is wearing my clothes, making breakfast for my kid and grinding coffee for my husband‚Äîand she's asking me what's wrong?'

Brian seemed to sense Jessica was about to cause trouble again. He frowned and spoke first, ""Jessica, it's just clothes. Don't make a scene. I gave you a black card. You can go buy a hundred more.""

Hearing that, Jessica couldn't help but let out a snort. Her stomach turned. She couldn't even tell if it was the pregnancy or the fact that she hadn't eaten breakfast. ""Brian, did you forget that this piece was...""

It was the one she wore after the first time they slept together.

Back then, Jessica had been young, fresh out of school, filled with curiosity about the world.

At a business party, she'd thought she could help the company close a billion-dollar deal. She'd drunk too much with the client, only to realize later that her drink had been spiked. She'd ended up in bed with the company's CEO by mistake.

The next morning, she'd woken up to find her clothes torn to shreds by Brian. She couldn't go to work and had sat on the bed, blushing in frustration.

Brian had found her reaction cute and had his assistant buy her that custom-tailored suit. After that, he'd reassigned her to be his personal secretary.

Jessica remembered it clearly. That was how everything started between them.

She didn't expect Brian to forget. And now he let Madeline wear the very same outfit she once wore‚Äîit was disgusting.

Brian looked at Jessica's face, seeing she was holding something back. He gave a mocking smile, his deep-set eyes flashing with something strange. ""What is it? Say it. Jessica, are you really that attached to a piece of clothing?""

Madeline quickly sensed the tension in the air. She rushed over to explain, grabbed Jessica's hand tightly, and pleaded with her, her eyes brimming with tears, ""Jessi, don't be mad at Mr. Atkinson. He didn't know. I took it on my own.

""Are you sure about this, Sienna?"" Outside the airport terminal, a woman in a chic white suit clutched Sienna's hand, her own trembling.

""You don't have to go back to Solara,"" she begged. Her blonde hair and blue eyes were swimming with a desperate plea. ""Please. Stay here, with us.""

Sienna Hart, a vision of cool elegance, met her foster mother's gaze. She pulled her into a deep, meaningful hug, her own eyes stinging.

""I have to go back, Mom,"" she said softly. ""But I'll be back. I promise.""

But as the plane taxied down the runway, she knew this was a promise she might not be able to keep.

Three days ago, the dam of her memory had broken. Ten years, washed away in an instant, revealing the truth of who she was.

She remembered she was Sienna Hart, eldest daughter of the prestigious Hart family of Vallaris.

At eighteen, a trip abroad had ended in a fiery plane crash. By some miracle, she survived, only to be found by a kind couple who, believing she had no one, adopted her and raised her as their own.

Now, at twenty-eight, the past had come rushing back. Her family was alive. The weight of that knowledge was a moral compass she couldn't ignore. She had to go home.

The flight was long, but sleep was a distant stranger. Sienna spent the hours piecing together the fractured memories of her family. It all felt like a bizarre, vivid dream from another lifetime.

\*\*\*\*\*

At ten past 10 at night, Sienna finally arrived in Vallaris. She hailed a cab, and the driver greeted her with thick Vallaris accent. ""Where to, Miss?""

A faint smile touched her lips. ""88 Maplecrest Avenue, please.""

""Well, I'll be,"" the driver said, catching her accent. ""You don't look local. I thought you were a tourist.""

Sienna's smile widened. ""I'm from here. It's just‚Ä¶ ""

The smile faltered, a shadow of old pain and fresh hope passing through her eyes. ""It's been a long time.""

Ten years. A lifetime. Everything she knew was gone. She found herself thinking about her three little sisters‚Äîthe giggles, the late-night chats, the way they used to huddle together on cold nights. 'Where are they now?' she wondered. 'Are they doing okay?'

As she sank into her memories, the driver kept chattering on how kids these days didn't visit their parents enough. He didn't stop talking until they finally pulled up to the address.

But as Sienna stepped out of the car, her eyes landed on a club she didn't recognize‚ÄîCharmvale. She stared at the sign, her brow knitting together. The name felt strange in her mouth. The world had really gone on without her.

Just as she turned to leave, a heated argument at the club's entrance caught her eye. A man stood there, hands buried in his pockets lazily. He had the kind of face that spelled heartbreak, and his voice cut through the air like a blade, laced with cold indifference.

""Get it through your head,"" he was speaking to a young girl, who looked painfully thin in her simple dress. ""You're a stand-in. A substitute. Do I have to spell it out for you?""

The girl's eyes were rimmed with red, her pretty face blotched with tears. ""Mason, I already told you,"" she replied. ""I'm not feeling well, so I'm not going to the hospital to donate blood today.""

""Not feeling well?"" Mason Quinn let out a cruel laugh. He grabbed her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. ""Is that why you're here, selling drinks? Or is it something else you're selling, Vivian?""

Vivian Hart's jaw tightened. With a sharp crack, her hand flew across his face.

""You're a monster, Mason,"" she spat, her voice trembling with rage. ""I've paid my debts. We're done. Now get away from me!""

Mason's head snapped to the side from the blow, but the cold grin never left his face. ""You don't get to decide when we're done,"" he scoffed. ""Did you forget? If it weren't for my family's engagement to yours three years ago, the Harts would've gone under. You want to walk away? Be my guest. But I wonder what your father would have to say about that.""

With that, he grabbed her arm, and started dragging her toward his car. ""If you want to keep playing the part of my fianc√©e, you'll do as you're told. Chloe needs your blood. It's the only thing you're good for, after all.""

A wave of utter despair washed over Vivian. She closed her eyes, defeated.

To her, it had always been this way. Three years ago, she'd believed he was her savior. She'd thought he truly cared. But it was all a lie. Mason had only seen her as a walking, breathing medicine cabinet for Chloe Zalton, the one he actually loved.

In the name of ""treatment,"" she had to go every month to donate blood for Chloe. And when she tried to put a stop to it, her own father slapped her for even bringing it up.

Just as Vivian was about to be pushed into the car, a cold, cutting voice sliced through the night. ""Let her go.""

Mason froze, turning to face a woman whose beauty was as breathtaking as the steel in her gaze.

""Who are you?"" Mason scowled. ""This is a private matter.""

But when Vivian heard that voice, the world seemed to shift beneath her feet. It was a voice she recognized deep in her soul, a voice from a life she believed had vanished forever.

She looked up, her body rigid with disbelief. The face‚Äîso familiar, so regal, so achingly missed‚Äîsent a tremor through her heart.

A trembling hand reached out, her own face a mask of shock. Her lips parted, and a single, fragile word escaped, a name she'd only dared to whisper in her dreams.

""Sienna?"" she mumbled. ""Is that you?""

Sienna's gaze softened as she looked at the broken girl before her. Vivian, her second sister, had been just fifteen when Sienna left. Now grown, she still carried that same spark in her eyes.

""It's me, Vivian,"" Sienna said, her voice a gentle balm. ""I'm back.""

""Sis!""

Vivian ripped her arm from Mason's grasp and threw herself into Sienna's embrace, sobbing as if her heart would break.

All the years of pain, of loneliness, of quiet desperation, came pouring out. She clung to Sienna like a drowning girl to a lifeline, shaking with fear that this was all a dream, another cruel trick of her mind.

Sienna held her tight, stroking her back. Her voice was a steady, warm anchor in the storm.

""It's okay,"" she murmured. ""I'm here now. I'm back, and I'm not going anywhere.""

Vivian cried until Sienna's shoulder was soaked, finally pulling back with a sniffle of embarrassment, her eyes puffy and red.

""Is this real?"" she whispered. ""You're really here? Am I still dreaming?""

Sienna's heart ached. ""It's real, Vivian. I'm really back."" And she swore she would burn the world to the ground before she ever left her again.

Meanwhile, Mason, who had been ignored for so long, was now utterly confused. 'Sis?' he wondered. 'Vivian didn't have a sister. She was the eldest‚Ä¶ wasn't she?'

""Vivian, are you done with this melodrama?"" he chimed in. ""We're leaving. Now.""

But before he could finish the sentence, another sharp smack echoed in the night air. Mason stumbled, his head whipping to the side.

Sienna had hit him hard, without holding back. She'd been listening to his vile performance, her fury coiled like a snake in her gut.

What a joke,' Sienna thought. 'A substitute? Forced blood donations? What kind of sick, primetime drama is this?'

Then Mason called out Vivian's name, and Sienna strode forward. Though ten years had passed, she recognized Vivian instantly. Her pitiful, vulnerable look tugged at Sienna's heart.

Bullying her family right in front of her? To Sienna, that was the last straw. Mason might as well have been asking for trouble.

""What are you doing? Do you have any idea who I am?"" cried Mason. The slap had left him dazed, his cheek was numb and painful. ""I'm Vivian's boyfriend! Who do you think you are?""

Mason glared at the woman before him, but his bravado quickly faded. The woman standing there radiated a power that was genuinely terrifying. A cold dread crept over him.

""I'm her sister,"" Sienna pulled Vivian behind her, her voice deadly calm. ""And you just laid a hand on my family. So, tell me. Do you want to leave here walking, or crawling?""

Vivian sniffled, the fear instantly replaced by a surge of strength. Sienna was a fortress, and inside her walls, nothing could touch her.

""Sienna, I hate him,"" she whimpered, clinging to Sienna's arm. ""He's a bully.""

That was all Sienna needed to hear. She drove her foot into Mason's stomach, sending him sprawling to the pavement again.

""You‚Ä¶ you'll pay for this!"" Mason gasped, yet he could do nothing but scramble away.

# 2.Chapter 2 A Gilded Cage No More

Steering Vivian away from the chaos, Sienna stopped at a quiet corner and gently dabbed at the lingering tears on her cheeks.

Vivian was not so short, but next to Sienna with those heels on, she looked as fragile as a porcelain doll.

""Don't cry, Vivian,"" Sienna said softly. ""Tell me what happened. Tell me everything.""

Vivian's shoulders shook with silent sobs. She didn't want to cry, but the injustice of it all was overwhelming.

Everyone had told her Sienna was dead‚Äîgone for ten years, a full decade of silence. But she never believed it. There were so many things she wanted to ask her.

Seeing Vivian so upset, Sienna decided to take her somewhere quiet to eat and talk. She took her to a cozy diner and ordered steaks for both of them. As the hot food arrived, Vivian's storm of emotions began to calm.

""Sienna‚Ä¶ where were you these years?"" she wiped her face clean and finally asked the question that had been haunting her for years, ""They all said you were dead‚Ä¶ ""

Vivian had never believed it‚Äînor had the other sisters. Not the official story about the plane crash. But after ten years without a single word, even the strongest hope begins to fade.

A wave of guilt washed over Sienna. ""I thought I was dead, too,"" she admitted. ""By some miracle, I survived. A kind couple found me, adopted me.""

Watching Vivian's expression closely, she slowly continued, ""But I had amnesia. For ten years, I didn't know who I was. Then, three days ago, everything came rushing back. The moment it did, I booked a flight home to find you.""

Amnesia. That single word wiped away a decade of resentment. All the anger Vivian had held onto‚Äîfor being abandoned, for being left alone‚Äîseemed to vanish into thin air.

""It's our fault. We should've found you sooner‚Ä¶"" Vivian's voice cracked as she looked across the table at Sienna, scared she might disappear like a ghost.

""Enough of that,"" Sienna said gently but firmly. ""Now, tell me about that Mason.""

""He's my ex. But we're over now,"" Vivian said, a little too quickly. She couldn't bear for Sienna to know the whole, humiliating story. ""Speaking of that, how about staying with me tonight?""

Sienna didn't push. If Vivian wouldn't tell her, she'd find out on her own. And anyone who had hurt her family would learn the true meaning of regret.

After they finished eating and talked a bit more, they left the diner. When they arrived at the address Vivian had given, Sienna stopped in her tracks. The building was a rundown walk-up in a rough part of town.

""Vivian, this is where you live?"" she asked, disbelief clear in her voice.

Their family home was a sprawling villa at No. 1 Southlake. Why was Vivian living here? Was this some misguided attempt at independence? Sienna felt a knot of confusion tighten in her chest.

Vivian couldn't meet her eyes. She had been thrown out of her home seven years ago. How could she possibly explain that?

""It's not so bad. Come on, let's go up!"" she said, leading Sienna upstairs.

Sienna followed silently, swallowing her questions. Just as Vivian reached for the door, a portly, greasy-looking man stepped forward, blocking their way.

""Vivian! Late on the rent again, I see,"" he boomed. ""You're six months behind! With utilities, you owe me two thousand bucks! And now you're bringing guests? Pay up!""

Vivian froze, her face a mixture of panic and shame as she glanced between the landlord and Sienna. She prayed he would just shut up.

""I've been patient with you, you know, 'cause you're a pretty little thing,"" the landlord continued. ""But you're pushing your luck! A girl who looks like you can't scrape together two grand? What a waste.""

His eyes roamed over Vivian with a possessive leer that sent a chill down Sienna's spine. It was clear he expected payment of a different kind, not money.

Just as Vivian opened her mouth to protest, Sienna stepped forward. She pulled a thick wad of cash from her purse and slammed it into the man's chest.

""Here's the rent,"" she said, her voice dripping with ice. ""Now get out of my sight before I do something we'll both regret.""

""Hey! Who do you think you are?"" the landlord sputtered, stunned by the cash. But before he could say more, Sienna had pulled Vivian inside and bolted the door.

""Sienna, I‚Ä¶"" Vivian stared at the floor, unable to look at the sister she'd always worshipped.

Sienna said nothing. She calmly set down her luggage, cracked open a window to let in the cool night air, and switched on the light.

The room was tiny, the furniture old, the walls peeling. But it was tidy and had a certain warmth to it. It was obviously a home, one Vivian had lived in for a long, long time.

She then turned to Vivian, studying her expression carefully for a moment. Her face was still sweet and round, her big, bright eyes just as striking as when she was little. Her long, straight hair fell like a curtain as she hung her head in shame.

In the end, Sienna simply opened her suitcase and asked, ""Do you want to shower first, or should I?""

""Huh?"" Vivian's mind went blank.

She'd been desperately trying to come up with a believable lie, a story to explain everything. But that simple, everyday question caught her completely off guard. She'd expected accusations. Demands. Not this.

She blinked, watching as Sienna picked up a silk pajama set and walked toward her. Then, without thinking, she squeezed her eyes shut.

She must be mad. She's going to hit me,' Vivian thought. 'And honestly‚Ä¶ I deserve it. I'm so useless.'

She began to replay everything in her mind. After Sienna left, nothing stayed‚Äîshe couldn't even go home. Their mother's belongings had all been taken over by that woman, and their father had changed too, twisted into someone unrecognizable.

It felt like she couldn't protect anything. Not even the Bartholomew Bear Sienna had loved so much‚Äîshe hadn't managed to save that either. Her younger sisters had scattered, pulled in different directions, and she‚Ä¶ she had failed them all.

But the slap never came. Instead, a gentle hand began to stroke her hair. Vivian's eyes shot open. Sienna was looking down at her, a soft smile on her face that seemed to warm the entire room, chasing away the shadows in Vivian's heart.

""You need a minute? I'll go first, then,"" Sienna said softly, and disappeared into the bathroom.

Vivian stood there, dazed, a slow, brilliant smile blooming across her face. She stared at the closed bathroom door, her heart filling with a feeling she hadn't known in ten years‚Äîhope.

A few minutes later, Sienna stepped out, wrapped in a cloud of steam and the soft scent of body lotion. Her skin glowed, and a silky, moon-white nightgown draped effortlessly over her graceful frame. Curls spilled over her shoulders, damp and tousled. She looked like she'd walked straight out of a dream.

Drying her hair with a towel, she caught Vivian staring, wide-eyed. Sienna let out a soft laugh and reached over to give her cheek a gentle, teasing pinch. ""Your turn, Vivian.""

Vivian blushed deep red, wishing she could sink right through the floor. She watched as Sienna sat down on the edge of the bed, and somehow, the drab little apartment seemed to change. The peeling walls, the dim light‚Ä¶it all faded into the background.

In that moment, the whole room felt like it had been made just to frame her. Sienna didn't belong in a place like this. She made it look like a palace.

Vivian's heart hammered in her chest. Sienna was even more beautiful than she remembered.

She really admired her‚Äîthose curves, that graceful figure, the way she carried herself. Even as a girl, Vivian couldn't help but be a little jealous. She wondered if, all these years alone, any slimy men had tried to take advantage of her.

Just thinking about it made her blood boil, and her cheeks would puff up in frustration‚Äîlike now, fresh out of the shower, looking like a little pufferfish.

# 3.Chapter 3 The First Night Home

Sienna had already dried her own hair and was leaning back against the headboard. Her expression was unreadable as she stared out the window, but when Vivian emerged from the bathroom, her gaze softened right away.

""Come here, Vivian,"" she patted the spot beside her. ""Let me dry your hair.""

Vivian wanted to refuse. Sienna had just come back, and she didn't want to trouble her. But Sienna's gentle, soothing voice drew her in before she could say no.

Before she knew it, she was sitting on the floor, leaning back with her head resting in Sienna's lap as the warm air from the hairdryer surrounded her.

It felt‚Ä¶ so safe, Vivian thought. Her eyes fluttered closed in contentment, but then snapped open again.

She was terrified this was all a dream, a beautiful, fragile fantasy she would wake from at any moment. She drank in the sight of Sienna's face, her heart aching with a desperate question.

""Sienna,"" she asked, her voice barely a whisper. ""Are you going to leave again?""

Sienna's hands paused for a moment. ""No,"" she said softly but firmly. ""I'm not going anywhere.""

She had made up her mind. From now on, wherever she went, she would bring her sisters along.

Hearing this, a pure, overwhelming joy blossomed in Vivian's chest. Tears slipped down her cheeks, and Sienna reached down to wipe them away.

She knew Vivian must have suffered unimaginable pain in the years she was gone. She wouldn't press her for details. Not yet.

The rest of her life would be free of suffering, Sienna vowed silently. Because she was here now.

""Alright, go get the hand cream from my suitcase,"" she gently patted on Vivian's shoulder.

""Okay!"" Vivian bounced up, grabbing a pink tube from the suitcase. She watched curiously as Sienna uncapped it.

""Here,"" Sienna said. ""Give me your hands.""

Vivian held them out, and the cool touch of the white lotion against her skin felt like a spark to her heart.

""You have to take care of yourself,"" Sienna said gently as she rubbed the hand cream into Vivian's hands. ""That includes your hands, of course.""

Tears welled in Vivian's eyes as she bit her lip, trying to hold them back. She couldn't let herself cry again. She didn't want to push Sienna away.

She just gave a faint nod, her throat closing up. The cream smelled lovely, a gentle blend of fruit, flowers, and a trace of tea that lingered without being too sweet.

""This smells amazing,"" Vivian exclaimed, her eyes lighting up.

Sienna smiled. ""Just something I whipped up myself. If you like it, it's yours. Use it every morning and night.""

Vivian's face flushed. She shook her head quickly. ""No, I couldn't. It's yours.""

Before she could finish, Sienna pinched her cheek again. ""What's mine is yours. Now, put it away and get some sleep.""

Vivian nodded, slipping under the covers and immediately plastering herself to Sienna's side, clinging to her arm.

Just like when they were children, Sienna held her, patting her back gently until her breathing evened out.

It was the most peaceful night's sleep Vivian had had in ten years, wrapped in her sister's arms, just like old times.

Sienna was really home. She couldn't be more happy.

""Sienna‚Ä¶"" Vivian murmured in her sleep.

Sienna, her own eyes wide open in the darkness, gazed down at her. The carefully constructed dam around her own emotions finally broke, and a single, hot tear traced a path down her cheek.

Later that night, once she was sure Vivian was sound asleep, Sienna carefully slipped out of bed, and stepped over to the window to dial a number.

""It's me,"" she said to the phone, her voice cool and clipped. ""Lana, I need you to check on something. Pack a bag. You're coming to Solara. I'll be here for a while. Hand the company to the board.""

The next day, Vivian woke in a haze, a pleasant dream fading from her mind. Then reality crashed in, and she shot upright.

The other side of the bed was empty.

Was it all a dream? Had Sienna never really come back? She thought, disappointingly.

But then she caught the lingering floral scent on her hands, and her heart leaped with frantic hope.

She scrambled out of bed, her bare feet hitting the cold floor. The clatter of cookware grew louder as she neared the kitchen.

She rounded the corner just in time to see Sienna, wearing an apron, carrying two steaming plates out of the kitchen.

""Already up?"" Sienna asked, raising an eyebrow. ""It's only six. You should be sleeping in.""

Seeing her there‚Äîreal, solid, and right in front of her‚Äîcalmed the wild pounding in Vivian's chest. She didn't say a word, just stared at Sienna for a long moment.

""How many times have I told you? Don't run around without shoes, you'll catch a cold,"" Sienna noticed her bare feet and immediately went into big-sister mode. ""You're not a child anymore. Go put on some socks and slippers, now.""

The familiar nagging was the warmest sound Vivian had ever heard. She sniffled, nodding vigorously. ""Okay. I'll go get them right now.""

""Slippers and socks, then wash up,"" Sienna added. ""Breakfast is almost ready.""

""Okay!"" Vivian replied.

While abroad, Sienna's adoptive parents had hired a renowned chef from Solara to cater to her tastes. She had learned a few breakfast recipes herself, dishes that were both delicious and nourishing.

Watching Vivian dig into the food the moment they sat down, Sienna figured it must have turned out all right.

""Slow down,"" she said with a smile. ""No one's going to steal it from you.""

Vivian took a huge bite of the eggs. ""But this is just so good!""

""Here,"" Sienna passed her a napkin. ""So, Vivian, are you working now?""

The light in Vivian's eyes dimmed instantly. Her gaze shifted, a flicker of shame crossing her face, but she answered truthfully. ""Yes. I work at a company called Dynastis.""

""Dynastis? Fine."" Sienna just ruffled her hair. ""I'll give you a ride there later.""

As the second daughter of the Hart family, Vivna could have lived a life of leisure, coasting on the inheritance their mother had left them, but Sienna didn't ask why she was working.

There were so many questions, yet Sienna just held them back. She had already sent people to find the answers.

By the end of the day, she'd know everything. Her sisters might not say a word, but that didn't mean she, as their older sister, would stay in the dark. And if she found out anyone had laid a hand on them, she would make them pray for a quick death.

""No, Sienna, you don't have to!"" Vivian protested. ""You should rest. I can take the bus, it's really fast.""

Sienna gave a wry smile. ""Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?""

Vivian's eyes went wide. She shook her head frantically. ""No! Not at all! I would never think that! I just‚Ä¶ I don't want to trouble you.""

She looked down, ashamed. The truth is, she was afraid she would embarrass Sienna. At Dynastis, she was just‚Ä¶ a nobody.

""I'm your sister. It's never a trouble,"" Sienna replied. As she spoke, her phone rang. She picked it up and stepped aside while Vivian continued her breakfast.

""It's me,"" she said firmly into the phone. After a brief pause, she finally added, ""Good. Understood.""

When they went downstairs, the portly landlord was waiting, his face split in a sycophantic grin. He greeted them with an enthusiasm that was a world away from his venomous tirade the day before. His eyes, however, lingered disgustingly where they shouldn't.

Sienna shot him a look so sharp and cold it could have cut glass. The man's smile froze, and a flicker of fear entered his eyes. He quickly looked away.

I'll deal with you later, Sienna thought, her eyes turning to ice.

She led Vivian outside the building. Parked beside the shabby apartment building was a crimson Rolls-Royce. Vivian couldn't help but stare.

She didn't know much about cars, but she knew this one was custom, and its price tag would have more commas than she could count. It was so out of place it was almost comical.

""Come on,"" Sienna said, walking towards it. ""Get in.""

""Huh?"" Vivian blinked in surprise. Get in? She processed her words. The only other vehicle nearby was a shared bike. Was Sienna planning to pedal her to work?

Confused but obedient, she started walking toward the bike. Sienna sighed, grabbed her hand, and pulled her toward the luxury car.

""This way. Get in,"" said Sienna. ""Or you'll be late.""

# 4.Chapter 4 A Game Of Push And Pull

Vivian stared at the open car door, her mouth agape. She looked from the car to Sienna and back again, swallowing hard.

""Wait, Sienna,"" she pointed a trembling finger. ""Is this car yours?""

""Yes,"" Sienna nodded. ""If you like it, it's yours. By the way, do you know how to drive?""

Vivian just shook her head, still trying to process it. One moment, Sienna owned a Rolls-Royce, and the next, she was offering to let her drive it. This was just too much.

Before her brain could fully process it, her body was already moving, sinking into the plush leather of the passenger seat. They'd been driving for a few minutes before the reality finally hit her.

""Sienna!"" Vivian exclaimed, her voice buzzing with excitement. ""This is really your car! Where did you get all this money? Oh‚Äîwait, that's not what I meant. You're incredible, of course you'd be successful!""

But this was beyond successful. She screamed inside. This car had to be worth a hundred or two hundred million, at least!

Sienna just smiled, the morning light catching the angles of her exquisite face. ""You really think I'm that capable?""

""Of course!"" Vivian declared proudly. ""You are the most brilliant woman in the entire world! You've always been my idol.""

From a young age, Sienna had been a prodigy. She was always first in her class, with perfect scores in every subject. She'd been the top when applying for college.

And as for looks, she had been crowned the number one beauty in Vallaris. Their entire family was blessed with good genes; their mother and grandmother were both legendary beauties and scholars in their own right.

""You're amazing too,"" Sienna said quietly.

The simple words made Vivian freeze, her heart skipping a beat.

Me? Amazing? she wondered silently. But she had let Sienna down. She felt like a failure.

""You can just drop me off at the corner up ahead,"" she said, her voice suddenly small. ""My office is just a short walk from there.""

""Alright,"" Sienna agreed, pulling the car over. A message notification lit up her phone. It was Lana. Who had just arrived Vallaris.

""What time do you get off? I'll pick you up,"" Sienna said, handing Vivian a sleek black business card. ""Here's my number. Take it.""

Vivian nodded, quickly adding the contact, labeling it simply: Sienna.

She walked toward her office, her heart light and happy. But then she spotted someone standing guard at the company entrance‚ÄîMason, dressed in a sharp blue suit. He kept glancing at his watch, his expression tight with impatience.

Vivian knew he was waiting for her, but she ignored him and walked straight past.

""Vivian!"" Mason's voice snapped as he saw her pass without so much as a glance. Anger flared inside him, but Vivian didn't break her stride‚Äîshe walked straight into the building.

Furious, Mason grabbed her arm, yanking her back. ""Have I been too good to you? You dare to ignore me?"" he roared. ""You think just because someone helped you last night, you can defy me?""

Vivian shook him off. ""Mason, we're broken up. From now on, we have nothing to do with each other. Stay away from me.""

Mason was momentarily speechless. He took a breath, trying to regain control. ""Look, I'm giving you one last chance. Apologize, come to the hospital with me right now, and I'll still be your boyfriend.""

Vivian didn't answer but let out a scornful laugh.

This was the man she once thought she loved. When she first met him, she'd been drawn to his seemingly endless kindness. He had been a light in her darkness, giving her the courage to live when she felt most helpless.

But in the end, he had wounded her again and again. The moment his precious Chloe Zalton so much as whimpered, it was always Vivian's fault.

""Mason, you're delusional. Starting today, I will never donate another drop of my blood to Chloe,"" replied Vivian. ""Get that through your head. Your family has always wanted to call off the engagement, right? Fine. Let's do it. I don't want the title of your fianc√©e anyway.""

Sienna was back. Vivian knew she didn't have to be afraid of anyone.

Mason sneered. ""Vivian, there's a limit to these games. Did you really think a pathetic little trick like this would work on me? I have a gala tonight. Be there.""

With that, he turned and left, confident in his victory. He believed Vivian couldn't break up with him. She loved him too much. How could she possibly want to end the engagement?

It was just a game of push and pull, he told himself. A way to get attention. All women were like that.

Vivian rolled her eyes. She brushed off the sleeve he had touched, her expression one of utter disgust. 'Mason, how stupid was I to ever give you the impression that I couldn't live without you?' she sighed quietly, then headed back to her office.

Meanwhile, inside Vivian's rented apartment, a glass shattered against the wall. Several documents lay scattered across the table. Standing before Sienna was a woman with blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, dressed in a sharp black business suit.

""S‚Äî"" the woman called out, but Sienna cut her off.

""I told you,"" Sienna said, her voice dangerously low. ""From now on, you will call me Miss Enna. And I don't want my identity revealed. I trust you understand that.""

""Yes, Miss Enna. My apologies,"" Lana Yost, Sienna's assistant for years, replied quickly.

Sienna clentched her fist, eyes blazing with fury. 'Aiden, how dare you treat Vivian like that?' she muttered under her breath. 'You're dead. Just wait‚Äîtonight, I'll make you wish you'd never been born.'

""Miss Enna, shall I acquire the Hart Corporation?"" Lana chimed in. ""It's in chaos right now, and its development has stagnated. It would take half a month at most.""

Sienna waved her hand dismissively, her cool, indifferent eyes glinting like sharp ice. ""Not yet. For now, buy up this entire block. And put this building in Vivian Hart's name.""

""Yes, Miss Enna,"" Lana replied. As she turned to leave, Sienna stopped her. ""One more thing.""

Lana nodded, ""Yes, Miss Enna?""

""Throw this out,"" Sienna carefully wrapped the shards of broken glass in a handkerchief. ""And buy me a same one.""

Lana was confused. The handkerchief alone was worth ten times more than the cheap glass. But she obeyed without question. Miss Enna always had her reasons.

Once she'd calmed down, Sienna picked up her phone and sent Vivian a message: \[Are you tired? I'm bringing you a Silkstone Espresso.\]

After getting Sienna's text, Vivian left the building on time to meet her after work. She was usually the ever-compliant one, but this time she was the first to leave‚Äîmuch to her manager's annoyance.

Silkstone Expresson was her favorite drink. Sitting inside Sienna's car, she took the coffee cup and took a sip. A familiar ache, bittersweet and comforting, filled her chest. After Sienna had left, she had never again tasted her favorite drink.

Now she was back, and so was this small piece of happiness.

""Thanks, Sienna."" Vivian grinned, her pure, pretty face radiating joy.

Sienna reached out and brushed her bangs aside. The Harts were all stunning. Vivian had a delicate, beautiful face with the soft lines of an oval shape, gentle brow bones, and large eyes that shone with innocence.

But Sienna knew that Vivian was always too sensible, too used to swallowing her grievances and burying her pain.

""Let's get you a conditioning treatment. Your hair is looking a little frizzy,"" said Sienna. ""Then we'll go to the mall and buy you some new clothes.""

Vivian wanted to refuse, to say she didn't have any money. But she couldn't bring herself to spoil Sienna's mood.

When had she‚ÄîVivian Hart, the second daughter of the family‚Äîbecome so timid? She didn't even understand herself. Maybe it started the day she was thrown out of her home with nothing to her name.

As if sensing her hesitation, Sienna's voice softened.

""Vivian, I know I was gone for ten years. I know you all suffered after I left,"" she added. ""But I promise you, from this day forward, you'll never endure another injustice. So please, don't treat me like a stranger, okay?""

# 5.Chapter 5 The ""Stolen"" Black Card

""No! That's not it. I've never thought that!"" Vivian said, her voice choked with emotion. How could she ever not acknowledge her sister? Even in death, she would never disown Sienna. ""I just don't want to be a bother. I'm sorry.""

Sienna's expression softened. ""From now on, you tell me everything. We're family. There's no such thing as being a 'bother.' You girls are the only family I have left. If you push me away, I don't know what I came back for.""

Vivian's eyes filled with tears as she nodded fiercely.

After a luxurious hair treatment, they headed straight to the mall. Sienna stepped away to take a call, leaving Vivian to browse and try on clothes on her own.

Then, out of nowhere, two women walked in. Their eyes locked onto Vivian, surprise flashing across their faces before twisting into matching sneers of contempt.

The perfect dress, the perfect venue, the perfect man. But as I stood in front of the mirror in the bridal suite, staring at my own reflection, I realized how foolish I had been.

The perfect man didn‚Äôt exist‚Äîat least, not in the form of Peter Knox.

My fingers trembled as I clutched my phone, the images displayed on the screen. Peter, my fianc√©. Peter, the man I had loved for years. He was in bed with another woman‚Äînaked. My stomach churned, anger and heartbreak warring inside me, but there was no time for tears, I‚Äôd cried enough from the time I found out last week.

A sharp knock at the door pulled me from my thoughts. Emily, my best friend, peeked inside, her expression tight with worry.

‚ÄúFreya‚Ä¶ are you sure about this?‚Äù She asked her lips twisted into a deep frown, she‚Äôd tried to talk me out of what I was about to do, she‚Äôd pleaded asking me to just walk away from everything without causing a big scene but I didn‚Äôt listen, Peter had humiliated me with no regard for my feelings or my reputation, so I was going to do the same to him, he was going to have a taste of his own medicine.

‚ÄúAbsolutely,‚Äù I nodded taking a deep breath and forcing steel into my spine.

With one last glance at my reflection, I lifted my chin, straightened my veil, and walked out.

The venue was stunning‚Äîwhite roses lined the aisle, soft music floated through the air, and hundreds of guests waited with eager smiles, everything was the way I‚Äôd envisioned it to be when I got married, but sadly I wasn‚Äôt here to get married. Not anymore.

As I stepped into the aisle, a the crowd went quiet as they stood from their seats. Peter stood at the altar, looking handsome as ever in his tailored black suit and for a brief moment, I wondered how I‚Äôd been such a fool not to see beneath his nice guy act and how many people had seen the same charming smile and fallen for the same lies.

Seeing how happy he looked angered me so much to the point I had to clench my bouquet tightly to keep myself from lunging forward and punching him the smile off his stupid face.

When I reached the end, instead walking to my husband who was waiting for me, I climbed on the stage we‚Äôd set up and turned to face the audience instead of my soon to be husband. My heart pounded as I pulled out a small remote from the folds of my dress and with one click, the massive screen behind us, the same one that was supposed to play a short video of memories him and I had shared throughout the course of our relationship flickered to life.

The room collectively gasped causing Peter to turn around.

Photo after photo flashed on the screen‚Äîhim kissing his mistress, their intimate dates, and sex escapades. Every betrayal, every lie was laid bare for the world to see.

‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen,‚Äù I said, my voice shockingly steady, ‚Äúthere will be no wedding today.‚Äù I turned to Peter, whose face had drained of all color. ‚ÄúBecause my fianc√© decided to have an early celebration, with someone else.‚Äù

Murmurs erupted around us and Peter‚Äôs shock soon turned into fury as he stormed toward me grabbing the remote and attempting to turn the screen off, but failed.

‚ÄúFreya, stop this‚Äî‚Äù He glared.

Annoyed by his audacity to still be making demands, I met him with a sharp slap the sound ringing through the hall making the crowd gasped, and Peter stagger back, his hand flying to his cheek.

‚ÄúWhat the hell!‚Äù He hissed, his eyes burning with anger. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre embarrassing me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs rich, Peter. Did you think I‚Äôd just smile and go through with the wedding after seeing you in bed with her?‚Äù I gestured toward the screen, where his mistress‚Äôs face was still on display, frozen mid-kiss.

His jaw clenched, and for a second, I thought he might actually try to deny it, but then his lips curled into a small sneer that disappeared as quickly as it came and was replaced with a look of embarrassment and fake remorse‚ÄîHe wanted to fool everyone into thinking he felt guilty for what he had done, but after his initial reaction I knew better, the bastard had no care in the world that I‚Äôd found out.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making a scene, Freya. Be rational.‚Äù He sighed slightly glaring at me. ‚ÄúAll this drama, on our wedding day is uncalled for, let‚Äôs just talk things out in private like mature adults.‚Äù He tried again.

‚ÄúNo mature adult will be sleeping around with other people when they are in a committed relationship with someone.‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nothing but a lying, cheating asshole.‚Äù

‚ÄúFreya, you‚Äôre humiliating me!‚Äù He finally snapped. ‚ÄúStop this now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou humiliated me too Peter!‚Äù I volleyed with the same anger.

‚ÄúYou still love me,‚Äù He snarled confidently. ‚ÄúSo stop all this drama.‚Äù

The arrogance in his voice made me want to slap him again, but I didn‚Äôt, the ache I‚Äôd get in my hand afterwards was not going to be worth it, he wasn‚Äôt worth it and had I seen it sooner, maybe, just maybe my heart wouldn‚Äôt have been aching or feeling like my heart had been torn into a million shreds. I was still in pain but I wasn‚Äôt going to let him see the pain he‚Äôd caused me.

‚ÄúNo, Peter,‚Äù My voice rang out, strong as I took a step closer and looked him dead in the eyes. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt love you anymore, I stopped the second I found out you were cheating on me, you betrayed me you asshole. The only reason I walked down that aisle was to make sure you felt the same humiliation you put me through.‚Äù

The whispers in the crowd grew louder causing Peter to tighten his fists at his sides as he glared at me, the look of anger and embarrassment heavy in his eyes. He was so obsessed with what people thought about him that he‚Äôd try anything to have everyone thinking he was some upright bastard that did everything right.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry ok, I made a mistake, now can we move past this and get married already, we‚Äôll talk about this later.‚Äù He said desperation thick in his tone as he run a hand through his hair.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt make a mistake Peter, you made a choice, and for that, there is no wedding, because I‚Äôve made a choice too,‚Äù I spat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve moved on.‚Äù

‚ÄúHa-ha-ha real funny Freya,‚Äù He rolled his eyes clearly not taking what I had said seriously.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious,‚Äù I stated folding my hands across my chest to show him that I was indeed serious.

¬†‚ÄúOh yeah? With who?‚Äù He scoffed.

A slow smile spread across my lips at his question‚Äîthis was my time to hurt him back and I wasn‚Äôt going to let it slip through my fingers.

‚ÄúWith a man who actually loves me. Who cares for me. Who adores me. A man who doesn‚Äôt lie, doesn‚Äôt cheat, and doesn‚Äôt make a fool out of the woman he‚Äôs supposed to cherish.‚Äù I told him.

And then, as if fate had scripted the moment, my eyes landed on a man standing beside my father whose cold, piercing silver-grey eyes were already on me. He didn‚Äôt seem invested in the chaos like the other guests, No, he was studying it‚Äîstudying me.

So I studied him too, he was tall with broad-shouldered and well-built body that his suit did little to hide. The man was the literal definition of a Greek god, but there was also something about him‚Äîsomething commanding, something dangerous, something different that made me want to give into his every whim that I couldn‚Äôt place a finger on.

Without hesitation, I stepped down from the stage and walked toward him. When I reached, I stood by his side and slid my hand into his without thinking. An electric like wave spark through my body when our palms touched and his fingers instinctively curled around mine as though trying to stop me from pulling away.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the man I love.‚Äù I said lifting my chin and looking straight at Peter.

‚ÄúWhat the hell, Freya ?!‚Äù He snapped his shock morphing into rage. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing with my dad?‚Äù

My breath caught at his words.

Did he just call him DAD?

I slowly turned to the man whose hand I was still holding, then to my father who stood tense beside him with an expression of angry and irritated fixed on his face then back to him, god he was so handsome with his strong jaw and high cheekbones, he looked like someone had sculpted him from stone with the sole purpose of making people forget how to breathe.

¬†And then reality struck like a lightning bolt.

WAIT,

The man I had just chosen, in front of 300 people‚Äîthe man I had never met before‚Äîwas no other than Christian Knox,

Peter‚Äôs father,

Holy shit.

Panic set within me making it harder and harder for me to breathe with each passing second.

What had I just done.

‚ÄúThink fast Freya, think fast,‚Äù I mentally slapped brain forcing it to come up with something.

‚ÄúI-‚Äù I opened my mouth to say something but nothing came out, my attempt to hurt Peter had failed so I opted for the next best thing, accepting defeat. I tried to remove my hand from the man that was supposed to be my father-in-law, but he didn‚Äôt let me, instead Christian tightened his grip on me and pulled me closer letting out a primal growl that sounded as though he was warning me not to try and move away from him.

Instinctively, my head lifted up to look at him, to ask him what the hell he was doing, he was my father-in-law, or was supposed to be.

I opened my mouth to say something to him but before I could even get a word out, an enraged Peter beat me to it.

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù Peter snared shifting his gaze from me, to Christian‚Äôs hand that was tightly griping mine, then to him with disbelief. ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be real, you can‚Äôt really‚Ä¶.you-you-you‚Äôre my father.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am, and this is real,‚Äù Christian spoke his voice so velvety and calm but yet authoritative made shivers run down my spine and goose bumps to form on my skin. ‚ÄúOur relationship, our love, it‚Äôs all real.‚Äù

# 2

‚ÄúOur relationship, it‚Äôs all real.‚Äù Kingsley told Peter and my heart pounded against my chest threatening to jump out of its ribcage.

Peter stared at his father in utter disbelief at his words before his angry gaze shifted to meet mine, and I stared dead into his dark orbs not letting him see any ounce of the fear, anxiety, and shock pumping through my veins and an insane pace.

""For how long?"" He demanded his voice sharp with rage as he glared daggers at me. ""How long have you been sneaking around with my dad behind my fucking back?""

""Watch your tone."" Kingsley exhaled through his nose, patience wearing thin with each passing second.

""Freya this has to be a joke, you can‚Äôt‚Äî"" Peter stuttered his tone was calmer now, but he still looked like he wanted to throw a fit he was trying so hard to keep at bay.

‚ÄúI can, and I have.‚Äù I spat confidently hoping my words would slice his small heart into a gazillion pieces like he had done mine when he cheated on me.

Thick tension enveloped us as we stared at each other, neither one of us wanted to pull away because we were trying to prove a point.

‚ÄúFreya,‚Äù My father‚Äôs voice boomed through the silent hall and I felt myself shrivel like a flower that that been placed in the sun after being plucked.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with you, why would you pull a stunt like this on a day as important as today!‚Äù He barked his face an ugly mix of barely contained fury and humiliation as he stood in front of me.

I swallowed, tightening my grip on Kingsley‚Äôs hand, but he didn‚Äôt react. He didn‚Äôt pull away, didn‚Äôt squeeze back. He was just there, standing beside me like he hadn‚Äôt just been dragged into the most humiliating moment of my life.

""You‚Äôve embarrassed this family,"" my father hissed, stopping just inches away from me. ""Do you have any idea what you‚Äôve done? You‚Äôve turned yourself into a spectacle. A disgrace A bloody joke!""

I was now a joke to everyone.

The words cut deeper than I wanted to admit. I clenched my jaw, forcing myself not to react, not to show him that it hurt. But it did. It hurt because, for all his faults, I had always sought his approval. And now, all I saw in his eyes was disappointment and rage.

""You should‚Äôve come to me and let me handled this privately,"" he went on, voice dripping with frustration. ""Instead, you chose to humiliate Peter in front of everyone‚Äîour business partners, our family. Do you have any idea how this makes us look?""

I let out a short, bitter laugh.

Of course that was all he was worried about, his precious image.

""How it makes you look?"" I echoed. ""Not how it makes me feel? Not how it made me feel when I found out the man I was supposed to marry, that man I‚Äôd given 5 years of my life to was screwing someone else behind my back?""

My father exhaled sharply, pinching the bridge of his nose like I was the problem here for not wanting to understand him.

""I‚Äôm not saying what he did was right, but‚Äî""

""But what?"" I cut him off, voice rising. ""But I should‚Äôve just smiled and walked down that aisle anyway? Played the part of the perfect, obedient daughter while he made a fool out of me?""

""You should‚Äôve thought about the consequences before pulling this stunt."" My father‚Äôs jaw tightened. He looked like he wanted to lunge at me, to grab me and shake me, but he couldn‚Äôt‚Äînot in front of all these people. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a bleeding drama queen! You always have to be extra and not use your brain.‚Äù

Kingsley, who had been silent all this time, suddenly exhaled sharply and ran a hand through his hair, looking like he was already bored of the conversation.

""That‚Äôs enough,"" he said, his voice cold and detached.

His words weren‚Äôt loud.

They weren‚Äôt harsh. But they were final and left no room for anyone no matter how bold they were to protest.

My father‚Äôs mouth snapped shut immediately, but his fury didn‚Äôt disappear‚Äîit burned in his eyes, in the tightness of his fists‚Äîbut he said nothing, he just shook his head at me, his disappointment cutting deeper than any insult could have.

I hated how much it affected me,

How much he still affected me.

Kingsley didn‚Äôt say anything else, didn‚Äôt gloat or taunt like Peter would have. He simply waited, as if the conversation had bored him from the beginning.

""Are you ready to leave?"" He asked his voice filling the heavy silence and snapping me out of my depressing thoughts.

I shook my head no not trusting my voice to come out as strong as it had been earlier. My father‚Äôs words and actions had broken my heart more than Peter‚Äôs cheating had to a point I could feel a sob bubbling in my throat.

My gaze shifted from my father to my ‚Äúwas almost‚Äù husband, Peter who was looking like he wanted to strangle me.

Peter had barely moved, his whole body coiled with fury, his best man now gripping his arm like he was the only thing keeping him from lunging at me.

I inhaled deeply, I moved my arm out of Kingsley‚Äôs and moved towards my ex-fianc√© till I was standing inches from him.

I gracefully raised my hands to my hair and unpinned the cathedral length veil his mother had happily given to me so I could not only wear it on my wedding but also pass it down to my kids one day. As I let the lace material drop to the floor Peter‚Äôs fuming eyes shifted from my face then to the veil the back to me.

‚ÄúYou-‚Äù He started to speak but before he could finish his statement, I hurled the bouquet straight at him and it smacked against his chest before hitting the floor so hard that the petals scattering everywhere.

‚ÄúYou can give that to the woman you‚Äôve been screwing,‚Äù I said in a fake sweet tone, tilting my head. ‚ÄúYou two deserve each other.""

Peter‚Äôs face twisted in rage. His jaw clenched so hard I thought his teeth might shatter but I didn‚Äôt care enough to be bothered by him.

‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm ready to leave.‚Äù I said turning to face Kingsley who was still standing in the same spot with the same bored unbothered expression from earlier.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go then.‚Äù He nodded and took my hand leading me to the exit of the hall.

‚ÄúFreya, you can‚Äôt do this to me!‚Äù Peter snapped charging at us, but before he could reach me, a group of men held him back. ‚ÄúI swear I‚Äôm going to make you pay for this.‚Äù

I tensed slightly at his words and I clenched my fists to avoid myself from letting his threats affect me too much.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù Kingsley grumbled pulling me out of the hall till we reached a black car that was waiting for us.

Kingsley opened the door for me like it was the most natural thing in the world, and I slid in, sinking into the leather seat.

He climbed in after me, and the driver pulled off the moment the door shut.

For a few beats, the only sound was the soft hum of the engine.

""He‚Äôs not going to do anything to you,"" Kingsley said quietly, his voice low and smooth‚Äîlike silk over steel snapping me out of my thoughts and back to reality.

It startled me how easily he could sound calm when my mind was a mix of panic and uncertainty.

""Peter is a very vindictive person,"" I muttered, glancing at him, then turning away and staring out the window as worry began seeping into my bones like a slow, creeping chill.

I knew Peter. He wasn‚Äôt the type to let things go. Especially not when his ego had taken such a public hit, he was going to retaliate, and I‚Äôd feel the pain 10 fold.

""He‚Äôll try to ruin my life, Kingsley. He‚Äôll ruin anything he can get his hands on."" I whispered, tears now forming behind my eyelids.

‚ÄòI should have listened to Mireya, and just walked away.‚Äô I thought to myself.

There was a brief pause, and then he spoke, his voice firmer this time.

‚ÄúHe can try.‚Äù

My head snapped in his direction shocked by his words. Was this man being serious right now?

I stared at him in disbelief of how relaxed he looked leaning back against the seat, but there was something in his eyes‚Äîcold, showing he was in complete control.

""No one touches what‚Äôs mine,"" He stated, his calm expression now morphed into a serious one.

My mouth opened but now words came out, so I ended up closing it.

‚ÄúWhat I meant was, I won‚Äôt let him touch you.‚Äù He quickly corrected, but I didn‚Äôt hear him, my brain was still fixated on what he said at first.

I should‚Äôve laughed. Should‚Äôve rolled my eyes and told him I wasn‚Äôt some possession, but instead‚Ä¶ my chest fluttered.

Mine.

Why did that word send a strange thrill through me?

I looked away, heart pounding for reasons that had nothing to do with fear.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to keep pretending to be my hero,‚Äù I said after a long minute of silence. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve saved me already.‚Äù

His warm fingers wrapped around my chin and my heart nearly stopped beating as jolts of electricity shot up my spin leaving goosebumps all over my skin, thank god it was covered by lace and he couldn‚Äôt see.

‚ÄúWho said I was pretending?‚Äù He asked turning my head into his direction so my gaze could meet his now warm silver eyes.

I opened my mouth‚Ä¶ then shut it again unsure of what to say.

""If anyone tries to hurt you, Freya, I will end them. Whether this thing between us is real or not doesn‚Äôt matter. I said I‚Äôd protect you. I meant it.""

His words, the certainty in his voice and promise in his eyes made it impossible for me to breathe or think he was lying.

The rational part of my brain reminded me that just like every man in my life, he was lying to me, that I should run away before I got hurt again, but, another part of me argued saying this was different, he was different, because I felt something I hadn‚Äôt felt in years‚Äîsafety. I felt safe with him and without reason my heart would skip every time he looked at me with those icy, piercing eyes.

Unsure of what to say, I moved out of his grip and turned back to the window, Kingsley didn‚Äôt say anything else and I was grateful because my brain was too exhausted to form responses to his baffling words. So for the rest of the ride, I sat there in silence trying to ignore the tranquility that came from being next to the man beside me.

It was insane, he was a stranger‚Äîor was he?

# 3

The elevator doors slid open, revealing a penthouse that screamed wealth and luxury like I‚Äôd never seen before, everything in the space was sleek, modern‚Äîblack, grey, and steel. But despite how fancy it was, from the furniture placement to the floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the city skyline bathing the huge lounge in the glow of distant lights, there was no warmth, no sign of a home, just power.

Much like the man who owned it,

Kingsley walked in ahead of me, heading straight for the bar without a word. I remained by the elevator, my heartbeat finally steadying after the whirlwind that had been today. I exhaled slowly, pressing my fingertips to my temples as reality crashed into me, I couldn‚Äôt believe that not only did I actually go through with my insane revenge plan, I took it a step too far‚Äîmaybe a little too far.

‚ÄòWhat the hell was I doing here? Following a man I barley knew?‚Äô I questioned myself.

‚ÄúThat bastard definitely made you lose your mind Freya.‚Äù I mumbled quietly. ‚ÄúJust leave.‚Äù

Taking the advantage that Kingsley still had his back turned to me, I forced myself to try and make an attempt to leave, but before I could even make it back to the elevator, the his voice, smooth and commanding, stopped me dead in my tracks.

‚ÄúStay.‚Äù He said.

It was one word, one damn word, but the weight of it felt so heavy that I even forgot how to breathe.

‚ÄúCalm down Freya, compose yourself.‚Äù I repeated in my head. Once I was composed and my breath and heart rate that suddenly became unrhythmic from the sound of his velvety voice had steadied, I forced myself to turn back to him.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt.‚Äù I whispered fumbling with my manicured nails.

He stared at me for a brief moment before moving his attention to a bottle of liquor and pouring some for himself.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt, or won‚Äôt?‚Äù He quizzed as he casually poured more of the yellowish-brown liquid into the glass in front of him.

‚ÄúBoth.‚Äù I answered confidently folded my arms to show him that I was serious.

‚ÄúAre you saying you regret it?‚Äù He questioned finally turning to face me and his sharp grey eyes that looked colder than they had earlier locked onto mine making me want to shrink but also stare into nothing else for the rest of my life. Like his presence, they were like a magnet sucking me in and I couldn‚Äôt explain why I felt that way, he was a stranger.

I swallowed hard hating how intense his gaze was.

‚ÄúI-I-I-‚Äù I stuttered, but took a quick pause taking in a deep breath before continuing. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt thinking straight. I was consumed by anger and only said I was with you to humiliate and hurt Peter.‚Äù

His face remained unreadable, but there was a slight shift in his posture. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre walking away now?‚Äù

‚ÄúNow that I‚Äôve come to my senses, yes.‚Äù I nodded.

Kingsley set his glass down with precise control and stepped toward me. Too close. I refused to shrink away, even when his presence became suffocating‚Äîtoo suffocating for a stranger. He stared at me for a long moment, and for the first time I saw an emotion I couldn‚Äôt quite place in his orbs but it was gone as soon as it came leaving me with an inconclusive answer of what the emotion was.

‚ÄúMarry me.‚Äù

The words came off so smooth, so calm and so damn casual, that for a second, I thought I‚Äôd imagined them.

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù I said letting out a short, humorless laugh my brain failing to come to process his words.

‚ÄúMarry me.‚Äù He repeated his expression didn‚Äôt change.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre insane,‚Äù I muttered shaking my head in utter disbelief. ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm crazy, but you sir, have lost your mind,‚Äù I added turning for the elevator but his next words stopped me from moving any further steps.

‚ÄúYou wanted revenge, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

My fingers twitched at the reminder of Peter‚Äôs betrayal and I turned back, glaring.

‚ÄúI already got it.‚Äù I shot back.

His silver eyes darkened, his voice a smooth blade. ‚ÄúDid you?‚Äù

The question sliced through me.

I wanted to say yes, that exposing Peter for the cheating bastard he was had been enough. But had it? Was his humiliation equal to the pain he had caused me?

‚ÄúA few moments of public humiliation aren‚Äôt enough to teach a man like Peter a lesson, as we are speaking I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs already balls deep in another woman because he already doesn‚Äôt believe you.‚Äù Kingsley said taking another step forward. ‚ÄúAlso by walking away now, you are only going to be humiliating yourself even further because everyone will know that you lied.‚Äù

My breath caught in my throat.

He was right.

Damn him for knowing exactly how to tempt me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing this. I‚Äôm not going to let hatred control me, I‚Äôm better than that.‚Äù I shook my head looking away from his captivating gaze because the longer I looked at him, the more I felt my senses to reason logically escaped.

Deciding not to let myself get sucked into whatever this thing with Kingsley was, I decided to leave.

‚ÄúThank you for not outing me at the wedding, but I‚Äôm done.‚Äù I said my voice so low I wasn‚Äôt sure he‚Äôd heard me.

With that, I spun toward the elevator, my hand reaching for the button, but before I could press it, a strong hand wrapped around my wrist pulling me back and the second his skin touched mine, a shockwave rippled through my body locking it in place and causing me to suck in a sharp breath. The jolt had sent my pulse into chaos, making every nerve ending in my body come alive at once in a way I‚Äôd never experienced before, but at the same time it wasn‚Äôt pain, wasn‚Äôt heat‚Äîjust intense and unexplainable.

I gasped, my gaze snapping up to his.

And that was when I saw it.

For the first time, Kingsley Knox was as startled as I was, it may have been subtle, the slightest flicker in his silver eyes, but it was there, meaning he had felt it, too.

His grip tightened just a fraction before he let go, his expression smoothing back into perfect control.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I whispered, my hand still tingling where he had touched me.

He didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, he tilted his head, studying me for a long minute with an unreadable expression before he stepped even closer, his voice lower this time, softer even.

‚ÄúFreya, Marry me.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I forced myself to say.

His lips curved slightly, almost amused by my defiance. ‚ÄúThen let me rephrase.‚Äù

He leaned in, his breath warm against my skin. ‚ÄúDo you truly believe Peter has suffered enough for what he did to you?‚Äù

I clenched my jaw, forcing my heartbeat to steady. ‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThink carefully,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúYou gave him a moment of humiliation, just a moment, is that really enough?‚Äù

I bit my lip, refusing to let his words sink in, but damn him, they already had.

He didn‚Äôt give me time to recover before he delivered another blow.

‚ÄúBesides, this won‚Äôt be real. We‚Äôll have a wedding, but it‚Äôll be for show.‚Äù He pressed. ‚ÄúA contract. Nothing more. The only purpose is for you to get your deserved revenge.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, I should have walked away, I should have said no again but I hesitated because he was right. A few minutes of public humiliation didn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd done enough. Not for years of lies, for every time Peter had kissed me while another woman‚Äôs perfume clung to his skin. I needed to settle the score with that scumbag.

Kingsley watched me, his eyes gleaming as if he already knew what I was thinking and what my answer would be.

‚ÄúWhy are you doing this? Why do you want to hurt your own son?‚Äù I exhaled sharply and shook my head.

Something flickered in his gaze, but when he spoke, his voice was smooth, controlled.

‚ÄúBecause I owe it to his father, Daniel entrusted me with the duty to ensure he‚Äôs son grew into a honorable man like he was,‚Äù He responded sincerely. ‚ÄúAnd to be that, he needs to learn how to be a man and value relationships.‚Äù He said simply.

‚ÄúDaniel?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Peter‚Äôs real father.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre not he‚Äôs biological father?‚Äù I quizzed and he nodded his head causing me to scoff. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to.‚Äù He shrugged his lips curved in a slow, knowing smirk.

I hated the way my stomach flipped at the sight of that smirk.

‚ÄòGet a grip Freya, it‚Äôs just a smirk.‚Äô I reprimanded myself.

¬†‚ÄúAll you need to do is trust that I won‚Äôt hurt you.‚Äù He added in a low yet steady voice as he stepped even closer but didn‚Äôt touch me.

For some reason what made my breath hitch was not the offer, the revenge or the thought of the amount to pain it was cause Peter it the quiet, steady promise in his voice and sincerity in his eyes when he indirectly promised that no matter what happened he wouldn‚Äôt hurt me.

‚ÄòSnap out of it Freya, this man is a total stranger, he‚Äôs the angel you don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt trust him.‚Äô I tried to scold myself hoping my heart would somehow stop being delusional and be logical, but it didn‚Äôt work, the more I reprimanded myself, the more I found myself believing and trusting this man.

‚ÄúAnd if at any point you want to stop this, you can. No strings. No consequences.‚Äù He continued his voice as smooth as silk.

I blinked, caught off guard.

He was giving me control, full control.

The offer was too good to be true, and I knew it but I still I remained silent for a long minute, my thoughts tangled in a storm of emotions as I processed each word he had uttered.

Was I really considering this? Marrying my ex-fianc√©‚Äôs father? The idea was beyond insane even for me, but the satisfaction of knowing Peter would lose his mind over it‚Ä¶ that was almost too tempting to ignore.

I had already humiliated him, yes. But Kingsley was right‚Äîa few moments of shame didn‚Äôt even come close to the pain and embarrassment he had put me through, but was I really ready to walk away from the person I‚Äôd loved for 5 years?

I let out a slow breath and looked up at Kingsley.

‚ÄúYou already set the ball in motion when you announced your love for me at the wedding Freya,‚Äù He spoke. ‚ÄúJust keep up the act for a few more weeks before faking argument and calling it quits.‚Äù

I bit hard at inside of my cheek, god I hated this man and how convincing he was. He was manipulating me and I should have been running for the hills, but I wasn‚Äôt, why you may ask, because my hunger for revenge was too strong, Peter had to pay for hurting me.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I sighed after coming to a conclusion that I had nothing else to lose by doing this.

A glimmer of something flickered in his silver eyes, but it was gone before I could place it.

‚ÄúBut let‚Äôs get one thing straight,‚Äù I added, my voice firm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only doing this to get back at your son. Once I think I‚Äôve done enough damage, I‚Äôm calling it quits.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood,‚Äù Kingsley nodded his head slightly, as if he had expected nothing less.

I nodded, sealing my fate. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs settled, then.‚Äù I let out a breathless, almost disbelieving laugh. ‚ÄúWe are getting married.‚Äù

‚ÄòIt was cruel. It was petty. It was the kind of wound that would never heal.‚Äô I thought to myself. ‚ÄòBut if this was also the best and only way to settle the score, then so be it.‚Äô

‚ÄúI know you are mentally deranged and sometimes struggle to think before you act, but this is beyond even you Freya,‚Äù Mireya yelled hysterically throwing her hands in the air as she paced around the room. ‚ÄúHave you finally lost the last thread of sense in your head, should we check you into a mental facility or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine Eya.‚Äù I rolled my eyes at how dramatic she was acting.

I‚Äôd always known my best friend was a drama queen from the second we met when we were 5, and she talked a lot, but today was excessive, she‚Äôd been pacing about the living room of her small apartment and yelling at me from the second she opened the door and found me standing there.

‚ÄúFine people don‚Äôt go around declaring their in love with their fianc√©‚Äôs fathers at their weddings.‚Äù She retorted.

‚ÄúThey do if the said fianc√© cheated and hurt them.‚Äù I volleyed.

At my words, her expression changed into a frown and she sighed before plopping onto the spot next to me.

‚ÄúFreya, I‚Äî‚Äù She exhaled, shaking her head. ‚ÄúAre you seriously doing this for revenge?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice steady so she couldn‚Äôt tell that I was lying. ‚ÄúI was with him before I ever found out about Peter‚Äôs affair.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you have no right to be angry at him.‚Äù Emilia stared at me for a long moment before scoffing, standing up.

My stomach dropped at her words.

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me you were cheating on him too?‚Äù She said crossing her arms.

‚ÄúNo, it wasn‚Äôt like that‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt?‚Äù She arched a brow. ‚ÄúBecause from where I‚Äôm standing, you‚Äôre just as bad as he is.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre supposed to be on my side Mireya,‚Äù I glared not liking how she was accusing me of cheating, though I didn‚Äôt blame her because she didn‚Äôt know the truth, I wanted to, but Kingsley and I had already agreed‚Äîno one could know this was an arrangement, especially not my best friend because if she found out she‚Äôd never let me go through with it.

‚ÄúI am, but I‚Äôm not going to pat you on the back for doing wrong either.‚Äù She retorted.

‚ÄúI came here to avoid my father‚Äôs judgment Mireya, if I wanted to be judged I‚Äôd have just gone home instead,‚Äù I said getting up from the couch. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo ahead, but this conversation isn‚Äôt over, you and I have a lot to tell me, like when you started dating your ex‚Äôs father.‚Äù She called after me as I walked to the bedroom.

Once I got in, I shut the door behind me and threw myself onto the bed feeling exhausted from the events of the day.

\----

‚ÄúAre you ready for this?‚Äù Mireya asked taking a sip of her coffee as she watched me grab my coat.

‚ÄúYeah, Danielle has been blowing up my phone, the witch might just fire me if I stay away any longer,‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúBesides I‚Äôm moving on with my life, and that includes treating Peter like he doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

She gave me a small, approving nod. ‚ÄúGood. Make him regret it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I will.‚Äù I smirked and winked at her before grabbing my bag and heading out of the apartment.

As the harsh cold weather hit me once I stepped out of the building, reality followed too, since the failed wedding I‚Äôd locked myself away in Mireya‚Äôs apartment avoiding everybody from my father to Peter and Kingsley. I needed space and time to process how greatly my rush actions were going to impact my life, but that time was cut short with my boss constantly calling and threatening to fire me if I didn‚Äôt show up.

‚ÄúThank you Teddy,‚Äù I smiled at the doorman who pulled open the door for me once I‚Äôd reached the office building, but the second I stepped into the lobby, my feet came to a screeching halt as my eyes landed on him and my lungs were filled with a beautiful leather mixed with oud and mint scent.

Hey everyone,
I‚Äôm a 21 year old guy currently living in Helsinki. I‚Äôve been in Finland for over a year now, but to be honest, I haven‚Äôt made any  friends yet and I‚Äôm really hoping to change that.

I‚Äôm mainly looking for people around my age (older or younger) who are down to make new friends. Someone to hang out with, chill, explore the city, talk about life, grab a coffee, or just do normal, everyday stuff. I‚Äôve realized how much I miss having people around to connect with, laugh with, or just spend time with casually.

Also, just putting it out there I used to play football back when I lived in Rihiim√§ki, and I really miss it. So if someone is into playing football sometimes, that would be a nice bonus. I would love to join where I can play sometimes with people around my age.

I also have lots of hobbies like playing football, gyming, gaming, travelling, learning some musical instrument but I never get time for this. Weekdays are gone in office, while on weekends I have to wash my clothes, do home chores, buy groceries etc. 0 second for hobbies. While these women somehow have 50hrs to do 10 activities without getting tired. 

On the top they write 10 different hobbies but their ""Typical Sunday"" involves sleeping, coffee and series watching. Hypocrisy much? 

And moreover they have the audacity to call me boring just because I have no hobbies when they themselves don't have any hobbies? Of course I have hobbies but don't have the time. Give me 50hrs a day and I'll do them too. It's no surprise that nobody wants to live without hobbies. 

It's not humanly possible to have 10 different hobbies. A girl in my school won the ""Best All Rounder"" prize and she was good only in dance and studies. She wasn't expert in singing, drawing, instrument playing, sports etc. Just one hobby and she went deep into it. 

Y'all need to become realistic and accept you don't have any hobbies and just write all these for fun",11,1754134456.0,AskIndia,39,0.6,False

I was just wondering if the unit is +10 / +12 yrs old if replacing the brew unit will result in somewhat better coffee? Has anyone replaced the brew unit and what's been your experience?

Another thing I was thinking of replacing is the grinder unit. Anyone has thoughts on that - appreciated.

To be crystal - both brew and grinder units are working. However, due to unit being +10 yrs or more was thinking of flipping - if and only if it results in better coffee. 

I understand its a gamble. A brew unit is probably $200+, grinder: $400+. However, the unit I have is currently $2500+. I also understand pump, etc. can give away and probably the money I spend in replacing will be a waste. However, I am okay to take the gamble. 

Finally - if there's any other relatively easily replaceable part which results in better coffee taste - happy to explore?

Luna Campbell was just about to fall asleep when she suddenly heard a knock at the door. She opened it and saw Zachary Byrne standing right in front of her.

She couldn't read Zachary's expression, but it was definitely different from usual. There was something harsh in it, something intense that didn't belong to him.

Luna instinctively tried to shut the door, but Zachary reached out and stopped her. He came in, locked the door behind him‚Äîevery move smooth and fast.

Zachary stared at Luna, who was clearly startled, his presence growing heavier by the second.

Luna kept backing up under the pressure he gave off, until she hit the corner of the wall with nowhere left to go. Her body stiffened as she forced herself to call out to him, ""Zachary, what are you doing?""

Zachary looked at her, his eyes stormy. ""You still owe me an explanation."" He wanted to hear it straight from her.

He was standing too close. Luna felt like the air around her had thinned. It was hard to breathe. Soon, she couldn't even look him in the eye anymore. Embarrassed, she turned her head away and blurted out, ""Explain what?""

Zachary grabbed Luna's chin and turned her face back toward him. His voice carried a dangerous edge. ""Explain whether you've been toying with me.""

His hand locked her face in place. When Luna didn't answer, Zachary leaned in, his voice low and forceful. ""Say it, Luna. Have you been toying with me?""

Luna couldn't break free from his grip. All of a sudden, a surge of anger rose in her. ""Yeah, I've been toying with you."" When she admitted it, her tone was hard. After speaking, she waited for him to explode.

Zachary's eyes were bloodshot, his whole body trembling slightly. The emotion running through him was almost too much to contain.

His gaze traced the shape of her face, then stopped at her slightly parted lips. His Adam's apple bobbed with a dry swallow, and his voice came out hoarse and raw. ""Then keep going.""

Luna froze, her eyes widening in shock, and her voice faltered. ""What did you just say?""

""Keep toying with me."" Zachary pulled her into his arms, burying his face in the curve of her neck, inhaling her scent deeply. ""Keep going.""

Luna's heart pounded so hard she couldn't speak. He was holding her so tightly that she started wondering if she was hearing things.

But then, Luna felt the dampness at the side of her neck. It carried a broken, desperate heat. Right after that, she heard Zachary's voice, cracked and raspy. ""Wanna do it now?"" he asked.

It was clearly Zachary who had barged in like he owned the place, yet now he looked like he was the one who'd been hurt by her.

Luna didn't know what to do. After a long silence, she slowly reached out and gently pushed him away.

The warm light cast a soft glow. Luna saw the redness in his eyes and suddenly felt drained. She tried to reason with him, saying, ""You shouldn't be like this.""

Zachary brushed his thumb across her lips, then pressed down hard, his voice hoarse as he questioned, ""Then what should I be like?""

Luna had no answer. Her voice was tight. ""I'm going to marry Theodore Hudson."" She looked him in the eye. ""You know there's never going to be anything between us.""

Her phone suddenly buzzed on the bed. She tried to push past Zachary to answer it, but he grabbed her and held her there, his eyes locked on hers. ""I don't care.""

Zachary's tall frame loomed over Luna. She was trapped in the corner, the scent of cedar from his body wrapping around her nose.

At his words, Luna's mind went blank for a moment. Her ears buzzed. After a long pause, she finally forced out a few slow words. ""What did you just say?""

Zachary leaned down slightly, locking eyes with her. His voice was low and steady. ""I said I don't care. And I'm not going to get in the way of you and Theodore.""

His eyes were too focused. Luna's breath started to quicken. The space between them was too small‚Äîshe could hear Zachary's heartbeat clearly.

In the quiet room, his heartbeat thudded against her nerves, throwing her completely off balance.

Zachary reached out and cupped her face. His fingertips brushed over her skin. His eyes were rimmed red. His body trembled slightly as he leaned in and whispered into her ear, his voice deep and intoxicating, ""I'll be careful. He won't find out.""

# Chapter 2 The Encounter

Six months ago, Theodore brought his fianc√©e Luna to one of his usual gatherings with his buddies for the first time. They had just stepped into the private room when the door opened again.

Sophia Watson walked straight up to Theodore, and the room instantly fell silent. Even the deafening music was cut off by someone with a bit of awareness.

Everyone in the room held their breath and turned to look at Sophia. Those who knew Theodore well understood‚Äîshe was the one he had wanted but could never have. She was untouchable.

Especially after she went abroad, her name became a trigger for him. If anyone dared to bring her up, Theodore would flip out in a heartbeat.

Now, Sophia had suddenly come back from overseas without a word and showed up here out of the blue, at the very gathering where Theodore was officially introducing his fianc√©e to the group.

The people sitting or standing in the room wore all kinds of expressions. Their eyes shifted back and forth between Theodore and Sophia before finally settling on Luna, who sat quietly beside Theodore.

Luna sat where the light and shadows met. She was beautiful and delicate, with bright, watery eyes that looked pure and full of life. When she smiled, there were dimples on her cheeks.

She was the daughter of an old friend of Theodore's father. Over ten years ago, a car accident had taken her parents' lives. Since then, she had been passed around among relatives.

Half a year ago, Theodore's father finally found her. After learning how much hardship his best friend's daughter had endured over the years, he was overwhelmed with guilt and directly ordered his son to get engaged to her.

Sophia had gone abroad after graduating from high school and hadn't been heard from in years. Theodore had long given up hope.

When he heard his father's order, he glanced at Luna, who was quietly standing next to him. After a moment of hesitation, Theodore nodded.

In that moment, Theodore thought he saw an entire starry sky reflected in Luna's eyes.

Now, in the dim private room, Sophia stood in front of Theodore, the light behind her casting her face in shadow. She lowered her head, looked at him, and softly called his name, ""Theodore.""

But Theodore didn't respond right away. His first instinct was to turn and look at Luna. Luna knew who Sophia was. She had once seen her photo in Theodore's study.

Sophia didn't get the response she was waiting for, so she followed Theodore's gaze and looked toward Luna. The two girls' eyes met.

The moment she saw Luna, Sophia froze for a second. Sophia already knew Theodore had a fianc√©e, and she had heard from mutual friends that his father had forced Theodore to get engaged to Luna.

So after a brief wave of disappointment, Sophia had managed to pull herself together. But now, looking at Luna in person, Sophia suddenly wasn't so sure anymore.

Sophia thought, 'Maybe Theodore agreed to the engagement not just because his father told him to.'

While Sophia was lost in thought, Andre Marsh, who was sitting next to Theodore, suddenly cleared his throat, breaking the tense silence. He chuckled, ""Sophia, when did you get back? Come sit here.""

As he spoke, Andre scooted to the side, leaving a space for Sophia.

The second Andre spoke, everyone else in the room seemed to snap out of it. People started greeting Sophia one after another, and the atmosphere quickly came back to life.

Sophia immediately snapped back to herself and smiled at Andre as she sat down casually in the spot he'd just vacated. Her voice was still soft and warm. ""I just got back. I didn't tell you guys ahead of time‚ÄîI wanted to surprise you.""

The words were addressed to Andre, but her eyes were on Theodore. It was obvious who the surprise was really for.

Now, Luna was seated on Theodore's left, and Sophia had just taken the seat on his right. The moment Sophia sat down, Luna noticed it‚ÄîTheodore's body tensed all of a sudden, even his breathing turned heavier.

Theodore didn't look at Sophia. Instead, as if something had suddenly irritated him, he leaned forward, grabbed a glass of liquor from the table, and downed it in one go.

But the fact that he never once looked at Sophia only made him seem more off.

Luna's gaze fell on Theodore's hand gripping the glass. After a while, she reached over and tugged on his sleeve. When he looked at her, she gave him a small smile and said slowly, ""Aren't you going to introduce us?""

The room, which had just gotten lively again, suddenly turned quiet. Luna hadn't spoken loudly, but almost everyone heard her.

Theodore frowned ever so slightly. He set his glass back down on the table, then naturally pulled Luna into his arms. His voice was quiet. ""Sophia Watson. We went to high school together.""

Right after he spoke, his gaze darkened as he looked straight at Sophia and remarked, word by word, ""Luna Campbell. My fianc√©e.""

Under that look, Sophia instinctively straightened up a little. She turned her head and looked directly at Luna, offering a polite smile. ""It's nice to meet you.""

Luna seemed like she didn't sense the awkwardness in the air. She smiled back at Sophia, the dimples on her cheeks faintly showing. She spoke a little shyly, ""Nice to meet you too.""

She paused, then couldn't help but add with sparkling eyes, ""Sophia, you're so pretty."" Luna looked incredibly sweet.

Everyone in the room saw it, and the atmosphere turned even stranger. Sophia looked at Luna, her expression hard to read for a moment. Sophia didn't respond right away.

Steven Cooper, who was sitting next to Andre, couldn't hold back. He glanced at Luna and spoke mockingly, ""Sophia was our prom queen back in high school. If she weren't pretty, why would Theodore have had his eye on her all these years?""

Like most people in the room, Steven knew Luna was the fianc√©e that Theodore's father had forced on Theodore, so Steven had his own bias against her.

Plus, Steven knew everything Theodore had done over the years for Sophia and Steven had always sided with her.

That was why, when Sophia returned to the country and asked Steven about Theodore, Steven didn't hesitate to fill her in on everything that had happened over the years. Tonight, Steven even sent her the address to tonight's gathering.

The awkward dynamic among the three of them was laid bare in Steven's words. Andre's expression went grim. He kicked Steven under the table and quickly turned, trying to laugh it off. But before he could say anything, Sophia spoke.

Her eyes swept past Theodore and landed on Luna. Sophia thought for a moment and then smiled, ""We all went to high school together. Steven's always been one to joke around. Don't take it the wrong way.""

Theodore didn't say anything. His expression turned frighteningly cold. When he looked up, his gaze landed on Steven, full of warning.

Luna looked at Sophia and gave a faint smile. After a moment of thought, she answered seriously, ""Even if it's true, it's okay.""

Her tone was so sincere that Theodore could feel it. The irritation in his chest flared up again. He couldn't help but grab her wrist and ask in a low voice, ""Tired? Let's head back.""

Luna glanced at his hand holding her wrist but didn't answer right away. She was distracted, thinking, 'Theodore's hands are so strong and elegant, every line perfectly defined.'

When he didn't hear a response, Theodore picked up his jacket and got to his feet, ready to take Luna away.

Sophia heard what he said and saw him move. Her hands clenched slightly. Before Theodore could say he was leaving, Sophia couldn't help but call out, ""Theodore."" She only said his name, but there was a note of pleading in her voice.

There were so many familiar faces in the room. From the moment Sophia walked in until now, Theodore hadn't said a single word to her, except for that cold introduction. If he left now, it would be a slap in the face for Sophia.

Theodore froze. He turned back to look at her, his expression unreadable.

Andre's gaze moved back and forth among the three of them. He scratched his nose, then signaled someone nearby to turn the music back on to liven up the room.

Then Andre gave Theodore a quick smile, playing it cool. ""Theodore, Zachary said he's coming. Why not wait a bit?""

# Chapter 3 Taking Her Home

Zachary wasn't like the rest of them. Even in their privileged circle of the rich and powerful, his status was still at the top. The only reason they even knew him‚Äîlet alone called him by his first name‚Äîwas because of Theodore.

The Hudson family and the Byrne family were equals in influence and power, but their heirs couldn't be more different in personality. Still, Theodore and Zachary had been close since childhood.

Theodore was clear-cut in what he loved and hated, and loyalty meant everything to him. He had a lot of close friends.

Zachary was steady and composed, always calm and mild-mannered, never in a rush. In all the years they'd known him, no one had ever seen him lose his temper.

Most of the gatherings in this circle couldn't even get Zachary to show up. Only when Theodore was around would he occasionally make an appearance.

Tonight's get-together was actually kind of a big deal‚ÄîTheodore was formally introducing his fianc√©e to everyone. As his good friend, of course Zachary had to come.

The vein on Theodore's forehead twitched. He didn't respond to Andre, just looked down at Luna and asked in a low voice, ""Wanna go home?""

Subtle glances swept over, picking up on the tension between them. Those looks landed on Luna like they carried weight. She looked up at Theodore and smiled, then made her decision. ""Let's wait,"" she replied.

Luna was still being so sweet that Theodore couldn't help softening a little. He tossed the jacket he'd picked up back onto the couch and sat down again.

Andre immediately tried to liven things up. He kicked Steven lightly and jerked his chin, signaling him. ""Your girl's staring at you, practically begging for your attention. What are you standing here for? Go sing with her,"" Andre said.

Steven rotated through girlfriends every so often. Andre couldn't keep track of their names, so he just called them all ""your girl"".

Everyone in their circle knew what was up‚Äîit was all casual. Nobody cared whether the women were actual girlfriends or just flings. The women didn't care either.

Steven gave Andre a sideways glance, then slowly got up and walked over to pick a song with his new fling wrapped around his arm.

Steven's fling picked up on the vibe in the room and knew something was off. She didn't dare go for anything too upbeat and chose a soft love song instead.

That kind of melody was good for memories and catching up. The lights dimmed, and a wash of blue settled over the room, casting a hazy, dreamlike feel.

Someone asked out of curiosity, ""Sophia, now that you're back, are you leaving again?""

Sophia had already calmed down. When she heard the question, she turned to Theodore, her gaze thoughtful. She spoke slowly, ""I'm not leaving again.""

That was when the door to the private room opened. Zachary walked in with his jacket slung over one arm. He stood six feet two, and just stepping into the room carried a kind of pressure.

The moment they saw Zachary, everyone in the room except Theodore and Luna stood up, greeting him one after another.

Sophia gave Zachary a smile. ""Zachary, it's been a while.""

Zachary, as composed as ever, gave her a slight nod, then looked at Theodore. ""I had another thing earlier. I couldn't step away.""

That counted as an explanation. As soon as he finished speaking, Zachary walked over and naturally sat down in the corner of the couch.

He was wearing a tailored black shirt with two buttons undone at the collar and the sleeves casually rolled up. He leaned back, looking slightly tired. Once he was seated, the dozen or so people in the room finally sat down again.

Zachary had always been polite and composed, but no one ever dared to overstep around him. Still, since he rarely showed up, someone couldn't help saying, ""Zachary, you've been gone a while. Thought you wouldn't make it tonight either.""

Zachary took the coffee handed to him and looked up with a faint smile, his voice low. ""I was in Darnwick recently.""

Steven had already come back from his new girl's side. When he heard that, his eyes widened. He blurted out, a little surprised, ""You mean for that summit?""

Everyone here was lined up to take over their family's business someday. A summit that exclusive would be on the radar of anyone paying attention. But not everyone knew what it was, and someone asked, ""What summit?""

Steven's throat moved. He answered the question slowly, one word at a time, ""Global Business Leaders Summit.""

Everyone in the room felt a shock ripple through them. Zachary looked completely unbothered and nodded at Steven, saying, ""I went with the elders in my family. Just to broaden my view.""

He said it modestly, but the entire vibe in the room shifted in an instant. Whatever undercurrents had been flowing between Theodore and Luna were cut off completely.

As the love song neared its end, all the guys started heading over to Zachary. Theodore cut in, his tone calm but firm, ""Zachary's tired. Can't any of you read the room?""

Then Theodore turned to Luna and said, ""This is my best buddy, Zachary Byrne.""

When Zachary came in earlier, Luna had instinctively started to stand up with everyone else‚Äîafter all, even Sophia had‚Äîbut Theodore had stopped Luna.

Now, hearing Theodore's introduction in her ear, Luna finally looked over at Zachary and gave him a smile. She turned her head slightly as she greeted Zachary, ""Hi, I'm Luna Campbell.""

""I know."" Zachary's tone was as composed as always. He looked at her across the few people between them, paused for a beat, then added, ""You're Theodore's fianc√©e.""

The moment he finished, his gaze shifted away. He turned his head, unbothered, and said in a light tone, ""Why did you guys stop singing?""

The vibe in the room picked right back up. Some went back to singing, others to rolling dice, chatting, or drinking.

Luna sat quietly the whole time, completely out of place in the noisy crowd. Theodore brought over a fruit plate and, while talking to the people next to him, casually started feeding her pieces.

Sophia silently watched Theodore. After a long time, she finally felt like she didn't belong here at all‚Äîbut she didn't want to leave either.

She kept her head down, holding her glass and sipping slowly. After drinking enough to feel a little tipsy, she couldn't help but look over at Zachary.

Normally, Zachary would've left early in this kind of situation. But tonight, he just sat there, showing no sign of leaving. He kept his usual calm and polite demeanor, still responding to friends who came up to chat with him.

Sophia's fingers twitched unconsciously. She remembered that unexpected run-in with Zachary overseas not long ago. At the time, she had just come out of a rough relationship and was feeling pretty low.

Then, out of nowhere, Sophia saw Zachary at a small get-together with some mutual friends. She couldn't help asking him about how everyone was doing‚Äîespecially Theodore.

Zachary had said, ""Theodore's engaged. You should ask him yourself. Sophia, if you can't make up your mind, then don't mess with him again.""

Back then, when Sophia heard that, it felt like her heart had suddenly clenched hard. She was certain Zachary had said that on purpose to let her know Theodore had been waiting for her.

In that moment, it was like something inside her woke up. That was when she made up her mind to come back to the country.

After saying hi to Zachary, Luna hadn't really spoken to anyone else. She quietly let Theodore feed her fruit, occasionally glancing down at her phone. After a while, she leaned toward Theodore and spoke softly, a little apologetic, ""I need to go back to campus.""

Luna was in her junior year. Her schedule wasn't too busy. Since she got engaged to Theodore six months ago, she had mostly been staying at his place and rarely went back to the dorm.

But today was different. Her roommate Aria Baxter had just messaged her to say their other roommate, Nina Woods, had just gotten dumped. Not just dumped‚Äîcheated on.

Nina was drunk now and lost control, threatening to go confront her ex-boyfriend and the other girl. Aria couldn't talk Nina out of it and was asking Luna for backup.

Theodore had been drinking and couldn't drive. He grabbed her with one hand and reached for his phone with the other to call the driver, but the call didn't go through.

Luna pushed his hand away and stood up, looking down at him. ""I'll call a ride.""

Theodore looked at her but didn't say yes. He turned toward the rest of the room, then looked at Zachary. ""Did you drive here? Give us a ride.""

Out of everyone there, only Zachary hadn't had anything to drink. And besides Theodore, no one else would even think of asking Zachary like that.

Zachary got up and grabbed his jacket. He glanced at the two of them through the dim light, his tone still calm. ""Let's go.""

If Theodore left now, the night was basically over. Luna hesitated slightly and looked at him. ""You don't have to come with me. I'll text you when I get there.""

# Chapter 4 The Accident

Luna sat in the passenger seat of Zachary's car. Theodore had stayed behind at the club.

The window was rolled down, letting the night breeze in. It carried a hint of woody fragrance. Zachary had soft music playing.

Luna leaned back in her seat and turned her head to look outside. She seemed lost in thought. Zachary glanced at her, then quietly looked away.

They had been driving for over ten minutes when Zachary spoke up, ""Why haven't you been answering your phone?"" As he asked, his hand on the steering wheel tightened unconsciously.

Luna snapped out of it. Her lashes lowered slightly, and she didn't look at him. Her voice was quiet. ""I told you already. That night was just an accident.""

It happened when Luna had been living at Theodore's place for three months. Theodore was away on a business trip. Late one night, Zachary showed up at the door, smelling like alcohol.

Luna was already asleep when the doorbell rang. Half-asleep, she stumbled over to open the door. Standing there in a white lace nightgown, she looked up at him‚Äîgentle, sleepy, and irresistibly sweet.

Zachary stood in front of her, looking down. He had always been calm and restrained, but in that moment, his heart suddenly pounded like crazy.

Whatever buzz he had from drinking‚Äîit hit him all at once, flooding straight to his head. After a long pause, he tugged at his collar, stared at her, and spoke hoarsely, ""I'm looking for Theodore.""

Zachary didn't know who Luna was, but he knew she had to be someone important to Theodore.

Still half-asleep, Luna finally processed what Zachary said and replied softly, ""Theodore's not home.""

After speaking, she politely waited for a moment. When she didn't hear anything back, she hesitated, then reached out to close the door. Zachary reflexively raised his hand to stop it.

Luna's eyes flew open. She looked up at him, startled and scared.

Zachary saw the fear on her face. He swallowed hard involuntarily. He quickly realized how out of line that was, the dark glint in his eyes quickly fading as he stiffly pulled his hand back.

The door in front of him shut quickly. Zachary stood staring at the closed door, momentarily forgetting why he'd even come to see Theodore.

But soon enough, Zachary found out who the woman who had answered the door was. And he also found out what she meant to Theodore.

The stirrings of that night, intensified by alcohol, should've faded quickly the moment Zachary learned about the relationship between Theodore and Luna. But everything spun out of control. Zachary couldn't stop thinking about Luna‚Äîbetween meetings, on business trips.

Even in the middle of the night, as he slept, Zachary dreamed of Luna standing in the doorway in that white lace nightgown.

This time, she didn't close the door. She let him in. Then he picked her up and carried her into the bedroom, dropping her onto the bed.

When Zachary woke up, his body was drenched in sweat. He could hear the pounding of his own heartbeat and feel the mortifying reaction in his body.

Zachary even started paying attention to Luna without realizing it. He found out her name, her background. Finding her social media accounts was easy. She didn't post often, maybe once every ten days or so.

After finishing his work, Zachary scrolled all the way back to Luna's earliest posts from a few years ago and read through them one by one. Whenever she rarely posted a selfie, he couldn't help saving it.

More than a month after he first saw Luna, there was only one thought in Zachary's mind‚Äîhe wanted to get closer to her. So he agreed to her university's invitation to give a public lecture.

When Zachary's secretary communicated with the university, he even subtly hinted at something to the administration.

Seats in the lecture hall were limited and distributed through a competitive course registration system. Luna hadn't planned to go‚Äîshe had only heard Aria mention it once and didn't think much of it.

But then the academic advisor called Luna into the office and told her she would be attending the lecture as a representative of the College of Arts and Sciences and would be asking Zachary a question.

Luna sat in the front row. Her skin looked soft and smooth under the floral dress. Her shiny hair fell gently over her shoulders, with a few loose strands brushing her cheeks. She tilted her beautiful face slightly upward, looking right at Zachary.

When she asked her question, Zachary was staring at her slightly parted lips, but all he could hear was the sound of his own heartbeat, growing louder in his chest.

When Zachary showed up in front of Luna, there was a brief moment where he was trying to prove to himself that this girl he'd only met once hadn't actually left much of a mark on him.

But he was wrong. The effect Luna had on Zachary hadn't gone away‚Äîit had only gotten stronger. And at the same time, the sense of inner conflict was tearing him apart.

About five or six days after the lecture, Luna posted on her social media with the caption, ""Tipsy"", along with a picture of a blue-colored fruit cocktail. For once, she had even tagged the location.

Zachary stared at the photo for a few seconds, then suddenly stood up, grabbed his jacket, and left the office.

He didn't even bring his driver. He drove himself straight to the bar tagged in Luna's post. Around eleven, tired and worn out in the driver's seat, Zachary saw her come out with a few classmates.

Luna looked a little drunk, walking slowly. The group was about ten people or so. Zachary couldn't hear what they were saying. But eventually one of the male classmates flagged down a cab and helped her into it, wanting to get her home.

Zachary's eyes locked onto the guy's hand holding her arm. A wave of irritation surged in Zachary's chest, hard to explain and even harder to suppress.

Feeling suffocated, Zachary unbuttoned two buttons at his collar. He had just wanted to see Luna. But now, expressionless, he tailed the cab all the way to Theodore's house on Oakwood Street.

After she got out of the car, the cab drove off. Zachary's car stayed parked outside Theodore's place for over twenty minutes.

Zachary leaned back in the driver's seat, staring at nothing, his jaw tight. Theodore had gone abroad for a conference. Luna, drunk, was home alone.

Over an hour later, Zachary punched in the passcode and entered Theodore's house. Theodore, as Zachary's best friend, had never kept him out. He even told Zachary the usual password.

Zachary usually rang the bell out of courtesy, but not tonight. Tonight, his reasons weren't exactly pure. He didn't need the pretense.

No lights were on inside. Moonlight spilled in through the windows. Zachary moved through it like a beast lurking in the dark.

In the bedroom, Luna was already asleep. The faint scent of alcohol lingered in the air.

Zachary stood at the doorway, staring at the petite figure curled up in bed. His throat suddenly felt dry. It wasn't until he heard a soft little whimper from the bed that he realized his heartbeat had lost control again.

In the next moment, he exhaled sharply, closed the door behind him, and walked toward Luna in the total darkness.

The alcohol dulled Luna's senses. Half-asleep in bed, she thought it was Theodore. When she smelled the woody scent on Zachary, she couldn't help leaning in, mumbling and clinging to him.

Zachary was completely tense. Just as she started pulling away in frustration from the lack of response, he pulled her back into his arms in the dark.

Luna didn't sleep soundly. Her arms were pinned tightly at her sides. Zachary's heavy breathing filled her ears, and her body was hit with waves of tingling, overwhelming pleasure.

All night, Luna drifted in and out of sleep. Near dawn, she woke up thirsty. Half-conscious, she felt weak all over. She didn't want to move.

When Luna realized she was being held tightly in a warm embrace, she mumbled in a soft, sweet voice, ""I want some water.""

Her voice still carried the drowsiness and sultriness of just waking up. Zachary, holding her, froze for a second when he heard it. But soon, he got up and went to get her some water.

As the bedroom door opened, dim light came in. Luna was given a few sips of water and slowly began to sober up. She sensed something was wrong and looked up at Zachary.

Zachary felt her trembling in his arms. His jaw tensed and then he set the glass on the nightstand. When Luna shrank back warily, he grabbed her and stared straight into her eyes, his voice unsettlingly cold. ""You were drunk last night,"" he said.

The light was faint. Luna was pinned against the headboard, so scared and nervous that her teeth were chattering.

Zachary hadn't slept all night, but he felt unusually wired. He should have left before Luna woke up, but he didn't want to.

Once Luna calmed down a little, Zachary reached out and turned on the nightlight.

He thought Luna would cry, lash out, or demand an explanation. But she didn't. After the first wave of panic and fear passed, she sat up against the headboard, holding the blanket around her. She looked up at him and softly called his name, ""Zachary.""

She knew who he was. She knew Zachary was Theodore's close friend. Theodore had mentioned him more than once. She felt a moment of confusion, but she didn't want to dig into how this all happened.

Luna had always been that way since she was little‚Äîbelieving that once something happened, it couldn't be undone. If there was a problem, it needed to be solved. Crying or throwing a fit wouldn't fix anything.

And right now, Luna had only one thought‚ÄîTheodore couldn't find out about this. If he did, they were done.

""It was just an accident."" She looked at Zachary, her fingers slowly tightening around the blanket as her voice came out slowly. ""Zachary, please leave.""

# Chapter 5 The Storm

After that night, Zachary had to leave the country due to a trip that had already been arranged. Still, he tried calling Luna a few times while he was away. Unsurprisingly, she didn't answer any of his calls.

Now, Zachary glanced over at Luna in the passenger seat. His throat tightened as he asked again, his voice hoarse, ""Luna, why haven't you answered my calls?""

Even if Luna had blocked his number, he could've used a new one. So she simply stopped answering altogether or hung up directly.

When Luna noticed the car had changed course, a flash of impatience crossed her face. She finally got serious, replying in a clear and direct tone, ""I don't think it's necessary. Is that a good enough reason?""

Zachary's eyes darkened. He didn't say anything. But the car suddenly picked up speed.

Luna frowned, thinking he was acting crazy. After a long pause, she spoke again, ""Take me back to the campus. If you won't, I'll ask Theodore to come get me.""

Zachary's grip on the steering wheel slowly tightened. At the next intersection, the car turned around.

The black Bentley stopped in front of the school gate. Luna got out of the car without even glancing back at Zachary, her eyes down on her phone.

Aria had already calmed Nina down and didn't need backup anymore. Aria was exhausted from the night and needed coffee to survive.

A small, gentle smile appeared on Luna's face as she replied: \[Got it.\] She didn't go into the school right away. She turned and walked into the nearby coffee shop to order three drinks‚Äîa caramel macchiato, a vanilla latte, and a hazelnut cappuccino.

The Bentley parked beside the school stood out like crazy. Luna came out of the coffee shop and didn't look in Zachary's direction at all. She walked straight toward campus.

Zachary saw the smile on Luna's face. Just like at the club earlier tonight, she looked perfectly sweet. His car stayed there for a long time.

\*\*\*\*\*

Theodore had brought Luna into his circle. From then on, whenever he met up with his close friends, he usually brought her along.

At those occasional gatherings, Luna would sometimes run into Zachary, but he was always cold toward her. Over time, the tension in her body started to ease.

On the first day of summer break, Luna had dinner with her classmates and went straight back to the dorm afterward. When she woke up the next morning, the dorm was already empty. Everyone had left to catch their trains and buses home.

Luna curled up under her blanket, staring at the sunlight peeking through the gap in the curtains, her mind blank for a moment. She had no home to go back to and didn't want to go to Theodore's place either.

When Luna was younger, the thing she feared most was summer and winter break. The long holidays meant she had to stay with whichever relative would take her in. And no matter where she stayed, she was never truly welcomed.

They didn't hit her or yell at her, but the feeling of living under someone else's roof kept her walking on eggshells.

The Hudson family was the only lifeline Luna had been able to grab in the past ten years. She had never known the kind of love that felt secure, nor had she developed an unshakable character.

She had grown up trying hard to survive, long since letting go of any naive dreams.

\*\*\*\*\*

Theodore called around nine in the morning. Luna let it ring for a while before slowly picking up.

""You're up?"" His voice had a cheerful tone.

""Yeah."" Luna sounded a little groggy.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm all for supporting local caf√©s, and I‚Äôve tried a bunch‚Äîfrom roadside espresso stalls to those vibey, minimalist third-wave spots with P200+ price tags for a ‚Äúcoffee experience.‚Äù Pero minsan, parang mas social experiment na kaysa sa talagang masarap yung kape??

Random observations:

Some cafes are ALL aesthetic, ZERO taste. Good lighting, mid brews.

Yung barista na parang mas galit pa sayo kung hindi mo alam ano yung V60 or if you ask for ‚Äú3-in-1 taste.‚Äù

Some people go to caf√©s not for coffee... but for OOTDs and reels.

The gatekeeping is real. May subtle shame if you still enjoy Starbucks or dare to say ‚ÄúNescaf√© is life.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the best coffee I‚Äôve had here? Galing sa lola ko. Brewed over a gas stove, strong, black, no drama.

So what gives? Are we really developing a meaningful coffee culture here in Gensan‚Äîor are we just chasing the same Manila trends and slapping them with ""local"" tags?

I wanna hear from y‚Äôall‚Äîespecially local baristas, caf√© owners, or even fellow caffeine addicts.

I work in a fast paced B2B sales industry in the UK. We are large company and currently struggling to get our orders to customers due to poor operational management/changes 
I lead a sales team who is one of the very few successful teams In the company this year.
Sadly most of my time and my team's time is focused on trying to repair relationships with our clients.

I have been offered training for four days, focusing on motivation and leadership etc etc. 
I will add my team is a long servicing experienced team and I pride myself in these areas as I get great feedback from them as a team on how I manage them.
I am not claiming to be the best or complete in these areas, but I don't feel like focusing on these areas are a priority for us this stage, especially when 80% of time is dealing with service issues and not selling/prospecting
This training is all very laid back meeting up for coffee and mentoring/shadowing me, photos on linkedin (cringe) etc as colleagues have been on it.
I'd be keen to hear how managing directors or senior leaders would feel if a sales team leader who was currently performing refused training of this sort and just wanted to currently focus on the job and bringing the numbers in.
Im not saying I wouldn't get anything out of it but the priority for me is getting all the sales people to perform and help them get to their numbers before year end. 
Could this be viewed negatively and effect my future opportunities for progression?
 How do I kick the can down the road without looking disruptive? 
Any advice or perspectives would be valued.

Even before I am fully awake, I know that this is going to be a day from hell and I have had enough of those in my life.

If just one more thing in my life goes wrong, I am out of here and I will never set foot in this territory again.

‚ÄúDid the bond form?‚Äù I ask Charna, my Lycan. If it did, it would make my day better, or at least I hope so.

‚ÄúIt did form.‚Äù She replies, but her tone tells me something is wrong.

I turned eighteen a week ago and found a connection with the future Alpha, Nico, one of the people on my list for hurting me over and over again.

No, he never hit me and neither did anyone else.

Okay, maybe I need to explain something for you to understand what I am talking about.

On my sixth birthday I had been at the lake with my Father, who is our Pack‚Äôs Beta, and the Alpha and Gamma family. I had gotten bored with the games they were playing, and I had wandered off into the forest; most of our territory is forest.

I knew to keep an eye out for the markings that tell us where our borders are and I had been picking wild flowers as I walked around. A soft whimper had gotten my attention and being the curious little Beta, I had gone looking for the source.

If only I had known that I would come to hate my sixth birthday one day, I might have walked in the opposite direction.

I had found a girl in the forest. Later, it turned out that she was just a little older than me, and I had taken her to our Alpha.

Her name was Lucy, but she couldn‚Äôt tell us how she had gotten here or where she had come from. She did know that her birthday had just been a few days ago or would be in a few days, and that had been the first time that she had gotten something that was mine.

‚ÄúYou have so many dolls, why don‚Äôt you give one to Lucy?‚Äù my Father had asked and as I had thought about which doll to gift her, I had nodded my head.

My Father had grabbed my favorite doll from the picnic blanket and as I had objected to it, my Father had already given it to Lucy.

I had tried to explain to my Father that I didn‚Äôt want to part with that specific doll, but he had just said that I was being selfish, and he had placed Lucy next to him on the blanket.

Lucy had lived on the first floor with the Omegas for about a week, when my Father had moved Lucy to our floor. He had said that Lucy didn‚Äôt like living with the Omegas, and she had asked my Father if she could come live with us.

I doubt nowadays that she used the word ‚Äúus‚Äù back then, but I wasn‚Äôt there when she had asked and therefore I can‚Äôt be sure.

Every birthday I had was overshadowed by Lucy, my Father always telling me that she didn‚Äôt have parents to throw her a party and I could just share my party with Lucy.

This happened again and again, not only due to my Father but also due to the Alpha and Gamma families. Nico was the worst, and he would always remind me that Lucy was much prettier than me, at least in his eyes.

So, now you might understand why Nico is on my shit list.

I train every single day because I have to because I am the future Beta. Well, I was the future Beta, and now I am going to be the future Luna.

Nico had been as surprised as I was, but he wanted to form a bond with me. After all, the Goddess had made the connection, and we needed to respect her decision.

Lucy hadn‚Äôt been too happy with it; she had been trying to get Nico‚Äôs attention for almost a year now and had failed miserably. She even went out of her way to make sure I knew that she would never accept me as a Luna and I had just laughed in her face.

Being Nico‚Äôs Mate will make me the Luna, and Lucy cannot do anything about it, even though she might try.

I have gone through my morning routine and am rinsing the dishes I used for breakfast. I hardly ever eat breakfast in the main dining room, because I usually train during that time.

I see that the door to the master bedroom is wide open, which means that my Father is already downstairs, probably having an early morning meeting with the rest of our leadership.

‚ÄúWhy are you so quiet?‚Äù I ask Charna, this should be a joyous day for both of us.

She doesn‚Äôt answer me, but the moment I leave the Beta floor, she starts pacing in my head and forces me to head up to the Alpha floor. I enter the floor using the code I was given after I turned sixteen, and I am met with complete silence.

It seems I was right about the early morning meeting, and Nico is using it to sleep in, just like he does every time his parents are preoccupied or absent.

I hadn‚Äôt made any plans with Nico, even though we knew that today would probably be the day that our Mate-bond would be completed. Charna doesn‚Äôt understand why we didn‚Äôt make any plans, and to tell you the truth, neither do I.

My steps falter as I stand in front of Nico‚Äôs bedroom door and I am glad that our bond hadn‚Äôt formed earlier. If it had and we had accepted one another as Mates, I would be in excruciating pain right now.

Because the Asshole is fucking another female, the sounds coming from his room don‚Äôt leave any room for errors and I am not sure what to do right now.

‚ÄúIs this why he didn‚Äôt want to tell anyone just yet?‚Äù Charna asks me and I think we both know that that is exactly the reason.

‚ÄúOhh, Lucy. That feels so good.‚Äù I hear Nico groan, but it is the name he called that has made me furious and I can barely manage to keep myself from bursting in. I need to find a way to expose those two, and slowly, I make my way out of the Alpha floor and back to my own room without shedding a tear.

I am going to make them pay for what they did and everyone will know about our connection, but it ends today.

# New Life

I walk into my bedroom and grab my suitcases from the back of my closet; I place them on my bed to start packing the remainder of my belongings. There are only a few sets of clothes left in my closet and only the daily necessities in the bathroom.

Most of the things I want to take with me are already in my suitcases. I made the decision to leave Shadow Valley Pack at my Sweet Sixteen party, and I already know where I am going.

I will be going to the Elders to learn everything I need to learn to become the best Beta I can be, and I will find a Pack that will appreciate me for who I am.

My weapons are in the trunk of my car; I take them out every time I need them and place them back after I have cleaned them. All that is left is my luggage, and then I will make sure that everyone understands who is responsible for me leaving.

Okay, let‚Äôs get introductions out of the way. My name is Dallas, I am eighteen years old and my Lycan, Charna, showed up a year ago. My life hasn‚Äôt been a bed of roses and the only reason I stayed this long is the hope of finding my Mate.

Well, we already know that that didn‚Äôt go as planned. I am officially done with the people in my life and the leadership of this Pack.

I walk back up to the Alpha floor, and to my surprise, Nico and Lucy are still at it, but I no longer give a damn.

‚ÄúNico, harder.‚Äù I hear Lucy moan. ‚ÄúPut a Pup in me, I want you to cum inside me.‚Äù I can hear Nico groan before he yells that he is coming.

I slam open the door, and Lucy drops to the floor when Nico pushes her off his cock, startled by my presence. Both make a mess of themselves and the bedroom.

I don‚Äôt wait for him to respond; I just turn on my heel and walk down the hallway to the door.

‚ÄúPlease, Dallas. Stop. This is not what it looks like; it just happened.‚Äù Nico says, hopping on one leg as he tries to pull on some sweatpants.

I don‚Äôt say anything; I just keep walking down the stairs, and I know that Nico and Lucy are right behind me.

Everyone in the main dining room goes quiet the moment they see me walking in, and I can hear a few whispers the moment Nico and Lucy walk in behind me; everyone can smell the scent of sex in the air.

‚ÄúI, Dallas, reject you, Nico, as my Mate.‚Äù I say after I have turned around to look at him.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if you accept it or not. Just know that it won‚Äôt stop me from finding my own happiness and you will have to suffer the consequences of not accepting my rejection.‚Äù I state.

‚ÄúDallas, why are you rejecting our Son?‚Äù Alpha Leon asks and I turn around to look at him.

‚ÄúBecause, as usual, Lucy wanted what is mine and got it. Your Son fucked Lucy, even though he knew that our Mate-bond was nearly complete and now I know why he didn‚Äôt want us to tell anyone.‚Äù I say as I look into Alpha Leon‚Äôs eyes.

I turn back to Lucy and Nico, he is still staring at me and his hands are pressed against his chest. I don‚Äôt feel any pain, but that might change if he accepts my rejection.

‚ÄúYou wanted him; you can have him. You can have everything that was once mine. I hope that the two of you become very happy together, and I hope that you enjoy your victory.‚Äù I say to Lucy before I walk past her and out of the main dining room.

‚ÄúStop, you can‚Äôt leave. You are my Mate.‚Äù Nico says and I turn around to see him standing in the doorway.

‚ÄúI am no longer your Mate. You chose to sleep with her, and now you can deal with the consequences. You have always put Lucy before me, just like your family, the Gamma family and even my own Father. You never failed to remind me that you thought that Lucy was prettier than I am.

Our Mate-bond would have made you see that you had been wrong, that you had hurt me with your words, and I would have forgiven you because of our Mate-bond. What I can‚Äôt forgive and what I will never forgive, is that you chose to fuck another woman.‚Äù I say in a calm, cold voice.

The entire dining room is quiet and everyone is waiting for what is coming next.

‚ÄúDallas, there might be a very good explanation‚Ä¶‚Äù But I don‚Äôt give Alpha Leon the chance to finish his sentence.

‚ÄúWhat kind of explanation can your Son have for being buried balls deep in Lucy? Where in this damn universe could this have been an accident?‚Äù I growl in his direction.

More Pack-members have gathered in the dining room, all of them curious about the drama unfolding in front of them.

My Father finally gets up from his chair and I am damn curious about what he will have to say.

‚ÄúDallas, you are the future Beta. You already have status within Shadow Valley Pack; why not grant Lucy the status of Luna?‚Äù My Father says.

Charna is growling in my head, but she keeps to the back of my mind. Neither one of us wants him to know that we already shifted or that we know that he lied about our Mother.

‚ÄúHAVE YOU LOST YOUR FUCKING MIND? YOU WANT ME TO GIVE LUCY MY MATE, JUST LIKE YOU GAVE HER THE LAST GIFT MOM GAVE ME OR THE FAMILY HEIRLOOM YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME ON MY SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY.

GET A FUCKING GRIP ON THAT DAMN BRAIN OF YOURS, I HATE YOUR FUCKING GUTS.‚Äù I yell at my Father and I take advantage of his shocked state.

‚ÄúNico, this is your last chance to accept my rejection. Once I walk out the door, you might never get the chance again.‚Äù I state, looking at Nico and it seems to sink in that no one can change my mind.

‚ÄúI, Nico, accept your rejection.‚Äù Nico says, knowing that I will never forgive him.

I walk out of the Pack-house without looking back; I get into my SUV to finally get out of this place and start my new life.

# At Fault

Dallas‚Äô p.o.v.

Six months later

I took my time to travel to Scarlet Crescent Pack. I needed time to myself, and I wanted to take time to write down all the questions I have had for years.

I arrived at my destination after traveling for almost a week.

Charna enjoyed running around in unknown territory and neither one of us feel sorry for ourselves.

It is almost as if there never was a bond between me and Nico, no pain after he accepted our rejection and no sense of loss for us.

I arrived at Scarlet Crescent Pack in the early morning, and I am glad that I had the letter from the Elders printed; it saved a lot of trouble at the gate.

A Squad Captain was waiting for me at the main building, the building that houses the Elders and where I will get my education.

I was given a schedule for the first week and then he showed me the territory we were staying in.

We might live within Scarlet Crescent territory, but we can‚Äôt enter the territory that surrounds the Palace. At least not with permission from the Elders or at the request of the King.

I had the rest of the day off, and I used it to get settled in; my room is on the top floor of building A. It is a hell of a lot bigger than my room back home and I even have a small balcony.

I placed my laptop on the desk next to the balcony door, I unpacked my suitcases and then I went looking for some breakfast.

My first real day with the Elders consisted of tests to establish the level of my knowledge of Laws and my skill level in fighting.

I aced every test they gave me, and that left the Elders with a challenge: where do you place someone who hardly needs basic training?

After consulting with the Squad Captains, I was assigned to one of the Squads and a costume made study plan was devised.

My studies were more focused on Pack-laws and the consequences they could have for a Pack. It was something I wasn‚Äôt taught in Shadow Valley Pack; I didn‚Äôt even know that an Alpha could make his own Laws within his territory.

Those Laws can‚Äôt be breaking our main Laws; they are usually a stricter version of our main Laws, and I was going to need to learn all of them.

I found a few surprises along the way, and I actually enjoyed my studies; they were very educational.

Today, I will become a fully pledged member of Captain Jordan‚Äôs Squad, and I will be allowed to go on missions with the Squad; my main priority is to make sure we know the Pack-laws of the territories we get sent to.

‚ÄúGood morning, Dallas.‚Äù Captain Jordan says as I walk into the living room of our Squad house.

The other Squad members greet me with a smile or a wave and I walk over to the coffee machine to make myself a Latte.

Captain Jordan slides a file in my direction after I have taken a seat not far from him, and I reluctantly open it. I know what is in there and hate it whenever he hands me a file like this.

Captain Jordan was the first one who found out about my past; he had found me cussing and swearing at a phone that was lying on the desk in my room.

It was on my third day as a part of his Squad and I hadn‚Äôt come down yet, so he came looking for me. I had finally turned on the old phone with my sim card in it and I had many text and voice messages from my Father.

None of them were an apology for the way he had treated me. No, each of them was telling me that I was childish, selfish, and immature.

Captain Jordan took the phone from me, and once a month, I get a file on the type of messages I have gotten with the name of whoever left them for me.

My Father still leaves messages telling me I am being childish, selfish and immature. Nico is begging me to come back, to give him another chance and so do his parents. The only one that hasn‚Äôt reached out to me is Lucy and I hope she never does.

My eyes widen when I read a different message from my Father, and I hear Charna laughing in my head; I had completely forgotten about this.

‚ÄúSomething funny, Dallas?‚Äù I hear Captain Jordan ask and I need a minute before I can answer him.

‚ÄúSorry, but it is the last message from my Father.‚Äù I reply and I hear a few growls around me.

‚ÄúI had forgotten that I had changed the password to the program for the Pack funds. I never informed anyone about it, and it slipped my mind that it is the annual fund meeting in a few days.‚Äù I explain, but apparently, I am not making any sense.

‚ÄúEvery Pack makes an annual budget for a variety of Pack-related issues; I have been making them since I turned fifteen, and my Father would pass them off as his own. He never needed access to the program, so he never needed the new password and now the only ones that can get access are Alpha Leon and his Mate.‚Äù I explain.

Captain Jordan has a dumbfounded look on his face and looking around; I can see he isn‚Äôt the only one.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt your Father ask Alpha Leon for the password?‚Äù I hear Elder Jensen ask.

‚ÄúAnd tell Alpha Leon that he hasn‚Äôt done any of the financial tasks he was supposed to do?‚Äù I ask in return.

I hear almost everyone laughing around me, understanding that this would mean losing face for a Beta and no one would want to lose face in front of his Alpha.

‚ÄúBesides, my Father would never admit that he was at fault. No matter the evidence against him.‚Äù I say.

# Our Mother

Daxton‚Äôs p.o.v.

‚ÄúGood morning, Daxton.‚Äù I hear Carl, our future Alpha, say. I doubt it is a good morning if he is standing behind me, he only comes looking for me if someone told him to come and get me.

‚ÄúWho sent you?‚Äù I ask him as I turn to face him. I want to look into his eyes when he answers me; it will tell me if he is aware of why he was sent here.

‚ÄúMy Mother, I believe it has to do with an invitation from Shadow Valley Pack. Between you and me, I think Dad might order you to go.‚Äù Carl answers and I know that he is telling the truth.

I am forty-seven, and I still haven‚Äôt found my true Mate-bond; I never met a woman my Lycan felt a connection with. I have been waiting for twenty-nine years to find that connection, but so far, I haven‚Äôt been able to find her, and I gave up on finding her years ago.

The people around me are still hoping that I will find her one day; they want me to go to other Packs to look for her. I did that for over a decade with no results and now I no longer want to go through it.

‚ÄúI am sorry, Daxton. Mom wants you at the Pack-house for lunch on the Alpha floor.‚Äù Carl says, and I know that he is sorry; our entire future leadership understands me.

None of them have found their true Mate-bond yet and they have to attend as many events as the Pack gets invited to.

I reluctantly follow Carl to the Pack-house; there is no point in shooting the messenger. I am not sure how this lunch will go, but something tells me I will have given everyone a piece of my mind before it ends.

Chatter is coming from the dining room and I can already hear my Mother‚Äôs voice above the others.

‚ÄúIf he doesn‚Äôt find his Mate during that Alpha Ceremony, he will need to take Daniella as his chosen Mate.‚Äù Mom says and even though I am not in the room, I know the smirk Daniella will have on her face.

‚ÄúI will never take Daniella as my chosen Mate. If and that is a big IF I take a chosen Mate, I will decide who becomes my chosen Mate. You don‚Äôt have a say in it, Mother.‚Äù I say calmly, knowing that this annoys the hell out of her.

Not just my tone of voice but also the fact that I use the word Mother instead of Mom.

No one says a word as I sit down across the table from my Mother and Daniella; both of them have an annoyed look on their face. Carl sits down in the seat that was meant for me, next to Daniella.

‚ÄúWhat is this I hear about an invitation, Luna?‚Äù I ask, ensuring everyone understands I know why I was summoned.

‚ÄúShadow Valley Pack will get another Alpha in about seven months; we got invited to attend and to bring along some of our unmated Pack-members.‚Äù Our Luna answers and I know there is no way I am getting away with refusing to go.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know that Nico had found his connection yet and why does Alpha Leon think it is smart to hand over the Pack so soon?‚Äù I ask the question that is probably running through everyone‚Äôs mind.

We had all met Nico over the years and he didn‚Äôt strike me as the most competent for the Alpha position, not to mention the woman who was always with him. If I am not mistaken, her name is Lucy, but we never found out what her rank is or who her parents are.

The last time Nico was here was about four months ago, and we all had felt that something was off that day. We never figured out what was wrong, but the guy had been jumpy throughout the entire visit and he had eyed every woman in the Pack with suspicion until he was able to see their faces.

‚ÄúNone of us knew he had found a connection until the invitation arrived, that is. As to why Alpha Leon is so eager to step down, any guess could be a good one.‚Äù Our Luna answers.

Usually, when a future Alpha finds his connection, his parents make it known to every Pack and not just the allied Packs.

For his parents not to make it known immediately can only mean a few things. He could have gotten someone pregnant who isn‚Äôt his true Mate-bond, he could have taken a chosen Mate for an alliance, or he could have broken the connection to his first Mate for whatever reason.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you accompany Daxton to the Alpha Ceremony, Daniella?‚Äù My Mother asks, but luckily our Luna quickly shoots that idea down.

‚ÄúSorry, but we have chosen the unmated Pack-members already. Daniella is still young and has all the time in the world to find her connection. We will be bringing Pack-members that have been waiting at least five years to find their connection.‚Äù Our Luna responds and I can tell that she is telling the truth.

‚ÄúWe did that on purpose, Daxton.‚Äù She tells me through the mind-link, and for once, I am grateful that our Luna can be conning from time to time.

Unlike most, our Luna isn‚Äôt afraid to talk back to my Mother. My Mother knows that most still consider her this Pack‚Äôs Beta female and that means she gets away with a lot of her behavior, but even my Mother isn‚Äôt stupid enough to go against our Luna.

Our Luna has the final say and no one is going to argue with her about it, not even me.

My Mother and Daniella don‚Äôt seem to be too pleased with our Luna, but my twin Brother, Darius, has a damn smirk on his face and hell breaks loose the moment he opens his mouth.

‚ÄúYou seem eager to have her as a Daughter in law. Why don‚Äôt I take Daniella as my chosen Mate?‚Äù Darius says with a smirk on his face.

Yeah, leave it to my twin Brother to piss off our Mother.

# Missing Something?

Darius‚Äô p.o.v.

The moment the invitation came in, I knew it would mean trouble between my Mother and my twin Brother.

And yes, I say my Mother for a reason. Daxton might be my twin Brother, but she always treated him less than me, and for the first ten years of our lives, we even believed that we were separated by a whole year.

It wasn‚Äôt until our former Alpha overheard a conversation between me and Daxton that we were told that we were twins.

It explained quite a lot of things to both of us, and Daxton has pulled away from our Mother ever since; there even was a time he refused to acknowledge that she was his Mother.

We still don‚Äôt understand why she favors me over Daxton and we both doubt that we will ever find out.

I listen to the words my Mother speaks, but I don‚Äôt respond and I don‚Äôt have to. Daxton can take care of himself, but I am starting to get agitated by Mother‚Äôs relentless quest to get Daxton to take a chosen Mate and preferably Daniella.

None of us likes Daniella; it goes back to our childhood, and she hasn‚Äôt given us a reason yet to change our minds.

Daniella is the Granddaughter of a former Elder and she was always after Preston. No matter what anyone told her, she kept going after him and we thought she might trick him into a chosen Mate-bond.

Daxton, Rayden and I would always be with Preston and we have seen Daniella try a few desperate things to get into Preston‚Äôs bed, but thank the Goddess that she never succeeded. It would have been this Pack‚Äôs downfall and one of us would have been charged with murder.

Mother stares at me when I suggest that I take Daniella as a chosen Mate; I know she doesn‚Äôt think Daniella is good enough to be a Beta‚Äôs Mate, and she will object to my suggestion.

‚ÄúDarius, that is ridiculous. Daniella is not cut out to be a Beta‚Äôs Mate; she would never be able to support you the way you need your Mate to support you.‚Äù Mother replies and I see a devilish look in Rayden‚Äôs eyes.

‚ÄúThen she isn‚Äôt suited to be Daxton‚Äôs Mate either; after all, they are twins, and that makes Daxton also a Beta.‚Äù Rayden states and normally I would say that no one can argue with that, but I know how my Mother feels about Daxton and Beta in the same sentence.

‚ÄúDarius is Silver Eclipse‚Äôs Beta; Daxton holds no title. Daniella can be his chosen Mate, but not that of my little boy.‚Äù My Mother growls and I know Rayden is going to spill the beans.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean with Daxton holds no title? I thought that twins always shared everything, their Mate and their rank.‚Äù Ruth, Rayden‚Äôs Mate, asks.

‚ÄúNice safe, Rayden.‚Äù I hear Preston say over our mind-link.

I would like to hear how my Mother is going to get herself out of this pickle; either she acknowledges that Daxton is also a Beta, or she has to tell a lie.

Daniella has had a disgusted look on her face since Ruth mentioned that twins share a Mate, it seems like she hadn‚Äôt taken that into consideration.

‚ÄúYou are right, Ruth. A twin usually shares a Mate and a rank, but Daxton made a mess of his life at the age of twenty. It is a shameful period and I don‚Äôt like to get reminded of it. I told Preston that Daxton‚Äôs status had been damaged and that only Darius had a right to the Beta of Silver Eclipse Pack.‚Äù My Mother answers Ruth.

Ruth looks at Daxton for a very long time and I know that he is getting uncomfortable by the way she is looking at him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for staring, Daxton. I am just trying to see the monster because only a monster wouldn‚Äôt deserve his rank or a true Mate-bond. I will let you know when I have found that monster, even though I have a feeling that I am looking in the wrong direction.‚Äù Ruth says.

Daxton is trying to hide his laughter, but I am not even trying. Ruth knows what to say and when to say it; she always manages to lighten up a tense situation.

‚ÄúRuth, I don‚Äôt like what you are implying‚Ä¶..‚Äù My Mother starts to say, but Ruth just raises her hand to shut her up.

‚ÄúI am not implying anything. It is just a result of the information that you gave me; the only thing I could come up with is that whatever Daxton did must have painted him as a monster and nothing less. I can‚Äôt see that monster in him and I doubt his Mate will.‚Äù Ruth replies and I see Daxton shaking with laughter.

Our Mother isn‚Äôt used to someone interrupting her or telling her how they feel about her, and Ruth doesn‚Äôt have a problem doing both.

‚ÄúDaxton will never find his connection after all these years; it is time he accepts the fact that he will never have a true Mate-bond.‚Äù My Mother says and I have to grit my teeth to keep quiet.

‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs see if I can get this straight. You believe that Daxton will never find his Mate, but that also means that Darius will never find his Mate. Because Daxton will never find his Mate, you want him to take a chosen Mate and that means that Darius needs to find a chosen Mate too.

They are twins, and that means sharing a Mate; maybe Daniella is willing to take two Mates. Oh, hold on. Her face tells me enough; she is disgusted by the idea of having two Mates. This leaves me with one last question: why settle for the twin that has no right to a high rank according to his Mother?‚Äù Ruth states, her eyes locked with those of my Mother.

Damn, that woman is good. She managed to ask a question that has eluded me all these years.

My Mother is looking a little pale, and Daniella looks as if she is about to throw up; why does that deduction from Ruth unsettle them so much? Have I been missing something all these years?

# Goddess' Gift

Dallas‚Äô p.o.v.

Okay, this is not what I had been expecting. I don‚Äôt believe anyone in our Squad had seen it coming and I am still a little baffled.

Captain Jordan announced his retirement at the ceremony that would make me a fully pledged member of the Squad, but it turned out to go a little differently after his announcement.

Elder Jensen had appointed me as the new Squad Captain and everyone had started cheering for me, but I had been unable to say a word. I have been here a little over six months and now I have my own Squad.

I know there have been a few others who made Squad Captain within a year of arriving, but I am not sure if this is what I want or need in my life at the moment.

I mean, it is an honor that they believe that I can handle this. There is a downside to it, though. I might have to visit Shadow Valley Pack, and I am not sure if I am ready for that at the moment.

‚ÄúCaptain, Elder Jensen wants to see you. He is waiting in your office.‚Äù Joshua, my second in command, says and I wonder why Elder Jensen didn‚Äôt link me. ‚ÄúYou have your block up, Captain.‚Äù

I smile at Joshua as I walk out of my room; I didn‚Äôt just take over as Captain; I also got Jordan‚Äôs room, and that means living on the other side of the top floor. Joshua follows me to my office on the first floor and everyone we pass slightly bows their heads, a sign of respect for my position.

‚ÄúI wish they wouldn‚Äôt do that; it makes me feel uncomfortable. I am still the same person as before, and now the same people who ignored me suddenly show me respect.‚Äù I say to Joshua as another woman slightly bows her head.

‚ÄúIt will become even worse; they will start to talk to you.‚Äù He replies teasingly and Charna is laughing her ass off.

I softly growl at Joshua, and he is smart enough to create a little distance between us. He is one of the few people in our Squad that knows about what other members of other Squads have said to me, each and every one of them implicating that I was Jordan‚Äôs lover.

It wasn‚Äôt until someone said that I had to go and find my own true Mate-bond, that I lost control of my patients and Charna. That fucking Idiot is still in the infirmary and once he has fully recovered, he gets sent home.

No one has dared to make a similar remark to me ever since, but I have gotten enough death glares and I prefer it that way. My Squad members know that I got where I am because of all the hard work I put into it, and none of them question my ability to lead this Squad.

‚ÄúElder Jensen, I apologize for having my block up. I was just finishing up for my last exam and I didn‚Äôt want to get distracted.‚Äù I say as I sit down behind my desk.

‚ÄúNo worries, I knew you were studying. I wanted to do this personally and in private; I know this will be difficult for you, and it might not.‚Äù Elder Jensen says.

Joshua and I are looking at one another, this guy is talking in riddles and I don‚Äôt think I have the patience for it today.

Elder Jensen holds out an envelope for me and after a small hesitation, I take it from his outstretched hand. I recognize the Pack emblem and my first instinct is to throw it back at Elder Jensen, but my curiosity wins.

We are proud to announce the Alpha Ceremony for our Son, Nico, and the Luna Ceremony for his Mate, Lucy.

I don‚Äôt bother reading the rest of the card. I close the card before putting it in the envelope, and I hand it back to Elder Jensen.

‚ÄúWe both know that Nico and Lucy don‚Äôt have a true Mate-bond and that causes an issue for the Elders, but we also want to send out a message to every other Pack in the Kingdom. So, we will wait until the Ceremony, and you will get the honor of telling them that the Alpha Ceremony is canceled.‚Äù Elder Jensen says.

Joshua looks at me for a moment before he seems to understand why I am getting the honor of disrupting an Alpha Ceremony.

‚ÄúHow long do we have?‚Äù I ask Elder Jensen, I need to prepare myself mentally.

‚ÄúYou have over six months to prepare; you know the rules for an Alpha or Luna Ceremony cancellation. Also, make sure that there is a trial date for Alpha Leon, just in case he is willing to fight our decision in front of the King.‚Äù Elder Jensen replies.

‚ÄúOkay, Joshua. Let‚Äôs get this Shitshow on the road; I want the cancellation forms filled out. Alpha Leon will ask for them and he will ask for a trial to overturn their own Pack-law.‚Äù I say as I show Elder Jensen to the door.

I open the door to let Elder Jensen out and I see my third in command, Jesper, waiting outside the door.

‚ÄúGet in here, Jesper. We have more than enough to do and, luckily, a whole lot of time to do it in. I do need some answers, though, and maybe you can help me with that.‚Äù I say as Jesper walks into my office.

Joshua hands him the envelope and I softly growl at the mere sight of the Pack emblem on it.

For a few moments, it is quiet in my office, but then Jesper starts laughing his ass off.

‚ÄúLet me guess, we get to break up the happy shindig?‚Äù He asks and starts laughing even harder. Someone seems to be happy to be a party pooper and I actually have to giggle.

I decide to tell both of them why I get the privilege of dealing with the cancellation and both men growl loudly.

Jesper went through a similar situation and Joshua had his connection broken before there was a chance to form a bond.

Why Nico chose Lucy over me is still unknown; Jesper and Joshua both know why they were turned down. Neither of them had a high enough rank; both women wanted an Alpha.

Well, good luck. Most Alphas are arrogant, obnoxious, and rude; they truly believe that they are the Goddess‚Äô gift to women.

The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday‚Äîmy eighteenth‚Äîthe day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

‚ÄúDo you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?‚Äù Maris‚Äôs sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram‚Äôs betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs coming, Maris‚Äî‚Äù I stopped myself, flinching. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get it right away.‚Äù

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. ‚ÄúSee that you do. I‚Äôd hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. ‚ÄúHonestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.‚Äù

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. ‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äù

As I turned to leave, Maris‚Äôs voice stopped me in my tracks. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt call me Maris like we‚Äôre equals. It‚Äôs Luna Maris to you.‚Äù Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn‚Äôt argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn‚Äôt I smell mine?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just another day,‚Äù I whispered to myself. ‚ÄúKeep your head down, and it‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

But it didn‚Äôt feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That‚Äôs when it hit me‚Äîa scent unlike anything I‚Äôd ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‚ÄòMate.‚Äô

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn‚Äôt think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‚ÄòThat‚Äôs our mate!‚Äô Siena said enthusiastically. ‚ÄòGo fast. I want my mate.‚Äô

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Thorne.

I couldn‚Äôt believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I‚Äôve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‚ÄòMate,‚Äô I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn‚Äôt he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‚ÄòNo, go to him!‚Äô Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

‚ÄúAlpha Bram!‚Äù she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn‚Äôt even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I‚Äôd felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‚ÄòNo, he is our mate.‚Äô She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I‚Äôd dreamed of this moment‚Äîthe day I‚Äôd find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn‚Äôt even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn‚Äôt stop bleeding. I didn‚Äôt know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram‚Äôs cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn‚Äôt even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

# Chapter 2

Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram‚Äôs father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack‚Äôs servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù she said, stepping closer. ‚ÄúIf it isn‚Äôt our little orphan, sniveling like a child.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

‚ÄúI know what happened,‚Äù she said, her voice dripping with venom. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.‚Äù She crouched down, her face close to mine. ‚ÄúWe knew it long back. But you‚Äôre nothing. You‚Äôll always be nothing. Bram doesn‚Äôt want you. He‚Äôll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you‚Äôll wish you‚Äôd never set foot in this pack.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

‚ÄúIf you tell anyone‚Äîanyone‚Äîabout this,‚Äù she continued, her voice low and dangerous, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?‚Äù

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

‚ÄúGood. Now clean yourself up. You‚Äôre pathetic. I don‚Äôt want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you‚Äôll regret it if they come to know the reason.‚Äù Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn‚Äôt end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. ‚ÄúYou are reassigned to work in the toilets!‚Äù she barked at me. ‚ÄúStay there until you get a new duty. Don‚Äôt you come out of that place!‚Äù

I balked as I stared at her. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. ‚ÄúDid you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!‚Äù

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris‚Äôs order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn‚Äôt done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone‚Äôs scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. ‚ÄúReya, don‚Äôt let her get away with that,‚Äù she said, her tone filled with anger. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs nothing but trouble.‚Äù

It didn‚Äôt take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve caused enough problems,‚Äù Reya sneered immediately. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time you learn a lesson.‚Äù And then came the blows. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

‚ÄúAlpha Bram,‚Äù Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. ‚ÄúAuren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.‚Äù She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúHow dare you?‚Äù Alpha Bram cut me off and roared in anger. ‚ÄúThrow her in the dungeons!‚Äù he ordered.

I was stunned. It was me, his mate, who was bleeding, and he didn‚Äôt even have a heart to respond to that. How naive of me to think of his coming to save me. This was just a perfect plan for them to get rid of me. And just like that, Maris and Reya dragged me to the dungeons‚Äîa dark, damp hole beneath the pack house where air was thick and musty, and the only light was coming from a single flickering torch.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll stay here until we decide you‚Äôve learned your place,‚Äù Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. ‚ÄúFucking bitch.‚Äù

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

‚ÄúGet up,‚Äù she said sharply. ‚ÄúAlpha Bram has called for you.‚Äù

I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don‚Äôt you? His bride will never last. You‚Äôll be dead within a year.‚Äù She gave me a sly smile.

My heart dropped to my stomach. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said in a weak voice. ‚ÄúHe can't do that. I‚Äî I‚Äî‚Äù It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.

‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. ‚ÄúYou dimwit,‚Äù she retorted. ‚ÄúDid you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You‚Äôll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it‚Äôs a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.‚Äù

# Chapter 3

Auren POV

As Reya dragged me out of the dungeons, my heart drummed against my ribcage out of pure fear. I couldn‚Äôt even think of marrying Alpha Lucien, not just because he was cursed, but also because Alpha Bram was my mate. The idea was abhorrent. It was better to die than to marry Alpha Lucien.

Summoning up whatever little energy I had left in me, I pulled my hand out of Reya‚Äôs and thought of running towards the forest that surrounded our pack. Once I got away from here, I was sure I would find help.

But the truth was cruel. I stood up, and the next second, my legs felt weak and my body collapsed. With a loud ‚Äúbump‚Äù, I fell to the ground, so did my hope. The dust stung my lungs, my tears welling up in an instant. ‚ÄúNo‚Äì‚Äù I struggled.

‚ÄúHa, you think you can escape?‚Äù Reya caught my neck with great force, turning my face to her. I couldn‚Äôt see her face clearly, but I assumed an evil smile there. ‚ÄúGet her.‚Äù She ordered before throwing me to the ground.

Two warriors jumped right in front of me. My eyes widened in horror. ‚ÄúPlease leave me alone!‚Äù I begged them. ‚ÄúLet me live.‚Äù

As if my words irritated her, Reya came into my line of vision again. She directly charged at me and tackled me to the ground. She punched my side and I heard a crack. It meant that one of my ribs had fractured. A scream ripped out of my throat as my body turned numb in pain. ‚ÄúLive? You are so pathetic. Pick her up!‚Äù she ordered the warriors. One of them hauled me over his shoulder with no mercy to my fractured rib. As I screamed and cried and begged them to leave me, they carried me all the way to a little room in the omegas‚Äô quarters and slammed the door shut behind them.

I pounded on the door, shouting, coughing blood. ‚ÄúPlease leave me. Please.‚Äù But no one listened. Eventually, I slipped down on the floor with blood-stained clothes.

I don‚Äôt know how many hours went by when I heard the door creak open. I lifted my head only to see the pack's healer. ‚ÄúLuna Maris has sent me to you. Drink this draft,‚Äù he ordered. ‚ÄúIt will reduce your pain.‚Äù

‚ÄúC‚Äîcan I talk to her?‚Äù I asked.

He clenched his jaw and without replying to me, forced me to have the draft and left, locking the door behind him.

I felt so weak and helpless that I sat against the wall as fresh tears sprang from my eyes. ‚ÄúThis is not justified, goddess,‚Äù I said aloud. ‚ÄúIt is not my fault that you bestowed Alpha Bram as my mate.‚Äù Alpha Lucien was the most ruthless Alpha in the north. ‚ÄúWhat have you written for me in this life?‚Äù

The door opened again and this time Alpha Bram walked in. He narrowed his eyes at me and scrunched his face. Shaking his head, he said, ‚ÄúHow could the moon goddess bestow you as my mate? There must have been some mistake. You are so pathetic!‚Äù

With my eyes wide open, I stared at him with rage simmering in my chest. Feeling horrible under his gaze, I retorted, ‚ÄúI am not pathetic. You are pathetic! You are rejecting your moon-mate.‚Äù

He let out a growl and in a flash of a second, he grabbed my throat with his large hands. ‚ÄúAuren!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúHow dare you say that to your Alpha? You had the guts to run away and defy my orders.‚Äù

I started sputtering and coughing as he squeezed my airway.

‚ÄúBram!‚Äù Maris entered the room and shouted at him. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that. Tomorrow she is going forever!‚Äù

Alpha Bram shoved me away and got up, still growling. And then came out the poisoned words,

‚ÄúI, Alpha Bram Reed of the Crimson Howl Pack, reject you, Auren Cressida as my mate.‚Äù

‚ÄúNoooo!‚Äù I shrieked as sharp pain stabbed my stomach and heart. My vision blurred and I doubled over, unable to move. Through my blurry vision, I saw Alpha Bram and Maris glaring at me coldly. Maris smirked and holding his hand, she walked out of the room, locking the door behind me.

‚ÄúI will send Reya to dress her up tomorrow,‚Äù I heard her voice before I fainted.

When I woke up next, I felt numbness in my body. Seina had howled and whimpered all night and eventually rolled up in a ball and tucked away somewhere, where I couldn‚Äôt reach her. She was more hurt than I was.

Morning light was filtering in my room. It was a morning of doom. I didn‚Äôt have the strength to get up and do anything. I had lost my appetite. When the door opened again, I saw Reya entering with a box in her hand, followed by a maid.

She chuckled. ‚ÄúWhat a wretched bitch!‚Äù She pulled me up roughly. ‚ÄúLuna Maris has sent me to dress you up. But first you need a bath. You stink like a rotten critter.‚Äù

She dragged me to the bathroom where she opened a cold water shower. I shivered under it uncontrollably, but she was least bothered. When I came out, she threw a dress at me. ‚ÄúWear this. Alpha Lucien will be here in an hour.‚Äù

I gaped at her with horror. Alpha Lucien was coming so fast?

The dress loosely hung over my shoulders. From the smell of it, I knew it was Maris‚Äôs old one.

Reya‚Äôs face lit up with a shrewd grin. ‚ÄúCongratulations, Auren. You are getting married to the most unwanted Alpha in the north. Consider yourself lucky that you will live another year while serving as his breeder.‚Äù

Chills ran down my body at the way she said it to me, and my knees felt wobbly. I walked shakily behind her until I reached the main hall.

The place was buzzing with activity. All the omegas were preparing for Alpha Lucien‚Äôs arrival. Maris was giving orders to them and as soon as she saw me, she sniggered. She jerked her chin to Reya who nodded and took me to a corner of the room. My eyes went to Alpha Bram who was talking to some people. Why was it that the rejection affected me and not him? Did his wolf not feel the pain? Tears came into my eyes again, but this time I refused to let them out because I didn‚Äôt want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me broken and shattered.

A few minutes later, he went out and when he returned, he was with Alpha Lucien. The most terrifyingly beautiful wolf I‚Äôd ever seen.

Towering at over six feet, his broad shoulders and chiseled physique radiated raw power. Midnight-black hair framed a cold, sharp, angular face, with dark eyes that seemed to pierce your soul. There were tattoos of vines and thorns on his muscular arms. His presence was magnetic yet menacing, like that of a silent, dangerous predator cloaked in charm.

When our gazes locked, I gasped and my cheeks heated.

# Chapter 4

Lucien POV

The council chamber of the Shadowfang Pack was stifling, filled with the heavy presence of my pack‚Äôs Elders. They had serious expression, their faces weathered with age and experience and their eyes carrying the weight of centuries of tradition. I stood before them, my arms crossed, my jaw tight as they droned on about duty and heirs.

‚ÄúYou cannot keep delaying this, Lucien,‚Äù Elder Orlan said in a sharp voice. ‚ÄúThe pack needs an heir. Without one, we risk losing everything we‚Äôve built.‚Äù

I clenched my fists, the sharp points of my claws pressing into my palms. ‚ÄúAnd what happens to the woman you force me to marry?‚Äù My voice was cold, laced with a simmering anger I couldn‚Äôt contain. ‚ÄúShe will die, just like the others who died marrying my ancestors.‚Äù I really wanted to put an end to this.

Elder Ryna, the oldest among them, leaned forward, her pale gray eyes penetrating. ‚ÄúWe know the cost of the curse. But the survival of the Shadowfang pack must come first. Your power keeps us strong, but strength alone will not secure our future.‚Äù

Their words were like iron chains around me, dragging me back to the nightmare I lived every day. The curse‚Äîa cruel legacy of my bloodline‚Äîhad claimed every bride my forefathers had taken. On the night of the full moon after our bond was sealed, death would come for them, slowly, silent and final. Within a year they all died. How many women will die just to carry my bloodline?

It was said that centuries ago, the moon goddess cursed our Alpha bloodline for betraying love or breaking a sacred bond. Rejections happened all the time, but I don‚Äôt know why did the goddess curse my forefather? What was special about that mate bond?

I turned away, pacing to the window. The moon hung low in the sky, veiled by storm clouds. ‚ÄúYou think an heir will fix this?‚Äù I said bitterly. ‚ÄúThe curse will take them too. It doesn‚Äôt just stop with my bride.‚Äù

Orlan sighed heavily. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know that. There is a chance...‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no chance!‚Äù I snapped, spinning to face them. ‚ÄúThis curse is absolute. It doesn‚Äôt matter how strong I am or how much the Alphas of the North grovel for my alliance. They want my strength, not my curse.‚Äù

Ryna‚Äôs gaze didn‚Äôt waver. ‚ÄúStrength is what keeps us alive, Lucien. That‚Äôs why they seek you, despite the curse. It‚Äôs why we must ensure your bloodline continues. Without you, the North falls.‚Äù

Their words were upsetting, not because I disagreed, but because I knew they were right. The Shadowfang pack thrived because of me‚Äîbecause of the power I wielded. Alphas from all corners sought my favor. Their alliances were a testament to my strength. Yet beneath it all, I was hollow, bound by a curse that tainted everything it touched.

Elder Orlan said, ‚ÄúThere is an offer from Alpha Bram. An alliance in exchange for one of his omegas as your bride. She‚Äôs expendable to him, but this alliance will secure his loyalty. It is a solution that benefits us all. He has been seeking your alliance from a long time.‚Äù

An omega. My stomach churned at the thought. I had no use for alliances built on the backs of weak and innocent. As such I disliked Bram. He was a slimy bastard.

I closed my eyes, the weight of their stares pressing on me. ‚ÄúIf I agree, this alliance must serve the pack above all else.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Ryna said, leaning back in her chair with satisfaction.

The decision settled like a stone in my chest. I would take another bride, knowing her fate, because I had no other choice. I was twenty-seven already and hadn't found my mate. And I knew that I couldn‚Äôt love my forced bride. Ever.

\---

The journey to Crimson Howl was uneventful, but my thoughts roiled with every mile. When we arrived, I noticed the pack house was bustling. Bram greeted me with a wide smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to have you here, Alpha Lucien.‚Äù I grunted in response.

He guided me to the main hall of his packhouse. ‚ÄúThe omega I promised,‚Äù he said, gesturing toward the far corner. ‚ÄúAuren.‚Äù

My gaze followed his hand, landing on her. My breath hitched. Auren had golden hair that caught the light. She was small, barely reaching my shoulder, and she was trembling like a deer in headlight. Her face was soft like that of an elf, her presence fragile. She looked pale and thin as if she hadn‚Äôt had food for days. Her head was slightly bowed, but not out of submission‚Äîit felt like she was trying to disappear.

As she stepped forward, her scent hit me‚Äîa sweet, warm fragrance of apples that stirred my wolf. For a moment, she lifted her eyes to mine. They were gray, like that of a pale moon veiled in mist.

‚ÄúAlpha Lucien,‚Äù Alpha Bram said, snapping me out of my thoughts. ‚ÄúI hope she will serve the purpose,‚Äù he added like she was a commodity. He stood beside me exuding false camaraderie. His grin was tight and it wasn't difficult to see through him. This was not a gesture of goodwill‚Äîit was a business transaction, plain and simple. I didn‚Äôt like the way his gaze lingered on her.

As for Auren, I didn‚Äôt care for her fragility or her fear. What roiled my insides was the blatant manipulation behind this so-called alliance. I had no intention of entertaining this charade. Yet I had no choice.

‚ÄúPrepare the treaty,‚Äù I said flatly, not sparing her another glance.

Bram's face flickered with excitement. ‚ÄúOf course, Alpha Lucien. I‚Äôll have it drawn up immediately.‚Äù

I turned to leave, but a commotion stopped me in my tracks.

‚ÄúWorthless girl!‚Äù Maris‚Äôs voice rang out, dripping with venom. I knew who Maris was. Bram‚Äôs future Luna. A gold digger. Her father had approached me to marry her, but I had refused not because I had come to know of her plans of divorcing me and taking away half my money in less than a month, but because she was a repulsive creature. And now she found Bram. They fitted well.

I pivoted, my sharp gaze locking onto the scene. Auren was being yanked by her arm by Maris‚Äôs rough grip. The poor girl winced, her free hand attempting to shield herself.

Maris‚Äôs lips twisted into a sneer. ‚ÄúYou should be grateful for this opportunity. You don‚Äôt deserve to breathe the same air as us, let alone be offered as a bride to Alpha Lucien. And now you‚Äôre making us look bad?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough.‚Äù My voice cut through the air like a blade.

Maris froze, her grip slackening on Auren‚Äôs arm. She turned to face me, her expression quickly shifting to one of false innocence. ‚ÄúAlpha Lucien, I was just‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care for your justifications,‚Äù I said coldly. ‚ÄúBehave yourself.‚Äù

Maris‚Äôs face reddened, but she protested, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just an omega. She should know her place that she is nothing but a breeder.‚Äù

I took a step forward, my presence towering over hers. ‚ÄúHer place is no concern of yours. Do not test me.‚Äù

Surprised, Maris swallowed hard as she left her. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she muttered.

I shifted my attention back to Bram. ‚ÄúEnsure your pack members know how to act in front of me,‚Äù I said, my tone laced with a warning.

Bram clenched his teeth, glaring at Maris. ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm sorry Alpha Lucien.‚Äù His gaze landed on Auren again, and this time I could see the lust.

Not liking it one bit, I gestured to Tarian, my beta. ‚ÄúHandle her,‚Äù I said curtly, referring to Auren. ‚ÄúGet her packed and ready. We leave in two hours.‚Äù

Tarian nodded with a neutral expression, approaching her.

As I turned to leave, I felt the faintest pull of something‚Äîa whisper in the back of my mind urging me to look back. I ignored it. This was not my choice, and I would not let sentiment cloud my judgment.",1,1754133870.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

[US defense industry vulnerable to China, government watchdog warns](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2025/08/01/us-defense-industry-vulnerable-to-china-government-watchdog-warns/)

[Many components used in key weapon systems are being manufactured by China and other countries with adversarial aims to the U.S., GAO warned in a report. Here, Lockheed Martin employees work on the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter production line in Fort Worth, Texas, in 2012. \(Defense Contract Management Agency\)](https://preview.redd.it/zkppgjzwvkgf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a1efe003aed99c8256a6c666e09ce04fc024c15)

The U.S. defense industrial base and all branches of the U.S. military depend heavily on materials produced by China to make and use critical weapon systems, creating national security risks, a¬†[government watchdog](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107283)¬†warned in a recent report.

The Defense Department relies on a global network of over 200,000 suppliers for its weapon systems and military equipment and uses the Federal Procurement Data System database to flag materials and components originating from hostile countries.

However, this database currently ‚Äúprovides limited information about the countries of origin,‚Äù a July 24 Government Accountability Office report found, and federal contractors are not currently contractually obligated to tell DOD where all of their manufacturing components originate from.

***Of over 99 materials total identified by DOD in shortfall for fiscal 2023, none were made in the U.S., GAO noted.***

***The result is that many components used in key weapon systems and military equipment are being manufactured by China and other countries with adversarial aims to the United States.***

# ‚ÄúThese suppliers may cut off U.S. access to critical materials or provide ‚Äòback doors‚Äô in their technology that serve as intelligence pathways,‚Äù GAO said.

China, a global supplier of critical mineral components used in microelectronics and battery production, illustrated that risk in 2024 when it imposed export restrictions on gallium and germanium ‚Äî two minerals described by GAO as ‚Äúcritical for military-grade electronics.‚Äù

In another instance cited by the watchdog, manufacturing of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was brought to a standstill due to the discovery of Chinese components during production. Although the fighter is being produced with the aid of seven allied partner nations ‚Äî including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and several European Union countries ‚Äî magnets included in the warplanes originated from China.

**‚ÄúThe F-35 prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, identified prohibited Chinese magnets in the F-35 supply chain and notified DOD in 2023 and 2024. DOD subsequently paused manufacturing for several months to identify alternative suppliers,‚Äù according to the report.**

Meanwhile, the U.S. naval¬†[shipbuilding industry](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2025/01/08/navy-shipbuilding-plan-would-cost-1-trillion-over-the-next-30-years/)¬†‚Äî particularly with regard to¬†[submarine production](https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2025/07/11/delays-in-navys-next-gen-submarine-threaten-us-seapower-report-says/)¬†‚Äî is also being impacted by its reliance on foreign supplies, GAO found. Submarines require titanium casting for critical vessel components, but the U.S. at present lacks the capacity to cast titanium due to limited supply as well as outdated equipment to forge it into weapon systems.

‚ÄúThe U.S. has only one foundry that can produce large titanium casting required for some key weapons systems,‚Äù the report noted.

Although DOD has noted the risk of foreign dependency, GAO said, it has taken no action to implement any recommended improvements, which would include efforts toward more detailed and transparent tracking of the country of origin of critical military components.

‚ÄúOne untested approach that DOD officials stated could give DOD more visibility into foreign dependency risks is to contractually require suppliers to provide the information,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúWhile some DOD officials assert the information is readily available, others stated this approach may be too costly or that suppliers may not be willing to provide information.‚Äù

Boeing has expanded a long-term agreement with ATI Inc. for supply of titanium alloy products, which are critical raw materials and components in aircraft production. The specific terms of the deal remain undisclosed, but ATI noted its products will be in place on all of Boeing‚Äôs commercial aircraft.

For ATI, the significance of the new agreement may be the scope of its supply of titanium-alloy plates, sheets, and coiled products following its recent start-up of a greenfield rolling plant in¬†[Pageland, S.C.](https://ir.atimaterials.com/news-events/news-details/2025/ATI-expands-portfolio-to-produce-Titanium-Alloy-Sheet-for-aerospace/default.aspx)

""This agreement highlights ATI's critical role in the titanium supply chain and validates our strategic investments‚Äîespecially in expanding capacity and advancing titanium alloy sheet capabilities,"" stated president and CEO Kimberly Fields.

ATI supplies high-performance materials and components in titanium and titanium-based alloys, nickel- and cobalt-based alloys, and specialty materials. It will be supplying Boeing with titanium-alloy long products, including ingots, billets, rectangles, and bars, as well as flat-rolled products.

Securing supplies of titanium will help to stabilize Boeing‚Äôs supply chain, which in recent years has seen various disruptions and complications impact the OEM‚Äôs manufacturing programs. With China and Russia being major sources of titanium raw materials, deliveries are potentially vulnerable to disruptions from geopolitical tensions, unreliable suppliers, and unstable pricing.

Titanium alloys are critical to aircraft design due to their high strength-to-weight ratio as well as corrosion-resistance and ability to withstand high temperatures. They‚Äôre found in airframes, landing gear, and engine components.

# JULY 30th, 2025~Rare Earth Demand to Triple by 2035: Can the U.S. Catch Up with China?

[Rare Earth Demand to Triple by 2035: Can the U.S. Catch Up with China? ‚Ä¢ Carbon Credits](https://carboncredits.com/rare-earth-demand-to-triple-by-2035-can-the-u-s-catch-up-with-china/)

https://preview.redd.it/gppzpdx37lgf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=70bb8e6378e26fd1061a21da0cfbb6e672d08669

Rare Earth Elements (REEs) play a vital role in the global transition to clean energy and advanced technology. Known for their magnetic, luminescent, and electrochemical traits, these 17 elements are widely used in high-tech applications‚Äîfrom electric vehicles and wind turbines to medical devices and defense systems.

As the¬†[energy transition](https://carboncredits.com/global-energy-transition-renewables-achieve-cost-parity/)¬†accelerates, global demand for REEs is set to surge, raising major concerns around supply chain stability and geopolitical risks.

# Magnet REEs Demand Set to Triple as EVs and Wind Power Take Off

A McKinsey¬†[report](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/powering-the-energy-transitions-motor-circular-rare-earth-elements#/)¬†reveals that global demand for magnetic rare earth elements is projected to triple‚Äîfrom 59 kilotons in 2022 to 176 kilotons by 2035. This sharp rise is driven by booming¬†[electric vehicle](https://carboncredits.com/global-ev-trends-growth-challenges-and-the-future-of-electric-mobility/)¬†adoption and the rapid expansion of wind power projects.

Neodymium (Nd) and praseodymium (Pr) form the core of REE magnets, while dysprosium (Dy) and terbium (Tb) are added to enhance performance in extreme conditions. Although magnetic REEs make up only 30% of REE volume, they account for over 80% of market value.

The demand surge is outpacing efforts to substitute REEs with copper coil magnets. Without sufficient supply, the world could face a 60-kiloton shortage by 2035‚Äîroughly 30% of projected demand.

***The energy transition will likely lead to a surge in demand for magnetic***  
***rare earth elements, with market balance tied to mining quotas in China***

# China‚Äôs REE Dominance: A Double-Edged Sword

China¬†[currently controls](https://rareearthexchanges.com/news/china-ree-dominance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)¬†over 60% of global REE mining and more than 80% of refining. This dominance in the REE supply chain poses a major challenge for other countries. Light REE mining and refining are expected to remain concentrated in China through 2035 unless other regions ramp up production significantly.

Heavy REEs, critical for wind turbines, EVs, and robotics, are mostly mined in the Asia-Pacific region but still primarily processed in China. As a result, countries worldwide are scrambling to develop local REE supply chains. But even with rising investments, most current pipelines are unlikely to meet near-term demand.

# Trade Tensions Trigger Rare Earth Supply Shocks

In April 2025, Beijing imposed export restrictions on several rare earth products in response to U.S. tariffs and tech restrictions. This caused rare earth magnet exports to the U.S. to plummet, disrupting global supply chains and forcing automakers outside China to partially suspend production.

However, following new trade agreements in June, shipments rebounded sharply. Reuters¬†[reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-exports-rare-earth-magnets-us-surge-june-2025-07-20/)¬†that China‚Äôs exports of rare earth magnets to the U.S. jumped 660% month-over-month in June to 353 metric tons. Yet, global export levels remained 38% lower compared to the same month in 2024, showing the lingering effects of supply disruption.

# America‚Äôs Untapped Rare Earth Potential Could Shift Global Dynamics

The¬†[U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimates](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf)¬†that the United States has 3.6 million tons of measured and indicated rare earth resources. They are primarily in California, Alaska, Wyoming, and Texas. Canada boasts an even larger potential, with more than 14 million tons of identified REE resources, spread across Ontario, Quebec, and the Northwest Territories.

The only active rare earth mine in the U.S. is located at Mountain Pass, California, operated by¬†[MP Materials](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). In 2024, it produced approximately 45,000 tons of REO (rare earth oxide) concentrate, valued at $260 million. However, the ore is still mostly shipped to China for final processing, highlighting a critical gap in domestic refining capacity.

In southeastern U.S. states like Georgia and North Carolina, monazite‚Äîa phosphate mineral rich in rare earths‚Äîis being recovered as a byproduct from heavy mineral sands. Companies like¬†[Energy Fuels](https://www.energyfuels.com/About-Rare-Earths-Monazite/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)¬†and¬†[Ucore Rare Metals](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/06/04/tech-metals/dod-funds-ucores-final-rare-earths-push/2308.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)¬†are exploring new separation facilities and pilot-scale processing plants to close the refining gap and build end-to-end domestic REE supply chains.

Meanwhile, Canada has over 20 advanced rare earth projects in development, with several aiming to become commercial by the late 2020s. Notably,¬†[Vital Metals](https://vitalmetals.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)¬†began small-scale production at its Nechalacho project in the Northwest Territories in 2021. Also¬†[Appia Rare Earths & Uranium Corp](https://appiareu.com/appia-announces-significant-geochemical-critical-ree-assay-results-at-alces-lake-project-saskatchewan-canada/). is advancing its Alces Lake project in Saskatchewan.

**Together, these efforts mark a strategic push by North America to reduce dependency on China. However, challenges remain, including long permitting timelines, environmental review hurdles, and the high cost of separating and refining REEs domestically.**

**""IF""**\- NioCorp executes on its current trajectory, it won‚Äôt just be¬†*another*¬†supplier ‚Äî it will be the¬†**flagship U.S. source**¬†for multiple critical minerals at once,¬†**uniquely DFARS-compliant**, and aligned with both defense and clean energy priorities. That would make it¬†**indispensable**¬†to the U.S. industrial base and its allies going into 2028 and beyond.¬†As the United States and its allies race to secure supply chains for critical minerals, the Department of Defense has taken extraordinary steps ‚Äî including a $400 million equity investment in MP Materials, now its largest shareholder ‚Äî to accelerate domestic rare earth production. However, MP‚Äôs historical reliance on Chinese separation and its ongoing \~8% ownership by Shenghe Resources, a China-based company, raise red flags regarding DFARS compliance, intellectual property risks, and long-term strategic control. **While MP is being positioned as a transitional partner**, these entanglements pose serious challenges for defense contractors and private industries that must adhere to strict U.S. sourcing requirements under current and future procurement laws.¬†

¬†In contrast, **NioCorp Developments Ltd.¬†represents the emerging model for a fully U.S.-based, vertically integrated critical minerals supplier**. With a single, highly permitted site in Nebraska, NioCorp is advancing toward production of¬†**Niobium, Scandium, Titanium (and TiCl‚ÇÑ), and Heavy/Light Rare Earths**¬†‚Äî all vital for hypersonics, aerospace alloys, SMRs, EVs, and permanent magnets used across defense and commercial platforms.

The company has distributed mineral samples to national labs (AMES), defense-linked programs (such as Project Pivot), and aerospace innovators (Boeing U.K. & IBC), and has confirmed active talks with both government and private-sector buyers. Its current infill drilling campaign (completing August 2025) and forthcoming DFS (Q4 2025?) could significantly expand projected output ‚Äî positioning it to begin construction in May 2026?? and production by mid-2028 **(all T.B.D.

With no foreign ownership, full DFARS compliance, and a diversified critical mineral portfolio tailored to strategic U.S. supply chain needs,¬†**NioCorp is on track to become a premiere, Tier #1 flagship supplier**¬†‚Äî not only to U.S. defense contractors, but to the broader industrial and allied base as geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions intensify.

The company stands at the inflection point of federal funding eligibility, potential offtake agreements, and strategic investment interest. If financing and agreements fall into place over the coming year, NioCorp could emerge as¬†**the most secure and scalable U.S. alternative**¬†to Chinese and transitional supply chains

1mfo45g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForceTech/comments/1mfo45g/explore_if_the_best_travel_router_glinet_mango/,Explore if the Best Travel Router GL.iNet Mango Lives Up to Its Hype,"Testing out the GL.iNet GL-MT300N-V2 has been an interesting journey. This small yet mighty travel router, affectionately nicknamed ‚ÄúMango,‚Äù surprised me with how practical it is for its size. As someone constantly on the road, I‚Äôve relied on it to secure public networks and establish private Wi-Fi connections. The compact design and portability instantly appealed to me, and as promised in the specs, it slid right into my travel bag without taking up space.

**Portable and Compact Design**  
The first thing I noticed was how incredibly tiny this device is. Weighing just 1.41 ounces and measuring only 2.28 x 0.98 x 2.28 inches, it‚Äôs honestly no burden to pack for any trip. It slips into even the smallest of bags. Despite its size, it has a simple yet functional design that doesn‚Äôt seem overly delicate or flimsy. I took it along on several trips and even left it tangled with cables in my bag ‚Äî no scratches or damage. It's ideal for travelers who, like me, prefer technology that doesn‚Äôt scream for attention but just gets the job done.

**Easy Setup**  
Having set up countless tech gadgets, I expected some frustration here, but the GL-MT300N-V2 defied my expectations. Connecting it via Ethernet or Wi-Fi was refreshingly easy. The admin panel, accessible via mobile or desktop browser, felt intuitive. For someone like my cousin, who‚Äôs technologically shy, the step-by-step interface would make this device a breeze to work with. Whether it‚Äôs personalizing your network settings or just checking the connection, each feature works seamlessly. Out of curiosity, I tested its ‚Äúrepeater mode‚Äù at a coffee shop with questionable Wi-Fi, and, voila, the connection stabilized immediately.

[Check GL.iNet GL-MT300N-V2 price on Amazon.](https://headphonegeek.com/p/b073tsk26w/)

**Favorable Attributes**  
Several key features stood out while using this pocket router:
- **Convenience for Hotel Wi-Fi:** Its ability to convert public wired or wireless networks into private Wi-Fi is a game-changer when staying at hotels.  
- **Compact Power Source Options:** Powering it via a USB cable or power bank kept it running without needing a wall outlet constantly.
- **OpenVPN Compatibility:** This pre-installed client came in handy for ensuring my browsing remained secure while using a hotel network.

Its performance consistently delivered on what it promised, ensuring I could tether devices without interruptions. Whether it‚Äôs for streaming videos amidst travel chaos or simply keeping devices secure from the lurking dangers of public networks, the Mango stood firm.

**Areas of Concern**  
However, this little gadget isn‚Äôt without its criticisms.  
- **2.4GHz Wi-Fi Only:** Although sufficient for most basic needs, anyone expecting blazing-fast speeds might want to look elsewhere.  
- **Limited Power Adapter Range:** While powering it through USB is convenient, it doesn‚Äôt ship with a DC adapter, which felt like something of a miss.  
- **Bulkier Set-Ups:** People looking to connect it to high-end VPNs might find themselves fiddling with manual configurations.

These aren‚Äôt deal-breakers but definitely things to keep in mind, especially depending on the nature of your trips.

**Performance Overview**  
Over a few months of trying this pocket router in diverse settings, its overall performance proved remarkably solid. While the speed doesn‚Äôt compare to higher-end routers back home, security and convenience outweigh the modest hiccups in speed. Its 128MB RAM and 16MB flash storage also enabled reliable performance when running routine tasks. I even connected four devices at once and didn‚Äôt notice any lag while scrolling social media or reading emails.

**Product Comparisons**  
The Mango‚Äôs closest competitors in my tests were the TP-Link TL-WR802N and the RavPower FileHub. While the TP-Link device offered similar portability, it wasn‚Äôt as easy to configure and lacked OpenVPN support. Meanwhile, the RavPower alternative, though feature-rich, felt bulky and less portable compared to Mango‚Äôs compact build. Where Mango excels is its intuitive interface and hotel Wi-Fi repeater functionality; however, faster models from brands like Netgear could be more suitable for users prioritizing speed over portability.

**Price Performance**  
Given the features jam-packed into such a petite package, this travel router offers excellent value. With its ability to safeguard networks in public spaces and adaptability for different setups, the cost feels justified. I‚Äôd recommend it to digital nomads, frequent business travelers, and even simple tech enthusiasts looking for lightweight yet powerful network solutions. While it might not suit someone searching for lightning-fast Wi-Fi speeds, its portability convenience should outweigh that drawback.

Even something as simple as the lighting ‚Äì radiant and open vs. dim and cozy ‚Äì can change the perceived importance of different areas.

I'm curious what others think. Are there any examples of spaces where the spatial hierarchy actively *hinders* the intended use?

## Key Features Analysis

The collapsible cup offers several noteworthy features that contribute to its overall functionality and convenience.

**Material Composition:** Collapsible cups are primarily constructed from food-grade silicone, a material known for its durability, adaptability, and heat resistance. High-quality silicone ensures that the cup can withstand repeated use and exposure to varying temperatures without leaching harmful chemicals into beverages. Some models also incorporate BPA-free plastic components for added structural support and lid construction. The silicone material is also easily cleaned, making it a hygienic option for daily use.

**Collapsing Mechanism:** The core innovation of a collapsible cup lies in its ability to fold down into a substantially smaller size. This is achieved through a series of concentric rings or pleats molded into the silicone body. When not in use, the cup can be compressed accordion-style, reducing its height by as much as 75%. The collapsing process is typically smooth and intuitive, requiring minimal effort. Some models utilize a screw-top or snap-lock mechanism to secure the cup in its collapsed state, preventing accidental unfolding during transport.

**Lid and Seal Design:** A well-designed lid is crucial for preventing spills and maintaining beverage temperature. Premium collapsible cups feature airtight seals achieved through silicone gaskets or O-rings integrated into the lid. These seals ensure a secure closure, minimizing the risk of leaks, even when the cup is inverted or shaken. the lid material is typically BPA-free plastic,chosen for its rigidity and resistance to cracking. Some lids also incorporate a flip-top opening for convenient sipping on the move.

**Temperature Resistance:** Collapsible cups are designed to withstand a wide range of temperatures, making them suitable for both hot and cold beverages. High-quality silicone can typically handle temperatures ranging from -40¬∞C to 230¬∞C (-40¬∞F to 446¬∞F). This allows users to safely pour boiling liquids (e.g., tea or coffee) or ice-cold drinks without damaging the cup.

1mfnxec,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlitchPicks/comments/1mfnxec/reveal_the_best_business_laptop_asus_zenbook_14x/,Reveal the Best Business Laptop ASUS ZenBook 14X Worth Buying?,"Testing the ASUS ZenBook 14X has been quite an experience for me. With technology evolving as quickly as it does, I‚Äôm always on the lookout for laptops that combine performance with portability. The ASUS ZenBook 14X is marketed as a business laptop, but it felt like it was designed for nearly anyone who values efficiency, style, and reliable day-to-day performance. After spending weeks with it, both marveling over its strengths and identifying areas that could use some tweaking, here‚Äôs my take.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right off the bat, the sleek and lightweight design stood out. Weighing just 3.09 pounds and measuring 0.67 inches thin, it feels incredibly portable without compromising on durability. The matte gray finish adds a touch of sophistication. I carried it in my backpack during a work event, and it barely added any weight, which was a relief after a long day of moving between presentations. Its US MIL-STD 810H military-grade certification gave me the confidence that accidental bumps or drops wouldn‚Äôt damage it too easily. The hinge mechanism felt smooth, and opening the laptop was satisfying; no flimsy build here.

**Performance Capabilities**  
The performance was a highlight for me. Powered by Intel‚Äôs 13th Generation Core i5-13500H Processor, the laptop managed every task I threw at it. Whether I was analyzing spreadsheets, editing photos, or juggling multiple tabs during research, there wasn‚Äôt a single instance of lag. The integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics handled light gaming and basic video editing capably. While it‚Äôs not a gaming powerhouse by any means, casual games like Sims 4 or older titles worked smoothly. If you‚Äôre someone who needs their laptop for productivity and a bit of creative work, this one checks a lot of boxes.

**Display ‚Äì A Real Eye-Catcher**  
The ZenBook 14X absolutely blew me away with its screen. Its 14.5-inch OLED touch display is not just sharp but vibrant with its 2.8K resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. The Pantone Validation and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut made colors pop beautifully, which my graphic designer friend loved when he borrowed it for a quick logo mockup. Using it under bright lighting wasn‚Äôt an issue either, thanks to a commendable brightness of 550 nits. But the glossy display? That‚Äôs where glare became a bit of a nuisance in outdoor settings, something to consider if you work frequently outdoors.

**Battery Life That‚Äôs Hit or Miss**  
One critical aspect for users like me who are always on the go is battery life. Thanks to its 70Wh battery, this laptop can push through about 8‚Äì10 hours under moderate usage. Streaming videos, casual browsing, and document editing didn‚Äôt drain it too quickly. However, under heavy workload situations like running virtual machines or multitasking resource-heavy software, it struggled to last as advertised, giving me roughly 4‚Äì5 hours. The fast-charge technology became my saving grace during such instances, and I was able to juice it up during quick coffee breaks.

[Check ASUS ZenBook 14X price on Amazon.](https://multipowers.com/p/b0cdl3cqhv/)

**Positives**  
The ZenBook 14X packs several features any potential buyer would appreciate.  
- The comfortable backlit chiclet keyboard provided an enjoyable typing experience, even during late-night sessions.  
- Connectivity options were excellent with Thunderbolt 4 ports for fast transfers and HDMI for presentations.  
- The AI camera and noise cancellation feature were a game changer during virtual meetings. My coworkers even remarked on how crisp and clear my feed was.  

**Shortcomings**  
While many aspects impressed me, there were some noticeable flaws.  
- The 8GB RAM, while LPDDR5, might feel limiting for heavy multitaskers or professionals handling more complex projects like 3D rendering.  
- Non-upgradable memory is definitely a letdown for longevity enthusiasts.  
- The glossy display is prone to smudges and fingerprints, which made me feel slightly obsessive about constantly cleaning it.

**Direct Competitors**  
Looking at alternative offerings like the Dell XPS 13 or the HP Spectre x360, the ZenBook 14X carves out its niche well. The OLED display on the ASUS outpaces the Dell XPS in terms of color reproduction, making it ideal for editors and designers. However, the XPS offers better options for memory expansion. As for the Spectre x360, its convertible design and extended battery life make it a strong contender, but the ASUS provides a sharper, faster screen. If you‚Äôre drawn to aesthetics and portability while maintaining robust performance, this product certainly holds its ground.

**Price Performance**  
While exploring whether this notebook was a worthy investment, it was crucial to consider its price compared to competitors. This laptop provides value for its high-end display, efficient processing power, and sleek design, which all feel premium for its class. However, the fixed RAM could make buyers with more demanding needs hesitate. Depending on your priorities, the ZenBook 14X can either be a hit or something you may need to rethink.

We hit it off right away. We opened up quickly about life, struggles, goals, and I eventually met many of his friends and family. It genuinely felt like we were building a solid, meaningful friendship.

Over time, though, I started noticing how rigid and argumentative he could be. Conversations often turned into debates (even when they didn‚Äôt need to be) and he always needed to be right. Still, I supported him a lot. I gave him relationship advice, career tips, and tried to be there when he needed someone. I honestly thought the support went both ways.

Fast forward to earlier this year, we got into a conversation about politics. He told me he a DJT supporter and asked about my views. I said I leaned liberal. His immediate response was, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs probably just because of your dad.‚Äù I explained that while my upbringing influenced me, my beliefs are still my own. He laughed and said, ‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù I told him I didn‚Äôt want to quantify it, but he kept pressing, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to assume a lot,‚Äù and then tried to argue that I actually agreed with him more than I realized. It didn‚Äôt feel like a discussion, it felt like a takedown.

The next day, I texted him to say I didn‚Äôt appreciate how he boxed me in about politics and made assumptions about me. I wasn‚Äôt trying to fight, I just wanted to express how it made me feel. He replied saying he doesn‚Äôt like texting and wanted to talk in person.

We met at Starbucks (I even bought him a coffee) and it all blew up. He went off, saying I was trying to bring him down to my level, that I have low self-esteem, that I‚Äôm controlling, untrustworthy, and that I ‚Äúlove conflict"" and that I sound like the devil. It was just one personal insult after another. I reminded him of all the ways I‚Äôve supported him‚Äînot to guilt-trip him, but to show I‚Äôve always been in his corner.

He ended the conversation by saying, ‚ÄúThis friendship is over,‚Äù and told me to get up and hug him. I declined but offered a handshake, which he took. Then he walked away.

After that, I sent him one final message and blocked him:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel bad about myself, Charles, nor do I have low self-esteem. I‚Äôm okay the way I am‚Äîmaybe even better than others in some ways. This apology thing bothered you so much that you resorted to insults and bad words against my character. People make mistakes‚Äîeven you joke about it when it happens‚Äîbut today, you took it seriously in a way that felt unnecessary and cruel. I don‚Äôt want to be friends after this. I don‚Äôt deserve that kind of treatment or disrespect. Ciao for now.‚Äù

Since then, I‚Äôve stopped going to his church and haven‚Äôt had regular contact with him for seven months. Here‚Äôs where things get even weirder.

A few weeks ago, I noticed multiple random accounts adding me on¬†**Snapchat**¬†(bogus names that show they've just been created), and I strongly suspect it was him (or someone connected to him) trying to monitor me or bait me into contact. When I messaged one of them saying I knew who it was and ive contacted the authorities regarding this, I got 2 more adds then the adds stopped for 2 whole weeks.

Then more recently, I got a¬†**Facebook friend request**¬†from an account that was literally just created (it had only one photo of a woman and no mutual friends). I messaged it out of curiosity, and when I asked about the location on their profile being in another country, they said ""yeah thats how it is here"". It felt off. This ""girl"" also body claimed out of the blue that im ""scared of her personality"" when we've only exchanged like 2 messages prior. It‚Äôs purely speculative, but given the timing and context, I can‚Äôt help but wonder if this too is connected to him or someone in his circle.

## Key Features Analysis

The adjustable height coffee dining table is characterized by a well-engineered lifting mechanism and a durable construction. These features allow for a seamless transformation between different height settings and ensure the longevity of the product.

**lifting Mechanism:** the core of any adjustable height table is its lifting mechanism. Most models employ a gas spring or mechanical lever system to raise and lower the tabletop. Gas spring mechanisms provide a smoother and more controlled adjustment, while mechanical levers tend to be more robust and require less maintenance. The range of height adjustment typically spans from 15 inches (coffee table height) to 30 inches (dining table height), offering ample flexibility.

The lifting mechanism is usually constructed from high-strength steel or aluminum to withstand repeated use and heavy loads.Some tables feature a locking mechanism to secure the tabletop at the desired height, preventing accidental collapse or movement.This ensures stability and safety during use.

**Tabletop material and Finish:** The tabletop material varies widely, wiht options ranging from solid wood to engineered wood, glass, and metal. Solid wood tops offer a classic and luxurious look, while engineered wood (such as MDF or particleboard) provides a more affordable and durable alternative.glass tabletops are modern and easy to clean, but they may be more prone to scratches and fingerprints. metal tabletops are robust and industrial-chic, but they can be cold to the touch.

The finish is crucial for both aesthetics and protection. Common finishes include lacquer, veneer, laminate, and powder coating.Lacquer offers a glossy and durable finish, while veneer provides the look of solid wood at a lower cost. Laminate is highly resistant to scratches and stains, making it ideal for high-use areas.Powder coating is a durable and environmentally kind option for metal tabletops.

**Frame and Base Construction:** The frame and base provide the structural support for the table. They are typically made from steel, aluminum, or wood. Steel frames are strong and durable, while aluminum frames are lightweight and corrosion-resistant. wooden frames offer a warm and natural aesthetic. The base design can vary from a simple four-leg configuration to a pedestal base or a trestle base.

A well-designed base provides stability and prevents wobbling, even when the table is fully extended. Some tables feature adjustable feet to compensate for uneven floors. The base should also be aesthetically pleasing and complement the overall design of the table.

**Size and Shape Options:** Adjustable height coffee dining tables come in various sizes and shapes to suit different spaces and preferences. Common shapes include rectangular, square, round, and oval. Rectangular tables are ideal for larger groups and formal dining,while square tables are better suited for smaller spaces and casual meals. round tables promote conversation and create a more intimate setting. Oval tables combine the benefits of both rectangular and round shapes.

The size of the table should be proportional to the size of the room. A table that is too large will overwhelm the space, while a table that is too small will feel inadequate. Consider the number of peopel you typically need to accommodate when choosing the size of the table.

## Core Benefits

Adjustable height coffee dining tables offer various practical benefits to users,making them a valuable addition to any home. These benefits range from space optimization and versatility to enhanced comfort and convenience.

**Space Optimization:** Adjustable height coffee dining tables are ideal for small apartments, studios, and condos where space is limited. They serve dual purposes, eliminating the need for separate coffee and dining tables. This saves valuable floor space and creates a more open and airy feel.For example, in a small apartment, the table can function as a coffee table during the day and transform into a dining table at mealtimes. This eliminates the need to store a bulky dining table when it is not in use. The adaptability is invaluable in environments where space is at a premium.

**Versatility and Adaptability:** These tables are highly versatile, adapting to various needs and activities. They can be used for dining, working, playing games, or simply relaxing with a cup of coffee. The adjustable height allows users to customize the table to their preferred height for different activities.

As an example, the table can be raised to dining height for family meals and lowered to coffee table height for movie nights. It can also be adjusted to a comfortable height for working on a laptop or playing board games. This versatility makes it a practical and functional piece of furniture for any lifestyle.**Enhanced Comfort and Ergonomics:** Adjustable height coffee dining tables can improve comfort and ergonomics, especially for individuals who work from home or spend long periods of time at the table. The adjustable height allows users to find the optimal height for their posture, reducing strain on the back, neck, and shoulders.

Moreover,the table can be adjusted to accommodate different users,such as children or individuals with mobility issues. This ensures that everyone can use the table comfortably and safely. The ability to customize the height promotes proper posture and reduces the risk of musculoskeletal problems.

## FAQs Section

Many consumers considering an adjustable height coffee dining table have common questions about their functionality, durability, and maintenance. Addressing these questions provides clarity and helps potential buyers make informed decisions.**How easy is it to adjust the height?**
The ease of adjustment depends on the type of lifting mechanism used.Gas spring mechanisms generally offer smoother and easier adjustment than mechanical levers. Most tables require minimal effort to raise or lower, often involving a simple lever or button.

The adjustment process typically takes only a few seconds, making it convenient to switch between different height settings. Some tables also feature a locking mechanism to secure the tabletop at the desired height, preventing accidental movement.

**What is the weight capacity of the table?**
The weight capacity varies depending on the table's construction and materials. Most adjustable height coffee dining tables can support between 50 and 100 pounds. It's crucial to check the manufacturer's specifications before placing heavy items on the table.

Exceeding the weight capacity can damage the lifting mechanism or the tabletop, perhaps leading to instability or failure. Ensure that the weight is evenly distributed across the tabletop to prevent excessive stress on any particular area.

**How durable are these tables, and what is the maintenance required?**
The durability of the table depends on the quality of the materials and construction. Tables made from solid wood, steel, or high-quality engineered wood tend to be more durable than those made from cheaper materials.Regular cleaning with a damp cloth is usually sufficient to maintain the table's appearance.

Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the finish. Protect the tabletop from scratches and stains by using coasters and placemats. Periodically check the lifting mechanism and tighten any loose screws or bolts.

Not the ""I have no friends"" kind, because I do have a circle I can call mine. But the thing is, most of them are either family committed or have kids or just on a tight budget, which makes spontaneous hangouts nearly impossible. And I totally get it. I'm not trying to make them sound bad. Life is life, and responsibilities come first.

Still, it gets to me sometimes. There are days when I just want to go out, take nice pictures, laugh over coffee, or explore a new place, and it hits me that I don‚Äôt have that kind of girlfriend group or just one one-call-away friend who‚Äôs free or down to do that with me. The kind you can message on a random afternoon and say, ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs go somewhere,‚Äù and they‚Äôre actually free to go.

It‚Äôs not about being clingy or needing attention. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I miss that connection. That ease. That freedom to enjoy things with people who match your energy and pace. I guess I‚Äôm just feeling a little left out of the kind of social life I wish I had.

Has anyone else felt like this at some point in their life? What did you do to deal with it? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.

Thanks for reading.

I wanted to share something that might resonate with those of you feeling burnt out in Bangalore or looking for a trip that‚Äôs more than just sightseeing.

I recently explored the idea of [Varanasi tour packages from Bangalore](https://www.sstourandtravels.com/varanasi-tour-packages-from-bangalore.php), and honestly‚Äîit‚Äôs not just a vacation, it‚Äôs a reset. ‚ú®

For the uninitiated, **Varanasi** (also known as Kashi or Benares) is one of the oldest living cities in the world. It sits on the banks of the Ganges and is considered a deeply spiritual hub for Hindus. But even if you're not religious, the place has this raw, ancient energy that‚Äôs hard to describe until you experience it.

Coming from Bangalore‚Äîtech capital, traffic, endless coffee shops‚ÄîVaranasi is like stepping into another dimension. The contrast is wild but also really peaceful in its own way.

# üí° Why consider a tour package?

* Local transport

* And if you‚Äôre spiritually inclined, options for rituals like **Ganga Snan** or **Pind Daan**

# üåÖ What‚Äôs the actual experience like?

The trip usually kicks off with the **Ganga Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat**‚Äîthis is unreal. Priests waving lamps, chants filling the air, and the Ganges glowing with diyas. You‚Äôll remember it forever.

Next day? Early morning boat ride on the river. Seeing the ghats come to life with rituals and sunrise vibes is oddly meditative.

You can also explore **Sarnath**‚Äîwhere Buddha gave his first sermon. It‚Äôs perfect for history nerds or anyone who enjoys quieter spots with depth.

And between all the temples and rituals, you still get downtime‚Äîroaming the narrow alleys, grabbing chai, tasting the street food, and checking out **Banarasi silk weaving** in action. It‚Äôs cultural immersion in the best way.

# üßò Bonus Experiences

A lot of these packages also offer:

* Yoga by the Ganges
* Heritage walks

I have on many occasions talked to family and friends about dreams i have had. They often ask me how I know what they were up to, or say I they had the same dream where I was the main character in it when I tell them about a dream I had about them. 

The weirdest experience I ever had was when I visited Hawaii for the first time in my life. I had 2 kids a little older than I was come up and talk to me and asked me who I was. I was very confused but also recognized them just wasn‚Äôt sure how or from where. They said I looked exactly like someone they dreamt about. I told them that‚Äôs crazy. My mom ended up letting me hang out with them for a while which was cool. We went to the big asf mall on Oahu and chilled. Got food and then they invited me over for dinner. 

When we got to their house it was a small yellow house, looked EXACTLY like one I had a dream of. The mom was a single mom and she claimed to recognize me as well asking me to remind her of my name. She kept saying sorry for not remembering my name. I told her and she explained that‚Äôs right and gave me a drink. Every detail of this house, inside and out, even the place accord the street were exactly like my dreams.. 

This isn‚Äôt the first time either. I dreamt of a coffee shop I‚Äôd never been to, a record shop and cafe in one. Kinda cool ig. But after my dream of this place the ppl in my dream were there, I knew their names, and they ‚Äúguessed‚Äù my name. This happens a lot.

I don‚Äôt do drugs, no drinking, and I‚Äôm not missing days either. My friends asked me to tell them stories about their lives that I would have no way of knowing and I can get them all nearly spot on after thinking and sleeping on it for a couple nights. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that I have predicted 3 family members deaths to within a week, and even illnesses. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to make of any of this. But when I want to ‚Äúdream walk‚Äù I meditate with a certain object and fall asleep holding it. During my meditation I think about the individual, the location, of general area and I see it. I feel it and exist there. Then I wake up and haven‚Äôt moved and just feel super tired.

Kendu Energy and Kendu Coffee started this endeavour and has greatly motivated and encouraged other holders to do the same. We now have a pretty extensive list of initiatives, which retail will love.

As we all know crypto has been the subject of many bad actors, including leaders of countries, celebrities and cabals, this has tarnished crypto's reputation in the eyes of the average person, can we blame them for being cautious of crypto?

Honestly, no we can't.

But here's where Kendu's IRL efforts come in, these IRL efforts show that Kendu has substance and has something¬†**physical**¬†behind our efforts, we wont just disappear tomorrow, we are here to stay and grow for multiple cycles. Kendu's real world efforts show¬†**proof of humanity**¬†in a world where AI and bot use has become quite rampant.

Kendu although evolving the memecoin space has not stopped pushing on social media, we are arguably the biggest presence on Reddit, Stocktwits, whilst both having very strong efforts on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. Social media efforts are still very important imo but they aren't the full picture anymore.

Shib, Doge and Pepe evolved the space in their time, but Kendu is the current coin to evolve the space, we are taking it to a level never been met before. Kendu has the potential to give holders the largest return on investment this cycle. We have no ceiling, We are unstoppable and We are changing the game.

1mfnlb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROCD/comments/1mfnlb8/my_partner_isnt_outdoorsy_and_it_makes_me_want_to/,My partner isn‚Äôt outdoorsy and it makes me want to end things everyday.,"Been with my partner 2.5 years. So far so good, mostly. No issues. He‚Äôs handsome, kind, gentle, everything I could realistically want in a partner, except one aspect - he‚Äôs not outdoorsy. 

Basically.. I‚Äôve always been someone (especially as a kid) who loves the outdoors. I don‚Äôt hike much but I love the beach, rock pools, finding little creatures and beautiful flowers. Also love foraging for mushrooms although I‚Äôd love to really get in touch with this side of myself way more now I‚Äôm an adult - regain the love. One difference with my partner is he isn‚Äôt the ‚Äòoutdoorsy‚Äô type. He‚Äôs not against it. And we do travel/take trips when we have the collective funds. But he‚Äôs quite happy, sat indoors playing video games on his 1-2 days off per week. He‚Äôs not very active, he‚Äôs not very confident. He‚Äôs just happy ‚Äòexisting‚Äô as he‚Äôs once put it. There‚Äôs no hunger in him to go paddleboard or to go kayak or to make some friends to go rock climbing with. Or even any other hobby besides gaming tbh. He does have a bit of creativity in him but not enough really to warrant a bit creative hobby he keeps revisiting. 

I‚Äôd love a partner who has a routine other than; wake up, go on phone and doomscroll for 45 minutes, make a coffee, turn on PC and load up video games. 

I like video games too. Some days I spend all day on them if I really lose track of time. But I also value, prioritise and get way more excited about going outdoors. If I suggest something, he‚Äôs normally happy to come along with me (like a walk or a little hike) but there‚Äôs just minimal appreciation for it really. He doesn‚Äôt hate it but he‚Äôll just express that ‚Äúit was good yea‚Äù and that‚Äôll be it. Idk if it‚Äôs because I have ADHD that I can really feel super passionate about lots of things easily and I‚Äôm just expecting too much from someone else? But this lack of passion/love for the outdoors is something I can‚Äôt move past even through ROCD. Yes - I know ROCD nitpicks, but truly I feel this is unfortunately an area he lacks, that I‚Äôd love to have within him. 

Feeding on from this, the ‚Äòoutdoorsy‚Äô look. I love the way outdoorsy men dress; little caps, boots, loose trousers that aren‚Äôt joggers or jeans. Earthy colours and jackets. Maybe some jewellery and someone who takes pride in their appearance. My partner, I love him but he‚Äôs so low on self esteem that he wears the same clothes over and over which are 3X his body size because of his body dysmorphia. I‚Äôve dealt with the same thing so I get it, but I don‚Äôt know when he‚Äôll be confident enough to branch out. He wears merch of his favourite rapper and doesn‚Äôt have a lot of money for more clothes. He‚Äôs studying for a better job but ultimately it‚Äôs a very slow process and he‚Äôs not passionate about anything enough to have the drive and passion to do it. 

I met a new woman at work this past week and she was showing me photos of her and her partner and her partner was the exact spitting image of the ‚Äòideal‚Äô type of guy I‚Äôve just described above! The dress style, the calm nature, showing me photos of their road trips in a little van to the highlands and mountains going hiking, and him with his love for plants and building terrariums or having some exotic pets. And his job being a conservationist. That‚Äôs obviously her fianc√© and something I‚Äôd never get involved with - but my point being he was the exact type of guy I‚Äôd love, and it almost sent me into a spiral thinking well ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not like this, and this is what you want, so it‚Äôs probably time to leave‚Äù etc. 

Realistically, it should feel easy to end things with someone who‚Äôs not providing you with what you want.. but the thought of breaking up with him devastates me. Idk how people do it with partners who have done no wrong, who have been nothing but amazing and kind for you all these years. He‚Äôs such a lovely partner but I worry we‚Äôre not truly compatible. I guess everyone in every relationship could be MORE compatible than they are with a partner, but I guess it‚Äôs how willing you are to handle those differences without feeling they‚Äôre an issue. I want a partner to be able to help me identify little plants and creatures, or who has his own hunger for getting out in nature. We can go to camping festivals with bushcrafts together or pagan celebrations (none of which my partner and I have done). I know ROCD has its ways, but I think this is an issue for me tbh. Or maybe I‚Äôm thinking idealistically. I know I can break up with any person for any reason - but genuinely my partner is one of the most handsome men I‚Äôve ever laid eyes on, he‚Äôs so kind and gentle with my neurodivergence and OCD and he‚Äôs helped me through a lot. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that great in relationships tbh. My ADHD can make me quite lazy in a lot of aspects and I‚Äôm trying to grow in myself, I started jogging, I am trying to be more confident in my body with clothes and I‚Äôm being more sociable. But he doesn‚Äôt seem to grow? Or he grows at a pace much slower that agitates me? 

What to do :( I think about breaking up with him everyday, to the point I have probably withdrawn a little - but there are real incompatibilities. I‚Äôve dated so many people in my life and somehow, these past couple years, have finally grown into knowing what it is I need and want from a partner. Looking back, I was never really compatible with anyone and it was all superficial, genuinely. People that went to the gym or rode motorbikes or were accountants for work. All of these things are great but none of them were hungry for the outdoors.. none were interested in nature or had passion for anything outside of gym/video games etc. It devastates me to think of losing him and his family (they‚Äôre literally like my own üò≠) but I think at this point of growth in my life, I‚Äôd be very excited to see what else life has to offer me. We also live together with minimal savings each so I‚Äôd have no idea what would even happen with this. The Autism in me would struggle with finding a new journey/solution for me through this change. I don‚Äôt earn much and I can‚Äôt afford to rent alone. I also can‚Äôt stay with family unless it‚Äôs a caravan in the garden situation. Although I‚Äôd be sad, the idea of breaking up has been a thought that‚Äôs approached me both in panic-ROCD-mode but also during my ‚Äòsane‚Äô everyday calm thoughts. It makes me kinda mad that I never made finding an outdoorsy guy to be my priority when dating him/others. I just found anyone attractive and through most in these apps, dates I went on etc, he was so much more calm, kind, gentle than all of them. 

I keep seeing the whole ‚Äúeven if you love someone, it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre right for each other‚Äù‚Ä¶ but somehow ending things feels horrific and like the end of the world. I know I‚Äôll cope, but even now, I still search up my ex‚Äôs on social media and spy on what they‚Äôre up to. For no reason other than to be nosey. And I get upset when they seem a lot happier than they were with me. I know I‚Äôm getting way ahead of myself but I think I‚Äôve mentally checked out a bit, besides ROCD. The only times in the past I‚Äôve seemed therapy, I‚Äôve discovered I was just unhappy in my relationship and broke up, moved on. I‚Äôm scared now that I‚Äôve got therapy starting next week, I‚Äôll discover that it‚Äôs just time to break up and move on again but I‚Äôm nearing my late 20‚Äôs and don‚Äôt wanna keep on and on and on. I hate dating people, I really do. I know reading this, you probably all think that writing all this is so sad on him and I agree :( I just can‚Äôt help it :( it‚Äôs weird seeing the type of guy you think will be great for you, not even a super idealised one.. but seeing them actually exist in the world and that it‚Äôs not some incredibly difficult, idealistic thing you‚Äôre imagining MAY be out there - having proof this type of person exists is like the mic/drop moment. Like the ‚Äúthere is this out there if you go find it‚Äù moment.  Truly, I don‚Äôt know if this is all strong enough to waiver a 2.5 year awesome relationship. We‚Äôve spoken about marriage, kids, houses, even got a puppy at one point which sadly didn‚Äôt go to plan for no reason of our own. We‚Äôre just cruising along in life at the moment, but I don‚Äôt wanna live with ‚Äòless than‚Äô and miss out on outdoorsy fun things just because it‚Äôs not his thing - I wanna share my passions. But If I end things and we both move out and move on, I know I‚Äôll deeply regret it all and miss him dearly. The thought of him kissing another girls forehead. When she‚Äôs crying or the thought of him helping another girl devastates me. ",2,1754131764.0,ROCD,1,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best oversized candles of 2025 are characterized by their premium ingredients, remarkable craftsmanship, and long-lasting performance. We've analyzed several top contenders based on key technical specifications to provide a thorough understanding of their value.

**Wax Composition:** The quality of the wax is paramount for a clean, even burn and optimal scent diffusion.Many premium oversized candles utilize a blend of natural waxes, such as soy, coconut, and beeswax.Soy wax is favored for its eco-friendliness and slow burn, while coconut wax offers excellent scent throw and a creamy texture. Beeswax, known for its purifying properties, adds a subtle honey aroma and helps to eliminate pollutants from the air. The combination of these waxes creates a superior burning experience, minimizing soot and maximizing fragrance. A high-quality blend ensures the candle burns evenly, preventing tunneling and maximizing its lifespan.

**Fragrance profile:** The complexity and richness of the fragrance are crucial to the overall sensory experience. Top-tier oversized candles employ carefully curated fragrance oils and essential oils to create multi-layered scents that evolve over time.

The fragrance profiles typically consist of top notes, heart notes, and base notes, which unfold gradually as the candle burns. Top notes provide the initial impression, heart notes form the core of the fragrance, and base notes linger for a lasting effect. The use of natural essential oils contributes to the authenticity and therapeutic benefits of the scent. Brands are increasingly focusing on unique and refined fragrance combinations to set their candles apart.

**Burn time:** One of the primary benefits of an oversized candle is its extended burn time,providing hours of aromatic enjoyment. A well-crafted oversized candle should offer a burn time ranging from 100 to 200 hours,depending on its size and wax composition.

Manufacturers carefully calculate the ratio of wax to wick size to ensure a consistent and controlled burn. Regular trimming of the wick is essential to maximize burn time and prevent smoking. Factors like room temperature and airflow can also affect the burn rate.Longer burn times provide a greater value per candle, reducing the frequency of replacements.

**Container Material:** The container not only holds the wax but also contributes to the candle's aesthetic appeal and longevity. Common materials include glass,ceramic,and metal,each offering its own set of advantages.

Glass containers provide a clean and modern look, allowing the candle's flame to shine through. Ceramic containers can be more decorative, adding a touch of artistry to the candle. Metal containers are durable and often used for candles with a rustic or industrial aesthetic. The material's thickness and heat resistance are important factors in preventing cracking or shattering during burning.

**Wick Type:** The type and number of wicks play a critical role in the candle's burn performance. Oversized candles typically feature multiple wicks to ensure an even melt pool and optimal scent diffusion.

Cotton wicks are a popular choice for their natural composition and consistent burn. Wood wicks offer a crackling sound reminiscent of a fireplace, adding to the ambiance. The size and placement of the wicks are carefully calibrated to match the candle's diameter and wax composition. properly sized wicks prevent tunneling and ensure that the entire surface of the candle melts evenly.

Its called Ordinary Drip and the selection focuses on light roasts from roasters around the globe. The idea is bringing roasters in that you rarely or never get in Europe otherwise.

The coffees I got in the first month were S&W (US), Wes Ngopi (Malaysia) and Coffee County (Japan). The ones from the second month were Terraform (China), Hooray (Canada) and Sweetness, a Korean roaster. So far, I‚Äôve been really happy with the coffees, all of them ranged from good to excellent. Did anyone else subscribe and how did you like the coffees?

I had a chat with the guy running the subscription and we talked about which roasters might be featured in the future. I suggested Moonwake and Archers. He already has an interesting list of upcoming roasters, but is open to more suggestions. 

What are your suggestions for roasters that roast light and would fit the subscription?

1mfnj2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GladBeat5447/comments/1mfnj2b/what_it_felt_like_being_a_va/,What it felt like being a VA.,"I just realized how overwhelming‚Äîand transactional‚Äîit is to be a Filipino VA.

It‚Äôs easy to be drawn into this industry, especially with the kind of economy we have and the soul-draining traffic that‚Äôs become part of daily life here. Working from home feels like a dream: no commute, no crowded buses or overpriced fuel, no dressing up unless you want to. I can roll out of bed and straight into work. Take coffee breaks whenever I like. Bathe in the middle of my shift or not at all. Sit cross-legged like a statue in the same spot for hours, wear mismatched, frumpy clothes, and no one would care. The freedom is unmatched.

But what I failed to realize until recently was the cost of that freedom.

The Filipino VA industry is painfully saturated. Not just with talent‚Äîbut with *great* talent. So much so that everyone starts to feel... replaceable. Expendable, even. One minute you're doing well, the next you're out, replaced by someone just as capable, just as skilled, just as eager. And suddenly, this life of so-called ‚Äúwork-life balance‚Äù turns cold. The freedom begins to feel like isolation. The relationship between client and VA, or between agency and contractor, becomes transactional‚Äînothing more than numbers, output, and performance. If you're not perfect, you're a risk. If you're a risk, you're done.

I felt all this‚Äî*truly* felt it‚Äîat 3 AM, in this quiet, empty room. That‚Äôs when my client informed me that he was terminating my contract over a single error in an email.

It was a small detail. The last line should‚Äôve read ‚Äúcustomer service.‚Äù Instead, it said ‚Äúcustomer service name.‚Äù A mistake. A ridiculous one, even. And the frustrating part? I *know* I edited that before sending. I remember doing it. I reviewed it. I double-checked. But somehow, the email went out with the mistake anyway. Was it a glitch? A lag? Did I forget to hit save before send? I don‚Äôt even know anymore. What I do know is that one single oversight, one uncorrected line, was enough to end everything.

The client offered a 15-day notice period. But I couldn‚Äôt accept it. Not because I wanted to be difficult, but because I *understood* what that offer meant. It wasn‚Äôt grace‚Äîit was formality. I knew where it was headed. I knew I‚Äôd be replaced regardless. Those 15 days felt like begging for scraps. Like performing for someone who‚Äôs already decided you‚Äôre no longer good enough. So instead of dragging it out, I resigned.

Yes, the error was mine. And yes, it was inexcusable. But am I not human?

Still, I‚Äôve come to learn that in this industry, being human isn‚Äôt part of the equation. There‚Äôs little to no room for growth, for learning from your mistakes, for bouncing back. Improvement isn‚Äôt nurtured‚Äîit‚Äôs expected, demanded, and if you can‚Äôt deliver *perfectly* every single time, you‚Äôre out.

That‚Äôs the reality I faced. A reality many of us silently endure.

This work may let me stay home, save time, and wear pajamas all day. But it also reminds me, harshly and often, that in a sea of excellence, there‚Äôs no cushion for flaws. No safety net. Just results‚Äîflawless results. And if you can‚Äôt keep up, even just once, you're gone.

Hugs to all working VAs. At the end of the day, we have no choice but to move forward. Laban lang!",1,1754131522.0,u_GladBeat5447,0,1.0,False
1mfnisf,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1mfnisf/35_lost_my_husband_to_cancer_and_my_life_is_just/,[35] Lost my husband to cancer and my life is just ... empty. Advice appreciated,"So, I am really doing this. Out of despair and hopelessness. I will try to share my story, so thankful that a place like this exists.

Sorry if it might get a bit long. Maybe somebody has lost their partner too and might be able to connect.

In March I have lost my husband to cancer. We were both 35 and he had been diagnosed with a rare form of very aggressive tissue sarcoma ten years prior which had lead to the amputation of his left arm. Still, both of us very young back then, we held on to life. Together. Always trying to just make the best of what life threw at us. He was so full of energy, always so positive. He just WANTED to live so bad, but the diagnosis and the loss of his arm weighed heavy on him. But we managed together. I sank into anxiety back then, knowing the overall perspective of his condition were slim. We had been best friends since we were ten and became a couple later in life, so he had just always been there. No matter what happened, he was there, the only real consistent person throughout my life. He had just always been my person.

In 2018 they found spots on his lung but couldn't confirm until 2020 that those were indeed metastasis from the sarcoma back then. They started targeted therapy, preventing the metastasis from spreading and growing further but ultimately - we learned that later - the drugs weakened his lung tissue, leading to lung collapses, more surgaries and ultimatively infections over the years. He never really rested until he collapsed from exhaustion because he wanted to live so badly. And when he collapsed it was always on me to take care of him and things, always trying to make him understand he has chronic pneumonia, he needs to take it slow to get better. I did this for many years until my job and the fear and strain of that, constantly having to see how he wants to live but is restrained by his body and being the ""bad cop"" ... it drained me empty. But I was just content to be with him. As long as I got to be with him, as long as he was still alive, I felt like it was okay to miss out on those things we always had to postpone. Holidays we never got to do because he was too sick, saying we'd do it once he'd be better. I had hope. Always. Maintaining that hope for him was what had kept me going. My love for this wonderful, cheerful person had kept me together. They always just told us it was his chronic pneumonia, he had to take high doses or cortisol. I tried to do everything I could, look for the best doctors, read every book, get every inhaler. Just to do something. But ...

Within those last 1,5 years his lung function got so bad he hardly managed to walk, got weaker all the time until he couldn't leave the house anymore. He lost part of his voice because something in his lung pressed on his vocal chord, which meant he couldn't even see his friends anymore. Eventually we learned that his body indeed was full of metastasis. For the first time there were spots in other parts of his body and new ones had grown in his lung. They told us that they were certain the cancer is back but they needed to do a biopsy to verify. My husband didn't hear any of that. He held on to believing it was just infectious.

During that time, January this year, I had already been on sick leave due to exhaustion and high levels of anxiety and overwhelm. For months I had watched and heard him cough up blood, struggle for air. I hadn't been able to sleep, always afraid he was gonna suffocate. I knew I had to start to accept the fact ... I was going to lose him. And that the time would come when he had to face that too. But everything was just too much. How could this wonderful, cheerful person who wanted to live so badly and was so full of hopes and dreams just die? How could my husband just die? He was hooked up to the oxygen machine at home at that time and pushing all of what was happening away. I tried to stay hopeful for him, because me falling apart ... would have shattered what he needed most: me as his anchor. But I told him, everything was gonna be alright because even if we had to spend the rest of our life on this couch I was happy, because it meant I got to be with him. I just wished for him to have more of this life. And I knew he felt loved. This gives me peace.

I had to call the ambulance in February becuase his pulse was over 150 and his oxygen saturation very very low. Those two weeks were incredibly hard for me. I ran on auto pilot and finally managed to tell his sister (my best friend) about everything. Because he never talked about his condition. To anyone but me, since this would have made things too real I guess. I had ultimately been alone with all of this for a long time. The only person I had opened up to about this had been a good friend of mine living abroad, since I felt like ... she had not been close to my husband. Everyone loved him dearly, I cannot share this with anyone without inflicting pain or having to care for the other person too. We grew very close throughout this. So much even that I consider her one of my best friends now.

They were able to stabilize my husband in the hospital and tried to do a biopsy of his lung but they couldn't. Everything was just bleeding too much. He was supposed to come back home to me on Monday the 3rd of March again, since they had fought back the acute infection once more. One day prior he told me to take a break with visiting, to rest, because he had finally gotten a medicine that helped him breathe and I neednt worry. I should rest, he wants me to relax a bit. I was hesitant, considering to go, but he said he could finally catch up on some sleep. Because he could breathe. He was writing this crying of joy. And so was I. And we would see each other tomorrow. But then, shortly after 6 AM, my phone rang. And they told me he had passed away in his sleep.

My world just crumbled. I just fell apart. I did not know what to say, what to do. How to breathe. How do you go on after that? How did I even manage to croak out that ""no...""? But I did. I managed everything that came after up until this point. It's been five months now and ... I am just getting worse now. I am sorry that this post got so long, I just felt like sharing a bit for context.

I am sitting in this house. Unable to reach out to my friends. And whenever we're together I know It's just fleeting. They all have their own lives, I don't expect anyone to hold mine together now. But I can't do this on my own. I really don't know how to go on like this. These past years have been so much about surviving. Surviving a new bad phase of his illness, recovering from another surgery, deal with the uncertainty ... I wanna live, for the both of us. But how do you go back to life after something like that? Everything seems pointless. I am still on sick leave but lost my job in the meantine. My best friend - his sister - got a baby in May, so while I can go and be with them regularly, I sometimes feel disconnected. My other best friend, the one from abroad, just moved in with me recently because things were not going well for her either and I am happy to provide a safe place for her and just have someone around. It has helped me to get out of bed in the morning, to just have coffee with her. It's good to have her here. She's a very private person though, dealing with her own things, working a lot in her room, so ultimately of course I need to learn how to be by myself.

If it hadn't been for those two I would have fallen apart long ago though. They gave me a routine of saying good morning and good night, we have been reading a book together ... still, I feel lonely. Desperate. Hopeless. I want my husband back. I wanna tell him things, show him things. Just sit and be with him. I am so grateful he is not suffering anymore. It had been so agonizing to see him like this. But ... I just feel lost in this wide world, looking for sense and purpose again. For connection.

I am in therapy regularly and see my psychiatrist once a month too. They both say, as well as my friends, I need to give it time. I just feel like this despair is gonna eat me up alive and I will never get out of it. I had been better in between. More hopeful. And even though I know healing is not a linear process ... I feel so shaken and unsafe. I miss him so much. 

Sorry, this post seems like an unstrucrured mess now. I would be so happy if ... there'd me anybody out there willing to share their experiences or thoughts. Has anyone lost their partner and went through a phase like that? What has helped you cope? I'd be happy to just connect with someone.

I just found out that there are apps giving away legit $$$ just for TESTING new features‚Ä¶ and apparently, I‚Äôve been missing out for MONTHS.

Like‚Ä¶ why did no one tell us using our phones could PAY US? Is this real life? Or a simulation I forgot to beta test? 

Here‚Äôs what sent me down the rabbit hole‚Äî7 top apps for 2025 that actually reward you for just being nosey and clicking buttons. 

Are we digital guinea pigs or smart capitalists? You decide. But either way, somebody sponsors my next coffee.

**My Top 7 Legit Apps That PAY You to Test New Features (How is this a thing?!)**

- **UserTestingX**  
Let‚Äôs start with this absolute BEAST. Ultra simple stuff: sign up, give feedback on the latest features, and get $$$. Got paid $20 for checking out a redesigned settings panel. No rocket science involved. 
**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
It‚Äôs wild how fast they pay out.

- **TestFlight Blitz**  
Apple fanatics, this is your jam. You get sneak peeks at stuff not even out yet and‚Ä¶ yes, PAYMENT. Got $30 just for poking around with a to-do list app clone. Shock level: MAX.  
Find the link here: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

- **FeatureSafari**  
NEVER seen an app so clear about what you‚Äôll earn. Short missions, fast results. Like, DOES Silicon Valley know I‚Äôm running apps for them while snacking on chips?  
Curious? Check it: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

- **UXBounty**  
They actually pay you DOUBLE if you‚Äôre the first to spot a bug! My friend did two feature tests last week and bought dinner with her payout. Why does this feel unreal? Still, I love it.

- **Feedback Fiesta**  
I always thought ‚ÄúFiesta‚Äù = fake party, but dang‚Äîthis is REAL money for 5-10 minutes of effort. There‚Äôs this scoreboard thing, so the more you test, the higher your badge level. Feels like gaming, but with actual cash.

- **TryOut Labs**  
Here‚Äôs one for the productivity nerds: you basically get to break things in new apps, and they love brutally honest reviews. Bonuses for video feedback (my shocked face has basically paid rent at this point).

- **GoodNovel Beta Crew**  
Absolute jaw-drop‚Äîthe amount of beta features on book-reading apps out there is endless‚Ä¶ Test, review, get PAID. I signed up here: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
Plus, the fiction content is weirdly addictive.

HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THESE?!

Is there a glitch in the universe? Because the app economy is unhinged (and I‚Äôm here for it). 

Seriously, whether you have 3 minutes or an hour to spare, I CANNOT BELIEVE how much these companies actually value our opinions. You can literally stack payments just by *being nosy*. 

Don‚Äôt be like me‚Äîdon‚Äôt find out about this a year too late.  
One last trick: sign up through **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** and thank your past self.

Definitely worth the investment for us otr types that stay out for weeks at a time. I loaded mine up with meat from Sam's before I left home and am still eating from that instead of eating truck stop garbage. ",4,1754130943.0,Truckers,1,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

A leopard print ottoman shoudl offer a balance of style, functionality, and durability.careful consideration of its features helps ensure a purchase that meets both aesthetic desires and practical needs.

**Upholstery Material**

The upholstery material is crucial for both appearance and durability. Higher-quality ottomans use materials like faux fur or velvet with a clear,vibrant leopard print pattern. The choice of material dictates the ottoman‚Äôs feel and longevity; Faux fur provides a plush,tactile surface,while velvet offers a luxurious,smooth texture. The most durable options often feature stain-resistant treatments or tightly woven fabrics that withstand daily wear and tear. The quality of the print itself is also vital; Look for sharp, well-defined spots that won't fade or bleed over time.**Frame Construction**

The frame provides the ottoman‚Äôs structural integrity. Solid wood frames, such as those made of hardwoods like oak or maple, are more durable and resistant to warping than those made of particleboard or softwood. Inspect the frame for sturdy joints and secure fastenings, such as screws or dowels, to ensure long-term stability. Padded frames offer added comfort and prevent the fabric from rubbing directly against the hard frame, which can prolong the ottoman's lifespan.

**Filling Material**

The filling material inside the ottoman cushions determines its comfort level and shape retention. High-density foam provides firm support and resists sagging, while feather-down blends offer a softer, more luxurious feel. Some ottomans use a combination of materials, layering foam and fiberfill to achieve a balance of support and softness. The quality of the filling material directly affects how well the ottoman holds its shape over time and how comfortable it is to use as a footrest or seat.

**Size & Shape**

available in various sizes and shapes, the ideal ottoman should complement its intended space and serve the desired function. Smaller, round ottomans are convenient for tight corners or individual use, while larger, rectangular ottomans offer more surface area for multiple users or for use as a coffee table alternative. Consider the ottoman‚Äôs dimensions in relation to your existing furniture to ensure a cohesive and functional layout. The height is also essential; an ottoman should ideally be at the same height or slightly lower than the seating it complements.

**Leg Design & Material**

Legs not only provide support but also contribute significantly to the ottoman‚Äôs overall style.Options range from sleek, tapered metal legs to ornate, carved wooden legs, each influencing the ottoman's aesthetic. Sturdy materials like solid wood or metal are preferable,as they offer better support and durability. Check the leg attachments for secure screwing or bolting to the frame, ensuring stability and preventing wobbling.

Key Features of a high-quality Leopard Print Ottoman include:

* Premium upholstery material
* Robust wooden frame
* High-density foam filling
* Appropriately sized with a functional shape
* Durable legs made of wood or metal

## FAQs section

Navigating the details of buying a leopard print ottoman can bring up questions. It‚Äôs common to wonder about maintenance, styling, and whether the ottoman will truly complement your existing decor.

**how do I clean a leopard print ottoman and maintain its appearance?**

Cleaning a leopard print ottoman depends on the upholstery material. For faux fur,regular vacuuming with a brush attachment helps remove dust and debris. Spot cleaning with a mild detergent and a damp cloth can address stains; always test in an inconspicuous area first. Velvet ottomans require gentle handling; use a soft brush or vacuum with an upholstery attachment to prevent crushing the pile. Professional cleaning is recommended for deep stains and to ensure the longevity of the fabric.Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the print and fibers.

**What are some styling tips for incorporating a leopard print ottoman into my home decor?**

A leopard print ottoman works well in various decor styles, from modern to traditional. In a neutral-toned room, it can serve as a bold focal point, adding personality and visual interest. To complement the pattern, incorporate other animal prints sparingly, such as a small rug or throw pillow. Balance the wild element with solid, complementary colors like black, white, gold, or deep jewel tones. Consider the size and shape of the ottoman to fit seamlessly within your existing furniture arrangement. You can also use the ottoman to tie together different design elements by echoing its color palette in other accessories.

**Can a leopard print ottoman work in a small space?**

Yes, a leopard print ottoman can work in small spaces, but it‚Äôs important to choose the right size and style. Opt for a smaller, round ottoman rather than a large, rectangular one to avoid overwhelming the room. A multi-functional ottoman with storage can help maximize space by providing both seating and storage options. Place the ottoman in a strategic location, such as in front of a sofa or armchair, to serve as a footrest without obstructing the flow of the room. Keep the rest of the decor minimalist to prevent the space from feeling cluttered.

1mfnc0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsReadOfficial/comments/1mfnc0m/i_met_a_demon/,I Met A Demon,"Hey everyone, my names Joey, and I‚Äôve listened to just about every story you guys have submitted so I figured I‚Äôd submit one of my own. This happened in the summer of 2019, and I still think of it to this day‚Ä¶
I live up in the San Bernardino mountains, around 6,000 feet above sea level. A lot of people don‚Äôt realize there are entire communities nestled this high up. My graduating class alone had 300 students. It‚Äôs beautiful, remote, and full of adventure ‚Äî especially for my friends who are paragliders.

If you‚Äôve ever seen those massive kites in the sky with people suspended beneath them, that‚Äôs what they do. You sit in a harness, steer with brake lines, and coast through the mountain air like a bird. There‚Äôs a popular takeoff spot around here known as The Launch.

That evening, a few of us had gathered there to hang out while the last pilot, my friend Jeremy, packed up his wing. The sun had dipped behind the peaks, and a heavy quiet settled in ‚Äî that kind of mountain silence that almost feels alive.

That‚Äôs when a man stepped out of the woods.

He came from the right side of the launch pad, walking toward us with a small dog on a leash. He looked clean-cut ‚Äî sharp haircut, nice clothes, neat. But something about his energy immediately felt‚Ä¶ off.

Jeremy, always the friendly one, called out, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, man?‚Äù

The guy responded in what I can only describe as frenzied gibberish. He was talking fast ‚Äî too fast ‚Äî and the only words I clearly caught were:
‚ÄúShut the F up, mother effer.‚Äù

It gave me tweaker vibes, but that didn‚Äôt match his clean appearance. He was just simply NOT someone you‚Äôd point a finger at and accuse of anything other than a sip of coffee.

As he passed us and moved closer to some of my coworkers who had come up to meet our paragliding group, I wrapped up my convo with Jeremy. He threw his gear in the car, shouted, ‚ÄúGoodnight, y‚Äôall! Love you guys!‚Äù

‚ÄúNight, J! Love you too, dude!‚Äù we shouted back.

The man‚Ä¶ did not appreciate that.

He snapped in a string of obscenities ‚Äî 
Quick fire, rapid paced swearing and cursing us out‚Ä¶

My friend Tyler told him to chill and mentioned that Jeremy was one of the nicest guys on the mountain ‚Äî which he is. But the man didn‚Äôt care. He launched into a rapid-fire rant about his coworkers, using every slur and insult in the book.

At first, I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he just needed to vent. But then things took a dark turn.

He started saying things like:
‚ÄúI hate this stupid effing mountain. I wanna burn it to the ground.‚Äù*
And something that really gave me chills was him saying:
‚ÄúI like lacing people‚Äôs drinks and watching them freak out.‚Äù

I looked over at Tyler, who gave me that ‚Äúis this guy for real?‚Äù expression.

At that time, I worked at a camp for individuals with special needs. Apparently, this guy used to work there too, because he started referring to the campers using a slur I won‚Äôt repeat ‚Äî but it made my blood boil. My little brother is on the autism spectrum, so hearing that hit way too close to home.

I finally cut him off.
‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I asked.

He paused, blinked like it was the first time someone had interrupted him, and said:
‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Dan.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay Dan,‚Äù I said slowly. ‚ÄúWhere do you live?‚Äù

He told me he lived just down the street from The Launch.

Trying to keep the situation from escalating, I calmly told him he was coming across as aggressive, unsettling‚Ä¶ even threatening. I was honest but peaceful.

It didn‚Äôt matter.
As soon as I finished, he went right back into ranting ‚Äî as if I hadn‚Äôt spoken at all.

Eventually, he wandered back to his car. We all breathed a little easier. But not for long.

Dan sped past us ‚Äî flying toward the direction of our camp.

We were all still for a moment, watching his taillights vanish. My gut dropped.

After maybe a minute or two, his car came hurtling back the other way, and then‚Ä¶ he was gone.

The vibe in the air shifted. The fun energy of the evening had drained out completely. Everyone packed up and left.

They all went to a local bar, but Im not really the drinking type, so I was headed back to camp ‚Äî alone.

It was just about midnight when I was getting ready for bed in my Cabin. 
Our camp has five cabins. I was in Cabin 4, the only one occupied that night aside from two admin directors staying on the other side of the grounds, in the infirmary which is about 100 yards away from me 

I was used to being alone here. The cabins were big, outfitted with multiple bunks. I chose the one in the back corner, directly adjacent to the door which was about 20 yards away from my bunk but I still had a clear line of sight to that heavy door 

And that door? It was one of those industrial, heavy-duty kinds with a loud metal locking bar. You can‚Äôt open or close it quietly.

I was brushing my teeth in the cabin bathroom when I heard it 
The unmistakable sound of that heavy door opening.

Footsteps.
Slow. Deliberate. Coming down the hallway toward the bathroom.

Then they stopped. Right outside the bathroom door.

I stood frozen, toothbrush still in hand. My mouth full of toothpaste.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Hello?‚Äù I called out.

Silence.

Five long seconds passed.

Then the footsteps turned and walked away.
I heard the door open again. Then close.

Immediately, I stepped out, expecting to see someone walking down the gravel path outside. But there was no one. There‚Äôs not exactly an easy path anywhere else besides that usual one and I thought it was weird that I didn‚Äôt even hear any footsteps‚Ä¶ let alone see anyone 

Still spooked, I crawled into bed. I was texting a friend, laying with my head right in front of the open window.

That‚Äôs when I heard the footsteps again.

But this time‚Ä¶ they were outside.

Right. Behind my head

There‚Äôs no path back there. Just woods, leaves, and old twigs. No one should be walking back there ‚Äî especially not at this hour.

But I heard it.
Human steps. Crunching. Moving deliberately.

I knew it wasn‚Äôt a bear. Bears are loud, yes, but smoother ‚Äî they shuffle. These steps  were paced. Unfortunately, unmistakably Human.

I heard faint heavy, delayed breathing

My heart jumped. I dropped to the floor and crawled beneath the window.

The steps stopped. Right outside

I didn‚Äôt breathe. Didn‚Äôt move.

Thirty seconds passed, maybe more. Then‚Ä¶ the footsteps faded away.

I waited. Listening. Daring myself to get up.

But then 
The door handle started jiggling.

Three loud bangs
Not knocks ‚Äî bangs
Followed by a long, slow scratch across the metal door.

I texted the two admin directors:
‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ did either of you just stop by Cabin 4?‚Äù

They responded immediately:
‚ÄúNo. We‚Äôve been in our rooms the whole time.‚Äù

Then, just as soon as the banging started‚Ä¶ it ceased. 

I felt sick. My fingers were trembling. I asked them to come by my cabin and thankfully, they did.

Once they arrived, I told them everything. They stayed with me for a while and helped me calm down. Eventually, they got me laughing again ‚Äî but it was hollow. I didn‚Äôt sleep much that night.

And I never saw the man again.

I don‚Äôt know if the guy from The Launch and the person at the cabin were the same. I never saw the person moving around the cabin, Maybe it was a coincidence. Maybe not.
But that was the creepiest night of my life.

I want to start by saying I've been to funerals/wakes before but only outside of the US in my own country. Custom is to wear white or black only to all events related to it with smart casual/semi formal attire. In my country, there is usually a wake/viewing for a week or two followed by mass, procession to cemetery, and burial. Big flower wreaths are usually given by families/work company/etc but individuals who visit the wake usually do not bring flowers or anything of the sort. During the wake, the family of the deceased usually has some snacks or coffee in the viewing room. After mass, there is a procession from the church to the burial site.

I have never gone to any event of that sort in America, but in two weeks will be the funeral/viewing/etc of a family member of one of my friends. I want to handle this with care and be mindful about how things work for a different culture/country. Can someone tell me how similar/different my experience stated above is to how things are generally done in the US?

I don't know what usually happens or really anything about how it works differently from what I know. The deceased comes from a Hispanic family, if that gives any helpful info",1,1754130610.0,NoStupidQuestions,2,1.0,False

So there is hope people!  **My RTC Shared Care Agreement has been accepted by my GP surgery no questions ask** (it would have been nice if they'd let me know but I am not complaining!).

**Application with GP to Shared Care Timeline:**

October 2023 - GP sent my screening form to Psych-UK under RTC

December 2023 - Got a letter from Psych-UK to say I was on their waitlist and had ID forms & another more detailed screening form to fill in, as well as one from husband and someone who has known me from a child - they were happy with my sister as my mum as dementia, and dad was largely absent (and still can't remember that I don't have sugar in my coffee).  I completed these instantly

August 2024 - I went private and got diagnosed Combined type ADHD, tried Atomoxetine\* (I have bipolar 2 so they try you with non-stimulants first).  We tried that for a bit and it kind of worked but made me sleepy (probs should have experimented with dosages more but I was keen to try the stimulants as I'd heard they were more effective).

September - March 2024 - titrated via private clinic on Concerta (methylphenidate) and it worked well, with few side effects

November - 2024 Psych-UK assessed me same Combined type ADHD and was put on titration waitlist.  This was because Psych-UK under RTC have to keep things equal, even though I was happy with my dose. I was told the wait was 8-10 months (it was) - don't get excited when they send you the blood monitor, it doesn't mean things are moving quicker.

March 2025 I thought I would try Elvanse - Lisdexamphetamine given I know people sometimes get better results and I knew that Psych-UK under RTC have a limited titration period & wouldn't be as flexible. Private psychiatrist titrated me on Elvanse and it's just as good as the Concerta, but perhaps a little smoother. So I decided to stay with Elvanse.

June 2025 - I got issued an appt with my RTC original consultant at Psych-UK and he agreed to skip tritiation and write the Shared Care Agreement and sent to my GP.

August 2025 - Shared Care Accepted and prescription added to my repeats!

I realise this is quite detailed and long but I think if might help people who:

\- Are unsure of RTC timelines generally  
\- Have Bipolar and fear they won't get stimulants  
\- People who find stimulants give them too many side effects - \*Atomoxetine does work and is non-stimulant, so do give it a go  
\- Anyone who has gone private and accessed effective meds but can't afford to long term

1mfn8by,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1mfn8by/how_to_appeal_to_the_irish/,How to appeal to the Irish?,"I‚Äôm (26F) from Sweden, and I‚Äôm moving to Ireland sometime next year for my studies. After that, I‚Äôm hoping to stay in Ireland permanently. But first I‚Äôve got some questions for you: 

1.	I went to English speaking schools with English teachers as a kid, so my English vocabulary is decent, and most of the time I sound quite English when I speak. But when I get nervous, I start speaking in a very thick Swedish accent. Will Irish people mind me sounding like a foreigner from IKEA-land? Or worse, like an English person? 

2.	Do Irish people drink tea? I only drink coffee, but I‚Äôm happy to stock up on tea for guests if needed. 

3.	Is the weather really that shit? Because the Swedish weather is also awful. 

4.	How do you make friends in Ireland as an adult? 

5.	Do Irish people like Swedes? 

6.	Coming from an atheist country, is there anything I should keep in mind when it comes to Catholic/religious culture? I don‚Äôt want to act like a dick or be disrespectful just because I don‚Äôt fully get it
