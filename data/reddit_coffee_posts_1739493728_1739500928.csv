1ip0ixi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ip0ixi,Living Room decor help please?,"My roommates and I are moving in to a 2b2b apartment unit and we don’t really have any furniture for the living room. Need some help figuring out what colors would match and help give off a more modern, cozy, relaxing home kind of vibe. The things we need are: a TV stand, a coffee table, and a rug. So, what color combos can we choose from and what are some furniture suggestions?

Things to note: 
- Entire unit has wooden floors and kitchen counters are gray (pic attached of floor color + kitchen cabinets + unit layout). 
- Roommate has a medium gray futon. 
- Prefer budget friendly options that are around $100 and under (per furniture piece).

• Possible TV Stands: IKEA LACK TV Unit (comes in black or white) OR Amazon TV shelf stand (black/white) like this one https://a.co/d/gfufgB7

• Possible Coffee Table: I really like the idea of Lift Top tables but it’s not necessary. https://a.co/d/9nQD6ax (comes in white/black/weird brown.)

• Possible Rugs: IKEA STOENSE Rug (off-white color) OR Amazon Boho Rug (multiple options of striped patterns in different colors)

1ip0cxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1ip0cxu/i_had_a_career_as_a_professional_mourner_during/,"I had a career as a ""professional mourner"" during the 80s. The last assignment I ever accepted nearly got me killed. (Part 1)","*“You sure this is the right place, Hank?”* I shouted from outside the limousine.

The husky chauffeur didn’t respond, attention transfixed on his handheld television, fiddling with the antennae to minimize static. A cold October wind howled through the valley, causing the slit of my black dress to flutter against my thigh. Frustration mounted behind my eyes as I waited for an answer, glaring through the passenger’s side window while shivering from the violent squall.

Getting the sense that he was intentionally ignoring me, I pulled trembling fists from the pockets of my wool coat and improvised a drum solo against the thick glass. My knuckles were so cold that I barely felt them make contact.

The amateur rendition of Van Halen’s *“Hot For Teacher”* was enough to get his attention. A scowl curled up the side of his face. Without moving his eyes away from the blinking screen, Hank leaned over to roll down the window, his beer gut flopping awkwardly over the central console like a pillowcase half filled with maple syrup. He gave the crank two lazy twists, and the window creaked down a few inches.

*“Robin - what the fuck is the matter? It’s the goddamned World Series,”* he said, pointing at the small TV and acting like I was unaware of that fact. Hank had nearly careened off the road multiple times on the thirty-minute drive over here, seemingly unable to drag his eyes away from the game for more than a handful of seconds at a time.

I felt a myriad of insults thump against the back of my teeth, begging to be unleashed, but I swallowed my annoyance.

*“Can you please just look at the sign?”* I pleaded, gesturing to the name listed above a picture of the deceased.

*“…’85 wasn’t our year, but ‘87…’87 is for The Cardinals…”* he muttered, still glued to the feed.

*“Hank, for the love of God, confirm that I’m walking into the right funeral or I’m getting back into the car. I was told the guy’s name was ""‘John’, not ‘Jom’. The damn sign says ‘Jom’.”* I snapped.

Hank slumped his shoulders with childlike exaggeration and sighed. Reluctantly, he shoved a meaty claw into the breast pocket of his blazer, digging around for the instructions given to him by our escort agency. With a crumpled slip of paper in hand, his pupils finally detached from the game. Hastily, he scanned the name and date.

*“Looks right to me,”* he remarked. Before I could ask to see it too, he spat chewing tobacco that had been resting along his gumline into the slip. My eyes widened in disbelief as I watched Hank wrap the paper around the brown-black ichor, only to then toss the malformed lump into his coffee cup.

*“Christ, Hank. You couldn’t have just handed it to me, like a human being? Or are you not a human being? Maybe you're actually some human-shaped donkey? Does that sound right?”*

The insult finally brought his eyes to meet mine. Instead of anger, he shot me a threatening grin. A wolf’s smile, bearing hungry canines in my direction.

*“Look, doll - how about you tiptoe those fragile, porcelain feet up to the home’s concierge and ask about the service? I’ll wait here. If it ain’t right, we’ll go back to the office.”*

He expected a sheepish reply, but I sure as shit didn’t give him one, instead providing a thumbs up with my right hand and a middle finger with my left. I didn’t scare easy. Not only that, but I’ve been in the escort business long enough to know the difference between an actual predator and a small man making empty threats.

When I turned to walk up the cobblestone path that led to the funeral home, my ears became filled with the sound of Hank slamming his foot down on the accelerator, tires screeching against asphalt. Didn’t even bother to turn back around, honestly. No point.

*“Asshole.”* I murmured, securing my purse under my arm to prevent it from blowing away as I approached the opulent, repurposed plantation house.

The mansion’s white pillars loomed over me as I carefully climbed the porch steps, stilettos clacking against the refurbished wood. As I stepped toward the front door, a surge of anxiety unexpectedly sprinted up the length of my spine and planted itself at the top of my neck, crackling around the base of my skull like electricity from an exposed wire. With my heartbeat galloping in my chest, I took a deep breath and twisted the knob, not willing to let nervous energy prevent me from earning my keep.

A lot of what happened to me was out of my control, but I did one thing wrong that day. My gut was screaming for me to turn around. It implored me to sprint back down those stairs and into the street like the devil themself was close behind me, nipping at my heels.

But I ignored the feeling, contorted my face into an expression of grief, and pushed on, unknowingly putting myself into the Cult of the Scarab's crosshairs, intruding on their rite of sacred renewal.

\----------

*“Right this way, ma’am,”* said the funeral director, leading me into a familiar narrow hallway behind the lobby. Only a week earlier I’d been at this funeral home, pretending to grieve over someone else. As we walked, I reviewed the details I’d received concerning the deceased, provided to my agency by his company’s board of investors.

*Pharmaceutical CFO. Passed in his late sixties. Very private. Had two previous marriages. Right hand was mangled during his tenure in Vietnam, doesn’t bother with a prosthetic. Months before his death, rumors of him being gay cropped up in the tabloids.*

*I’m playing his secret lover. An unknown buxom paramour, weeping over the loss of their sugar daddy, dispelling the whispers of his potential homosexuality.*

People purchased my time for an assortment of different reasons. Sometimes, I was hired by the soon-to-be deceased, arriving at their memorial service just to boost the overall number of attendees visibly present and grieving. Other times, the request was more specific and it wasn’t the deceased who was hiring me.

This was one of those *other times.*

It wasn’t glamorous work, lying at some poor sap’s funeral on the behalf of someone else and their interests, but it was much preferable to the labor I performed when I was first hired. Think fishnet stockings and disagreements over the virtues of condom use.

All that said, it'd be disingenuous to say I wasn't proud of myself.

This was my niche, and despite the seediness, it was mine, and I was good at it. Considered an expert, actually. Anyone can show up and be a pretty face in the crowd; a twenty-something with running mascara and a nice ass cartoonishly *boo-hooing* into an open casket. But me? I played the assigned role with tact and nuance. I sold a narrative, and nine times out of ten, my marks bought it.

The key was you needed to be a proficient improviser.

Discretion was the name of the game in my line of work; I rarely got a lot of background information about the deceased to work with. Meant I had to be capable of thinking on my toes - bobbing and weaving through conversations like my life depended on it.

Ironically, though, if I wasn’t so damn convincing, I might not have ended up almost suffocating to death less than an hour after the funeral concluded.

\----------

I expected all the usual sounds of organized memorial would become audible as we approached the reception hall; sobbing, a pipe organ singing its quiet lamentations, hushed arguments over the division of an inheritance. Sounds most people associated with deep sorrow. To me, however, mourning sounded like work. It was ambient noise I had become so accustomed to that I barely even noticed it.

But that’s not what I heard as we drew closer to the service. Quite the opposite, actually. Joyful sounds reverberated down the hallway. As the funeral director opened the door to the reception hall, I heard laughing and the clinking of glasses. The sparkling timbre of a wedding filled my ears, not the joyless dirge of a wake.

I stepped in, and for a moment, I truly believed I was walking in on some kind of themed birthday party. Every attendee sported a pure white outfit, head to toe. The previously jubilant noise fizzled out into dead silence when they saw me enter, adorned in funerary black. I was nearly about to excuse myself back through the door when I spied a young man at the opposite end of the vast room, dressed in a black three-piece suit, leaning wearily against an enormous marble coffin.

*“Is…is this Jom’s funeral?”* I managed to sputter out into the motionless crowd.

The fifty or so funeral goers remained silent. I could tell that something about my arrival was intensely befuddling, with looks of confusion painted over the attendee’s faces. Eventually, the shrill squeaking of poorly lubricated metal wheels broke the silence. The crowd parted to reveal an elderly woman in a wheelchair pushing herself towards me. She peered from side-to-side as she approached, observing the still petrified mourners staring at me with a look of disapproval.

*“Oh, would you relax? Go back to what you were doing. I’ll figure it out. Khepri save us, y’all would be startled shitless by a ladybug if it flew at you too fast,”* she croaked. Slowly, the figures in white pulled their attention away from me, and the lively chatter resumed, albeit at a much lower volume.

With the funeral reanimated, the elderly woman brought her eyes to mine, converting her scowl into a toothy grin. A wispy white dress hung loosely from her skeletal frame, giving her the appearance of a mobility-challenged banshee. The weight of a golden broach pulled the front of her dress forward at the collarbone, revealing the outlines of her upper ribs through thin, liver spotted skin. The accessory was about the size of a golf ball, and it depicted a beetle with what looked like a lotus flower etched onto its wings.

*“And you are, dear?”* she asked, settling in front of me by using a levered brake to halt the wheelchair’s momentum.

Based on the woman’s command of the other mourners and her wizened appearance, I made an educated guess as to her identity.

*“Hi…you must be Jom’s mother?”*

She nodded, her brow furrowing and her grin melting away as her head tilted up and down. The matriarch studied me intensely, her expression now twisted into one of confusion, like those of the mourners when they first saw me.

Relief fluttered through my chest. I briefly savored the pleasurable rush that came after the anxiety of a calculated risk. Then I smiled, took a generous inhale, and continued, launching into an ad libbed speech I had given countless times before.

*""It is nice finally to meet you. I…I wish it wasn’t under these circumstances, and I wish I knew your first name, but you know how private Jom can be-”*

I paused and forced a chuckle, letting tears well up as I broke eye contact - body language that screamed “*I’m struggling to use past tense now that he's dead, oh the sweet misery”*. A sigh fell from my lips, and then I picked up where I left off.

*“…you know how private Jom* ***could*** *be. I’m Tara. Your son and I were together for the last year or so. What’s your first name, ma’am?”*

Unexpectedly, I watched her eyes widen with some mix of alarm and disbelief.

*“It’s…it’s Akila”*

Without saying anything more, she abruptly pivoted her head and torso around, scanning the room for someone. Akila seemingly couldn’t locate them in the crowd, so she just started shouting a name.

*“Horus! Hoooorus! Could someone bring my grandson over?”*

The figures closest to us leaped into action, clearly fighting to be the person that fulfilled Akila’s request. Within seconds, one of the attendees, a hulking middle-aged man with biceps like tree trunks, returned with the kid in the black suit that had been previously leaning against the coffin, practically dragging the miserable looking young man by the wrist to his grandmother.

*“Ah! There you are, Horus.”* Akila cooed.

The boy barely responded, giving his elder an affirmative grunt. Before he was pulled from the crowd, I was laser focused on selling my story, constructing answers to questions that hadn’t even been asked yet. Seeing the anguish dripping off his features broke my concentration.

He looked to be in his early twenties, about six-feet tall, with a shaved head and a half crescent nose ring connecting his nostrils. His eyes were saturated with a deep, reflective sadness, his gaze empty and distant, like he was watching a memory rather than actually seeing anything physically in front of him. The corners of his mouth were collapsed into a rigid, immovable frown, the type of vacant expression that’s left over only after you’ve already completely exhausted every other painful emotion.

My heart broke for him. Whatever familial weirdness was currently on display, with the perfect white dress code and the inappropriately cheery atmosphere, the kid seemed like he was the only one experiencing genuine grief. His dad was dead, and he looked hurt and alone.

That empathy would last about another ten minutes.

*“Horus…this woman, Tara, is claiming to have been with your father, and she’s showing up here dressed like…dressed like that. Did you know anything about this?”*

*This might be game over,* I thought to myself. *Need to come up with a way to recover.*

He pointed his empty gaze at me. For a second, his eyes remained cold. But then, like the flash of blinding white light before the explosion of an atomic bomb, his expression instantly brightened and became animated. It wasn’t recognition that had reignited Horus; it was something else.

It was an idea. I didn’t know it at the time, but Horus was a pretty damn good improvisor as well.

*“Yeah, I know her. Dad mentioned her a few times in passing. Told me that she may or may not show up today. He wasn’t sure whether she really loved him or not, but I think he told her to show up if she did really love him.”*

He paused, calculating what to say next.

*“Tara’s an outsider. Dad wasn’t sure that we’d accept her, especially after what happened with Diane.”*

Akila turned back to me, now stone-faced and deathly serious.

*“Well, Tara, is all that true? You’re here because you loved my son?”*

I didn’t have long to contemplate the strangeness that was unfolding in front me, so I acted on instinct.

Terrible call.

*“…yes! Yes, I loved Jom. That’s why I’m here.”*

Horus nearly crumbled to the ground, his immovable frown dissipating into a grin swollen with ecstasy.

*“Well…well alright then. That’s very noble of you, to come here of your own volition, espousing your love from my son. Bassel, could you escort Tara to the front? Show her where family sits? The eulogy will be starting in a few minutes.”* Akila replied.

The brawny gentleman with the tree-trunk biceps walked over, placing one massive arm forward to guide me and the other massive arm on my shoulder, as if to make sure I wasn’t going anywhere.

Behind me, I heard Horus cackling, doubling over and practically wheezing from whatever he found to be so goddamned funny.

\----------

There was a certain comedy to the way Akila had been positioned to deliver the eulogy. I couldn’t appreciate the humor of it at the time, with Bassel following me like a shadow, his looming presence causing a veritable chorus of alarm bells to ring loudly in my skull. But, in retrospect, I remember the juxtaposition of her in front of the casket being genuinely funny.

She was just so absurdly small, and the coffin was just so absurdly big. A marble torpedo behind a human earthworm, wrinkled skin flapping up and down as she spewed her ritualistic bullshit into the microphone.

*“Jom was a wonderful son, a loving father, and a devoted vicar of Khepri.”* Akila boomed, voice tinged with bursts of static from cheap speaker systems.

*“When Jom was on death’s door, we all felt his pain. In terms of renewal, he was without an ideal conduit. We all still grieve the loss of Diane, consumed by heresy, leaving him without love and Horus without a mother.”*

I turned to Bassel, pointing to my bladder and then pointing to the door. It was a lie; nature wasn’t calling. Not in that sense, at least. My subconscious was screaming, begging me to get the fuck out of that room through whatever means possible.

*Something is so fucking wrong,* I thought, waiting for Bassel to respond to my pantomiming.

He smiled, but it wasn’t reassuring. The grin was patronizing, revealing his own bitter amusement rather than his willingness to help, like he was watching his cat trying and failing to jump onto a forbidden table.

The man shook his head *no* a few times, and then placed a hand over my scalp, manually twisting my head back in the direction of Akila.

*“Little did we know, however, that in the nick of time, Jom found love. He was scared to divulge his love to us, because she is an outsider, just as Diane was. But, by being here, she has proven herself worthy of Khepri’s embrace, unlike the heretic.”* she said, gesturing a bony hand in my direction, long acrylic nails taking the shape of hawk talons.

*“Tara - we’re very grateful for your love, and your commitment to Jom. As you well know, passionate love is the best conduit. It's easier for Khepri to mold. But, of course, the love of youngest son will do if passionate love isn’t available. All that is to say, I’m sure Horus is very grateful, as well.”*

At that point, my heart was crashing against my rib cage like jackhammer, percussive and relentless. Bassel’s sturdy hand remained on my head, fixing my gaze on Akila.

Because of that, I couldn’t look away when the matriarch turned to face me, detailing what was to be my fate.

*“Your black night, desolate and bare, will draw the death from Jom, granting him renewal.”*

Sweat poured over my body, drenching me with sticky fear.

*“Are you ready, Tara?”*

Another white-clad figure appeared behind Akila, wrenching the heavy lid of the casket open.

Inside, Jom’s desiccated corpse laid flat, arms crossed over his shoulders, naked as the day he was born. But his body only covered half of the available space.

You see, the reason the coffin was so damn large is because it was built to house two separate people. The other half *had* been for Jom’s son, but now it was designated for me.

They were going to bury me alive in that marble tomb.

As if I even needed it confirmed at that point, I noted that the body had both of their hands. My actual assignment had lost one of his during their tour of Vietnam.

Hank had dropped me off on the wrong day.

When I didn’t move towards the casket, paralyzed by fear, Akila spoke into the microphone one more time, sharp static crackling through the speakers again like an electric tongue whipping invisibly through the air.

*“Bassel, it seems like Tara is having a bit of cold feet. Bring her over here, show our conduit how spacious it is inside, next to her beloved.”*

The man’s muscular paws pulled my head up, forcing me to my feet.

I tried to brainstorm even a fragment of an exit strategy, but for the second time that day, Horus broke my concentration.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ip0ck3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ip0ck3/i_had_a_career_as_a_professional_mourner_during/,"I had a career as a ""professional mourner"" during the 80s. The last assignment I ever accepted nearly got me killed. (Part 1)","*“You sure this is the right place, Hank?”* I shouted from outside the limousine.

The husky chauffeur didn’t respond, attention transfixed on his handheld television, fiddling with the antennae to minimize static. A cold October wind howled through the valley, causing the slit of my black dress to flutter against my thigh. Frustration mounted behind my eyes as I waited for an answer, glaring through the passenger’s side window while shivering from the violent squall.

Getting the sense that he was intentionally ignoring me, I pulled trembling fists from the pockets of my wool coat and improvised a drum solo against the thick glass. My knuckles were so cold that I barely felt them make contact.

The amateur rendition of Van Halen’s *“Hot For Teacher”* was enough to get his attention. A scowl curled up the side of his face. Without moving his eyes away from the blinking screen, Hank leaned over to roll down the window, his beer gut flopping awkwardly over the central console like a pillowcase half filled with maple syrup. He gave the crank two lazy twists, and the window creaked down a few inches.

*“Robin - what the fuck is the matter? It’s the goddamned World Series,”* he said, pointing at the small TV and acting like I was unaware of that fact. Hank had nearly careened off the road multiple times on the thirty-minute drive over here, seemingly unable to drag his eyes away from the game for more than a handful of seconds at a time.

I felt a myriad of insults thump against the back of my teeth, begging to be unleashed, but I swallowed my annoyance.

*“Can you please just look at the sign?”* I pleaded, gesturing to the name listed above a picture of the deceased.

*“…’85 wasn’t our year, but ‘87…’87 is for The Cardinals…”* he muttered, still glued to the feed.

*“Hank, for the love of God, confirm that I’m walking into the right funeral or I’m getting back into the car. I was told the guy’s name was ""‘John’, not ‘Jom’. The damn sign says ‘Jom’.”* I snapped.

Hank slumped his shoulders with childlike exaggeration and sighed. Reluctantly, he shoved a meaty claw into the breast pocket of his blazer, digging around for the instructions given to him by our escort agency. With a crumpled slip of paper in hand, his pupils finally detached from the game. Hastily, he scanned the name and date.

*“Looks right to me,”* he remarked. Before I could ask to see it too, he spat chewing tobacco that had been resting along his gumline into the slip. My eyes widened in disbelief as I watched Hank wrap the paper around the brown-black ichor, only to then toss the malformed lump into his coffee cup.

*“Christ, Hank. You couldn’t have just handed it to me, like a human being? Or are you not a human being? Maybe you're actually some human-shaped donkey? Does that sound right?”*

The insult finally brought his eyes to meet mine. Instead of anger, he shot me a threatening grin. A wolf’s smile, bearing hungry canines in my direction.

*“Look, doll - how about you tiptoe those fragile, porcelain feet up to the home’s concierge and ask about the service? I’ll wait here. If it ain’t right, we’ll go back to the office.”*

He expected a sheepish reply, but I sure as shit didn’t give him one, instead providing a thumbs up with my right hand and a middle finger with my left. I didn’t scare easy. Not only that, but I’ve been in the escort business long enough to know the difference between an actual predator and a small man making empty threats.

When I turned to walk up the cobblestone path that led to the funeral home, my ears became filled with the sound of Hank slamming his foot down on the accelerator, tires screeching against asphalt. Didn’t even bother to turn back around, honestly. No point.

*“Asshole.”* I murmured, securing my purse under my arm to prevent it from blowing away as I approached the opulent, repurposed plantation house.

The mansion’s white pillars loomed over me as I carefully climbed the porch steps, stilettos clacking against the refurbished wood. As I stepped toward the front door, a surge of anxiety unexpectedly sprinted up the length of my spine and planted itself at the top of my neck, crackling around the base of my skull like electricity from an exposed wire. With my heartbeat galloping in my chest, I took a deep breath and twisted the knob, not willing to let nervous energy prevent me from earning my keep.

A lot of what happened to me was out of my control, but I did one thing wrong that day. My gut was screaming for me to turn around. It implored me to sprint back down those stairs and into the street like the devil themself was close behind me, nipping at my heels.

But I ignored the feeling, contorted my face into an expression of grief, and pushed on, unknowingly putting myself into the Cult of the Scarab's crosshairs, intruding on their rite of sacred renewal.

\----------

*“Right this way, ma’am,”* said the funeral director, leading me into a familiar narrow hallway behind the lobby. Only a week earlier I’d been at this funeral home, pretending to grieve over someone else. As we walked, I reviewed the details I’d received concerning the deceased, provided to my agency by his company’s board of investors.

*Pharmaceutical CFO. Passed in his late sixties. Very private. Had two previous marriages. Right hand was mangled during his tenure in Vietnam, doesn’t bother with a prosthetic. Months before his death, rumors of him being gay cropped up in the tabloids.*

*I’m playing his secret lover. An unknown buxom paramour, weeping over the loss of their sugar daddy, dispelling the whispers of his potential homosexuality.*

People purchased my time for an assortment of different reasons. Sometimes, I was hired by the soon-to-be deceased, arriving at their memorial service just to boost the overall number of attendees visibly present and grieving. Other times, the request was more specific and it wasn’t the deceased who was hiring me.

This was one of those *other times.*

It wasn’t glamorous work, lying at some poor sap’s funeral on the behalf of someone else and their interests, but it was much preferable to the labor I performed when I was first hired. Think fishnet stockings and disagreements over the virtues of condom use.

All that said, it'd be disingenuous to say I wasn't proud of myself.

This was my niche, and despite the seediness, it was mine, and I was good at it. Considered an expert, actually. Anyone can show up and be a pretty face in the crowd; a twenty-something with running mascara and a nice ass cartoonishly *boo-hooing* into an open casket. But me? I played the assigned role with tact and nuance. I sold a narrative, and nine times out of ten, my marks bought it.

The key was you needed to be a proficient improviser.

Discretion was the name of the game in my line of work; I rarely got a lot of background information about the deceased to work with. Meant I had to be capable of thinking on my toes - bobbing and weaving through conversations like my life depended on it.

Ironically, though, if I wasn’t so damn convincing, I might not have ended up almost suffocating to death less than an hour after the funeral concluded.

\----------

I expected all the usual sounds of organized memorial would become audible as we approached the reception hall; sobbing, a pipe organ singing its quiet lamentations, hushed arguments over the division of an inheritance. Sounds most people associated with deep sorrow. To me, however, mourning sounded like work. It was ambient noise I had become so accustomed to that I barely even noticed it.

But that’s not what I heard as we drew closer to the service. Quite the opposite, actually. Joyful sounds reverberated down the hallway. As the funeral director opened the door to the reception hall, I heard laughing and the clinking of glasses. The sparkling timbre of a wedding filled my ears, not the joyless dirge of a wake.

I stepped in, and for a moment, I truly believed I was walking in on some kind of themed birthday party. Every attendee sported a pure white outfit, head to toe. The previously jubilant noise fizzled out into dead silence when they saw me enter, adorned in funerary black. I was nearly about to excuse myself back through the door when I spied a young man at the opposite end of the vast room, dressed in a black three-piece suit, leaning wearily against an enormous marble coffin.

*“Is…is this Jom’s funeral?”* I managed to sputter out into the motionless crowd.

The fifty or so funeral goers remained silent. I could tell that something about my arrival was intensely befuddling, with looks of confusion painted over the attendee’s faces. Eventually, the shrill squeaking of poorly lubricated metal wheels broke the silence. The crowd parted to reveal an elderly woman in a wheelchair pushing herself towards me. She peered from side-to-side as she approached, observing the still petrified mourners staring at me with a look of disapproval.

*“Oh, would you relax? Go back to what you were doing. I’ll figure it out. Khepri save us, y’all would be startled shitless by a ladybug if it flew at you too fast,”* she croaked. Slowly, the figures in white pulled their attention away from me, and the lively chatter resumed, albeit at a much lower volume.

With the funeral reanimated, the elderly woman brought her eyes to mine, converting her scowl into a toothy grin. A wispy white dress hung loosely from her skeletal frame, giving her the appearance of a mobility-challenged banshee. The weight of a golden broach pulled the front of her dress forward at the collarbone, revealing the outlines of her upper ribs through thin, liver spotted skin. The accessory was about the size of a golf ball, and it depicted a beetle with what looked like a lotus flower etched onto its wings.

*“And you are, dear?”* she asked, settling in front of me by using a levered brake to halt the wheelchair’s momentum.

Based on the woman’s command of the other mourners and her wizened appearance, I made an educated guess as to her identity.

*“Hi…you must be Jom’s mother?”*

She nodded, her brow furrowing and her grin melting away as her head tilted up and down. The matriarch studied me intensely, her expression now twisted into one of confusion, like those of the mourners when they first saw me.

Relief fluttered through my chest. I briefly savored the pleasurable rush that came after the anxiety of a calculated risk. Then I smiled, took a generous inhale, and continued, launching into an ad libbed speech I had given countless times before.

*""It is nice finally to meet you. I…I wish it wasn’t under these circumstances, and I wish I knew your first name, but you know how private Jom can be-”*

I paused and forced a chuckle, letting tears well up as I broke eye contact - body language that screamed “*I’m struggling to use past tense now that he's dead, oh the sweet misery”*. A sigh fell from my lips, and then I picked up where I left off.

*“…you know how private Jom* ***could*** *be. I’m Tara. Your son and I were together for the last year or so. What’s your first name, ma’am?”*

Unexpectedly, I watched her eyes widen with some mix of alarm and disbelief.

*“It’s…it’s Akila”*

Without saying anything more, she abruptly pivoted her head and torso around, scanning the room for someone. Akila seemingly couldn’t locate them in the crowd, so she just started shouting a name.

*“Horus! Hoooorus! Could someone bring my grandson over?”*

The figures closest to us leaped into action, clearly fighting to be the person that fulfilled Akila’s request. Within seconds, one of the attendees, a hulking middle-aged man with biceps like tree trunks, returned with the kid in the black suit that had been previously leaning against the coffin, practically dragging the miserable looking young man by the wrist to his grandmother.

*“Ah! There you are, Horus.”* Akila cooed.

The boy barely responded, giving his elder an affirmative grunt. Before he was pulled from the crowd, I was laser focused on selling my story, constructing answers to questions that hadn’t even been asked yet. Seeing the anguish dripping off his features broke my concentration.

He looked to be in his early twenties, about six-feet tall, with a shaved head and a half crescent nose ring connecting his nostrils. His eyes were saturated with a deep, reflective sadness, his gaze empty and distant, like he was watching a memory rather than actually seeing anything physically in front of him. The corners of his mouth were collapsed into a rigid, immovable frown, the type of vacant expression that’s left over only after you’ve already completely exhausted every other painful emotion.

My heart broke for him. Whatever familial weirdness was currently on display, with the perfect white dress code and the inappropriately cheery atmosphere, the kid seemed like he was the only one experiencing genuine grief. His dad was dead, and he looked hurt and alone.

That empathy would last about another ten minutes.

*“Horus…this woman, Tara, is claiming to have been with your father, and she’s showing up here dressed like…dressed like that. Did you know anything about this?”*

*This might be game over,* I thought to myself. *Need to come up with a way to recover.*

He pointed his empty gaze at me. For a second, his eyes remained cold. But then, like the flash of blinding white light before the explosion of an atomic bomb, his expression instantly brightened and became animated. It wasn’t recognition that had reignited Horus; it was something else.

It was an idea. I didn’t know it at the time, but Horus was a pretty damn good improvisor as well.

*“Yeah, I know her. Dad mentioned her a few times in passing. Told me that she may or may not show up today. He wasn’t sure whether she really loved him or not, but I think he told her to show up if she did really love him.”*

He paused, calculating what to say next.

*“Tara’s an outsider. Dad wasn’t sure that we’d accept her, especially after what happened with Diane.”*

Akila turned back to me, now stone-faced and deathly serious.

*“Well, Tara, is all that true? You’re here because you loved my son?”*

I didn’t have long to contemplate the strangeness that was unfolding in front me, so I acted on instinct.

Terrible call.

*“…yes! Yes, I loved Jom. That’s why I’m here.”*

Horus nearly crumbled to the ground, his immovable frown dissipating into a grin swollen with ecstasy.

*“Well…well alright then. That’s very noble of you, to come here of your own volition, espousing your love from my son. Bassel, could you escort Tara to the front? Show her where family sits? The eulogy will be starting in a few minutes.”* Akila replied.

The brawny gentleman with the tree-trunk biceps walked over, placing one massive arm forward to guide me and the other massive arm on my shoulder, as if to make sure I wasn’t going anywhere.

Behind me, I heard Horus cackling, doubling over and practically wheezing from whatever he found to be so goddamned funny.

\----------

There was a certain comedy to the way Akila had been positioned to deliver the eulogy. I couldn’t appreciate the humor of it at the time, with Bassel following me like a shadow, his looming presence causing a veritable chorus of alarm bells to ring loudly in my skull. But, in retrospect, I remember the juxtaposition of her in front of the casket being genuinely funny.

She was just so absurdly small, and the coffin was just so absurdly big. A marble torpedo behind a human earthworm, wrinkled skin flapping up and down as she spewed her ritualistic bullshit into the microphone.

*“Jom was a wonderful son, a loving father, and a devoted vicar of Khepri.”* Akila boomed, voice tinged with bursts of static from cheap speaker systems.

*“When Jom was on death’s door, we all felt his pain. In terms of renewal, he was without an ideal conduit. We all still grieve the loss of Diane, consumed by heresy, leaving him without love and Horus without a mother.”*

I turned to Bassel, pointing to my bladder and then pointing to the door. It was a lie; nature wasn’t calling. Not in that sense, at least. My subconscious was screaming, begging me to get the fuck out of that room through whatever means possible.

*Something is so fucking wrong,* I thought, waiting for Bassel to respond to my pantomiming.

He smiled, but it wasn’t reassuring. The grin was patronizing, revealing his own bitter amusement rather than his willingness to help, like he was watching his cat trying and failing to jump onto a forbidden table.

The man shook his head *no* a few times, and then placed a hand over my scalp, manually twisting my head back in the direction of Akila.

*“Little did we know, however, that in the nick of time, Jom found love. He was scared to divulge his love to us, because she is an outsider, just as Diane was. But, by being here, she has proven herself worthy of Khepri’s embrace, unlike the heretic.”* she said, gesturing a bony hand in my direction, long acrylic nails taking the shape of hawk talons.

*“Tara - we’re very grateful for your love, and your commitment to Jom. As you well know, passionate love is the best conduit. It's easier for Khepri to mold. But, of course, the love of youngest son will do if passionate love isn’t available. All that is to say, I’m sure Horus is very grateful, as well.”*

At that point, my heart was crashing against my rib cage like jackhammer, percussive and relentless. Bassel’s sturdy hand remained on my head, fixing my gaze on Akila.

Because of that, I couldn’t look away when the matriarch turned to face me, detailing what was to be my fate.

*“Your black night, desolate and bare, will draw the death from Jom, granting him renewal.”*

Sweat poured over my body, drenching me with sticky fear.

*“Are you ready, Tara?”*

Another white-clad figure appeared behind Akila, wrenching the heavy lid of the casket open.

Inside, Jom’s desiccated corpse laid flat, arms crossed over his shoulders, naked as the day he was born. But his body only covered half of the available space.

You see, the reason the coffin was so damn large is because it was built to house two separate people. The other half *had* been for Jom’s son, but now it was designated for me.

They were going to bury me alive in that marble tomb.

As if I even needed it confirmed at that point, I noted that the body had both of their hands. My actual assignment had lost one of his during their tour of Vietnam.

Hank had dropped me off on the wrong day.

When I didn’t move towards the casket, paralyzed by fear, Akila spoke into the microphone one more time, sharp static crackling through the speakers again like an electric tongue whipping invisibly through the air.

*“Bassel, it seems like Tara is having a bit of cold feet. Bring her over here, show our conduit how spacious it is inside, next to her beloved.”*

The man’s muscular paws pulled my head up, forcing me to my feet.

I tried to brainstorm even a fragment of an exit strategy, but for the second time that day, Horus broke my concentration.

Somewhere in the back of the room, I heard him snickering under his breath, downright elated with his unbelievably good fortune.

FTR, I have only ever used a lelit anna before and loved it, but Im not a connoisseur ... mostly just want to make a nice latte every morning with good coffee and silky foam whole milk, and I like the ceremony of making it manually (vs one of those fully automatic machines).... Im not sure I'd be trying to dial in the exact perfect shot each time as Id likely never drink it straight, and would 99/100 times opt for a latte.

Okay, so this time around I prepared myself. Full shelf of miralax, stool softeners, fleet enema (should an urgent situation arise again), you name it. I took a few a day prior to my ER and felt okay. Totally cool. This morning I woke up and again felt fine. The nurse hooks up my IV and immediately I feel my stomach make a small gurgle… I figured I’m hungry? Fasting overnight and no morning coffee so makes sense, right? Five minutes later I feel a little bubbly, but nothing terrible. Maybe gas? I can hold it for a bit, no problem! Cool. Nurse comes in to take me into the OR and now I’m spread eagle, bare behind, ass cheeks and hoohaw open wide apart for the nurse, OR tech, embryologist, surgeon, and anesthesiologist to get started. Before I know it I’m waking up in the recovery area. Totally forgot about my potential back-end problems. Happy to be awake and merrily drinking my juice. Before I leave, I get up from the PACU bed to change clothes and get my bag and what do I see????? Shit stains down the sheets!!! Because how tf could that have come out of me when I feel totally fine, I go and take a closer look at it and get a whiff. OMFG it’s shit!!! I think I died of humiliation. The good people there never said a word to me but I am 100% sure I must have nuked that OR and taken no prisoners. I’m so sorry, to my fertility clinic. I feel absolutely terrible. You can add a toxic waste and exposure fee to my tab, as well as a laundering and cleaning fee. And I pray for anyone affected. My husband laughed at me when I told him what happened but I am mortified to show my poopy face back there. Alas, I may die from shame before ever having a viable embryo.

Reluctantly, he shoved a meaty claw into the breast pocket of his blazer, digging around for the instructions given to him by our escort agency. With a crumpled slip of paper in hand, his pupils finally detached from the game. Hastily, he scanned the name and date.

*“Looks right to me,”* he remarked. Before I could ask to see it too, he spat chewing tobacco that had been resting along his gumline into the slip. My eyes widened in disbelief as I watched Hank wrap the paper around the brown-black ichor, only to then toss the malformed lump into his coffee cup.

*“Christ, Hank. You couldn’t have just handed it to me, like a human being? Or are you not a human being? Maybe you're actually some human-shaped donkey? Does that sound right?”*

The insult finally brought his eyes to meet mine. Instead of anger, he shot me a threatening grin. A wolf’s smile, bearing hungry canines in my direction.

*“Look, doll - how about you tiptoe those fragile, porcelain feet up to the home’s concierge and ask about the service? I’ll wait here. If it ain’t right, we’ll go back to the office.”*

He expected a sheepish reply, but I sure as shit didn’t give him one, instead providing a thumbs up with my right hand and a middle finger with my left. I didn’t scare easy. Not only that, but I’ve been in the escort business long enough to know the difference between an actual predator and a small man making empty threats.

When I turned to walk up the cobblestone path that led to the funeral home, my ears became filled with the sound of Hank slamming his foot down on the accelerator, tires screeching against asphalt. Didn’t even bother to turn back around, honestly. No point.

*“Asshole.”* I murmured, securing my purse under my arm to prevent it from blowing away as I approached the opulent, repurposed plantation house.

The mansion’s white pillars loomed over me as I carefully climbed the porch steps, stilettos clacking against the refurbished wood. As I stepped toward the front door, a surge of anxiety unexpectedly sprinted up the length of my spine and planted itself at the top of my neck, crackling around the base of my skull like electricity from an exposed wire. With my heartbeat galloping in my chest, I took a deep breath and twisted the knob, not willing to let nervous energy prevent me from earning my keep.

A lot of what happened to me was out of my control, but I did one thing wrong that day. My gut was screaming for me to turn around. It implored me to sprint back down those stairs and into the street like the devil themself was close behind me, nipping at my heels.

But I ignored the feeling, contorted my face into an expression of grief, and pushed on, unknowingly putting myself into the Cult of the Scarab's crosshairs, intruding on their rite of sacred renewal.

\----------

*“Right this way, ma’am,”* said the funeral director, leading me into a familiar narrow hallway behind the lobby. Only a week earlier I’d been at this funeral home, pretending to grieve over someone else. As we walked, I reviewed the details I’d received concerning the deceased, provided to my agency by his company’s board of investors.

*Pharmaceutical CFO. Passed in his late sixties. Very private. Had two previous marriages. Right hand was mangled during his tenure in Vietnam, doesn’t bother with a prosthetic. Months before his death, rumors of him being gay cropped up in the tabloids.*

*I’m playing his secret lover. An unknown buxom paramour, weeping over the loss of their sugar daddy, dispelling the whispers of his potential homosexuality.*

People purchased my time for an assortment of different reasons. Sometimes, I was hired by the soon-to-be deceased, arriving at their memorial service just to boost the overall number of attendees visibly present and grieving. Other times, the request was more specific and it wasn’t the deceased who was hiring me.

This was one of those *other times.*

It wasn’t glamorous work, lying at some poor sap’s funeral on the behalf of someone else and their interests, but it was much preferable to the labor I performed when I was first hired. Think fishnet stockings and disagreements over the virtues of condom use.

All that said, it'd be disingenuous to say I wasn't proud of myself.

This was my niche, and despite the seediness, it was mine, and I was good at it. Considered an expert, actually. Anyone can show up and be a pretty face in the crowd; a twenty-something with running mascara and a nice ass cartoonishly *boo-hooing* into an open casket. But me? I played the assigned role with tact and nuance. I sold a narrative, and nine times out of ten, my marks bought it.

The key was you needed to be a proficient improviser.

Discretion was the name of the game in my line of work; I rarely got a lot of background information about the deceased to work with. Meant I had to be capable of thinking on my toes - bobbing and weaving through conversations like my life depended on it.

Ironically, though, if I wasn’t so damn convincing, I might not have ended up almost suffocating to death less than an hour after the funeral concluded.

\----------

I expected all the usual sounds of organized memorial would become audible as we approached the reception hall; sobbing, a pipe organ singing its quiet lamentations, hushed arguments over the division of an inheritance. Sounds most people associated with deep sorrow. To me, however, mourning sounded like work. It was ambient noise I had become so accustomed to that I barely even noticed it.

But that’s not what I heard as we drew closer to the service. Quite the opposite, actually. Joyful sounds reverberated down the hallway. As the funeral director opened the door to the reception hall, I heard laughing and the clinking of glasses. The sparkling timbre of a wedding filled my ears, not the joyless dirge of a wake.

I stepped in, and for a moment, I truly believed I was walking in on some kind of themed birthday party. Every attendee sported a pure white outfit, head to toe. The previously jubilant noise fizzled out into dead silence when they saw me enter, adorned in funerary black. I was nearly about to excuse myself back through the door when I spied a young man at the opposite end of the vast room, dressed in a black three-piece suit, leaning wearily against an enormous marble coffin.

*“Is…is this Jom’s funeral?”* I managed to sputter out into the motionless crowd.

The fifty or so funeral goers remained silent. I could tell that something about my arrival was intensely befuddling, with looks of confusion painted over the attendee’s faces. Eventually, the shrill squeaking of poorly lubricated metal wheels broke the silence. The crowd parted to reveal an elderly woman in a wheelchair pushing herself towards me. She peered from side-to-side as she approached, observing the still petrified mourners staring at me with a look of disapproval.

*“Oh, would you relax? Go back to what you were doing. I’ll figure it out. Khepri save us, y’all would be startled shitless by a ladybug if it flew at you too fast,”* she croaked. Slowly, the figures in white pulled their attention away from me, and the lively chatter resumed, albeit at a much lower volume.

With the funeral reanimated, the elderly woman brought her eyes to mine, converting her scowl into a toothy grin. A wispy white dress hung loosely from her skeletal frame, giving her the appearance of a mobility-challenged banshee. The weight of a golden broach pulled the front of her dress forward at the collarbone, revealing the outlines of her upper ribs through thin, liver spotted skin. The accessory was about the size of a golf ball, and it depicted a beetle with what looked like a lotus flower etched onto its wings.

*“And you are, dear?”* she asked, settling in front of me by using a levered brake to halt the wheelchair’s momentum.

Based on the woman’s command of the other mourners and her wizened appearance, I made an educated guess as to her identity.

*“Hi…you must be Jom’s mother?”*

She nodded, her brow furrowing and her grin melting away as her head tilted up and down. The matriarch studied me intensely, her expression now twisted into one of confusion, like those of the mourners when they first saw me.

Relief fluttered through my chest. I briefly savored the pleasurable rush that came after the anxiety of a calculated risk. Then I smiled, took a generous inhale, and continued, launching into an ad libbed speech I had given countless times before.

*""It is nice finally to meet you. I…I wish it wasn’t under these circumstances, and I wish I knew your first name, but you know how private Jom can be-”*

I paused and forced a chuckle, letting tears well up as I broke eye contact - body language that screamed “*I’m struggling to use past tense now that he's dead, oh the sweet misery”*. A sigh fell from my lips, and then I picked up where I left off.

*“…you know how private Jom* ***could*** *be. I’m Tara. Your son and I were together for the last year or so. What’s your first name, ma’am?”*

Unexpectedly, I watched her eyes widen with some mix of alarm and disbelief.

*“It’s…it’s Akila”*

Without saying anything more, she abruptly pivoted her head and torso around, scanning the room for someone. Akila seemingly couldn’t locate them in the crowd, so she just started shouting a name.

*“Horus! Hoooorus! Could someone bring my grandson over?”*

The figures closest to us leaped into action, clearly fighting to be the person that fulfilled Akila’s request. Within seconds, one of the attendees, a hulking middle-aged man with biceps like tree trunks, returned with the kid in the black suit that had been previously leaning against the coffin, practically dragging the miserable looking young man by the wrist to his grandmother.

*“Ah! There you are, Horus.”* Akila cooed.

The boy barely responded, giving his elder an affirmative grunt. Before he was pulled from the crowd, I was laser focused on selling my story, constructing answers to questions that hadn’t even been asked yet. Seeing the anguish dripping off his features broke my concentration.

He looked to be in his early twenties, about six-feet tall, with a shaved head and a half crescent nose ring connecting his nostrils. His eyes were saturated with a deep, reflective sadness, his gaze empty and distant, like he was watching a memory rather than actually seeing anything physically in front of him. The corners of his mouth were collapsed into a rigid, immovable frown, the type of vacant expression that’s left over only after you’ve already completely exhausted every other painful emotion.

My heart broke for him. Whatever familial weirdness was currently on display, with the perfect white dress code and the inappropriately cheery atmosphere, the kid seemed like he was the only one experiencing genuine grief. His dad was dead, and he looked hurt and alone.

That empathy would last about another ten minutes.

*“Horus…this woman, Tara, is claiming to have been with your father, and she’s showing up here dressed like…dressed like that. Did you know anything about this?”*

*This might be game over,* I thought to myself. *Need to come up with a way to recover.*

He pointed his empty gaze at me. For a second, his eyes remained cold. But then, like the flash of blinding white light before the explosion of an atomic bomb, his expression instantly brightened and became animated. It wasn’t recognition that had reignited Horus; it was something else.

It was an idea. I didn’t know it at the time, but Horus was a pretty damn good improvisor as well.

*“Yeah, I know her. Dad mentioned her a few times in passing. Told me that she may or may not show up today. He wasn’t sure whether she really loved him or not, but I think he told her to show up if she did really love him.”*

He paused, calculating what to say next.

*“Tara’s an outsider. Dad wasn’t sure that we’d accept her, especially after what happened with Diane.”*

Akila turned back to me, now stone-faced and deathly serious.

*“Well, Tara, is all that true? You’re here because you loved my son?”*

I didn’t have long to contemplate the strangeness that was unfolding in front me, so I acted on instinct.

Terrible call.

*“…yes! Yes, I loved Jom. That’s why I’m here.”*

Horus nearly crumbled to the ground, his immovable frown dissipating into a grin swollen with ecstasy.

*“Well…well alright then. That’s very noble of you, to come here of your own volition, espousing your love from my son. Bassel, could you escort Tara to the front? Show her where family sits? The eulogy will be starting in a few minutes.”* Akila replied.

The brawny gentleman with the tree-trunk biceps walked over, placing one massive arm forward to guide me and the other massive arm on my shoulder, as if to make sure I wasn’t going anywhere.

Behind me, I heard Horus cackling, doubling over and practically wheezing from whatever he found to be so goddamned funny.

\----------

There was a certain comedy to the way Akila had been positioned to deliver the eulogy. I couldn’t appreciate the humor of it at the time, with Bassel following me like a shadow, his looming presence causing a veritable chorus of alarm bells to ring loudly in my skull. But, in retrospect, I remember the juxtaposition of her in front of the casket being genuinely funny.

She was just so absurdly small, and the coffin was just so absurdly big. A marble torpedo behind a human earthworm, wrinkled skin flapping up and down as she spewed her ritualistic bullshit into the microphone.

*“Jom was a wonderful son, a loving father, and a devoted vicar of Khepri.”* Akila boomed, voice tinged with bursts of static from cheap speaker systems.

*“When Jom was on death’s door, we all felt his pain. In terms of renewal, he was without an ideal conduit. We all still grieve the loss of Diane, consumed by heresy, leaving him without love and Horus without a mother.”*

I turned to Bassel, pointing to my bladder and then pointing to the door. It was a lie; nature wasn’t calling. Not in that sense, at least. My subconscious was screaming, begging me to get the fuck out of that room through whatever means possible.

*Something is so fucking wrong,* I thought, waiting for Bassel to respond to my pantomiming.

He smiled, but it wasn’t reassuring. The grin was patronizing, revealing his own bitter amusement rather than his willingness to help, like he was watching his cat trying and failing to jump onto a forbidden table.

The man shook his head *no* a few times, and then placed a hand over my scalp, manually twisting my head back in the direction of Akila.

*“Little did we know, however, that in the nick of time, Jom found love. He was scared to divulge his love to us, because she is an outsider, just as Diane was. But, by being here, she has proven herself worthy of Khepri’s embrace, unlike the heretic.”* she said, gesturing a bony hand in my direction, long acrylic nails taking the shape of hawk talons.

*“Tara - we’re very grateful for your love, and your commitment to Jom. As you well know, passionate love is the best conduit. It's easier for Khepri to mold. But, of course, the love of youngest son will do if passionate love isn’t available. All that is to say, I’m sure Horus is very grateful, as well.”*

At that point, my heart was crashing against my rib cage like jackhammer, percussive and relentless. Bassel’s sturdy hand remained on my head, fixing my gaze on Akila.

Because of that, I couldn’t look away when the matriarch turned to face me, detailing what was to be my fate.

*“Your black night, desolate and bare, will draw the death from Jom, granting him renewal.”*

Sweat poured over my body, drenching me with sticky fear.

*“Are you ready, Tara?”*

Another white-clad figure appeared behind Akila, wrenching the heavy lid of the casket open.

Inside, Jom’s desiccated corpse laid flat, arms crossed over his shoulders, naked as the day he was born. But his body only covered half of the available space.

You see, the reason the coffin was so damn large is because it was built to house two separate people. The other half *had* been for Jom’s son, but now it was designated for me.

They were going to bury me alive in that marble tomb. 

As if I even needed it confirmed at that point, I noted that the body had both of their hands. My actual assignment had lost one of his during their tour of Vietnam.

Hank had dropped me off on the wrong day.

When I didn’t move towards the casket, paralyzed by fear, Akila spoke into the microphone one more time, sharp static crackling through the speakers again like an electric tongue whipping invisibly through the air.

*“Bassel, it seems like Tara is having a bit of cold feet. Bring her over here, show our conduit how spacious it is inside, next to her beloved.”*

The man’s muscular paw pulled my head up, forcing me to my feet.

I tried to brainstorm even a fragment of an exit strategy, but for the second time that day, Horus broke my concentration.

Somewhere in the back of the room, I heard him snickering under his breath, downright elated with his unbelievably good fortune.

I wouldn’t let him distract me again after that.",2,1739500097.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

Follow that up with her stealing his motorcycle and then kissing him after I think that’s when she realized she was into him more than into him she loved him. We know that that’s when Marcus realized he loved Ginny  was after she kissed him. I think that’s why honestly she had sex with them. She heard him say that he couldn’t stop thinking about her and she was interested in him and we know he was in love with her so bam. 

And honestly, the only reason why Jenny was ever with Hunter was because of Maxine it had everything to do with Maxine and I had everything to do with the fact that she just didn’t wanna piss off her friends by not going after what she really wanted, which was Marcus he never wanted Hunter. He never loved Hunter and maybe she did love Hunter, but I don’t think her love for Hunter with anything obviously Anywhere near as her love for Marcus again my theory is still stand. She wanted Marcus from the start in, Maxine didn’t help make that possible because she set her up with Hunter so quickly.

Also unrelated to this but a different theory what do you think would’ve happened if Georgia got arrested after the first season instead of after the second season? what if the PI arrested her because of Kenny and he went to the coffee shop telling Ginny  that not only did her mom tell Kenny , but that he  was going. He was going to arrest her for it . Would’ve made season two look different. And season 3 idk what that would be about if it was flopped like that. 🤷🏻‍♀️",1,1739500037.0,ginnyandgeorgiashow,0,1.0,False

1ip08hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1ip08hh/tylenol_to_cocaine_speed_run/,Tylenol to cocaine speed run,"I’ve always seen myself as a good and moral person. But after a really tough breakup of a relationship that lasted a year, with a boy I wanted to marry, I started being reckless. 

First I started drinking but it really impaired my ability to go to school and engage with family so I stopped. I didn’t really like it.

Then I tried a friends vape and holy cow it felt amazing. Dizzy in the good way, energized, excited. But it felt too “normal” since everyone was vaping so I smoked a cigarette and threw up. I gave up on nicotine for a while after that but I don’t refuse a hit or two off a vape when I’m offered. 

Then I started working out which felt good but after an intense workout my legs really hurt. So I went to grab some Tylenol in my medicine cabinet and found a bottle of combined Tylenol, caffeine, and codiene (an opioid). I took 3 since it was the max the Internet recommended, and had the best evening ever. The pain was replaced with so much pleasure all over my body. I certainly wasn’t “high” but I felt fucking good. I felt so happy and excited like nicotine but much better. When it wore off I felt like I had achieved the right amount of reckless and wanted to stop there before I fucked up my life. I didn’t wanna become an addict of course.

But then later on I got a sick idea. There were a few perscription bottles in the medicine cabinet that I saw when I was looking for Tylenol. Any prescription pill that wasn’t taken daily must be a pain med right? 

I found a bunch of weird named drugs but when I googled them I found their “brand” names and recognized them as Xanax, Ativan, Percocet, and hydrocodone. There were a few others but google said they wouldn’t make me feel good so I ignored them. 

I knew I was going to play it safe. I knew what drug addiction was, and what it does to people. So I just wanted to try each one once and then never again. I was so determined to not become addicted I made a list of reasons and a big one was “mom will notice the pills missing.” 

I tried Ativan first because it was the “easiest” drug according to the internet. It didn’t feel like much beyond relaxation, and I got a good sleep. 

So the next day I tried Xanax and that was amazing. It felt like I was back on the cruise ship in the Caribbean and life was so good and calm. There wasn’t any pleasure like those special Tylenols with codiene, but I was really chill and that made me happy. 

Then I tried the hydrocodone at school so I could feel like the euphoria show. That was the best day of my entire life. I had an energy that was foreign to me. It wasn’t sharp like caffeine or nicotine, it felt natural like it was caused by all the excitement I was feeling. I felt like I was in love. I felt like I won the lottery. It was my best day ever. I was a combination of relaxed and energized. I was relaxed enough to ignore all my worries, but energized enough to be the most bubbly person in all my classes. I was the best version of myself and I felt like everyone loved me. 

But the Percocet, oh boy. For those who don’t know, Percocet is a combination of Tylenol and oxycodone. It felt even better than they make Oxy sound in movies. I wasn’t energized, but I wasn’t sleepy, I was just in pure relaxed bliss. I laid on my bed and let the waves of warm joy roll over me. I could feel the sensations in strange ways, like they were waves. One moment I’d feel like I was orgasming, and the next I’d worry it was over, then I’d feel amazing again, repeat. I preferred the hydrocodone because of the energy and environment, but this Percocet/oxy was definitely the best feeling ever if we’re comparing just sensations. 

But then when I was done I felt strange. I did everything I wanted to, and I was ready to stop forever, but I felt like I had uncovered magic and didn’t want to get rid of it. How could I ever feel that good again? Would I ever feel that good again? 

I was still in the right mind to know I didn’t want to be an addict and had to stop, so I was able to put them away and go a week without them. That week though, ough. I felt the heartbreak extra strong and craved the recklessness of drugs. I didn’t have any withdrawls from trying them once, but I still craved the way it made me feel like I still had my ex boyfriend. It filled me up with the warm love and comfort that he stole from me. Or maybe that’s just what I told myself. Maybe I just liked the idea of drugs and addiction because it made me feel “bad” and I wanted to feel bad and I wanted everyone to know I was hurting. I think it was both. 

So a week after I put the drugs away I had a migraine from dehydration. I get them time to time. Not normally a big deal. Typically a medicine called “Excedrin migraine” gets rid of them nicely. But I reached for the Tylenols with codiene that I took for my legs before. It was soooooo relieving. It was like an extra weight was taken off of me that I didn’t know existed. I was happy to be feeling the stuff I believed I never would feel again. But I kept having this thought that it’s not enough because it’s not as good as that day on the hydrocodone at school. I tried to silence those thoughts. 


The thoughts became way more obsessive after this. I began looking for “safe” drugs that aren’t addictive. I tried shrooms, and had a baaaad trip. I tried microdosing but it made me feel very uncomfortable and anxious because of the way it raised my heart. I wanted my heart to slow down like on the painkillers. So I tried weed the day after shrooms and fuck that made my heart go so high I called an ambulance. But then they gave me Xanax and I felt good again and cried because this all just made the cravings so bad. I couldn’t find anything better than painkillers. I couldn’t find anything that filled the hole in my heart from trying them. 

I didn’t understand how trying them each once could do this because that’s not how addiction works. There was something else, something wrong with my brain. I guess a part of me had romanticized drugs so much before I started that it set me up for failure. 

But I pushed through it because I wanted to stay strong. I started vaping nicotine again to satisfy some of it. It definitely didn’t get rid of all cravings but it satisfied some. 

2 more weeks go by. I’m slowly becoming more normal. I’m talking to new friends and starting to get over the guy that I loved. 

But then I get invited to a late night hangout with these friends where there is going to be weed. I don’t plan on doing any weed because of my previous panic attack with it. But when i show up there’s some sketchy “drug dealer” guys that are talking about pills. A part of me gets excited, despite me not wanting to do more drugs. I felt like I genuinely could not control myself as the question “Can I buy some?” fell out of my mouth. 

I bought a bag of 5 Oxy pills. They had another name which just indicated they were quick release, I can’t remember what it was. He said since I’m new I can take half so I basically had 10 pills. Within half an hour, after taking half a pill, it hit. It felt like my body melted and I sorta fell asleep. I went into this heaven world in my brain full of pure joy and wasn’t able to see the rest of the world. The dosage was much more than the stuff I found in the medicine cabinet and it really knocked me out. 

The next day I woke up and chatted about it. They suggested I take a much smaller dose and that a “microdose” will feel energizing the way I want. So he split the pill in 16 pieces and I took 1. This felt a lot like the hydrocodone I took at school and energized me. I realized I now had 35 more doses since I’m taking such low doses. 

I knew deep down this was wrong. I wasn’t stupid. You’re probably reading this thinking I am stupid and that you could’ve had a different reaction. But I wasn’t in control of myself, drugs change you. My desires and emotions possessed me over logic. So I started taking my doses daily. 

Very quickly, I started needing more and more. I finished in 2 weeks and needed more. I was doing so well though. Nobody noticed me being high since I was taking lower doses. They just noticed that I was happier, I was calmer, and I was doing better in school. I was full functional drug addict. 

I messaged my dealer when I ran out but he made me wait another day to see him. I was a mess. I was so irritated and angry and my stomach had a sickening feeling. Nothing like the heroin withdrawls you hear about, but still awful. When he saw me, he was worried and told me to cycle my drugs rather than taking the same ones straight. I told him I just wanted the oxy, but he insisted I try something else to take a break. I was so ready for any relief I snorted what he told me to. It was cocaine. 

The first half hour after snorting it I felt like a happy panic attack. My heart was going so fast, and I was so panicked, but I was also too happy to hate it. Then the next hour I was just happy and energized like I had some good cups of coffee. 

I knew cocaine was bad and extreme and I didn’t take it because it was “edgy” like I wanted. I took it because I needed relief from that sick feeling. But it didn’t work. I still felt that sick in my stomach. 

He felt bad for me, so he gave me the extended oxy that lasts longer for some reason and hits less intensely. I didn’t like the idea at first but I am liking how I’m having less withdrawls with this one.

My husband and I started Driftaway Coffee, our Brooklyn-based roastery, in 2014. For the past 10 years, we’ve focused on roasting and shipping coffee directly to customers, with a mission of building an equitable coffee value chain—sourcing from smallholder farmers, prioritizing women and minority producers, and making coffee more accessible and fun for everyone.

Our roastery is right across from Brooklyn Steel, at the border of Greenpoint and East Williamsburg (11222). After a decade as an online business, we’ve transformed the front of our roastery into a tasting room and coffee shop—a space designed to slow things down and explore coffee in a more interactive and intentional way.

We’ve got a pour-over bar with tasting flights and single-origin pour-overs, plus an espresso bar. If you’re into coffee (or just curious!), we’d love for you to stop by.

To celebrate, we’re offering a free drip coffee this weekend Feb 15-16 for first-time customers—just show this Reddit post!

This story was originally written in November 2004 



The birds twittered and tweeted. The lilacs were in full bloom and the air smelled of spring. The roosters chased the hens and the hens fled, but only out of coyness and modesty. The hens had seen spring before and knew their jobs well. The rooster danced this dance yearly and he too knew all of the steps. There would be baby chicks peeping soon. 



In the green pasture the cattle were restless. The steers acted hostile and possessive, as if their bodies were somehow unaware of the missing equipment. The cows, steers, and calves fled, chased, and bantered, although they all knew that all new calves on this farm came from a trailer. 



Man sat on the porch which had become his custom and waited for the trucks, trailers, and neighbors to arrive and gather up all of the stock. 



By the time that the sun, and dust had settled, the only remaining creatures on the farm were the man and the black dog. 



The man sat and rocked listlessly on the porch swing and the dog sat at his feet and waited. 



Waiting was what the dog did more than anything and he was willing to wait as long as it took. In the very core of his brain he knew that he and his ancestors had been waiting on, and for man, since they had shared caves, and he wouldn’t have changed it for anything. 



“When the frost comes again and the leaves turn to gold and red perhaps I will have learned to breathe again without wanting to cry,” the old man mumbled as he absently scratched the head of the black lab and retreated into the house. 



The dog lay down again to wait; occasionally his waiting would be interrupted by the need to drink, or eat, or go to the yard to do his business, but for the most part he waited, and as he waited he thought in the abstract way that dogs do. 



His human was called different names by different people but to the black dog he was simply ‘man’. 



The dog was black in color and his name was a simple one. He was called ’dog’ or ’black dog’, when a longer name was required. 



The man and dog had both been smirked at when his name was called, especially if they were in town. Both of them knew it and neither of them really cared. The man didn’t care much for town, or town people, so the dog didn’t either. 



The dog and the man had been together forever as far as the dog measured time, and their lives had been filled with work and companionship. These are really the only things required for a man or dog to be happy as far as the dog was concerned, and as far as he could see they always had been. 

Then things had changed. 



The change had happened when the woman was taken away in the white van with all of the lights. The lights had been flashing red and blue into the night, and the van made the most awful noise. The dog had tried to protect his home from the lights and wailing, he had been prepared to bite the men in the funny clothes and would have if the man had not shouted at him. The man had glared at him and yelled “dog no !!” So the dog had sit still and only growled as the men carried the woman off. The dog was pleased to see the van leave, and very sad when the man had left to and he had been told to “stay”. The next day the man had returned, without the woman or the van. 



The dog and the woman had never been particularly close. The dog did not like or dislike her, any more than he liked or disliked any other creature that he shared the farm with. His loyalty however, lay with the man because that was who he belonged to. 



The dog was familiar with the woman because she would sometimes refill his water dish, or if it were very very cold, or rainy, she would sometimes call him into the mud-porch and allow him to sleep there on an old pair of the man’s coveralls, until the next morning when he and the man would go off to work. 



When the man would come they would finally get to do the things the dog had been waiting for all along. They would gather eggs, they would feed the cattle, sometimes they would go to the fields and the man would plow, while the dog lay on the floor-board of the tractor. The best times were when they would go somewhere. The back of the truck was a paradise for the dog. He would stand in the center of the flat bed truck with his nose held high, smells coming faster than he would ever have imagined, eyes watering as the wind and grit blew into them but oblivious to anything other than his nose. Just to think of it even now caused the dog to twitch in his sleep. 



Sometimes they had moved cattle from place to place and the dog had helped the man by keeping them all together without causing them to become frightened and panicked. The dog could smell the fear on them and always kept them moving without scaring them too bad. The dog had learned that he could only chase the cattle when the man said, although when he had been a pup he had sometimes chased them just for fun. 



But now things were different. 



All of the animals were gone. A stranger plowed the fields. The gate had been left open in the fields. The grass grew tall and unkempt, and the paint that has always been shiny and new was now beginning to crack and peel. 



The dog had no understanding of what had happened to bring on all of the changes. For many passings of the sun after the van and the woman had left the farm had been visited by many friends and neighbors. Black dog felt like he had done a good job dealing with the people. He had not bitten any of them, and had only growled at some of them. He was a smart dog, he could tell that the man didn’t want them there but the man had let him know with a look that he wouldn’t be allowed to chase any of them off. Late at night after all of the people had gone home the man had told him that it would only be a matter of time until they stopped coming. The man had been right because the moon had changed and changed again and no one had come. 



The dog and the man didn’t go anywhere any more. The truck now sat at a crazy angle because one of it’s tires was flat. The man didn’t care so neither did the dog. Together, the man and the dog sat on the porch and waited. The man waited for the pain to stop and the dog waited for the man.

 

Every day the man would feed him, and fill his water dish, and then he would sit on the porch and swing back and forth. Often the man would drink something that smelled like rotten grapes. The dog wrinkled his nose at the smell and waited. 



Time passed as it always did and it was measured as only a dog can measure it. The shadows raced along the ground and morning would turn to noon, noon would march into afternoon, and then surrender to evening. Night would hold court and then be chased away by morning again.

 

The dog waited for the man to heal from whatever had wounded him. He could not imagine what it might be as the man didn’t limp or smell like fever or infection. A dog can tell a lot about his person when they lick them. When black dog licked his human he smelt a little soap, some hamburger helper and a sadness. He could also smell something else. The something was like desperation but worse, as if he were stuck in a trap and couldn’t get out. Black dog could not place it. He couldn’t understand it. But he didn’t like it. He didn’t like it at all. 



Black dog knew about being wounded, and he knew that somehow his man had been. 



Once when he was a puppy he had been hit by a car. He had hurt all over. He had drug himself under the porch and that is where he had stayed. After about three days hunger had driven him out and he had begun to hurt a little less. As time passed the pain had become less and less. Eventually the pain had faded, but the memory never did. 



“I’ll tell you this, black dog, I don’t see how I can go on without her.” the man said one day to the dog at his feet.

 

The dog stood and licked his hand. The taste was really bad and the dog studied his master for a moment. The mans hair was standing up in places on his head that it never had before, and it seemed the master had grown a decent coat of fur on his jaws and face. But even by the standards of a dog the fur was matted and filthy. The lick had been shocking. The man smelled more like an animal than black dog ever had. There was no taste of soap or cologne. The smell of desperation had begun to fade, and the other one without a name was much stronger. The dog didn’t care for any of these developments at all but he stood and wagged his tail in appreciation of this small bit of affection. The man again ignored his dog and went back to rocking and drinking from his cup of rotten grapes. The dog again settled down to wait. He waited and waited.. 



The shadows passed and sometimes the man would fall asleep on his swing, he would snooze the entire night away. Once in awhile the dog would wake up to find his master humming a song and peeing over the porch rail into the weed filled flower bed. He seemed to notice the dog less and less and the dog would have to lean heavily against the mans leg and even whine to remind him that he needed some food and water. 



As the weather heated up the man became thinner and thinner. Black dog wondered if he might have a worm.

 

One day the man carried something new to the porch with him. In one hand he carried the bottle of rotten grapes and in the other was what the dog could only think of as the ‘black thing’. 



The dog didn’t know for sure what the ‘black thing ‘ was but he knew he didn’t like it. It was cold and hard, it reeked of smoke and made a very loud noise as the man pointed it at the empty bottles in the front yard. 



Now every day the man would come to the porch with his bottle of rotten grapes and the black thing. He would rock and hum and drink from his bottle. His eyes leaked all the time and black dog began to wonder if the man had forgotten him completely. Black dog waited.. 



One night the dog on the porch did not sleep. The man was walking around his den and doing something. A good dog won’t sleep while his master is awake so the dog prowled back and forth outside while the man prowled back and forth inside. 



As the dog watched the sun break into another dawn he realized that summer had passed. The leaves in the early morning light had begun to turn red and gold and the frost looked a little like smoke as the sun burned it off of the grass. 



After awhile the man came out of the house and the dog was so thrilled and surprised that he wagged his tail so hard that the whole back end of him waved from side to side. 



The fur had been scratched off of the man’s cheeks. His clothes were clean, his hair was neat and combed. In his hand he held a heaping bowl of scrambled eggs, black dog couldn’t help it. He began to drool. The man held a hot cup of coffee in his other hand. 



With joy in his voice he said “Hey Boy!” and the dog rushed over to lick his hand. 



Black dog jerked his head back as if he had been slapped. He snorted several times to clear out his sinuses and even then wrinkled his nose so much that his teeth showed. The taste was cologne and soap but it barely covered the other smell, the black smell, the smell like ashes and rot.

 

The dog was confused and worried, but that did not affect his appetite. He ate the eggs and licked the bowl clean. While he ate the man stroked his fur, and scratched his head. The dog could tell things were getting ready to change again. He held his nose high as if smelling the first cold front of the new season. 



Some time passed and the man went back into his den, he carried the bowl with him. Black dog took some comfort from the clinking that came from the kitchen. That was a sound he hadn’t heard for a long , long time. 



Some more time passed and the man again came to the porch. The man had the ‘black thing’ in his hand. 



This morning it looked more blue than black and smelled much less like smoke and more like oil. It was still bad but not as bad as it had been. 



“She’s calling me boy.. She’s been calling me.. And today I’ve got to go..” 



“But I’m gonna do you right.. I’m not gonna leave you.""



“I’m taking you with me.. We’re going home..” 



“Come here boy.. Come here..” 



With a look of love and adoration black dog went to his master. His tail was wagging and he never even heard the shot. 



He didn’t hear the second shot either.

https://cyberscoop.com/cyberattack-hits-georgia-county-at-center-of-voting-software-breach/

“The computer infrastructure of a Georgia county at the center of an effort to falsely claim that the state’s 2020 presidential election was marked by fraud was struck by a cyberattack earlier this month that prompted state officials to sever Coffee County’s access to statewide election systems. 

In a statement Friday, the Coffee County Board of Commissioners said that the county was notified by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on April 15 about unusual cyber activity in Coffee County’s IT infrastructure.”

““We took immediate action on April 16th, before Coffee County would acknowledge the issue, and cut them off from all of our systems immediately,” said Mike Hassinger, a spokesman for Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger.”

They had access for a whole day to state wide voter info.

“The breach in Coffee County is the second incident in Georgia in which IT infrastructure has been breached in counties where former President Donald Trump or his allies are embroiled in legal battles related to his effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.”


https://cyberscoop.com/georgia-election-officials-withheld-evidence-in-voting-machine-breach-group-alleges/
Then they with held evidence in the cases.

Georgia-based nonprofit that is suing the Coffee County, Georgia Board of Elections over an alleged breach of voting software weeks before President Joe Biden was sworn into office is asking a judge to sanction officials involved in the case, saying in new court filings that they repeatedly stonewalled and withheld crucial evidence during discovery.

In a 274-page filing submitted Tuesday, the group claims that Coffee County election officials withheld emails outlining what they knew about the alleged breach, relevant communications between the board and a lawyer associated with “Stop the Steal” legal efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and security camera footage of forensic experts visiting the Coffee County office where voting software was copied.


Although the breach dates back to 2021, neither the Georgia Bureau of Investigation or federal law enforcement have brought formal charges against any of the parties allegedly involved.

https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/09/02/politics/georgia-coffee-county-breach-voters

“Prosecutors allege that former county Republican Party chair Cathy Latham and former elections supervisor Misty Hampton helped to facilitate employees from a firm hired by Trump attorneys to access and copy sensitive voter data and election software. Surveillance video captured Latham waving the visitors inside, and Hampton in the office as they allegedly accessed the data. Both have pleaded not guilty.

Mike Clark, owner of some small businesses in Douglas, said he was struck by the way the surveillance footage showed the election officials entering the building in broad daylight. “You walk inside the voter registration office with no mask on, and they just give you the votes. They just give them to you! Why? Why would that be?” Clark said. “That shows you right there it ain’t just started. It’s always been just like that.”

https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/08/13/politics/coffee-county-georgia-voting-system-breach-trump

“Georgia prosecutors have messages showing Trump’s team is behind voting system breach”



Edit sorry for the formatting I made this on mobile.

This is insane. Free and fair election…… sure. Why wasn’t this brought up ever in the debate? Why wasn’t this the only ad Kamala/Biden ran. There is no way they are not complicit for not bringing this up every time they were asked a question….



Just read another article this one is EVEN WORSE:

https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/03/trump-infiltrate-voting-machines-georgia-2020.html#

While reporters were preoccupied with the spicier allegations threatening to derail the Fulton County DA’s case, the little-watched three-and-a-half-week trial revealed new information about the scope of the plot to take voting system software in Georgia by election deniers, and the jaw-dropping lack of action by Secretary of State Raffensperger to respond.

During the trial the plaintiffs presented substantial evidence showing that anyone paying attention would have noticed something was quite amiss in Coffee County, and that should have triggered an investigation by Raffensperger’s office, but didn’t. (Some of this evidence is outlined in an earlier Slate article.)

But the trial also revealed new information about attempts to gain access to Georgia’s voting machines in other counties. Plaintiffs revealed an email chain that showed that the election supervisor in Butts County had been contacted by Georgia’s (now) Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, requesting a forensic examination of the county’s voting software. (Willis’ criminal investigation of Jones was derailed when she was disqualified from the case by a conflict of interest.) Bartow County’s election supervisor testified that he’d been asked by his local GOP chair—and several unidentified attorneys—for access to copy his county’s election software. He replied with a hard no, and reported it to the secretary of state’s office.

Plaintiffs also presented a text message from a former member of the Coffee County Board of Elections to the attorney for neighboring Ware County, with a link to a story from the Gateway Pundit. The story claimed that the Trump team had obtained a voting machine from Ware, and the message said, “You have anyone to verify through?” The Ware county attorney responds, “I will verify,” and responds with a jpeg labeled “ware-county-confirmation,” but the actual image was never provided to the plaintiffs, and can’t be viewed.

And yet, even with multiple attempts to access voting systems, which the secretary was alerted to, witnesses from the secretary’s office testified that there was no investigation opened into any of these events.

The lack of any investigation by the secretary’s office looks even worse when juxtaposed with a video of Raffensperger’s top aide, Gabe Sterling, dismissively telling an audience at the Carter Center in April 2022 that the alleged voting system intrusions in Ware and Coffee counties conclusively did not happen. How could the secretary’s office determine that the breaches didn’t happen when it didn’t even look?

It gets worse. Back in early 2022, when plaintiffs first presented evidence that the breach in Coffee County had likely occurred, the secretary of state claimed to the public and the court that an investigation had been opened.

But during the trial, the secretary’s investigator assigned to the Coffee County breach allegations testified that he had been told to “hold off,” and that the secretary’s office never actually did any investigation of the Coffee County breach.

After months of holding off, the secretary’s investigators turned the matter over to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations and the state attorney general. The GBI has since been excoriated for doing a “badly inadequate” job, and the Georgia attorney general has not charged anyone involved.”

How did she not challenge at least in GA. There has to be something else going on….. ",4,1739499590.0,somethingiswrong2024,2,0.83,False
1ip04ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ip04ou/friend_going_through_a_mental_health_crisis/,Friend going through a mental health crisis,"Hi Everyone,

A close friend of mine is going through a tough time and I need to offer support, keep firm boundaries, and generally just need some advice.

A couple weeks ago he mentioned that his family (he lives in a building his grandmother owns and his family lives on the other floors, he has the top floor apartment.) was having a ""sleepover"" the night before and he hadn't gotten any sleep. He was very upset by this but I chalked it up to it's a Latino family, they like to party and be loud, he doesn't drink so they don't invite him sometimes, whatever.

But, later in the week he told me that they've done this *every night* and they're doing it just to drive him nuts. I thought it a bit odd but didn't want to get involved in a family situation so just let it go. But then he started telling me that his family had escalated things. He said they were controlling the volume of his television, pressing up on the floorboards beneath his feet so he'd trip, whispering in a targeted way so he can hear it through the walls...

Then, last weekend, he called and asked if he could stay over for the night to get away from what was happening. I told him that that would be OK. He came in like a whirlwind, obviously flustered but sober (we are both in recovery). He told me that his family had hacked all his devices and that they'd been following him from place to place. I told him I wanted to go get a cup of coffee and he freaked out a bit, thinking I was taking him somewhere to be committed.

Several times I told him that this was a safe space, no one else was here, I'd not been in touch with his family... Anyways he pulled out his phone after telling me for about an hour about all the ways his family has been ""harassing"" him to show me all the ""evidence"" that he had. This is where things get concerning, he pulled out his phone and opened it up, and just jabbed around at it for a few minutes like he'd never used a phone before! Opening up menus, messing with settings, turning systems on and off, just flipping back and forth over and over. I saw this and thought ""this must be what he's been doing all week, and the 'hacking' must be in his head.""

Then he left at like 3 in the morning but left his laptop and computer charging offline in my apartment.

Then this weekend he showed up again, saying he wanted to show me on his phone how his family was hacking him. He came up to my place and again was jabbing at his phone like he'd never seen one before. He tried to call me and it went through and he immediately hung up and was like ""SEE?"" and I was like dude? See what?

Then I listened to him tell me about how they've been following him around, he'd been staying at hotels around town and they'd followed him and were in the room next to him. I asked him if he'd seen them. He had not. I asked him if he'd spoken to them. Not face to face. Ok, but he said he ""told them to back off, and told them he'd go to the police."" And I asked him ""So, when you say you 'told them' it was just you, in a room by yourself talking out loud and they can hear you because they're 'there?'"" This flustered him.

Then I told him that I was gonna give him some tough love, that I thought he was having a paranoid crisis, that I think he needs some serious help. And he freaked out. He said they're recording all his conversations, they know who I am, they'll use what I said against him. I told him what does it matter if they know who I am? I'm just his friend. There's no conspiracy I'm wrapped up in, I'm not involved in this at all, so why does it matter?

Then yesterday his Mom called me. She's very concerned. She says the family is NOT stalking him, that he's been hearing voices and acting erratically. She also agrees that he's not using. She found some Butane Fuel cannisters at his place, and a space heater was on, which I found very concerning.

She's asked me to help, and I don't know what to do. Are there any resources for people with schizophrenia? Is there any way I can intervene on his behalf and get him some help?

He does not want to go to a hospital and is convinced his family is harassing him.

We are in NYC if that helps.

I know this was a lot, but it's been really stressing me out and any guidance is appreciated.",2,1739499511.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Now I get approached by karens and they tell me to leave or buy something when all I came for was to pee and sit down in some heat/ac to use mediocre wifi to work on stuff.

If I'm not even looking your way, head down, focused on business, why do you feel the need to come karen me and say ""buy my hyperprocessed garbage or leave""? I know it's a private business and I can respect that and leave quickly and politely, but if I might as well be a fly on the wall, why go out of your way to kick me out? Really seems unnecessarily confrontational if nobody is breathing down your neck to do so.

So I'm done with starbucks and I hope yall are with me. I feel better using libraries I pay tax dollars for, I just don't like driving 10-15 more minutes if I don't have to just for wifi.

He would stand in the center of the flat bed truck with his nose held high, smells coming faster than he would ever have imagined, eyes watering as the wind and grit blew into them but oblivious to anything other than his nose. Just to think of it even now caused the dog to twitch in his sleep. 



Sometimes they had moved cattle from place to place and the dog had helped the man by keeping them all together without causing them to become frightened and panicked. The dog could smell the fear on them and always kept them moving without scaring them too bad. The dog had learned that he could only chase the cattle when the man said, although when he had been a pup he had sometimes chased them just for fun. 



But now things were different. 



All of the animals were gone. A stranger plowed the fields. The gate had been left open in the fields. The grass grew tall and unkempt, and the paint that has always been shiny and new was now beginning to crack and peel. 



The dog had no understanding of what had happened to bring on all of the changes. For many passings of the sun after the van and the woman had left the farm had been visited by many friends and neighbors. Black dog felt like he had done a good job dealing with the people. He had not bitten any of them, and had only growled at some of them. He was a smart dog, he could tell that the man didn’t want them there but the man had let him know with a look that he wouldn’t be allowed to chase any of them off. Late at night after all of the people had gone home the man had told him that it would only be a matter of time until they stopped coming. The man had been right because the moon had changed and changed again and no one had come. 



The dog and the man didn’t go anywhere any more. The truck now sat at a crazy angle because one of it’s tires was flat. The man didn’t care so neither did the dog. Together, the man and the dog sat on the porch and waited. The man waited for the pain to stop and the dog waited for the man.

 

Every day the man would feed him, and fill his water dish, and then he would sit on the porch and swing back and forth. Often the man would drink something that smelled like rotten grapes. The dog wrinkled his nose at the smell and waited. 



Time passed as it always did and it was measured as only a dog can measure it. The shadows raced along the ground and morning would turn to noon, noon would march into afternoon, and then surrender to evening. Night would hold court and then be chased away by morning again.

 

The dog waited for the man to heal from whatever had wounded him. He could not imagine what it might be as the man didn’t limp or smell like fever or infection. A dog can tell a lot about his person when they lick them. When black dog licked his human he smelt a little soap, some hamburger helper and a sadness. He could also smell something else. The something was like desperation but worse, as if he were stuck in a trap and couldn’t get out. Black dog could not place it. He couldn’t understand it. But he didn’t like it. He didn’t like it at all. 



Black dog knew about being wounded, and he knew that somehow his man had been. 



Once when he was a puppy he had been hit by a car. He had hurt all over. He had drug himself under the porch and that is where he had stayed. After about three days hunger had driven him out and he had begun to hurt a little less. As time passed the pain had become less and less. Eventually the pain had faded, but the memory never did. 



“I’ll tell you this, black dog, I don’t see how I can go on without her.” the man said one day to the dog at his feet.

 

The dog stood and licked his hand. The taste was really bad and the dog studied his master for a moment. The mans hair was standing up in places on his head that it never had before, and it seemed the master had grown a decent coat of fur on his jaws and face. But even by the standards of a dog the fur was matted and filthy. The lick had been shocking. The man smelled more like an animal than black dog ever had. There was no taste of soap or cologne. The smell of desperation had begun to fade, and the other one without a name was much stronger. The dog didn’t care for any of these developments at all but he stood and wagged his tail in appreciation of this small bit of affection. The man again ignored his dog and went back to rocking and drinking from his cup of rotten grapes. The dog again settled down to wait. He waited and waited.. 



The shadows passed and sometimes the man would fall asleep on his swing, he would snooze the entire night away. Once in awhile the dog would wake up to find his master humming a song and peeing over the porch rail into the weed filled flower bed. He seemed to notice the dog less and less and the dog would have to lean heavily against the mans leg and even whine to remind him that he needed some food and water. 



As the weather heated up the man became thinner and thinner. Black dog wondered if he might have a worm.

 

One day the man carried something new to the porch with him. In one hand he carried the bottle of rotten grapes and in the other was what the dog could only think of as the ‘black thing’. 



The dog didn’t know for sure what the ‘black thing ‘ was but he knew he didn’t like it. It was cold and hard, it reeked of smoke and made a very loud noise as the man pointed it at the empty bottles in the front yard. 



Now every day the man would come to the porch with his bottle of rotten grapes and the black thing. He would rock and hum and drink from his bottle. His eyes leaked all the time and black dog began to wonder if the man had forgotten him completely. Black dog waited.. 



One night the dog on the porch did not sleep. The man was walking around his den and doing something. A good dog won’t sleep while his master is awake so the dog prowled back and forth outside while the man prowled back and forth inside. 



As the dog watched the sun break into another dawn he realized that summer had passed. The leaves in the early morning light had begun to turn red and gold and the frost looked a little like smoke as the sun burned it off of the grass. 



After awhile the man came out of the house and the dog was so thrilled and surprised that he wagged his tail so hard that the whole back end of him waved from side to side. 



The fur had been scratched off of the man’s cheeks. His clothes were clean, his hair was neat and combed. In his hand he held a heaping bowl of scrambled eggs, black dog couldn’t help it. He began to drool. The man held a hot cup of coffee in his other hand. 



With joy in his voice he said “Hey Boy!” and the dog rushed over to lick his hand. 



Black dog jerked his head back as if he had been slapped. He snorted several times to clear out his sinuses and even then wrinkled his nose so much that his teeth showed. The taste was cologne and soap but it barely covered the other smell, the black smell, the smell like ashes and rot.

 

The dog was confused and worried, but that did not affect his appetite. He ate the eggs and licked the bowl clean. While he ate the man stroked his fur, and scratched his head. The dog could tell things were getting ready to change again. He held his nose high as if smelling the first cold front of the new season. 



Some time passed and the man went back into his den, he carried the bowl with him. Black dog took some comfort from the clinking that came from the kitchen. That was a sound he hadn’t heard for a long , long time. 



Some more time passed and the man again came to the porch. The man had the ‘black thing’ in his hand. 



This morning it looked more blue than black and smelled much less like smoke and more like oil. It was still bad but not as bad as it had been. 



“She’s calling me boy.. She’s been calling me.. And today I’ve got to go..” 



“But I’m gonna do you right.. I’m not gonna leave you.""



“I’m taking you with me.. We’re going home..” 



“Come here boy.. Come here..” 



With a look of love and adoration black dog went to his master. His tail was wagging and he never even heard the shot. 



He didn’t hear the second shot either.

Diagnosis:
GERD
POTS
Moderate Mitral valve regurge

Medications, Ect. 
2.5 Midodrine
40 mg pantoprozale 
40 mg propranolol 2x daily
Nexplanon BC implant
Women’s vitamin gummy 1x daily


Small recap, I went in to the doctor for severe acid reflux about 3 years ago. I was throwing up, gagging, burping, and having upper abnominal pain every day for about 2 weeks before going in. During this time my doctor asked me about other problems and I told her about reoccurring dizzy spells and intolerance to exercise (a previous urgent care visit told me that this was just due to low blood pressure because I was a skinny young woman and to hydrate). I told her that I drink the recommended about of water, added more electrolytes and sodium  to my diet, and still no improvement so I just dealt with it but the heart burn was hard to ignore. She send me to get an ekg and then I was tested for H. Pylori(neg) and full blood panel (also neg). My ekg was abnormal, so they had me do an echo and found the leakage. I’ve been told by 1 dr and 2 practitioners that this leakage wasn’t alarming and to not do anything about it. I was told my 2 drs the exact opposite so now I have annual echos where no change has been shown. I take the midodrine and propranolol to help with my symptoms and pre syncope but they don’t help much. I have a stress test scheduled in a week to follow up. For the GERD I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy due to coffee ground puke about 4 months after initial visit. Nothing found, put me on pantoprozale where my issues were stagnant but not as bad. Dr told me to come off my medication 1.5 yrs later, I did this and my problems came back on immediately. Went back on the meds and now they are way more prominent. Another endoscopy and I now have ulcers and they cause me extreme pain and put me in the ER 3x where I had a CT and all they could see was swelling in my upper digestive track. And 1 of those times they saw signs of colitis. I have my 3rd endoscopy in a month. I recently had a 2nd annual Pap (my last was abnormal but they didn’t do anything about it and said to come again in a yr since i was so young?) and this one was also abnormal. They also did an internal exam and the dr was surprised at the amount of pain it caused me and said she felt a lot of swelling around my ovaries. I’ve had pain with intercourse for a few months and spotting and therefore just refrain from it. Transvaginal ultrasound scheduled on monday. I’m damn lucky to have good insurance through my mom’s work at this point. 

I feel like every time I turn around i’m having more issues. My diet at this point is extremely bland. I quit vaping 2 years ago to help with my issues. I drink lots of water, I stay under 1700 calories and try to do light exercise but I WILL pass out if I’m not careful. I can’t regulate my temperature, I can’t lift my arms above my heard without losing sight and/or passing out. I’m having lower and upper abnomal pain constantly. The ulcers were so painful I was buckled over and crying every couple minutes like contractions. Is there anyway these issues are interconnected? Is there anything i can try or a route I can go that isn’t been done yet? 

Small notes: I had covid 3 years ago. Issues seemed to get worse after that. Was never vaccinated for it. Only surgery i’ve ever had was a tonsillectomy 2 years ago due to reoccurring tonsillitis and swelling my entire life. Had asthma when I was younger and in HS but nolonger feel I struggle with it. I was diagnosed with POTS after the echo during a tilt table test and all my cardiologist have confirmed it does seem to be real due to the tachycardia spikes when I move into different positions, they don’t think it’s related to the leakage.

This story was originally written in November 2004 



The birds twittered and tweeted. The lilacs were in full bloom and the air smelled of spring. The roosters chased the hens and the hens fled, but only out of coyness and modesty. The hens had seen spring before and knew their jobs well. The rooster danced this dance yearly and he too knew all of the steps. There would be baby chicks peeping soon. 



In the green pasture the cattle were restless. The steers acted hostile and possessive, as if their bodies were somehow unaware of the missing equipment. The cows, steers, and calves fled, chased, and bantered, although they all knew that all new calves on this farm came from a trailer. 



Man sat on the porch which had become his custom and waited for the trucks, trailers, and neighbors to arrive and gather up all of the stock. 



By the time that the sun, and dust had settled, the only remaining creatures on the farm were the man and the black dog. 



The man sat and rocked listlessly on the porch swing and the dog sat at his feet and waited. 



Waiting was what the dog did more than anything and he was willing to wait as long as it took. In the very core of his brain he knew that he and his ancestors had been waiting on, and for man, since they had shared caves, and he wouldn’t have changed it for anything. 



“When the frost comes again and the leaves turn to gold and red perhaps I will have learned to breathe again without wanting to cry,” the old man mumbled as he absently scratched the head of the black lab and retreated into the house. 



The dog lay down again to wait; occasionally his waiting would be interrupted by the need to drink, or eat, or go to the yard to do his business, but for the most part he waited, and as he waited he thought in the abstract way that dogs do. 



His human was called different names by different people but to the black dog he was simply ‘man’. 



The dog was black in color and his name was a simple one. He was called ’dog’ or ’black dog’, when a longer name was required. 



The man and dog had both been smirked at when his name was called, especially if they were in town. Both of them knew it and neither of them really cared. The man didn’t care much for town, or town people, so the dog didn’t either. 



The dog and the man had been together forever as far as the dog measured time, and their lives had been filled with work and companionship. These are really the only things required for a man or dog to be happy as far as the dog was concerned, and as far as he could see they always had been. 

Then things had changed. 



The change had happened when the woman was taken away in the white van with all of the lights. The lights had been flashing red and blue into the night, and the van made the most awful noise. The dog had tried to protect his home from the lights and wailing, he had been prepared to bite the men in the funny clothes and would have if the man had not shouted at him. The man had glared at him and yelled “dog no !!” So the dog had sit still and only growled as the men carried the woman off. The dog was pleased to see the van leave, and very sad when the man had left to and he had been told to “stay”. The next day the man had returned, without the woman or the van. 



The dog and the woman had never been particularly close. The dog did not like or dislike her, any more than he liked or disliked any other creature that he shared the farm with. His loyalty however, lay with the man because that was who he belonged to. 



The dog was familiar with the woman because she would sometimes refill his water dish, or if it were very very cold, or rainy, she would sometimes call him into the mud-porch and allow him to sleep there on an old pair of the man’s coveralls, until the next morning when he and the man would go off to work. 



When the man would come they would finally get to do the things the dog had been waiting for all along. They would gather eggs, they would feed the cattle, sometimes they would go to the fields and the man would plow, while the dog lay on the floor-board of the tractor. The best times were when they would go somewhere. The back of the truck was a paradise for the dog. He would stand in the center of the flat bed truck with his nose held high, smells coming faster than he would ever have imagined, eyes watering as the wind and grit blew into them but oblivious to anything other than his nose. Just to think of it even now caused the dog to twitch in his sleep. 



Sometimes they had moved cattle from place to place and the dog had helped the man by keeping them all together without causing them to become frightened and panicked. The dog could smell the fear on them and always kept them moving without scaring them too bad. The dog had learned that he could only chase the cattle when the man said, although when he had been a pup he had sometimes chased them just for fun. 



But now things were different. 



All of the animals were gone. A stranger plowed the fields. The gate had been left open in the fields. The grass grew tall and unkempt, and the paint that has always been shiny and new was now beginning to crack and peel. 



The dog had no understanding of what had happened to bring on all of the changes. For many passings of the sun after the van and the woman had left the farm had been visited by many friends and neighbors. Black dog felt like he had done a good job dealing with the people. He had not bitten any of them, and had only growled at some of them.

Thank you so much for being a constant presence during my undergraduate and postgraduate studies. Thanks to you and Lorelai, I became a coffee addict and a fan of snow. These skills were important because as a brown Latina immigrant girl who has spent half of her life living in snowy places, studying for more than a decade and following my nerdy dreams- I wouldn't have gotten through it if I didn't fall in love with black coffee and say ""I smell snow."" 

I know you made a lot of mistakes in your life, and made terrible choices. I would never participate in an affair or become impregnated by some random or ex of mine. But watching you do all the things- watching you be super successful, a super failure, and all the things in between- has made me love myself more. 

Every time I watch the show I learn something new about you- but also about myself. My life as an adult has not always consisted of successes. I am deeply afraid not just of the outcome of my own career but also of the state of the country. I know you would be so furious to know who is president today and also at the state of journalism and the media. I know people didn't like the ending of the show- but the moral of the story has never been more clear to me than today- as I see so many women find it so difficult to like you.   
  
We are not just our success (academic or otherwise). We are our relationships. We can get through any situation, no matter how dire, because of unconditional love (and great boundaries with toxic people!). Lorelai was not a perfect mom (or friend!)- but when I watch the show- it feels like she is my mom. That I won't come home to be yelled at or be put down for the crazy things I do with my life. We will briefly escape reality and eat some junk food, and be imperfect. We will have heart-to-hearts, and support each other in our dreams. And being a feminist won't feel like it does today sometimes- a deeply isolating experience where you feel like a total psycho for supporting women's basic rights. It will just be fun! In a town where people love each other and respect the importance of local governance and local journalism. And relationships. 

Thanks for reading you guys\~ Just felt like defending my girl today. 

Love you Alexis Bledel!

I've recently gone through a lot of changes in my life that have left me feeling lost and alone. I reckon it's easiest to start from the beginning. It's a long story, so bear with me.

I feel like my mom and her family have been abusive to me for my entire life, but it's hard for me to say that because I know that I was a difficult child. We would get in screaming matches about my bedtime and going to school constantly, I hated both. I don't have a lot of happy memories about my childhood, and the few that I do have are overshadowed by many moments of fear and anger. As long as I can remember, my grandmother (mom's mom) has always told me, ""that's just how she is,"" and, ""you just have to be the bigger person."" And it's felt incredibly invalidating and just plain unfair to feel like the responsibility of keeping the peace and teaching myself to regulate my own emotions has always rested on my shoulders. I've been called manipulative since I was aged in the single-digits.

Our relationship has never seen improvement. We've been at each other's throats for as long as I can remember. When I was 15, my mom stopped working and effectively has not had any source of income since then. When I was 16, I got a job and all financial responsibility fell on me. Around that time, my grandmother told me that my mom viewed me as abusive, and those words have always stuck with me. I don't want to be an abuser; I've said some incredibly cruel things to my mother in moments of anger, and I could've always tried to get a better handle on my emotions. The way I spoke to her got worse as I got older, and I feel ashamed of some of the things I've said to and about her. It's always felt like she has to have the last word, and it feels like arguing with her is a who-can-say-the-meanest-thing contest. It feels like a chicken-or-egg dilemma; who was abusive first? 

Things between us reached a climax about a month and a half ago. We had a fun night out on New Years Eve together, but the following day, I woke up and she was just so angry because my grandmother had called her to wake her up to go grocery shopping. That anger never dissipated, she was just seething, slamming stuff around and growling for days - I holed myself up in my room for the first week of 2025 because I was afraid of starting a confrontation. I finally came out to make us both breakfast that Friday. While I was making the breakfast, an argument started, and I'm not sure whose fault it is. The argument went something like:

Mom: ""I'm sad my hydroxyzine is gone."" (I later found out she had been taking four times her prescribed dose)

Me: ""I've never had Vistaril make me loopy the way it does you."" (we're both prescribed the same dose of hydroxyzine/Vistaril)

Mom: ""I'm *not loopy*.""

Me: ""Well whatever you are, I can tell by the way you're sitting."" (she was fully reclined with one foot on the coffee table and the other on the couch, and her arm resting above her head, full stoner couchlock position)

Mom: ""I'm sitting like this because I'm in constant pain."" (said with much hostility and anger evident)

Me: ""Why are you getting so pressed?""

Mom: ""Because you have no idea what you're talking about.""

Me: ""The bottom line of what I'm saying is that hydroxyzine doesn't affect me the way it affects you, you just want to be contrarian to everything I say.""

Mom: ""Stop analyzing me.""

Me: ""You stop analyzing me.""

And then, she stormed off. A few minutes later, my grandmother calls me and says, ""Do you have a friend's house you can go to or something?"" And in all honesty, I went ballistic. I told her I'm not letting her kick me out like she's been doing every time she's mad at me ever since I was 14. I told my grandmother that she needs to either come pick my mom up or convince her to go to a crisis stabilization unit; grandmother agreed that she needed to go to CSU but stated that my mom never listens to her about those things. I scream some more obscenities about my mom and said some hurtful things to my grandmother as well (""it's YOUR fault she's like this!!""), which I feel remorseful and ashamed of. In all honesty, this argument is probably the angriest I have ever been in my life.   
  
A few minutes after she hung up on me, police knock on the door and immediately say, ""where's the knife?"" and I'm just like, ""what knife? I don't have a knife???"" It turns out, my mom called the cops on me and said that I had a knife. The cops and I had a conversation about what happened, and they seemed to side with me, telling me that I have every right to move out and that I don't have to be around her. She told the cops she wanted to kill herself, so they called an ambulance to take her to the hospital, but she decided not to admit herself and instead returned home while I was at a friend's house. A few days later, she texted me this long paragraph about how she knows she's hurt me and that she's sorry but that she can't be around me and that I'm ""the reason she continues to breathe."" Effectively kicking me out, knowing I had no where to go. 

A few weeks later, my grandmother gave me $50 to by a part to fix my car. Then, she said she needed the money back, so I go on Venmo to send her the money back and saw that she had sent my mother well over $50 to buy weed and fast food. So I told her that I'm not giving her the $50 back, if she needs it that bad, she can ask my mom for it. Again, I'm not proud of this - my train of thought was, ""well why would I subliminally give my mom $50 through my grandmother?"" which, admittedly, is some mental gymnastics.  
  
 I blew up on her again, saying that I was sick of my mom's victim complex, and sick of my grandmother enabling it, sick of watching her baby my mom and holding me to such a high standard when I'm the one who deserves to be babied. About half a week later, I get a text from my uncle (mom's brother) while I'm in class, a long, mean paragraph along the lines of, ""If you can't talk to my mother with respect, don't talk to her at all. I don't want to hear your side because it doesn't matter. Get your shit together, get your head right. If you can't be nice you will be cut out of our lives"" and all sorts of other things. So I responded, ""fuck off"" and blocked his number. I got kicked off the family phone plan after that, I guess symbolizing the end of my relationship with them. 

Neither of my uncles, nor my grandmother, nor my mother have reached out to me since any of this happened. So here I am, with no family in the area, no home (staying in a dorm covered by my university for the semester), feeling lost and alone.   
  
I tried to tell this story openly, from as neutral a point of view as I can, disclosing some of the cruel things I said, because I want to know if I'm the one in the wrong and if I should apologize to them. It feels like with four people all against me, I'm in the wrong, but I also can't help but feel this great sense of injustice against myself. Am I the abusive narcissist with a victim complex here, or are they?

1ip00e0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1ip00e0/to_determine_if_atrioc_is_in_touch_with_the/,"To determine if Atrioc is in touch with the average Superbowl viewer, I took notes on my Moms reaction to every Superbowl ad he reviewed. Here are my findings.","Atrioc was talking about how the target audience for Superbowl ads is pretty old. Since I'm not old, this had made it real hard to scientifically determine how accurate his tier list really was. So I found the one old person I could pressure into watching an Atrioc video, my Mom, and then took notes on her reactions to each ad featured in Atrioc's ""I Ranked Every Super Bowl Commercial This Year"" video. Then using this information I estimated the ads placement within an old persons tier list, and compared it to Atrioc's tier list.   
Here are my findings:

Pfizer:  
She seemed interested until she realized it a Pfizer ad, then she went ""oh, who wants to see a Pfizer ad"" and zoned out for the rest of it's duration.  
Mom: Boring Negative, Atrioc: Boring Positive

Ram Trucks:  
She seemed to be mostly disinterested, perhaps an after-effect of the Pfizer ad. But she enjoyed the Dragon.  
Mom: Boring Positive, Atrioc: Boring Positive

Ritz:   
I have no notes other than ""she didn't even react"".  
Mom: Boring Negative, Atrioc: Boring Negative

Dunkin:  
She rolled her eyes at most of it, and was extremely confused at the actor guy emerging from the vat of Coffee. She turned to me and went ""what is happening?"" She seemed to really dislike it.   
Mom: Truly Bad, Atrioc: Truly Bad

Turbo Tax:  
Despite informing my mother that I was taking notes on her reactions to the ads, she still went on her phone during this ad. While it's clearly a sign that this was a boring negative ad, I am still somewhat concerned with the validity of this data. Thankfully she paid full attention to the remaining ads.   
Mom: Boring Negative, Atrioc: Boring Negative

MSC Cruise:  
Very little reaction. She seemed bored, and I think she rolled her eyes at the European dude when she realized he had an accent.   
Mom: Boring Negative, Atrioc: Boring Negative

Phone Call Interlude:  
My mother found the call with Atriocs dad very endearing. She laughed twice during it.   
Mom: Truly Good, Atrioc: No ranking was given, though I assume he likes talking with his dad.

UberEats  
The first ad I think she truly loved. She laughed three times during the ad, and was smiling at the jokes.   
Mom: Truly Good, Atrioc: Truly Good

RocketMoney:  
She said ""wait is this... oh it's this guys thing"" and laughed. I think that's a positive reaction.   
Mom: Truly Good, Atrioc: Paid to give this Truly Good

Pringles:  
The first ad she said she saw live during the Superbowl (we live in Canada and so get Canadian ads). She said ""oh, this stupid ad"". Was not impressed with it, though she remarked that some of the people ""looked cool without a mustache""   
Mom: Truly Bad, Atrioc: Boring Positive

Reeses:  
During the ad she turned to me and said ""ooo, that looks good"". Can't think of a higher endorsement.  
Mom: Truly Good, Atrioc: Truly Good

Lays:  
This was one of her favorites. She said that she found it ""so cute"" and loved the girl planting the potato. When Atrioc suggested that they probably didn't buy from family farms she said ""no way, of course they do"" and seemed annoyed with Atriocs cynicism. I have no choice but to trust my mother on this one.  
Mom: Truly Good, Atrioc: Boring Positive

Doritos:  
She liked it and said it ""reminded her of the alien movie thing that they played before movies, you know, the alien who has the beam going into the kids room with that big panel of switches"". I did not know, but I nodded and pretended I did. She also laughed at the guy wearing an alien mask.   
Mom: Truly Good, Atrioc: Truly Good

Lilo and Stitch:  
She said ""awww"" and seemed to love Stitch running around on the field. But when the editor added the note saying that Atrioc didn't put it in a tier she said ""wait, why didn't he give a rating?"". I remarked that he probably just forgot, and she said ""he's always doing that, he really needs to get his sh\*t together"". She seemed slightly annoyed at his forgetfulness, though I think she was only half serious and was joking a bit. This is likely related to past experiences she's heard about, with you forgetting to read my DMs on discord (it's Kirava on Discord if you want to win back my mothers heart Big A), so I wouldn't put it all on the ad.  
Mom: Truly Good, Atrioc: ""get your sh\*t together"" 

Angel Soft:   
She HATED this ad. She groaned when it came on and said it was ""the worst ad"" and called it ""truly stupid"".  
Mom: Generational Waste of Money, Atrioc: He didn't give it a rating again

Booking (Muppets):  
Almost no reaction. I don't think she's ever been a Muppets fan.   
Mom: Boring Negative, Atrioc: Boring Positive

Breasts:  
This one got her attention. She seemed confused at first and then turned to me and said ""why are they doing that?"". She seemed weirded out by it and I guess thought it was a pervert thing. But when she realized it was about breast cancer awareness she flipped on a dime and thought it was a good idea. Though she still complained a bit about all the breasts being shown.   
Mom: Truly Good, Atrioc: Truely Good

Meta:  
She mostly looked bored and confused. The only reaction she had was when she found out it was based on a real story, and she rolled her eyes. I don't think she likes expensive art bananas.  
Mom: Boring Negative, Atrioc: Truly Bad

ChatGPT:  
Another snoozer, I think she liked the song though.   
Mom: Boring Negative, Atrioc: Boring Negative

Tubi:  
I was suprised by this one. She seemed totally unphased by the cowboy-hat-skull and smirked a couple times during the ad. She seemed to like it, though not by much.  
Mom: Boring Positive, Atrioc: Truly Bad

Mt Dew:  
When the seals first started singing she began to smile and get happy. But when they revealed the CGI Seal seal... she laughed out loud and said ""I love this"". She continued to be totally into the ad the entire time, and just liked it a lot.   
Mom: Truly Good, Atrioc: Truly Good

Glidestep:   
Dear god she hated it. She said ""this is so f\*ing stupid. this is so stupid"". She rolled her eyes and just did not enjoy it at all. I don't even think she liked Martha Stewart, though I didn't ask what bad history they had to cause that.   
Mom: Generational Waste of Money, Atrioc: Truly Bad

Michelob Ultra:  
She was laughing every time Willem Dafoe showed his face on screen. When Atrioc commented ""I think it only works cause Dafoe really committed"" she looked at me, nodded and said ""he gets it"".  
Mom: Truly Good, Atrioc: Truly Good

Nike:  
Another ad she saw live. She groaned and said ""oh I hate this ad"" right as it started playing. When I asked why she basically said that ""Oh now Nike thinks they can try to win women back"", and then said some stuff that boiled down to her thinking Nike had gone super woke in all their advertising, and was now trying to convince women to like them again. But she wasn't having it. She also said ""You can't win, so win? What does that mean? I don't get it?""  
Mom: Truly Bad, Atrioc: Truly Good

Kanye:  
She seemed very confused at first, but when he showed off his teeth she burst out laughing and said ""man he's good"". Then talked about how she bet he made a ton of money from this.   
Mom: Truly Good, Atrioc: Truly Good  


So with all that done, what have we learned? Well. we learned that Atrioc has a pretty good hit rate with older women. Out of the 23 ads where both of them gave an opinion, she agreed with Atriocs tier list in 15 of them, and only disagreed 8 times. Most of those 8 were pretty small misses too. Overall I'd say that   
1) Atrioc is mostly in touch with the average superbowl viewer.   
2) Watching Atrioc with family is a rather enjoyable experience.",21,1739499132.0,atrioc,5,1.0,False

Solomon Swaney



This story was originally written in November 2004 



The birds twittered and tweeted. The lilacs were in full bloom and the air smelled of spring. The roosters chased the hens and the hens fled, but only out of coyness and modesty. The hens had seen spring before and knew their jobs well. The rooster danced this dance yearly and he too knew all of the steps. There would be baby chicks peeping soon. 



In the green pasture the cattle were restless. The steers acted hostile and possessive, as if their bodies were somehow unaware of the missing equipment. The cows, steers, and calves fled, chased, and bantered, although they all knew that all new calves on this farm came from a trailer. 



Man sat on the porch which had become his custom and waited for the trucks, trailers, and neighbors to arrive and gather up all of the stock. 



By the time that the sun, and dust had settled, the only remaining creatures on the farm were the man and the black dog. 



The man sat and rocked listlessly on the porch swing and the dog sat at his feet and waited. 



Waiting was what the dog did more than anything and he was willing to wait as long as it took. In the very core of his brain he knew that he and his ancestors had been waiting on, and for man, since they had shared caves, and he wouldn’t have changed it for anything. 



“When the frost comes again and the leaves turn to gold and red perhaps I will have learned to breathe again without wanting to cry,” the old man mumbled as he absently scratched the head of the black lab and retreated into the house. 



The dog lay down again to wait; occasionally his waiting would be interrupted by the need to drink, or eat, or go to the yard to do his business, but for the most part he waited, and as he waited he thought in the abstract way that dogs do. 



His human was called different names by different people but to the black dog he was simply ‘man’. 



The dog was black in color and his name was a simple one. He was called ’dog’ or ’black dog’, when a longer name was required. 



The man and dog had both been smirked at when his name was called, especially if they were in town. Both of them knew it and neither of them really cared. The man didn’t care much for town, or town people, so the dog didn’t either. 



The dog and the man had been together forever as far as the dog measured time, and their lives had been filled with work and companionship. These are really the only things required for a man or dog to be happy as far as the dog was concerned, and as far as he could see they always had been. 

Then things had changed. 



The change had happened when the woman was taken away in the white van with all of the lights. The lights had been flashing red and blue into the night, and the van made the most awful noise. The dog had tried to protect his home from the lights and wailing, he had been prepared to bite the men in the funny clothes and would have if the man had not shouted at him. The man had glared at him and yelled “dog no !!” So the dog had sit still and only growled as the men carried the woman off. The dog was pleased to see the van leave, and very sad when the man had left to and he had been told to “stay”. The next day the man had returned, without the woman or the van. 



The dog and the woman had never been particularly close. The dog did not like or dislike her, any more than he liked or disliked any other creature that he shared the farm with. His loyalty however, lay with the man because that was who he belonged to. 



The dog was familiar with the woman because she would sometimes refill his water dish, or if it were very very cold, or rainy, she would sometimes call him into the mud-porch and allow him to sleep there on an old pair of the man’s coveralls, until the next morning when he and the man would go off to work. 



When the man would come they would finally get to do the things the dog had been waiting for all along. They would gather eggs, they would feed the cattle, sometimes they would go to the fields and the man would plow, while the dog lay on the floor-board of the tractor. The best times were when they would go somewhere. The back of the truck was a paradise for the dog. He would stand in the center of the flat bed truck with his nose held high, smells coming faster than he would ever have imagined, eyes watering as the wind and grit blew into them but oblivious to anything other than his nose. Just to think of it even now caused the dog to twitch in his sleep. 



Sometimes they had moved cattle from place to place and the dog had helped the man by keeping them all together without causing them to become frightened and panicked. The dog could smell the fear on them and always kept them moving without scaring them too bad. The dog had learned that he could only chase the cattle when the man said, although when he had been a pup he had sometimes chased them just for fun. 



But now things were different. 



All of the animals were gone. A stranger plowed the fields. The gate had been left open in the fields. The grass grew tall and unkempt, and the paint that has always been shiny and new was now beginning to crack and peel. 



The dog had no understanding of what had happened to bring on all of the changes. For many passings of the sun after the van and the woman had left the farm had been visited by many friends and neighbors. Black dog felt like he had done a good job dealing with the people. He had not bitten any of them, and had only growled at some of them. He was a smart dog, he could tell that the man didn’t want them there but the man had let him know with a look that he wouldn’t be allowed to chase any of them off. Late at night after all of the people had gone home the man had told him that it would only be a matter of time until they stopped coming. The man had been right because the moon had changed and changed again and no one had come. 



The dog and the man didn’t go anywhere any more. The truck now sat at a crazy angle because one of it’s tires was flat. The man didn’t care so neither did the dog. Together, the man and the dog sat on the porch and waited. The man waited for the pain to stop and the dog waited for the man.

 

Every day the man would feed him, and fill his water dish, and then he would sit on the porch and swing back and forth. Often the man would drink something that smelled like rotten grapes. The dog wrinkled his nose at the smell and waited. 



Time passed as it always did and it was measured as only a dog can measure it. The shadows raced along the ground and morning would turn to noon, noon would march into afternoon, and then surrender to evening. Night would hold court and then be chased away by morning again.

 

The dog waited for the man to heal from whatever had wounded him. He could not imagine what it might be as the man didn’t limp or smell like fever or infection. A dog can tell a lot about his person when they lick them. When black dog licked his human he smelt a little soap, some hamburger helper and a sadness. He could also smell something else. The something was like desperation but worse, as if he were stuck in a trap and couldn’t get out. Black dog could not place it. He couldn’t understand it. But he didn’t like it. He didn’t like it at all. 



Black dog knew about being wounded, and he knew that somehow his man had been. 



Once when he was a puppy he had been hit by a car. He had hurt all over. He had drug himself under the porch and that is where he had stayed. After about three days hunger had driven him out and he had begun to hurt a little less. As time passed the pain had become less and less. Eventually the pain had faded, but the memory never did. 



“I’ll tell you this, black dog, I don’t see how I can go on without her.” the man said one day to the dog at his feet.

 

The dog stood and licked his hand. The taste was really bad and the dog studied his master for a moment. The mans hair was standing up in places on his head that it never had before, and it seemed the master had grown a decent coat of fur on his jaws and face. But even by the standards of a dog the fur was matted and filthy. The lick had been shocking. The man smelled more like an animal than black dog ever had. There was no taste of soap or cologne. The smell of desperation had begun to fade, and the other one without a name was much stronger. The dog didn’t care for any of these developments at all but he stood and wagged his tail in appreciation of this small bit of affection. The man again ignored his dog and went back to rocking and drinking from his cup of rotten grapes. The dog again settled down to wait. He waited and waited.. 



The shadows passed and sometimes the man would fall asleep on his swing, he would snooze the entire night away. Once in awhile the dog would wake up to find his master humming a song and peeing over the porch rail into the weed filled flower bed. He seemed to notice the dog less and less and the dog would have to lean heavily against the mans leg and even whine to remind him that he needed some food and water. 



As the weather heated up the man became thinner and thinner. Black dog wondered if he might have a worm.

 

One day the man carried something new to the porch with him. In one hand he carried the bottle of rotten grapes and in the other was what the dog could only think of as the ‘black thing’. 



The dog didn’t know for sure what the ‘black thing ‘ was but he knew he didn’t like it. It was cold and hard, it reeked of smoke and made a very loud noise as the man pointed it at the empty bottles in the front yard. 



Now every day the man would come to the porch with his bottle of rotten grapes and the black thing. He would rock and hum and drink from his bottle. His eyes leaked all the time and black dog began to wonder if the man had forgotten him completely. Black dog waited.. 



One night the dog on the porch did not sleep. The man was walking around his den and doing something. A good dog won’t sleep while his master is awake so the dog prowled back and forth outside while the man prowled back and forth inside. 



As the dog watched the sun break into another dawn he realized that summer had passed. The leaves in the early morning light had begun to turn red and gold and the frost looked a little like smoke as the sun burned it off of the grass. 



After awhile the man came out of the house and the dog was so thrilled and surprised that he wagged his tail so hard that the whole back end of him waved from side to side. 



The fur had been scratched off of the man’s cheeks. His clothes were clean, his hair was neat and combed. In his hand he held a heaping bowl of scrambled eggs, black dog couldn’t help it. He began to drool. The man held a hot cup of coffee in his other hand. 



With joy in his voice he said “Hey Boy!” and the dog rushed over to lick his hand. 



Black dog jerked his head back as if he had been slapped. He snorted several times to clear out his sinuses and even then wrinkled his nose so much that his teeth showed. The taste was cologne and soap but it barely covered the other smell, the black smell, the smell like ashes and rot.

 

The dog was confused and worried, but that did not affect his appetite. He ate the eggs and licked the bowl clean. While he ate the man stroked his fur, and scratched his head. The dog could tell things were getting ready to change again. He held his nose high as if smelling the first cold front of the new season. 



Some time passed and the man went back into his den, he carried the bowl with him. Black dog took some comfort from the clinking that came from the kitchen. That was a sound he hadn’t heard for a long , long time. 



Some more time passed and the man again came to the porch. The man had the ‘black thing’ in his hand. 



This morning it looked more blue than black and smelled much less like smoke and more like oil. It was still bad but not as bad as it had been. 



“She’s calling me boy.. She’s been calling me.. And today I’ve got to go..” 



“But I’m gonna do you right.. I’m not gonna leave you.""



“I’m taking you with me.. We’re going home..” 



“Come here boy.. Come here..” 



With a look of love and adoration black dog went to his master. His tail was wagging and he never even heard the shot. 



He didn’t hear the second shot either.

With her limited schedule, she was able to fit me in for breakfast/coffee but only on Friday which happened to be Valentine's Day.

I didn't think much of it as my girlfriend already said she was going to be busy on Friday morning, so I said ok to meeting my female friend. I told my girlfriend also and she was really annoyed. She said she would rather me spend the whole day with my friend during her competition than me see another girl on Valentine's Day as it sends out the wrong message.

TLDR; My girlfriend is unhappy that I booked a coffee/breakfast with my out of town female friend on Valentine's Day, even when she is unavailable in the morning.

From getting a Chemex, along with a Fellow Ode v2 to simply getting a bottomless portafilter and making the built-in grinder of the BBE single dose with bellows. Over the past several months, I have just become tired of waiting on my milk to steam and just want to plunge into better machines. So I ask, what is the best option to go to?



After doing months of research, I believe I am looking at getting a DF64 v2, Timemore 064S, or a Niche Zero/Duo for a grinder paired with either a Profitec Move or Drive. I have narrowed all my options down to these machines but do not know where to go next.



I plan to get the grinder before the machine before any of you mention to do that first!



As for my reasons for wanting to upgrade, it is simply I want to have a dual boiler machine that has good steaming capabilities that has longevity in mind.



I am open to suggestions but my budget for the machine cannot go over the Profitec Drive (high-end) and the grinder cannot go over Niche pricing.",2,1739499018.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I'm experiencing a really odd issue with my new Samsung A25 using Microsoft Edge as my autofill app. When I log in to websites via the Edge browser, it correctly fills in my most up-to-date passwords. However, when I use the equivalent apps (for example, my coffee shop’s app), it still autofills an old password—even though I’ve updated it everywhere.

This issue isn’t isolated to one app; it’s happening across multiple apps. I’ve tried resyncing my Edge data and every other troubleshooting step I can think of, but nothing seems to resolve it.

My laptop and desktop are both in the shop right now, so I'm stuck on my phone and really need a solution. Has anyone else experienced this, or does anyone have any ideas on how to fix it?

1iozw5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1iozw5b/i_was_a_professional_mourner_during_the_80s_the/,I was a professional mourner during the 80s. The last assignment I ever accepted nearly got me killed. (Part 1),"*“You sure this is the right place, Hank?”* I shouted from outside the limousine.

The husky chauffeur didn’t respond, attention transfixed on his handheld television, fiddling with the antennae to minimize static. A cold October wind howled through the valley, causing the slit of my black dress to flutter against my thigh. Frustration mounted behind my eyes as I waited for an answer, glaring through the passenger’s side window while shivering from the violent squall.

Getting the sense that he was intentionally ignoring me, I pulled trembling fists from the pockets of my wool coat and improvised a drum solo against the thick glass. My knuckles were so cold that I barely felt them make contact.

The amateur rendition of Van Halen’s *“Hot For Teacher”* was enough to get his attention. A scowl curled up the side of his face. Without moving his eyes away from the blinking screen, Hank leaned over to roll down the window, his beer gut flopping awkwardly over the central console like a pillowcase half filled with maple syrup. He gave the crank two lazy twists, and the window creaked down a few inches.

*“Robin - what the fuck is the matter? It’s the goddamned World Series,”* he said, pointing at the small TV and acting like I was unaware of that fact. Hank had nearly careened off the road multiple times on the thirty-minute drive over here, seemingly unable to drag his eyes away from the game for more than a handful of seconds at a time.

I felt a myriad of insults thump against the back of my teeth, begging to be unleashed, but I swallowed my annoyance.

*“Can you please just look at the sign?”* I pleaded, gesturing to the name listed above a picture of the deceased.

*“…’85 wasn’t our year, but ‘87…’87 is for The Cardinals…”* he muttered, still glued to the feed.

*“Hank, for the love of God, confirm that I’m walking into the right funeral or I’m getting back into the car. I was told the guy’s name was ""‘John’, not ‘Jom’. The damn sign says ‘Jom’.”* I snapped.

Hank slumped his shoulders with childlike exaggeration and sighed. Reluctantly, he shoved a meaty claw into the breast pocket of his blazer, digging around for the instructions given to him by our escort agency. With a crumpled slip of paper in hand, his pupils finally detached from the game. Hastily, he scanned the name and date.

*“Looks right to me,”* he remarked. Before I could ask to see it too, he spat chewing tobacco that had been resting along his gumline into the slip. My eyes widened in disbelief as I watched Hank wrap the paper around the brown-black ichor, only to then toss the malformed lump into his coffee cup.

*“Christ, Hank. You couldn’t have just handed it to me, like a human being? Or are you not a human being? Maybe you're actually some human-shaped donkey? Does that sound right?”*

The insult finally brought his eyes to meet mine. Instead of anger, he shot me a threatening grin. A wolf’s smile, bearing hungry canines in my direction.

*“Look, doll - how about you tiptoe those fragile, porcelain feet up to the home’s concierge and ask about the service? I’ll wait here. If it ain’t right, we’ll go back to the office.”*

He expected a sheepish reply, but I sure as shit didn’t give him one, instead providing a thumbs up with my right hand and a middle finger with my left. I didn’t scare easy. Not only that, but I’ve been in the escort business long enough to know the difference between an actual predator and a small man making empty threats.

When I turned to walk up the cobblestone path that led to the funeral home, my ears became filled with the sound of Hank slamming his foot down on the accelerator, tires screeching against asphalt. Didn’t even bother to turn back around, honestly. No point.

*“Asshole.”* I murmured, securing my purse under my arm to prevent it from blowing away as I approached the opulent, repurposed plantation house.

The mansion’s white pillars loomed over me as I carefully climbed the porch steps, stilettos clacking against the refurbished wood. As I stepped toward the front door, a surge of anxiety unexpectedly sprinted up the length of my spine and planted itself at the top of my neck, crackling around the base of my skull like electricity from an exposed wire. With my heartbeat galloping in my chest, I took a deep breath and twisted the knob, not willing to let nervous energy prevent me from earning my keep.

A lot of what happened to me was out of my control, but I did one thing wrong that day. My gut was screaming for me to turn around. It implored me to sprint back down those stairs and into the street like the devil themself was close behind me, nipping at my heels.

But I ignored the feeling, contorted my face into an expression of grief, and pushed on, unknowingly putting myself into the Cult of the Scarab's crosshairs, intruding on their rite of sacred renewal.

\----------

*“Right this way, ma’am,”* said the funeral director, leading me into a familiar narrow hallway behind the lobby. Only a week earlier I’d been at this funeral home, pretending to grieve over someone else. As we walked, I reviewed the details I’d received concerning the deceased, provided to my agency by his company’s board of investors.

*Pharmaceutical CFO. Passed in his late sixties. Very private. Had two previous marriages. Right hand was mangled during his tenure in Vietnam, doesn’t bother with a prosthetic. Months before his death, rumors of him being gay cropped up in the tabloids.*

*I’m playing his secret lover. An unknown buxom paramour, weeping over the loss of their sugar daddy, dispelling the whispers of his potential homosexuality.*

People purchased my time for an assortment of different reasons. Sometimes, I was hired by the soon-to-be deceased, arriving at their memorial service just to boost the overall number of attendees visibly present and grieving. Other times, the request was more specific and it wasn’t the deceased who was hiring me.

This was one of those *other times.*

It wasn’t glamorous work, lying at some poor sap’s funeral on the behalf of someone else and their interests, but it was much preferable to the labor I performed when I was first hired. Think fishnet stockings and disagreements over the virtues of condom use.

All that said, it'd be disingenuous to say I wasn't proud of myself.

This was my niche, and despite the seediness, it was mine, and I was good at it. Considered an expert, actually. Anyone can show up and be a pretty face in the crowd; a twenty-something with running mascara and a nice ass cartoonishly *boo-hooing* into an open casket. But me? I played the assigned role with tact and nuance. I sold a narrative, and nine times out of ten, my marks bought it. 

The key was you needed to be a proficient improviser. 

Discretion was the name of the game in my line of work; I rarely got a lot of background information about the deceased to work with. Meant I had to be capable of thinking on my toes - bobbing and weaving through conversations like my life depended on it.

Ironically, though, if I wasn’t so damn convincing, I might not have ended up almost suffocating to death less than an hour after the funeral concluded.

\----------

I expected all the usual sounds of organized memorial would become audible as we approached the reception hall; sobbing, a pipe organ singing its quiet lamentations, hushed arguments over the division of an inheritance. Sounds most people associated with deep sorrow. To me, however, mourning sounded like work. It was ambient noise I had become so accustomed to that I barely even noticed it.

But that’s not what I heard as we drew closer to the service. Quite the opposite, actually. Joyful sounds reverberated down the hallway. As the funeral director opened the door to the reception hall, I heard laughing and the clinking of glasses. The sparkling timbre of a wedding filled my ears, not the joyless dirge of a wake.

I stepped in, and for a moment, I truly believed I was walking in on some kind of themed birthday party. Every attendee sported a pure white outfit, head to toe. The previously jubilant noise fizzled out into dead silence when they saw me enter, adorned in funerary black. I was nearly about to excuse myself back through the door when I spied a young man at the opposite end of the vast room, dressed in a black three-piece suit, leaning wearily against an enormous marble coffin.

*“Is…is this Jom’s funeral?”* I managed to sputter out into the motionless crowd.

The fifty or so funeral goers remained silent. I could tell that something about my arrival was intensely befuddling, with looks of confusion painted over the attendee’s faces. Eventually, the shrill squeaking of poorly lubricated metal wheels broke the silence. The crowd parted to reveal an elderly woman in a wheelchair pushing herself towards me. She peered from side-to-side as she approached, observing the still petrified mourners staring at me with a look of disapproval.

*“Oh, would you relax? Go back to what you were doing. I’ll figure it out. Khepri save us, y’all would be startled shitless by a ladybug if it flew at you too fast,”* she croaked. Slowly, the figures in white pulled their attention away from me, and the lively chatter resumed, albeit at a much lower volume.

With the funeral reanimated, the elderly woman brought her eyes to mine, converting her scowl into a toothy grin. A wispy white dress hung loosely from her skeletal frame, giving her the appearance of a mobility-challenged banshee. The weight of a golden broach pulled the front of her dress forward at the collarbone, revealing the outlines of her upper ribs through thin, liver spotted skin. The accessory was about the size of a golf ball, and it depicted a beetle with what looked like a lotus flower etched onto its wings.

*“And you are, dear?”* she asked, settling in front of me by using a levered brake to halt the wheelchair’s momentum.

Based on the woman’s command of the other mourners and her wizened appearance, I made an educated guess as to her identity.

*“Hi…you must be Jom’s mother?”*

She nodded, her brow furrowing and her grin melting away as her head tilted up and down. The matriarch studied me intensely, her expression now twisted into one of confusion, like those of the mourners when they first saw me.

Relief fluttered through my chest. I briefly savored the pleasurable rush that came after the anxiety of a calculated risk. Then I smiled, took a generous inhale, and continued, launching into an ad libbed speech I had given countless times before.

*""It is nice finally to meet you. I…I wish it wasn’t under these circumstances, and I wish I knew your first name, but you know how private Jom can be-”*

I paused and forced a chuckle, letting tears well up as I broke eye contact - body language that screamed “*I’m struggling to use past tense now that he's dead, oh the sweet misery”*. A sigh fell from my lips, and then I picked up where I left off.

*“…you know how private Jom* ***could*** *be. I’m Tara. Your son and I were together for the last year or so. What’s your first name, ma’am?”*

Unexpectedly, I watched her eyes widen with some mix of alarm and disbelief.

*“It’s…it’s Akila”*

Without saying anything more, she abruptly pivoted her head and torso around, scanning the room for someone. Akila seemingly couldn’t locate them in the crowd, so she just started shouting a name.

*“Horus! Hoooorus! Could someone bring my grandson over?”*

The figures closest to us leaped into action, clearly fighting to be the person that fulfilled Akila’s request. Within seconds, one of the attendees, a hulking middle-aged man with biceps like tree trunks, returned with the kid in the black suit that had been previously leaning against the coffin, practically dragging the miserable looking young man by the wrist to his grandmother.

*“Ah! There you are, Horus.”* Akila cooed.

The boy barely responded, giving his elder an affirmative grunt. Before he was pulled from the crowd, I was laser focused on selling my story, constructing answers to questions that hadn’t even been asked yet. Seeing the anguish dripping off his features broke my concentration.

He looked to be in his early twenties, about six-feet tall, with a shaved head and a half crescent nose ring connecting his nostrils. His eyes were saturated with a deep, reflective sadness, his gaze empty and distant, like he was watching a memory rather than actually seeing anything physically in front of him. The corners of his mouth were collapsed into a rigid, immovable frown, the type of vacant expression that’s left over only after you’ve already completely exhausted every other painful emotion.

My heart broke for him. Whatever familial weirdness was currently on display, with the perfect white dress code and the inappropriately cheery atmosphere, the kid seemed like he was the only one experiencing genuine grief. His dad was dead, and he looked hurt and alone. 

That empathy would last about another ten minutes.

*“Horus…this woman, Tara, is claiming to have been with your father, and she’s showing up here dressed like…dressed like that. Did you know anything about this?”*

*This might be game over,* I thought to myself. *Need to come up with a way to recover.* 

He pointed his empty gaze at me. For a second, his eyes remained cold. But then, like the flash of blinding white light before the explosion of an atomic bomb, his expression instantly brightened and became animated. It wasn’t recognition that had reignited Horus; it was something else.

It was an idea. I didn’t know it at the time, but Horus was a pretty damn good improvisor as well.

*“Yeah, I know her. Dad mentioned her a few times in passing. Told me that she may or may not show up today. He wasn’t sure whether she really loved him or not, but I think he told her to show up if she did really love him.”*

He paused, calculating what to say next.

*“Tara’s an outsider. Dad wasn’t sure that we’d accept her, especially after what happened with Diane.”*

Akila turned back to me, now stone-faced and deathly serious.

*“Well, Tara, is all that true? You’re here because you loved my son?”*

I didn’t have long to contemplate the strangeness that was unfolding in front me, so I acted on instinct.

Terrible call. 

*“…yes! Yes, I loved Jom. That’s why I’m here.”*

Horus nearly crumbled to the ground, his immovable frown dissipating into a grin swollen with ecstasy.

*“Well…well alright then. That’s very noble of you, to come here of your own volition, espousing your love from my son. Bassel, could you escort Tara to the front? Show her where family sits? The eulogy will be starting in a few minutes.”* Akila replied.

The brawny gentleman with the tree-trunk biceps walked over, placing one massive arm forward to guide me and the other massive arm on my shoulder, as if to make sure I wasn’t going anywhere.

Behind me, I heard Horus cackling, doubling over and practically wheezing from whatever he found to be so goddamned funny.

\----------

There was a certain comedy to the way Akila had been positioned to deliver the eulogy. I couldn’t appreciate the humor of it at the time, with Bassel following me like a shadow, his looming presence causing a veritable chorus of alarm bells to ring loudly in my skull. But, in retrospect, I remember the juxtaposition of her in front of the casket being genuinely funny.

She was just so absurdly small, and the coffin was just so absurdly big. A marble torpedo behind a human earthworm, wrinkled skin flapping up and down as she spewed her ritualistic bullshit into the microphone.

*“Jom was a wonderful son, a loving father, and a devoted vicar of Khepri.”* Akila boomed, voice tinged with bursts of static from cheap speaker systems.

*“When Jom was on death’s door, we all felt his pain. In terms of renewal, he was without an ideal conduit. We all still grieve the loss of Diane, consumed by heresy, leaving him without love and Horus without a mother.”*

I turned to Bassel, pointing to my bladder and then pointing to the door. It was a lie; nature wasn’t calling. Not in that sense, at least. My subconscious was screaming, begging me to get the fuck out of that room through whatever means possible.

*Something is so fucking wrong,* I thought, waiting for Bassel to respond to my pantomiming.

He smiled, but it wasn’t reassuring. The grin was patronizing, revealing his own bitter amusement rather than his willingness to help, like he was watching his cat trying and failing to jump onto a forbidden table.

The man shook his head *no* a few times, and then placed a hand over my scalp, manually twisting my head back in the direction of Akila.

*“Little did we know, however, that in the nick of time, Jom found love. He was scared to divulge his love to us, because she is an outsider, just as Diane was. But, by being here, she has proven herself worthy of Khepri’s embrace, unlike the heretic.”* she said, gesturing a bony hand in my direction, long acrylic nails taking the shape of hawk talons.

*“Tara - we’re very grateful for your love, and your commitment to Jom. As you well know, passionate love is the best conduit. It's easier for Khepri to mold. But, of course, the love of youngest son will do if passionate love isn’t available. All that is to say, I’m sure Horus is very grateful, as well.”*

At that point, my heart was crashing against my rib cage like jackhammer, percussive and relentless. Bassel’s sturdy hand remained on my head, fixing my gaze on Akila.

Because of that, I couldn’t look away when the matriarch turned to face me, detailing what was to be my fate.

*“Your black night, desolate and bare, will draw the death from Jom, granting him renewal.”*

Sweat poured over my body, drenching me with sticky fear.

*“Are you ready, Tara?”*

Another white-clad figure appeared behind Akila, wrenching the heavy lid of the casket open.

Inside, Jom’s desiccated corpse laid flat, arms crossed over his shoulders, naked as the day he was born. But his body only covered half of the available space.

You see, the reason the coffin was so damn large is because it was built to house two separate people. The other half *had* been for Jom’s son, but now it was designated for me.

As if I even needed it confirmed at that point, I noted that the body had both of their hands. My actual assignment had lost one of his during their tour of Vietnam.

Hank had dropped me off on the wrong day.

When I didn’t move towards the casket, paralyzed by fear, Akila spoke into the microphone one more time, sharp static crackling through the speakers again like an electric tongue whipping invisibly through the air.

*“Bassel, it seems like Tara is having a bit of cold feet. Bring her over here, show our conduit how spacious it is inside, next to her beloved.”*

The man’s muscular paw pulled my head up, forcing me to my feet.

I tried to brainstorm even a fragment of an exit strategy, but for the second time that day, Horus broke my concentration.

Somewhere in the back of the room, I heard him snickering under his breath, elated with his good fortune.

1iozu2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1iozu2k/long_term_lip_issue_would_really_appreciate_any/,Long term lip issue - would really appreciate any ideas for curing this or possible next steps.,"Hey everyone,

Apologies for the length of this, I'll do my best to keep it as brief as possible. I've been dealing with a lip issue (Pictures in the comments) that's may or may not be related to acid reflux since late April last year. It all started when I noticed that my lips were started to feel chapped. I assumed it was from too much kissing with a new girl I was seeing but it didn't improve with using chap stick (Burt's Bees, Blistex, Carmex). In fact they got redder and reacted more to the summer heat.

Using Vaseline/Aquaphor would provide a bit of mild relief but they'd also just end up looking greasy. By June I went to the doctor and they proscribed me hydrocortisone cream and anti fungal cream. They seemed to dry out the lips but not remove the swelling or redness. I also did an std urine screening and it was negative.  I visited a dermo in September who told me my lips looked fine and prescribed me elidel which I took for a month. By this time my lips started burning and I revisited the different fungal creams for an entire month - still no help. 

I asked my doctor to try antibiotics and she put me on 40mg doxycline and muporicin for a month. During this time I was in Japan for two weeks but despite change in environment (no mold exposure, no dog, no house plants, new soaps) the issue was still the same.

When I got home in December (presumably after I finished the antibiotics) I started having histamine like reactions to food (ie. flushing on my skin), I'd eat certain things and feel my throat tightening up. I started getting flushing on half of my face from showering, I drank a beer and got a lone ranger like mask around my eyes. If I ate ANYTHING I would feel out of it and have trouble focusing. My back and shoulders felt like they were burning too during this time, especially after meals. 

I did an hpylori blood test and was negative and my doc put me on Pantoprazole 40mg 2x a day. I've also been eating pretty clean since mid-December (chicken/turkey, oat milk, potatoes, broccoli, larabars). I cut out dairy and gluten in Feb and haven't drunk any alcohol or coffee in months (I sneak the occasional coke zero/chai latte for my sanity). I've been on the Pantoprazole for 3 weeks now and have seen some positive improvements in the histamine reactions, flushing, back pain, the feeling out of it and vision issues.

I'm still eating this very mild diet and from what I've read online, if this whole thing is reflux related then it might take a few months to clear up entirely (and fix whatever damage happened to my mouth, sinuses, stomach, esophagus)

The reflux situation would make sense as my lips seem to be missing the skin on the inside of them there are prominent fordyce spots where the top and bottom lips meet. My dad and grandfather also had very bad reflux which they managed with medication. From Jan 2023 - Dec 2024 I would drink a protein shake (whey poweder+milk) after a late evening workout and go straight to bed, so I could see any acid potentially rolling into my mouth and burning my lips/tongue throughout the night. I also wondered if the Iron supplements I was taking throughout 2024 might have been harming my stomach as well.

Anyway, that's my story. I just bought a very uncomfortable wedge pillow to sleep on and I keep waiting for the pantoprazole and diet to suddenly fix this sudden reaction my body is having to food and also whatever happened to my lips. My question, to the doctors and anyone else on here who have thoughts they'd like to contribute - is there anything else I might want to pursue here - anything obvious I've missed? Lip biopsy? Endoscopy of my throat/ stomach? Too much D3 - hypercalcemia? Any timeline expectations I might have regarding the pantoprazole in treating the LPR/Gerd? Any advice would be appreciated. I'd really like to go back to living my life and stop obsessing over this very strange issue that has consumed my every waking moment for the last year.

Things I've done

* Changed out soaps/toothpastes and other facial products for more gentle options. Stopped using soap on my face for months, switched to a mint free, sls free, fluoride free kids toothpaste for months. 
* Used eczema creams such as elidel, tarolimus and fungal and antibiotic creams
* Did a patch test that only showed mild sensitivity to Ammonia Persulfate (hair dye/pool cleaner)
* STD lab - negative
* Hematology lab - normal
* H Pylori lab - negative
* I've cut out things such as water bottles, retainers and other things that seemed like obvious solutions. I've had the aha moment so many times this year and we haven't solved it yet.
* Bought a wedge pillow for sleeping / small acid friendly meals / no snacking after 8pm
* Currently on Pantoprazole 40mg x2

I've tried all of the major brew methods, adjusting all of the variables... but good coffee has become rare and unrepeatable when it does happen.

I started with the Timemore C2 and when I became unsatisfied, I saw the rave reviews for the ZP6 and dove in blind. It's been months and I feel like I'm losing my mind dialing it in. It's either bitter or weak. No in-between.

I noticed that if I bought ground coffee from a store that I could get a decent cup(as good as grocery store coffee gets). This makes me suspect that my issue is the grinder.

Is there a better/more forgiving grinder for me?
I enjoy light roast with fruity/acidity.

V60 and Clever Dripper are what I have now.

I'd really appreciate any input. Feels like I'm losing my mind. It shouldnt be this hard.

Edit for more info:

Beans: Always buy light roasts. Sometimes from Happy Mug Coffee, other times from local places.

Methods: V60, probably tried every popular method on YouTube. Clever Dripper, only tried the Hoffman method. 

Ratios: kind of all over the place. But usually end up doing 20ish grams per 300ml",2,1739498209.0,pourover,36,0.75,False

My wife doesn't never asked them for rent until recently, only to help out with groceries and other household things occasionally while they saved up for a car.

They finally got a car after years of us being forced to drive them everywhere, BUT they now refuses to actually drive it because they bought a clunker out of spite. they also wasted a ton of money buying motorcycle gear, and now don't want to actually buy a motorcycle or get the licence. 

They are constantly buying whole outfits and redoing their entire wardrobe, just completely obsessed with their appearance yet refusing to actually wear most of the items they buy.

They refuse to get the cat they claimed responsibility for fixed, and barely groom her. I feel terrible for the thing and end up doing most of her care myself, on top of our other animals care. 

They are my best friend but I am so tired of feeling like they are forcing themselves to be my child. They aren't 16. We are almost 30.

At least not until the last meal of the day. Ataru noticed a Doll with pink puffy hair and a dress with lipstick. it was getting to his attention when he noticed this it was like he was in a trance. His mother bonked him on the head to get his attention. She asked where he was going to which he responded. ""Cherry tree valley"" which she didn't approve of this but unless it was going to the Markets to get more ingredients than she allowed. It

He was willing to get the cherry tree valley and he was there at that point but when he was the doll again it put him in an even more sharper trance he strongly followed it with out hesitation. Coincidently it was going to cherry tree valley. Ataru was left confused when he was at cherry tree valley at least until he saw the doll again. The doll didn't say anything to him nor did he say anything to it. But it was at that moment that he realized he was here for no reason at least thats what he thought. He analysed the doll to think about what its purposes at that point.

Ataru Moroboshi: "" ugh, there gotta be something to say about this plastic animatronic possessed doll? ""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""though plane and simple (mostly creepy) this cute little doll has the best details i have every seen.""

That was when the doll spined around and around and around and around until it formed an actual person with the same design and organic materials it walked strength to Ataru covering its blushes.  
That shiny long puffy pink hair, that pink maid dress skirt, those smooth BLUE skin, shiny pantyhose legs nets, and that 6 toed feet and stylised blue painted nails, she was about 8 Feet tall but non less beautiful.

???: ""You really think i'm cute? ""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""Also a girl.🙂""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""HELLO AM ATARU RONNY MOROBOSHI, whats your name cutey two feet?""

???: ""Oh!, This is embarrassing.. I'm. m-my name is Ran brau ha ha.""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""Nice to meet you Ran-cha!""

Ran: ""oh and i'm ever so delighted to meet you Ataru, please forgive my poor appearance if i knew i was going to have guests i would have gussied up a bit.""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""i don't mind i like girls like you.""

Ataru shook her hand little too hard and as a result pulled her arm out of her body and he was shocked as a deer on headlights, bugged eyed and pale in shamed. But Ran assured him. ""Uh Oh, it looks like my arm feel off again, No problem, no problem at all no need to feel ashamed."" She grabbed her arm from him and placed it back where it belongs. ""See no problem at all, i'm fine, sorry i startled you."" Ataru ashamed but forgave ""oh, it's quite alright. . sorry i was afraid of it...""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""So Ran-Cha, do you like nice walks in the park, cause i know i perfect place we can spend our weekend together.

Ran:"" (cute giggle) Ataru, your such a gentlemen. ""

\[Intro\]

The prison gates open at its been a while to be in a pickle all this time for 50 years frozen in ice until they were greeted by 3 girls frozen in ice for 100 years the dappy-men had been planning this since the day Lum finished them of but now they were going to get Revenge and get Lum's horns one way or another.

Dappy-men: ""all right suger girls its bed time is up.""

Meanwhile  
Lum was in her U.F.O bed, sleeping with the stars in space. Until she felt some distress but it wasn't coming from her it was coming from somewhere on earth she floated down to see what the problem was and as she thought there was a fire coming from the hospital, she rushed as fast as she could to save the patients and a mother's baby who almost feel in dangerous chemicals the baby thought she was her mother but when Lum brought her to her real mother she immediately cried.

Lum went back to her U.F.O until she felt another connection it was coming from somewhere at the beach when a massive hurricane was destroying the frame of the east cost in Hawaii, many people were getting hurt until Lum pushed the Hurricane back with her bare hands and absorbed the remaining energy from it. The whole world thought this was a prank but when they realized it wasn't they began to feel a little safe but weirded out.

Lum went back to her U.F.O until she felt another connection, but this time it wasn't coming from the Earth it was coming from 200,63 light years away. A Alien race that was being terrorised by giant tentacle monsters and king Ghidorah? (the three headed monster?). Ok ghidorah she could handle but for the tentacles she needed her military Force there was too much slime to handle from that.

Lum was just going through the town hoping she wouldn't have to save another soul she felt a fumiller thought that felt safe yet threating she couldn't just feel it she could hear it that she remembered a fumiller it was like it was talking to her but it wasn't talking to her it was monologuinge it it said with a BLACK passion.

""after this plan i'll be even with THEM i shall, i sewer, and when am done with her the whole universe will cease to be a problem. ""

Lum almost went into tears by that word and said in a clam scared tone ""Ran-cha?"" She was distracted by another feeling calling out in agony in which she couldn't hesitate to go forth for.

The next morning Shinbou was getting ready for the day. Taking a shower, brushing her teeth, doing her prying to the cross. But when she went down stairs she saw Lum sleeping on her couch and her parents oddly surprised and confused. Lum woke up to go into the kitchen and get herself a cup of cold coffee. Her parents were imprised about how strong and soft she is to them last night, they searched the house for an intruder until they stumbled upon Lum laying on the couch it was about 5 days since she ever woke up. They didn't call the police in which she put shinbou's father in a trance of comfort because of her face but her mother saw her body in which it would't be healthy for her husband to look at such a glorious body. So she dragged him to her room and put some blankets on her so she wouldn't get cold (and she wouldn't be exposed) but right now shes was even more tired then 4 days earlier. Shinbou asked Lum  
""What are you doing in my house?"" Lum didn't answer that question she only gave her a newspaper of Tomobiki Times in which she read the head lineing

Shinbou: ""Nuni?, ""Invader girl saves family from drowing?"", ""Invader girl guarded our guard dogs"", ""sistar sisters?!"" ""Invader girl sang my autistic mother a song?"", And its not just Japan its almost halfway around the world. Wow Lum's been busy.""

Lum grabbed her shirt like a wild animal while coffee beans were dripping from her mouth.

Lum: ""you have no idea Shinbou! I felt your confusion all the way through my horns i can feel still remember your mother putting a blanket on me very kind of you!"" '

Shinbou 's mother: ""but you were asleep were you awake during all of that pampering?""

Lum: ""oh no no no. I was asleep i had a feeling somebody put something warm and *fuzzy on me back*, there was almost a bad storm i ate it! I have super Link and i think- I think its because of my overactive purperty i still have purperty or -or i have a (film) THEORY that my parents both had a simpler link and i inherited that which made my Link even stronger then they're! I can feel every one and Shinbou, Shinbou,Shinbou..  
They have issues man..-CHA?!""

Shinbou could sense a bit of fear inside of Lum (guess those weeks with Sakura really paid off uh?) She was starting to get the feeling that Lum was being threatened by someone she didn't explain yet. So she tried to ease her mentality by asking. ""Have you been asleep much buddy?😅"" to which Lum replied :""not for a few weeks. ""

Lum: ""but, thats not important i felt her, i read her mind.""

Shinbou: ""read who 's mind?""

Lum: ""Ran-cha""

Shinbou: ""Whos Ran-cha?""

Lum: ""Oh, shes just an old friend a very kind gentle soul. Ya know we used to live together at one point but it was only for a year maybe two months before or after. We used to have such a good time together as kids until that ""Day""... But thats all in the past, but now shes here i know she is she somehow broke out of prison and now the suger gang are relesed from oyuki's eternal slumber for them, and every other person who has ever touch or threatened our kind? shes here on Earth and shes planning something i can't stop until i find her.""

Shinbou: ""ok this is alot for a Friday um mabye we could just go to school and... UH Ataru i almost forgot!""

Shinbou ran out of the house to search for ataru, The tv flashed up when she saw the vampire girl and the boy bash heads, vampire girl mostly annoyed by the fact that she worried that the boy wasn't coming so she thought of new ways to punish him with thought that she hasn't thought of yet so she did a little dance putting her fists up like she was boxing until she could think of something. Lum's only response to this was "" you have ""Tokimeki tonight "" on your planet? Never mind i'll catch up (after twenty-five hours of this show). ""

Meanwhile:

Shinbou went to cherry tree valley only because she had a feeling that Ataru was here when she did meet Ataru, Ataru grabbed her before she could grab him Ataru went to blessing Shinbou by introducing her to Ran.

Ataru Moroboshi: ""Shinbou, i want you to meet my friend Ran-cha!""

Ran: ""oh its very nice to meet you Shinbou...""

Ran blew a kiss at Shinbou to which Shinbou was kinda flattered but also offended by but she was in no position to judge so she said. ""The feelings mitral Ran-cha.""



Shinbou was also stalling so she could get Ataru home it was very important that she did but Ran wasn't going to take that lightly she said with hesitation.

Ran: ""Ataru, wait DON'T GO.""

Ran felt so desperate that a U.F.O of her own was summoned to this specific location

it came down like an eagle starting to land on its nest in this sense it land on her, Shinbou and, Ataru. Ran was more concerned over the fact that Ataru was about to leave her sight not the fact that she was in a cranky position but when she turned on the power. It felt like they were in a beach because it gave forth the apprence of a beach.

Ataru Moroboshi: ""(gasp) Ran-cha this is Amazing.""

Ataru jumped in the pool it felt like actual water because it was water real H2O with high viscosity Ataru wanted Shinbou to join him and she was willing to until Ran turn off the power in which turned off the light and the only sound Shinbou made was a \*crash bang\* Ran turned on the power in which turned on the lights so now Ataru was having more sharper trance then he did originally.

  
Ran: ""oh, Ataru i do hope you enjoyed your swim.""

As soon as she said that the were transported out side well not in cherry tree valley at least, it was in a specific location a forest where a camp was and the space.Ship was transported with them. All of them in one place after another it was on a big hill where the little bunny roam this was very interesting for Shinbou (at least for the ""bunny"" part) Ataru didn't really care at all he was just ready to have some fun with Ran.

Ran: ""would you like a little spin dry.""

Ataru didn't hesitate and he peeled out like blue streak, he ran so fast he could taste the clouds and its water drops looks like spring was coming early. Ran jumped of the hill and floated into Ataru's arms, Shinbou was going to follow them but the Ran's spaceship created some kind of frequency that turned the green grass into green cactus in which Shinbou felt all the things including the hands. But she was strong enough to Run through them she was still in pain but she tryed to ignore it to get at Ran.

Shinbou: ""what happened first i was leaping of flowers and now thorns, there better be a good explanation for this.""

Ran: ""well, you see Shinbou i you see -i.""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""Shinbou be more sensitive. We need to be gentale of our new friend.""

Ran: ""you really view me as a friend?😳""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""(serious tone) Ran-cha i would never have Never seen a better Woman then you most beautiful, Most charming woman i have ever seen.""

Ran: ""(Strong Blush, little nose bleed)""

Shinbou: ""\*Eck Heem, (fake Cough)""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""Oh, Shinbou! YOUR The first Charming, Most beautiful woman😅.""

Ran: ""Ataru no has ever said such things to me..before.. Ataru is it ok that i call you. ""**DARLING**"" .""

Ataru Moroboshi: "" ""Darling?"" I like it has a nice ring to it (in fact it Rings a Bell to me just hearing it. kinda annoying and scary, don't know why, it almost reminds me of, No!, could it?).

Ataru Moroboshi: ""Ran i don't know how this day could get any better.""

Ran: ""(cute chuckle) i do❤.""

Ran hovered a little to hear space ship and brought Shinbou with them the landed on top of the space ship and as it was floating to the it sended them to the Milky Way galaxy. Alk they saw was pure beauty just like Ran, it was a little weird that they could breathe in space wity out a space helmet.

Shinbou: ""hey Ran, how come we're in space we can talk, sing, dance, but not explode?""

Ran: ""Welcome to the future.""

(Pause)

Ran: ""So Darling what do you think?""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""Ran, i have seen a lot of places in my trials, but yours takes the cake the frosting and the cherry on top!""

Ran: ""Oh, DARLING. Hearing you say that melts my already molten core. Here! Have another.""

The blasted through space to see multiple universes in other places until they Returned to Earth for a good purpose. They were equally good and bad but Ran was just getting started.

Ran: ""oh Darling, i can't tell you how simply wonderful it's been to have **you** here, you make me feel like a newly formed lady, today was the Big Bang all over again.""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""thank you Ran-cha we had fun to right Shinbou.. Shinbou?""

Shinbou was leaving the place it was at that moment that she was going back home to see how Lum doing.  
Ataru Moroboshi: ""Shinbou where are you going?""

Shinbou: ""i'm, am going to hear back home. see you tomorrow Ataru.""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""Good Night! Well Ran i have until tomorrow.""

Ran: ""You know Today doesn't have to End you could Stay.""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""thats a great idea! I'll stay tonight and then tomorrow.""

Ran: ""well that settles it then.""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""See you tomorrow Ran-cha!""

Ran: "" But **there will be no Tomorrow for you..**""



Meanwhile:  
Lum after finishing 2 days of Tokimeki tonight she went to search for the the Girl trio she could feel their presents somewhere on Earth.

Lum: "" ok Girls where are you? ""

Random Aliens: \* ""no No please no."" "" Their coming""., ""a coming""., ""i'm Cuming!"", ""Sorry, Sorry!""

Sugar: ""What do you mean you lost them.""

Spice: ""its an advice code scratch i can't figure it out in time!""

Dappy-men: ""We need to know her whereabouts.""

Lum was confused she knew the arguments of the dappy-men wasn't coming about her it was coming from someone else she didn't know who until she got distracted by a sense of distress to a bit of surprise it was a little girl with brown hair with pearl hairstyled and wore a red blue dress and a yellow purse ,she was looking for her mom. Lum could help but know what was going on so she flyed down to see her.

????: ""Mommy where are you? I can't find you.""

Lum: ""Hey there.""

???: ""(gasp)!""

Lum: ""Hey its ok, my name is ""LUM"" whats your name?""

Mako: ""Ma-Mako.""

Lum: ""Don't worrie Mako we'll find your mother.""

Lum carried Mako on her back she flyed her to a specific location her parents where trying their hardest to find thier' s daughter expect for the father who was being in a pickle and being to throw a fit over the fact that his daghter was missing, the mother was about to cry in hopelessness until Lum came down and brought Mako to her mother. They rejoyed over lum's kindness and earged her to stay she was willing to but that disiction was cut short of a Tomobiki Times reporter on the radio.

Tomobiki Times (O.S): ""We just had reports of an invisible person roaming around in japan if you see strange floating objects walking away from you or at high speeds towards you then your homes are being haunted.""

Lum: "" ""invisible person?"" SUGAR.

Lum followed the link towards sugar but she wasn't like before her invisibility was more frequent her own dynasty was being faster then before always going certain directions. only positive side was she had a short memory loss. she could use her talent properly after that last show down. Lum followed her foot steps but the were fading the moment she blinked it was like she had a new technique but didn't know how to use them she was running so fast she could send a frequency that was tampering with Lum's super link and was strongly hurting her. She slamed to the ground in tiredness she could get to her in time before sugar got away. She may not be able to use her super link but she had other senses she could hear her foot steps of child playing in the blocks, people going to Beef bowl, and Sugar tripping over mud puddles. She finally cought sugar by the hair and she \[Sugar\] punch 3 times before tiring out.

Lum: ""stop am not trying to hurt you!""

Sugar: ""Let me go i need to save my sisters!""

Lum: ""Your sisters, what happened to them?""

Sugar: ""They Froze us after you guys ruined our game plan spice got away, but they got Pepper and Ginger, they tholled us out and took us to Earth with OTHER aliens i found out their planning on invading earth in an unknown date. If you don't break them out now you can kiss this planet good-bye. You can do what every you want with me after just let me spring my sisters out first.""

Lum: ""I can't allow that. Not alone if you tell me everything you know i'll help you get them back but thats it.""

The Dappy-men moved the ice blocks from Neptune to a mother ship it flow before Lum and Sugar could catch it, it was almost to late until Lum grabbed Sugar by the hand and shot across the sky at full speed running in the sky like she was jumping off of clouds. Lum was head to the nearest window she opened it but then a snake head reached out and grabbed her body as they were tumbling down sugar grabbed a hammer and banged Lum's head in with it ginger came in with a mechanized Feline Suit From her home planet (very durable). The reached the grass like a big mentor.

Ginger: ""Gotcha! Did you really think we let a moron like you beat us that easily. ""

All the girl gamg came to play and surrounded Lum spice, the newbie, shoot a sound wave at her sending her to the Tomobiki school tree. Lum was getting smothered left and right ginger giving her a great bear hug and pepper tuning into a giant serpent and beginning to bite off her head but lum didn't take this easy she felt all the feeling now and when she did she turned into something **Unforgettable.**



Super Charged her hair turned electric and her power now advice beginning to from the biggest shock wave known to Man sending them tumbling into the aira alone, taring apart ginger's BRAWN BOOSTER SUIT, throwing pepper into the air, giving spice a taste of her own medicine, and banging Sugar on the head.  
When they were all knocked out. Lum could feel a link again but this one seemed more hostile and Aggressive. Knowing it belong to she rushed to cherry tree valley knowing someone wasn't hesitating from her grasp.

Meanwhile:

At Ran's spaceship

Ataru woke up in Ran bed ran was just about to wake Ataru for a special breakfast

Ran: ""Good morning my wonderful Darling❤.""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""good morning Ran-cha.""

Ran: ""Hey have you seen Shinbou anywhere?""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""oh, she went for a swim and then a hick and then went back home.""

Ran: ""(thats good)- oh, i mean that too bad she was going to miss out on all the good stuff oh well. That means more alone time with just us.""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""Just wait till you meet Lum! If theres one thing i know about Lum, shes cunning, organised, watches me like an Eagle in the sky! ( kind of disturbing actually.)""

Ran violently flintched during the name ""LUM"" in which she tryed to changed the subject about her mother but Ataru kinda got the feeling that Lum and her felt kinda familiar mabye they knew each other. So Ran shoved a ton of flapjacks into Ataru mouth to get him to shut up. But Ataru had a question Shinbou was waiting to ask Ran but could't think of the right time so she asked ataru to deliver that massage but Ran interrupted him by a sense of fishery a cake that had noticeble needles with green ooze dripping out. But Ataru began to drip the message Shinbou gave him.

Ataru Moroboshi: ""thats nice Ran but i have a question did you know Lum at one point were you two friends?""

That was when Ran snapped and hair shoted out and her teeth turned into cat fangs and her eye shrunk to a certain degree and her mind was going in rage.

Ran: "" **Lum Lum Lum?! Do you what i've been through to get here, i done everything i was suppose to i clean, am smart am, beautiful and now everyone thinks am the Joke. I am more important than anybody has every known. I tried to be nice but i never get anything back always getting punished, hurt and killed making life their plaything. MY LIFE ISN'T SOMETHING YOU CAN THROW AWAY! WHEN WILL I HAVE RESPECT, WHEN WILL PEOPLE, LOVE WHEN WILL I BE LOVED, the World is sick and cruel and all they did was hurt me, did so many mean times i suffered in this world! You don't know the things they have done to me and i hate you! I** hate everybody... You don't understand.. They're so. so mean so...😢""

Ataru noticed Ran agony on the floor as tears went down her eyes Ataru confort ran despite her bitter outburst on the other hand he really just wanted to get some sugar.

Ataru Moroboshi: ""Ran i can't believe you had to go through all of that, i can't believe they did that to you. actually i can totally believe it! Your not the only one who has to suffer ya know.""

Ran: ""Oh, you must of heard all about me. **I don't want your damn pitty you stupid -**

Ataru Moroboshi:"" wait thats not what i meant! YOU DESERVE A BETTER FRIEND😟. ""

Ran paused and just looked at ataru and dropped down to the floor in total anger and sadness she couldn't fatham her feelings its like all she wanted was to die now. But Ataru took her by the hand and lifted her up she looked at him as if it was the first time somebody did that for her.

Ataru Moroboshi: ""i wish there was some was to ease your pain.""

Ran: ""How about a Kiss.""

Ataru Moroboshi: ""😍 !""

Ran: ""Just you and me darling?""

Ataru Moroboshi: "" (You know what they say: ""a man has to take a chance or hes not a Man at all.) ""

Ataru was getting kinda nervous about the situation that being said but he could kiss her until he closed his eye in which she was expecting him to do. He was about to aim for the lips until Lum came down to them calling Ataru's name. That was when they saw each other with tears down their eyes they ran to each other in a warm embrace and dance around together like a family reunion and then Hugged each other even stronger, each other with a tender smiles. Lum flied Ran to a near by tree, like a Lois and Clark thing, where they were alone they holded hands.

Lum: ""i can't believe it Ran it is you!""

Ran: ""am so happy you're here Lum.😢""

Lum: ""But why are you here? Shouldn't you be back home by now?""

Ran: ""Well you see i was going to go back but when i heard you we're moving to another planet called Earth i just could't live with out you.""

Lum: ""the same with you! But that look your doing with your face is kinda creepy why not be the real you?""

Ran: ""oh, its hard to fit in now that am learning to shape-shift i just got to get used to these fangs sticking out.""

Lum: ""Well, you don't have to be an Alien to do that, its a good thing you can just disuse yourself as a human, you wouldn't want anybody to know your an alien that would be dangerous.""

Ran: ""Ya, know i've been thinking about that too... I searched for you ever since your last invasion i went to your parents, your friends, benten. but nobody knew where you were. But when i heared about the NEWS about an on going ""Invader GIRL"" i just knew it had to be you Lum-cha there is no other person on this planet who can Control the storm as well as you. and i have been sent here on leaving me to rot in a cold place they know i have a problems they just don't care. ""

Lum: "" oh, that reminds me, have you ever tied the knot with anyone? ""

Ran: ""That's priceless coming from the likes of you. You spend all your time here instead of caring for your friends. You think its so easy to live life the way you want while the rest of us have to sleep in the sewers, in this world. Am busting my Ass just so i can provide for myself and i can't even do that. While you live your best life with your special Darling...""

Lum: ""Ran stop that, me and Ataru are just friends i only came so that i cou-

Ran:"" Really Lum because i do recall you saying you had a Deep link with him i should of Dealt with him when i had the chance!.. ""

Lum: "" Ran where is this coming from your not the girl i used knew from elementary? ""

Ran: ""See, thats the problem you always do things without thing of the consequences, but never once can you take a hint about how other people feel. Do you know how sickening that is?""

Lum:"" Ran, Uh? How is you're mother & your (weird) baby Brother? ""

Ran: ""**Don't** change the subject. You have a all your these things in your perfect life and what do i get? A piece a of trash lying on the ground! Life is so unfair and i-i!""

Lun: ""But ran I-mate

Ran: ""**HELL WITH IT!, YOU KNOW I CAME HERE TO TAKE MY ANGER OUT ON A BUNCH OF STRANGER BUT NOW THAT YOUR HERE! I HAVE MORE REASON TO SET THIS WORLD ABLAZE!""**

Lum: ""What!""



Ran: ""**THATS RIGHT, AM GOING TO KILL EVERYONE ON THIS DAMN PLANET! AND SINCE YOUR HERE YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE MY SIGHT A-AGAIN YOU'LL STAY WITH ME WON'T YOU?""**

Lum: ""No Ran this is wrong ! You can't ask me to something so selfish to people! sorry but i have to put our meeting to a close!""

Ran: ""well if you won't stay with me then than! **I'LL MAKE YOU STAY!**""

Ran tried to used the element of surprise and tried to kiss lum in the sense that she was trying to suck out her free will and take it for herself. Lum tried to push her off all she could but she was too sticky and they both tumbled down the tree Ran grabbed hold of lum's leg severely scratching them in a sense of madness both knocked down the branches and tree stumps until Lum landed in Ataru arms. Ataru wondering what was going on Looked at ran motionless body and began running towards her in a desperate time. Ran got up and took an axe that shredded a whole tree stump she chased after them in a total sense of madness both of them stumbling down a hill, into the streets where the children play all the way back to Ataru's house but lum caught up to them. Ran was wielding the axe at Ataru and then Lum, Lum used her electric shock to stun Ran and knocked her down leaving her unconscious. Lum took Ran to a secured location. When Ran regain consciousness she found herself near a body of water where she was dusting sand of her dress. She called to lum, but lum didn't answer although she looked at her once she never said a word back so Lum left her there on the deserted island where she could get herself together and think about what shes done.

Ataru was having a sever problem with his mother like he wasn't home for the 2nd day this week and it was already sunday at this point although he made it just in time to the get together he didn't get the ingredients he swore to get in which he was being punished for. Lum had other problems mainly the girl gang still out there looking for someone strong enough to beat her. But also how Ran acted this wasn't like her, it wasn't at all the Ran she used to know she didn't know where these things were coming from somewhere out there she hopes Ran is doing just fine.



Epilogue:

Baby Lum: ""Hey ran!""

Little Ran: ""Lum!""

Baby Lum: ""Wanna play?""

Lum age 700 and Ran age 700 they walked though out the land meeting new people , trying new foods having a good time. One of those particular days Ran was being bullied by a wild beast and was about to finish her off until Lum came in and started shooting it with her lazer gun amusingly killing it (but it was still alive just unconscious). Ran went into Lum's arms she cryed while lum tried to comfort her by singing to her. when she was finished she promised Ran she would always be there for her she didn't have to be afraid. And that was the last time Lum had ever broken a promise again.

**The End?**

Shades of coffee have what seems like just the top part of the boiler (not the group head bottom part) for $400+ aud. For an extra $400-450 I could get a brand new E24 gaggia and ideally i would want both halves of the brass boiler right? 
Other sites have it in stock but don’t ship to Australia.
I cleaned my boiler the other day and i feel like its due for a replacement but i dont know if i want to get an alloy replacement due to boiler gate? 

I figure if i am going give my machine a freshen up i may aswell get something relatively future proof. 

Any ideas or suggestions welcome!

I thought he was cute and I never told my friend about him and then a week later, I almost crashed into him, couple days later we cross path on the stairs. From then on, I think I developed a crush without knowing every time he would come into the library I would notice him. I would notice when he’s with his friends when he’s alone, no matter where he was. I found myself looking forward to going to the library on the days that he was there just to see him till this day. I’ve always accepted the fact that this may be a one-sided thing that he never noticed me however, one day I went to a coffee shop and he was already there and I could feel his eyes on me. I’m shy so I could not make eye contact with him so I didn’t and my delusional brain just Snowball into a full on crush and think that there’s a possibility that he might have noticed me too. I still don’t know his name so I know it’s a surface level crush and I did not see him for a while (2 months) , so I thought I was over the crush. Fast-forward to last week I saw him again and my crush just came back like it never went away and then I saw him again today. I just can’t help but wish that I knew his name or that I could read mines because if I knew for sure that he liked me, I think I would approach him. So here I am writing on Reddit hoping that with this venting session I can let go once and for all cause I don’t think this is healthy. I just can’t help but think I’m crazy. Like I said I don’t even know this guy‘s name. I don’t know what his voice sounds like. All I know is that he is very quiet and very studious and that he’s cute. I also started writing a short story about him. Hopefully, that will help me get over this crush. ",2,1739497758.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1iozjlc,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeeadvocate/comments/1iozjlc/philz_coffee_silken_splendor_the_real_review_this/,Philz Coffee Silken Splendor (the real review this time),"I'm here to fix my blunder! The true review of Silken Splendor has come. This is a great accessible blend to start new reviews with, and I quite like Philz in general and highly recommend - as far as big companies go. I've actually had Silken Splendor several times before and I have been wanting to review it. I mistakenly wrote this in the title in the review for Philtered Soul...so here we are with the proper Silken Splendor.

  
Look - Beans are round, uniform in size. Shiny beans, no silver skin. They are fairly dark for a medium roast, maybe on the medium-dark part of the spectrum. The grounds take on a lighter appearance, looking strikingly similar to cocoa nibs or carob. When brewed, the coffee takes on a chocolatey-caramel color. It looks similar to good spiced black tea. This coffee also takes milk very well. When adding unsweetened soy milk, about a tablespoon, I get a nice medium brown color that is Goldilocks style not too dark but not too light. Looks similar to a chai latte, actually.

Aroma - When unground, the beans have an interesting scent mix of smokey cocoa with a nuttiness, lightly sweet floral vanilla, and a spiciness. When ground, the beans open up to more sweet maple and caramel mixed with that spiciness still lingering there on the back end of the scent. Brewed, the coffee smells lovely. Chocolately, caramelly, and a citrus fruit sweetness with a floral ""spice"".

Taste - When black, the coffee is caramelly and staight to the point with a zing of citrus and light bitterness on a short finish. Well rounded coffee that can easily be taken black. However, I did add some unsweetened soymilk. I feel this was a good pairing for this blend as it brought out an orange note much more. You don't need a lot of milk...really you don't need any - and certainly not sugar. What I thought would be on the bolder side ended up being pretty sweet with a very light acidic zing.

Feel - Medium-light body. Not too heavy and a short finish. The coffee does a good job of coating your mouth but it doesn't stay too long. I taste almost no aftertaste which is fine. The lightest bit a tannin-esque dryness on the sides of my tongue, but isn't too noticeable (more like, you notice it but it is easy to forget because it is so light and is fleeting).



Overall, this kind of reminds me of the stereotypical ""breakfast blend"" coffees you see at grocery stores. I don't know if that's what Philz was going for, but I will say this is a good blend and can easily replace those breakfast blends. There are interesting mixes in the aroma and flavor notes that I think work well. It isn't too complex and doesn't overstay its welcome...however I do think the finish could be a bit longer. Then again, I brewed this on french press so maybe using the traditional Philz pour-over would yield different results. I somehow doubt it considering how many flavor oils are kept when using a french press. Anyways, I enjoyed it. Good aromas, good mouth feel, good taste. I think this could work both as a morning/afternoon cup or with dessert. Go light on the creamer/milk!

Look - 5

Smell - 4.5

Taste - 4.25

Feel - 5

Overall - 4.5

So this guy(18/19) has been with me through kindergarten, primary and middle school(age 5-15) and he had always been a bit different from the others, has psychosis or something im not sure.

2-3 years later, sometimes when i went on walks id walk past him and smile but he seemed not to like that too much so i stopped that, but now today in the grocery store i see him and he smiles at me and walks towards me which i found a bit surprising since he has never ever talked to me. He kind of makes an effort to do small talk but then he tells me that he basically has no friends, is depressed, been bullied since he can remember and in 2023 he wrote letters incase he would leave and dedicated the letters to 4 people. I was one of them. 

How can that even be possible? I have never talked to him before, only thing ive done is smile to him and not bullied him. I comforted him and hugged him, still very stunned. He said he wanted to meet me on Sunday for coffee or something and in the confusion i said yes.

Can someone please tell me whats best to do in this situation, this is so out of the blue that i cant even process what happened honestly. thank you

1iozihx,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1iozihx/new_in_this_journey/,New in this journey.,"Hi, I started trying to lose weight on January 2025 after make the realization that I cannot do all the things I wanted to do I this body. On top of the cherry when I weight myself I got 345 being 5’11” M. I was not weighed myself basically in years.  This is what I started to do:

1. Reduce the portions of my carbs in my meals. Especially rice I try to use 1 cup per meal (Culturally in my country we eat a lot of rice so basically all my meals have rice).

2. Incorporate salads to balance the rice I cut. 

3. Intermittent fasting 16/8. In summer of the past year I started to take unicity and after to month I left it. But I create the habit of not taking breakfast. So now I try to eat my dinner before 7 pm and I lunch on 11 am. 

4. Started to excercise in the mornings. Basically I started to get up 1 hour early (5:10 am). To try to do an routine without impact like this: https://youtu.be/st6ZyWhoP5M?si=NS2n8EGjPwnUs16z. Because my knees started tu hurt if I do a routing with impact. 
 
5. Try to walk more. Usually I do not move any inch. So I set a daily goal of at least 10k steps. With 8k I’m more that happy. Basically I try to move more trough the office. On launch time I go to a walk and buy a coffee. And this week I try to started walking in the nights in the park until I meet the goal. 

Seven weeks later I lost 15 pounds and I’m very happy with that. All that things I mention I try to started one by one because I know if I do all this things at once I would not last 1 week.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1739497350.0,Needafriend,2,1.0,False

I work. I **REDACTED**. I get up early on Saturday so I can knock out my chores before noon. Food, lightly salted, dressing… on the side. And beer….. once every few weeks. Yeah it’s like that as an aging dude. So if you are hoping to find someone who like doing his Pilates while on  mushrooms at burning man………  you’re going to be disappointed talking to me. The most exciting thing I have done recently Is install rain catchment for my garden. Every trip I have taken in the last year was for work.

I am a single male. Never married and no kids and never want any of my own. This is reddit. We will likely never meet. Not even for a coffee even if I try to bribe you with home made pastries. I am sure my dry texting and one dimensional personality will do wonders for your insomnia. Would I like to date, yes, but let’s be realistic. Good conversation is probably the best we can ask for on reddit. I work from home and the weekly online DnD sessions aren’t really socially holding me over. 

Living on the west coast. Working one of those office jobs where I spend the day dreaming of making a living building furniture. I love music, and even play music. Maybe one day I will stop being a wuss and actually perform. NO. I don’t play DAD rock. So I will not talk your ear off about the importance of Punk Music or why some drummer is underrated. I am back in school, or more like I never really left. I am one of those people who take classes as a hobby. However I am trying to make a career change. I am a big fan of used book stores, thrift stores, galleries and museums. Yes, I have eReader but, a physical books just the business. If a cat or a dog comes up to me, I will pet it, if it let’s me. Does anyone like bird watching? Let’s find out once and for all if they ARE REAL or secret government drones. I workout and I actually enjoy it. I have my creatine and protein powder. I’m trying to learn Spanish. I am a workaholic at the moment as I am trying to make changes in my life. I see this ending soon and would like to travel and recreate more.  I haven’t had a passport in over a decade, I am severely under traveled, and I would like to change that. 

I am an atheist and very left learning. Just putting that out there for those in which this matters. I canvassed for Harris and have no shame in saying I’ve done so. I am pretty open and do not require you to be just like me. I care about the environment. Climate Change is indeed anthropogenic.  I have been trying to get more active and reached out to organizations like the Sierra Club. I am very atheist. Never “lost my faith” since I never had it. No. I am not even spiritual.  Am I terrified right now? Yes. I have lost sleep over current events and what the future may hold. 

What am I looking for. You? I am sure you’re pretty cool, fun and interesting. Drop in. Tell me about yourself. Tell me about something that excites or fascinates you. Again. Dry texter so bear with me. I kinda hate using my phone, hence the dry texting. Come at me with your book or podcast recommendations. Got volunteer or activism suggestions? Tell me. Voice chats are heavily encouraged. I am open to anything from one time chats all the way to dating. I am not trying to put pressure on anyone or micromanage our interactions.

Sorry for the long story but it needs some backstory. 

My partner (m 47) has a 16 year old girl. We live together along with my 2 girls (11 and 9) and have for 3 years. My SD is 50/50 on a not great schedule - she is here for 4 days and then at her mom's for 4 days as my partner is a first responder and that's his shift schedule. They have been on this schedule since they separated 9 years ago. My partner is an excellent, involved, caring dad who is a true 50% of everything including the emotional labour type.  He and BM have a low conflict relationship. 

My SD goes to school in the town where her mom lives. Our house, in the city, is a 30 minute drive from the town/her school/etc. All of her friends and her activities are all in that town. At the time they separated neither my partner nor BM lived in that town, although my SD went to school there. When they separated, BM moved to that town, and my partner moved to the edge of the city near the town. 

Driving, activities, etc., in the town have been an issue forever. My partner is really good about taking her to almost everything she wants to do, but he wants her to plan things to condense his waiting time if possible, and sometimes he just says no (especially if it's the day after a 24 hour shift).   She hates this, and expresses that she didn't choose to have her school and activities and social life there, and sort of I think considers it his duty as a parent to take her to everything because he's the one that chose to live further away. That sounds a bit spoiled but I can understand where she is coming from, having very little control over her life. This problem has gotten worse lately because she has recently gotten her driver's licence, but she hasn't practiced enough yet to go on the high traffic commuter highway from the city to her school (and is not safe when she is practicing), although she is fine to drive around the town or in general anywhere that's not on that highway. She is also extremely mad about this since she believes that passing licencing means she can drive everywhere full stop. We are working on her practicing as much as possible to get her comfortable, but it's also been snowing here for a month, which has limited the ability to practice. The reason why she needs this practice is because she did not ever practice this part of the drive in the two years that she had her learner's licence because she did not want to as it was too scary and stressful. Anyway, she is very resentful at the moment about this whole situation, which again I can totally understand from a developmental perspective from her point of view, but also I do not believe that we can do anything other than what we are doing from a safety perspective.  

So my partner was in the town today waiting for my SD during the school day and he bumped into BM at a coffee shop. They started chatting and BM told him that my SD doesn't want to live with us anymore, she wants to live with BM full time but she doesn't want to hurt our feelings. Obviously this has set off a lot of chaos, and we are struggling for the right response here. To make this more complex, my partner and SD are leaving for a 10 day vacation together tomorrow. 

So how do we respond? Some things that we have preliminarily discussed or discussed in the event that this happens are - my partner moves to the town until she is done high school, really get this driving thing going and see if that makes a difference, be more flexible generally so she doesn't feel like she's letting anyone down if she doesn't spend exactly 4 days here, let her just do it, etc. Does anyone have any insight or ideas about how to respect her age, her need for independence and autonomy, balanced against maintaining as much connection as possible? She's a teenager but setting the teenage aside, she's a great kid, does well in school, is responsible, etc.     ",2,1739496734.0,blendedfamilies,6,1.0,False

She shows a grocery too up because that’s what normal people do. It’s full of junk and chocolate bars “in case Salah runs out of chocolate bars.” He’s a fucking adult. She acts like not having chocolate bars in the house is like running out of coffee. All the while she’s clearly lying and coming up with reasons why Salah locks her out of his bedroom. Oh, and hilariously, she tried to pretend that she goes in to clean because you know how man caves are, amirite???? She’s so stupid, it’s great. 

She was gross and vulgar about Yaba and Sam and apparently Chantal is the only one to care about cats, she has insider knowledge that nobody in GW gives to charity.

They went out to the depressing bus parking lot beside their beachside condo pied-à-terre to dump food on the ground and Salah got some great footage. Looks like that first picture is not filtered. 

Then he took his prized hog to the pool where he wiped her face and petted her fucking head, like a child you don’t know but were forced to console. That’s the third picture but I had a hard time capturing it. 

They then go on to say every day is Valentine’s Day and he loves her so much and blah blah. She looks very annoyed but she’s struggling to catch her breath from walking. It’s so believable.

1ioz750,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ioz750/seeking_resources_for_primarily_inattentive_type/,Seeking resources for Primarily Inattentive type,"Pretty much what the title says. I'm an almost 42 year old man just diagnosed with primarily inattentive type in November of last year. I'm on my 3rd drug trial to see if anything actually helps me out. Didn't like the generics for Adderall xr or Focalin xr, trying ritalin ir generic as of today, but so far not impressed. I'm starting to think stimulants aren't going to help me at all, they just make me a tired zombie and I can't concentrate on anything AND feel like shit. Super fun.

Anyway, when I google around looking for things that I can try to do to help make my brain work the way I want it to, I mostly find articles that seem to be geared more toward the hyperactive type. I already have no fewer than 20 alarms going off on a given day, have multiple to do lists for both personal and business stuff (todoist, trello, clickup, google keep, etc.) I have 3 whiteboards around the house, I try to lock my phone up in a different room when I need to be working (currently trying to work from home in my own business), I'm sure there's other stuff too, just what's coming to mind.

My biggest struggles at the moment I would say are executive function, time blindness, poor focus (until it becomes hyperfocus for reasons), and overall just low energy. It takes me like 3 hours from the time I wake up to just get it together and get to work, it's incredibly annoying and affecting my relationship with the gf since I'm always working late due to getting such a late start. Caffeine has similar contradictory effects like the prescription stimulants. I mostly stick to tea during the week, coffee makes me a wreck.

Hoping people with some similar issues might be able to point me in the right direction of some resources that are a little more geared towards my type.

He was asking me what I did for work, which is fine. Then asked me how long I'd been in this town, which is a bit weirder but fine. And then he started asking me about my hobbies, what I do for fun, if I had kids... and at this stage I knew this wasn't just polite small talk to a customer.

I told him about my partner, and the hobbies we enjoy together, hoping that it would show me as unavailable and happy in my relationship.

But no, he still asked me out on a date, making it clear he was very attracted to me and had to try. To me, it's so disrespectful to ask someone out romantically when they have made it clear they are committed to someone else. I thanked him for his bravery in asking me out but restated that I am happily in a relationship and wouldn't want to even get a platonic coffee with a man I don't know. 

If I had shut down his questions before he asked me out, I think I could have been seen as rude. But it could have prevented things being even more awkward now after rejecting him. 

So, why do some guys still give it a go when they know the person is in a relationship? Why on earth would you want to start dating someone knowing they are with someone else? Then you would gain yourself a cheater which seems gross and tragic. Doesn't make any sense to me.

And of course the big question - is there any secret ways of communicating ""I am not interested"" before the question is even asked? 

I'm a nice person, smile a lot, very respectful. This often leads to these sorts of issues. I don't want to turn nasty and cold as the world doesn't need more of it. So please help me with any advice you can about navigating everyday interactions with men so I can do my best to not give them the wrong impression. 



TLDR; cashier asked me out after I already told him I was happily in a relationship.

**Now:**

Like some restless, untamed beast, Kaeden prowled the camp, her strides devouring the ground beneath her. She traced big, looping arcs around the canoe lake. Her pacing was like an orbit—well, if it weren’t for the probability cloud model messing that up. Not that she had a problem with the model. “Turning and turning in the widening gyre. The falcon cannot hear the falconer.” 

About thirty minutes ago, she had said her farewells to Aubrey by the cabin green, floating on the high of a perfect evening. They had a picnic by the lake, basking in the fading glow of the setting sun. They had feasted on tomato basil soup and grilled cheese sandwiches, Kaeden’s own handiwork! She could not express how delighted she was she didn’t ruin the food. Over light conversation, she had learned more about Aubrey: she was from Arizona, they shared a favorite movie in Tangled. Kaeden's heart even did a little flip just thinking about it all. Aubrey had laughed at some of her nerdy science jokes. A biologist walks into a bar, and the bartender asks “So, what's your order?” The biologist responds “primate.” 

There was no way she could just go back to the Hecate cabin and sleep after that. Even if it was hours beyond her bedtime. The giddy shake in her body made it impossible to lie there. So instead, she walked. And walked. And kept walking, the night air cool against her flushed cheeks. “Be the carbon to my hydrogen, then it’ll be me and you, not them. Our displayed formula would be shaped as a heart,” she sang softly, recalling some half-remembered ukulele love song from a YouTuber organic chemist.

But Kaeden’s brain couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Nerdy girls never get the popular girl, not really,  it whispered like a serpent. And besides, despite her difficulty in reading social cues, she could tell that Aubrey had been subdued. For the life of her, she wasn’t sure if it was Aubrey herself who was reacting strangely, or if she had done something wrong. By the textbook definition, it was a good date. Though this was her first attempt, she was only relying on testimony from others. Her frame of reference was rubbish until she got more data. Perhaps Aubrey was just being polite? Kaeden genuinely had fun. But she had problems with getting too exuberant about certain stuff, the whole volleyball situation with Chelsea had proven that. “The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of *passionate* intensity.” She mumbled. 

Looking back, the way she asked Aubrey out could be described as intense. No, “hey do you want to chill together sometime,” or “you’re pretty cool, I wanna hang out”, only just a whole dive into “do you wanna go on a date with me?” She had seen how Aubrey had looked when Kaeden asked. Like a deer in the headlights. She knew why she did it, it wasn’t some grand mystery. She just wanted things to turn out well for her camp life. It was a whole new beginning for her. Away from the people who once knew her. René had told her,  “try and get along with your half-siblings, practice, and try to make friends.” and by gods, if she was going to listen, she’ll go all in: double or nothing. 

“Surely some revelation is at hand.” 

Kaeden shook herself to clear her spiralling thoughts. And wait where exactly was she? She had managed to walk into the forest, and now all the trees looked the same. It was the same forest that René had warned had Myrmekes. Which were clearly ridiculous. The square-cube law would make any bugs that big splatter from the weight of their own body. But still, even if they were real or not, Kaeden did not have any wish to attempt any encounters with the bizarre kind.

“Gaaah.” Kaeden huffed. She was really excelling as a demigod tonight. All the trees looked the same, which is to say, the normal tree assemblage of the Northeast United States. Mainly, all she could see were oaks, maples, birch and a few conifers. Standard temperate forest. And probably during the day, it would have been pretty nice. 

Hopefully someone  would realize she was gone. Come on, she was only fooling herself. She had made a minimal impact at camp so far.  The Hecate cabin could have been a ghost town for all she knew its occupants. She wasn’t even sure if Aubrey actually liked the date they had. Maybe? Oh by Connell’s barnacles, did Aubrey actually hate her? Would Aubrey have started spreading a rumor about her? No wait, Aubrey was bubbly and too nice for that. It would probably be exhaustion of Kaeden rather than hate. Polite people didn’t want to cause a scene. Aubrey just didn’t know how to say it. Certainly a lot kinder than Chelsea. Aubrey would be merciful to let her down slowly. 

“This is why people get exhausted by you. You have to go and make a big deal about the tiniest ant hills” the daughter of Hecate chastised herself. Great now her thoughts were thinking of the monsters that roamed the forest. Myrmekes. The second to last thing she was trying to think about. 

She could tell her autonomic nervous system was activating. Pupils dilating, hairs standing on end,  heart thumping thumping thumping. She didn’t even know what Myrmekes looked like. However the biomechanics worked, they just did. B.S. magic just threw every law out the window. Myrmekes were the ancient Greek word for ant, so at least a macroinvertebrate body. Bigger than a rodent? A dog? A deer? She imagined a horrible creature with a gaze blank and pitiless as the sun. If a camper had felt fit to warn her, then it was sure to be some size. And what about its mandibles? They likely were pretty strong if scaled up. And this was just what she was told about? If Myrmekes exist, and they break the square-cube law, then what else is out there? A dark shape with a lion body and the head of a man? Her foot brushed against something, and nearly yelped. Only a twig, thankfully. She would die out here from a heart attack if nobody ate her first. Her heart was hammering thrwump-thrwump. It sounded way too fast to her inexperienced ears. 

“Aubrey’s probably relieved to see us missing. She wouldn’t have to struggle with saying no to you. It’d be easier for everyone.” 

That movement? Was that actually something? Or just some trick of the light or an errant breeze? Maybe it was actually Aubrey finishing the deed? No, that was nonsense? Now it sounded like Aubrey was some Ted Bundy figure. Aubrey was many remarkable things, but she could never be a crazy axe whirling serial killer. She was too kind and lovable for that. 10/10 girlfriend material. 

“Shut up, brain!” She growled. That thought had managed to knock her out of her thoughts, at least. 

She needed to get a hold of herself, before she tried to get out of here. Her thoughts were not helping at all. 

She spied *Quercus alba* white oak, with its trunk gnarled and thick. She sat down, leaning against it. She needed to calm her racecar thoughts. She closed her eyes, took deep calming breaths, and touched her dry lips. She should be activating her peripheral nervous system with her actions. And it was such a shame that the date turned mild at best; she still thought the girl was so beautiful. Aubrey literally was a playful midsummer night’s breeze. A breath of  fresh air.. What did that even say about her? 

And why did this **always** happen to her? 


**Before:**

Joyce Mack High School was a dream. The school was named in honor of the legendary University of Las Vegas philanthropist who passed away peacefully in the fall of 2024. Conceived in 2026 to meet Las Vegas’ growing population needs, it would remain under construction for four years.

It had been filled with the latest reliable technology, staffed by competent individuals, and designed with a variety of socially inclusive initiatives, including peer mentoring, free lunch programs, after-school clubs, and expanded academic support. As with all schools built in the rising half of the 21st century, it was championed as a beacon of hope, inclusivity, and progress.

Yet, despite the progressive refrains espoused by the mayor, the city council, and the Clark County School District, there were cracks.

What the teachers didn’t know wouldn’t hurt them.

In 7th grade, part of Joyce Mack High School’s dream was tangible. Kaeden had no complaints about her classes; in fact, she loved every aspect of them. It’s just the other students she still has problems with.

Wham! The sound of Chelsea’s hand slapping her cafeteria tray made her jump nearly two feet high. The tray along with her slice of perfectly cooked pizza clattered to the floor. Kaeden’s breath hitched. The noise had broken Kaeden out of her whirring thoughts; predictions on the PowerPoint for the science lecture today. She loved the recent unit topic on food webs. She had done some extra reading on the topic, and who knew that only a small amount of energy made it through each step in the web. It tickled Kaeden’s brain just right. 

“I was looking forward to that.” Kaeden pouted. She desperately looked around for the lunch monitors or any teachers, but the room was beyond packed. Why was it that people always struck while any hint of authority was away? It was an insidious skill of any bully.

“You actually like the pizza here, Hartley? It's just heated grocery store pizza.”

“It doesn't matter where it came from. It's still good.” 

“Hah. That just shows you have no taste.” 

“What is it that you want, Chelsea?” 

“I came to ask why you didn't participate in the All-School volleyball tournament yesterday. You totally missed me scoring the winning points. My team totally trounced on those other losers. I would have loved to see you there.”

“Is that why you felt the need to demonstrate your spiking ability on my tray?” 

“Exactly. Now answer the question, Hartley.” 

“Cause I asked Mr. Case if I could stay with her and do some extra reading. Volleyball and crowds aren't really my thing.” 

Chelsea scoffed, “and miss the euphoria of the competition? Do you even need the extra credit?” 

“No, but it was fun. She let me peek at her old college textbook.” In fact, she was currently sitting at a 87, not the best but it was a good score in her book. “Can you just go? I just want to be left alone.” 

“Sure. But you better not miss next month’s All-School volleyball tourney.” 

“Or what?”

“You’ll see.” The Queen Bee grinned like a hungry shark, all teeth. There was blood in the water, and she smelled it. “Until then, well, enjoy your slops.” 

The girl shivered as the star athlete walked away, unsettled. She scooped up her pizza slice from the ground. Luckily, it was still salvageable. She didn’t want to cause further scenes. Remaining slouched, she trotted over to the nearest empty table. She let long, dirty-blonde hair droop before her eyes. If she pointedly ignored everyone, then everyone would return to their conversations. She wiped off the slice as best as she could, and took a hearty bite. It was still cheesy doughy goodness. 

Despite generally liking biology, she sat in the back row after lunch. She didn’t even raise her hand to answer a question Mr. Case asked. She was too preoccupied, thinking about the threat that Chelsea had promised. It stayed with her through the rest of her classes. She wasn’t exactly devastated or torn up about it, but it stuck with her like a thorn beneath her nail.

“I don’t know honey,” her dad answered after a long pause after Kaeden told him how her school day went. To summarize, pretty terrible. She was lying on the couch. She watched as he was attempting to practice his latest magic trick. It had involved a multitude of interlocking but Kaeden hadn’t felt like trying to dissect his performance. Truthfully, she had been in a sort of haze since lunch. A whirlwind of churned thoughts spun in her head.  

“I think you should participate. It could be fun! And you could maybe make a friend? It’s supposed to be a tournament style, right? There’s only a small chance that you’ll run up against Chelsea on the court.” 

“Not impossible though.” 

“It’s a managed event. If things get too hectic the teachers will step in.” His advice did seem reasonable. 

“Not like they did so today.” Kaeden mumbled. 

He glanced up from his rings, “what was that honey?” 

“I said thanks for the advice dad.” She answered, speaking up. 

He set down the rings on the coffee table, and sat down at the end of the couch, somewhat awkwardly on the arm. 

“Hey, I promise that it does get better than this. People in highschool can act like jerks, but one day they just won’t matter anymore. 



Kaeden nodded, her smile not quite reaching her eyes “Thanks dad.” 

“Now come on munchkin, don’t you have some homework to do?” 

“I guess.” 

When the sign up sheet for the All-School volleyball tournament was passed around in their homeroom Kaeden looked up to see Chelsea staring daggers at her.  Kaeden could read her mouthed words well enough. “You better not wimp out. I'm looking forward to this.” With shaky hands she added her name to the list to the bottom of the filled page. What choice did she have in the matter? Thankfully, the school handled teams, so she didn’t have to put herself out there asking people to gracefully consider letting her join. 

The two weeks leading up to the event were a horror movie, with a dissonant sliding violin. She knew the monster movie was out to get her, but it still hadn't revealed its appearance. Every day was just one step to the game, she rather it was just over with it. At least Chelsea had decided to give her some peace. Even with her social ineptitude, Kaeden could tell that the upcoming volleyball game was the only talk around school. Students were speculating on both teams, and who would win. Even teachers seem to be excited for the big day. Though, she wasn’t sure if it was an act or not. 

On the day of the tournament, Kaeden decided to take her father’s advice to heart. She could only control herself. She wanted to give it all to her potential team, and perhaps she would meet a friend in the process. It wouldn’t be all that bad, really. 

“I can do this,” she told herself resolutely while standing in front of the female locker room’s mirrors, “time to face the music. You’ll do fine.” She adjusted her sleeves before making her way out to the gym. 

The gymnasium was packed. So many students were mingling in groups, discussing whatever. And she easily spotted Chelsea, who looked in the element. She even had blue and red face painted stripes on her face. “Rah, Rah, Rah, that’s the spirits we have around here!” Kaeden quoted under her breath. Not like anyone would get her reference. Her dad’s tastes could be eccentric. 

Before she could figure out where to stand that wouldn’t be awkward, Coach Wright blew his whistle, “Alright students! Everyone line up on the wall. We’ll call your name and you’ll find your teammates. We’ll go over the rules, and then you guys can start playing.” Coach Wright was a dishevelled man, with a mop of unruly brown hair, and a cool goatee. It looked like the school had hired him straight out of a biker gang. Rumor had it that he packed a right hook, Kaeden wasn’t sure if she actually believed the stories, though. 

Kaeden lined up on the wall, just like a police lineup. This must be what criminals feel as they await judgement. Picked out by a witness, before the game even began. B-but she was innocent though, right? Chelsea had no right to complain. 

Reading from his papers Coach Wright began naming students, “Alright folks for the Reindeer Team we have Tasha Hendricks, Sam Brooks, Dick Nalchina, Nick Nalchina, Daisy Wilson, and Carmen Cruz.”  

“Bruh! Just go by Richard!” Someone called out, further down the line. Snickers followed. 

The called students were already finding each other and catching up. They had no need for introductions. 

“For the Antelope team Irena Phllips, Gwen Samsons, Drew Hendry, Dakota Thompson, Holly Morales, and Bryce Ellis.” 

More animals were called, and teams grouped up. Chelsea called to be part of the Scorpion Team. Some lowly school administrator must have gotten a chuckle for that choice. 

Was that a wink that Chelsea threw her way, or was she just imagining things? Either way, Kaeden did not like the vibes that the competitive girl had. 

“And last but not least we have Quincy Troy, Lindsey Johnstone, Lexi Marsh, Indigo Schnoz, Harris D’argent, ” 

Kaeden held her breath. She at least knew of some of her teammates. Lindsey was in her history class, and Harris always had a good joke. Kaeden let out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding. If anything, this was the best team she could hope for. Soon they could get to playing, and the school could get back to normality. Maybe they could actually do pretty well in this tournament. 

“And Kaeden Hartley for the Brown Bears!” 

“Yaaaay!” Kaeden whooped, almost as a rebel yell as she jogged to join her teammates. This was it. Their team was Sparta facing down the Persians -- 300 was an awesome movie.

Harris shot her a look she couldn't exactly decipher, “who snuck you the Red Bull?” 

Before she could explain just how excited she was, Coach Wright whistled.

“Okay, now that we have teams, let's go over the rules.”

Kaeden only mildly listened to Coach Wright. She was too busy trying to get in the zone, and imagining what it would be like to win. For the first time, she actually felt epic about today. But to be fair, it was basic stuff. The tournament was set up as single elimination, first to ten points won, don't cause injury, but most importantly have fun. If you've heard one school P.E. teacher list rules, you heard them all. With the amount of teams playing, the games were designed to be quick and decisive. 

An older Kaeden would laugh about how their first matchup seemed planned. Once again whichever school administrator planned this was having a good chuckle. The Polar Bears versus the brown bears! She would go on a long tangent explaining the concepts of hybridization and the somber pizzly bear. But for today, she was content to take the center back position and help her team score points. She did fine, she wasn't the best volleyball player, but she wasn't the worst. She even managed to save the ball from hitting the floor, not once but twice. 

And somehow they won their first game! But more importantly she had fun. Who knew volleyball could be so engaging? Coach Wright would want her on the team after today. She was sure of it.

As the games continued on, the Brown Bears clawed into their competition. Rally, set, point. And Kaeden kept feeling more and more in the zone. She managed to perform a dive onto the polished wooden floors, just like the pros did. And okay, it was a lot more jarring than she expected, but even a little soreness couldn't bring her down. Her teammates were even complimenting. She never received this much accolades normally in school, even if she didn't actually seek out validation from her peers. 
She had traded out her shrieking violin horror movie for the triumphant teen sports film. Like every good climax, it was no surprise that the Brown Bears and the Scorpions would clash in the final match. Chelsea’s team had been just as dominant. It was fated. Beginner’s luck against pure athletic skill.
It was close. No team could pull ahead. Maybe everyone was exhausted after so many games. They had started at 2 p.m., and now it was pushing closer to 6.
""Alright!"" Coach Wright called out, handing the ball to Kaeden. ""The score is tied, nine to nine. One final point will decide it. The Brown Bears or Scorpions!""
Kaeden breathed in deep. She could already see it. Her teammates lifted her on their shoulders. The roar of the gym, the vindication. They’d carry her, just like in the final scene of every great sports movie.
""Let’s go, Kaeden!"" they'd chant. She’d finally prove herself. Finally show up Chelsea at her own game.
She tossed the ball up and pummeled it. 
The ball flew towards Chelsea’s face. Straight and true rocketing like an arrow. The impact  was visceral. It was a mix between a Minecraft oof sound and a crack of thunder. Kaeden tried not to grin. She really did. But it was perfect. Chelsea’s stunned expression, the way she staggered. It was laser guided karma.  Then Chelsea pulled her hand away. The blood stood out like it was under an UV light.
Her stomach dropped.
Uh. Oh. 
Coach Wright’s whistle cut through the uneasy silence.  
""Foul! Match goes to the Scorpions!"" His voice was sharp, freezing. 
The mood crashed: an explosive train wreck. 
The gym, once buzzing with excitement, felt off-kilter. A tension settled in, thick and uncomfortable, like a heavy blanket. 
Kaeden grimaced. She had gone from underdog hero to bully in less than sixty seconds.
It felt like she had been someone else on the court. The rush, the thrill, it had carried her too far. Maybe sports weren’t worth the high stakes if this was how she acted with them. 
Her teammates weren’t celebrating. They were staring.
Lindsey broke the silence. *""What's with you today? You're normally not this animated in class. It’s like I don’t even know you.”*
“I d-don’t know, I just wanted the games to go well.” Kaeden squeaked.

Out of the corner of her eyes, she could see Chelsea starting to be escorted to the school nurse’s office. That was definitely a glare sent her way. Whatever Chelsea reason had for getting involved in the All-School volleyball tournament, Kaeden doubted that the reason was this. But oddly enough, Chelsea also looked slightly intimidated. “Jesus Christ Hartley.” 

“It was just a game Kaeden, you didn't need to get this wound up about it. Sometimes you're just too much, you know that?” Lindsey eboused. 

Kaeden deflated. “I know.” 

From horror film to teen sports to whatever this was. Kaeden couldn't even guess what it was now. 


**Now:**
She wasn’t thinking about Chelsea anymore. Not really. But the weight of that moment clung to her. No matter the circumstance, she was back in the gym. Even now, with the night pressing in on her. Kaeden opened her eyes again. She had calmed down slightly. Her breath had steadied. Her mind has stopped spiraling. And she really needed to get back like yesteryear. 
The forest was still and quiet, like the whole world had decided to share in her exhaustion.
She really needed to head back before something decided to make her a snack.
With a sigh, she glanced down at herself, already calculating how much shower time she’d need to look remotely presentable. A long shower. A good night’s rest. Maybe try to talk to Aubrey and apologize for her actions. Maybe they could just be friends? Or maybe even roommates? But even that felt like too much, as if her puppy of a brain was already foreseeing a whole relationship out of just one date. 
She went to brush the dirt off of her, looking down at her body. Then she froze.
Something was wrong. Or… different? Her mind warred between comprehension and curiosity, struggling to make sense of what she was seeing.
She didn’t need to be a demigod expert to know she had activated something. Her body looked faded, ghostly, insubstantial. A trick of the light? No. She could feel it. It was unnatural. 
She had become part of the shadows. It felt like a cold chill running through her nerves. 
She and the darkness had blurred together, the lines between her and the night indistinct. It wasn’t just camouflage. She was hidden, completely supernaturally so.  
Maybe it was her brain continuing to play tricks on her. She had a long day after all.  To check, she pinched herself. She blinked and rubbed her eyes. Maybe it was just exhaustion? No. No, something was wrong. No, no, it seemed weird, but even the pinch felt numb, like she wasn’t all the way there. 
Her breath quickened. Some part of her mind could recognize that she was hyperventilating, but that part felt just as distant as the rest of her body. The forest had grown too quiet, the trees too thick, and camp felt like a dream away. Kaeden felt like she was in a liminal space, between life and death, perhaps?

I got a cart from my friend then the same day when I went to work, I went to the bathroom to test it out. Hit it once while sitting down after going to the bathroom didn’t really get a good inhale so I went in front of the mirror while I was washing my hands did a ghost inhale then as I sucked the smoke back in I hear somebody walk in the bathroom now I’m like oh shit I just took like damn near a blinker and somebody just walked in the bathroom somebody’s about to smell or see what I just did and I really like my job and I didn’t wanna get fired so I zero hit it. I started coughing. It would’ve been less obvious if I had just blew a fuck ton of smoke all over the place without coughing so I run out of the bathroom dying coughing sit back down at my desk to do some work. I start overthinking. I’m like oh shit was that my boss who just walked in etc., etc. then I noticed as I’m doing my work. (Social media so it’s all computer shit) I started getting what I thought was tunnel vision everything feels like I’m in a dream. I look around at the printer at the desk next to me at a janitor who is on her break. Nothing felt real. I noticed I get super shaky when I tried to text my mom. My fingers just weren’t doing the right thing. My heart is pounding through its chest so I tell myself for some dumbass reason lol you should make some coffee to snap out of this. You’re high and you’re overthinking go make some coffee. I try to make coffee. There’s another person in there sees me spill my coffee grounds all over the cake cup, and all over the table, he asked me when I leave the break room. You need a break from making coffee as a joke. I walked out of the break room into the hallway and said I have to get out of here. People asked me if I’m OK I can’t respond because I feel like I’m about to die or have a heart attack. I get in my car for some reason and I asked God like it to my dying. I feel like I was about to die. I started asking myself like was I lay like what’s going on? I finally settled down after probably 30 minutes and going to urgent care getting an EKG or whatever it’s called. Everything came back clear blood test Covid swab everything so I’ve pretty much boiled it down to a panic attack because I was overthinking. I thought my boss caught me smoking weed at the job I was terrified to smoke again until a couple nights ago. I was watching an Eric khan video. And decided to make a water bottle bong because like of course that would make the weed go down better and that night went fine. I got a good high and went to sleep. Thought nothing of it then Tuesday night I was smacking the fuck out of that water bottle, bong, and cart. I laid down to watch house of cards in my bed Took one final rip put it down and decided I was done for the night. Let me not overdo it, but did I know I would indeed overdo it I start getting tunnel vision I try to calm myself down. OK you got through this you can get through it again. It’s a panic attack. You’re OK, but this one lasted a lot longer and was a lot worse I had the realization The pounding heartbeat everything that comes with it but for probably an hour and a half I went to go to the guest bedroom to lay down after all this time past probably about 1220 1230 maybe 12 o’clock I’m not sure if you’ve ever had a panic attack you know your sense of the time is kind of bad. The derealization went away. My heart was still pounding, but I finally got myself to fall asleep. I wake up the next day. My whole body is weak. My heart is still feeding pretty fast not as hard, but definitely still fast. My blood pressure was 135 but my pulse was low And I still kinda have that fog of the realization but not as bad as it was when I first had a panic attack like we’re really nothing feels real. It was just kinda like I felt like a robot almost that day goes by. Fell asleep. Woke up the next day. My heart still pretty jumpy. My blood pressure is at 1:29 Ish 125 maybe now that the day ending I had a pretty annoying headache that wouldn’t go away until just now and I’m still very weak so to sum it all up. I feel like I’ve gotten better with time but just wanting and looking to get some closure that I may be in the end stages because I really enjoy playing basketball and working out, but I don’t feel like I can do that with the way my blood pressure feels and how it makes me feel anxious and nervous. I’ve never had a history of anxiety or panic attacks. This last week has been my first two ever in my life besides when I was maybe a seven or eight-year-old and I used to get really really bad night terrors but I gave that up over age. I’ve never really had a run with this type of stuff before so it made me extremely nervous hence why I went to urgent care at first time I guess there’s nothing I can really do besides trying to keep going and just push through it but man it’s hard when I lay down and feel my heart beating every night just looking for some closure or some advice. Anything while I know this is a super long paragraph. I truly apologize even if no one reacts to this it kind of feels good to just get everything off my chest I’ve been reading a lot of your guys stories and reading the comments of the stories and it has helped me get through The worst part of it after thinking I had a heart arrhythmia and all this other stuff lol so I haven’t ever commented on this community but I already appreciate the support just from reading your guys’s interactions with panic attacks. I hope everyone have a great night if you have any questions or any advice, feel free to let me Know. I love you all. Have a great night.😀",1,1739496088.0,PanicAttack,0,1.0,False

**Title: Pete the Puggle’s Plucky Adventure at Manhattan Beach**

---

### Chapter 1: The Jitters Begin

The morning sun filtered through the windows of the cozy little house in Burbank, casting a warm glow over Pete's fluffy white fur. His heart raced as he sniffed the air, detecting the scent of Mom's fresh coffee and Dad's signature cologne. Mariya was at the kitchen counter, meticulously packing snacks while Pete's older brother Roman, ever the prankster, sneaked up behind him, causing Pete to yelp.

""Come on, Pete, it's just a trip to the beach,"" Lenny encouraged, ruffling Pete's ears. ""You'll have so much fun once you're there."" Mariya added, her eyes twinkling with mischief, ""Think of it as an adventure, not a chore.""

Pete wagged his tail uncertainly, his mind clouded with thoughts of the vast, open water. He'd heard tales from other dogs about waves that crashed and currents that pulled, but Roman's teasing made him want to prove himself.

---

### Chapter 2: The Journey Begins

The family packed up the car, with Pete squirming in his seat, his nose pressed against the window. As they drove towards Manhattan Beach, the sky widened, and Pete's anxiety grew. He watched as other dogs wagged their tails from car windows, their joy contagious yet intimidating.

""At least you're not the only one,"" Roman whispered, leaning close to Pete's ear. ""Imagine how fun it'll be once you're jumping in the waves."" Mariya reached back to pat Pete's head, her touch a balm to his jittering soul.

---

### Chapter 3: The Dog Park Excitement

Upon arrival, the family set up their beach blanket near the water's edge. Pete hesitated, hiding behind a nearby bush. He watched as families played, dogs bounding into the waves with joy. A golden retriever named Max waded effortlessly, his tail wagging in pure delight.

Baron Munchausen appeared suddenly, his coat gleaming and eyes twinkling with mischief. ""Pete, my boy,"" he said, crouching down, ""you're missing out on the best part—splish-splashin' in the ocean!"" Tom, a sleek black cat, sauntered over, purring softly, while Jerry, the brave mouse, scurried along the sand.

---

### Chapter 4: The Enigma of Baron

As Pete's hesitation grew, Baron began weaving tales of his adventures, each more fantastical than the last. ""In my day,"" he declared, ""I've faced stormy seas and emerged victorious!"" Tom nodded gravely, while Jerry, ever curious, sat on hind legs, ears perked.

""See here,"" Baron continued, placing a paw on Pete's shoulder, ""the water isn't something to fear—it's something to conquer."" His words resonated deep within Pete, sparking a courage he didn't know he had.

---

### Chapter 5: The Scare and Rescue

Max, eager for play, charged towards the shore. His energy was infectious, but Pete froze, panic rising in his throat. With a splash, Max dove into the waves, sending ripples outward. Startled, Pete darted forward, plunging into the water before he could think.

The cool wave rushed over him, displacing his fear. He paddled back to shore, trembling yet triumphant. His family waited, eyes filled with pride and relief.

---

### Chapter 6: Facing Fears Together

After the scare, Pete found himself opening up to his family. ""I was scared,"" he admitted, his tail tucked but head held high. Mariya shared her own fears, how she once faced a stormy sky that later revealed a rainbow.

Roman, ever the encouragement, said, ""You did great, Pete. Now, let's show Max who's boss!"" Together, they returned to the water, their collective courage swelling.

---

### Chapter 7: The Leap of Faith

With the sun high and hearts united, the group gathered at the edge. Baron gave a final nod of encouragement, and Pete took a deep breath, his paws itching to dive in. With one mighty leap, he surged into the waves, fear giving way to exhilaration.

The water enveloped him, cold yet invigorating. He emerged, shaking but grinning, as his family cheered. The once-daunting ocean was now a playground of joy.

---

### Chapter 8: Reflections and Growth

As they packed up to head home, Pete felt a quiet pride in himself. He'd faced his fear, not alone, but with the love and support of those around him. Lenny reflected on their journey, noting how each had grown—Pete from fear to courage, Mariya from doubt to encouragement.

Roman summed it up best: ""Sometimes, life throws you into the deep end, but that's where you learn to swim."" Pete nodded, his heart full, knowing this was just the beginning of many adventures.",1,1739496086.0,Petes_Stories13,0,1.0,False

Given the circumstances and environment we were in, it would have to be subtle.
But I've thought about it from every possible angle and there's no way it wasn't them giving a signal.
But what do I do with that?

I'm aware that given the circumstances that have led me down my path through life that a block I need to come to terms with is that I'm not mentally insane.
I get that. But the issue I have is that accepting that has brought on much more downloads and intuitive abilities for myself (that are not only for the TF journey), but knowing what lies ahead, knowing how he truly feels and having to stand back to wait for him to come to terms with it and do something about it. 
Seeing all his thoughts about what if I just said this or that, what if he approached me, and then feeling him back away from that because he thinks I'm gonna cut sick at him.. he thinks I'm gonna go off for some reason. Possibly one of our last one on one convos might have given that off.
He was gonna ask me for coffee today, and I think he was going to buy me some flowers, but he psyched himself out. 
I was in such a good mood from those downloads. It would have been the perfect day for it.


He won't speak to me outside work. 
I've tried to start conversations and he just doesn't respond or he just shuts it down., I was with someone and it caused a ruckus, but he couldn't even stand in the certainty of what he was saying, he dawdled around the subject.
I am now single.

There's only 2 ridiculously minor things stopping us from being together... 

SIMPLE CLEAR MESSAGE
If he can't fucking handle it maybe he shouldn't date the chick's he KNOWS likes his friends. 
He knew I liked you, and pursued me anyway. 
Him and I were together for like a month. 
It wasn't even that serious.
You shouldn't be that worried about his feelings given the circumstances. 
If he's that upset about it MAYBE that's a HIM PROBLEM, and not a YOU problem.

He doesn't even care about you and me anyway, he's only sad about it cause he pity parties himself for every bad thing that happens. 
He's a chronic depressive and he lives there because it's comfortable, not for any other reason. He seeks out situations that could hurt him for not only attention, but someone else to blame. He has so much potential, and he's not even blind to it, he just doesn't want to use it because he's comfortable being sad and lonely. He has no aspirations to be happy in his life ever, yeah he's had it hard, but perpetuating his own suffering for comfortability sake isn't the answer and he needs to wake the fuck up to himself and start being an adult and not a teenager. 

And anyone else who might get upset about it, big woop. Too bad so sad?

Also this job can go fuck itself.

And now my day is ruined and I am livid.

I’ve had a stutter my entire life, a pretty bad one that caused me to be super introverted as a kid. Going into college I got out on Citalopram, which helped but the decreased libido was not worth staying on the medication. I stopped taking Citalopram after college and my stutter went back to how it was when I was a kid, I would rate it a 8/10 on how hard it was to talk. I went back into the shell that I put myself in as a kid, which isn’t as easy as it was when I was kid because now I have a full fledged career as a nurse where I have to speech to patients on a daily basis. This is when I decided to try Abilify. I was a little scared at first because it’s an “antipsychotic” and can cause akathesia and drowsiness. But I decided to say yolo and try it because I could not continue living how I was living.

It’s been about 5 months now being on Abilify and the only symptom I have is mild drowsiness but I just drink coffee to counteract that. My stutter now is about a 3/10 on hard it is to speak. I am able to interact with people at work and in my day to day life like a “normal person” with only a few slip ups every now and again. I feel confident to go back into the dating scene and feel like the world has opened back up now. Feel free to leave questions below and I’ll try to answer them asap.

1ioywad,https://www.reddit.com/r/barexam/comments/1ioywad/most_tested_civ_pro_topics_in_a_gen_z_way_with/,Most tested civ pro topics in a gen z way with examples,"Alright, let’s break down the most popular Civil Procedure topics on the Universal Bar Exam (UBE) in a way that’s easy to vibe with—Gen Z style—plus some fun, relatable examples to keep it from being a snooze-fest.

1. Personal Jurisdiction (PJ): Can This Court Even Touch You?

What It Is:
PJ is all about whether a court can drag you into their group chat (aka the lawsuit) based on your connection to that state.

Vibe Check:
	•	General Jurisdiction → You basically live in that state. They got your whole life on “Find My Friends.”
	•	Specific Jurisdiction → You don’t live there, but you pulled up for a hot sec and caused drama.

Example:
You’re an influencer based in LA. You visit New York for Fashion Week, accidentally spill matcha on another influencer’s $10k outfit. They sue you in NY.
→ NY has specific jurisdiction because you pulled up and caused chaos.
→ If you lived in NY full-time? General jurisdiction.

Key Phrase for Exam:
“Minimum contacts + fair play & substantial justice.”
Translation: You gotta have enough receipts tying you to the state, and it shouldn’t feel like a total setup.

2. Subject Matter Jurisdiction (SMJ): Is This Court Even Built for This?

What It Is:
The court is like, “Do we even handle this kind of drama?”

Two Big Energy Types:
	•	Federal Question: Did you break a federal rule? (e.g., copyright issues, Constitutional rights)
	•	Diversity: Is it giving “we’re from different states, and you owe me more than $75k”?

Example:
	•	You buy sneakers from a shady reseller in Texas; you’re in New York. You get scammed out of $80k.
→ You can sue in federal court because you’re in different states, and that cash is way over $75k.
	•	You sue over $20k? State court, bestie.

Key Phrase for Exam:
“Complete diversity + >$75k.”
Translation: Everyone’s from different states, and the beef is expensive.

3. Venue: Where’s the Tea Getting Spilled?

What It Is:
Even if PJ & SMJ are good, where exactly are we linking up to fight?

Good Venues:
	•	Where the bad stuff happened.
	•	Where the defendant lives.
	•	Sometimes where the property is.

Example:
You order a custom iced coffee machine from Seattle. It explodes in your LA kitchen. You can sue in:
	•	Seattle (where it was made)
	•	LA (where it exploded on you)

Key Phrase for Exam:
“Where defendant resides or where the claim arose.”

4. Service of Process: Did You Actually Slide into Their DMs?

What It Is:
You can’t sue someone if they don’t know they’re being sued. You gotta let them know, formally.

Ways to Serve:
	•	Personal service: Handing it to them like a subpoena on reality TV.
	•	Substituted service: Leaving it with their cousin who’s always home.
	•	Waiver: They agree to accept it via email because we’re all tired.

Example:
You sued your ex because they trashed your apartment. You hand them the papers at their fave brunch spot? That’s personal service.
Leave it with their roommate while they’re at Pilates? Substituted service.

Key Phrase for Exam:
“Reasonably calculated to give notice.”
Translation: Did you actually try to get their attention, or nah?

5. Erie Doctrine: Federal or State Vibes?

What It Is:
If you’re in federal court because of diversity jurisdiction, should the judge use federal rules or state law?

Rule of Thumb:
	•	Substantive? Use state law. (Stuff that could change the outcome.)
	•	Procedural? Use federal rules. (Stuff like deadlines.)

Example:
You’re suing for breach of contract. The state rule says you need 3 witnesses, but federal rules are chill with 1.
	•	Witness rules = substantive → Use state law.
	•	Deadline to file the suit = procedural → Use federal rules.

Key Phrase for Exam:
“Substantive → State; Procedural → Federal.”

6. Summary Judgment: “We Don’t Even Need a Trial” Energy

What It Is:
Before wasting everyone’s time with a trial, you can say, “Judge, it’s obvious I’m right.”

Standard:
No genuine dispute of material fact + I’m legally winning.

Example:
You have a TikTok of your neighbor admitting they keyed your Tesla.
→ Summary judgment motion: “Judge, we don’t need a trial; she confessed on live.”

Key Phrase for Exam:
“No genuine issue of material fact.”

7. Claim Preclusion (Res Judicata): No Second Chances

What It Is:
If you lost your case once, you can’t sue again for the same thing.

Conditions:
	•	Same parties.
	•	Same claim.
	•	Final judgment on the merits.

Example:
You sue your friend for not returning your AirPods. You lose.
→ You can’t sue again later saying, “Actually, it was about my AirPods Max.”

Key Phrase for Exam:
“Final judgment on the merits.”

8. Issue Preclusion (Collateral Estoppel): We Already Settled This Fact

What It Is:
If the court already decided a fact, you can’t reargue it in another case.

Example:
Court ruled that your roommate did steal your PS5.
→ They can’t argue “I didn’t” in a later case about stealing your Switch.

Key Phrase for Exam:
“Actually litigated & determined.”

Wrap-Up Cheat Sheet:
Personal Jurisdiction- Did you pull up here?	Minimum contacts, fairness
Subject Matter Jurisdiction-Is this the right court type?	Federal Question, Diversity
Venue-Where’s the tea party?	Where D resides, claim arose
Service of Process- Did they get the invite?	Reasonably calculated notice
Erie Doctrine	State law or federal rules?	Substantive = State, Procedural = Federal
Summary Judgment	We don’t need a trial.	No genuine issue of material fact
Claim Preclusion	No do-overs.	Final judgment, same claim
Issue Preclusion	We settled that fact already.	Actually litigated and determined ",7,1739495607.0,barexam,2,0.82,False

Both defendants have counterclaims. There are about 12 witnesses. I spoke to my managing attorney today about how the trial is gonna work. She dead ass said she thought she was just going to be there for ""emotional support.""

That really threw me off and I said no way. I have barely been practicing for 6 months. I have appeared in front of a judge twice. I have only ever sat in on one DUI trial in law school. She hasn't (read: basically won't) give me any advice on how to actually prep for a trial. I have no fucking idea how to prep for questioning, how to object properly, etc. I don't even know how to properly lay foundation.

She spends all day getting coffee with people, going out for drinks, lunch, etc etc. Basically, everything other than doing any legal work. She bills on average like 10-15 hours a month.

 I get it, some of you can handle that right away. But I have literally no experience relating to trials and I feel like I would be borderline committing malpractice by trying to do it alone.  

I am about to just quit tomorrow and never look back.

edit: To clarify because a lot of people are asking. Our retainer clearly states they are retaining the firm, and my managing attorneys name is on every filing alongside mine. 

Also, there is literally no one else in my firm who can help. We are a 6 person firm, and (besides my boss) the only other person who practices in my state was licensed the same time as me and does no litigation. The only person who can really help me is the boss.

1ioyo6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1ioyo6o/to_all_pimos_inactive_and_disfellowshipped/,"To all Pimo's, inactive and disfellowshipped Jehovah's witnesses!! Tips on how  you maybee can move forward in life and not get stuck.","How to move forward in life as an excluded or as an Inactive Jehovah's Witness? To shed light on this team to get an answer to this question, we will look at

- What does it mean for our mental health to be excluded or to choose to be inactive? 
- How does it affect our own subconscious?

Yes, this is a large and comprehensive topic, but a common denominator is that our whole life is turned upside down when we have woken up as a married couple at the same time or as singles.
Regardless of whether we have lost family members and grandchildren, it is a traumatic experience. You can experience having each other as support as spouses to manage to get through it. But what if you are alone and have lost all networks, then it can be extremely mentally traumatic can end with PSTD high stress can also trigger psychoses. You can also experience Psychosomatic disorders where things we experience mentally can make us physically ill too. Some have also unfortunately gone to that extreme and taken their own lives. So, this is an important and serious topic.

We can actually fool ourselves into thinking we have moved on but then we haven't. That was a strong statement you say: So how can we analyze ourselves to know where we are in this process? You could say that from the day you are excluded, or the day you choose to become inactive, to the time you have managed to move on in life within reason is a process phase.
So, let's now analyze this process and see where we are on the path of life as excluded or inactive.

The different phases are:

- The shock phase
- The processing phase
- The repair phase
- The reorientation phase

Let's look at the first phase, the shock phase

The typical thing is that the shock phase lasts for a few hours or days. This phase is characterized by inner chaos, anger, panic or apathy. Many describe it as standing on one's own side and being hit by a feeling of unreality

You can compare being disfellowshipped or leaving Jw to a grieving process where we have lost either family or friends, we can react with anger, sadness, guilt and work on yourself for why we didn't wake up sooner. Suddenly and sitting completely alone realizing that you have lived on lies for much of your life can be a big shock. Realizing that all the friends you had in the church were only friends based on conditions was also a shock. How long you are in this shock phase can vary from person to person. If you are completely alone without any network it can be very traumatizing.
You can experience the feeling of being worthless, creating guilt.

When you are able to accept the situation, and you are able to bear your own grief reactions, you will experience a release from the grief. This does not mean that it will never be painful to bear again, or that you are finished grieving. But by accepting the situation, you can make room for your feelings to be expressed. For example, it may be the need to laugh and find pleasant things. Or to cry and spend time with other people who have experienced the same as you.

How to get to the next phase, the processing phase?

In the processing phase, we are still left with anger, despair, anxiety and maybe still thinking about how everything could have been avoided. But we have a strong desire to want to process it all and move on. So, when we live in the processing phase, we have realized that we need to start repairing our feelings and thought patterns and the traumatic things that have happened. But in this phase, it is easy to get stuck in psychological factors such as
        Anger, despair, anxiety, guilt. So how can we then get to the repair phase?
‘
How to get into the Repair Phase?

When we understand that we need to repair our emotional wounds, and want to start doing
something about it and have accepted what has happened, then we are in the repair phase.
But if we are going to repair something, we need tools to repair ourselves.
Something that can help us understand why we need tools to repair ourselves, it can be to reflect on the following:

In what we see and hear, it has been found that over 100 thousand chemical reactions occur per second in our head. It affects our feelings, thoughts, and how we react in different situations. When we think about how we have been indoctrinated for hours and hours over many years, even 10,20,30,40,50,60 years.
Then it is quite obvious that we need tools to repair ourselves.

So what kind of tools do we have, how can we use them to repair ourselves?

- Social network of like-minded people:
Conversation therapy, getting out emotional blockages.
What controls us humans is our reactions through what we see and hear or have experienced. Either it gives us anger, frustration, sadness, depression, anxiety,
Or a feeling of happiness, joy, excitement, etc.

So the toolbox is ""happiness and satisfaction within reason"". What do we find in this toolbox? We will get into that now.

Then we automatically come to the last phase, the new orientation phase:
Which involves using the tools in practice, but first ...

We can say that there are 2 forms of happiness and satisfaction
- Intense happiness, well-being, emotions and momentary pleasures
- Deeper happiness, linked to meaning, living in line with one's own values
using one's own resources good qualities

Let's look at what tools one can use for and find ways ""happiness and satisfaction"" it could be these things:

1. Practice being present here and now in life.

- Be aware of what is happening here and now
- not what has been or will be
- Practice being aware of small moments of happiness.
Morning coffee, the sun warming you, a pleasant phone call

2. Learn something new, because it shifts the focus away from our own thoughts and things we
Can't do anything about.
- Take up an old dream
- Dance lessons, learn an instrument, find a hobby that doesn't necessarily cost you a lot of money

3. Be generous and give, shifts the focus away from ourselves

- Give gifts to spouses in between
- give of your time to help others in different ways
- Delight others with surprises

4. Cultivate good relationships

- Take care of good friends

- Network

5. Use your body, be active

- Gym, maybe train with someone if possible
- Be outdoors, go for walks
- Don't let it become a duty but a joy

6. Stable relationship, joy and satisfaction

7. Be at work, get your mind on something else

8. Gratitude

- Be grateful to others
say it in words, give praise
- Do good deeds
- Show gratitude to people
Maybe you've never thanked them.

9. Cultural experiences

- Concerts, museums, cinema, theatre

10. Positive thinking, impossible how to think positively everything is negative

- Train ourselves to think positively
spend 10 minutes a day writing down
3 things that went well that day

11 Money

12 Sleep

13 Cut out things that stress you out, thought patterns or actions.

Illustration Anchor: When the thought pattern stresses us out, it becomes like driving a boat with the anchor out all the time and while we drive, we get hung up on things that make things feel very heavy. Write down what stresses you the most because a lot of stress is (unconscious stress)

So now we have looked at this toolbox what can help us achieve happiness and satisfaction within reasonable limits. We probably already use several of these tools if we analyze ourselves.
Now you might say I will never be able to use all of these tools, it is impossible to get stressed just hearing about them. But just using 2-3 of these tools will help

So when have we looked at what can help us move forward in life as excluded or inactive. We have seen that it is like a grieving process through different phases We have become familiar with these 4 different phases:

- The shock phase,

- The processing phase,

- The repair phase,

- The reorientation phase

Having knowledge about these phases can help us analyze ourselves
where we are. Because we may have unconsciously been stuck in one of these phases for too long..

We have also seen what tools we have, with which we can repair ourselves The call in the end is….

Don't give up, challenge yourself, analyze yourself. Remember the difference between an optimist and a pessimist is like a donut. The optimist sees the whole donut
While the pessimist only sees the damn hole.
And as a Chinese proverb says:
""Don't be afraid to grow slowly, but be afraid to stand still""

I think we could debate a little about the toolbox:
""How to achieve happiness and satisfaction within reason""

Questions for reflection that can help us:
- How can one be present here and now, find small joys?
- How to be generous, give of our time, help others wake up?
- How can one Cultivate good relationships, networks, What to do?
- How can one use the body to be active, a sense of happiness.
- Why do it?
- How can one show gratitude, spouses
  appreciate praise How?

Good luck!!!

Hey everyone,

My wife (33F) and I (33M) have been living in Jodhpur, but finding like-minded friends here has been surprisingly tough. We both love to socialize, have interesting conversations, and meet new people, but meaningful connections feel rare—sometimes due to age gaps, sometimes due to ideology differences.

Most of our lives have been spent outside Jodhpur, so we don’t really have any old school or college friends here. We’re looking for people who might be in a similar situation—maybe you’ve moved here recently, or just struggle to find people to genuinely connect with.

If you’re someone who enjoys a good conversation over a glass of wine (or coffee), whether it’s about life, books, travel, relationships, or just figuring things out one day at a time, we’d love to meet you.

Well as an employee at one of these shops, I'm going to tell you my experience. 

Bob walks into the shop and ignores all the employees, him and his crew sit down and he sends over someone from his team to talk to us. They tell us why they are here and that we have to inform customers that the coffee is from Bob. Now you would think since they have requested for us to do extra work and promote his campaign that he would take the time to come down, talk, thank us or give a good tip. Neither of those things happened, on an order over $100 they gave a $5 tip. 

Now Bob if you are reading this, I know that you can't understand how the economy actually is. However, common courtesy for tipping is 15%-20%. Especially when the staff is going out of their way to provide an extra service for you. Not to mention the coffee sales worth of tips we missed out on during a rush. I have spent time around Politicians that care or at least ones that actually understand the game of politics, they always take the time to thank those who are working for them and show appreciation. Bob Bailey clearly does not see minimum wage workers as people worthy of his time. 

Before you all start telling to me get a ""real job"". I'll let you know that I am college educated and am in a well respected profession. I pick up shifts at the coffee shop to help pay my bills and save to continue my education at a university level. Which is why the loss in rush hour tips is a big deal to me and other minimum wage workers. We all are just trying to get by. 

As well, Bob Bailey has refused to attend all candidates meetings. If you cannot see how that is a red flag I will tell you. These meetings are where our politicians talk to the other parties/community and listen to their views/concerns. The fact that Bob is refusing to go to these events shows that he does not care to educate himself on current issues or possible different perspectives he may have not thought of. The man is arrogant and believes he doesn't need to do the work that the rest of our candidates are doing to get into office. Other candidates go to the meetings and still make public appearances. Bob only cares about himself and his other rich friends, that is who will benefit from him.

We are both single parents. Have been seeing each other for 1.5 years. Our kids know each other through sport but we haven’t told them yet. His eldest (14)is still struggling from their divorce.

I’m starting to feel annoyed at the fact he won’t tell his kids he’s dating someone (or even plant a seed that he is going on a date). I sound like a silly little girl, I know. But until his kids know, he refuses to tell anyone in his family about me incase the kids or his ex find out (they’re not on great terms). So I feel like a secret. He’s met a lot of my family, looked after my niece with me, had lunches with my mum. 

And all I want, eventually at SOME POINT in the future is to be able to visit him for a coffee if the kids are there for an hour or so. To stay over at his and not panic they might show up and catch us. Or take them to play mini golf or a football game etc. as a group. But he doesn’t feel ready to tell them. I don’t want to push him in to it. 

I’m also lying to other parents at the sports team who are good friends of mine because we don’t want the kids to find out from elsewhere. 

We were supposed to be going away this weekend too (which we have never done - we are lucky to see each other once a week!). I was so excited and he’s bailed because his son has an important event. Which I understand and accept but can’t help feel really disappointed. (I know, spoiled brat).

I’ve communicated all of this to him on multiple occasions. He listens and understands and says he’s scared his kids hate him or he hurts them. So I back off.
