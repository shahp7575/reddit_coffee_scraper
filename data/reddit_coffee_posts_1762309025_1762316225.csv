That was me last weekend — sitting on the couch, tearing cushions apart, blaming the dog, the usual routine.

I gave up and started tinkering. I’m a bit of a tech nerd, so I decided to see how Fire TV remote API actually works. After a few hours (and way too much coffee), I had find a simple phone-based remote working — voice, D-pad, app launcher, the whole deal.

Been using it ever since, and honestly, I kind of prefer it to the physical one. It connects instantly, no pairing drama, and you can even launch Netflix or YouTube right from your phone.

If anyone’s curious to try something similar, here’s what I’ve been using:

1oot6s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1oot6s1/unforseen_consequences_chapter_5/,Unforseen Consequences (Chapter 5),"\*\*“\*\*Did you want lemon or peach?” Ed called out from the small kitchen, peering out from above the off-white door of the fridge.

“Which one is almost out?” a voice, choppy yet sweetly high pitched, called out from the pit in the main room. Ed looked leaned down and looked back into the fridge, he grabbed both tin cartons and shook them, comparing the weight.

“Uhh, it looks like peach.” he called back out, holding the tin above his head.

“I’ll finish off that one then.” the voice called back out, trailing off with the clack of a beak. Ed closed the fridge and grabbed two blue plastic cups with long bendable straws from the cupboard and placed them on the counter Looking at the tin, the label showed a colorful image of a peach on a white background, on it read ""Transcendental Peach, For Human and Tilth tastes! 6% ABV.” Ed thought they could certainly work on their branding, but he and Mitla liked it anyway. He unscrewed the metal cap and poured the drink into each cup, shaking the tin to make sure it was completely empty, then threw it into the trash can located under the counter, and took both drinks into the main room. The room was square, about 400 square feet in size. A large wall-sized window gave an impressive view of the LA skylight from their 40th-story apartment. A datadisk music player, currently off, sat on a wooden table near the end, towards the bedroom. Next to it was a rounded screen embedded into the wall, via touch Ed could control everything from temperature (which he often kept colder on account of Mitla), lighting (which they often kept low), and even the volume of the doorbell. Off from the center of the room, near the front, was a conversation pit recessed into the floor, lined on three sides by soft cushioned couch seating facing a large television built into a set of shelves in the wall. Seated across from the TV was Mitla, Ed’s tilth girlfriend, watching “An Outside Perspective”; a show centered around showing Aliens human media (or vise versa) and hearing their reactions and thoughts. Like all tilth, her height was much shorter than most humans, a bit over four feet. Her scales were mostly dull rust brown, save for bright reds and yellows near the top of her head, contrasting with the brighter, heavier concentrated scales of male tilth. Ed stepped down from the floor of the main room into the recessed pit and placed his own drink down onto the coffee table positioned in the center of the pit. Mitla leaned over and rested her head on his shoulder, uncurling her legs, obscured by baggy lavender pants. Ed lifted his arm from beneath her blue and red mantle that had cascaded over him to hand her her drink, she took it graciously. Lacking lips, she placed the straw farther past her beak, punching the straw between her tongue and the roof of her mouth, she was able to form enough suction to sip from the cup. 

“So, what are they viewing tonight?” Ed asked, looking at the TV. Mitla took another sip before answering.

“An opera called *Pagliacci*, I think I’ve read about it before.” Ed nodded. She, like most tilth, had a high appreciation for music involving the human voice.

“Who do they have at the table?”

“Looks like they brought back both Sombe and Tlist, and they have a new guy who’s Lobar. I think they said his name was Bost?”

“They brought Sombe back? I figured they’d gotten rid of him after so many people had an issue with him calling *Ghostbusters* an affront to nature?”

“Well, you know how the Daarma are. If it’s not written in their scripture it’s an abomination. I guess somebody on the crew talked him down since last week.” The two sat and watched for a few minutes uninterrupted. Enjoying each other's company. It wasn’t until a commercial break that Mitla broke the silence.

“So, have you gotten any word about your next assignment? Things have been pretty quiet since you all got back from Barnard’s star.” Ed leaned his head back against the back of the couch.

“Nothing since the debriefing, I heard Captain Jason had been called in for more questions, though I can’t imagine that’s going to lead to anything new. All this shit is probably just the admirals trying to get their stories sorted after Harkin was KIA.” Mitla put her cup down and turned towards Ed.

“You haven’t spoken about him much, did you know him well?”

“Harkin? No, not really. I’d catch turning in his gun to Hazard every now and again, he was always breaking it in some stupid way. Boy, Hazard would have a field day with him.” Ed leaned forward and clasped his hands. “I mean, you know we’ve had people killed on missions before; either on the ship or on the ground. So it’s not like it’s unusual, but something about that mission just felt...off.”

“Off how?”

“I’m not sure, something about how it went down just hasn’t been sitting right with me... I’ll just have to wait and see what we hear next. I must admit, I’ve been kinda enjoying some extra time alone\~” he ended with a smile”

“Oh sure...” She said, slapping his arm playfully. He laughed in response. The two sat and watched TV for an hour or so before Ed went to bed, Mitla remained awake. Several hours into his sleep, as the sun just barely began to color the sky, Mitla shook him awake.

“Ed, Ed! Wake up."" He turned over, eyes still closed and half asleep.”

“Mmph, wha?”

“Ed, your computer is doing something weird. It’s playing an alarm or something.”

“Whaaat?” he asked, slurred.

“Just go shut it off then go back to bed. It’s annoying.”

“Mmm, fine.” he said, slowly rising from bed, looking out the window at the still mostly dark sky. He walked out from his single-bed room and zombie walked across the apartment towards his office. Inside the small poorly lit room was a computer-desk combo. A grating sound emanating from the computer was audible from the hallway, and now that he was in the room its volume was piercing, coupled with a flashing green motif he had never seen before. Upon sitting down and rubbing his eyes, he was slowly able to read the flashing message. Within the flashing box read “URGENT, READ IMMEDIATELY"". Pressing enter on the keyboard silenced the alarm and closed the box. Revealing a new text box that was seemingly frozen to the screen;

URGENT

ALL CREW OF THE ECS CADDO

MISSION CODE BETA

REPORT TO LUNAR ORBITAL DOCK

DETAILS ATTACHED

\-CAPTAIN JASON SHIROMA-

Below the text box was a command prompt, upon pressing enter again, a new set of text boxes appeared, detailing the captain’s questioning, court marshall, and supposed conspiracy. At the end, instructions on how to download this info onto an empty datadisk, and a line of code with instructions on how to brick the computer this message was sent to. Tired, but still complying, Ed jumped up and ran back towards his room.

“Ed, what-?”

“No time, start packing a bag for me, I’m going to need my bug-out bag.” Ed entered the bedroom, and began rifling through his drawers. 

“What, why?” I’ve been called back to the Caddo, something at HQ has gone wrong.” After a few moments of rifling, he found an empty datadisk and raised it back towards his office. 

“What do you mean it’s ‘gone wrong’?” Ed slotted the disk into the computer and plugged in the code. The data store on the computer was quickly written over to the datadisk.

“I don’t know yet. But it’s something bad enough to necessitate this...”

“Necessitate what-” before she could finish, the code completed and the screen turned black. A spark, and a small amount of smoke flew from the back of the computer. A few presses of the power button proved it was down for the count.

“Mitla, get the car ready. I need to get to the planetary station ASAP.” Ed grabbed his bug-out bag from her hands, shifted it a few times to check it’s contents, and ran to his room to put on his uniform.”

“Jesus, Ed...”

“Mitla, I know. But I need to go now, that’s all I know.”

“This doesn’t feel like a normal mission.”

“That’s because it’s not”

“Does that mean I can come?”

“Does that mean I can-? What? No. no you can’t come- what?” He stopped mid dress and looked up at her.

“You said this wasn’t a normal mission, which makes me feel that this isn’t sanctioned like normal. So I want to come.”

“Mitla, it’s still a mission, there are risks involved.”

“Then when will I see you next?”

“...I don’t know.”

“Then I want to go come with you.”

“Let’s Just get the car ready, Mitla, I don’t have time for this...” he stated. Dressed as much as he could be given the circumstances, he headed out the door, Mitla following close behind. He felt he would need quite a strong conviction to convince her to stay behind, but they would discuss that on the way to the star port.

1oot6l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1oot6l4/struggling_to_maintain_friendships/,Struggling to maintain friendships,"Apologies this is a bit long post. I’m literally shivering as I write this. I’m in a very vulnerable place after losing a parent, a relationship, and several friendships all at once last year. I still have three close friends I trust completely I know they’d never leave me but they’re busy with their own lives, which I understand. We talk once a week, sometimes only once a month, yet the bond still feels the same.

Still, I’m struggling to date again. Even something as simple as going out for coffee feels overwhelming. I’m at a stage where I can’t handle any form of criticism or rejection. Most of my days revolve around work and spending time alone in my room that has become my life now.

When I’ve tried to make new friends, it’s often felt one-sided like my efforts didn’t really matter. I give my all to the people I care about, but whenever I express my feelings, it somehow backfires and ends up ruining things. I try to stay respectful, yet people often say whatever they want to me without much thought, and somehow, I end up being labeled as “too much” or “too sensitive.”

There was a couple I became friends with recently. We used to cook and clean together, and I found myself contributing about 70% of the effort. Whenever they fought, they would go silent with me too. I understood they needed space, so I’d quietly take care of everything cooking, cleaning, whatever was needed. They would argue over who should do what, and sometimes they’d even get upset at me for relying on them. I reassured them that I’d make more effort and not make them feel pressured.

Eventually, we decided to divide responsibilities I was supposed to share cooking duties with my female friend, while her partner handled the washing. But soon after, he started washing only their own dishes and told me to wash mine separately. I was in shock because I thought we had agreed to share everything equally. When I brought it up, she called me “low” and “cheap” for even mentioning it and accused me of being selfish just because I said I felt they didn’t care about me. She said it would be hard to make amends if I didn’t stop bringing it up but after being labeled like that, I felt there was nothing left to fix. Now, we don’t talk anymore.

But what about me? Why doesn’t anyone ever fight for me the way I fight for them? I know people have their own lives, partners, and priorities they don’t need me the way I need them. Nobody seems to care as deeply or fight as hard for me as I do for them.

I’ve become so fragile that even meeting new people gives me intense anxiety. I make a strong first impression confident, warm, and full of kindness and I still try to be that person. But the moment I express my emotions or admit that I don’t feel supported, everything falls apart. I used to chase people to keep friendships alive, but now I just let them go and shut down instead. No matter what I do, I keep losing people. It never used to be this way.",1,1762315956.0,emotionalintelligence,0,1.0,False

In a world dominated by corporate coffee chains, independent cafes represent more than just a place to grab a quick drink. They are the heartbeat of local communities, offering unique experiences, passionate craftsmanship, and a genuine connection that mass-produced coffee shops simply cannot replicate. Every cup purchased from a local cafe is a vote of support for local entrepreneurs, neighborhood character, and sustainable local economies. The charm of independent cafes goes far beyond their artisanal coffee and homemade pastries - they are cultural landmarks that preserve the authentic spirit of community and creativity. www.chaiidosa.com

The Economic Impact of Supporting Local Cafes

Local cafes are economic powerhouses for neighborhood development. **Small businesses create significant local employment opportunities**, with independent cafes often hiring from the immediate community. According to the Small Business Administration, local businesses generate 44% of economic activity in their communities.

Key Economic Benefits:
- Directly support local job creation
- Keep money circulating within the local economy
- Encourage entrepreneurial spirit
- Reduce reliance on large corporate chains

These neighborhood coffee shops aren't just selling beverages; they're investing in community infrastructure and local talent. www.chaiidosa.com

Unique Culinary Experiences and Creativity

Independent cafes offer **unparalleled culinary creativity and personalized experiences**. Unlike standardized corporate menus, local cafes experiment with unique recipes, source local ingredients, and reflect the cultural diversity of their neighborhoods.

Distinctive Offerings:
1. Handcrafted specialty beverages
2. Locally sourced ingredients
3. Seasonal menu variations
4. Personal touch in preparation and service

Each independent cafe tells a story through its menu, decor, and atmosphere. www.chaiidosa.com

Sustainability and Ethical Practices

Many independent cafes prioritize sustainable and ethical practices more consistently than large chains. They often:
- Partner with local farmers
- Use environmentally friendly packaging
- Support fair trade coffee producers
- Minimize carbon footprint through local sourcing

**Environmental consciousness is a hallmark of independent cafe operations**, demonstrating a commitment beyond profit margins.

Community Connection and Social Spaces

Independent cafes serve as critical community gathering spaces. They host local events, provide workspace for remote workers, and create environments that foster human connection. These establishments are more than commercial spaces - they're **living rooms of the community**.

Social Benefits:
- Hosting community events
- Providing meeting spaces
- Supporting local artists and musicians
- Creating neighborhood networks www.chaiidosa.com

Personal Stories and Passion

Behind every independent cafe is an entrepreneur's dream and dedication. These business owners invest personal passion, cultural heritage, and creative vision into their establishments. Their stories inspire and enrich local narratives.

Supporting Cultural Diversity

Independent cafes often reflect the multicultural fabric of neighborhoods, introducing diverse culinary traditions and creating inclusive spaces that celebrate different cultural experiences. www.chaiidosa.com

Challenges Faced by Independent Cafes

Despite their importance, local cafes face significant challenges:
- High operational costs
- Competition from large chains
- Razor-thin profit margins
- Increasing commercial rent prices

Consumer support becomes crucial for their survival and continued contribution to community vibrancy.

How Consumers Can Make a Difference

Supporting local cafes involves conscious consumer choices:
- Choose independent over corporate chains
- Spread positive word-of-mouth
- Engage on social media
- Attend local cafe events
- Purchase gift cards

Every small action contributes to sustaining these vital community spaces. www.chaiidosa.com

The Future of Independent Cafes

As consumers become more conscious about supporting local businesses, independent cafes are positioned to thrive. Their ability to adapt, innovate, and connect authentically with communities ensures their continued relevance.

Conclusion

Supporting local independent cafes transcends mere coffee consumption. It represents a commitment to community vitality, economic resilience, cultural diversity, and human connection. By choosing to support these remarkable establishments, we invest in the heart and soul of our neighborhoods, creating vibrant, sustainable local ecosystems that benefit everyone through shared experiences and collective support.",1,1762315429.0,DosaAndChaiLovers,0,1.0,False

Hey Reddit fam,

Just joined today. I’m originally from Dehradun and have been working in Gurgaon for a while now. I work in the AI / deep tech space — one of those jobs that sounds exciting but keeps you glued to a screen most of the time.

I’m 30 now, from a Tier-1 college, doing well career-wise, but being away from home and living alone here sometimes feels… empty. Between work and deadlines, I barely get time to meet people, and honestly, haven’t built a circle here. No close friends, no relationship — just work and gym on repeat.

Sometimes I catch myself wondering — is this what success is supposed to feel like?

Would be great to connect with some like-minded folks around Delhi or Gurgaon — maybe for coffee, walks, or just conversations beyond work.

1oosxxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oosxxw/google_protocols/,Google protocols,"I does anyone have an opinion about Google and a Google business profile and what Google likes or doesn’t like? I’ve been focusing on my business, my online presence and worked to create a good Google business profile. 

Here’s the background:

I am a franchisee for a coffee company and the franchisors website is pretty lacking and not really focused on my service area, territory, etc. plus it’s very cold. It’s just a Google form asking for your name and email, etc.

I know I’m never gonna get business from that website so I decided to create a leads website where offices who wanted to get an office coffee service could contact me. And this page also had a lot more information about what we do, but I couldn’t use the same business name on the new website so I created a separate website.

Recently I was warned that if I was to add this second website, a leads, request information site, to my Google business profile it would risk Google‘s wrath and get me blocked/restricted for up to a year.

When I asked ChatGPT, it told me “YES” I can do that. But when I gave it some more information, like the fact that I don’t use the business name on the second website it seemed to reverse itself and said “NO”, I shouldn’t do that. So now I’m concerned. I just wanna do it correctly.

In reality, the second Website, it should be helping the First because it fills in the missing gaps from the franchisor website. I’m not trying to trick anybody, but I just don’t have access to the manual website to make any changes or fill in the missing data. Google could read this as spam or misleading if not done correctly.

Does anyone have an opinion in reference to Google business profiles, and Google‘s protocols and behaviors think that adding a second website in my profile is a negative that will cause me to be excommunicated or we don’t like the fact that it’s giving them the information that they really do want?",1,1762315239.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I have an espresso machine and I make lattes of 300 and 400 milliliters. I use DEX baskets with a volume of 15 and 20 grams, respectively, so that the taste is the same saturation (about 5 grams of coffee for every 100 milliliters of the drink). I know that a 1:2 brew ratio is considered a good rule, made in 30 seconds, but the problem is that I can't set up the coffee machine to make both 15 and 20 grams of coffee, getting 30 and 40 grams of essence, in 30 seconds in both cases. If I set up the grinding so that 15 grams of coffee and 30 grams of essence come out in 30 seconds, then 20 grams of coffee will give 40 grams of essence in a minute and a half (too long). If I set up the grinding, that 20 grams of coffee will give 40 grams of essence in 30 seconds, then 15 grams of coffee will give 30 grams of essence in 10 seconds (too fast). I chose something in the middle and get 15 grams of coffee and 30 grams of essence in 25 seconds and 20 grams of coffee and 40 grams of essence in 45 seconds. I don't know if this is correct, but the coffee tastes good. I'll be glad for any advice, most likely I'm doing something wrong. Thank you.",1,1762315139.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Just got a free bag of exhale coffee beans using their free trial. Wasnt expecting much, but feeling a noticeable buzz after two cups so far, about six hours apart - similar but more potent, to not having coffee for a few days. Both cups are giving me a buzz. Want to empathize that it's a very strong effect, which has really surprised me.

To provide more context, I generally have about 4-5 coffees a day, predominantly by grinding beans using a sage grinder and moka pot. 99% of the time I just buy from the supermarket, lidl mostly. Probably tried about 15+ different brands over the years. In no way a coffee expert. I'm using the same methods to brew the exhale beans. 

I love coffee, I do find it increases anxiety though, especially before big presentations. Whilst untested by giving a presentation, I do feel less jittery and anxious even with the buzz I'm feeling from exhale beans.

Off topic sort of, but thought I'd mention that the beans are causing the clutch to slip on the sage grinder; never happened before in two years. Will need to troubleshoot that tomorrow. Think it's because the beans are tougher because they've been lightly roasted.

I'm thinking of signing up to their subscription now, depending on what people say in the comments here and my work focus tomorrow whilst under the influence. It's quite an expense, but I'm thinking it's the real deal and their marketing may actually be genuine.

[sub $1500],"Hello all, I’m looking to get my hands on a Lucca Tempo from Clive Coffee, and seeing how we’re just a few weeks shy of Black Friday, I was wondering if they might have some kind of discounted sales on their products, like a percentage off or something, during BF?

I saw somewhere on Reddit that last year they did a “buy this amount, get an included gift” kind of sale. While that’s still a good deal, I already have all the things I need, just that I want to upgrade my espresso machine to something better, so a percentage off would be better for me.

And yes, I’m aware the Lucca Tempo is a rebrand of the Quick Mill Pop Up. While I can technically purchase the Pop up and save some cash, the Lucca Tempo comes with modifications that I quite like, and more importantly, it has a 3 year warranty (with Clive, but still better than just a single year).

If they might have some kind of a discount for BF, I’ll wait for the sales. But if they don’t typically do so, then I might just pull the trigger sooner than later.

1oostl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oostl8/cmv_real_life_is_inherently_mundane_and/,CMV: Real life is inherently mundane and disappointing at best and downright terrifying and nightmarish at worst.,"Last year or two has been pretty rough on me. Chronic illness diagnosis, parents falling to illnesses, chronic loneliness (since 8), and quarter-life crisis hitting me like a truck...... You name it.

I grew up with very controlling, overprotective, sheltering, and strict parents. No friends, no dates, bullied at school, binge-eating disorder, never rebelled, never formed an identity, and pretty much missed out on every formative experience and milestone a human is supposed to have during their teenage years.

Growing up, I pretty much lived in the future to cope with the suck. ""One day in the future, I will finally be able to escape the repressive rut and live an adventurous and exciting life to the fullest"", I used to tell myself. ""I will have a cool crowd of friends, a cute (she doesn't even have to be hot) girlfriend, and a cool life filled with adventures. I will make up for the lost time the universe robbed from me during my teenage and young adult years"".

But that never happened. While I did get my career nailed down and got to embark on a lucrative IT career (thanks to my parents and education), life became work-eat-sleep-repeat. Zero friends. Zero extracurricular activities. Zero interaction with women (except for polite exchanges with the cashier or professional discussions with several woman coworkers I work with who are all at least 15 years older than me).

Do you know they have a saying in Mandarin? 兩點一線. Translated literally as ""two dots one line"", it describes a life where one travels between only home and work (two dots) without going to other places (hence the one line, aka the one path only between home and work). This saying describes my life perfectly.

I have always longed for adventure since childhood, and I've always loved to watch other people's lives on social media and YouTube. Personally, my favorite has been Shiey and Logan Paul. But the more I lived, the more I realized that in the end, there is no adventure in our perfectly mundane and disappointing existence.

There is no Hogwarts ticket coming your way. There is no Gandalf, let alone some Isekai bullshit. Even the so-called adventurous and fun lives I see people post on social media are mostly that, posts carefully curated to sell you a dream and unrealistic expectations of a better and more exciting existence. The travels, parties, relationships, adventures, fun escapades, and such? All is not real and made up. Instead, just like me, they live perfectly mundane and disappointing lives and grapple with terrifying and nightmarish curveballs life throws in every person's way sooner or later (illnesses and such).

I've finally learnt to appreciate the small things: a bottle of Zero Coke, a warm bento after work, a cool or funny post from social media after a lonely day of work. Although I know that social media is not real, I still relish in the dream that it is real. After all, social media sells you a dream of a better existence. Same for books, movies, games, anime, and all sorts of fiction that we humans produce and consume.

For all these years, I've always asked myself. Is this my life? My mundane, joyless, disappointing existence... is there all it is? Where's the adventure? The excitement? The relationships? The adrenaline rush? But now I've come to realize that real life isn't a novel, movie or video game where the main character is destined for an adventure. No. Instead, real life is inherently mundane and disappointing, and that is exactly why fiction and escapism have existed since antiquity, when we talked of legendary demigods and heroes going on adventures and performing feats that are impossible in real life.

It is a very humbling and grounding realization that work-eat-sleep-repeat is the default for all of us humans, and that there is no grander adventure or fun that awaits us other than the terrifying curveballs life likes to occasionally throw our way. As for the loneliness, FOMO since childhood, and restlessness of feeling that I'm not living life to the fullest? Unfortunately, that is also the nature of real life.

There are no grand childhood escapedes where you and your childhood friends sneak into places you aren't supposed to go to; there are no mischevious teenage adventures where you make out with your teenage girlfriend who deliberately dressed up in an extra skimpy outfit just for you in an abandoned building while you drink beer and count the stars; there are no cool friendships of where you and your comrades go explore the most remote and uninhabited regions in the world; hell, there aren't even fun parties where you can laugh away at your hearts content while you fumblingly attemp to impress your giggling crush with the latest magic trick you've learnt online.

None, those are dreams and unrealistic expectations only that are sold to us via social media and fiction. What is in reality is instead acceptance of the mundane and disappointing nature of life while making peace and finding contentment in it by finding joy in the mundane through the small things we have in life. A warm mug of coffee, morning birdsong, buttered toast as breakfast, the sunset view, a funny post on social media, a good book to cuddle in with, a peaceful, quiet night.",1,1762314876.0,changemyview,2,0.6,False

1oost1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/livingfromtheend/comments/1oost1w/day_3_of_72_hour_reality_shift/,DAY 3 OF 72 HOUR REALITY SHIFT,"**Day 3 - Becoming the New You**

**Focus: Stabilising the Shift**

Hey, you’ve made it to Day 3, this is where the magic starts to feel more real. If the first two days were about deciding what you want and shifting how you feel inside, today is where you actually start living as your new self.

It’s not about faking it, it’s about letting the *real you* rise to the surface. The you who already has what they want. The you who walks lighter, smiles easier, and moves through life with quiet certainty.

**Why Day Three is the Day You Stop “Trying” and Start “Being”**

Let’s keep this simple.  
Think of it like this:

* **Day 1 = planting the seed**
* **Day 2 = watering the seed**
* **Day 3 = becoming the tree**

This is where you **stabilise the new version of you**, so it becomes your new normal.

***This is when you start walking around knowing you own the tree. Even if it hasn’t broken through the soil yet, you know it’s there. You start living like it’s yours.***

This is the energy that changes everything. You stop acting like someone *hoping* to manifest something… and you start behaving like someone who simply *expects* it, because it’s done.

**Why Stabilisation is Where Everything Shifts**

Here’s the real deal:  
“What you don’t stabilise, you keep fantasising.”

If you keep dipping in and out of your dream, visualising in the morning but worrying the rest of the day you stay stuck in limbo.

But when you stabilise, you build a home in the version of you who already has what they want. That energy becomes your new normal. And life will have no choice but to meet you there.

**Step 1: Building the Identity of “Already Me”**

Stop asking yourself, “How do I get this?” because that keeps you in chasing mode.

Start asking, “Who am I when I already have this?”

It’s a subtle but powerful shift. Think about it, how does the you who’s in love wake up in the morning? How does the you with financial freedom carry themselves? Would they be refreshing their phone for signs? Or would they be sipping coffee, smiling, knowing good things are inevitable?

Tiny Action for Today:  
Start noticing these little details. Step into that version of you, bit by bit, breath by breath. Make it natural.



**Step 2: Your 3 Anchors to Stay in That Identity**



**1. End-State Anchoring, Feel It in Your Bones**

Keep asking: “How would the version of me who already has this… stand, talk, text, breathe?”

* Straighten your back.
* Catch your inner talk and make it match your dream self.
* Drop words like “trying,” use “it’s done,” “I’m ready,” “it’s unfolding.”

Example affirmation to carry with you:  
“Everything is unfolding beautifully for me.”

Feel it. Let it sink into your muscles, your face, your posture. The version of you that’s living their dream doesn’t need to rush.



**2. Inner Mood Maintenance - Your Mood is the Magnet**

Your energy is what life listens to. Think: how does the version of you who *has it* feel most of the day? Calm? Grateful? Light?

So today, your focus isn’t just on moments of happiness, but on creating an **emotional home** in your dream life.

Gentle reminder:  
When doubts pop up (and they will), you don’t fight them. You simply notice and softly say, “That’s the old me… but I’m choosing again.”

Mood is a choice, not a task. And your new self feels good more often than not.



**3. Conscious Reaction Practice, Where You Grow the Fastest**

Here’s where real growth happens.  
Something annoying happens, an unexpected bill, a text left on read.  
Old you: panic, overthink.  
New you: pause… observe… choose differently.

The magic trick:  
Whenever you feel triggered, ask:  
“How does the version of me who already has this respond?”

That moment of choice will become your superpower.



**Step 3: The Simple Daily Rituals That Keep You in Flow**



**Morning Identity Activation**

Before touching your phone, stand tall in the mirror. Look into your eyes.  
“Today, I’m living as the version of me who already has \[desire\].”

Feel it. Visualise it for just 2 minutes. Smile like it’s happening now. End with:  
“I allow it. I accept it. I am it.”  
Simple. Quick. Powerful.



**Midday Self-Check-In**

Halfway through the day, check yourself, not to judge but to lovingly guide yourself back.  
“Who am I being right now?”

If you slipped, it’s okay. Smile. Shift. Choose again.



**Evening Gratitude & Identity Anchoring**

At night, write down three things where you stayed aligned, even if it’s just remembering once! Progress is progress.  
Then write a short thank you note to your future self:  
“Thank you for leading us through this shift.”  
Fall asleep in your dream energy. Let your subconscious carry it through the night.



**Step 4: How to Hold the State Even When “Nothing Happens”**

**Key Truth:**

“Nothing happening” is an illusion.  
Energy rearranges behind the scenes even when you don’t see it. Your job is to hold the energy steady.

*Let’s be honest, sometimes, reality stays still. Nothing seems to happen.*

This is where most people spiral.  
But not you. Because now you understand:  
“Quiet doesn’t mean nothing is happening. It means things are rearranging behind the scenes.”

Like a seed underground. Your job is to **hold your state**, not look for instant proof.

Here’s how to hold your state:

* Whisper “Regardless” when things wobble. “Regardless of what I see, it’s working.”
* Journal from your future. “It felt so natural when it arrived.”
* Focus more on your mood than external proof.
* Celebrate your inner shifts, they’re just as valuable as physical signs.



**Step 5: Let Go of “When” and “How” Fall in Love with Trust**

Letting go doesn’t mean giving up, it means releasing the pressure. It means relaxing into knowing.

It sounds like:  
“It’s mine. I don’t need to hover over it. I’m going to enjoy life while it arrives.”

Reminder:  
You don’t manifest with force. You manifest with **flow**.  
Your energy is your invitation. Calm trust is magnetic.



**Step 6: Celebration - Your Secret Shortcut**

Why wait to celebrate after it arrives? Celebrate now.  
Feel the joy now.  
This flips your energy from lack to abundance instantly.

Easy ways to celebrate:

* Morning thank-you’s as if it’s done.
* Smile after small wins and whisper: “I’m showing up for my dream life.”
* Walk taller, dress better, dance more, because you know it’s done.
* Before bed, imagine the celebration moment: the call, the message, the breakthrough.

The universe responds fastest to those who live from joy, not waiting for life to give permission.

**Gentle Closing Reminder:**

The old you might pop up. That’s okay.  
You might wobble. That’s okay.  
Just… keep… returning… home.

Today you don’t chase.  
Today you don’t beg.  
Today you live as the person who already has it.  
And life will catch up to *who you decide to be*.",5,1762314831.0,livingfromtheend,0,1.0,False

1oosswe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Panera/comments/1oosswe/extra_hot_cappuccino/,Extra hot cappuccino?,"Had this guy come in today and asked for an “extra hot cappuccino”. For context: I have worked at my location for three years and I am also a barista at my second job that specializes in craft coffee (yknow latte art and spending $8 on a 4 oz cortado). Our location also has a very basic espresso machine with an automatic steam wand (I can’t do shit with it cause it just streams milk to a certain temp and then shuts off). Knowing this and not wanting to disappoint him, I stupidly tried explaining that it was an automatic steam wand and shut off at a certain temp and even if I turned it back on, it would shut off instantly. In hindsight I should have just acknowledged his request, wrote it in, and made it someone else’s problem. He then goes “no, you guys have made it extra hot for me before” and then he says to my manager who is over the counter “you guys can make it extra hot like last time right?”. Said manager is like “oh yeah no problem we can do that”. So I’m like whatever and ring it in with this guy acting all smug. I go up to my manager and ask how we can possibly do that since the steam wand is automatic and they go “oh I know, I just move the wand around to make it more foamy, it’s not actually extra hot, he just thinks the foam makes it more hot”. So I’m annoyed cause this guy thinks he one upped me and is all smug about it thinking I don’t know anything when in reality he’s drinking foamy milk thinking it’s hotter for some reason. 
I understand this reads as a complaint - really just an annoying experience, but I do have a point with this: is there a way to change the temperature setting on these extremely primitive espresso machines? It literally only has a few buttons for different amounts of espresso shots, a button for cleaning, and a button for the steam wand 😭 I’m used to the fancy machines at my other job where we can actually control all that stuff.

I just wanted to create a post about my CCW class that I took this past weekend that PeteTinNY offers.

Basically, its a great class and a great experience overall, Pete is very friendly, and very knowledgeable about everything that is taught in the class, and he has no problem whatsoever spending some time after the class is finished to either answer more questions or just to offer help with anything about the CCW application process. 

The class itself is really a necessity because it opened my eyes to scenarios or dangerous activities that I never thought about, which is good because let's be honest, at the end of the day this is guns were talking about, a matter that should always be taken serious. 

The actual class site is in a mall, which I loved, its much better than sitting in a basic room at some range while you listen to shots being fired from day to night. Pete's class also utilizes simulated shooting on big projector screens, this definitely made the class just more fun and kept my attention. In my opinion, the best part was the bagels, munchkins, hot water and big jug of coffee that Pete had set up for on both days lol.

Pete, im sure youre going to read this lol, im very happy I chose your class over others, im very happy that I was able to meet some great people in the process, and I definitely will be back once my renewal is needed.

1oosqos,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1oosqos/need_advice/,Need Advice!,"Hello! I am hoping to hear some advice from some people Hello! This is my first time posting on Reddit so bear with me. Basically, I was romantically involved with this guy exactly 2 years ago. We matched on Hinge in September 2023 and started going on dates once a week and hanging out whenever we could as we lived about an hour away from one another. He was so kind and such a true gentleman and my friends loved him which is the biggest green flag for me lol. Things went on between us until about the middle of January of 2024 where I ultimately decided to end things with him. I was 18 at the time and living at home with my parents (still do lol) and that played a huge role in why I decided to end things. I was too scared to admit to them that I was actually seeing a boy, even though they know I’m gay, it’s just like an unspoken rule in our home to not talk about it. Anyway I had some bunds I had to figure out with myself and with my life and I just didn’t feel like it was fair to have him wait around while I figure my life out. That may sound silly, but it was true. I figured that I could just go ahead and let him down easily before I was in too deep. I let him down gently but I know he took it pretty harshly as he was also dealing with some personal things. Fast forward to June of 2024, about 5 months after we had last spoken, he reached out to see how I was doing and I ignored him. I honestly didn’t intentionally ignore him at first. I was out with some friends and had gotten his message and it had completely slipped my mind to respond until it was too late, I guess. Now that I’m typing this out I feel like a jerk lol. Anyway, I was also seeing someone at the time and had been for about a month so I also felt like my hands were tied behind my back a little bit, of that makes sense. So, I just never responded. Okay, now fast forward to November of 2024, he had been heavy on my mind one morning for some strange reason, so I decided to reach out and message him. I honestly just wanted to let him know that I was truly sorry for the way that things ended and that I acknowledge the fact that I could’ve handled things differently. He responded quickly and said that he forgave me and that it was nice to hear from me and whatnot, but, he also informed me that he was indeed in a relationship and had been for a few months. I wasn’t really reaching out in hopes of rekindling our relationship, more so just to let him know that I am truly sorry and that I had hoped he was doing okay. Despite telling me he was in a relationship, he mentioned us meeting up and going to get coffee or something like that, I kind of just ignored that sort of the message and really focused on the part where he informed me about him being in a relationship. I replied and let him know that I was not reaching out in hopes of getting into another romantic relationship with him so that wasn’t really a big deal. He then, again, brought up us doing something together soon. It was almost like he was insisting that we did something, perhaps I am/was looking too far into it I don’t know. Anyway, after that conversation, we didn’t speak again for a while. About a month ago, towards the beginning of October, he messaged me a memory from his Snapchat memories and it was a photo of me from one of our little “dates,” if that’s that you want to call it. I was over the moon to hear from him as it had been almost a year of me wondering if he was still in a relationship or not. out there about a predicament I’ve found myself in.

I let him down gently but I know he took it pretty harshly as he was also dealing with some personal things. Fast forward to June of 2024, about 5 months after we had last spoken, he reached out to see how I was doing and I ignored him. I honestly didn’t intentionally ignore him at first. I was out with some friends and had gotten his message and it had completely slipped my mind to respond until it was too late, I guess. Now that I’m typing this out I feel like a jerk lol. Anyway, I was also seeing someone at the time and had been for about a month so I also felt like my hands were tied behind my back a little bit, if that makes sense. So, I just never responded. Okay, now fast forward to November of 2024, he had been heavy on my mind one morning for some strange reason, so I decided to reach to him. I honestly just wanted to let him know that I was truly sorry for the way that things ended and that I acknowledge the fact that I could’ve handled things differently. He responded quickly and said that he forgave me and that it was nice to hear from me and whatnot, but, he also informed me that he was indeed in a relationship and had been for a few months. I wasn’t really reaching out in hopes of rekindling our relationship, more so just to let him know that I was sorry and that I had hoped he was doing okay. Despite telling me he was in a relationship, he mentioned us meeting up and going to get coffee or something like that, I kind of just ignored that part of the message and really focused on the part where he informed me about him being in a relationship. I replied and let him know that I was not reaching out in hopes of getting into another romantic relationship with him so that wasn’t really a big deal. He then, again, brought up us doing something together soon. It was almost like he was insisting that we did something, perhaps I am/was looking too far into it I don’t know. Anyway, after that conversation, we didn’t speak again for a while. About a month ago, towards the beginning of October, he messaged me a memory from his Snapchat memories and it was a photo of me from one of our little “dates,” if that’s that you want to call it. I was over the moon to hear from him as it had been almost a year since I had heard from him. Granted, I could have reached out, but I was under the impression that he was in a relationship, therefore I didn’t feel a reason to. He initially messaged me at about 2pm and from that point on we just chatted and caught up for the rest of the evening. I haven’t heard from him since that day. This evening, I went out with a couple friends and we were just sitting around reminiscing on our crazy lives and everything that’s happened. He got brought up because the two friends I was with adored him and thought the world of him. They always tell me how much they miss him and how good of a pair him and I were. After our dinner, I decided to check his Instagram, and to my surprise, his profile picture that he has had of him and the boy that I assumed was his boyfriend, had changed after probably about a year. The boy is no longer in his profile photo. This could very well mean nothing and I could totally be delusional which is very likely. Seeing the profile picture change makes me wonder if he’s still with that boy. All of that to say, I guess I’m just looking for a second or third opinion on this whole mess. I feel like I miss him but I can’t decide if I actually miss him or the idea of him. Also, do you guys think it means anything that he’s still reaching out after all this time?

1oosq4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/1oosq4l/stranger_reloaded_my_dads_rifle_but_my_dad_doesnt/,"stranger reloaded my dad's rifle, but my dad doesn't believe it wasn't me","A couple years ago, my dad (then 43M), my half-brother (then 7M) and myself (then 16F) went on a hunting/camping trip together. I'm currently 18.

We took my dad's hilux and drove up into the highlands in Victoria (I live in Australia) for a long weekend so my dad could go hunting. My sister was at our mum's house, my step-brother with his mum's house (my stepmother, my half-brother's mum), so it was just my dad, my half-brother and I. (let's call him Tim)

We took a 2-person tent, a swag, an Eski and some food. We also brought 2 of my dad's hunting rifles. My dad had worked in the ADF for 20+ years but left it a couple months before this trip, and also does a lot of hunting/shooting with his friends, which is why he had a licence.

Obviously, this isn't America, and few people have even seen a rifle let alone own a gun, so we kept them hidden in the backseat of the car to not scare anyone. People get really freaked out around them, which is fair if you haven't grown up with hunting fans. We've had the police called on us before when carrying them out to cars. The important thing here is that no one on the drive over or in the suburb we went to knew my dad had rifles with us.

We spent the first day hanging out around the woods. My dad was teaching my brother and I to shoot, and we used an old coffee cup to practice our aim. He made sure there was no one around and that we were alone before doing it. it was actually a lot of fun. Tim and I made tree forts and then the three of us had dinner and went to bed.

My dad slept in the swag and Tim and I in the tent. My dad locked the guns in the car, but didn't hide them. We were completely alone in the camping spot (we don't like to share campsites, people always blast music) so he didn't have any reason to hide them. 

He locked the car and put the keys in his swag. I know because it was me who did it, because he was trying to get Tim in his pj's and asked me to make sure the car was locked, then just throw the keys into the swag. They landed near his pillow.

We all went to sleep after that, but i woke up at around 2am because i could hear someone moving around. We have a lot of small mammals in australia and I assumed this was a koala or a possum digging around, but then I heard footsteps and I realised it was a person. 

I've listened to true crime podcasts since the beginning of year 7, so my first instinct was ""oh my gosh it's ted bundy this is the end"", so i didn't leave the tent. I did open the zip a tiny bit, just enough for me to peek out of it without the person seeing me. 

I saw my dad moving around, fiddling with something in the car. Picture the back door open, the item on the back seat, and him standing and using the seat as a bench. he was wearing what looked like jeans and a puffer jacket, and a yellow cap. He took the hat off while I was watching him because it kept slipping down on his face. I stopped freaking out then, because it's my dad, and zipped the tent back up quietly and went back to bed. 

  
But in the morning, when we all got up, i realised that the door to the car was open. it was the same door that i'd seen my dad standing at early that morning. 

Instead of him going ""oh whoops forgot to close that"", dad got angry and asked me why i had been stuffing around with his rifles in the night. I was really confused, because I hadn't. He didn't believe me, and said that someone had open the car door and re-loaded the rifles, and since Tim doesn't know how, it had to have been me.

It was at this point that I told my dad it was him who had opened the car door, not me. I repeated my story about him waking me up in the night and how I looked out of the tent and saw him fiddling with something at 2am. 

He accused me of lying, but I swore that i hadn't done it. I think he didn't believe me because a) I was the one who locked the car, and b) i do actually know how to re-load the rifles. It made a lot of sense to say I did it - I would have thought it was me as well had I not seen him at the car at 2am. 

We ended up leaving the campsite that morning anyway, because one of dad's work friends call in sick and he had to come in. But on the drive home I was helping Tim to get a spiderman toy that had fallen under the front passenger seat, and i grabbed something made of fabric. 

it was the freaking yellow cap my dad had been wearing that night!!!! I thought this was going to prove i wasn't lying, because he would remember taking it off because it kept slipping.

but then I realised - it *wasn't* my dad's cap. He doesn't even own a yellow cap. And there were short brown hairs stuck in the Velcro strap at the back. My dad is so bald his head reflects the sunlight, and all of my siblings have red or blonde hair. 

I showed it to him and he admitted that it wasn't his hat. but he wasn't willing to believe me when i told him the man i saw must have been a stranger. he still thinks it was me. 



It's been two years since this happened, and he still refuses to believe that i saw a stranger at our campsite that night. I'm mostly confused as to what the heck that person was doing and i have so many questions. Where was their car? how did they know my dad had his rifles with him? how did he get the car unlocked? what was he planning to do once he loaded the rifles and why didn't he do it?

Anyway, i know it wasn't Tim, dad or I. It was a strange man. but i have no idea why

Now I don’t know where this person came from but all of a sudden they are always working there—always remember my order, never charge me more than $2–

Our conversations—though relatively brief, sometimes excitedly rambling almost always loop back to Unsolved Mysteries, and episode recommendations. 

There has also been: 1-firm hand shake, 1-crisp high five. And a couple moments of ‘it’s the middle of a rush but you still have my undivided attention’. I almost always make him laugh, but always get nervous and leave abruptly. Thank you anxiety.

A few days before Halloween I recommended going as Robert Stack (the king).

Upon stopping in a day or two ago he proudly informed me that he had followed through, trench coat and all. (Ok, wonderboy).

The model names are so confusing to me.

- Is there a model with a higher water capacity than a Magnifica?

- We both like strong coffee. 
- We don't need anything super fancy but the option of cold coffee would be nice as summer is coming up in Australia 

I'm stuck on whether to get a newer Magnifica Evo or Start, or for around the same price get an older Dinamica Plus ($300-500 AUD) - is there a significant difference?

Wondering if anyone here knows anything about this plant. I've been interested in it because obviously it's a total trip out that we have our own native coffee species, and nothing is known about it. 

Now, I am aware there are dozens of coffea species and only a handful have been demonstrated to contain caffeine, and even less have much cultivation and consumption potential. But there are probably more out there to be discovered. 

So the history of the Brassii is a bit complicated, youll read different accounts and it started off with the nomenclature Psilanthus brassi. It was probably noted on some of the later Continental expidetions and seems to have beern rediscovered a few times but it's been known to modern science since the early 2000's (this is my summation of what I've read - don't quote me). 

 Anyway, one article I read from around 2010 was discussing how we knew little about it, and we didn't know if it contains caffeine. Okay great, but it's been 15 years and I'm just like, what do you mean we still don't know if it contains caffeinel? That's not even a difficult test! Wouldn't it be amazing if it did (probably won't as Coffea species tend to increase in caffeine the closer geograhically you get to the African natives.. but maybe?)  

I've searched Google scholar and there's some analysis of leaf and genetic material, but just dont understand why no one has thrown a bean in an NMR spectroscopy or a HPLC machine ?? Like you don't even have to do that to determine caffeine you can literally buy of the shelf caffeine analysis machines (coffee nerds do it all the time). 

Additionally, most other Coffea species do quiet well propogating from cuttings.


Does anyone else not think this is a fascinating black hole in our native plant knowledge? Am I missing something as a non academic interested in this. I mean there's only like 3 blurry photos of it on the internet. 

Does anyone know anything about this plant? Please help me because if it's determined that am, in fact, not missing something, then I may fly up to Cooktown to search for one - seems like a fun adventure and I could potentially put the caffeine mystery to rest.

I’m going to be staying with my son in the East Village in mid-December for a few nights and I need somewhere to work on a Friday morning. I normally WFH and will have all my own “gear” but I need to find a space that I can set up for the day and have the freedom to do video calls (with a headset of course). 

I’ve read some people work from coffee shops or the library, but I find that I’m self conscious on video calls in a space that public (and either it’s too loud or too quiet for me to be on a call). I’m more than happy to pay a fee for a space, I’m just not familiar with the amenities in the area and would love some recommendations.

My son’s apartment is on 3rd St and 1st ave and I’d like somewhere I could walk to from there. I appreciate any suggestions!",1,1762313520.0,eastvillage,2,0.67,False

They serve good coffee and world food that actually hits the spot. The music’s nice too, not too loud, just the kind that makes you want to stay longer.

Also the view from the second floor is really nice.

Perfect for introverts like me, or for couples who want a bit of privacy.

1oos31g,https://i.redd.it/2he4qxjgwczf1.jpeg,Link plzz - Regret After Divorce: I Lost the Best Her,"Scarlett’s POV
“Miss Taylor, did you come alone? Why don’t you call your husband?”
The doctor glanced at the report in her hand, then looked up at me with eyes full of pity.
That look. That damn look.
For the past few months, I’d had constant stomach pain. At first, I brushed it off, popping painkillers like candy to get through the day. I told myself it was probably just stress or diet—something temporary. But the pain had grown worse… unbearable. So, today, I finally dragged myself to the hospital.
I thought I’d walk out with some prescriptions and rest orders.
Not this.
“I’m already divorced,” I said firmly, lifting my chin. “So just tell me the truth.”
I had signed the divorce papers this morning. My hands had trembled slightly, but my resolve was steady. There was no point holding on to a marriage that had already withered. And even if I hadn’t signed them, Everett wouldn’t have come. He hadn’t shown up for me in months.
The doctor hesitated. “Miss Taylor… based on the test results… You have stomach cancer.”
My breath caught. The room felt suddenly cold. I clutched the arms of the chair, my heartbeat thundering in my ears.
“It’s… already at the last stage.”
Her words crashed over me like a tidal wave. Cold. Merciless. Crushing.
Last stage.
I didn’t remember how I left the room. I just remembered the test reports digging into my hand, crumpling under the pressure of my clenched fist.
My feet led me to the hospital lobby like I was sleepwalking, my vision swimming. And then, a voice from the television snapped me back into the real world.
“Breaking news: Famous ballerina Amelia Martin was injured after a fall from the stage earlier today. She was quickly taken to the hospital by an unknown man—”
The screen flickered, showing a blurry video clip of a man carrying her. His face wasn’t visible. But I didn’t need to see his face.
I knew him by the curve of his shoulders. The way he walked. The way his hand cradled her head so protectively.
Everett Robinson.
My husband. The man I had loved since my youth. The man I had shared three years of marriage with. The same man who looked me in the eyes this morning and said coldly, “I don’t have time for your nonsense, Scarlett. I have an important meeting.”
But he had time for her.
I stared at the screen as my heart twisted. Pain bloomed in my chest—far worse than anything the doctor had just told me. I clutched the test reports tighter. My nails dug into the paper, but the real wound was inside.
Tears blurred my vision, uninvited and unwanted. I blinked them away, furious at myself for still caring.
I had loved him so deeply. And he had already replaced me.
Enough.
I wiped my tears and inhaled deeply, steadying the storm in my chest. I didn’t have time for heartbreak. Not anymore.
I had only a few months left to live.
And I refused to spend them crying over a man who couldn’t even take me to the hospital.
The taxi stopped outside Heavenly, the most luxurious beauty salon in the city. For years, I’d had their VIP Black Card sitting in my wallet—untouched. I never used it once during our marriage. I was too busy cooking, cleaning, and being the perfect wife.
But today? Today, I would use it. For me.
I walked in, head high.
“Good afternoon, Madam. Do you have an appointment?” the receptionist asked politely.
“Yes.”
“Your name, please?”
“Scarlett Taylor.”
The moment she typed it in, her expression shifted. “Ah, Miss Taylor. You’re fifteen minutes early. Please wait in the lounge, and I’ll have someone bring you refreshments.”
I nodded and moved toward the plush velvet seating. A few young women were already seated there, chatting animatedly. I wasn’t interested in their gossip—until I heard that name.
“Did you see the latest news about Amelia Martin?” one of them giggled.
“Yes! The guy who carried her to the hospital like a princess? So romantic!” another swooned.
“I heard from someone inside WS Group that it was Everett Robinson! Can you believe it? The CEO himself?”
“Oh my god, he’s so dreamy. Rich, handsome, and now this? Amelia is so lucky. I would die to marry someone like that.”
I closed my eyes.
Lucky?
They didn’t know him. They didn’t know the cold, detached man who would leave his sick wife alone but rush across the city to cradle another woman like she was made of glass.
I let out a bitter laugh under my breath, catching their attention briefly. One of them glanced at me, confused, but I ignored her.
Lucky?
No. I was the lucky one.
Lucky to finally be free of a man who could never love me the way I loved him.
I pulled the test results from my purse, unfolded them slowly, and stared at the cold, printed words again.
Stomach carcinoma. Stage IV.
Death was already knocking at my door, and yet… I’d never felt more alive than I did now—ready to shed the old Scarlett who waited, begged, hoped, and cried.
It was time to live on my own terms, even if the time left was short.
Let Everett play hero in someone else’s story.
I had just begun to write the ending of mine.
And this time—it would be mine alone.
Scarlett’s POV
“Miss Taylor, it’s your turn.”
The receptionist’s voice cut through my thoughts, gently anchoring me back to the present.
I blinked, then nodded and stood up, the crumpled test reports still tucked inside my purse like a ghost I couldn’t shake off. But not now. Not in this place.
I followed the attendant down a quiet hallway and into a private room bathed in soft, golden light and the faint scent of jasmine. The stylist was already waiting inside—young, elegant, her hands folded politely.
“Madam,” she asked kindly, “what kind of look would you like?”
I stared at my reflection.
The woman in the mirror looked tired. Drained. A ghost of who she used to be. My skin was pale, my eyes dulled, and my long, dark hair—once my pride—hung limp and lifeless around my shoulders. There was a hollow in my chest that no amount of makeup could hide.
But my voice was steady when I spoke.
“I want to change everything. My hair. My face. My entire look. I don’t care how long it takes.”
The stylist looked slightly startled but nodded. I met her eyes through the mirror and added, more quietly this time, “Make me look like a different person. Someone… reborn.”
There was a pause. And then she smiled gently. “Understood.”
As she turned to begin, I took one last long look at the woman in the mirror.
Scarlett Taylor—the woman who waited at cold dinner tables, who stayed up at night wondering if a man would ever come home, who fought for love and dignity only to be met with silence—she was gone.
Dead.
And in her place, someone new would rise.
No more tears. No more waiting. No more Everett.
I didn’t have forever. But whatever days I had left, I would spend them as me—not as someone’s wife, someone’s afterthought, someone’s shadow.
Just me.
Scarlett Taylor.
And this time, I would finally learn what it meant to live.
I closed my eyes.
My thoughts drifted, unbidden, to a memory buried four years deep.
Back when everything began… or perhaps, when everything started to end.
Four years ago, Everett Robinson was in a car crash.
I still remember the headlines. “The CEO of WS Group in Critical Condition!”
The whole city was on edge. People whispered, speculated. Doctors weren’t sure he’d survive the night, let alone ever walk again.
And Amelia Martin—his first love, the woman everyone thought would never leave his side—disappeared.
Just like that.
Gone.
She boarded a plane abroad, chasing dreams far more dazzling than a hospital room.
She loved him, sure—when he was whole, powerful, magnetic. But her love wasn’t for the broken. It wasn’t for someone lying unconscious, tubes in his veins and scars on his face.
But me?
I stayed.
No one asked me to. In fact, they begged me not to.
“You’re ruining your future,” they warned.
“He doesn’t love you,” they whispered.
But I didn’t care. I left behind everything—my rising career, the weight of the Taylor family name, my bright future. I packed a bag and moved into the hospital.
I slept on stiff ICU chairs. Fed him. Bathed him. Read to him when he couldn’t hear me. Talked to him when he couldn’t respond. I became his shadow. His silent anchor. His ghost of hope.
And maybe… God had heard my prayers. Because after nearly a year, he opened his eyes.
When his lashes fluttered and he whispered my name, I laughed and cried and collapsed to the floor in relief.
That moment felt like the beginning of everything.
Like maybe… just maybe… my love had reached him.
A few months later, when he was fully recovered, he looked at me and asked softly, “What do you want, Scarlett?”
I should’ve said, “I want you to be happy.”
I should’ve said, “I want to be free.”
But I was foolish. I smiled—wide-eyed and hopeful—and whispered, “I want to marry you.”
I saw it—the flicker of hesitation in his eyes.
I felt it—the silence that stretched between us.
But I ignored it. Because even if I had only his name and not his heart, I thought it would be enough.
The next day, he took me to the marriage registration office.
No vows. No flowers. No ring.
Just a government form, a silent assistant, and a pen.
He didn’t kiss me.
He didn’t even look at me when the papers were stamped.
On the ride back, he simply said, “Keep our marriage private.”
I nodded. My lips trembled. But I didn’t protest.
Because back then… I thought that if I stayed long enough, worked hard enough, loved hard enough… he would choose me.
I moved into Green Lake Villa—his villa. Our supposed “marital home.”
I cleaned. I decorated. I transformed it from a cold mansion into a warm sanctuary.
But Everett never truly came home.
He was polite. Always distant. Always cold.
Three years of marriage—yet the days he actually stayed with me… I could count on one hand.
I woke up early to iron his shirts, packed his lunch, managed his schedule, cooked his favorite meals. I waited at the dinner table night after night… only for silence to answer me.
But I endured.
Because I believed—so stupidly—that one day he would look at me the way he once looked at her.
Then one day, he took me to a formal party.
I remember the rush of joy in my chest.
I thought—finally. He’s acknowledging me.
But when he introduced me, he said, “This is Scarlett. My personal secretary.”
I smiled. My heart bled. But I smiled.
Because at least I was still standing beside him.
Day after day, I lived in the shadow of another woman.
Amelia Martin — the ghost that never left his heart.
Still, I gave everything.
My dignity. My youth. My identity.
All for a man who never asked me to… and never thanked me.
Then, three months ago, everything shattered.
Amelia came back.
She returned from abroad, glowing, beautiful, radiant. And Everett…
Everett went to pick her up himself.
There were photos. Videos. Rumors.
They said they were dating. Said marriage was on the horizon.
That night, I prepared his favorite dinner. Lit the hallway with soft lights. Sprayed his favorite cologne like I always did.
And I waited.
Like a fool.
He came home late, smelling faintly of her perfume.
And something inside me—finally—snapped.
For the first time in three years, I confronted him.
“Everett,” I said, my voice shaking. “Can’t you see what you’re doing to me? I gave up everything for you! When you were broken, I was there. She left you! I stayed!”
I spilled every word I had buried. All the pain. All the silence. All the bleeding I had done for his love.
He looked at me, calm and cold.
“You have no right to ask.”
Those five words shattered everything inside me.
I broke.
I screamed. I sobbed. I shouted things I never thought I’d say. I told him how Amelia left. How I stayed. How I waited. How I endured.
And Everett?
He just looked at me.
Expressionless.
Then he said three words.
“Then let’s divorce.”
No explanation.
No apology.
No guilt.
He walked out, leaving me crumbling to the floor—broken and alone, my cries echoing through the walls of a house that had never felt like home.
The next morning, the first set of divorce papers arrived.
I didn’t sign.
Then came the second.
And the third.
Ten sets in total.
Each envelope like a slap.
Each signature line a reminder that I was just a temporary stand-in…
Until she came back.
That’s when I finally understood.
If a man doesn’t love you, no matter how much of yourself you give, he never will.
Looking at the final envelope, I took a deep breath.
It was time.
Time to end this one-sided, fruitless relationship.
Time to choose me.
Scarlett’s POV
“Madam, it’s done.”
The stylist’s voice pulled me from my thoughts. Slowly, I opened my eyes and looked into the mirror.
And froze.
The woman staring back at me wasn’t the same Scarlett Taylor who walked into this salon an hour ago.
Gone was the soft, obedient wife with dull eyes and a timid posture.
This woman had sharp eyes lined with quiet fire. Her long hair had been chopped into a sleek, shoulder-length cut that framed her face like a crown. Her lips were a bold shade of red—confident, unapologetic. Even her expression had changed. Steady. Unyielding. Dignified.
For a second, I didn’t recognize myself.
And for the first time in years… I liked what I saw.
“I look…” I whispered, touching the mirror lightly, “…free.”
The stylist smiled. “You look powerful, Miss Taylor.”
I nodded. “Thank you.”
I paid the bill, left a generous tip, and walked outside. The afternoon sun kissed my face as a warm breeze played with the ends of my new hair. I stepped to the edge of the sidewalk, pulling out my phone to book a taxi.
Ding.
A message.
I opened it without thinking.
It was a photo.
My heart skipped once.
A hospital document. I squinted—no. A test result.
Then I saw the words:
Pregnancy Confirmation. 4 weeks.
Name: Amelia Martin
Father: Everett Robinson
And beneath it, a message.
Scarlett, so what if you married him?
He never loved you.
You were just keeping his place warm for me.
Now I’m carrying his child.
If you have even a shred of dignity left, sign the divorce papers and leave.
The air around me seemed to still. Cars passed. The breeze fluttered. Life moved on.
But inside me, everything… stopped.
I stood there, the phone heavy in my hand. My chest tightened. My stomach churned—not with jealousy, but with a hollow ache that no words could fill.
He was going to be a father. And it wasn’t my child.
It was hers.
Amelia.
The woman who left him in a hospital bed to chase her own dreams. The woman who vanished when things got hard. The woman whose return burned everything I had built for three long years.
And now… she had everything.
His heart.
His attention.
His child.
A dull pain throbbed beneath my ribs. It crawled up my throat, threatening to choke me.
But I swallowed it back.
No more tears.
No more begging.
No more pretending I was fine.
I stared at the message for a long second, then typed just three words.
Then congratulations.
I hit send.
Then I turned off my phone, slipped it into my purse, and raised my hand to flag a taxi.
The yellow car pulled up. The driver leaned out. “Where to, ma’am?”
I slid into the back seat, my voice calm and clear.
“To WS Group.”
I stared out the window as the city blurred by.
There was still one thing left to settle.
****
Everett Robinson’s POV
The temperature in the conference room seemed to plummet the moment I walked in.
I could feel the tension coiled tight in the air as I took my seat at the head of the table. The executives stiffened. A few lowered their eyes to the polished mahogany surface like schoolchildren caught misbehaving. One director dropped his pen and didn’t even dare to bend down for it.
Good. Let them squirm.
I steepled my fingers, my suit jacket pulling taut across my shoulders. The faint tick of the clock grated on my nerves.
I was irritated. No—agitated.
This wasn’t because of some failed merger or a market dip. I could handle those in my sleep. This was different.
Scarlett Taylor hadn’t come to work.
Not only that, she hadn’t answered my calls. Or my texts. Or the email I sent at 3 AM.
Three years. Three damn years as my personal secretary and she had never taken a single day off. Never been late. Never ignored me. She was reliable to a fault—quiet, efficient, unobtrusive, always there when I needed her.
And now? Vanished.
My jaw tightened. The coffee in front of me had gone cold. Not that I had touched it anyway. I hadn’t touched anything all morning.
Someone cleared their throat at the far end of the table. I shot them a look and the sound died instantly.
Scarlett… what the hell are you doing?
I pulled out my phone under the table, thumb hovering over her name. Maybe I should call again—
Click.
The door opened.
Every head in the room turned.
And so did mine.
A woman stepped in.
“I’m sorry, everyone, for disturbing like this.”
The voice froze me.
Scarlett?
I blinked. My mind couldn’t reconcile what I was seeing.
This wasn’t the Scarlett Taylor I knew.
Gone was the demure woman who wore plain blouses, hair tied back in a lazy ponytail, hiding behind thick-rimmed glasses.
This Scarlett…
Her hair was loose, long black waves cascading down her back like a silken waterfall. Her eyes—free of glasses—were striking and clear, sharp enough to cut through the silence in the room.
Her lips were painted in a deep rose color that made her look almost… untouchable.
Her figure was wrapped in a tailored suit that hugged every curve with a deliberate elegance. She didn’t walk. She strode. Confident. Purposeful. Heels clicking like punctuation in the thick, suffocating air.
It wasn’t just her appearance.
Her aura had changed.
She wasn’t hiding anymore.
Even the board members, men twice her age and status, stared at her with wide eyes.
And me?
I couldn’t look away.
After three years of marriage, I thought I knew Scarlett inside and out. She had always been soft and quiet, the perfect picture of composure and discipline. At the office, sleek black skirts and neutral blouses. At home, floral dresses and gentle smiles.
But this woman?
This wasn’t the Scarlett I married.
This was someone else.
She looked straight at me.
And for the first time, her gaze didn’t hold warmth. Or tenderness. Or the quiet affection I had grown so used to seeing.
It was cold. Indifferent.
Something in my chest tightened, sharp and unfamiliar.
Fear?
No. It couldn’t be.
“What the hell is she playing at?” I muttered under my breath.
The murmurs in the room were nothing but static in my ears.
Scarlett walked toward me, unhurried, unflinching. And I didn’t move. Couldn’t.
She stopped just a foot away.
From her bag, she pulled out a crisp envelope and held it out.
“Mr. Robinson,” she said, voice calm and cool. “This is my resignation.”
For a moment, I thought I’d misheard.
The silence in the room was deafening.
I didn’t take the envelope. My hand stayed by my side, clenched into a fist.
“You think throwing a tantrum is going to change anything?” I hissed.
Her eyes didn’t waver.
“I’m not throwing one,” she replied. Her voice was like a blade—sharp and precise.
Before I could speak, she reached into her bag again.
Thud.
A thick folder slammed against my chest. The sound echoed off the walls.
I caught it by reflex, the weight almost making me drop it.
Papers slipped out, scattering across the floor.
Divorce papers.
My breath hitched. My pulse stopped.
Scarlett looked at me, chin tilted high.
“Since you’ve been so eager to send them,” she said, “I’ve saved you the trouble.”
The edges of the folder crumpled in my grip.
“I’ve signed every copy,” she added. “Ten, to match the ten times you reminded me how disposable I am.”
My throat closed. Words wouldn’t come.
“Please clear your schedule tomorrow, 8:30 AM. Civil Bureau. Let’s get this over with.”
Then she turned.
No hesitation. No second glance.
Her heels clicked against the floor as she walked out, her hair swaying like a final flourish.
The room stayed frozen long after she was gone.
And I—
I stood there, fists clenched, heart pounding like a war drum.
For the first time in years, I realized—
Scarlett was really leaving me.
And I had no idea how to stop her.
Scarlett’s POV:
As I stepped out of the conference room, a loud crash echoed behind me. Maybe Everett had smashed something against the wall.
Seconds later, I heard Davis’s panicked voice from inside, hurriedly announcing that the meeting was over.
What a dramatic scene that must’ve been. Just imagining it gave me a strange thrill.
But honestly? I couldn’t care less anymore.
From this moment on, anything related to Everett Robinson no longer concerns me.
****
After leaving WS—White Stone—, I headed straight to the hotel.
I’d already moved out of the villa we once shared.
There wasn’t much to pack—just a few clothes, my ID, passport, and the things I’d brought with me when I first came to Los Angeles.
Love had made me cross an ocean. And now, pain was pushing me away with nothing in hand.
I had just sunk into the couch in my hotel room when my phone buzzed.
Davis Morgan.
I hesitated for a moment, thumb hovering over the answer button. But in the end, I picked up.
There were still some loose ends that needed to be tied up, and he was the only one who could do it.
“Mrs. Robinson,” Davis greeted politely.
He was the only one who knew about our hidden marriage.
“Davis,” I said calmly. “Good timing. I was just about to call you. I’ve left the keys to the villa with property management.”
There was a pause on the other end, as if he didn’t know how to respond.
“Mrs. Robinson... are you really going through with this?”
I let out a soft, bitter chuckle. “You think I’m just throwing a tantrum?”
“Well… It’s just that you’ve always cared about Mr. Robinson,” he replied, cautiously choosing his words.
I didn’t dislike Davis.
In fact, over the last three years, he was one of the few people who had treated me decently.
So hearing him say that made me pause. Just for a second.
I had given up everything for Everett—crossed borders, changed my life, bet everything on love…
And what did I get in return?
Lies. Distance. And silence that cut deeper than any scream.
Maybe this was heaven’s way of teaching me a brutal lesson:
Love that only goes one way… never ends well.
“It was love,” I said quietly. “But that’s in the past now.”
I glanced down at my left hand—the faint mark of the wedding ring still lingered on my finger.
“The ring’s in the nightstand drawer,” I added. “Everything Everett ever gave me after our marriage… I left it behind.”
Then I paused before finishing, “If he doesn’t want to show up tomorrow, you can come in his place. That works too.”
Given Everett Robinson’s power, it wouldn’t be hard for him to pull some strings.
I didn’t wait for a reply. I hung up without hesitation.
Everett’s POV:
I stood behind my desk, motionless.
Sunlight streamed through the tall glass windows, casting long shadows across the room. My lean frame was bathed in light, yet the air around me felt frigid.
I had asked Davis to call Scarlett, finding out what she was planning.
However, after Davis reported me what she said, I was confused. I didn’t know what stunt she was pulling this time.
On the desk in front of me lay a stack of divorce papers—ten copies.
All signed. By Scarlett.
I had asked Davis to draft them all the same:
Full divorce. No claims. She walks away with nothing.
I know she wouldn't sign. No sane woman would sign something that harsh.
I was sure she’d back out.
Wasn’t marrying me all about the money in the first place?
But she signed them.
All of them.
Just walked away—empty-handed and silent.
Was this some kind of reverse psychology game?
Fine. Let’s see how far she can play this.
****
The Next Morning – Civil Affairs Bureau
Scarlett arrived sharp at 8:00 a.m.
I sat in a different car, parked just down the street by 8:10.
From the back seat, I watched her through the window.
Her newly dyed golden hair was pulled into a high ponytail, the ends curled slightly, the crown fluffed just enough to give her that chic doll-like edge.
The soft peachy makeup on her small, delicate face made her look years younger.
She wore a rainbow off-shoulder crop top paired with a vintage, ripped denim skirt that barely reached her mid-thigh. Her legs—long and fair—were highlighted by plain white college sneakers.
She looked like a high schooler playing dress-up.
But she was here to get a divorce.
With me.
From 8:00 to 9:00, she waited.
She kept checking her phone every few minutes.
A few random guys approached her during that hour, throwing out lines, trying to get her number.
She shot them all down with a cold glare and a sharp tongue.
No nonsense. No smiles.
I narrowed my eyes as another one dared to walk over. My jaw tightened. My fingers curled into fists.
Davis’s POV:
I sat silently in the driver’s seat, watching the same scene unfold through the front windshield.
It was nearing 9:30. The June heat was already unbearable—pushing 40 degrees.
“Mr. Robinson,” I began cautiously, “Mrs. Robinson has been standing out there for quite a while—”
A sharp glare from the rearview mirror cut me off.
“What?” he snapped, voice ice-cold. “Feeling sorry for her now?”
I swallowed hard and turned my eyes back to the road.
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him unlock his phone and tap into the weather app.
38 degrees.
Even with tinted glass, I could see the irritation in his expression tighten.
A few seconds passed.
“Drive over.”
His voice was low, clipped.
“Yes, sir,” I replied and started the engine.
Scarlett’s POV
I was already getting fed up. Sweat beaded at my temples, the sun blazing mercilessly over my head. I pulled out my phone, ready to call Davis and throw a fit, when the hum of a luxury engine drew my attention. A sleek Bentley Mulsanne cruised to a stop in front of me.
I paused, squinting at the car.
A Bentley Mulsanne. Rare. Discontinued. Half a million, easy. Only a handful existed in the city.
Could it…?
Sure enough, the back door opened.
Everett stepped out like a scene from a movie—tall, composed, a trace of cool air trailing behind him. His tailored suit clung to his frame with obscene perfection, the faint scent of expensive cologne wafting in the breeze.
He looked like a man untouched by the heat, the dust, or this world.
My eyes locked onto his. His expression—calm, detached—never changed. Those deep-set eyes skimmed over me like I was nothing more than part of the scenery.
I scoffed. “Tch.” Disgust rose in my throat like bile. I turned sharply and stormed toward the civil affairs building, heels clicking like gunshots on the pavement.
My cheeks, already flushed from sunburn, were now burning with rage.
To be honest, I had seen that damn Bentley earlier, but I hadn’t imagined Everett would just be lounging inside. Not even once did he think to call me. I’d been baking in the sun like an idiot for nearly an hour and a half, while he sipped chilled water in luxury.
Jerk.
If this marriage didn’t end here, I swear—not even in the afterlife would I find peace.
Everett’s POV
Inside, Scarlett didn’t hesitate for even a second.
With elegant precision, she signed her name in graceful strokes—strokes that once charmed me, now infuriated me.
“I’m done. Your turn.”
Her tone was flat, dismissive. She slid the papers toward me without a glance.
I stared at her long and hard. She refused to meet my gaze, but her silence screamed louder than any fight.
“Scarlett Taylor,” I growled, “your little push-pull act doesn’t work on me anymore, so cut the crap.”
She turned slightly, glancing at the couple waiting in line behind us, then back at me with a smile so cold it could’ve frozen hell.
“Mr. Robinson, don’t tell me you’re actually having second thoughts?” Her voice was like crushed velvet—smooth, but slicing straight through.
That casual arch of her brow… the glint in her eye...
God, it hit harder than a slap.
My jaw clenched. “Scarlett, this is your last chance—”
“No need,” she cut in sharply, raising one perfectly manicured finger behind her. “Hurry up and sign. People are waiting.”
“Are you done or not?” the woman behind us snapped. “Some of us actually have jobs to get back to!”
“You heard her,” Scarlett said smoothly, “Let’s not waste everyone’s style, Mr. Robinson.”
My teeth ground so hard I thought they’d shatter.
“You’ll regret this,” I seethed. “I’ll be there the day you come crawling back.”
She gave a short, humorless laugh. “Then you better find a comfortable chair. It’ll be a long wait.”
Scarlett’s POV
Hearing his threats only made me colder. I laughed—dry and cutting.
“I won’t look back. Not in this life. Not in the next.”
“You’ve got guts, Scarlett,” Everett snarled, snatching the pen and scribbling his name with a sharp, furious motion.
I stared at the two names side by side.
His.
Mine.
Once united. Now… just ink.
A flicker of emotion crossed my heart.
But just a flicker. And then it was gone.
Letting go—it wasn’t that hard, after all.
A marriage certificate turned into a divorce slip.
From this moment on, he goes his way. I go mine.

I don't usually like vanilla because a lot of what I've smelled is really gourmand and too sweet/something I've already smelled before. And although being goth doesn't mean I can't like sweeter/gourmand fragrance it's never been my thing and never felt like me. After trying out Montale's Intense Cafe (although the rose is more prominent that the coffee and vanilla) it was so strong and beautiful I couldn't believe I liked it. And trying to curate my future collection I actually want a goth, addictive vanilla.. So what are some alluring and potent dark vanillas that I should try, I'm open to anything, smokey vanillas, dirtier vanillas, warm vanillas, cold vanillas, gourmandish too. I'm thinking of a non gourmand, very powdery, incense-y, unique, maybe smoky vanilla that isn't TOO green that is super strong and lasts forever, that's what I'm thinking I want, but whatever is good. Maybe something that also has tonka/coffee/tuberose and rose as well but as long as the vanilla is stronger.. or the main note. Or the only. Or incense-y. I can't decide. But like I said I'm open to whatever as long since I'm trying to experiment, as it lasts forever, and has incredible sillage because I want it to last for eternity and project to like, space or something.. I hate paying so much for fragrance samples just for them to not last. My budget goes to 120 but I could buy decants eventually and I'm broke and won't be buying any fragrances at the moment lol (nor in the foreseeable future) due to financial situations so suggest whatever you guys want, thanks in advance! <3 (And yes I posted this on another sub but I want more opinions lol)

He is being living somewhere else since 4 days as I already decided to rehome him and looking for the new owner , yesterday - I went and take him outside for a walk , but there was all hairs on my trousers because he likes to sit on my motorbike.

I cannot go and buy water inside the grocery store because he was there with me , I cannot go anywhere to buy anything because of him  , somehow I managed to buy water and guess what the moment he looked to the another dog - He starts chasing others means nothing changed in last 4 days when I was away.

Another incident yesterday while on walk - there was corgi with their owner without leash and this golden retriever wanted to play with that other dog corgi - but guess - the corgi unpredictably tries to attack and tries to  bite this golden retriever, I was like what the fuck - why I am even here.





Yesterday , When I come back to my room after taking him outside in the evening - I noticed there was so many hairs on my pants , oh my god my past 4 days without him was really just happy for me , I really felt happy and more free , I can rent a place whereever I want to stay, I can go to any coffee shop without having any death stare because of this golden retriever or someone coming with extra smile and saying how cute is this baby.


I have been struggling since 7 days to rehome this 1 year old golden retriever of false suggestions by some random pet lovers , oh no don't do that , he is very cute , he understands you bla bla but how much he understands you and no matters how much smart breed it is - because the dog Brain is developed equivalent to 2.5 years old baby, why would I like to hang around with a creature whos iq is so low and has to lots of hair cleaning having work to and hairs in everything ( my food + working clothes + floor ) everywhere hairs, needs my attention all the time, it's too much distraction.


And plus of that everything - I am living outside of my own country means in an foreign land ,I believe it will be too much work and for some days it's fine to play , but no oh my god ,not for years , I am only 31 unmarried - trying to build my career - it will surely degrade my performance my life and also will make me run from the problems in my real life.



I left my country 3 years before , left my parents and all family members and working hard in another country to learn oneness in self and I left humans then I why would I like to get attached to any pet - no matter how adorable cute smart elegant and everything he is, I really don't want to care because I have right to be free, it's been 1 year I have been handling all these things.




I don't the new owner will pet him good , get him outside or not , is he fine over there or not ,  neither I want to know because it doesn't matter because I have my own life and I have my rights too.

Coffee spills, muddy paws track through the hallway, and kids' art projects sometimes go rogue. For generations, the pristine rug was the biggest victim of these everyday mishaps. But what if you could just toss your rug in the washing machine?

Enter the game-changer of home decor: the **polyester washable rug**.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=polyester%20washable%20rugs)

If you're searching for a flooring solution that blends style, practicality, and genuine peace of mind, you're in the right place. Let's dive deep into everything you need to know about these modern marvels.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=polyester%20washable%20rugs)

## What Exactly Are Polyester Washable Rugs?

At first glance, they look like any other stylish area rug. But the magic lies in the material and construction.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=polyester%20washable%20rugs)

*   **Material:** These rugs are made from **polyester**, a synthetic fiber known for being incredibly durable, soft to the touch, and inherently **stain-resistant**. Unlike natural fibers, polyester doesn't absorb liquids as quickly, giving you a crucial window to clean up spills before they set.
*   **Construction:** To be ""washable,"" these rugs are designed with a specific **low-pile** or flatweave construction. This makes them flexible and lightweight enough to fit into a standard home washing machine. They often feature a flexible, non-slip backing that can withstand a wash cycle without breaking down.

In short, they are area rugs intentionally engineered for modern, messy life.

## The Unbeatable Benefits: Why You'll Love Them

Choosing a rug is a big decision. Here’s why polyester washable rugs are winning over homeowners everywhere.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=polyester%20washable%20rugs)

*   **Effortless Cleaning:** This is the crown jewel. A red wine spill or a pet accident isn't a catastrophe anymore. Just toss the rug in the washer on a gentle cycle, and it comes out looking brand new. No expensive professional cleaning, no frantic scrubbing.
*   **Superior Durability:** Polyester is a tough cookie. It can withstand high-traffic areas like living rooms, hallways, and kitchens without showing wear and tear as quickly as other materials. Its resilient fibers bounce back, resisting matting and crushing.
*   **Vibrant, Fade-Resistant Colors:** The dyeing process for polyester allows for a stunning range of rich, vibrant colors that are much more resistant to fading than many natural fibers. Your rug will stay bright and beautiful for years.
*   **Budget-Friendly Style:** Let's be real—high-end rugs can cost a fortune. **Polyester washable rugs** offer incredible style, from boho chic to modern minimalism, at a fraction of the cost of wool or silk. You can even swap them out seasonally without breaking the bank.
*   **The Ultimate Pet & Kid-Friendly Choice:** This is a no-brainer for families. Shed fur? Easily vacuumed or washed. Accidents? Machine washable. Tough play? Durable. They provide a soft, safe surface for little ones and four-legged friends, without the constant worry.

## Are There Any Downsides? The Honest Truth

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=polyester%20washable%20rugs)

No product is perfect. Here's the transparent scoop on what to consider.

*   **Texture:** While very soft, polyester rugs typically have a **low-pile** feel. If you're looking for the deep, luxurious plushness of a high-pile wool shag rug, this might not be it. However, for most, the softness is more than adequate.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Polyester is a type of plastic (PET). While its longevity and washability can reduce the need for replacements, its production is a synthetic process. Look for rugs made from **recycled polyester** for a more eco-conscious choice.
*   **Shedding:** You might experience some minimal shedding when the rug is brand new, but this is typically short-lived and far less pronounced than what you'd see from a new wool rug. A few vacuums will usually take care of it.

## How to Choose the Perfect Polyester Washable Rug for Your Home

Ready to shop? Keep this checklist handy.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=polyester%20washable%20rugs)

1.  **Measure Your Space:** The #1 rule! A rug that's too small can make a room feel disjointed.
2.  **Check the Washing Instructions:** Not all are created equal. Most are machine-washable, but some may have specific temperature or cycle requirements. Always check the label!
3.  **Consider the Backing:** Many have an integrated non-slip backing. If yours doesn't, you'll absolutely need to buy a separate rug pad to prevent slips and add extra cushioning.
4.  **Match Your Lifestyle:** For a busy entryway, a darker pattern or a flatweave is a smart choice. For a bedroom, you might opt for a softer, lighter solid color.
5.  **Find Your Style:** With endless patterns, textures, and colors, you can find a **polyester washable rug** that perfectly complements your decor, whether it's modern, traditional, or eclectic.

## Care and Maintenance: Keeping Your Rug Fresh

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=polyester%20washable%20rugs)

A little care goes a long way.

*   **Regular Vacuuming:** Vacuum once or twice a week to remove dirt, dust, and pet dander. Use a standard beater bar or suction head.
*   **Treat Spills Immediately:** Blot (don't rub!) the spill with a clean cloth to absorb as much liquid as possible.
*   **The Big Wash:** When it's time for a deep clean, follow these steps:
    *   Shake the rug outside first.
    *   Wash it **alone** in cold water on a gentle cycle with a mild detergent.
    *   **Tumble dry on low heat or, even better, air dry.** Air drying is the safest option to prevent any shrinkage or damage to the backing.

## The Verdict: A Worthy Investment for a Worry-Free Home

**Polyester washable rugs** are more than just a trend; they're a practical, stylish solution for the way we live today. They offer the perfect trifecta of durability, affordability, and effortless maintenance.

1oorurq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1oorurq/a_question_for_the_coffee_people_of_calgary/,A question for the coffee people of Calgary,"Hi!

I’m pretty new to coffee and I’ve been trying out a variety of beans at home using the Cafelat Robot. Most of them have been good, but the ones from ‘Sought X Found’ have been consistently amazing and fruity (Pink Bourbon, Yellow Bourbon etc.). I didn’t get the same intensity of flavor and aroma in others, even ones with similar fruity notes like Onyx Tropical Weather and DAK Jazz Fruits.

So my question is, do you guys (who have more experience with coffee) think that the beans from SxF are exceptionally good, or might I be looking for the wrong kind of beans.

I know this is not the clearest question, but I’d appreciate any thoughts you think might be relevant. Thanks!",3,1762312050.0,Calgary,2,0.8,False
1oorulx,https://www.reddit.com/r/strange/comments/1oorulx/someone_moved_and_loaded_my_dads_guns_while_we/,Someone moved and loaded my dad's guns while we were camping (Australia),"So far the strangest thing which has happened to me. And probably the scariest



A couple years ago, my dad (then 43M), my half-brother (then 7M) and myself (then 16F) went on a hunting/camping trip together. I'm currently 18.

We took my dad's hilux and drove up into the highlands in Victoria (I live in Australia) for a long weekend so my dad could go hunting. My sister was at our mum's house, my step-brother with his mum's house (my stepmother, my half-brother's mum), so it was just my dad, my half-brother and I. (let's call him Tim)

We took a 2-person tent, a swag, an Eski and some food. We also brought 2 of my dad's hunting rifles. My dad has worked in the ADF for 20+ years now, and also does a lot of hunting/shooting with his friends. Obviously, this isn't America, and few people even own guns, so we kept them hidden in the backseat of the car so we wouldn't scare anyone. People get really freaked out around them, which is fair if you haven't grown up with hunting fans. The important thing here is that no one on the drive over or in the suburb we went to knew my dad had guns with us.

We spent the first day hanging out around the woods. My dad was teaching my brother and I to shoot, and we used an old coffee cup to practice our aim. He made sure there was no one around and that we were alone before doing it. it was actually a lot of fun. Tim and I made tree forts and then the three of us had dinner and went to bed.

My dad slept in the swag and Tim and I in the tent. My dad locked the guns in the car, but didn't hide them. We were completely alone in the camping spot (mostly because no one was allowed to be camping or hunting there) so he didn't have any reason to hide them, since no one would see.

He locked the car and put the keys in his swag. I know because it was me who did it, because he was trying to get Tim in his pj's and asked me to make sure the car was locked, then just throw the keys into the swag. They landed near his pillow.

We all went to sleep after that, and I didn't wake up during the night. I'm a pretty light sleeper, and so is Tim, but neither of us needed to pee or were thirsty, which was a first.

But i did have a strange dream. It was of me camping in a tent in the artic. i heard a group of men talking and tents unzipping. they were speaking about shooting penguins. I don't think this is that important though, since I had just read a book about Ernest Shackleton though, which I think explains it.

The creepy part was the morning.

Tim woke up first (little kids, yk) and had to crawl over me to get out. this woke me up, so I got angry and told him off. I was loud enough to wake our dad, who I heard get up and unzip the swag. Then he started swearing.

My dad never swears around us. My brothers copy literally everything they hear, so none of our parents will say anything remotely close to anything. To this day, this is the only time i've ever heard him swear. Naturally, after hearing him cussing out the camp sight, tim and I went out.

The entire camp sight was in ruins. The fireplace we'd made was destroyed, coals and ash spread everywhere. The esky we'd brought was empty, but all the food was intact and just spread over the campsite, like the cooler had been overturned.

Most concerningly, the car was open. All the doors except the one to the boot/tray were wide open, and all the lights were turned on. And the guns had been thrown onto the ground.

Dad got angry, thinking I hadn't locked the car properly. But I *know* I locked that car. It's been a fear of mine since I can remember of being carjacked, so I always press the lock button upwards of seven times. Everyone knows I do it as well. I think dad was just trying to find an explanation.

As well as this, the lights in the car shouldn't have been on. all my siblings and I know not to turn them on because we inevitably end up leaving them on and draining the battery. They're always switched to the ""off"" setting, so they don't even turn on if the doors open.

I was freaked out, of course, because the guns had been handled, and they were loaded. I used all the bullets in them the day before when dad was teaching me to aim. He never re-loads and then leaves his guns lying around, especially if Tim is with him. But i've never asked him outright if he did - there's every chance it was him.

We don't have bears or any big mammals in Victoria that could have opened the car doors. Koalas could have been responsible for the eski, but i don't understand why they didn't touch any of the food. The bread wasn't even squashed or anything.

more over, that esky was huge. It was pretty similar to this one: [https://www.bunnings.com.au/igloo-66l-white-imx-cooler\_p0854096?store=6400](https://www.bunnings.com.au/igloo-66l-white-imx-cooler_p0854096?store=6400) but had more tabs on it to open. I don't know if there is anyway an animal could have opened it. *I* can barely open it and i have thumbs and go to the gym heaps.

we left the campsite that morning, not even stopping for breakfast. dad was concerned that someone had tipped the local authorities off about illegal camping/hunting so we high tailed it back to melbourne, where we live.

My stepmother and actual mum both agreed that it was probably animals that did it, and they somehow opened the door. the general consensus in my family is that i didn't lock the car properly and we were just the unlucky victims of a rogue koala.

But i can't shake the feeling that there was someone in that camp. I keep thinking about the fact that if it was someone who had messed up our stuff and moved the guns. I'm shocked that none of us woke up.

There were never any calls from police either, which i think there would have been had someone seen us illegally hunting and camping. they would have been able to take down the licence.

I'm not sure if there is any actual merit to this encounter - if it was one at all. but I am still freaked out about it.",5,1762312038.0,strange,5,1.0,False

1oorrkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/OT42/comments/1oorrkb/relatable_reese_says_her_son_talks_to_tommy_three/,Relatable Reese says her son talks to Tommy three times a day,"Reese Quibell stands up near the beginning of her stream and her shirt is so short that her stomach hangs out of it. She says when she went to the doctor today, she found out she has gained 8 pounds. ""That'll ruin your day,"" she says, adding that weighing 189 pounds should give her haters some material to work with. She complains that going off Rybelsus for five weeks really messed her up and now her doctor has her on a lower dose and she's still eating too much. She's wearing another new hat from Southern Goods Mercantile and those aren't cheap.   
  
Reese took the highest dose of Rybelsus for years and she tells a nurse in the chat she's concerned because if she moves to Ecuador, she won't be able to get that medication for her diabetes. She claims that she doesn't eat anything until 3 p.m. but then she snacks a lot at night. When a chatter asks why she's moving to Ecuador, Reese says that's where her peace is, it's her favorite place on Earth and Tommy lives there.   
  
GLP-1 drugs can cause pancreatitis and Reese is at higher risk of getting it because she had it this summer, she says. A chatter suggests Reese could fly back to the United States every six months and get Rybelsus and Reese says she'll be flying back about every three months. She says she's going to keep her current doctor, her health insurance and her phone plan. She says she can switch to Ozempic when she moves to Ecuador but she doesn't want to do that. Her doctor suggested she could switch to Jardiance for her diabetes, which is not a GLP-1.   
  
She claims her doctor didn't care when she told him that she has been self-prescribing herself prednisone and he gave her more. Her doctor also prescribed a muscle relaxer for her neck pain, she says. Reese claims her doctor talked to her for about 45 minutes, he was very funny and he recorded their entire conversation.  
  
Reese then starts throwing shade at Marilyn Honig for reposting the Long Con video on her channel. Reese calls it old news that nobody gives a shit about.   
  
She compliments herself and Tommy on their Cults and Crims stream from last night, calling it hilarious. Tommy interrupts her stream with a text and she says she hasn't talked to him much today because she's been out and about. She thanks everyone who became members on Cults and Crims last night.   
  
When a superchatter asks Reese how to send money to her Venmo account, Reese claims she doesn't know and says her mods will have to put up those details. A mod immediately pops up all of Reese's cash app information and Reese thanks her, saying that it really helps when people send her cash instead of superchats because YouTube doesn't take 30 percent of the cash. She starts asking her chat to come up with more ideas to rename Cults and Crims and they do. A chatter tells Reese it's like she and Tommy are becoming missionaries of a sort by moving to Ecuador.   
  
Reese claims that she plans every year what she's going to buy on Black Friday. She says she doesn't like to just blow money, which made me laugh out loud. She alleges she's not going to buy clothes, shoes, handbags or furniture this year because she's trying to downsize. She's going to buy a year's supply of Paula's Choice skin care products, she says. Reese keeps getting interrupted by texts. She says she feels scammed by Sephora because their Black Friday discounts aren't as steep as she would like.   
  
She says she has already made a lot of friends in Ecuador and she claims there are no rules there, adding that she saw a lot of babies just being held in cars instead of being strapped into car seats. ""No one cares what you do,"" she says. Reese is in for a rude awakening if that's what she really thinks.  
  
She claims her stepdad is super happy for her plan to move to Ecuador. She says she may come back to the United States and that she plans to get a two-year visa. She says there's no question that she will be allowed to make money on YouTube while she's on a nomad visa.   
  
She talks about the private prep school in Ecuador where she claims she wants to send H, but she says tonight that it costs $300 a month. Last week, she said it cost $200 a month, but there's no way to tell if she just misspoke or if she's making things up off the top of her head about that school. She claims that she has spoken to a lot of parents who send their kids there.   
  
She says she's going to sell her 2023 hybrid Honda CRV before she leaves for Ecuador ""and that will give me a nice cushion to live on."" Reese claims she can work from anywhere with her other job.   
  
She claims she's constantly worried about money because she never knows month to month how much money she will make from her YouTube channel. Reese alleges she has a really big hospital bill that she needs to pay off because she has really good credit. ""I don't want to ruin my credit,"" she says. Then she immediately claims she has money set aside for emergencies. Emergency room visits are exactly the kind of expenses people use emergency funds for, Reese.   
  
Reese claims that she looked at apartments when she was there ""and you can get a really nice apartment a block from the beach for $300 a month,"" she says. ""You can buy that exact same apartment for $50,000."" When a chatter asks how Reese would transport her pets to and from the vet, she says in Ecuador vets make house calls.   
  
She says she wants to sell the motorcycle that Tommy left at her house but then adds that he wants to figure out a way to ship it to Ecuador. He would definitely want her to sell it so she can have the money to move, she says.  
  
Reese alleges that H really loves it in Ecuador and that he's not attached to anything in Tennessee. Before Reese moved to Tennessee, she raved about how Tennessee was H's favorite place and how he was so close to his grandparents who live there. Now she claims he's not attached to anything in the United States. ""He talks to Tommy three times a day,"" she says. That is extremely alarming and is a huge red flag. That poor kid needs friends his own age and a chance at a normal life. H should not be leaning on or looking up to a con artist who spent so many years in prison.   
  
She claims H told her yesterday that he's never had a man in his life who cares about him more than Tommy, but months ago Reese told her channel how heartbroken H was by Tommy and how disappointed H was in him. She admitted while sobbing that her screaming fights with Tommy had done further emotional damage to H. ""Tommy has completely apologized to him,"" Reese claims tonight. ""I like having people in my life who are fuck-ups."" She says she cares about how people take accountability and clean up after their mistakes.   
  
Reese is encouraging others who don't feel at home where they live to consider moving to Ecuador. Her new friends there don't speak English. She claims she had a therapy session today that rocked her socks off.   
  
She found a church she loves in Ecuador, she says. She and Tommy met the American pastor and his Ecuadorian wife for breakfast one day. Her omelette cost 25 cents and came with coffee and toast, she says. She and Tommy went out for steak and the filet she got cost $10. Reese needs to quit talking about being a vegetarian when she keeps bringing up eating steak.   
  
Reese finally admits on her channel to drinking contaminated water multiple times in Ecuador and says she's not sure if that made her sick or not.

When a chatter asks if Reese is going to start taking Spanish lessons, she says she doesn't know and that she might just pick the new language up on her own.   
  
Reese holds up beaded bracelets that a woman in Ecuador named Mona made for her. She says they're like bracelets she used to order from Hart that are ridiculously expensive at $85 each. When she first went to Mona's booth, Mona told her each bracelet cost $2 and she offered to make Reese custom bracelets for $7 to $10.   
  
She made a bag full of stuff for Reese and Reese says Mona insisted on Reese picking out a gift even though Mona is extremely poor. Tommy told Reese he was going to give Mona a lot more money than she was asking for anyway, Reese claims, adding that Tommy gave Reese two $20 bills and told her to give that to Mona on top of what Reese paid her. I think Reese is trying to rehabilitate Tommy's reputation because she complained for months about how Tommy made her pay for everything during their time together and how he couldn't afford much of anything.   
  
Reese claims she overtipped everyone in Ecuador and says no one wants to take advantage of others there even though they're so broke. ""That changed me,"" Reese says, adding that's what really sold her on Ecuador. She actually says that there is no crime there. Wow, she is delusional.   
  
Reese leaves to go get the jewelry that Mona made for her and then she starts showing pictures that Tommy took of her and Mona. She shows some of the bracelets Mona made for her and says she'd love to set up a store so that Relatable Reese fans could buy items from her. ""It would change her whole life,"" she says.   
  
Reese says her biggest hope is that God is going to use her to do something really good there. She says she would love to start a shelter and help animals. She brags about Tommy going to a rehab center once a week and he and Johnny making 40 sandwiches for patients there.

She shows pictures of herself and Tommy in Ecuador and claims she really likes the idea of not having a car there. She says people can change and she's grateful for the Long Con video she did because it caused her to grow and change.

I recently moved to Dhaka for work and I’m still getting to know the city — would love to meet some new people here!

A bit about me:
I’m Sunil, originally from Hyderabad, India, currently working as the COO of The Mahal Fashions (Sydney & Dhaka) and managing a few international retail projects. My background is in luxury brand management and business consulting, so I love conversations around design, travel, culture, and entrepreneurship.

Outside of work, I’m quite social and easygoing — enjoy exploring cafés, weekend getaways, and meeting people from creative, business, or academic backgrounds.

I’m hoping to connect with educated, positive, and like-minded people in Dhaka — both men and women — who enjoy good conversation, food, and new experiences.
If there’s anyone open to meeting up for coffee, dinner, or just hanging out socially, feel free to reach out.

Looking forward to building a small circle of interesting friends (and maybe even finding someone special 😄).

1oorqei,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1oorqei/laundry_power_trip/,Laundry power trip.,"I had to move back in with my mom a few months ago due to the cost of living. We’ve had a very tumultuous relationship my whole life but she promised me she would leave me alone this time. I’ve been through an abusive relationship that included financial abuse and my mom had been pushing for me to come live with her for years. I finally gave in when I truly couldn’t afford to live on my own anymore. 

There’s been quite a few arguments lately and I feel like I’m going crazy. Yesterday, I woke up at 4pm (night shift worker) and the moment I got up my mom started talking about all the things she had to do, including laundry. She used the machines all weekend and stopped me from continuing my laundry on Saturday saying she “gets the next turn”. So I said I needed to do laundry because I have no clean scrubs to wear to work the next two nights and they need to hang to dry. She went for a nap and texted me “you better do your laundry ASAP or I’ll be doing it during the day tomorrow when you’re sleeping”(my room is in the basement where the laundry machines are). To me this was a clear power trip and threat to inconvenience me if I dont do what she wants. She works from home and stays in her pajamas all day. I replied “ I just got up, can I eat? You had the machines all weekend, let me live. I’ll be at work for the next 2 nights so you can do all the laundry you want then.”. 

When she woke up and saw the texts she said “what’s this?!” All outraged. I said I was responding to what she said and she continued arguing with me. It turned into a big screaming argument. She’s extremely controlling and takes everything that isn’t “yes maam” as a direct attack. I called her out on the power trip about the laundry and she denied it. She doesn’t think she’s in the wrong. 

I made the mistake of allowing her to drop me off for work and on the way I asked her if she was going to acknowledge what happened. She said that it happened and it’s over and it doesn’t need to be discussed. I really wanted an apology from her and for her to admit she was wrong and since she doesn’t think she’s wrong, it ended up in another argument. I accept my part of the blame for allowing myself to be baited into this argument and for letting things escalate. I just get so triggered when she won’t listen to me and keeps repeating the same thing over and over. She said “I could have gone down and done my laundry anyway but I didn’t.” To me this highlighted the deeply ingrained expectation from her that I need to be “grateful” and “show appreciation” for everything she does, even allowing me to use her laundry machines. She acts like she’s doing me a favour. So I called her on it and said I won’t be on my hands and knees thanking her for allowing me to do basic life needs. I left the car by saying she primed me to be a perfect abusive victim and that’s what ended up happening with different people in my life. 

Me standing up for myself and raising my voice have been newer reactions since coming out of my abusive relationship. I’ve truly had enough and feel like I’m going to explode whenever my mom triggers me. 

TLDR; mom had the laundry machines all weekend and works from home. Yesterday I needed to wash my scrubs bc I was working the next two nights and had none. She then demanded that I do my laundry immediately when I had just woken up or she would be waking me up to do laundry today while I was sleeping (I’m a nightshift worker and the laundry is in the basement where my room is). I called her out and refused to drop everything before I had even had coffee or eaten and she was outraged that I didn’t meet her demands, ended in a huge fight. The fight continued on today when I accepted a ride from her and she refused to admit she was wrong. 

I guess I just wanted to vent to people who understand. Am I in the wrong here? How do you stop yourself from reacting when they push you?

My boyfriend (let’s call him A) and I started dating at the end of March, so we’ve been together for about 8 months. We share similar traits, we’re both introverted and tend to be passive communicators. We usually don’t text first unless someone reaches out, and we don’t go out unless friends invite us.

A plays mainly offline AAA games and doesn’t use social media. I enjoy online mobile games, participating in game communities, creating content, making memes, and designing characters.
I’m online a lot because I also run my business there.

Sometimes I want to share things I create or find online with him, but he doesn’t really get it because he isn’t into fandom culture or social media. He doesn’t share much about what he plays either, he plays a lot of different games, and the one title we both liked, he doesn’t play anymore. When I bring it up, I feel like he’s not interested in talking about it.

When we first started dating, we talked often and even went out together for coffee or walks in the park. But now, we can go weeks without texting (we don’t live together). I try to start conversations, but they often feel dry and fizzle out, and then we fall into another quiet stretch.

I want to work on this relationship. I care about him, but I’m starting to feel lonely, especially when I see friends with partners they can talk to and connect with easily.

1oorozs,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1oorozs/advice_to_help_me_continue_in_my_journey/,Advice to help me continue in my journey……,"43 year old male here, on March 7, 2025 I weighed 230, woke up that day and decided I was going to stop drinking alcohol and start eating healthy because I was unhappy with myself, and I did.  It’s now November 4, 2025 and I’m down to 171.8 and feel like I’ve plateaued doing what I’ve been doing.  

Basically I stopped drinking alcohol, I pretty much only drink (a lot of) ice water and a black iced coffee every morning before work, sometimes the coffee has sugar free vanilla in it, but not always.  Sometimes I drink various flavors of Liquid Death waters as well, but not a lot.  

I stopped eating all breads and pastas, zero dairy except for Greek nonfat yogurt every morning with blueberries added in, cut out all red meat, no processed meats either and have tried to eliminate as much sodium and sugar as humanly possible.  I’ve basically been living off salads, air fried turkey and chicken, fruits and vegetables, some Made Good organic granola bars. I don’t do cheat meals, but if I’m cooking my kids a pizza or something I’ll have just a bite.  I’m pretty good about not going against whatever I choose to do, I don’t have cheat meals.  

Also, I haven’t exercised one time since I started this.  All my changes have been solely what I put into my body.  I have an active job though, I’m on my feet all day constantly moving and lifting things.  

With that being said, I am pretty happy with where I’m at with my weight loss, it really hasn’t been too hard at all, I’ve just had to stick to the choices I’ve decided to make and thankfully it’s been working.  I don’t really feel like I want to lose much more weight.  10 pounds maybe, idk, I really didn’t have any goals when I started this I just wanted to see what happens.  What I’m most interested in is just kind of tightening up what I’ve done so far, and I don’t really know where to take my journey from here.  I guess the obvious thing to do is to start exercising, but I am suuuuuuper lazy and really don’t want to do that.  😂

I take daily blood pressure and cholesterol medication, and have for a few years now.  I don’t take any multivitamins, but I have been considering adding that, but I don’t know how that would affect my weight management.   I’m assuming I’ve cut out a lot of nutrients by choosing to eliminate so many things from my diet, so how would adding a multivitamin to my daily regimen affect my weight?  

I’m an idiot when it all comes to this, but I’m trying, and I have people stop me at work every day talking to me about my weight loss, so I know it’s working, and it feels really good.  I’m just at the point now where I’d like to do more, and short of starting to exercise I don’t know what else to do.  😂  I reallllly don’t want to start exercising, if you couldn’t tell.  

Also, I’d just like to mention something that never even popped into my head before starting all of this.   I’ve done this all on my own, (with a lot of help from the very useful Yuka app) and it’s been pretty disheartening that I’ve had a few people ask me what kind of weight loss shot I’ve been taking.  It sucks a bit knowing there’s people out there who will just assume that.  

Thanks for any comments in advance.

Went from 230-171, feel like I’ve plateaued, would like advice on breaking through this wall.

[Fifteen Chefs Remain...](https://preview.redd.it/jnvzaj01sczf1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=f731f08b5e7c0fab1e70f4d2f2cba443caf413eb)

***And now, the continuation of Hell’s Kitchen…***

Ramsay dismissed the teams, as they’d make their way out of the dining room, with Allison saying in her confessional that being up on that slate is her sign that she’s going to kick even more ass and try to get through to her teammates that she can do brilliant in a professional working environment, and she’ll be head chef sooner than they realize it. The Red Team would return to the dorms, feeling the weight of Wanda’s elimination. Though Ruben says in his confessional that it was for her own good anyways, before scratching that, and clarifying it was for the good of the Red Team, so it’s not like it’s a huge loss… He’d boldly mention that with the weakest link gone, they can finally start winning, but Henri does remind him that with attitude, he might need to tone it down, because cockiness does get somewhere not excellent. Though Ruben does tell the ‘old man’ that he may seem to know a lot of shit, but he saw what he was doing; fucking up the french fries they had on supply, and he tells him that anything else like that, and they’d get infected with spuds. This earns a few confused stares from the other Red Team members, with Kara asking Ruben what that’s supposed to mean. Ruben wouldn’t answer that question straight away, but would assume himself as the one in charge of the Red Team for next time they do another service. In her confessional, Isabela says that Ruben may have a lot of optimism and prowess in what he can do, but at the same time, she knows he’s a stubborn hothead who seems a bit paper-skinned. The Red Team would talk about what they can do to improve for the next service, but Isabela would make a strict point that first things need to come first; communicate. Kara agrees to this, as she states in her confessional that being a leader comes with a lot of perks and power; she hopes to become someone strong and competent like Leslie from *Parks and Recreation*, even giving Amy Poehler a shoutout. Kara also talks to Henri, seeing how he’s a fellow Canadian contestant on the show. Henri says yes, he was born and raised in Quebec, but he’s become a dual citizen for both Canada and the United States, but he mostly rotates between Montreal and Plattsburgh to mentor new chefs whenever he’s not working on cruise ships. The two continue talking amongst themselves what it feels like to become Chef Ramsay’s next protege, the prospect too hot to give up. 

Meanwhile, the Blue Team were relieved to have finished another dinner service, with JC optimistically stating in his confessional that there’s about fifteen chefs left, and chances are, he’s got a one in fifteen chance of making it; all he needs to do is work by example, show dedication, and viola; it’s like he never left home at all. Though David would state in his confessional that he’s happy they won service tonight, he does note a couple of liabilities; especially mentioning JC, because he was dragging on a few Appetizers, but mostly the Entrees. David would borrow JC for a moment, and when they’d talk out on the patio, David would tell JC that he’s happy they finished service, but he also expresses concern for him; noting his Meat station mistakes. JC nodded and apologized, stating that he didn’t think cooking meatballs or burgers was difficult, and he had his own burgers in contention for winning the Punishment Pass Challenge. David does advise him that it’s fine, but he just wants him to focus on the next service, because chances are, his stock could be low as of now, and he’s had to make risky gambles to get back on. JC would ask David if he’s lost some money playing poker… David would think about it for a second, before letting out a heavy sigh, stating that there were moments in his life when he dealt with poker that he lost big money… And as he’d tell JC his story, David would mention in his confessional that nearly two years ago, he had lost a lot of his savings due to him making a major risk that proved fatal. Though he managed to scrape some money back, it’s still not enough in his eyes, as it really shook him hard with how much he had to surrender. That’s why he wants to work hard like the way he’s doing, and get better with how he manages not just his finances, but also himself. 

Meanwhile, the two teams were mingling with each other, with Samuel and Rio getting praises from people like Kara, Edward, Dani, and Shayna of how great they were performing out there. Samuel couldn’t stop blushing, and he’d state in his confessional that he’s here to become Ramsay’s next protege, not to be a celebrity; though he does contradict himself that winning Hell’s Kitchen does count for being a celebrity. Rio, however, does express optimism on being able to prove himself, stating that he knows he might not have a chance, but at the same time, he doesn’t want to give up. Kara sat next to him, and they’d bond with each other on getting to find that chance, with them telling each other fun life stories, or their biggest achievements in their respective lives. Kara was astonished to hear Rio’s been featured in a magazine with Dean Fearing, the ‘father of southwestern cuisine’, but she, as well as the others, don’t understand why he hasn’t been mentioned past that. Though Rio does state that he’s been having a lot of trouble finding a higher paying job, and that’s another reason why he’s had to take two jobs at once. Edward makes a confessional of how he can’t imagine how it feels to be in Rio’s shoes, but at the same time, there is the pressure of maintaining something, and he scratches the back of his head before he could finish his sentence. Shayna would also come over to Rio and tell him she knows it can be a bit tough finding a better job than the two he has, but she assures him that as long as he gets on the right footing, he’ll be bound for success. Rio smiles at this, and tells his fellow comrades that he’ll look into starting tomorrow. Over in the dorm kitchen, Henri was talking with Tem, Isabela, Allison, and Freddie when they noticed Rio’s confident boast; he’d state the ‘kid’ must have reached a breakthrough, but Allison does make a joke that it’s either that, or he’s still excited that he was Barney the Dinosaur for a night. Isabela does smile at this, and she expresses confidence in her confessional that she knows things will go right tomorrow, and she’ll stop at nothing to ensure that happens. Eventually, everyone would go to bed for the night…

**Challenge**

The next morning, both teams would scamper out of bed to get dressed, as there is yet another challenge waiting for them. However, JC would immediately make note of a certain smell that’s coming to mind, and he would mention in his confessional that he knows it all too well… As soon as they make it down to the kitchen, they would find Ramsay standing behind a white-clothed table, with a few domes over plates. He would greet everyone upon their arrival, telling them that he’s got quite a treat for them to give them, and by that, he means something delicious for everyone to witness… Ramsay presented these special dishes, uncovering every dome; ropa vieja, rabo encendido, and picadillo. The British chef invited them all to try them, suggesting it’d be a ‘delicious breakfast’. Everyone took their turns tasting them, and upon them all finishing, Ramsay asked them what each dish has in common, to which JC immediately raises his hand. However, rather than giving him the go-ahead to answer, Ramsay explains he wants to give everyone an idea of what they’ll be in for today’s challenge, because it has a lot to do with Miami’s heritage… He would first have Marino dim the lights in the dining room a bit, with the maitre d’hotel doing so, creating a suspenseful atmosphere, with Shayna wondering if someone’s going to appear out of nowhere; if it does, she’ll faint. Ramsay would have everyone direct their attention to a panel, which had its lights turned off. He would take out his phone and activate something; first, Alberto Rivera’s *Eternity*, trying to create a musical, suspenseful feel. Later, he’d press something that activated the panel, making it illuminate colorful water that was raining down from the top of the panel to the bottom; at first, a cerulean blue light, and, thanks to added effects, Ramsay would add tropical ambience noises, complete with ocean wave sounds, soft wind, bird tweets, among others… Everyone was in awe as they watched the water lights hypnotizing them; nobody dared to speak up, as they didn’t want to ruin the moment. The water lights in the center would slowly change color to a royal blue, creating a shape of a certain country… Tem turned her head to find JC next to her already bursting into tears… JC tearfully addressed this in his confessional, stating that because Cuba is where his family originated from, he’s happy that they’re doing a challenge completely based on his roots. Ramsay kept the miniature light show on for a bit longer, before he turned to Marino, signalling to turn the lights back on. 

With Ramsay turning the music off, but leaving the water light panel on, he tells them that Cuba has a variety of delicious culinary masterpieces; each of them come from a different area… He gestures to the panel, and tells them that for today’s challenge, the chefs will break up into two pairs and work on making a dish that represents any of the following regions of Cuba… On the panel, a portion of the royal blue water turns to a sky blue; one much lighter than cerulean. Ramsay says the lighter shade of blue represents the seaside; La Costa. And when he thinks of La Costa, he thinks of seafood dishes with a delicious hint of citrus; something that gives the dish a brighter color. In her confessional, Allison states she’s aware of a lot of these different culinary atmospheres; making a Cuban dish could be a way to strengthen her international palette. Back on the panel, another portion of royal blue turns to a brickish red, with Ramsay telling them this next region represents Las Montañas, the mountains; which is a mainly earthy, rustic environment; smoked meats with roasted vegetables as a side dish. A third portion of royal blue turns to light green, and Ramsay tells the chefs that portion is supposed to be El Campo, which represents a homestyled level of cooking; slightly less rustic, but does have a nature that people call home. JC would state in his confessional that he’d be a master of working on El Campo if he were chosen to do it. Finally, there are small portions of gray, which Ramsay calls La Habana Urbana, which he describes as being bold, palettes elevated to be artistic, colorful, creative… And how each chef will be chosen to do which subject will depend on the color of raffle rods the sous chefs will hand out. Ramsay would state there are four rods for each subject (La Costa, El Campo, and Las Montañas; sky blue, green, and red, respectively), except for La Habana Urbana’s gray, where there are three; meaning one person from the Red Team will work solo, while the rest will work together. As everyone draws from the buckets each sous chef handed out, they’d find out what they’re gonna cook with. Ruben makes a confessional of how he’s got La Costa, and is gonna have to find something creative that’ll make Ramsay shit himself with excitement. The others continue to draw rods until there are none left, and when everyone finds out who they’re gonna work with, they are told by Ramsay to pair up with them immediately, depending on what color they had. He reminds them one last time that any region of Cuba they’ll work on depends on the color of rod they have onhand, and he tells them to get started… now!

**La Costa - Shayna & Ruben vs. Tem & David**

**Las Montañas - Henri & Allison vs. Edward & Dani**

**El Campo - Isabela & Kara vs. Freddie & JC**

**La Habana Urbana - Rio vs. Sierra & Samuel**

\-----

With the luz verde activated, all the chefs ran straight to their respective kitchens, determination in their veins as they worked to make a culinary festivity for Ramsay to taste. JC would be amped up in his confessional, as he knows so much about the countryside. He and Freddie debated on what kind of dish they’d make, and what would go well El Campo-style. Being the expert of Cuban culinary arts, JC takes the helm of what they could do, suggesting to Freddie making a sausage dish that isn’t too spicy, to which Freddie makes a lighthearted joke about how he doesn’t want Ramsay’s mouth to burn another time. Freddie activated the stove to start the sausage dish they’ll be working with, as they begin thinking of what kinds of spices they could use for their sauce. Meanwhile, Samuel worked with Sierra on their La Habana Urbana-style dish, both wondering what goes well in a metro Cuban environment. In his confessional, Samuel says he’s no expert on Cuba, but he’s sure that whatever dish they make will be one to wow Ramsay. Both of them debate on making a steak kind of dish. Shaking on that idea, Samuel starts prepping the steak, while Sierra debates what kinds of sauces they could use, only to contradict herself, deciding that perhaps they could make a festive kind of environment with contrasting sauces on the same plate together. The only thing is they need to see what kinds of sauces they need to put on, as there could be plenty of options, but Sierra suggests to Samuel they don’t want to overdo it. With Edward and Dani, they seem to be in sync with what to make for their Las Montañas dish, debating what Cubans like to make up in the mountaintop regions. Edward says in his confessional that the mountains of Cuba are more inland than out, and that means there are more chances of them making meat… He suggests to Dani they make something using pork, because he’s more than aware that island nations have lots of pigs. Dani quips back that she hopes he isn’t talking about the ‘Bay of Pigs’, otherwise, they’d have to ‘invade it’. Edward awkwardly nodded at that, making Dani ask if that was too soon. Nevertheless, Dani began making their pork dish, while Edward had to wonder what kind of marinade would go well in it, with his partner suggesting they try to make it a bit sweet, in addition to the rustic tang they have to go for. They’d debate kinds of starchy vegetables to add to the sauce, just to give it an earthy taste, before eventually deciding on yucca. Tem and David were seen working on the La Costa dish, before they ultimately went for lobster. In his confessional, David expresses his confidence that he and Tem will get their dish up to par with the tropics of Cuba. Both he and Tem debated on the kind of twist they’ll work to make, before coming up with a garlic and lime butter, as well as adding a little salsa that can go well with it. They think of different fruits to pair it with, before going with mango, because fruits like them can balance the overall dish with their sweetness, and Tem says in her confessional that she’s never been a huge mango eater, but she’s confident that it’s definitely good to be used for anything, especially on savory foods. 

Over with the Red Team, they were working hard to give Ramsay the keys to a culinary masterpiece that would make all of Cuba proud. Over with Allison and Henri, they were working on a dish that screamed mountaintops. In her confessional, Allison says working with Henri is a bit on the nose, stating she knows a lot of ideas on what to cook, but if she can really teach an old dog new tricks, it’s gonna be something he’ll have to learn with her. She would be seen guiding Henri on how to cook their beefy dish, to which Henri responds he’s got no issue with it, thanking her. In his own confessional, Henri says Allison is a lovely young lady, but he’s tackled these high seas even when she was in diapers. Allison, meanwhile, was caramelizing onions for their mixture to decorate, insistent that their dish would suffice with them. Henri understood, stating it should have a good balance of sweet and rustic, and when Allison asks if cafe (or coffee) works well for their dish, Henri says perhaps a hint of it would go, because he doesn’t want any overwhelming flavors from Ramsay. Over with Ruben and Shayna, they were busy cooking the La Costa dish, and they collectively came up with a special octopus dish. The question was what kinds of spices or seasoning would they use for it. They ultimately decide to try a barbecue sauce with a hint of mango, with Shayna mentioning in her confessional that a few days ago, they had a challenge-winning dish that made the menu with mango, and states that perhaps they should replicate it a little. Additionally, Shayna suggests to Ruben they make a coconut rum that can mesh the flavors out, that way the barbecue won’t be too overpowering. Meanwhile, Kara and Isabela were working hard on their El Campo dish, as they debated what kinds of ingredients they’d use. They want to try making a chicken dish, but Kara wondered what could be more countryside-oriented, and Isabela says they could try a corncake base for the chicken. In her confessional, she states how her grandparents had made a similar recipe to the one she and Kara are making, and she wants to try and replicate it; but less corncake. The two ladies seemed confident that they’d get this recipe out in the running for wowing Chef Ramsay, making sure to put a special Cuban jerk marinade for the chicken. Over with Rio, he was working solo on the La Habana Cubana dish, and this meant that he was working double overtime to make sure that it would be a unique one. He states in his confessional that he had only learned about Cuban dishes for only less than a year, but he wants to make a niche twist to a classic kind. When Michelle asked him what he was cooking, Rio stated he was making a pork dish, but he wanted to give it a delicious spin that the streets of Cuba will love him for. 

Each chef continued to cook their dish with their partner, time dwindling as they kept working nonstop to try and complete it before Ramsay ordered them to plate. With Tem and David, they’re working well in tandem. However, David didn’t notice his lobster cooking a little longer than usual, though he states in his confessional, it’s all about taking risks and making sure they pay off well in the end. Meanwhile, Ruben got a taste of the sauce Shayna was about to baste, and when he gave her the thumbs up, she would glaze it on top. Elsewhere, Isabela and Kara were putting the finishing touches for their chicken dish. For giggles, they borrowed Rio to take a taste of their marinade to see if they needed to take anything out. After a little taste, Rio described it as just right; stating there’s not too much habanero they used in it, but just a niche blend between hot and spicy. Isabela tasted the marinade herself, and she thought it was a bit spicier, so she suggested to Kara they try to reduce the spice with lime juice. In her confessional, Isabela states that the acidity of lime juice can make the spiciness a bit more tolerable; she just had to try something like that. Over with JC and Freddie, they tasted the sauce of their spice, and Freddie started coughing a bit, asking JC how much spice they put in their dish, and in his confessional, JC is worried that he may have put too much spice for their sausage, stressing they cannot lose like this, given how limited time they have to make a new sauce. However, Freddie has a new idea on how to reduce the spice of the sauce a bit more; oranges. After squeezing an orange, he adds it into the sauce, states in his confessional that they seemed so close, he had to get something to simmer it down. Meanwhile, Samuel and Sierra were already plating their steak dish, and Sierra stated that this is as easy as the time she won her team the soccer championship when she was nine. 

Ramsay began the countdown, signifying the final few seconds of the challenge. Everyone raced to the pass to present their dishes, but Dani nearly slipped as she carried hers and Edward’s dish, only for Edward to catch her, his hands on her arms. After Dani thanked Edward for the help, they put their dish on the pass, with Dani wiping the sweat off her brow in her confessional, muttering how that would’ve been a disaster had she slipped. With all the chefs lining their dishes up, Ramsay would congratulate all of them for putting a solid effort into crafting their foods; no matter what portion of Cuba they’re representing, he’s sure that they’ll make people proud, including himself. However, Ramsay says that he won’t be judging this alone; joining him will be a chef-entrepreneur who’s made a major name of herself in Miami; the chef and owner of three different restaurants; Eileen Andrade. The young woman enters the dining room to the applause of the other chefs, and JC says in his confessional that he’s been to *Finka Table & Tap* a few times with his family; he also mentions he’s met Eileen before, but only for a hot ten seconds. Eileen would state it’s a pleasure, and she can’t wait to see how everyone’s takes on each culinary region of Cuba comes out. In her confessional, Kara expresses confidence in presenting their dish to Eileen, given how she’s a pretty strong force in the Miami culinary community. 

First up was La Costa, with Shayna/Ruben vs. Tem/David, and as the duo brought their dishes up, Ramsay and Eileen would first focus their attention on the Red Team’s dish, asking them what they’ve concocted. Ruben would describe their cooked octopus dish, complete with a little hint of mango barbecue drizzle and citrusy coconut rum on top. The judges would ask them what made them come up with the octopus inspiration, and Ruben, always quick to the punch, would state he knows octopus is a strong delicacy, especially in places like Latin America. Shayna would also back him up, stating that she’s cooked with Caribbean flavors in the past, and says that octopus is one of the more popular foods on her occasional menu item that gets ordered. Upon taking a bite, Ramsay and Eileen would note how properly cooked it was. However, Eileen says that when they had mentioned Caribbean flavors in it, she feels that the barbecue overwhelms the other tropical flavors in the octopus, and as such, she’s not sure if it’s *truly* La Costa-feeling. Ramsay agrees, pointedly asking the two if they’d gotten this octopus in the mountains of Cuba, as he can’t seem to taste any hint of fruit in it. Shayna would shake her head in her confessional, wondering how she didn’t taste the sauce before they dressed it. Turning their attention to Tem and David on the Blue Team, Ramsay asked them what they made. The two would describe their dish; grilled lobster with a garlic-lime butter, as well as mango-salsa complete with jalapenos and picked onions. Both judges seemed intrigued with the presentation of the meal, with Eileen stating that it sounds tropical enough, and while Ramsay agrees, he wants to know if it tastes as good as it sounds… However, upon making the cross-section, Ramsay wonders what the hell he’s cutting into… because it’s a bit tough and rubbery… Tasting it, Eileen compares the lobster’s texture to tasting a rubber tire, and that’s more than enough reason for Ramsay to declare it overcooked, and it’s especially a tragedy because the salsa was a lot more appetizing to stomach. David would rub his head in his confessional, cursing that he should’ve taken it off the grill sooner. Ramsay and Eileen were left with the decision of which duo deserved a point, between overcooked lobster and octopus with conflicting flavors. Eileen would apologize, and say that neither team deserves a point, even with the amount of effort they’ve made, she can’t say either La Costa dish is appealing. Ramsay would sigh in agreement, telling both duos to piss off. In his confessional, Ruben was a bit tense with the final decision, even uttering a “*La Costa my dick,*”

Hoping to clear their palettes, Ramsay called for the duos in charge of Las Montañas to come forward. First up was Edward and Dani, and Ramsay asked what kind of dish they had made. They presented their pork dish with a mojo complete with minced garlic, onion, and a little orange juice, with a hint of yucca. Along with it was a side of seasoned black beans cooked with rice. Judging by the smell, Eileen stated that it does hold a reminder of rural Cuba, with Ramsay agreeing. Wondering if it tastes as good as it does, they cut into the pork, and after a couple of bites, Eileen explains that the dish has this smoky taste with a little tang from the orange juice they had used, and it does bring a scape that could be found in the mountains. Ramsay agreed that the pork was cooked deliciously, and with a limited amount of time, they somehow managed to recreate a slow-roasted environment for the protein, putting the smoky texture intact. Hearing this, Dani and Edward high five each other, with Dani stating in her confessional that this had  better put them on the scoreboard. Next up were Allison and Henri, who presented their oxtail dish with garlic mojo, minced caramelized onions, and a side of seasoned rice and beans. Henri also adds that they put in a small blend of cafe into the marinade, stating that he and Allison wanted to give a sort of earthy texture. Eileen states that cafe is an important element when using it to make dishes inspired by the mountains, because it’s essentially homegrown; the kind of rural hospitality that gives each dish a splendid identity. Ramsay agrees to it, stating that judging by the smell of the dish, it seems like with the touch of coffee, it added more to this beef dish, but does wonder if it tastes as good as it smells. Upon taking bites into the dish, they found that it was delicious; Ramsay stated the oxtail was cooked beautifully, and with that addition of coffee, it enhanced the dish a bit, and each texture and flavor definitely brought out a mountainous vibe. Turning to Eileen, he asked which dish was the best one. However, Eileen says it’s a tough one; between the oxtail and the pork, they’re both strong contenders. Ramsay would agree with her, stating that it should be a great surprise that both teams have been awarded a point, making the score 1-1. In her confessional, Allison slightly disagrees with the judges, feeling that her and Henri’s dish was more Las Montañas than Dani and Edward’s, but it’s fine; they at least got a point. 

Next up was the El Campo part, and it was the battle between Isabela/Kara and JC/Freddie. Ramsay would ask Isabela and Kara what they made, and they’d tell him they went for a safe environment with a delicious pastel de choclo y pollo, a chicken dish with a corn cake base, complete with picked onions and peppers. Additionally, they’ve made it jerk chicken, where the marinade was a bit spicy, but less overpowering. The judges seemed intrigued by the presentation of the dish, noting how it’s a little tough to create such a dish like that, but the question is if it tastes good as it looks. Upon tasting a bite, they note how spicy it is, but Eileen asked what other ingredients they used for the sauce, to which Isabela states she used lime juice. Eileen compliments on how the acidity reduces the overall spicy tang in the sauce, and it makes the overall dish more worthy to eat. Ramsay agrees to it, also noting how delicious the corncake base was a surprise, but he can say it truly felt like he was eating in the countryside of Cuba. Freddie and JC were called up next to present their dish, and they would show their cuban sausage with a semi-spicy reduction sauce, and with a bit of orange mixed into their sauce. Eileen expresses her curiosity of orange used in the sauce, asking if they had their dish from the countryside, or even the shores. However, Ramsay does note how the presentation looks decent, but wonders if the dish is truly El Campo. The two judges took a bite from the sausage, and though JC was seen anxiously grimacing, Eileen stated that the dish was spicy, but the use of orange seemed to have taken off plenty of heat. Ramsay agreed, stating at first, he thought the semi-spicy reduction was spicy, but then he could feel the balance of sweetness and spice mixing together. Overall, the dish is very hearty; Eileen also added that she was afraid the dish would come off as more of a La Costa mixed with El Campo, but after tasting some of the spices in the mixture, it seemed a lot more El Campo, just more near the seashores, but at the same time, having an inland feel. Ultimately, they turn to each other, with Ramsay asking which dish she preferred. However, Eileen awkwardly chuckled in response, apologizing to Ramsay, but explaining both dishes reminded her of El Campo… She decides that both of them are worthy of a point, keeping both teams tied 2-2. In his confessional, JC is relieved to hear that his and Freddie’s dish managed to impress Eileen, while Kara makes her own one, stating that she needs to take plenty of lessons on how to be careful with making stuff spicy, but is thankful Isabela stepped in. 

The final portion was La Habana Urbana, calling for one duo from the Blue Team, as well as the soloist from the Red Team to come forward with their dishes. First turning to Sierra and Samuel, they would describe their dish; a stuffed plantain with ropa vieja steak, as well as a ‘graffiti drizzle’. When asked to describe their ‘graffiti dish’, Sierra would explain they’ve made it a bit contrasting in terms of colors; green being a cilantro-lime crema, sunset being a slightly spicy mango sauce with a hint of guava, red being a guajillo crema, and so on, so forth. Upon cutting into the dish, they’d find out that the steak was leathery tough to cut through, noting that it’s overcooked, much to Samuel and Sierra’s dismay, with the former stating in his confessional that he should’ve kept a better eye on it. Upon tasting it, however, Eileen would state that in spite of that, the dish itself is delicious. Ramsay would concur, but would say that had it not been the steak being overcooked, then it would’ve been a lot better, but they’ll have to see if it’ll fare best against the Red Team’s next dish. They’d turn their attention to Rio, who would present his deconstruction of a Cuban Sandwich; roasted pork with a rum-mustard caramel wrapped in ibérico ham, with garnishes of crisped brioche decked with garlic-butter, and melted quenelle streaks. Eileen would ask Rio what he was going for with this dish, and Rio would respond that he wanted to try a street vendor option, noting the nightlife of Havana, and though he’s never been to Cuba, he could imagine what places like there and Miami could offer as street food. Ramsay would notate how it almost looks like a tableside option to use for a potential service, stating how it looks pretty appetizing, but the question would be if it tastes as good as it looks. The two judges would cut into the meat, noting how beautifully cooked the pork looks, before each of them takes a bite. Eileen was the first to express her intrigue with the dish, stating that she could taste a little pickle acid in it, with Ramsay asking Rio if he used any pickle dusting for the dish, to which Rio confirmed, as well as a hint of plantain dusting. Eileen states to Rio that it’s important that pickle and mustard be used in Cuban sandwiches, as they push the acidity more than it already would’ve been. Ramsay says that the dish is pretty good… But is it worthy of receiving a point to break the tie…

And after careful deliberation between the two judges, they agree, earning Rio the third point. 

**3**\-2 (Red Team wins)

Rio was the first to celebrate, along with his teammates in back of him, as he would state in his confessional that even though he was never born in Cuba, he’s more than happy to show off his culinary attributes for the country. Eileen would clarify that the dish he concocted truly is a La Habana Urbana, stating it definitely sounds like a staple street food dish for samples, or to Ramsay’s case, tableside. As Rio reunited with his teammates, he was met with hugs from Kara and Isabela, with the latter stating in her confessional how happy she is that Rio won the challenge for them. Meanwhile, the Blue Team were living up to their namesake, being blue from learning they lost the challenge, with Sierra stating in her confessional that they win some, and they lose some, but she does know that there are some people who’re gonna have a day.

I got with her in November 2023 and she said “If I get with \[her\] I will have my feelings hurt”. For the first 3 months of the relationship everything was going well, we became very close very fast, we were intimate and affectionate. It was going well. I used to plan lots of things for us to do together. I took her places, we visited castles and all sorts of stuff. The relationship was the ideal “honeymoon period” of dating. When we used to have arguments I would stand my ground and she would back down because it was stupid (for example, I used to talk to a girl I worked with for a bit of fun to pass the time and my ex got mad when I told her I wasn’t into the girl… I wasn’t). 

After these first few months, it was her birthday and I took her on a nice trip and on the way home we had a large argument. I was staring into empty space on the train and some girls were sitting in my line of sight. One girl flashed her friends and I got up to go to the toilet. When I came back she was upset. I asked her why and she said it's because these girls said some really nasty stuff about me but wouldn’t tell me what it was. I got upset because she wouldn’t tell me and she got upset because I “didn’t understand the meaning of no” and that I could be mad at her if I wanted to be but she wouldn't tell me to “guard my feelings”. I got extremely upset at the train station and she said I “ruined” her birthday. When we got home she walked off in a fuss and didn't speak to me for days afterwards. When we finally spoke she gave me an ultimatum to either accept her meaning of no or we break up (essentially giving her a veto in the relationship). I stood my ground and said she is ridiculous and there has to be openness and honesty or this doesn’t work but I got threatened with a breakup so I caved. This is when I began to lose my assertiveness.

This dance would continue for some time. I would do something that I thought was perfectly fine, she would have a problem and cause an argument and I would just cave and let her win to keep the peace because she made me happy. I began to get incredibly stressed during this time and I lost my personality as I made it about her.

In March 2024 she broke up because she had enough of my passiveness. She wanted someone who could be assertive and “wear the pants”, a role which I had but slowly lost. The reason she gave for breaking up was just a compound of everything that had happened and what sent her over the edge was that I showed one of my friends her instagram account because he was curious what she was getting up to. This sent me into a deep sadness, not only because of this but my grandpa had died slightly earlier and I was really attracted to this girl - I didn’t want to lose her. I spent the rest of march trying to fix things and work things out and make it better but after talking to my friend he told me I would be better off not pursuing her and letting her come back once she realised she was being an idiot. Fast forward until June and I had pretty much gotten over her, I still messaged her frequently but I was feeling much better about myself and she ambushed me out of some exam I had to take. We spoke, I got on the train back with her and she was very apologetic and really upset about the way she had treated me. I was receptive but didn’t want to say anything because I wanted to see what happens. When I got off the train and went home we started talking and she was saying how “\[her\] thoughts are obsessed with \[me\]” and how “there hasn't been a day since we met that \[she hasn’t\] thought about \[me\[“. This reignited the emotions I felt for her and on that day I was hooked. We got back together soon after and laid some ground rules.

The EXACT same thing happened the second time around but much slower. I had her respect, admiration and I was assertive for a time and the same problems began to start but got worse. She saw me as lacking action and lacking urgency and we started to have small arguments again. I was getting very stressed at this time too but my love for her was more intense than these emotions. She didn’t take accountability, everything was her fault and when things didn’t go her way she would dangle the carrot of breaking up with me to “whip me” back into submission. On the surface she told me she wanted me to be assertive but if that assertion went against any of her plans, values or lifestyle it wasn’t allowed and I started to lose my personality again.

In October time we were applying to university and I pushed for us to go to the same school because I thought it would strengthen our relationship a lot to be together and experience university together. She wasn’t convinced at first but I managed to convince her after some time and everything was well. Our relationship got very strong during this time and I felt intense love for her bordering on limerence and I was overpresent and I filled most of my time with her.

Fast forward to March 2025 and this is where the main drama begins. She got rejected from my 1st choice university (A) and chose a different school whereas I still had to make my choice. I told her that I would go to her first choice university (B) so we could be together and share a house and have a wonderful time being together - I really really wanted this a lot, I wanted to marry her and have kids with her. She responded and said “don't do it, do  what makes you happy, I want you to be happy, don't come to uni with me, do what makes you happy” and I was struck with huge doubt in my relationship with her. I always viewed her as a very good person and very “great” and hearing that she had some indifference now damaged my view of how solid our relationship was. Everyday we would talk about it and everyday I would tell her that I was going to uni B and she would say “ok thats good” and we would do a dance, I would go home and talk to my friend and say “should I really do this, idk how I feel about this anymore” and I would get confused and upset. She told me during this time she was crying everyday for 3hrs+ and our relationship deteriorated. I had every intention to go to university with her and everyone in my life, and she was telling me otherwise. Everytime I tried to have a heart to heart with her about it and “tell her where my head was at” she would dismiss me and tell me to do what truly makes me happy and it's obvious I want uni A so I should go there. And every time I felt awful about it. This kept going on and on and on and on for months until May when she said “Firm B or we break up” and I firmed A on the spot because I was pissed off with her and I didn’t know what else to do.

For about a day I felt great and like I had a huge weight lifted off my shoulders and then the regret started to set in. I started to pine over her and stress about everything. I was upset and sad and it made the exams I had to do go worse than I expected (I didn’t know this at the time). A few weeks later, she blocked me but made a fake account to message me. She convinced me to start messaging her again and I did. She missed me, she wanted to figure things out, she loved me and wanted me to be happy. During the exams I messaged her a lot and I thought I was making progress, I drove her to the airport when she went on holiday and lent her my suitcase. She accidentally took my glasses too. When she was there she had an argument with me about me being weak and pathetic and we got over that and she really missed me on the phone so when we got back we had sex twice. I thought that she wanted to truly work things out with me. She acted like she was interested. After this I drove her to the beach and we had a great time (it was platonic, separate beds) but we did kiss and hold hands and enjoy each other's company (nothing sexual) and we got to talking but I was very nervous not to fuck anything up so I still had my silence about me. She messaged me the day after and said she couldn’t do it anymore and we needed to stop trying and it was over but I wasn’t convinced and the next few months I did everything I could to try and reignite some spark in the relationship.

I drove her to work everyday for a month, I bought her coffee and I took her places, I spent my birthday with her and we had a lot of fun messaging and just talking (we are really good friends). I made it VERY clear to her that if we were to remain friends it was because I was trying to pursue her and not because we wanted to be friends and she said ok.

I tried everything. I tried giving her weeks of space, I tried talking to her a lot, doing things for her, not doing things, being overly kind, being distant. No matter what I did it didn’t seem to do anything. All of this whilst being invited on trips with her, having dinner with her parents every Sunday (we didn't even do this when we were together) and being incredibly close with each other. All to no avail. I didn’t do anything here to be with her and I would’ve done it even if we were friends but a large part of me wants to be with her and I kept trying. I made it clear its what I wanted and she said “nono we are JUST friends” and then proceeded to act like we were together but in a platonic way.

There is a lot more here but that is the gist.

When we finally got our results, we both did worse than we expected. Probably due to the stress we both had about this, I barely missed the course I wanted and she had to choose a different course to go to the university she wanted. I offered to drive her as her Dad was going to pay me to do so and I really enjoy spending time with her. I told her 2 weeks before we were supposed to go exactly how I felt for her as 1 last ditch attempt to get her to feel anything and she went off at me and told me my thoughts should stay in my head, I ruined everything and a lot of other stuff including she didn't want me to take her to uni anymore.

The next day she messaged me, apologised, said she was confused and she rly wanted us to be friends and that I should take her to uni if I wanted to (It is important to note I was very very interested to take her to university so when she stopped me the day before I offered to take her free of charge to spend a little bit more time with her).

I took her to university and we had a great day. I went to my grandparents after and we spoke. I made plans with her. She cancelled on me at the last minute and as a last ditch (x2) I told her how I felt and she essentially said she can't do this anymore and we aren't going to message anymore. I was distraught.

This is where we are at. For the past 6 months I have been trying to get over a girl who wants NOTHING to do with me at all and I still love her. I know logically it's over but emotionally I feel I’m getting worse.

EXTRA INFO:

During this entire time she would insult me almost constantly, calling me weak and pathetic and a loser and that she deserves so much better than me. She can do no wrong in the relationship and everything was my fault. I lack assertion and all this other stuff. I accept all the blame for the way I acted about the university but she sees it as a huge betrayal and that I led her on. She sees it akin to cheating and her “trust” for me is gone, she doesn't admire me, respect me or anything anymore and has felt that way for months.

Since we broke up I have had limited contact with her, I wrote her a letter which she dismissed and sent me a HUGE wall of text about how I chose money over her and my morals are awful etc etc. I responded back telling her that I regret what happened and I have to live with that. I have to “feel” in the same way she has to “feel”.

I am fairly close with her parents and they have invited me over for dinner since we broke up where they told me that I deserve better than their daughter and that I have very good morals and goals for life and that I am a very smart, funny and good looking person and that I will find better in my life and whatever God wills, I will get.

She has a few mental things of her own that she needs to work through too.

There is a lot about her good and bad that makes our relationship look bad to the outsiders but many independent people use 70% her fault 30% my fault to look at our relationship as a whole. She was bad to me but I enabled it. She even blames me for her exam failures.

I feel led on and emotionally abused a little bit.

SINCE WE STOPPED TALKING:

I have started losing weight (I was quite overweight with her, I gained 22lbs with her) so I am trying to get back to a healthy weight. I am attending the gym too.

I have started to properly study to get back on my feet a bit.

I started a business with my dad.

I’m working longer hours at my job.

I have started seeing a fairly sympathetic therapist who tries to give me good advice here but also be realistic and I try to give a really unbiased view of our relationship to them because I want as realistic advice as possible.

I’m trying to take my mind off of her as best as I can.

WHY I’M MAKING THIS POST:

I don’t really know what I’m supposed to do or how I’m supposed to feel anymore. I know logically in my head it's over but in my heart it isn't and I would do whatever I have to do to make things right with her but I know it won't happen. My friends and family think I am cucked to her. I have days where I feel fine but others where I am hopelessly upset and I feel very very sad about it. I got drunk for the first time a few weeks ago and it just made me feel nothing about it. People have said time heals and makes you get over things but I do not feel like I am getting better. If I was to pursue this girl in the future (the low low chance she is even receptive) how do I even get to that point?

Essentially, I just want advice. I’m at a loss of what to do and it is affecting other parts of my life and the past 6 months have been the worst in my life.

If you want more info or anything feel free to comment, I won’t reveal everything but I can give you a more broad picture if you want.

TLDR: Broke up with my girlfriend of around 13months and left a rocky relationship. Instantly regretted it and tried to get back together with her with no success. The relationship wasn’t very good and yet I still want to be with her. I don’t know what to do to get myself back on the wagon after everything happened.",1,1762311539.0,Advice,6,0.67,False

So first off this is a new account I'll probably be using to post stuff like this so it is harder to trace back to me. I use my main username for way to many things, and I don't want this stuff dragging me down.

A little over a month ago I finally got my self a date, and it went well. The first date lasted 7 hours, and the second about the same. The 3rd one she came over and took my virginity. We continued to go on dates, and have sex at least once a week. 2 weeks ago I was pulled into a call with the council to make sure I knew it was only a physical relationship, and not to get attached or she might ruin me(she has BPD)

I thought things were going quite well aleast till last Sunday. She had a headache, but still wanted to come by and have some fun. She seamed a bit off, and withdrawn. She seamed to be enjoying things, but just wasn't into it as much as she normally was. I dropped her off at her place after getting some food with her. I figured she was just having a bad night. We've been chatting daily since(also thought it was going well)

I just got dumped over a discord call 30 minutes ago. Her main reason for doing so was my poor communication skills(both regular conversation, and dirty talk), and my difficulty interpreting body language. Apparently it felt like she was talking to a brick wall, and truthfully he hasn't really felt engaged in person for the last week(but she has had stints like this previously and blamed her BPD), so I didn't think much of it.

I just wish she brought up her concerns when they were fresh, and maybe we could have work through it

If anything I'm glad it happened now. while I liked her and wanted to keep being with her(truthfully I was gonna ask her out for coffee tomorrow, and ask if she was willing to take us serious), at least it happened before I became to emotional attached. 

The real gut punch is that she's the only person I've ever emotional connected with(excluding family), and opened up to about thing more then anyone else I'm my life(sad isn't it).

Shes always gonna be my first relationship, first intimate partner, and first time I've felt like I was capable of being in a relationship. While she felt I was an emotionless brick wall, I felt like I was talking to someone who cared about me, actually me.

I guess the ADHD interpersonal skills, and my messed up relationship with my emotions finally caught up to me. I think I'm gonna find my self a therapist, and start working on unpacking that mess.

I really just needed to write things down, vent about it, and sort my emotions. I knew it was never gonna long term, or end well(one or the other), at least it was fun while it lasted, and I've learned a lot about my self through the experience.

P.S. for a more on topic note Im working in using register level programing on an Arduino to work with SPI for a class, and man I sucks. I2C is so much easier.",1,1762311408.0,ADHD_Programmers,6,0.54,False

Farris – Good friendship. Shi teases Farris often for trying to act strong but likes his company. Occasionally gifts him clothes as a sign of friendship.
Rayku – Neutral relationship. She acknowledges Rayku’s skill but dislikes his mission of slaying demons. Though she once tried to kill him, she still treats him with unsettling kindness.

🩸 Summary Overview

Shi Koshaiya is a legendary anti-villain in Ara the Sea Demon, known as The Demon Queen Fox of Grace Flowers. She stands among the highest-ranking demons, feared and revered by both humans and demons alike. Her permanent, graceful smile hides a dark past — one tied to her mother’s attempt to teach her calmness and restraint. This training led Shi to develop her eternal smile, symbolizing serenity yet concealing unimaginable power.
As she grew, her strength evolved beyond the limits of her tribe, making her a near-mythical being. To demons, she’s a nightmare that cannot be challenged; to humans, she’s a haunting legend of beauty and death. Shi represents the perfect blend of love, sorrow, and darkness, forever smiling through the eternal night that surrounds her.

I average about 29km per run (878km ran in the past 6 months on Strava).

I also get very wet from sweat.

My concern is mostly with the risk of hypothermia or and that being cold and wet sucks.

To be safe, I figured I’d throw an emergency thermal blanket and use hand warmers on colder days. 



Other things I’m thinking:

I need multiple pairs of gloves/balaclavas because after 10-20 km the first set is soaked. Does anyone carry multiple sets for that reason?

I may need to loop longer runs at home so I can change into warm dry clothes if I can’t figure out the cold/wet problem.

I currently run in Hoka Bondi 9 (4E/x-wide) shoes. Does anyone have a trail shoe recommendation that is similar in width and cushioning?

Nutrition/fuel is way more important. Food = warmth + energy. Consider thermos with chicken noodle soup or coffee?

We're still about it. Sorting ourselves out. While my wife and I have been there together, and I've been to Chiang Mai maybe 5x since 2009, we never looked at it as a place to live until this year.

With that in mind, and given that I have to fly to Shanghai for business anyways, I'm going to spend 16 days in town beginning in December. I plan to talk to some real estate agents, visit a few schools and preschools, meet a nanny agency perhaps. I think it's really important to walk a few of these nice homes I'm seeing online and actually get a feel for the moobans, etc. Does anyone have any specific recommendations for agents and pro tips for toddler-parents that I should get a feel for while I'm visiting?

Does anyone have any specific locations that I should really check out for family life, neighborhoods I should see a few houses in and check the surrounds?

1oorbba,https://i.redd.it/0g2k0tsxpczf1.jpeg,Low Carb Apple Frangipane Cake,"In looking for a good low carb apple cake, I stumbled across this beauty. One of my favorite tarts is a poached pear and frangipane tart, which I would need to modify in order to make it low carb. Naturally, I was drawn to this cake because of its title.

I made the cake without an outer crust, hence me calling it more of a cake and not a tart. It’s basically kind of an almond flour apple coffee cake, which I’m here for! The cake is moist and flavorful, but it is a little crumbly. Luckily, it isn’t stodgy and the chopped walnuts add a wonderful flavor and crunch, so it works just fine as a dessert or snack with a nice cup of coffee. It isn’t quite the flavor or texture of my OG frangipane tart, but it’ll do as a low carb substitute.


Just a couple of notes about the recipe: 

First, I doubled the amount of apples used and placed thinly sliced apples on the top. I might do this next time, but it would work much better as an upside down cake in order to help the fruit not dry out.

Second, the author calls for apple extract in order to ramp up the apple flavor and keep the carb content low. I didn’t have apple extract and didn’t mind using 2 smallish apples. I figure that spreading 2 apples out over 9 servings still makes the carb content pretty negligible, especially since I used allulose as the sweetener. I also swapped out the apple extract for almond extract to give it more of the frangipane flavor. I’m sure it’ll be great either way.

I used a brownie pan lined with parchment. The recipe fits perfectly, and the cake holds together enough to transfer and individually wrap pieces for either fridge or freezer storage. I’m sure that the suggested round pan would be even prettier for serving.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_Tunnel?wprov=sfti1#) / [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273253/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) / Our Collection

Ok, I don’t mean to over-blow that post title but really - ((nods head)) - this is largely a story of how I came to be in possession of a CD Projects “Hard Case” Metal, Flip-Top Compact Disc Case - the metal, flip-top 24-disc storage solution known colloquially as:

**-The Box-**

The *very same Box* that I run 90%+ of our television programming out of. ((Looks around bumptiously)) Around here, it’s basically like holding the **Keys to the Kingdom**.

Just saying, it’s kind of a *big* deal.

+

From IMDb: Josh has an offer to ""go perm"" at his employer and the first task is to mail 17 high priority letters....something that seems a little difficult to do.

+

What’s that got to do with the price of java down at Blue Bottle Coffee? Quite a lot, actually.

Mrs. Lady Zedd and I were living in Sacramento at the time and had recently grabbed *Haiku Tunnel* from a bottom shelf of our local Blockbuster Video. The week before, she’d grabbed another little out of the way feature film - *The Royal Tenebaums* - from the same spot and we were beginning to think this little unfashionable, dust-laden corner was magic. It sure coughed up movies we enjoyed, for *true*.

The film came at a critical juncture… my few years of being a stay-at-home dad was coming to a close as our daughter, Little Miss Zedd, was coming into school-age. It was time for yours truly to *re-enter* the workforce but I was having trouble coming up with a suitable plan of action. Enter the Kornbluths - Josh and Jacob - and their sharp, intelligently sardonic film, *Haiku Tunnel*.

In the story, the fictional character “Josh”, living in the mythical city of “San Franclisco” works as a temporary legal secretary, where he tries very hard to have no long-term, meaningful connection to *anything* and enjoys many fine misadventures.

“Temping,” I thought, “now that might be an interesting way to jump start my career.” If you’ve ever been off work, even just over a week’s vacation, you know how difficult it can be to get back up to speed. After a few years off, taking care of our daughter, I figured temping might make the reconditioning of work hardening easier.

Here’s where **The Box** comes into the story - assuming I’d be sent all over the Sacramento area, I wanted a sturdy metal case to keep my discs safe and sound. Because it’s me - my first assignment was also my last… *just like the movie*, I wound up going “perm”. Turned out, I didn’t need The Box after all… or the new car I bought (the office was directly across the street).

((Blink-blink))

Other movie / life bleed over? During my tenure in Sacramento, I was shown to an enormous pile of backlogged work. Here’s the kicker - there wasn’t room for me in the department, so I was given a cubicle in a neighboring department. The next day, my supervisor was transferred to a different office and the incoming supervisor wasn’t told I existed. For months, I just kept showing up but I was essentially a *lost* employee. Nobody was looking over my shoulder, nobody asked me who I was, and I just listened to my music and processed the years long backlog.

See - I had found my own, disconnected *Haiku Tunnel*. I was a leaf, floating in the wind and I loved it at first but ((shrug)) over time, I got lonely. Days bled together, became weeks, weeks became months. The gig was up when I cleared the workload and one of the supervisors went looking to see where they went.

Not long after that, Mrs. Lady Zedd took a job in San Francisco and I transferred to our offices there - *just like in the movie* - I found myself suddenly working as a legal secretary (as much as I said I never would). *Haiku Tunnel* had proven a great primer for the stresses and strains of that profession. 

Finding myself overwhelmed, I took the advice offered Josh by his attorney “Bob”… I needed to go to my desk, settle down - FOCUS - and catch up! Oh, I took MLZ’s advice too… *never cry at your desk*.

The film’s humble earnings shouldn’t be taken as a negative - as a modest indie film of that time, it wasn’t a studio darling but I can tell you true, we found the story more enjoyable, more *real* than the standard big budget flicks that clog the suburban multiplexes. It may not be a name you recognize, but *Haiku Tunnel* has had an oversized impact on my life - whether it was intentional (me using it as job inspiration) or by irony (that temp job turning *perm* and then leading to a San Francisco law office).

What’s left to say - I’ll just take my CD Projects “Hard Case” Metal, Flip-Top Compact Disc Case, pull *Twin Peaks* out and settle into tonight’s exciting episode. Mrs. Lady Zedd says she looks over to The Box often, sitting up by the 4K player, and thinks about that time: when new adventures could be found on the bottom shelves of your local Blockbusters - it was a different time but the *movie on* here is just the same.

Movie on.

1oorad1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1oorad1/the_polishing_of_ghosts/,The Polishing of Ghosts,"My name is Subhash Das. For eleven years, I have been the senior custodian for the H**ton Psychiatric Suites on the seventh floor. A fancy name. It means I clean up after people’s minds have spilled. I arrive at six in the evening, when the doctors and their ghosts have gone home. My work is a quiet one. I believe a clean space makes for a clear mind, even if I am only cleaning the space and not the mind itself.

Dr. Anjali Sharma’s office, Suite 7B, was always my last stop and my favorite. She was a woman of order. Her desk was a landscape of precision: pens aligned like soldiers, patient files stacked with geometric perfection, a single, elegant brass lamp that cast a warm, steady light. Even the air in her room felt… settled. I would dust her shelves of thick books—Freud, Jung, Laing—and feel a kind of peace. I respected her. She was young, but she had an old soul’s stillness. She would sometimes still be there when I arrived, finishing her notes. She always greeted me by name. ""Good evening, Mr. Das. Thank you."" Not many do.

The change began in October, the month of shifting light. It started not with a bang, but with a smudge. A single, greasy fingerprint on the glass of her framed university degree. Dr. Sharma did not leave smudges. I polished it away, but it was like finding a crack in a perfect vase. A small thing, but it lets you know the whole structure is compromised.

The next week, it was a teacup, half-full of cold, jasmine-scented water, left on a bookshelf where a teacup did not belong. Beside it, a single marigold, its petals already starting to curl and brown. I threw the flower away and washed the cup, but the wrongness of it stayed with me. It was a disturbance in the room’s grammar.

I saw the man who must have been the cause. I only saw him in the waiting area, as my shift began and his session was ending. He was not remarkable. Not tall, not short. Not handsome, not ugly. He had the kind of face you would forget immediately, except for his eyes. They were completely still. When I emptied the wastebasket near the reception desk, he was watching me. Not with curiosity. Not with judgment. It was the way a scientist might watch a microbe under a lens. It made the hairs on my arms stand up. I nodded, a small gesture of courtesy. He did not react. When he left, the air in the waiting room seemed to thin, to grow colder.

After that, Dr. Sharma’s room began to reflect a new kind of chaos. Subtle, at first. A pen left uncapped. A file put back on the shelf upside down. These are the details a cleaner notices. We are students of human entropy. But then it grew. One evening, I found a stack of her notes had been knocked to the floor. Papers were scattered under her desk like fallen leaves. She was a woman who would have knelt immediately to put them in order. But they were left there, for me to find. As I gathered them, my eyes fell on a few lines she had scrawled on a notepad. *He is not the patient. I am the experiment.*

I pretended I had not seen it. My job is to erase the traces of the day, not to read them. But the words were like a burr, caught in the fabric of my thoughts.

My wife, Sarita, her lungs are not good. The doctor says it is fibrosis. I listen to her breathe at night, a shallow, rattling sound, like paper tearing. I know what it is to watch someone you care for become fragile, to see the container of their body start to fail. I started to see the same fragility in Dr. Sharma. Her crisp, professional posture began to slump. Dark circles, the color of old bruises, appeared under her eyes. One evening, she was on the phone as I began my rounds in the hallway. I could not help but overhear. Her voice was sharp with a sound I recognized: the edge of panic.

""No, Sameer, I am not 'just tired'!"" she whispered, her voice tight. ""You don't understand. It feels like… it feels like my thoughts are not my own. When I close my eyes…"" She stopped. I moved away, pushing my cart, the squeak of the wheels suddenly too loud. It is not my place to hear these things. But I heard them.

The patient, the unremarkable man, I learned his name was simply ""K"" from the sign-out sheet. K. A letter. An unknown variable. After his Tuesday sessions, the office was always worse. One Tuesday, I found a small, perfect pyramid of sugar cubes on her patient couch. Another time, the window was wide open, November cold pouring into the room, scattering papers. On her desk, a single sentence was written on her blotter, pressed so hard the ink had bled through. *The hands remember what the mind forgets.*

I began to worry. Not as an employee, but as a man. I have a daughter who is a teacher. Bright, capable, like Dr. Sharma. I see the world’s darkness and I want to shield them from it. But how do you shield someone from a ghost you can’t see?

The worst night was a Tuesday in late November. The clinic was empty. The silence was heavier than usual. As I approached Suite 7B, I saw the light was still on, a sliver under the door. I expected to find her working late. I knocked gently. ""Dr. Sharma? It is Subhash Das.""

No answer.

I waited. The protocol is clear: if a doctor is in, I come back later. But something felt wrong. I pushed the door open a few inches.

The room was bathed in the warm light of her brass lamp. Dr. Sharma was sitting in her chair, facing the window, her back to me. She was perfectly still. I thought she might be asleep.

""Doctor?"" I said, my voice softer this time.

She did not turn. She was just sitting there, staring out at the city lights, a constellation of distant fires. The room was immaculate. The pens were aligned. The books were straight. It was the most ordered I had ever seen it, more perfect than even her usual perfection. It was a sterile, breathless order. An order achieved after a great and terrible storm.

And then I saw it. On the polished surface of her mahogany desk, her hands were resting, palms up. And she was staring at them. She stared at her own hands with an expression of such profound, desolate horror, it was as if she had discovered two venomous spiders nesting in her lap. Her mouth was slightly open, and I could see, even from the doorway, that she was trembling, a fine, high-frequency vibration that seemed to run through her entire body.

I did not know what to do. To speak would be to break something. To leave felt like abandonment. For a long moment, we were frozen in that tableau: the doctor staring at her alien hands, and the cleaner, the invisible man, watching from the threshold. I saw in her face the look of someone who has stared into the abyss and seen their own reflection.

Quietly, I pulled the door until it was almost closed, leaving only a crack. I took my cart and went to the far end of the hallway, to the lounge, and began cleaning there. I made more noise than usual, humming an old film song my wife likes, running the buffer, creating a wall of ordinary sound to protect her. I was standing guard, in my own way. I was polishing the floors while she tried to polish a ghost from her soul.

An hour later, I saw her leave. She did not look at me. She walked like a woman made of glass, afraid a single misstep would shatter her.

The next week, her office was empty. Her name was gone from the door. A new doctor’s name was there, on a temporary plaque. I was told Dr. Sharma had taken an indefinite leave of absence. For her health.

Tonight, I cleaned Suite 7B. It belongs to a Dr. Matthews now. He leaves coffee rings on his desk and drops paper clips on the floor. He is a man of ordinary messes. As I was emptying Dr. Sharma’s—Dr. Matthews’—wastebasket, I found a small, personal card addressed to me. *Mr. Das, Thank you for your quiet diligence. It did not go unnoticed. Anjali Sharma.* Tucked inside was a crisp five-thousand-rupee note.

I am sitting in the empty lounge now, the clinic silent around me. I am holding her note. I will give the money to Sarita, for a new shawl. It is good money. But my heart is heavy. I think of that man, K, with his still eyes, and of Dr. Sharma, with her capable hands that became a source of terror. I do not understand what happened in that room. It is not my place to understand. My job is to clean what is left behind. But some messes cannot be wiped away. Some messes become part of the room itself, part of the memory of the walls. Tonight, as I polish the floors of Suite 7B, I know I am not just polishing wood and tile. I am polishing the space where a good woman fought a war, and I do not know if she won.",3,1762310434.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

1oor7z5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oor7z5,Dune Weaver Mini Pro — Build the perfect holiday present ✨,"**TL;DR:** Printable kinetic sand table, IKEA bowl base, \~$100-$150 total cost, open source software with tons of features, 1,500+ member Discord community. Free versions available on Makerworld to try first.

Hey everyone, I'm Tuan, maker of the Dune Weaver sand table. After months of refinement, I'm finally releasing the Mini Pro—and I genuinely think this is one of the most captivating things you can 3D print.

**What is it?** A kinetic sand table that traces hypnotic patterns in fine sand using a hidden magnet. You may have seen one in the wild before, but this one you build, instead of buying! Once you set it up, it becomes one of those things people just stare at—whether it's running in the background during a video call or sitting on your coffee table.

**A gift in three ways 🎁**

* Gift yourself the experience of building
* An ultimate gift for a loved one
* Gift the 3D printed parts + instructions

**What drove the Mini Pro design:**

I wanted this version to nail a few key things:

* **Printability first** – If it could be 3D printed, it should be. No relying on specialty hardware like timing belts or linear rails when a clever printed solution works better.
* **Use what's already out there** – Building around an IKEA BLANDA bowl means you're not hunting down obscure parts or spending a fortune on custom components.
* **Pass the living room test** – If it looks like a science experiment, it's staying in the garage.
* **Keep the cost reasonable** – Commercial options start at $130, use cheap motors, and go way up from there. This whole build comes in around $100-$150 (Cheaper if you have a lot of parts on hand or build in bulk).
* **Silence is golden** – Spent a lot of iteration on making this whisper-quiet. If you build the NEMA 17 version, you won't even know that it's running.
* **Build on what worked** – Took everything I learned from previous Dune Weavers and refined the mechanics, electronics integration, and added tons of software features.

**The Software (Open Source & Feature-Packed):** I've poured hundreds of hours into the software:

* Brand new UI for intuitive pattern browsing and control
* Integrated LED control – No separate ESP32 for WLED needed, LEDs controlled directly
* Still Sands – Scheduled downtime so it automatically rests when you want peace
* Auto-play on boot – Set it and forget it
* Home Assistant integration for smart home enthusiasts
* Network profiles & Wi-Fi hotspot mode for easy setup anywhere
* Extensive pattern library that the community keeps expanding

All software is completely open source and actively developed!

**Two build paths available:**

* Modern: NEMA 17 steppers with DLC32 or ESP32 board running FluidNC firmware
* Classic: 28BYJ-48 steppers with DWP electronics for a familiar build (coming soon)

**The experience:** This isn't just a print-and-forget project. It becomes a presence in your space. People stop by your desk at work asking about it. Kids are transfixed. You'll find yourself spacing out while watching new patterns emerge. It's genuinely meditative—and makes an unforgettable gift.

**Why build instead of buying?**

When you build the Dune Weaver Mini Pro, you get the satisfaction of creating something with your own hands, you understand exactly how it works (so you can fix or modify anything), and you're building on an open platform that you truly own. No cloud dependencies, no subscription fees, no planned obsolescence. Plus, the build itself is genuinely enjoyable—there's something special about watching it come to life piece by piece.

**What you get:**

* 🖨️ Print-ready STL files & 3MF
* 📋 Complete BOM with sourcing links
* 🛠️ Step-by-step assembly guide (hardware → wiring → software)
* 💬 Access to our 1,500+ member Discord community – The Discord is buzzing with builders sharing custom patterns, troubleshooting tips, creative mods, and new features. You're not just getting files—you're joining makers who are pushing this platform forward together.

**Common questions:**

*""Do I need advanced electronics knowledge?""* Nope. If you can wire up basic components and follow a diagram, you're good to go.

*""Is the Raspberry Pi hard to set up?""* Not at all—the detailed guide walks you through everything step by step, from flashing the SD card to getting your first pattern running.

*""What if I get stuck during the build?""* The 1,500+ member Discord community is incredibly helpful and responsive. Most questions get answered within minutes.

*""Can I customize it later?""* Absolutely! The open source software means you can tweak anything, and the community is constantly creating new patterns and mods.

**Want something bigger or free?**

* Looking for a larger table? Check out the full-size DWP (also available on Patreon)
* Want to try before you buy? I have 2 free tables on Makerworld: the original Dune Weaver (OG) and the Dune Weaver Mini

Perfect timing if you want to build something truly special before the holidays—and actually have something impressive to show for all that printer runtime 😅

## Why a Thoughtful Gift Beats a Pricey One Every Time

In a world of instant gratification, a thoughtful gift is a powerful statement. It says you spent time considering what would make someone happy. The best **christmas gifts** aren't always the most expensive; they are the most personal. A well-chosen gift strengthens a connection, creates a lasting memory, and shows a level of care that a generic gift card simply can't replicate. This year, let's aim for impact, not just impulse.

Before you even open a browser, channel your inner detective. The best ideas are often hidden in plain sight.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts)

1.  **Listen for Hints:** In the months leading up to Christmas, people drop hints without even realizing it. ""My old headphones are crackling,"" ""I'd love to learn how to make pasta,"" or ""I'm so stressed lately."" Keep a note on your phone and jot these down.
2.  **Analyze Their Hobbies:** What do they do for fun? The avid gardener, the weekend gamer, the aspiring chef, the fitness fanatic—each hobby is a goldmine for specific, useful, and appreciated gifts.
3.  **Identify a Problem:** Can you solve a small, everyday annoyance for them? Do they always lose their keys? Are their coffee mugs perpetually lukewarm? A gift that solves a problem is a gift that keeps on giving.
4.  **Think in Experiences:** Sometimes the best gift isn't a *thing* at all. Concert tickets, a cooking class, a weekend getaway, or a spa day creates a memory that lasts far longer than a physical object.

I think its been about 3 months since i've ended things with my ex. I would be lying if I said it didn't hurt to end it the way that it did, especially when I had the best memories with her compared to my first. I've been in a rut, not feeling like myself and lost interest in things. I've been trying to fix myself by going out again and spending some time with friends and family. But the pain comes back at the end of the day whenever I have to shut the lights and all memories comes rushing in. I can't keep going like this and as much as I want to forget her, I just can't. Her leaving my life like that left a hole in my chest and I don't know anyone who can fill that hole. Dating isn't easy, like how you do try to start an intimate relationship again. I guess i've been pretty lucky with the past two. Just trying my luck here I guess and hope that I meet someone. I'm not in rush to go to in serious relationship,  we can take some time to know each other. I just want to feel that feeling of having a special someone again. And i'm hoping that I could finally let go and do things right this time.

In the summer of 1983, I was thirty two and running the local Cinema in a small town tucked into the foothills of Colorado. 

It was an old three screen theater that smelled of butter and mildew. I kept it going generally alone. Refilling popcorn machines, fixing jammed projectors, locking up after midnight. All dependent on the day, it was a simple job though mind numbingly boring. 

It was meant to be a temporary gig. My real work was teaching high school history. But the district had made cuts, and this was what helped pay the bills until I was called back in.



One Thursday, near closing, I was sweeping popcorn out of Screen Two when the projector clicked on by itself.
No one else was there.

The film canister turning above me was unlabeled, an old silver reel I didn’t remember unpacking. In face I don’t remember ever seeing it. I was the only one on shift anyway, I didn’t know who could have played it. 

I looked over to see the house lights had dimmed.

On the screen, clouds rolled across a black sky. Thunder cracked, lightning split the horizon and four riders appeared. Shapes on horses, half human, half storm.

They galloped toward the camera, closer,  and closer until they filled the frame.

One rode a pale horse at the front, its skin stretched over bones, eyes burning like cold fire. A sword beside him glinted white.

He leaned forward, raising it toward me, laughing manically and looking seemingly into my soul. 

I stumbled back screaming, tripped over a seat, hit the sticky floor. The blade came down

Then everything went black.

When I opened my eyes, the screen was blank.
The projector was silent.

Dust hung in the beam of my flashlight.

I ran.

I burst through the doors leading to the halls/lobby and froze.

The carpet was gone.
Posters hung in tatters.
The concession stand was rotted wood and broken glass.

The whole building looked decades older, as if time had skipped ahead fifty years and taken everyone with it.

Everything that wasn’t in total ruin, was otherwise in a state of complete and utter decay. Nothing was recognizable, I whipped my head around terrified.   


Outside, the parking lot was cracked and overgrown. My car sat under a layer of dust thick as ash. All the other cars donning a similar appearance, it looked as though the whole area was destroyed. 


I drove home anyway, heart pounding.

When I walked in, the house looked normal again. My wife Laurie was on the couch watching the news.

“You’re pale,” she said. “Rough night?”

“Just… a long day at work,” I told her. 

I didn’t know what else to say, was I going crazy? Hallucinating? I didn’t do any form of drugs and barely drank, let alone ever at work. 
After a bit I convinced even myself it truly was just a long day at work…


The next morning, I awoke to the television on.

News anchors murmuring about rising tensions with the USSR, troop movements, possible escalation. Laurie had already left for work.

I made eggs, half listening. The tone of the broadcast wavered, full of static.

I switched off the stove just as the reporter’s voice changed flattened, metallic.

As I was already more than halfway out the door, I could have swore I heard him say

“You will join us, Jim”. 


Work was normal that day.
I made the popcorn. Tore and handed out tickets, teenagers clearly skipping either went to the arcade or went to a movie. 

I spent the evening reviewing security footage from the night before

Nothing. 

The projector had never turned on. The reel didn’t exist.

I told myself I was exhausted.


When I got home, Laurie and I made dinner, watched an old movie on VHS, talked about how things would be better when I got my teaching job back. For a while, it felt like ordinary life again.

We went to bed early.


Something woke me a pressure in my chest, then the sudden need to use the bathroom.

The house was dark except for the dim sliver of streetlight through the blinds.

In the bathroom, I heard footsteps in the hall. Slow, dragging.

“Laurie?” I called.

No answer.

When I opened the door, the hallway wasn’t our hallway anymore. 

Wallpaper peeled like old skin. 

Ceiling lights flickered behind clouds of smoke.

At the far end stood a man in silver armor, eyes like coals, bow drawn  

He laughed as he shot an arrow directed straight to my chest-

I woke up screaming.

Sweat soaked the sheets. Laurie stirred beside me, confused.

“What the hell Jim, are you okay?”

“Just a dream.”

I skipped work that morning and drove straight to the high school.
No one was there, summer break kept the place empty.

In my old classroom, dust covered the desks. I went to the bookshelf, searching for anything that made sense. I don’t know what i expected to find, but I needed answers to impossible questions. 

A world cultures history compendium fell open near the back

The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

Conquest. War. Famine. Death.

Harbingers of catastrophe, riding before great wars and disasters.

My hands shook.

Id seen two of the figures in that picture before. 
One at the theater, the other in my home. 

Then a television I didn’t remember being in the room flickered on in the corner. 

The same news anchor as that morning, voice distorted. 

He spoke rapidly of nuclear tensions, Soviet missiles, “end of days.”

I slammed the door and ran out. 



The hallway reeked intensely of rot.
Flies buzzed in thick clouds.

From the darkness ahead, a horse’s hoof struck the tile, another figure stepped into view.
I recognized him from the picture I had just seen,

“Famine”. 


He was skeletal, skin drawn tight over bones that jutted through in splintered angles.

Sores crawled up his neck, oozing dark almost black fluid.

His eyes were milky white, mouth split in a grin full of cracked, rotted teeth.

Around him swarmed flies, so intensely dense they moved thickly like smoke. 

Every breath he took clattered, like a death rattle amplified through an empty chest cavity.

I ran, faster than I even knew possible for myself. It felt as though my feet were levitated off of the floor, and I was flying  to the parking lot. 

He followed, each hoofbeat shaking the floor.


I burst into sunlight, into my car, into immediate motion without looking back. 

Behind me, three riders appeared on the ridge 
Conquest, Famine, Death. 

All charging through the heat haze, their laughter carrying over the wind.

The sky turned a deep black. 
Lightning flared purple, striking the ground all around the three horsemen. 

I pressed the pedal to the floor, engine screaming, eyes stinging from sweat.

Then I saw him ahead on the road-

War. 

Perched upon a red horse, sword blazing like molten iron.

He raised it as I violently swerved.

The car spun off the asphalt, tumbling multiple times until finally landing in a ditch.

Metal crunched. 
Glass shattered. 
I could feel the hot, thick, oozing blood running down my face. Beginning to blur my vision. 
My ears rang so loud, it felt as though I was in front of church bells. 
All I could taste was iron. 

Through the wreckage I saw them closing in.

War dismounted, his armor glowing like embers.

He knelt beside the broken window, smiled. 

I could read his lips perfectly. 

“Too late, James.”


Then complete darkness. 


When I woke, I was lying on cold metal.

I was in a room I had never seen before, or had I?

It didn’t look recognizable, though I couldn’t remember anything. My mind was a complete blank slate. 

I wandered through narrow corridors. 

After about twenty minutes, I had found an exit hatch half buried in debris. 

I climbed out to sunlight that didn’t feel real.

The town was gone.

Buildings collapsed, streets melted. 

Cars twisted into rusted sculptures. 

Decomposing bones lay where people once stood.

The mountains smoked on the horizon.

I walked for hours, calling Laurie’s name, until I reached our house.

Inside, everything was ash or rot. 

Her side of the bed was empty.

I sat on the couch and cried until I couldn’t breathe.

When I looked up, the television was sitting on the coffee table, still intact.

Next to it lay the same history book from my classroom, open to the page about the Horsemen.

I read the line twice, tracing it with a shaking finger

“They appear as warning before great destruction before humanity’s own undoing.”

Then it all came back to me. 

The crash, the horseman, everything. 

I read over that passage again, then stared at the tv. 

I remembered the news reports. “Russians”, “War”, “Nuclear Bombs”. 

Outside, the wind picked up, carrying the sound of hoofbeats.

In the summer of 1983, I was thirty two and running the local Cinema in a small town tucked into the foothills of Colorado. 

It was an old three screen theater that smelled of butter and mildew. I kept it going generally alone. Refilling popcorn machines, fixing jammed projectors, locking up after midnight. All dependent on the day, it was a simple job though mind numbingly boring. 

It was meant to be a temporary gig. My real work was teaching high school history. But the district had made cuts, and this was what helped pay the bills until I was called back in.



One Thursday, near closing, I was sweeping popcorn out of Screen Two when the projector clicked on by itself.
No one else was there.

The film canister turning above me was unlabeled, an old silver reel I didn’t remember unpacking. In face I don’t remember ever seeing it. I was the only one on shift anyway, I didn’t know who could have played it. 

I looked over to see the house lights had dimmed.

On the screen, clouds rolled across a black sky. Thunder cracked, lightning split the horizon and four riders appeared. Shapes on horses, half human, half storm.

They galloped toward the camera, closer,  and closer until they filled the frame.

One rode a pale horse at the front, its skin stretched over bones, eyes burning like cold fire. A sword beside him glinted white.

He leaned forward, raising it toward me, laughing manically and looking seemingly into my soul. 

I stumbled back screaming, tripped over a seat, hit the sticky floor. The blade came down

Then everything went black.

When I opened my eyes, the screen was blank.
The projector was silent.

Dust hung in the beam of my flashlight.

I ran.

I burst through the doors leading to the halls/lobby and froze.

The carpet was gone.
Posters hung in tatters.
The concession stand was rotted wood and broken glass.

The whole building looked decades older, as if time had skipped ahead fifty years and taken everyone with it.

Everything that wasn’t in total ruin, was otherwise in a state of complete and utter decay. Nothing was recognizable, I whipped my head around terrified.   


Outside, the parking lot was cracked and overgrown. My car sat under a layer of dust thick as ash. All the other cars donning a similar appearance, it looked as though the whole area was destroyed. 


I drove home anyway, heart pounding.

When I walked in, the house looked normal again. My wife Laurie was on the couch watching the news.

“You’re pale,” she said. “Rough night?”

“Just… a long day at work,” I told her. 

I didn’t know what else to say, was I going crazy? Hallucinating? I didn’t do any form of drugs and barely drank, let alone ever at work. 
After a bit I convinced even myself it truly was just a long day at work…


The next morning, I awoke to the television on.

News anchors murmuring about rising tensions with the USSR, troop movements, possible escalation. Laurie had already left for work.

I made eggs, half listening. The tone of the broadcast wavered, full of static.

I switched off the stove just as the reporter’s voice changed flattened, metallic.

As I was already more than halfway out the door, I could have swore I heard him say

“You will join us, Jim”. 


Work was normal that day.
I made the popcorn. Tore and handed out tickets, teenagers clearly skipping either went to the arcade or went to a movie. 

I spent the evening reviewing security footage from the night before

Nothing. 

The projector had never turned on. The reel didn’t exist.

I told myself I was exhausted.


When I got home, Laurie and I made dinner, watched an old movie on VHS, talked about how things would be better when I got my teaching job back. For a while, it felt like ordinary life again.

We went to bed early.


Something woke me a pressure in my chest, then the sudden need to use the bathroom.

The house was dark except for the dim sliver of streetlight through the blinds.

In the bathroom, I heard footsteps in the hall. Slow, dragging.

“Laurie?” I called.

No answer.

When I opened the door, the hallway wasn’t our hallway anymore. 

Wallpaper peeled like old skin. 

Ceiling lights flickered behind clouds of smoke.

At the far end stood a man in silver armor, eyes like coals, bow drawn  

He laughed as he shot an arrow directed straight to my chest-

I woke up screaming.

Sweat soaked the sheets. Laurie stirred beside me, confused.

“What the hell Jim, are you okay?”

“Just a dream.”

I skipped work that morning and drove straight to the high school.
No one was there, summer break kept the place empty.

In my old classroom, dust covered the desks. I went to the bookshelf, searching for anything that made sense. I don’t know what i expected to find, but I needed answers to impossible questions. 

A world cultures history compendium fell open near the back

The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

Conquest. War. Famine. Death.

Harbingers of catastrophe, riding before great wars and disasters.

My hands shook.

Id seen two of the figures in that picture before. 
One at the theater, the other in my home. 

Then a television I didn’t remember being in the room flickered on in the corner. 

The same news anchor as that morning, voice distorted. 

He spoke rapidly of nuclear tensions, Soviet missiles, “end of days.”

I slammed the door and ran out. 



The hallway reeked intensely of rot.
Flies buzzed in thick clouds.

From the darkness ahead, a horse’s hoof struck the tile, another figure stepped into view.
I recognized him from the picture I had just seen,

“Famine”. 


He was skeletal, skin drawn tight over bones that jutted through in splintered angles.

Sores crawled up his neck, oozing dark almost black fluid.

His eyes were milky white, mouth split in a grin full of cracked, rotted teeth.

Around him swarmed flies, so intensely dense they moved thickly like smoke. 

Every breath he took clattered, like a death rattle amplified through an empty chest cavity.

I ran, faster than I even knew possible for myself. It felt as though my feet were levitated off of the floor, and I was flying  to the parking lot. 

He followed, each hoofbeat shaking the floor.


I burst into sunlight, into my car, into immediate motion without looking back. 

Behind me, three riders appeared on the ridge 
Conquest, Famine, Death. 

All charging through the heat haze, their laughter carrying over the wind.

The sky turned a deep black. 
Lightning flared purple, striking the ground all around the three horsemen. 

I pressed the pedal to the floor, engine screaming, eyes stinging from sweat.

Then I saw him ahead on the road-

War. 

Perched upon a red horse, sword blazing like molten iron.

He raised it as I violently swerved.

The car spun off the asphalt, tumbling multiple times until finally landing in a ditch.

Metal crunched. 
Glass shattered. 
I could feel the hot, thick, oozing blood running down my face. Beginning to blur my vision. 
My ears rang so loud, it felt as though I was in front of church bells. 
All I could taste was iron. 

Through the wreckage I saw them closing in.

War dismounted, his armor glowing like embers.

He knelt beside the broken window, smiled. 

I could read his lips perfectly. 

“Too late, James.”


Then complete darkness. 


When I woke, I was lying on cold metal.

I usually hit the gym in the evening to reset before sitting down to work on my business, but I often end up feeling foggy and struggling to focus.

I’m sensitive to caffeine, so stopped coffee and energy drinks. Lately, I’ve been drinking kombucha (since it has a bit of tea), which helps a little — but not much. I see others taking focus or nootropic supplements and wonder if they actually help.

Everything that wasn’t in total ruin, was otherwise in a state of complete and utter decay. Nothing was recognizable, I whipped my head around terrified.   


Outside, the parking lot was cracked and overgrown. My car sat under a layer of dust thick as ash. All the other cars donning a similar appearance, it looked as though the whole area was destroyed. 


I drove home anyway, heart pounding.

When I walked in, the house looked normal again. My wife Laurie was on the couch watching the news.

“You’re pale,” she said. “Rough night?”

“Just… a long day at work,” I told her. 

I didn’t know what else to say, was I going crazy? Hallucinating? I didn’t do any form of drugs and barely drank, let alone ever at work. 
After a bit I convinced even myself it truly was just a long day at work…


The next morning, I awoke to the television on.

News anchors murmuring about rising tensions with the USSR, troop movements, possible escalation. Laurie had already left for work.

I made eggs, half listening. The tone of the broadcast wavered, full of static.

I switched off the stove just as the reporter’s voice changed flattened, metallic.

As I was already more than halfway out the door, I could have swore I heard him say

“You will join us, Jim”. 


Work was normal that day.
I made the popcorn. Tore and handed out tickets, teenagers clearly skipping either went to the arcade or went to a movie. 

I spent the evening reviewing security footage from the night before

Nothing. 

The projector had never turned on. The reel didn’t exist.

I told myself I was exhausted.


When I got home, Laurie and I made dinner, watched an old movie on VHS, talked about how things would be better when I got my teaching job back. For a while, it felt like ordinary life again.

We went to bed early.


Something woke me a pressure in my chest, then the sudden need to use the bathroom.

The house was dark except for the dim sliver of streetlight through the blinds.

In the bathroom, I heard footsteps in the hall. Slow, dragging.

“Laurie?” I called.

No answer.

When I opened the door, the hallway wasn’t our hallway anymore. 

Wallpaper peeled like old skin. 

Ceiling lights flickered behind clouds of smoke.

At the far end stood a man in silver armor, eyes like coals, bow drawn  

He laughed as he shot an arrow directed straight to my chest-

I woke up screaming.

Sweat soaked the sheets. Laurie stirred beside me, confused.

“What the hell Jim, are you okay?”

“Just a dream.”

I skipped work that morning and drove straight to the high school.
No one was there, summer break kept the place empty.

In my old classroom, dust covered the desks. I went to the bookshelf, searching for anything that made sense. I don’t know what i expected to find, but I needed answers to impossible questions. 

A world cultures history compendium fell open near the back

The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

Conquest. War. Famine. Death.

Harbingers of catastrophe, riding before great wars and disasters.

My hands shook.

Id seen two of the figures in that picture before. 
One at the theater, the other in my home. 

Then a television I didn’t remember being in the room flickered on in the corner. 

The same news anchor as that morning, voice distorted. 

He spoke rapidly of nuclear tensions, Soviet missiles, “end of days.”

I slammed the door and ran out. 



The hallway reeked intensely of rot.
Flies buzzed in thick clouds.

From the darkness ahead, a horse’s hoof struck the tile, another figure stepped into view.
I recognized him from the picture I had just seen,

“Famine”. 


He was skeletal, skin drawn tight over bones that jutted through in splintered angles.

Sores crawled up his neck, oozing dark almost black fluid.

His eyes were milky white, mouth split in a grin full of cracked, rotted teeth.

Around him swarmed flies, so intensely dense they moved thickly like smoke. 

Every breath he took clattered, like a death rattle amplified through an empty chest cavity.

I ran, faster than I even knew possible for myself. It felt as though my feet were levitated off of the floor, and I was flying  to the parking lot. 

He followed, each hoofbeat shaking the floor.


I burst into sunlight, into my car, into immediate motion without looking back. 

Behind me, three riders appeared on the ridge 
Conquest, Famine, Death. 

All charging through the heat haze, their laughter carrying over the wind.

The sky turned a deep black. 
Lightning flared purple, striking the ground all around the three horsemen. 

I pressed the pedal to the floor, engine screaming, eyes stinging from sweat.

Then I saw him ahead on the road-

War. 

Perched upon a red horse, sword blazing like molten iron.

He raised it as I violently swerved.

The car spun off the asphalt, tumbling multiple times until finally landing in a ditch.

Metal crunched. 
Glass shattered. 
I could feel the hot, thick, oozing blood running down my face. Beginning to blur my vision. 
My ears rang so loud, it felt as though I was in front of church bells. 
All I could taste was iron. 

Through the wreckage I saw them closing in.

War dismounted, his armor glowing like embers.

He knelt beside the broken window, smiled. 

I could read his lips perfectly. 

“Too late, James.”


Then complete darkness. 


When I woke, I was lying on cold metal.

I was in a room I had never seen before, or had I?

It didn’t look recognizable, though I couldn’t remember anything. My mind was a complete blank slate. 

I wandered through narrow corridors. 

After about twenty minutes, I had found an exit hatch half buried in debris. 

I climbed out to sunlight that didn’t feel real.

The town was gone.

Buildings collapsed, streets melted. 

Cars twisted into rusted sculptures. 

Decomposing bones lay where people once stood.

The mountains smoked on the horizon.

I walked for hours, calling Laurie’s name, until I reached our house.

Inside, everything was ash or rot. 

Her side of the bed was empty.

I sat on the couch and cried until I couldn’t breathe.

When I looked up, the television was sitting on the coffee table, still intact.

Next to it lay the same history book from my classroom, open to the page about the Horsemen.

I read the line twice, tracing it with a shaking finger

“They appear as warning before great destruction before humanity’s own undoing.”

Then it all came back to me. 

The crash, the horseman, everything. 

I read over that passage again, then stared at the tv. 

I remembered the news reports. “Russians”, “War”, “Nuclear Bombs”. 

Outside, the wind picked up, carrying the sound of hoofbeats.

1oor2bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oor2bt/wife_lost_it_on_me_after_family_dinner_and_things/,Wife lost it on me after family dinner and things got physical,"My wife of three years completely lost her mind after we got back from my brother's place tonight. The whole thing started because my brother and I were looking through his old photo albums and cracking up about the ridiculous haircuts everyone had in the 90s. My wife's mom was in a few of the pictures (they grew up in the same town), and my brother made some joke about how everyone had those giant permed bangs back then. I chuckled. That was it. Nothing mean-spirited at all.

Cut to later when we're back at our apartment. She suddenly mutes the TV show we were watching and starts going off about my relationship with my brother. How it's weird that we text each other funny memes. How it's suspicious that I don't fight with my family like she does with hers. She kept saying my family is ""too nice"" and it makes her uncomfortable.

So I'm sitting on the couch scrolling through my phone, trying to decompress from the day. She starts up again about something completely random I apparently did wrong last week. I'm barely paying attention at this point. So I did what seemed smart and just stayed quiet, let her get it all out without adding fuel to the fire. Huge mistake.

I glanced back down at my phone for maybe five seconds. Next thing I know, she's on me. Three solid punches landed before I even processed what was happening. I stood up fast to get some distance, and she slapped me hard enough that my ears rang. Then she runs to the apartment door, throws it open, and plants herself in the doorway screaming at me to stay away from her while literally blocking my only way out.

I'm standing there in my gym shorts trying to find my phone that slid under the coffee table. She's yelling loud enough for the entire floor to hear, making it sound like I'm the one doing something to her.

Right now I'm sitting in my car in the parking garage wearing gym shorts and a t-shirt with a split lip, and I figured I'd ask you guys what the hell I'm supposed to do here.",333,1762309811.0,Advice,300,0.96,False

1oor20g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianTeachers/comments/1oor20g/is_there_a_balancing_test_to_determine_when/,Is there  a “balancing test” to determine when  professional boundaries are unprofessional,"
My students aren’t my friends, but I maintain the same type of professional relationship with them as other teachers do — one that includes clear boundaries. The challenge is that there isn’t a well-defined balancing test that objectively separates professionalism from personal connection. Much of what’s discussed on Reddit only provides implicit or informal examples of what’s considered acceptable or not. I am thinking of becoming a principal and am trying to take on some more responsibilities to help younger staff members. 

As for professional standards, is the Ontario College ofTeachers (OCT) document legally binding? , since it outlines the official Standards of Practice and Professional Boundaries expected of certified educators. I printed a poster put the OCT poster and put it in the classroom to that I can have a professional relationship while maintaining a close enough relationship to maintain order and morale in the classroom. 

Can any other teachers confidently say that these are the main boundaries. I think the  term “teacher but not friends” is very socially constructed and could mean very different things for different ages, backgrounds, and geographical background, Ontario is very diverse. I don’t want teachers to avoid making a “a close professional relationship” since they are too afraid of getting into trouble or get into legal  action because they don’t have a clear idea of boundaries.  I’m only saying because I see a lot of “what does  this professional relationship mean” on reddit. Nobody really gave  a long through legally binding “ code of conduct” that serves as a social contract between teachers students and the province. I have enough experience to instinctively know if something is appropriate or not but not all teacher candidates do.


So can all confidently say that teachers say this is “ the explicit code “ that is made by a regulatory agency and is legally binding for all teachers, students and teacher candidates to dollow. I go over this with all my students  at beginning of year that way we can have a good professional relationship without any confusion and kids testing boundaries.

My name is Jim.
In the summer of 1983, I was thirty two and running the local Cinema in a small town tucked into the foothills of Colorado. 

It was an old three screen theater that smelled of butter and mildew. I kept it going generally alone. Refilling popcorn machines, fixing jammed projectors, locking up after midnight. All dependent on the day, it was a simple job though mind numbingly boring. 

It was meant to be a temporary gig. My real work was teaching high school history. But the district had made cuts, and this was what helped pay the bills until I was called back in.



One Thursday, near closing, I was sweeping popcorn out of Screen Two when the projector clicked on by itself.
No one else was there.

The film canister turning above me was unlabeled, an old silver reel I didn’t remember unpacking. In face I don’t remember ever seeing it. I was the only one on shift anyway, I didn’t know who could have played it. 

I looked over to see the house lights had dimmed.

On the screen, clouds rolled across a black sky. Thunder cracked, lightning split the horizon and four riders appeared. Shapes on horses, half human, half storm.

They galloped toward the camera, closer,  and closer until they filled the frame.

One rode a pale horse at the front, its skin stretched over bones, eyes burning like cold fire. A sword beside him glinted white.

He leaned forward, raising it toward me, laughing manically and looking seemingly into my soul. 

I stumbled back screaming, tripped over a seat, hit the sticky floor. The blade came down

Then everything went black.

When I opened my eyes, the screen was blank.
The projector was silent.

Dust hung in the beam of my flashlight.

I ran.

I burst through the doors leading to the halls/lobby and froze.

The carpet was gone.
Posters hung in tatters.
The concession stand was rotted wood and broken glass.

The whole building looked decades older, as if time had skipped ahead fifty years and taken everyone with it.

Everything that wasn’t in total ruin, was otherwise in a state of complete and utter decay. Nothing was recognizable, I whipped my head around terrified.

I dont know that to say here, like honestly, I drank a whole bottle of vodka by myself, a one litre one at that, so my brain is not available right now. My drinking companion fell asleep already :c Now I'm lonely while I'm finishing the last bit of my vodka. I'm not alcoholic by the way! I just drink once per month, and today is the day of this month! I swear :3

Anyone who had their drinking companion fall asleep on them probably can relate :c its sad, well for me it is! Like, I'm so hypers! And I feel like my brain is running on light speed right now, so many silly thoughts, like jokes I'd never make when sober! I'm just full of sillyness right now!   
  
On another note though, I'm also known as the most wholesome drinker EU west! I never, ever in my life got aggressive so far when being drunk! And also some say, I drink vodka like water. It makes them gag when they see how i drink my alcohol pure in big gulps like water ...

That was not intended as a flex originally, I promise, but it ended up as that! AHAHA! 

Anyways, is anyone else drinking right now? If yes I take a big shot in honour of you! I dont have many left though. I also take my shots out of a coffee mug! LMAO ... I dont have any shot glasses .... ",4,1762309610.0,drunk,18,0.83,False

1ooqyaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMarketing/comments/1ooqyaf/are_there_commision_based_marketers/,Are there commision based marketers?,"My boss created a company called Vibe or Vent and we talk to people that need someone to talk to. You might be surprised at the amount of lonely people out there. But all of us employees are just here and paid to talk with people. None of us know how to market. My boss gave us the ability to come onto Reddit and help people with the hope that it would possibly create some more clients, but we have only had a handful of people call from here. We try to help people any time that we can here, but most of us are booked with calls so it just is not a long term solution.

  
We have been receiving a ton of business from simple flyers posted in coffee shops, bookstores, etc. so we know that it is something that has demand. But we are not marketers and don't really know where to start to reach more people.

  
So, we are looking for someone that would take us to new heights with their ability to run a marketing campaign, however they deem best. There really are no limits here, other than legal and ethical boundaries. And we would be happy to pay a commission for any clients that book a call, which could really be thousands every month for someone that really knows how to get the message out there.

  
Do commission based marketers exist, if so how do I find them? And if now, are there any little things that us employees could be doing to market this company better? We tried to get TikTok to go off, created some social media pages, but nothing seems to really give us the explosion we would like.



We know we are helping people, we know there is demand, and we are all trained listeners, but not actual therapists; meaning we don't have to prescribe or diagnose anyone. But how do we reach these people? Any help would be appreciated!",1,1762309496.0,AskMarketing,1,1.0,False

1ooqvq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overcome_PE/comments/1ooqvq2/why_natural_formulas_dont_always_have_clinical/,Why Natural Formulas Don’t Always Have Clinical Trials (Yet Still Work),"Here’s something I’ve learned after going down a deep rabbit hole of “natural” supplements and delay sprays — not everything that works has a fancy clinical trial behind it. And honestly, that’s not always a bad thing.



Most people don’t realize this, but clinical trials are designed for new drugs, not natural compounds.

If a company develops a chemical that’s never existed before — like an antidepressant or anesthetic — they need clinical trials to prove it’s safe and effective before it hits the market.

That process costs millions.

But herbs, roots, and natural extracts? Those have been around for centuries, sometimes even documented in ancient pharmacopeias.



So here’s the reality:

If an ingredient like Cnidium Monnieri or Morinda Officinalis has already been used for hundreds of years for circulation, nerve balance, or libido support, it’s technically already “tested” — just not in a modern, double-blind placebo study.

Instead of lab data, these rely on traditional use + modern extraction science.



That’s the gap where brands like EjaGuard sit.

They’re not selling a “new drug.” They’re using time-tested herbs in a cleaner, more controlled form — designed to support natural control rather than numb everything like a lidocaine spray.

It’s kind of like comparing caffeine in coffee (everyone knows it works, even without a prescription) vs. a brand-new stimulant that needs to go through FDA approval.



Of course, not all “herbal” stuff is equal. You still want transparency — proper labeling, known ingredients, and real user feedback.

That’s why I always check if the formula has consistent reviews and a clear explanation of what’s inside, instead of random “miracle blends.”



So if you’re wondering why you don’t see PubMed studies on every natural product — that’s why. It’s not because they don’t work. It’s because they’re not drugs that can be patented and funded for trials.



Sometimes, ancient knowledge plus real-world use says enough.

And if it gives you more control in bed without killing sensation? That’s already a win in my book.



What do you think — do you trust traditional formulas if they’ve been used for generations, or do you only go for things backed by clinical trials?",1,1762309289.0,Overcome_PE,0,1.0,False

Since people were respectful enough to not touch my mug at all, there is still the black coffee I made the day I lost my tumbler. I am a poor college student, so I am not sure I have money to buy fancy cleaning supplies or even a new tumbler (not to mention that I do love mine). I do have access to hot water, dish soap, dish sponge (obviously), and I also have some white vinegar. It is not an issue for me to buy some inexpensive cleaning tool though; but I do not want to get things blindly, that is why I hope to get some advice and follow it. I would truly appreciate recommendations on how to clean my baby! Thank you very much!

It’s a one day marketplace created by local musicians and open to everyone. The vendors are musicians sharing their off stage creativity including boutique builders, music shops, bakers, coffee roasters, photographers, artists, and more.

The event is free to attend and open to the public. We are currently looking for more Portland musicians and creative vendors who want to be part of it. Booth fees simply cover venue and event costs.

The goal is to bring together the Portland music and creative scenes in one space for a day of music, art, local goods, and community. Expect live DJs, great people, and a lot of inspiration.

More info and vendor sign up: [fivestarguitars.com/musiciansmarket]()

Hope to see some of you there or behind a table sharing your craft.",1,1762309085.0,musicians,0,1.0,False
